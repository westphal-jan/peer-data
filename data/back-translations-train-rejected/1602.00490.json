YOUTUBE ANALYSIS", "text": "In order to have a better understanding of the traffic characteristics in the case of encrypted video streaming over DASH with HTTP2 (safely), we examined YouTube traffic across different browsers and in fixed and automatic (auto) download modes. In fixed mode, the player downloads a fixed video quality with no quality adjustment. In automatic mode, the player selects the high-quality representation based on network conditions, browser resolution and buffer set. Figures 1 (a) -1 (d) show the different download patterns of a single video stream. Note that the original download includes TCP re-transmissions and we filter them using a TCP stack implementation. The different traffic patterns are mainly caused by the browser player algorithms. The source video coding process also affects the pattern differences. It is noteworthy that at the time of our database creation, YouTube had a Chrome Firefox HTMPlayer during Firefox."}, {"heading": "III. PROPOSED ALGORITHM", "text": "The proposed solution architecture consists of two classification methods and is illustrated in Fig. 4. The first two modules forward YouTube video streams only to the next modules. Each segment of network traffic enters the system separately and is first passed to the Connection Matching Filter. This filter is responsible for checking whether the incoming flow is new or ongoing, based on a five-fold representation: {Protocol (TCP / UDP), src IP, dst IP, src port, dst port}. If the incoming flow is new, the DPI filter decides whether it is a YouTube flow, based on the SNI field in the client hello message that is part of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol."}, {"heading": "A. Feature Creation", "text": "Our data crawler, identify an advertisement and click to skip it. Mostly due to the fact that the real video titles can be downloaded from multiple sources and the Server Name Indication (SNI) is not unique. As a result in this work, since we select the advertising after a few seconds (if it is allowed) we select the highest sum of bitrate as the starting point of the flow and only then we will start to create our features. This method has been considered accurate, but reduces our feature space. In addition, we let the advertising differentiate to future work. DASH is scattered over a TCP transport protocol. Streaming applications have a high bit rate consumption. Thus, feature creation methods have to consider TCP restrictions such as the passing of network problems. Retransmission adds additional data to the stream, which can cause classification of errors."}, {"heading": "B. Traffic Classification Algorithm - SVC with RBF Kernel", "text": "Each download was analyzed by the steps in 4, in which each download is presented as a feature vector with a length of 40 features (this is the maximum required feature length according to Section III-A. Downloads that do not have enough features are inserted with zeros. Each feature vector is standardized with Gauss, with 0 mean and unit variance. We used the well-known SVC with RBF kernel [34], where the regularization parameter C and \u03b3 with 5 folds cross-validation was found over the following sets: {2 \u2212 5, 2 \u2212 3,..., 215} and {2 \u2212 15, 2 \u2212 13,..., 23}."}, {"heading": "C. Traffic Classification Algorithm - Exact Nearest Neighbor using Hamming Distance", "text": "Define H = {0, 1}. The d-dimensional Hamming Space Hd consists of bit strings of the length d. Each dot x-Hd is a string x = {x0, x1,..., xd \u2212 1} of zero and one. At two dots x, y-Hd, the hamming distance dH (x, y) between them is the number of positions at which the corresponding strings differ, i.e., dH (x, y): = | i: xi 6 = yi |. When looking at two dots x, y-Hd, their hamming distance dH (x, y) in O (d) time for each y can be calculated. Define the search problem Exact Nearest Neighbor (ENN) based on a given set P of n dots in the Hamming Space Hd, and a query point q-Hd is a dot p-P, so that the hamming distance (H-dm) (the result of the single data sets of Hamming Space = 1) is determined."}, {"heading": "IV.

Dataset", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have established over the last five years."}, {"heading": "B. Accuracy Evaluation using Different Training Feature Threshold Levels", "text": "In this test, we evaluate different thresholds to find the best accuracy for our data sets. We use our entire training data sets with test adaptive test titles. Each feature threshold has been tested with three scenarios: without pre-processing filters, with pre-processing filters and with high bandwidth of audio signals. The pre-processing stage is responsible for the removal or partial removal of audio features. Based on fiddler, we analyze that low bit rate audio traffic features have much lower entropy compared to video rates. Audio traffic responses range from 65 KBytes to 440 KBytes. However, it is not always possible to differentiate in the encrypted traffic level between each audio / video response. We have found that the few initial features of the video server responses are not necessary to be unique and correlate to the TCP window state."}, {"heading": "C. Accuracy Evaluation using Different Training Dataset Sizes", "text": "In Fig. 8, we compare our detection rate with a different number of training video titles. We use 10 test videos for each track and present the average accuracy for each record size. The figure shows that the performance of the SVC classifier has increased significantly from 5 to 60 tracks. However, from 60 to 90, the increase in accuracy is only 4%. It is interesting to see that our proposed solution performs well even in a small record. If the record size is just a single download, we achieve an average accuracy of 79.66% with each increase in the record size, the accuracy improves up to 98%. For the rest of the test results, we will use our full record."}, {"heading": "D. Evaluation of Robustness to Delays and Packet Losses", "text": "In this section, we have artificially added additional packet losses and delays to the network. Packet losses have a very strong influence on player representation choices. We observed that in the regular scenarios, the quality of 720P deteriorated to 240P and 144P when they came into contact with a high packet loss ratio (9%). It is important to note that in our tests, we added additional packet losses before the data was collected. As a result, we can expect a low identification rate in this scenario. Fig. 9 (a) records the delay in our algorithm regarding the robustness of packet losses. We can observe that the SVC classifier is much more vulnerable to packet crashes than our proposed algorithm. If it encounters 1% packet loss, the SVC classifier falls from 72% to 51%, while we increase the loss of our SVC algorithm to 71% when it is not classified."}, {"heading": "E. Evaluation of Other Titles", "text": "In this section, we used 30 different titles that are not part of the training titles. We use our proposed solution because the last index indicates that the video was not classified as secret. From the evaluation results in Fig. 10, we can conclude that not even a title download feature was incorrectly classified as our training titles. Our future work will increase the number of video titles tested to understand the system accuracy in real-world use."}, {"heading": "V. CLASSIFICATION UPPER BOUND", "text": "In this section, we calculate the maximum upper limit for the maximum possible classification that is possible based on our methods."}, {"heading": "VI. FUTURE OF ENCRYPTED TRAFFIC CLASSIFICATION", "text": "Network anonymity is an important issue for Internet users, who have become significantly relevant with the development of encrypted network services. However, users transmit this encryption to hide their data transmission content and not allow their activity content to be associated with them. Recent work, such as the use of the VOIP stream VBR, has shown that encryption is not enough. However, a popular solution for providing client anonymity is the use of Onion Routing (OR). In OR, user content is promised anonymity through a number of tunnel solutions such as Tor [36], by passing data through multiple overlay nodes and using layered encryption of the content. Panchenko et al. [37] proposed to conduct a website fingerprinting attack via Tor in their solution, using TCP-ACK information that they consider irrelevant to Tor."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we present a novel HTTP-encrypted adaptive streaming video title classification algorithm for YouTube with Chrome browser. The solution was tested with.. We tested title recognition by uploading an euniqe video twice with the same name and classifying it with the suggested algorithm. The result of the classification was similar to our solution. We tried to download and re-upload our video, but this time the classification failed because the video was re-uploaded and YouTube re-encoded it and the fingerprint changed. Therefore, we conclude that the VBR pattern for title duplication with our solution can only work for data duplication with the same source and not with the same data with different encryption properties. We found that exploiting the VBR nature of the audio and video encoding may be suitable to recognize the title."}], "references": [{"title": "A Survey on Quality of Experience of HTTP Adaptive Streaming", "author": ["M.
