Introduction and background", "text": "Over the past three decades, the amount of content available on the Internet exceeds the amount of paper-based information in human history. It is estimated that about 50 million scientific articles have been published in our history (Jinha, 2010). Google estimates that there are more than 129 million published books in the world (Taycher, 2010), while there are about 4.6 billion web pages on the indexed web and nearly 550 billion individual documents on the unindexed web (Bergman, 2001). Forecasts suggest that the amount of data generated on the web is increasing by 40% annually (Larose, 2014). World Wide Web has offered people a novel way to express themselves in a variety of media such as wikis, question and answer databases, forums, review sites and social media. Accessible information and knowledge has also been made available to people around the world. Almost everything that can be found on the World Wide Web is structural. Even companies hold more than 80% of their information in a textual way."}, {"heading": "2. Methods and Implementation", "text": "The Marvin program is implemented in Java and can be used both as a library and as a standalone application. It has its main function, which allows it to run as a standalone program, but methods can also be used as libraries, since annotation methods are published. Currently, Marvin supports annotations with WordNet, MetaMap, DBpedia, and custom SKOS thesauri. Marvin can annotate some texts with all four knowledge sources or any combination of them, which can be configured in the configuration file (settings.cfg). Marvin's general workflow is shown in Figure 1. Text is tokenized first. Tokenization is performed using OpenNLP (Baldridge, 2005) and trained MaxEnt model provided by OpenNLP. After tokenization, annotations are performed on the tokens. Marvin's general workflow is shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "2.1. Annotating using DBpedia", "text": "When commenting using DBpedia, our approach is to generate unigrams, bigrams and trigrams from the supplied text. The basic idea is that there are a number of definitions on Wikipedia and DBpedia that are one, two or three words long. After the uniigram, bigrams and trigrams are generated; we capitalize the first letter, because names of DBpedia articles are always capitalized with the first letter. In addition, our approach represents the rest of the text in lowercase letters. Afterwards, we query DBpedia with the generated strings. The query is done via the SPARQL interface. For testing, we used the public DBpedia interface (http: / / dbpedia.org / sparql). However, this interface has certain limitations regarding the number of queries that can be submitted. In the case of larger texts, the interface can block the IP from which the queries come, resulting in SP3 workflows / sparql, and DTTP will be a larger instance for QL."}, {"heading": "2.2. Annotating using WordNet", "text": "While we make annotations by using WordNet, Marvin also does part-of-speech tagging on the text we enter, using the OpenNLP part-of-speech tagger based on a maximum English entropy model downloaded from the OpenNLP website. Part-of-speech tagging and tokenization is done in such a way that there is a part-of-speech tag for each token. Use of tokens and part-of-speech tags WordNet database is queried. The query returns all possible senses of the word with a given part-of-speech. Results from the query of WordNet contain senses that are not what the text is about. Only one sense of the word is the real sense in this context. With too many annotations for the senses, the annotations for the senses, the annotations may not be as useful as if they provided the right sense."}, {"heading": "2.3. Annotating using UMLS and MetaMap", "text": "Marvin is able to annotate text using UMLS (Bodenreider, 2004) using MetaMap (Aronson, 2001). Marvin can send annotation requests to the MetaMap server if it has the location of the MetaMap server. The user can configure the location of the server and its port in the settings.cfg file. UMLS concepts annotations are fully handled by MetaMap, and Marvin only enriches these annotations with prevalence information and word indexes."}, {"heading": "2.4. Annotating using Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)", "text": "So far, we have described annotations with WordNet, DBPedia and MetaMap. These methods use several well-established vocabularies and cannot be changed (apart from the vendor's updates), but when we perform tasks such as extracting information, it is sometimes necessary to use tailor-made dictionaries. We have provided a method for users to provide a number of custom vocabularies that our system will load and comment on using text. For the vocabulary input format, we have chosen to use a simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) format. Simple Knowledge Organization System is a vocabulary for RDF vocabularies that uses the Asian structure and content of concept schemes such as thesauri, classification schemes, terminologies, glossaries and other types of controlled vocabularies (Miles, et al al al al al., 2005), World Wide Web Vocabulary is expected to be developed by the Web Consortium for the presentation of standard and controlled vocabularies."}, {"heading": "2.5. Provenance", "text": "Provenance metadata is used to provide information necessary to verify the quality of the data, validate the data and associate trust values with it (Sahoo & Sheth, 2009).To determine which metadata will be included in the notes, we consulted PROV-O-Ontology (Lebo, et al., 2013).However, PROV ontology is general and does not contain specialized descriptions that would be able to clearly determine the source of the notes. We have changed some descriptions, but our provenance is based on PROV-O-Ontology. We retain the following metadata: Agent Name - the name of the agent who comments on the data. Users must define this variable in the annotation file."}, {"heading": "3. Summary and Future Works", "text": "In this report, we introduced Marvin, an application that is capable of annotating text using various semantic data resources, including MetaMap, WordNet, DBPedia, and custom thesauri that are presented in SKOS format. Marvin can be used as a command-line tool or as a Java library. We believe that many users can benefit from this, who want to use some of its features, but have control over what they use and allow them to customize the output for their purposes. However, the motivation for developing Marvin came from the need for a flexible text annotator to annotate and normalize tables. We needed annotated and normalized text in tables for information extraction purposes (Milosevic, et al., 2016). However, the tool is built to be universal for any type of text. In the future, we could expand our software to support more formats and annotation systems."}, {"heading": "4.
