Crowd workers complete simple binary microtasks whose results are aggregated to give the final decision. We consider the novel scenario where the workers have a reject option so that they are allowed to skip microtasks when they are unable to or choose not to respond to binary microtasks. For example, in mismatched speech transcription, crowd workers who do not know the language may not be able to respond to certain microtasks outside their categorical perception. We present an aggregation approach using a weighted majority voting rule, where each worker's response is assigned an optimized weight to maximize crowd's classification performance. We evaluate system performance in both exact and asymptotic forms. Further, we consider the case where there may be a set of greedy workers in the crowd for whom reward is very important. Greedy workers may respond to a microtask even when they are unable to perform it reliably. We consider an oblivious and an expurgation strategy for crowdsourcing with greedy workers, and develop an algorithm to adaptively switch between the two, based on the estimated fraction of greedy workers in the anonymous crowd. Simulation results show performance improvement of the proposed approaches compared with conventional majority voting.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Feb 2016 16:00:47 GMT  (573kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00575v1", "single column, 33 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Trans.

Of course, the answers to such \"gold standard\" questions are known to the manager [48], [49]. By checking the crowd worker's answers, \u00b5 can be estimated.

However, the number of equivalent classes is described as M = 8.Fig.2 compares the performance when W = 20 workers participate in the task. We consider here that workers are more likely not to give an answer to the micro question. A remarkable improvement in performance associated with our proposed approach is observed.

CROWDSOURCING SYSTEM WITH GREEDY CROWD WORKERS", "text": "In the previous section, we looked at conscientious crowd workers who respond only when they have confidence in their responsiveness. In our formulation, the weight assigned to a worker's response increases with the number of micro-activities to which the worker responds, and this contributes to the selection of the right class, thereby improving classification performance. In a reward-based system, such honest workers should be compensated and actually rewarded for completing as many tasks as possible. However, if there are workers in the crowd who are greedy and their goal is to receive as much compensation, regardless of the system goal of improved classification performance, such a reward mechanism may encourage greedy workers to randomly complete all micro-activities in order to receive a higher reward. This would result in a deterioration of the system's classification performance. In fact, Mason and Watts observed that increasing financial incentives increase the quantity of work done, but not necessarily the quality [50] when we fully investigate the system performance issues in this section of the Crowd."}, {"heading": "A.

Several papers have examined the estimate of \u03b1 in crowdsourcing systems [18], [21], [41], which can be divided into two categories: one examines the behavior of the workers compared to the honest control group [21]; the other learns the employee reputation profile [18], [41] which is stored and updated over time to identify the greedy from the mass. However, both categories of estimation methods are not suitable here due to the anonymity of crowd workers; the first category suffers from the difficulty of extracting the honest group from the anonymous mass, while the second requires identification of each worker."}, {"heading": "E.

Otherwise, we stick to the oblivious strategy. \u2212 As we can see from Figure 7 \u2212 if m decreases and \u00b5 increases, which means that the quality of the mass improves, the threshold increases.

Crowd workers complete simple binary microtasks whose results are aggregated to give the final result. We consider the novel scenario where workers have a reject option so they may skip microtasks when they are unable or choose not to respond. For example, in mismatched speech transcription, workers who do not know the language may not be able to respond to microtasks focused on phonological dimensions outside their categorical perception. We present an aggregation approach using a weighted majority voting rule, where each worker\u2019s response is assigned an optimized weight to maximize the crowd\u2019s classification performance. We evaluate system performance in both exact and asymptotic forms. Further, we consider the setting where there may be a set of greedy workers that complete microtasks even when they are unable to perform it reliably. We consider an oblivious and an expurgation strategy to deal with greedy workers, developing an algorithm to adaptively switch between the two based on the estimated fraction of greedy workers in the anonymous crowd. Simulation results show improved performance compared with conventional majority voting.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
