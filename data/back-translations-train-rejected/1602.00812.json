From the prespective of grammar design, type-logical grammars develop the syntactic and semantic aspects of linguistic phenomena hand-in-hand, letting the desired semantics of an expression inform the syntactic type and vice versa. Prototypical examples of the successful application of type-logical grammars to the syntax-semantics interface include coordination, quantifier scope and extraction.This chapter describes the Grail theorem prover, a series of tools for designing and testing grammars in various modern type-logical grammars which functions as a tool .

The Grail family of theory testers is designed to work with a variety of modern typlogic frameworks, including multimodal typlogic grammars (Moortgat 2011), NLcl (Barker & Shan 2014), displacement calculations (Morrill, Valent \u0301 \u0131n & Fadda 2011), and hybrid typlogic grammars (Kubota & Levine 2012). The tools provide a transparent way to implement grammars and test their consequences by providing a natural derivative in the specific typlogic grammar for each reading of a sentence.

This combination of linguistic and computational applications has proven to be very influential. In its general form, a typical grammar consists of the following components: 1. a logic that plays the role of the \"Universal Grammar\" mainstream linguistics1,2. a homomorphic theory ranging from this logic to intuitionist logic (linear) logic, this interface is the interface syntax interface, with intuitionistics that represents an intuitionistic theory of linguistics."}, {"heading": "2.1 The Lambek calculus", "text": "In fact, it is so that it is a way in which people are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want.

The Grail family of theorem provers have been designed to work with a variety of modern type-logical frameworks, including multimodal type-logical grammars (Moortgat 2011), NLcl (Barker & Shan 2014), the Displacement calculus (Morrill, Valent\u0301\u0131n & Fadda 2011) and hybrid type-logical grammars (Kubota & Levine 2012). The tools give a transparent way of implementing grammars and testing their consequences, providing a natural deduction proof in the specific type-logical grammar for each of the readings of a sentence. None of this replaces careful reflection by the grammar writer, of course, but in many cases, computational testing of hand-written grammars will reveal surprises, showing unintended consequences of our grammar and such unintended proofs (or unintended absences of proofs) help us improve the grammar. Computational tools also help us speed up grammar development, for example by allowing us to compare several alternative solutions to a problem and investigate their differences. This paper will describe the underlying formalism of the theorem provers, as it is visible during an interactive proof trace, and present the general strategy followed by the theorem provers. The presentation in this paper will be somewhat informal, referring the reader elsewhere for full proofs. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 will present a general introduction to type-logical grammars and illustrate its basic concepts using the Lambek calculus, ending the section with some problems at the syntaxsemantics interface for the Lambek calculus. Section 3 will look at recent developments in type-logical grammars and how they solve some of the problems at the syntax-semantics interface. Section 4 will look at two general frameworks for automated theorem proving for type-logical grammars, describing the internal representation of partial proofs and giving a high-level overview of the proof search mechanism.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
