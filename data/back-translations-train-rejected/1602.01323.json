State of the Art", "text": "The history of textual critique has seen the development of numerous classification methods. We will not attempt to attempt an exhaustive treatment here, but instead focus our attention on the following generalizations: (1) Base text: This method, used in NT textual critique in its earliest stages, is not only a method based on its deviation from a single base of measurements; the base could be anything, but historically it was the Textus Receptus (TR). Classes were formed on the basis of their common agreements against the base text. (2) Quantitative: This method, introduced by Colwell [8], compares the text of each MS with that of any other MS. Similarity is generally measured as a simple number or ratio of measurements against which two pairs of measures of similarity are measured, and is then used to group texts according to a variety of algorithms [9, 10] Profiles: The Claremont Profile Method (CPM), developed and developed by McReynolds."}, {"heading": "3. Theoretical Basis", "text": "In terms of fields most relevant to textual criticism, it has then found use in text mining for the purposes of document clustering and theme modeling [25], and in the mathematical basis of NMF is primarily a summary of the mathematical foundations of NMF, but the interested reader is encouraged to refer to [28] for detail questions. Suppose that we have a collation consisting of m measurements (with measurements in the same unit treated as different objects) and n MSS. We assume that a natural way to represent this collation is where the rows represent the measurements and the columns represent."}, {"heading": "4.

Classification of Lacunose MSS", "text": "In Section 4.1, we explained that in the process of data selection, we considered the texts of the correctors and witnesses with less than 300 measurements to be non-continuous and therefore secondary. Table 6 lists the MSS of Wasserman's collection that were too laconic to be included. Fortunately, due to their age, most papyri and uncivilized are so laconic that they must be excluded in this way, leaving us an unfortunate situation in which we cannot say anything about the MSS in which we are most interested. Fortunately, we are not without an antidote. Once NMF has produced a base matrix W for cluster readings at the primary level of continuous text witnesses, we can use this matrix to have the secondary witnesses according to whatever readings they may have. If we take x to be a vector that represents the measurements of a single secondary witness that we want to classify, then the solution h becomes the least quarial equation (6)."}, {"heading": "Appendix B.
