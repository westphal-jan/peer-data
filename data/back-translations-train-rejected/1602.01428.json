Instead of using raw corpus with primitive processing as input, an algorithm based on the vector space model and conditional entropy is used to link the subjective needs of social scientists with the outputs of unattended topic models. Space for adapting users to specific corpus of their interest is housed in our algorithm. We demonstrate the use of the toolkit on the diachronic popular corpus in Chinese. Several interesting \"key words\" such as \"Enlai Zhou\" (first prime minister of the People's Republic of China) and \"Cultural Revolution\" that might interest social scientists from different disciplines and the original corpus are used as input in our toolkit, then the most related topics are efficiently used for further research purposes."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Probabilistic topic models, such as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Lead, Ng and Jordan, 2003), are widely used as common tools to support the understanding of social scientists large, unstructured collections of documents. The value of topic models is recognized by social scientists as a tool for large document summaries and abstractions for economically and politically interesting facts such as Chinese censorship (Grimmer and Stewart, 2013; King, Robert and Pan, 2013; Tingley, Connor and Smith, 2012). Social scientists often begin with implementations of topic modeling that are widely available on the Internet. Then a variety of post-hoc evaluation of implementation outcomes, including topic prevalence and topic variation, can be performed. However, due to the topic models, we are predominantly unsupervised method. In this case, social scientists often have little to do with the topic generational process."}, {"heading": "2 The Two-Step Approach", "text": "\"Entering our\" Draw My-Topics \"Toolkit is an interesting word that is defined by the users!!!!!!!!!!\" We!!!!! \"We!!!!\" We!!!!!! \"We!!!!!\" We!!! \"We!!!!!!\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"We.\" We. \"\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\" We. \"We.\""}, {"heading": "3 Experimental Results and Online Visualization", "text": "In this part we will first show how the toolkit \"Draw My-Topics\" can effectively condense the size of the corpus, then we will show the topics that are drawn from the condensed corpus, finally we will show our online visualization platform. Online service and downloadable package will soon be provided. In the following table we will see that the size of the related corpus decreases significantly in the four cases (Enlai Zhou;, University of Beijing; Economy;, God of China) and will be used throughout 1957 as input of our toolkit. But our goal is to spread the topic and the content of the topic; will the condensed corpus work well? Here are the results in Table 4. Stopwords are removed from the corpus to distinguish the four topics. For the convenience of users to use our toolkit and other \"products,\" we will soon also build an online visualization platform based on the diachronic corpus of the \"People's Daily.\""}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We have developed the \"Draw My-Topics\" toolkit for social scientists to address their concerns and interests when using standard topic models. The main method is to use word similarity calculations based on Vector Space Model and Conditional Entropy to \"condense\" the original corpus. The compressed size is also helpful for large corporations where the training time of the topic model can be a bottleneck. Space for social scientists to incorporate their own judgments is also available. An online visualization platform and a downloadable package will be published soon. We are improving this work in two aspects: calculation and evaluation. In the calculation part, we hope to incorporate the diachronic ontology that we build on \"People's Daily\" (Shaoda He, et al. 2013) to improve the quality of the condensed corpus. The evaluation of the theme modeling is a fairly open question.
