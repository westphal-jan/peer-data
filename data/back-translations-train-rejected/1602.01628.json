The necessity of this generalization is dictated by the fact that the body of knowledge available to man is inaccurate, incomplete or diffuse in one sense [2]. Since Fuzzy Sets are an efficient apparatus for modeling objects and processes of this kind, it is useful to generalize and use KRMs. There are many similar generalizations, especially Fuzzy Logic, Fuzzy Semantic Networks, Fuzzy Production Models, Fuzzy Neural Networks, Fuzzy Ontologies, Fuzzy Frames, Fuzzy UML, etc. First of all, these KRMs are theoretical models that can be implemented practically within the framework of concrete intelligent information systems (IISs)."}, {"heading": "Object-Oriented Representation of Fuzzy Knowledge", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the objects are objects which, in terms of the way in which they have been defined, are not objects, but objects which, in terms of the way in which they have been defined, are objects which have been defined in terms of the way in which they have been defined, i.e. a property which has been expressed by means of a fuzzy set. [5] In this case, objects of an identical nature are introduced into the concept of a class within the framework in which they have been defined. Thus, each object is a concrete example of a specific class (type) of objects which are considered to be objects. In this case, a class is considered to be a certain prototype or an abstract object for the construction of concrete objects of a certain class. A class of objects is referred to as a blurred class if it has at least one blurred property. [8] A class of objects can be considered from two different positions, namely, a class of objects [9] expanded and intensified."}, {"heading": "Fuzzy Object-Oriented Dynamic Networks", "text": "As a matter of fact, the RP-RP-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D"}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper presents the conception of the object-oriented approach to the representation of blurred knowledge.
