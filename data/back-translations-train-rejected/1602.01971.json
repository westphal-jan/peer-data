Similar systems of localized and lattice-like cells have been discovered in many mammalian brains, including the human brain [3]. The term cognitive map was introduced by Tolman [13]. It describes the mental representation of spatial relationships between key points, places, ob-objects, etc. of our environment and possible connections between them [5]. Despite prevailing opinion, rats can only react to stimuli that Tolman performed [13]."}, {"heading": "1.2 Generalized knowledge", "text": "In many cases, a pathfinding problem is solved not only by information about the relationships of explicit points or objects (the cognitive map), but also by additional knowledge called generalized knowledge. People classify their surroundings and retrieve information, implications and expectations about the corresponding classes, for example railway stations, libraries, office buildings, etc. [1, 12]. Generalized knowledge does not concern the explicit design of the specific environment itself, but information about the type of environment or rather classification. Within buildings, we distinguish between two types of spaces (closed areas). On the one hand, there are spaces that serve the circulation of the building or rather allow people to efficiently reach their target areas. Corridors, entrances, lobbies, stairways, ramps, etc., belong to this group of spaces. On the other hand, there are spaces that are assigned to explicit use, which exclude circulation. With regard to the second type of spaces, we speak of functional spaces, we refer to communal spaces (offices, offices, etc.)."}, {"heading": "2 Modeling cognitive map knowledge", "text": "According to the findings mentioned in paragraph 1.1, we assume that a simulated person possesses a cognitive map consisting of uncertain, inaccurate information. Thus, the agent has only a vague idea of the exact (partial) target position. To this end, he chooses a door that leads him as close to the destination as possible, but is represented by ellipses (see fig. 1). We assume that the agent is looking for a route that leads him, preferably along the boundary line, to the exit area. Therefore, he chooses a door that leads him as close as possible to the target area. As the agent has no knowledge of the remaining structure of the building, his decision is made only by taking into account the position and shape of the actual space (and its doors) and the ellipse that represents the approximate position of the exit area."}, {"heading": "3 Examples", "text": "In the next section, we show how the model presented behaves in simple scenarios with respect to different spatial knowledge. In each scenario, an agent is located in a room in the lower left corner of a fictitious building (see Fig. 2) and looks for a way out. The entrance / exit is located in the lower right corner."}, {"heading": "3.1 Scenario 1: Cognitive map knowledge", "text": "On the basis of this scenario, we examine the effects of the application of the modeling approaches on explicit cognitive map knowledge (see paragraph 2). The broker assumes that the exit is located somewhere in the area represented by the ellipse in the lower right area. At each selection point, he decides to move in the direction that brings him closer to the assumed location of the exit. After starting his journey, the broker crosses the first corridor (bottom left corner) towards the opposite door, as it is obviously the best choice to approach the exit area, provided he has no knowledge of the structure behind the doors. However, as the broker realizes that he is in a dead end, he turns around and tries to reach the exit area by moving through the intersection into the adjacent room. Finally, he reaches the corridor in the middle of the building, which allows him to get to the lower right area of the building. In the ellipse, the exit area, he reaches the next exit area by finally going to the exit area that leads to the room."}, {"heading": "3.2 Scenario 2: Combination of generalized and cognitive map knowledge", "text": "Scenario 2 involves the combination of generalized and cognitive map knowledge. To highlight the effects of this combination, the agent also has the ability to distinguish between common areas and traffic spaces, with a sense of direction of the exit location. To this end, the color-coded spaces are designated as traffic spaces. Doors leading to these spaces are preferred by the agent. Furthermore, the agent follows the one in Section 2. We assume that the strategy of moving into or staying in a traffic area is more appropriate to keep the direction to the destination. Following this assumption, the pedestrian will use traffic spaces even though he will have to move seriously away from the boundary line to the exit area. If the agent leaves the exit area, he will go to the corridor in the middle of the building, as this is the only adjacent corridor. As he is located in the central corridor, the agent will have to choose between three corridors. Obviously, the corridor in the lower right corner is the best way to get closer to that agent without leaving the starting point in order to return to the destination corridor."}, {"heading": "4 Summary and Outlook", "text": "The modelling approaches presented in this paper provide simulated agents with limited information about their surroundings, rather than giving them access to global, comprehensive knowledge of each part of the environmental structure. Furthermore, the limited information consists of uncertainties and inaccuracies. The information status of agents can be manipulated by changing the position and size or shape of ellipses that model their actual cognitive map. Furthermore, it is conceivable to vary the level of knowledge of an agent by different modifications compared to other agents. Using two examples, we demonstrated the effects of different degrees of knowledge. The first example showed that the agent does not immediately find a suitable way out by simply heading for the exit area. In the second example (Section 3.2) it was shown that a vague, inaccurate idea of the destination in combination with the use of a search strategy is sufficient to find a route that leads directly (without detours) to the desired destination."}], "references": [{"title": "Cognitive psychology and its implications, 7th ed", "author": ["J.R.
