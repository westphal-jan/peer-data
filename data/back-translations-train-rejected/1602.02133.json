It includes a huge set of properties including the software quality. Opinion mining or sentiment analysis is concerned with analyzing textual user judgments. The application of sentiment analysis on software reviews can find a quantitative value that represents software quality. Although many software quality methods are proposed they are considered difficult to customize and many of them are limited. This article investigates the application of opinion mining as an approach to extract software quality properties. We found that the major issues of software reviews mining using sentiment analysis are due to software lifecycle and the diverse users and teams.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 19:42:24 GMT  (606kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02133v1", "11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["issa atoum", "ahmed otoom"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.02133"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.02133.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Mining Software Quality from Software Reviews: Research Trends and Open Issues", "authors": ["Issa Atoum", "Ahmed Otoom"], "emails": ["@article{Atoum2016,", "Issa.Atoum@wise.edu.jo", "aotoom@rjaf.mil.jo"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is as if it were a way of putting oneself at the centre.

A sentence is considered an objective sentence if it contains some factual information and is considered subjective if it expresses personal feelings, views, emotions or beliefs. For example, the sentence \"The tools of the layers need work\" is an objective sentence, while the sentence \"the great antivirus\" is a subjective sentence. However, it is not always easy to detect subjective sentences, because sometimes objective sentences can contain opinions, for example the sentence \"To use its best properties, you must have the paid version.\" It is an objective sentence, but it indicates a negative opinion about the software. Two classes of subjectivity recognition approaches have been proposed; the supervised and the unsupervised learning approaches may contain opinions, for example the sentence. \"In supervised learning approaches, subjectivity has been regularly solved as a classification problem [31]."}, {"heading": "Opinion Lexical Expansion", "text": "Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary"}, {"heading": "Classification", "text": "In fact, it is a very rare disease, which is only a very rare disease, which is only a very rare disease."}, {"heading": "Classification at the Feature Level", "text": "The method of aspect perception classification often uses a lexicon, a list of opinion words and phrases to determine the orientation of an aspect in a sentence [45], [55]. First, they marked opinion words as positive or negative. Next, they treated opinion shifters (valence shifters), and then aggregated opinion values as the sum of all opinions on the distance between word and aspect. Three main approaches are reported in the literature; monitored [60] [61] [61] [45] [62] [59], lexicon-based [63], [64] [65] [23], and theme modeling approaches [18], [21], [66], [67]. The challenge of the monitored approach is how to determine the scope of each emotional expression over the aspect of interest (i.e. dependence). Some of these works will be discussed in the next section."}, {"heading": "Feature Extraction", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the solution to the problems is not a solution, but a solution that is capable of bringing about a solution."}, {"heading": "Feature Grouping", "text": "The goal is to group features that have the same meaning in common. Aspect expressions must be grouped into synonymous aspect categories to present unique aspects. For example, short words like AV can represent an antivirus. Liu found that some aspects can be called in many forms; \"call quality\" and \"voice quality.\" Many synonyms are domain dependent [71]; film and image are synonyms in movie reviews, but they are not synonyms in camera reviews. Image synonyms refer to image and film refers to video.There are three important approaches to grouping: the use of semi-monitored learning features and their groups with appropriate rules [78], [94] - [96], theme models [97] and distributional / kinship or similarity measures [71], [99]."}, {"heading": "Opinion Summarization", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}], "references": [{"title": "Estimating the Helpfulness and Economic Impact of Product Reviews: Mining Text and Reviewer Characteristics", "author": ["A.
