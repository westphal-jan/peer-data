In addition, there are no hard and fast rules, each customer has a specific set of constraints (e.g. budget) and application requirements (e.g. minimum computational resources). Machine learning can help address some of the complicated decisions by carrying out customer-specific analytics to determine the most suitable instance type(s) and the most opportune time for starting or migrating instances. We employ machine learning techniques to develop an adaptive deployment policy, providing an optimal match between the customer demands and the available cloud service offerings.

The answers to the above questions are highly subjective; each customer application must carefully consider their requirements for different market offerings. Further complications arise from the different price models used by different cloud service providers (CSPs) and the rapid evolution of the ecosystem as a result of market forces. Thus, a customer entering the market is overwhelmed with a host of difficult questions without much support for such decision-making. We argue that we can help answer such questions more systematically and evidently."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Application Management Frameworks", "text": "A number of cloud brokering frameworks have been developed by industry and open source communities to mediate between cloud customers and vendors [2], which perform some tasks on behalf of the customer, such as arbitrage, aggregation and integration. We classify such solutions as either hosted or deployable. Hosted services are managed externally by third parties and do not provide information on how the application is delivered. Examples include RightScale Cloud Portfolio Management, enStratus, xStream and CliQr. By contrast, deployable services rely on open source software that could be operated either internally by a company or externally as a grey box service. Apache Brooklyn, Scalr, Standing Cloud and Aelous are just a few examples. The solutions mentioned so far deal with interoperability to reduce application friction, but do not support adaptive decision-making. This feature is still largely absent from cloud brokerage solutions [26, although some SOOSC, SMOC, AIC] efforts have begun."}, {"heading": "2.2 Machine Learning", "text": "Machine learning can make a huge contribution to making appropriate decisions to meet specific application requirements. Machine learning has proven its potential for producing prediction and optimization solutions in various areas. It has been applied in cloud computing towards resource scaling [16], forecasting [5] and dynamic resource delivery [13, 1, 9]."}, {"heading": "3 Daleel", "text": "Daleel (meaning \"guide\" in Urdu) is a multi-criterion, adaptable decision framework that provides a cloud customer with evidence-based knowledge of the IaaS setup specification that is optimal for their application.3.1 ArchitectureDaleel's architecture (illustrated in Fig. 2) consists of three main modules: decision support, actuator and knowledge base. At the heart of the architecture is the Decision Support module, which is based on a three-phase process that works continuously throughout the application lifecycle to predict application performance. These phases are: analysis, learning and planning. They perform various but complementary operations to gain in-depth knowledge of the cloud deployment options available and their suitability for a particular application. The actuator replaces the Decision Support module in operation based on application performance. The knowledge base, the Decision Support module, as well as the CSP support module, holds the Decision Data Base."}, {"heading": "3.2 Analysis Phase", "text": "The first stage consists of a profiling process based on the analysis of time series. Application profiling is an effective method of tracking application behavior under different deployment constellations, either live on shared cloud infrastructures (whether public or private) or offline in a fully controlled and isolated virtual environment. Tracks obtained capture different metrics such as CPU and memory usage, paging and caching information, etc. Together, these form the application profile that can predict deployment options that can meet the application and customer requirements. Summarizing different application profiles builds the knowledge base with information about application descriptions and their behavior on different deployment constellations, which is used to derive the performance of an application that has not yet been profiled based on its vignette (i.e. general description)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Learning Phase", "text": "This second phase consists of a learning procedure that derives the following information from the analysis phase: performance traces, cloud resource portfolio and the application vignette. A key task is to derive a prediction model for the relevant cloud provider that shows the QoS variations and services offered in order to help the next phase (i.e. planning) achieve optimal deployment that takes into account customer constraints. The learning phase aims to learn the prediction model in order to accurately predict the cost of application execution in terms of the performance and price of the virtual machine (VM), and also aims to achieve a better understanding of the correlation between the prediction methods and the response in order to infer a relationship for future predictions."}, {"heading": "3.4 Planning Phase", "text": "The third phase involves input from the learning phase in the form of a predictive model that can generate a vector output based on the customer's input requirements. Planning logic supports a multi-criterion decision problem where a series of vectors describing performance is the learning outcome. For the purposes of this study, we are targeting two QoS attributes as our criteria, namely VM price and application execution time. Various methods are used in multi-criterion decision making, such as weighted sum [18], weighted product [19], VIKOR [17] and PROMETHEE [4] (see [26] for more details). We intend to include such multi-criterion techniques in our decision support taking into account more than two QoS attributes (i.e. more than one customer-dictated target)."}, {"heading": "3.5 The Actuator", "text": "The Actuator triggers the decision support module at different times in operation. This could be based on thresholds that are set according to customer limitations in terms of application QoS, application load or knowledge base information (e.g. changes in a provider's portfolio). Such triggers lead to new analysis and learning cycles or activate the planning logic to start the migration to a new cloud infrastructure. Migration between different cloud infrastructures is in itself a major challenge and lies outside the limits of this work. However, the planning logic could easily be extended to migration methods, e.g. [11]."}, {"heading": "4 Analysis of Variability in IaaS Offerings", "text": "Choosing the specifications of a cloud-based infrastructure is not an easy or straightforward task, especially given that there is a significant level of performance variability at every level of service delivery. Our first step is to gather enough information to analyze this variability through extensive experimentation with the Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) IaaS offering. In this section, we explain the setup, profile process and performance variability analysis."}, {"heading": "4.1 Methodology", "text": "The overall objective of this evaluation is to determine the performance fluctuations at different node configurations at different times of day. EC2, the leading IaaS provider with a market share of 57% [25], is conducting this experiment. We are investigating different instance types and seven days a week to investigate temporal fluctuations."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Infrastructure", "text": "Note that \"vCPU\" indicates the number of virtual cores assigned to a VM. \"ECU\" refers to an EC2 processing unit; Amazon does not indicate how an ECU relates to the physical processing speed; it merely asserts that itis is a standard unit within its IaaS offerings1. \"Price\" refers to the hourly cost of operating a VM of the referenced instance type. However, Amazon provides differentiated instance series that address different application needs (e.g., compute-intensive, memory-intensive, I / O-intensive, etc.). Each series contains a number of instance types with different constellations of computing resources. We have targeted the General Purpose T2 and M3 series, as well as the Compute Optimised Series C4 to evaluate different combinations of resource capacities over a relatively wide price range."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Application & Execution", "text": "Our example of use was VARD [3], a tool for recognizing and labeling spelling variations in historical texts, especially in Early Modern English. The output aims to improve the accuracy of other body analysis solutions. VARD is a one-strand application that is very memory-intensive. It includes a representation of the full text as well as various dictionaries used to normalize spelling variations. Experiments were repeated continuously, using a fixed set of input texts over a seven-day period with a ten-minute delay between each pair of runs. To continuously monitor resource usage, the Linux tools vmstat, Peeks, and Sysstat were used."}, {"heading": "4.2 Variation Due to Instance Type", "text": "The results are summarized in Fig. 3, where each point represents the execution time of a run. Shorter execution times reflect a lower hourly rate at full utilization. There are several notable observations. First, m3.medium (a memory-rich instance) is consistently poor performance. We also observe that c4.large outperforms both m3.medium and m3.large in performance. In fact, it is on par with c4.xlarge, which is twice as high in both specification and cost. Overall, the T2 series offers by far the best price-performance ratio. One possible explanation is the CPU Credits Scheme, offered only in the T2 series, which allows customers to collect credits for unused instances and issue them later when full CPU utilization is required. T2 instances are therefore good for applications that do not consistently use the CPU fully and accumulate CPU credits at an equal rate of interest. But it also means some degree of uncertainty."}, {"heading": "4.3 Variation Due to Time", "text": "The T2 series offers the smallest amount of memory, but has the smallest performance discrepancy between weekdays. m3.medium VMs show execution times of applications that are relatively high but predictable: the median and quartzites show very small differences across weekdays. m3.large also shows the smallest performance discrepancy between weekdays. on the other hand, amazon.com / ec2 / faqs / provides fairly predictable performance over the week, with a narrow first quartile that is beneficial; the two C4 instance types represent contrasting performance deviations. c4.large is more predictable with a steady middle and right skew (i.e. a very narrow first quartile); on the other hand, the dispersion in the c4.xlarge instances is stronger towards the high end of application execution period."}, {"heading": "4.4 Lessons Learned", "text": "We investigated how variable the performance resulting from different IaaS settings could be, which makes the execution of a simple application quite uncertain. This shows that public IaaS offerings are largely black boxes. First, the selection of instance types is not necessarily optimal based on the advertised resource specifications alone. Second, the selection of the day of the week on which an application is to run could result in significant performance fluctuations."}, {"heading": "5 Learning Evaluation", "text": "We use various machine learning algorithms to predict the best IaaS deployment setup for a particular application. We re-use the VARD application (see Section 4.1.2) as a use case, with the aim of predicting the optimal resources and timing for starting an EC2 instance to run VARD. We first describe how to search for and evaluate the best models, then we detail the results of our study."}, {"heading": "5.1 Model Development and Evaluation Method", "text": "The core technique of our methodology, which can effectively predict execution time, is based on polynomial regression. Polynomial regression is an approach of nonlinear adjustment to data [12]. It expands the linear model by adding additional predictors that are obtained by increasing each of the original predictors to a performance. We take the execution time of the application as a response variable, while following the procedure outlined below, to obtain a robust model that can accurately predict the response using the predictive results. 1. Divide the data into two sets: a training set to be used for learning, and a test sample for evaluation and model evaluation. For the current evaluation, we divide the data into training and test sets at a ratio of 57% and 43% respectable.2. into the model."}, {"heading": "5.1.1 Polynomial Fit", "text": "The multivariate polynomial model is a special case of a basic function approach that we used in our learning model. The idea of using a basic function is to have a transformation that can be applied to a variable X: b1 (X), b2 (X),... bk (X). Basic functions are fixed and known, so the least square approach can be used to estimate the unknown regression coefficients in the above model. A robust polynomial model is created using profile results. This model is an attempt to predict the execution time with two significant predictors RAM and vCPU, plus an additional: day of the week. This third predictor cannot describe the underlying distribution function alone; instead, it presents a meaningful result in a combinatorial way. This polynomial regression model takes the following form: F (x) = size 01 + x1 + + size + 2\u03b22 + 12\u03b232x x is evaluated in 3."}, {"heading": "5.2 Model Accuracy Analysis", "text": "To evaluate the accuracy of our model, we compared it with various learning models using the standard methods described in Section 5.1. Due to the lack of previous models, we used other learning techniques as a starting point for the comparison, namely linear regression, ridge regression and lasso. The same data sets and methods were used to extract and evaluate the results."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Baseline Models", "text": "Linear models are relatively easy to implement and can provide a good interpretation and conclusion. Least quadratic criteria are used for precise coefficient estimates [21]. In addition to our assumption of linear regression, we have tried to adapt the model, which contains all variables, using a technique that reduces coefficient estimates to zero. We have used the two known regression techniques to shrink the regression coefficients: comb regression (also known as Tikhonov regression [28]) and the least absolute shrink and selection operators (Lasso) [27]. Comb regression is similar to the least quadratic, but minimizes the coefficient estimates with a slightly different quantity of tuning parameter \u03bb [14]."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Diagnostic Assessment", "text": "We are now evaluating the accuracy of the models as summarized in Table 2. However, the evaluation of the standard values for the identity of the lasso and the spine regression models indicate that none of the \u03bb values has reduced the MSE. In fact, the best \u03bb values (i.e. those that have a minimum MSE, \u03bb = 2.30 for spine and \u03bb = 0.03 for lasso) have even higher MSE than those when the function is derived from the least square fit. The best \u03bb value was obtained using cross-validation technology.When switching to other regression diagnostics (not suitable for spine or lasso), the R2 statistic provides the proportion of the variance explained by the predictor X, and thus always takes a value between 0 and 1. The low R2 value for linear regression indicates that this model has not explained much of the variability in the answer; much less than half the difference, in fact."}, {"heading": "5.3 Model Fitting Outcomes", "text": "\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf"}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have examined the role of machine learning in enabling such adaptive decision-making; a general architecture called Daleel has been proposed (\u00a7 3) and an empirical evaluation has been carried out to examine how key phases of analysis and learning can be supported in preparation for future planning.The analysis focuses on decision-making around the execution of a particular application in a particular cloud provider; specifically, our empirical study focuses on decision-making around the selection of instance types for the execution of VARD, an application in the field of computational linguistics.The results show that the performance of instance types varies significantly over time and is often counterproductive."}], "references": [{"title": "Predicting cloud resource provisioning using machine learning techniques", "author": ["A.A.

an incredibly fast moving one. In addition, there are no hard and fast rules; each customer has a specific set of constraints (e.g. budget) and application requirements (e.g. minimum computational resources). Machine learning can help address some of the complicated decisions by carrying out customer-specific analytics to determine the most suitable instance type(s) and the most opportune time for starting or migrating instances. We employ machine learning techniques to develop an adaptive deployment policy, providing an optimal match between the customer demands and the available cloud service offerings.
