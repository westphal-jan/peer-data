General data mining methods, based on machine learning, face challenges on the scale of text data and require scalable text mining methods. This thesis proposes a solution for scalable text mining: generative models combined with sparse computation. It defines a unifying formalization for generative text models that unites research traditions that have used formally equivalent models but ignore parallel developments. This framework allows the use of methods developed in different processing tasks, such as retrieval and classification, resulting in effective solutions for different text mining tasks. It will use a frugal computation using inverted formally suggested indices to draw paralleled conclusions, but ignore indices."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction 1", "text": "1.1 Motivation..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."}, {"heading": "2 Text Mining and Scalability 7", "text": "......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................"}, {"heading": "3 Multinomial Naive Bayes for Text Mining 38", "text": "The question of whether it is a coincidence or not does not arise, the question of whether it is a coincidence or not."}, {"heading": "4 Reformalizing Multinomial Naive Bayes 61", "text": "4.1 Formalizing Smoothing.. 614.1.1 Smoothing Methods for Multinomials........................... 614.1.1 Smoothing Methods for Multinomials.........

Text mining (TM) in a broader sense refers to technology that allows the use of large amounts of text data. Below, this working definition is defined by a more concise one.Text mining comes from several previous research fields, such as data mining, machine learning, information processing, natural language processing. Like these fields of computer science, TM has a significant impact on applied artificial intelligence [Fayyad et al., 1996, Witten, 2004].

Therefore, it is necessary to use simplified representations of text to perform any processing of text that is natural to humans. It uses different representations of text that depend on the use, which are also referred to as intermediate forms [Tan, 1999] or representation models [Feldman and Sanger, 2006]. In the following discussion, formal notation is introduced, which is widely used in the later chapters of the thesis. NLP often uses text that is processed in some kind of standardized form. This is a form of text with all nonlinguistic elements removed or separated from the text content, and the text is coded using a standard such as ASCII or Unicode. The text can then be further standardized to remove unwanted variations."}, {"heading": "2.2.3 Text Mining Applications as Machine Learning Tasks", "text": "One possible way to categorize the applications is to use ML terminology and take into account the underlying learning problem that is solved in each application [Feldman and Sanger, 2006, Aggarwal and Zhai, 2012]. This makes it possible to compare solutions that are used in different application areas, and to try solutions that are used for non-text tasks of the same task type. The basic framework of ML is described next, followed by a mapping of many common TM tasks in ML problems. A generally accepted definition of ML is said to learn from the experience of E in relation to some tasks T and performance measurements P when their performance is measured in T, improves with experience E. [Mitchell, 1997] for an example application of email spam filters, the experience of email filtering could be a training dataset of spam / non-email examples, the task T could be reclassification of new examples of examples."}, {"heading": "2.2.4 Linear Models as Methods for Text Mining", "text": "The new algorithmic methods based on statistics and learning have brought about a paradigm shift in the field of artificial intelligence, and there remain few areas of TM where solutions based solely on expert knowledge are preferred.

Tasks that are usually solved using linear models include regression, classification, and ranking."}, {"heading": "2.2.5 Text Mining Architectures as KDD Processes", "text": "The processing of data into structured forms and the application of ML to solve tasks are the basic building blocks of TM.

The concept of TM architecture arises from considering TM as a case of the KDD process [Feldman and Dagan, 1995, Feldman et al., 1997, Ahonen et al., 1997a]. The concept of a basic KDD process consists of five steps [Fayyad et al., 1996]: 1) selection, 2) pre-processing of data, 3) transformation, 4) data mining and 5) evaluation.

For each label in comb dev.txt, optimal reference weights are approximated by evenly distributing a weight of 1 among the base classifiers that achieve the highest values on the performance measurement. At first, fscore was used as a measurement because averaging of fScores on the labels yields maFscore. However, no ranking information is used in the instance rates.A small improvement in maFscore was achieved by using a similar measurement that takes ranking information. ca.OracleWeights () and updateEvaluationResults () in MetaComb2.java show how the reference vote weightings are constructed. Following the prediction of the voice weight, the Label \u2192 Instance Score is selected for each instance from the weighted voices in the function of the vote information, the threshold information (a combination of which is used in a preclassification)."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX B.

Development of the ensemble by n-fold cross-validation can be done by changing the global variable \"developmentRun\" in MetaComb2.java to 1. SelectClassifiers.py classifiers can be selected by removing the classifiers as integer arguments to MetaComb2. The list of removed classifiers used in the final evaluation in RUN METACOMB was created by running the classification selection script SelectClassifiers.py with the n-fold cross-validation.

Other participants noticed this problem of maFscore optimization, but probably most of them did not find a good solution. Using metafeature regression in the ensemble instead of majority tunings resulted in a moderate improvement of about 0.5%, and this was much needed for victory.

Much of this is in text form, insurmountable in scope for humans and incomprehensible in structure for computers. Text mining is an expanding field of research that seeks to utilize the information contained in vast document collections. General data mining methods based on machine learning face challenges with the scale of text data, posing a need for scalable text mining methods. This thesis proposes a solution to scalable text mining: generative models combined with sparse computation. A unifying formalization for generative text models is defined, bringing together research traditions that have used formally equivalent models, but ignored parallel developments. This framework allows the use of methods developed in different processing tasks such as retrieval and classification, yielding effective solutions across different text mining tasks. Sparse computation using inverted indices is proposed for inference on probabilistic models. This reduces the computational complexity of the common text mining operations according to sparsity, yielding probabilistic models with the scalability of modern search engines. The proposed combination provides sparse generative models: a solution for text mining that is general, effective, and scalable. Extensive experimentation on text classification and ranked retrieval datasets are conducted, showing that the proposed solution matches or outperforms the leading task-specific methods in effectiveness, with a order of magnitude decrease in classification times for Wikipedia article categorization with a million classes. The developed methods were further applied in two 2014 Kaggle data mining prize competitions with over a hundred competing teams, earning first and second places.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
