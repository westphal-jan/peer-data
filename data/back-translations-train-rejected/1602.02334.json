Conclusions", "text": "We have shown that matching dependencies, a new class of semantic constraints on data quality and purification, can be profitably integrated with traditional ML methods, in our case for the development of classification models for entity resolution. These dependencies play a role not only in their intended goal of blocking the merging of duplicate representations, but also in the record-blocking process that precedes the correct learning task. At this stage, they capture declarative semantic information that can be used to enrich the blocking activity. MD's explanation and enforcement, data processing in general, and machine learning can all be integrated using the LogiQL language. In fact, all data extractions, movements, and transformation tasks are performed via LogiQL, a form of extended database supported by the LogicBlox platform. In this regard, it is interesting to mention that Datalog has existed since the early 1980s, as a declarative and rule-based language for databases."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.
