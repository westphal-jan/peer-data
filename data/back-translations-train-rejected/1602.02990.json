In traditional approaches, the controller, by its internal functionality, finds appropriate actions on the basis of the history of sensor values, guided by the goals, intentions, objectives, learning schemes, and so on planted into it. The idea is that the controller controls the world---the body plus its environment---as reliably as possible. This paper advocates for a new paradigm of control, obtained by making the world control its controller in the first place. The paper presents a solution with a controller that is devoid of any functionalities of its own, given by a fixed, explicit and context-free function of the recent history of the sensor values. When applying this controller to a muscle-tendon driven arm-shoulder system from the Myorobotics toolkit, we observe a vast variety of self-organized behavior patterns: when left alone, the arm realizes pseudo-random sequences of different poses but one can also manipulate the system into definite motion patterns. But most interestingly, after attaching an object, the controller gets in a functional resonance with the object's internal dynamics: when given a half-filled bottle, the system spontaneously starts shaking the bottle so that maximum response from the dynamics of the water is being generated. After attaching a pendulum to the arm, the controller drives the pendulum into a circular mode. In this way, the robot discovers affordances of objects its body is interacting with. We also discuss perspectives for using this controller paradigm for intention driven behavior generation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Feb 2016 14:16:26 GMT  (329kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02990v1", "13 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 12:37:19 GMT  (1069kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02990v2", "11 pages, 4 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["ralf der", "georg martius"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.02990"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.02990.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Self-organized control for musculoskeletal robots", "authors": ["Ralf Der", "Georg Martius"], "emails": ["<ralfder@ist.ac.at>,", "<gmartius@ist.ac.at>"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: self-organization, robot control, musculoskeleton, tendon drive, learning, anthropomimetics, self-exploration"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to surpass themselves, to surpass themselves and to surpass themselves are able to surpass themselves. The complexity of programming poses a challenge for decades in which considerable progress has been made lately. [11] The improved control theory [30], but especially the huge increase in computer performance that allows modeling and physically realistic simulation of very complex systems to improve planning and control, even allows simulation of large muscular body systems [35], or the search for new perspectives for artificial evolution [2]."}, {"heading": "2 Self-organized control for soft robots", "text": "The controller that we propose is a conservative element that is consistent by the subsequent self-requirement. We have a vector of motor values yt-Rm. As we aim at the self-organization of the controller, we must define the control signals in a self-consistent manner based on the history of sensor signals alone. In order to have a non-trivial behavior, the vector of future sensor values must be mild, in which we have a time delay with self-destabilizing derivatives (time is measured in discrete update steps, here up to 100 / sec).In order to have a non-trivial behavior, the sensor loop must be mild, which leads to self-stimulated behaviors. In this sensor motor loop, the controller regulates the energy input. Destabilization can be achieved by increasing the general feedback strength. To maintain this destabilization, we need a conservative element, we need a conservative element."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "The controller defined above was used in the experiments with a tendon-driven arm-shoulder system from the Myorobotics toolkit [15], see Fig. 1. The system has 11 artificial muscles, 8 in the shoulder and 2 in the elbow and one that affects both. However, two of the shoulder muscles have been uncoupled. The muscles consist of a motor that pulls a tendon connected to a spring, see Fig. 1 (b). The length of a tendon l is specified by the motor encoders and the spring force is translated into a length s in the interval [\u2212 \u03b1, 1 \u2212 \u03b1], where \u03b1 defines the pretension (here \u03b1 = 0.1). The length of the tendons is normalized to l [\u2212 1, 1]. We define the sensor values asxi = li + \u00dfsi (5), where \u03b2 regulates the integration of the spring length. In the experiments \u03b2 was simply set to 1 without further adjustment. This choice is not expected to be critical."}, {"heading": "3.1 Peculiarities of muscle-tendon driven systems", "text": "There are a number of features that distinguish the musculoskeletal tendon-driven systems (MTD) from the classical robots, which have rotary joints with direct motor control, i.e. the motor positions translate directly into joint angles and poses. The most obvious effect is when the tendons weaken, causing total loss of contact with the physical condition of the arm. This must be avoided by maintaining a permanent tension on the tendons, which is another problem: the tension can only be achieved by tightening each tendon against all the others, with each individual tension being reported by the length of the spring. This means that (i) there are infinite combinations of tensile forces for one arm and (ii) that the effect of a single motor is reflected in a change in the spring length of all the other muscles. In other words, the operation of a single muscle is reflected by a pattern of sensory stimulation - a whole-body combination that generates friction and multiple muscle combinations."}, {"heading": "3.2 Self-regulation, manipulability, and goal orientation", "text": "We performed several experiments listed in Tab. 1, which show the main characteristics of the control scheme. All experiments are performed with the same controller with the same initialization (C = 0), so that only the physical situation differs between the experiments. We will keep this work mainly at the level of the phenomena and provide a more in-depth analysis in a later essay. We recommend using the videos for a better understanding."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Self-regulated working regime", "text": "Before presenting the experiments in detail, let's take a look at the sensorimotor coupling generated by this controller. One of the key features is the self-regulation into a working regime in which the tendons are kept under tension even during very fast movements under considerable stress. This is very important as it guarantees that the signals from the controller are clearly executed. As a result, in all experiments we have never had to deal with a shoulder dislocation, see Figure 1 (c), which can occur immediately when the tendons come loose. This is all the more surprising as this meaningful work regime arises without any additional adjustment or calibration of the system [34]. For this, the special sensor configuration equivalent (5) seems to be important, but we have not yet systematically studied it and expect other configurations to work."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Manipulability", "text": "The dominance of the sensor reactions in the control system makes the controlled system manipulable by externally applied forces. The point is that all additional forces acting on the arm segments change the sensor values due to the changing spring stress. This effect integrates manipulative influences - such as a physical robot interaction - into the sensor values and thus into the metsystem in which it relaxes when the mechanical degrees of freedom are manually frozen. This is not because the motors are too weak. Instead, x-0 is a fixed point of dynamics that succeeds in freezing the mechanical degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the system can be drawn into specific behaviors through manual interaction. We demonstrate this in the handshake experiment, see video 2, where the user tries to move the arm in a periodic pattern."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Perspectives for goal oriented behavior", "text": "The idea is based on the observation that the metsystem (the physical system with the controller that regulates the energy input) exhibits completely different physical characteristics from the \"naked\" or passive system (the motor power is turned off). Specifically, the self-amplification is dampened by a second controller acting on the metsystem - let's call it the meta-controller - so that the meta-system enters a plastic state of aggregation. In this particular regime, patterns are present as mere potentials waiting to be aroused. It is easy to imagine that by a second controller - let's call it the meta-controller - acting on the meta-system, it is more reliable to propel the meta system toward these latent behaviors than by acting on the \"naked\" physical system. If we are able to manipulate the meta system by hand, why not simply by imposing additional motor signals on the self-regulated system a meta meta system system that resembles the one above?"}, {"heading": "3.3 Emerging modes", "text": "As mentioned above, the meta-system with the transition operator L \u0442 is particularly similar to periodic movements, i.e. there is a plethora of latent boundary cycle attractors waiting metaphorically for their excitation. In other words, the selection of a specific attractor is realized by the self-amplification of a dynamic seed that is generically provided by a physical subsystem (the world) with a temporally coherent internal dynamics. In other words, the subsystem - through its internal dynamics - steers the meta system into a resonant state, i.e. an integral system mode with a defined frequency. This prominent phenomenon is a direct consequence of the fact that the world is assigned the leading role in behavior generation. In the following experiments, we feed additional delayed sensor values that enhance the affinity to periodic behaviors, see Section 5.3."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Self-excited pendulum modes", "text": "In a first experiment, we set a weight (the bottle) from the tip of the arm. In this experiment, the world consists of the arm together with a physical subsystem - this pendulum - with a complex internal dynamics. However, with the pivot point at rest, the pendulum can realize elliptical or even circular motion patterns with fixed frequency. By a driven pivot point, the pendulum is able to realize chaotic movements under certain trajectories of the pivot point. In any case, the movements of the weight exert small forces on the arm, which change the spring stresses and thus the sensor values."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 The emerging cocktail shaker", "text": "In the next phase, we will get a bottle of water into the bottle, both in horizontal and vertical orientation. These experiments should support our hypothesis that the water touches either the walls or the bottom of the bottle."}, {"heading": "3.3.3 Discovering object affordances and tool use", "text": "The observed resonance phenomena are closely related to the concept of affordability of objects. As Gibson [7] introduced, affordability is a means of action available to an individual in the environment. Depending on the capacity to act, affordability defines the relationship between an agent and his environment through his motor and sensory abilities (e.g. tangible, movable or edible). In this sense, we can say that the metsystem discovers the possibility of pushing the pendulum pendulum pendulum into a circular motion by moving the pivot point in a certain way. In this sense, it is an affordability that a pendulum can offer in this specific environment. Interestingly, this discovery can only be achieved through the emerging activity of the entire system with the pendulum based on the very weak interactions in the arm-pendulum physical system. In the same sense, if we give the robot the half-filled bottle, through which (by the inertia of the forces) of the water system already provide a wheel with possible actions."}, {"heading": "3.4 Reaching", "text": "The functionality of the current control paradigm is essentially based on two different scenarios. On the one hand, we have observed a strong affinity for periodic movements such as the pendulum or bottle shaking methods, which are predominantly associated with time scales defined by \u03c1 to the expected periodicity. There, we observe that the dynamic operator L \u0441 is essentially constant and qualified by (a pair) complex eigenvalues that determine the frequency of oscillations. In other time horizons, which are either shorter or do not correspond to the periodicity of a latent mode, we observed another amazing variety of behavior patterns that give the impression that the robot intentionally creates sequences of different poses, see video 7. This scenario is characterized by an L \u00b2 that varies strongly on the time scale of the behavior itself. Although these motion sequences look rather random, it is important to note that it is not artificial randomness that the controller is planted."}, {"heading": "4 Summary and outlook", "text": "This year, we will be able to try to find a solution that we are able to find, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution. \""}, {"heading": "5 Appendix: Methods", "text": "In this section we derive the controller matrix C, discuss the role of the sensor for the motor mapping matrix M and give the update rule for C."}, {"heading": "5.1 The controller", "text": "The idea is to generalize this expression in a way that is consistent for a certain time.

(15). Let us now hypothetically assume that A represents exactly the sensor response of the arm to motor actions, i. e. let us assume that X is A = M \u2212 1 and E = 0. Then the pair of Eqs [1, 2] is degenerated into a triviality so that the system can realize any trajectory realization. Thus, the actual point of interest represented by the true behavior and the temporary reaction becomes."}, {"heading": "5.3 Eliciting periodicity", "text": "To make the meta-system more attractive for motion patterns of a certain period T, we introduce a vector xt \u2212 T / 2 of the delay sensor values together with a second controller matrix Ct | \u2212 T / 2 and define the vector of motor commands asyt = g (Ctxt + Ct | \u2212 T / 2xt \u2212 T / 2) (16), with Ct | \u2212 T / 2 = Mt | \u2212 T / 2 < x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x-T / 2 \u2212 1 P (17) and Mt | \u2212 T / 2 translating motor values at a time t into sensor values at a time t \u2212 T / 2. Note that Mt | \u2212 T / 2 may be different from Mt. If the system is in a periodic regime, we have xt = \u2212 T / 2 and therefore also find < x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x-T / 2 \u2212 true for the entire period."}, {"heading": "5.4 Some technical details", "text": "In the practical applications we have performed so far, we have identified a number of optimizations to address the specifics of the approach. One is the choice of the time delay between x and x, which was x-t = xt + 1 above. However, there is no obstacle to introducing a specific delay behavior, so that x-t = xt + \u03b8. This is helpful to adjust the system to the actual refresh rate, and in particular to increase the chance of periodic patterns. It also affects to some extent the frequency of such patterns. Another point concerns the regulation of the normalization factors, which have different effects on either the normalization of C or that of L factors introduced with the ps factor equation. (9) Since the earlier normalization directly affects C, its effect is delayed on the time scale given by the result."}, {"heading": "5.5 Update rule", "text": "We may also introduce a rule of revision for the restructuring of the MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-MTX-M"}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgement", "text": "D thanks for the hospitality at the Max Planck Institute and for helpful discussions with Nihat Ay and Keyan Zahedi.

the accelerated development of robot technologies, optimal control becomes one of the central themes of research. In traditional approaches, the controller, by its internal functionality, finds appropriate actions on the basis of the history of sensor values, guided by the goals, intentions, objectives, learning schemes, and so on planted into it. The idea is that the controller controls the world\u2014the body plus its environment\u2014as reliably as possible. However, in elastically actuated robots this approach faces severe difficulties. This paper advocates for a new paradigm of self-organized control. The paper presents a solution with a controller that is devoid of any functionalities of its own, given by a fixed, explicit and context-free function of the recent history of the sensor values. When applying this controller to a muscletendon driven arm-shoulder system from the Myorobotics toolkit, we observe a vast variety of self-organized behavior patterns: when left alone, the arm realizes pseudo-random sequences of different poses but one can also manipulate the system into definite motion patterns. But most interestingly, after attaching an object, the controller gets in a functional resonance with the object\u2019s internal dynamics: when given a half-filled bottle, the system spontaneously starts shaking the bottle so that maximum response from the dynamics of the water is being generated. After attaching a pendulum to the arm, the controller drives the pendulum into a circular mode. In this way, the robot discovers dynamical affordances of objects its body is interacting with. We also discuss perspectives for using this controller paradigm for intention driven behavior generation.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
