Considering a schedule for each time t-R, we define resource use for src = < x, y, r > as: us (src, t) = {r if s (x) \u2264 t < s (y) 0 otherwiseIntuitively, simple resource constraint encodes the fact that between the time s (x) and s (y) resource is consumed at the rate (r) per unit of time for positive (negative) r."}, {"heading": "3.3 Resource consistency", "text": "For a plan s, we define the net use of a resource at a given time.

Therefore, the purpose of this section is not to introduce a new approach, but to show that these algorithms can be expressed simply by means of TRN formulation. Let TC formulation (ATN) be a MIP formulation that has a solution if only TC (ATN). For some types of ATN, such a formulation cannot exist and in these cases MIP-based algorithm cannot be applied. The following MIP program has a solution if and only if the TRN is time consistent."}, {"heading": "4.3 Constraint Programming based algorithm", "text": "The bottom of the MIP approach is the fact that the ATN must have a MIP formulation (e.g. pSTN does not have one). In this section, we present a novel CP concept that addresses this concern, so the high level of the idea of the algorithm is fairly simple and is represented in the second line, which we iterate over all the permutations of the events. In line 3, we can use a resource-consistent function to check the consistency of the resource that only depends on the permutation selected. In line five, we use TC checker to determine whether the network is time consistent - implementation depends on the type of ATN and we assume that it is available."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 TRN over STN", "text": "To understand the performance of our novel CP algorithm, we used the proposed MIP approach as a starting point. We used Gurobi as the MIP solver. Both algorithms were used to determine the time-resource consistency for TRN over the simple temporary network. In the case of the MIP-based algorithm, we used all time constraints l \u2264 x \u2212 y \u2264 u, where l, b \u00b2 R and x \u2212, y \u00b2 E can be expressed as linear constraints, where x and y are continuous variables. In the case of the CP algorithm, we used Floyd-Warshall to determine the time consistency proposed in [Dechter et al., 1991]. Test cases were created using the following procedure: 1. Enter the number of events N \u2265 2, number of time constraints T \u2265 2, and number of resource constraints R \u2265 22. Create a random schedule of events N at intervals."}, {"heading": "5.2 TRN over pSTN", "text": "To demonstrate the expandability of our approach, we have implemented a version of the TRN network in which the underlying time network is a pSTN ([Fang et al., 2014]). pSTN expands the term STN. It defines STN-like events and edges as activated time points or free time constraints. It expands STN to include received time points determined by the environment. each received time point is defined by corresponding uncertain duration (uDn), which defines a probability distribution over the duration between an activated time and the received time. Due to this extension, the term consistency TC (ATN) becomes a probability calculation; instead of asking whether this pSTN is consistent, we ask whether this pSTN is compatible with the probability p?. Since pSTN is an extension of STN, it is an ATN. Given the choice of p, we can use probabilistic consistency TC as an ATN."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We introduced a novel CP algorithm for determining the time-resource consistency of a TRN and compared the MIP baseline. We demonstrated that our algorithm achieves superior performance for networks with a large number of time constraints and a small number of resource constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the CP algorithm is flexible and can support recently introduced probabilistic Simple Temporal Networks [Fang et al., 2014]."}], "references": [{"title": "Annals of operations Research", "author": ["Martin Bartusch", "Rolf H M\u00f6hring", "Franz J Radermacher.
