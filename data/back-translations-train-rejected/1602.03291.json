We, on the other hand, investigate the task recommendation problem, where we leverage both implicit feedback and explicit features of the task. We assume that we are given a set of workers, a set of tasks, interactions (such as the number of times a worker has completed a particular task), and the presence of explicit features of each task (such as, task location). We intend to recommend tasks to the workers by exploiting the implicit interactions, and the presence or absence of explicit features in the tasks. We formalize the problem as an optimization problem, propose two alternative problem formulations and respective solutions that exploit implicit feedback, explicit features, as well as similarity between the tasks. We compare the efficacy of our proposed solutions against multiple state-of-the-art techniques using two large scale real world datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 08:06:32 GMT  (178kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03291v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 05:13:51 GMT  (690kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03291v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["habibur rahman", "lucas joppa", "senjuti basu roy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.03291"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.03291.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Feature Based Task Recommendation in Crowdsourcing with Implicit Observations", "authors": ["Habibur Rahman", "Lucas Joppa", "Senjuti Basu Roy"], "emails": ["habibur.rahman@mavs.uta.edu", "ljoppa@microsoft.com", "senjutib@njit.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk or Crowdflower have recently gained immense popularity due to their elegant framework in which a client can do work for a large number of virtual workers for very low remuneration. A common problem in these platforms is that workers have to endure enormous latency to find suitable tasks, which leads to dissatisfaction and ultimately leads to abandonment of the platform. Task recommendation issues are explored in the crowdsourcing context, where the goal is to recommend a set of tasks to each worker so that these tasks are most suitable for the worker (Geiger et al. 2014; Yuen et al. 2012). In this work, we aim to use the worker task-fulfillment history (referred to as implicit feedback) and augment it with explicit task characteristics or features to recommend tasks to the worker. Our focus of the study is limited to citizen crowdsourcing applications, where the importance of other X."}, {"heading": "Methodologies", "text": "The question is whether the problem is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which is a problem which"}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "We searched through all the observations from 2012 and randomly selected a set of 5,000 workers for our experiments, resulting in 1767 tasks with a total of 2.5 million observations. We used 294 locations as task characteristics. Rating: We evaluate our methods using a hold-out test set. We randomly select 90% of our data as a training set and remain 10% as a test set that gives us the basic truth. All results are an average of three runs. Implemented baseline algorithms: i) Implicit ALS Neg: This algorithm is implemented in accordance with (Lin and others 2014). The algorithm uses an alternating method that takes into account the least square signals. If a worker has not completed a task, then the total number of times the task was completed by other users is considered the weight of the negative signals. ii) Feature-Based-g: We assume that the task will be solved."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "We are the first to treat the history of task completion as implicit observations and incorporate information about task characteristics into recommendations.
