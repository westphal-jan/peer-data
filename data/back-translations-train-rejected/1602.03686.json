We particularly discuss imaging learning in NLP, as our proposed method relies on Skip-gram [6] [9], a popular method for learning word representation. Mikolov et al. [6] [9] proposed Skip-gram, a simple neural network-based model that can learn multidimensional vectors that capture the relationships between words through training with massive amounts of text. The trained real vectors will or could have similar values for syntactically and semantically close words such as dog and cat, but unique values for words that are not.

[12] learned to represent medical terms by applying Skip-gram to various medical texts; they collected the medical text from PubMed, MerckManuals, Medscape and Wikipedia; De Vine et al. [13] learned the representations of UMLS concepts from free-text medical records and medical journal abstracts; the first edited the text to match the words to UMLS concepts; and then applied Skip-gram concepts to the representations of the concepts; more recently, Choi et al. [14] Skip-gram applied to structured health insurance records, where the data set of patient visit records together with diagnostic codes (ICD9), laboratory test results (LOINC) and drug use (NDC) consisted of efficient representations of medical concepts that partially overlap with our goal of improving the medical representations by refocusing on the medical representations."}, {"heading": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "In Figure 1, we provide a high-level overview of the steps we take to perform the HFD prediction. In the training phase, we first train medical concept vectors from the EHRdataset using Skip-gram. We then construct patient representation using the medical concept vectors. Patient representation is then used to train heart failure prediction models using various classifiers, namely logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron with a hidden layer (MLP), and K-nearest neighbors. In the prediction phase, we map a patient's medical records using tomedical concept vectors and generate patient vectors by aggregating the concept vectors. We then insert the patient vectors into the trained model, which in turn generates a score for heart failure."}, {"heading": "Medical Concept Representation Learning", "text": "In fact, it is as if it were a kind of 'iron' country, in which it is not a country, in which it is not a country, but a country, in which it is a country, but a country, in which it is a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country and a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country"}, {"heading": "Patient Representation Construction", "text": "One of the impressive features of Skip-gram in Mikolovet al.

We expect that the medical concept representations learned through Skip-gram will have similar properties, so that the concept vectors will support clinically significant vector additions. Then, an efficient representation of a patient will be as easy as converting all medical concepts in his medical history into medical concept vectors, and then combining all of these vectors to obtain a single representation vector, as shown in Figure 4.
