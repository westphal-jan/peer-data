The classification procedure can be operated directly on hyperspectral data or performed by using some features extracted from the corresponding hyperspectral signatures containing information like the signature's energy or shape. In this paper, we describe a technique that applies non-homogeneous hidden Markov chain (NHMC) models to hyperspectral signature classification. The basic idea is to use statistical models (such as NHMC) to characterize wavelet coefficients which capture the spectrum semantics (i.e., structural information) at multiple levels. Experimental results show that the approach based on NHMC models can outperform existing approaches relevant in classification tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 21:25:36 GMT  (683kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03903v1", "23 pages, 8 figures, preprint, first published online on April 28 2015"], ["v2", "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 19:50:27 GMT  (862kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03903v2", "21 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, preprint, revised April 8 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages, 8 figures, preprint, first published online on April 28 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["siwei feng", "yuki itoh", "mario parente", "marco f duarte"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.03903"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.03903.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Wavelet-Based Semantic Features for Hyperspectral Signature Discrimination", "authors": ["Siwei Feng", "Yuki Itoh", "Mario Parente", "Marco F.

Wavelet Analysis", "text": "The waveform of a signal provides a multi-scale analysis of the signal content that effectively encodes the locations and scales on which the signal structure is present in a compact manner [16]. To date, several hyspectral classification methods based on wave transformation have been proposed, and most of these classification approaches (e.g. [8], [17], [18]) use dyadic / decimalized wave transformation (DWT) as a pre-processing step. Compared to UWT, DWT provides a more precise representation because it minimizes the amount of redundancy in the coefficients. However, the compromise for such redundancy is that UWT provides maximum flexibility in the choice of scales and offsets used in multi-scale analysis, which allows easy characterization of the spectral structure at each spectral bandwidth."}, {"heading": "C. Advantages of Haar Wavelet", "text": "The Hair Wave System is the simplest compact wave system possible, with the characteristics of square shape and discontinuity, which make the Hair Wave System sensitive to a wider range of fluctuations than other mother-wave systems and provide it with a lower discriminatory force. Thus, the Hair Wave System allows the detection of both slow fluctuations and sudden changes in a signal [16], while the numbers in the middle and bottom of the spectrum show the undecimated wavelength matrix of the spectrum below the Hair and Daubechies 4 wavelengths show that these wavelengths fluctuate very quickly in the middle of the spectrum and that the wavelengths in the middle of the spectrum fluctuate very strongly. The mean number in Figure 1 shows the ability of the hair wavelengths to detect both rapid changes and slightly decreasing fluctuations in the sample."}, {"heading": "D. Statistical Modeling of Wavelet Coefficients", "text": "Crouse et al. [11] proposed the use of hidden Markov models (HMM) to gather DWT coefficient statistics (= 1).In this paper, the dyadic nature of DWT coefficients is used as the basis for a hidden Markov tree (HMT) model that characterizes the cluster and persistence properties of wavelength coefficients.6 The statistical model is based on the wavelength representation of spectra in a training library.6 The statistical model is motivated by DWT's compression property, which states that the wavelength transform of a piecewise smooth signal generally exhibits a small number of large coefficients and a large number of small coefficients. This property motivates the use of a zero-mean-Gaussian mixing model (GMM) with two Gaussian components to capture the compression characteristics, \"characterizing a large number of Gaussian coefficients.\""}, {"heading": "E. Wavelet-based Spectral Matching", "text": "Many hyperspectral signature classification approaches have been proposed in the literature, a subset of which includes wavelength series analysis [6], [7], [22], [23]. In this paper, we review two approaches that are particularly close to our proposed method, which are used for comparison in our numerical experiments. Since our focus in this paper is on the hyperspectral classification of individual pixels, we limit our comparison to methods that rely exclusively on the spectrum of a particular pixel or on properties derived from the spectra of the pixel. More specifically, we do not compare with other methods that use additional information (e.g. spatial information for an HSI) or that rely on prior knowledge of the location of semantic information normally obtained by an expert. First, Rivard et al. [6] propose a method based on the wavelength decomposition of the spectral data."}, {"heading": "III. NHMC-BASED FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION", "text": "In this section, we present a feature extraction scheme for hyperspectral signatures that uses a Markov model for the wavelet coefficients of the signature.

Multi-State Hidden Markov Chain Model", "text": "In our system, we choose to use the NHMC model described in section II-D, which is applied to the UWT across the wavelength spectrum. We select the hair wavelength system because of its special shape, which makes the size of the wavelength coefficient proportional to the inclination of the spectra across the wavelength support. Furthermore, the signs of these coefficients are indicative of the inclination orientation (increasing or decreasing for negative or positive). In contrast to the previous work [11], we design our NHMC as characteristics of the k-state GMM for the wavelength coefficient. We increase the number of states from 2 to k > 2, because a two-state mean GMM makes an excessively rough distinction between sharper absorption bands (fluctuations) and flatter regions in a hyperspectral signature, which are normally assigned to large or small states."}, {"heading": "B.

Additional Modifications to NHMC", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "E. Classification System Overview", "text": "We give an overview of the NHMC-based hyperspectral classification system in Fig. 5. The system consists of two modules: an NHMC training module and a classification module. While the figure is based on a binary Gaussian mixing model (GMM) described in Section II-D in the NHMC, it is easy to formulate a k-ary GMM state variant, k = 2, 3,..., as in Section III. The training level uses a training library of spectra containing samples from the classes in question to train the NHMC model, which is then used to calculate condition estimates for each of the training spectra using a Viterbi algorithm. The condition fields obtained from the NHMC model are then used as classification characteristics, coupled with a classification scheme, e.g. the nearest model (NN) or the support of the vector machine (SVM test module), the classification is then calculated using the school class selected and the HM during use."}, {"heading": "IV. CLASSIFICATION EXPERIMENTS AND RESULT ANALYSIS", "text": "In this section, we present several experimental results that evaluate the performance of the proposed characteristics in the classification of the hyperspectral signature.

NHMC Parameters", "text": "Next, we evaluate the effect of the number of states contained in the NHMC model on the performance of the tested classifiers. We set the DMP at 85% for accuracy and evaluate the classification performance of all proposed NHMC features with NN and SVM classifiers as a function of the number of states that fluctuates between 2 and 10 for GMM and between 3 and 10 for MOG. Fig. 7 shows the tendency to vary the classification accuracy with increasing numbers of mixed Gaussian components using different classifiers and similarity metrics. These four numbers show that MOG with additional wave coefficient marks provides relatively consistent performance compared to other NHMC-based models. In addition, the two model configurations with MOG offer two power extremes in terms of classification accuracy: by adding wave coefficient marks, we observe the highest classification performance, while MOG without signs provides the lowest nitrate."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed the design of a feature extraction scheme for hyperspectral signatures that preserves the semantic information used by practitioners in signature discrimination (i.e., the location of the distinction between fluctuations and discontinuities).However, our approach is automated by the use of statistical models of wave motion that concisely capture the location and size of fluctuations in the observed spectra. Furthermore, the 20er model allows spectra to be segmented into informative and non-informative portions. The success of statistical modeling is largely dependent on the availability of a large-scale database for training with representative examples observed by the sensor system."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "We would like to thank Mr. Ping Fung for the efficient implementation of our NHMC training code, which has considerably reduced the time of conducting experiments."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A", "text": "PROOF LEMMA 1By applying ps, S \u2192 Za \u2192 b = p (Zs = b | Ss = a) and the law of total probability, we can obtain p (Zs = b) = \u2211 a p s, S \u2192 Z a \u2192 b p (Ss = a).

The classification procedure can be operated directly on hyperspectral data or performed by using some features extracted from the corresponding hyperspectral signatures containing information like the signature\u2019s energy or shape. In this paper, we describe a technique that applies non-homogeneous hidden Markov chain (NHMC) models to hyperspectral signature classification. The basic idea is to use statistical models (such as NHMC) to characterize wavelet coefficients which capture the spectrum semantics (i.e., structural information) at multiple levels. Experimental results show that the approach based on NHMC models can outperform existing approaches relevant in classification tasks.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
