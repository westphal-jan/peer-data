Job parameters (a) Deadline: The clock starts ticking for a job as soon as it arrives. We use D to name the deadline. D for each job is a limit for the duration, starting with the arrival of the job before which the job must be completed in expectation.

If the means (\u03c1i and \u03b2i) are known to the applicant, no practicable allocation xi to the employee should exceed i D / \u03c1i. The additional requirement for accuracy requires that the probability of an employee failing in the duration \u03c1ixi is not higher than \u03b5. This corresponds to the limitation Fi (\u03c1ixi) \u2264 \u03b5, where Fi is the CDF of the random variable TTF of the employee i, which we model as an exponential distribution with the mean \u03b2i. To simplify, the optimization problem of the applicant is reduced to eq.

Therefore, each assignment contributes such a sample to the Robust UCB Algorithm which estimates the probability. To deal with this difficulty, we suggest using a random variable. Consider the experiment in which a worker i is assigned a task (fraction of a job) for which the worker is assigned a duration of at least one year. If the worker i fails in the first duration of the assignment, the random variable is considered a success. Consider the experiment in which a worker is assigned a task (fraction of a job)."}, {"heading": "4.2 SW-GREEDY: A Greedy Allocation", "text": "Employees are indexed in an increasing order of their costs, and each employee is assigned the largest possible share that does not violate the restrictions in eq.

We refer to the externality imposed by the agent i on j as xEXTi, j (bi, b \u2212 i; ht, t), which is the additional share of the agent j in the absence of the agent i. The externality for work t depends on the offer profile (bi, b \u2212 i) and the history of allocations to work.

In practice, the constants that relate to the same are unknown. Also, our algorithm focuses on optimizing social welfare. However, the payments to the workers include externality for the workers that depend on the UCB Robust Learning Scheme. The learning scheme does not provide guarantees for the stochastic parameters for the suboptimal workers, but the payments to the optimal workers can also include these parameters of the suboptimal workers.Therefore, the simulations help us to form a fair idea about the same. Therefore, in order to investigate the effectiveness of our algorithm in practical terms, we tested our method on synthetically generated data sets. We simulated a number of 400 different workers with different costs, production times and error rates. We set the following values: B = 50, \u03b2 = 50, \u03b2 = 25, \u03b2 = 35, c = 10 and c = 100."}, {"heading": "8 Future Work", "text": "It would be interesting to see how these learned values affect remuneration. b) Examining the use of other models for the JCT and TTF.

Such models would pose further challenges to learning due to the interdependence between the stochastic parameters. c) In formulating the problem in equivalence.
