At this level, a document (more accurately, a comment) was represented by its citation vector, which represented which references were cited and how often they were cited in a particular document. For example, there were a total of 61 different references represented by the essays of authors W, B, G and T. These indices were then encoded in 1, 2,.. 61 using the following approach. The earlier the author name appears in the alphabet, and the earlier the citations were, the smaller the index. Fig. 2 shows the citation vector of [5]. The bar height in Fig. 2 represents the citation frequency of a reference topic [5]. This citation vector can therefore be used to represent the \"parent document\" document that it generates. Topic Level. Although the above citation vector can be used as a mass spectrometer to represent the distribution of some basic features of a document, they were insufficient."}, {"heading": "3.

A topic process model", "text": "This section describes a proposed topic process model that has been used to gain further insights into RRW in scholarly commentary publications. As shown in Fig.3, the topics in the main body of the issue paper are processed in addition to the topics contained in the background knowledge.In the topic process model, the author is assumed to process the input paper with background knowledge in the following ways. This ultimately leads to a change in the weighting of the topics based on the background knowledge component (Bk), with a variation: a function of the product of the input component (Ik) and (Bk), as shown in (1).This results in the output component (Ok).Ok = Bk + f (Bk \u00b7 Ik). (1) Equation (1) was motivated in part by the Hebrew learning model, in which the weight of a connection between two neurons is proportional to the product of the signal strengths of the two. This equation is also intuitive, that the interaction between the reader (1) and the knowledge has been applied."}, {"heading": "3.2.

Discussion", "text": "The above results illustrate how the input paper and the background knowledge are involved in the design of the output paper. This parameter can only be used for this specific input, and it cannot be generalized to other cases (e.g. posting on Twitter).

Conclusion", "text": "The relationship between reading and writing was examined using a specific scenario: academic commentary. This scenario was chosen to explore RRW behaviors in general because it offered a unique advantage in reducing the difficulty of obtaining accurate background knowledge, and because it was believed that the implications of this environment could shed light on RRW behaviors in general.The academic commentary material for this study was divided into three parts: the target article that the commentary comments on, the comment article itself, and the quotations from the commentary arararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararar"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The authors would like to thank Prof. Mark Steyvers for his generous recommendation on SCVB0 when they met at the Seoul National University, Korea, in October 2014 at APCCBS.
