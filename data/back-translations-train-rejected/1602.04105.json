O\u2019Shea", "Johnathan Corgan"], "emails": ["OSHEA@VT.EDU", "JOHNATHAN@CORGANLABS.COM"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "Radio communication is a unique area of signal processing that presents a number of interesting challenges and opportunities for the machine learning community. It is an area in which expert functions and decision-making criteria under certain criteria have been extensively developed, analyzed and discussed in certain areas for many years. In recent years, the trend in machine learning, especially in image processing (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and speech recognition (Sainath et al., 2015), has been predominantly that of feature learning from data.At the same time, the requirements for radio technologies, operators and regulatory authorities to increase the efficiency, adaptability and flexibility with which devices within the same spectrum can access, understand and interact are important tasks that are related to the environment of radio (Mituola III & Maguire Jr., 1999), the opportunistic access and sharing of frequencies and \"cognitive radio\" (CR) are widely discussed."}, {"heading": "2. Modulation Recognition", "text": "In Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), one of the most important tasks performed by frequency users is to provide sufficient awareness of their environment to avoid the creation or damage from radio interference with other users, including the ability to identify random radio, local and wide-angle data and voice radios, radar users and other sources or protected classes of potential radio interference in the environment. Modulation Recognition is generally this task of identifying based on a noisy received radio signal at a given time, what type of communication scheme is currently used and thus what type of spectrum users are present that cause interference or need to be protected from interference. The problem is then estimating a class of communication signals from a received radio time series that is typically represented as a complex base band time series signal in a digitally sampled receiver."}, {"heading": "2.1. Expert Cyclic-Moment Features", "text": "Integrated cyclic moment-based characteristics (Gardner & Spooner, 1992) are currently widely used in modulation detection and in the creation of analytically derived decision trees for sorting modulations into different classes. Generally, they take the form given in the equation 3.snm = fm (x n (t)... xn (t + T). (3) By calculating the m'th order statistics on then'th power of the momentary or time-delayed receive signal r (t), we can obtain a set of statistics that uniquely separate it from other modulations in a decision-making process on the characteristics. In our comparison, we calculate the first two moments of the first 4 powers of the complex receive signal, the received signal envelope, the complex signal phase, and the envelope of the received signal phase."}, {"heading": "2.2. Convolutional Feature Learning", "text": "Since automatic differentiation and complex neural networks as a whole are still a field of development, we decide to treat samples from r (t) as t-2xN vectors for input into a narrow 2D-convolutionary network, in which the orthogonal and synchronously sampled inphase and quadrature samples (I & Q) constitute the 2-wide dimension."}, {"heading": "3. Evaluation Dataset", "text": "While simulation and the use of synthetic data sets for learning in machine learning are generally frowned upon, radio communication is something of a special case. Certainly, training with real data is important and valuable - and we will deal with it more in the future - but there are certain characteristics that allow us to call this approach to real data reasonable. Radio communication signals are generated synthetically, and we can do so in a deterministic manner that is identical to a real system, introducing modulation, pulse shaping, worn data, and other well-characterized transmission parameters that are identical to a real-world signal. We modulate real speech and text data onto the signal. In the case of digital modulation, we edit the data with a block randomizer to create an independent random distribution among the bits.Channel effects are relatively well characterized. Here, we have to make simplistic assumptions, but we use robust and more accurate driving models for multiple-time variations."}, {"heading": "3.1. Dataset Availability", "text": "We plan to make this dataset available both through the generative simulation model and the parameters required to reproduce the dataset, and as a Python pickle file that stores a fixed training and test set consisting of time-shifted examples and corresponding modulation classes. We hope that the scope of the modulations addressed, the realism of the channel models applied, and the relevance of the signals that will be considered purely machine learning problems in the coming years will increase."}, {"heading": "3.2. Dataset Parameters", "text": "We focus on a data set consisting of 11 modulations: 8 digital and 3 analog modulations, all of which are widely used in everyday wireless communication systems around us. These consist of BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, BFSK, CPFSK and PAM4 for digital modulation and WB-FM, AM-SSB and AM-DSB for analog modulation. Data is modulated at a rate of approximately 8 samples per symbol with a standardized average transmission power of 0dB."}, {"heading": "3.3. Dataset Plots", "text": "Looking at a single example of each class of signal in the time domain, one sees a number of similarities and differences between the types of modulation, but due to the use of a pulse-forming signal they are not immediately recognizable to a human skilled person. If one looks at the signal strength of each of these signals in the frequency domain, one can see that many of the signals follow a similar shell constructively and are not easily recognisable to a human expert."}, {"heading": "3.4. Modulated Information", "text": "In radio communications, signals typically consist of a number of modulated data nites on well-defined and understood basic functions into discrete modes formed by these bases. By manipulating the frequency, amplitude, phase, or sum thereof, data bits into this space are modulated by discrete and divisible modes for each individual symbol period in time in the case of digital or continuous position in the case of analog modulation. In the case of QPSK, this phase mapping is then typically applied in 4.s (ti) = e j2\u03c0fct + \u03c02ci + 14, ci-0, 1, 2, 3 (4) pulse forming filters such as root radiofrequency cosine to limit the signal in frequency and remove sharp broadband transients between these different modes, resulting in a mixture of 35 adjacent data elements in the digital database."}, {"heading": "3.5. Effects on the Modulated Signal", "text": "Channel effects, on the other hand, are not deterministic and cannot be completely inverted in a communication system. Real systems experience a series of effects on the transmitted signal that make it difficult to restore and render it. Thermal noise results in a relatively flat white Gaussian noise at the receiver, which forms a noise floor or sensitivity level and a signal-to-noise ratio. Oscillator flow due to temperature and other semiconductor physics that differ from transmitter and receiver results in symbol time offset, sample rate offset, carrier frequency offset and phase difference. These effects result in a time shift, scaling, linear mixing / rotation between channels, and a rotation of the received signal based on infinite time-varying processes. Finally, real channels are subject to random filtering based on the incoming modes of the transmitted signal at the receiver with different amplitude, phase, quadruple, and delay, which is commonly known as the multifading phenomenon occurring in buildings."}, {"heading": "3.6. Generating a dataset", "text": "To generate a well-characterized dataset, we select a collection of modulations that are widely used in practice, operating on both discrete binary alphabets (digital modulations) and continuous alphabets (analog modulations). We modulate known data about each modem and expose them to each of the channel effects described above using GNU Radio. We segment the millions of samples into a dataset that consists of numerous short-term windows, similar to how a continuous acoustic speech signal is typically used for speech recognition tasks. We extract steps from 128 samples with a shift of 64 samples to form our extracted datasets. After segmentation, the examples are about 128 microseconds, each assuming a sampling rate of about 1 MSamp / sec. Each contains between 8 and 16 symbols with random time offset, scaling, rotation, phase effects, channel response, and noise information as they were transmitted to the data pattern, while the samples were modulated through the data pattern and the data response."}, {"heading": "4. Technical Approach", "text": "In a wireless communication system, a class of receivers commonly considered to be \"matched filter\" receivers is located on the receiving side of a communication connection, with filters developed by experts linked to the incoming time signal with each transferred symbol representation, and peaks when the correct symbol slides over the correct symbol time of the received signal. By calculating the impulsive noise in the receiver, we attempt to optimize the signal to noise. Typically, before this turn stage, symbol timing and carrier frequency are restored using an expert shell or moment-based estimators derived analytically for a particular modulation and channel model. The intuition behind using a conventional neural network in this application is that they learn to form suitable filters for numerous temporal features, each of which has a certain filter gain to operate at a lower SNR, and together form the robust basis for classification."}, {"heading": "4.1. Learning Invariance", "text": "Many of these restoration processes in radio communication systems can be considered as invariances to linear mixing, rotation, time shift, scaling, and folding by random filters (with well-characterized probable envelopes and coherence times), analogous to similar learning invariances that are strongly addressed in visual learning, where coordinated filters for specific objects or features in the image can go through scales, shifts, rotations, occlusions, light variations, and other forms of noise. We are trying to use the shift-invariant properties of the Convolutionary Neural Network to learn coordinated filters that can na\u00efvely outline features of symbol coding without experts understanding or appreciating the underlying waveform."}, {"heading": "4.2. Evaluation Network", "text": "We train against a 4-layer neural network, using two revolutionary layers and two dense, fully connected layers; we use a linear activation function for the first three layers and a softmax activation for the last to select the output class; regularization is used to prevent overadjustment by adding a standard penalty for the revolutionary layer weights, promoting minimal energy bases, and introducing a standard penalty for the first activation of the dense layer to promote the scarcity of solutions (Lee et al., 2006) (Zeiler et al., 2010); dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) is used to prevent over-specialization of network units; and training is performed using a categorical cross-entropy loss function; we use the Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) solver for optimization, an efficient dynamic form of stoic gradient descent learning, and chimplementation (2015)."}, {"heading": "4.3. Training Complexity", "text": "We train our model for about 9 minutes and perform 24 epochs for Adam-SGD across the full spectrum of approximately 900,000 samples in batch sizes of 1024 for 24 epochs, each lasting about 22 seconds. We observe some overfits on the training set beyond 13 epochs, but the validation loss does not suffer significantly and performance at higher SNR appears to improve when we consider loss versus SNR separately. Our training loss curves are shown in Figure 4."}, {"heading": "4.4. Learned Features", "text": "In Figure 5, the first layer, we have 64 1x3 filters. In this case, we simply obtain a set of 1D edge and gradient detectors that operate via the I and Q channels. In Figure 2, we combine the weights of the first layer shown in Figure 6 into 64 * 16x2x3 slightly larger feature cards that include what happens on each adjacent I and Q channels and what happens immediately before and after each sample in time. These feature cards are not much different from those seen on the lower levels of a conv network of learned 2D edge detectors and gabor-like filters."}, {"heading": "5. Results", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to be able to look for a suitable partner who will be able to achieve our objectives."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "Although these results should not constitute a comprehensive comparison of existing best-case expert characteristics of modulation classifiers, they show that blind revolutionary networks based on time series data are a viable and attractive alternative method. In Figure 7, we demonstrate a significant accuracy of the SNR classification advantage of this classification system and believe that for such short data examples (128 complex samples), this represents a powerful and state-of-the-art precision modulation capability that has the potential to adapt beyond the 11 tested here and to learn numerous other modulation modes. This method should be considered a strong candidate for DSA and CR systems based on a robust low SNR classification of radio emitters."}, {"heading": "7. Future Work", "text": "Our results are comparable to a reasonable approximation of the current best expert approach, but since there are no robust competitive datasets in the emerging field of radio machine learning, it is difficult to compare performance directly with the current state of the art. In future work, we hope to be able to more robustly compare state-of-the-art expert functionality systems with non-instantaneous cyclic accumulators in addition to the zero-delay accumulators evaluated in this work. Further refinements are [inevitable] possible to the ConvNet network architecture, as we invested some effort in trying to optimize the network structure, regulation, and other learning parameters, but did not fully do so. Larger filters or otherwise arranged filters together with different pooling layer strategies can significantly affect performance, but have not been fully investigated for their suitability. Numerous additional techniques could be applied to the problem, including the introduction of additional channel drive invariance, as well as other dilemma imbalances, such as I / Q."}], "references": [{"title": "TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning", "author": ["Fernanda", "Vinyals", "Oriol", "Warden", "Pete", "Wattenberg", "Martin", "Wicke", "Yu", "Yuan", "Zheng", "Xiaoqiang"], "venue": "on heterogeneous systems,", "citeRegEx": "Fernanda et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Fernanda et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Applications of machine learning to cognitive radio networks", "author": ["Clancy", "Charles", "Hecker", "Joe", "Stuntebeck", "Erich", "O\u2019Shea", "Tim"], "venue": "Wireless Communications,", "citeRegEx": "Clancy et al\\.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Clancy et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Signal interception: performance advantages of cyclic-feature detectors", "author": ["Gardner", "William A", "Spooner", "Chad M"], "venue": "Communications, IEEE Transactions on,", "citeRegEx": "Gardner et al\\.,? \\Q1992\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gardner et al\\.", "year": 1992}, {"title": "Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks", "author": ["Graves", "Alex", "Mohamed", "Abdel-rahman", "Hinton", "Geoffrey E"], "venue": "CoRR, abs/1303.5778,", "citeRegEx": "Graves et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Graves et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Spatial transformer networks", "author": ["Jaderberg", "Max", "Simonyan", "Karen", "Zisserman", "Andrew", "Kavukcuoglu", "Koray"], "venue": "CoRR, abs/1506.02025,", "citeRegEx": "Jaderberg et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Jaderberg et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Cyclostationary approaches to signal detection and classification in cognitive radio.
