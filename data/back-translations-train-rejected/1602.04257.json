INTRODUCTIONA Survey, conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), found that in 2011, more than 3.3 million patients in the United States were readmitted within 30 days of their discharge. Need for readmission indicates that insufficient care was provided to the patient at the time of initial admission. Inadequate care poses a threat to the lives and treatment of patients leading to higher healthcare costs. Over $41 billion has been spent on treating recurring patients."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "Numerous previous studies have analyzed the risk factors predicting reuptake rates in diabetics [3], [7], [8], [16], [20], [22], [25] of which important ones have been discussed here. [24] Acute and chronic glycemic control was found to affect reuptake risk in a dataset of more than 29,000 patients over 65 years of age.

[25] Investigated demographic and socio-economic factors influencing reuptake rates are better than the effects of HbA1c on reuptake outcomes."}, {"heading": "III. METHODOLOGY", "text": "A dataset of 101,765 diabetes records collected over a 10-year period (1999-2008) from 130 hospitals in the United States was used for all analyses presented in this paper [22], [25]. Each patient's medical records contained 50 potential risk factors and a label indicating whether the patient was admitted within 30 days, 30 days, or never resumed. Distribution is as follows: 11% of patients were resumed within 30 days, 35% after 30 days, and 54% patients were never resumed. An overview of our methodology is provided in Figure 1. We initially process the data using the methodology described in Section 3.A. From these preprocessed data, we build models to predict resum\u00e9 rates (Classification, Section 3.B) and identify groups of features that are important for predicting resum\u00e9 rates (Feature Analysis, Section 3.C), which in turn reveal critical risk factors."}, {"heading": "A. Risk Factors", "text": "Prior to each analysis, we processed the data in the following ways: the primary, secondary and tertiary medical diagnoses were indicated by the ICD9 codes [26]; each ICD9 indicates a unique diagnostic condition; the ICD9 codes recorded more than 1,000 unique values; for many diagnostic conditions (ICD9 codes), data was available for only a few patients; and determining the effect of each of these diagnostic conditions on readmission rates was not feasible. Consequently, we grouped ICD9 codes, which were represented in a total of 10 groups [26]. Grouping was not performed; each of these ICD 9 codes was available in smaller quantities."}, {"heading": "B. Classification", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "C. Feature Analysis", "text": "The following are two methods of performing the feature analysis to identify critical risk factors.1) Ablation study of risk factors: The importance of individual risk factors can be assessed by conducting an ablation study. An ablation study involves removing one factor after another and comparing the accuracy of predicting risk factors with the accuracy achieved by taking all features into account. Intuitively, removing more important features should lead to a greater decrease in accuracy. Ablation of risk factors was performed to assess the importance of each of these factors. 2) Associative Rule Mining (ARM): In addition to predictive modelling of the main topic, risk factors should be identified and help medical practitioners gain more knowledge."}, {"heading": "D. Evaluation Criteria", "text": "A system for predicting high-risk patients only makes sense if a large proportion of high-risk patients are correctly identified (i.e. high recall) without generating a large number of false alarms (i.e. high precision). Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) is omnipresent as one of the best indicators for evaluating classification models, and the research paper [5] clearly demonstrates that there is a deep link between ROC space and Precision Recall (PR) space, so that a curve dominates in the ROC space when it dominates in the PR space."}, {"heading": "E. Cost Sensitive Analysis", "text": "The model must be aligned to maximize the costs that the hospital will save by using the analysis model, which can be done by selecting an appropriate threshold for machine learning algorithms. Let \u03b1 be the cost per recovery, and \u03b2 be the cost per Special Diagnosis for patients predicted to be Yes (< 30 or > 30 days of recovery). Let the patient define instances of the test kit based on the cost matrix. Cost matrix is one in which the cost or penalty of classification for each element is specified as in the confusion matrix of special diagnoses. CostMatrix = [TP FN FP TN TN TN TN] (3) Where TP, FN and TN prediction models correspond to true positives, false positives, false negatives and true negatives respectively. Without the prediction model: All cases in which patients are actually admitted again (true positives and false negatives) will incur costs."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS", "text": "This section contains the results of caries experiments as described in Section 3. The effectiveness of different classifiers to predict readmission status was discussed in Section 4.A. Section 4.B describes critical risk factors identified by feature analyses using two methods, the ablation study and the Association Rule Mining. Finally, the results of cost-effective analyses are discussed in Section 4.C."}, {"heading": "A. Analysis of Classifiers", "text": "It is time for EU member states to set out to find a solution that paves the way to the European Union."}, {"heading": "C. Cost Analysis", "text": "The cost analysis was carried out as explained in Section 3.E. The article [15] states that the cost of resuming diabetes mellitus and its complications at 23,700 resumes is approximately $251 million. Consequently, the cost per resuming \u03b1 is approximately $10,591 ($250,000, 000 / 23,300). In our research, a specific diagnosis is considered as an additional admission day on which the physician can perform another diagnosis that could lead to the discovery of new complications in the patient. Therefore, the cost of a specific diagnosis is considered as the cost per day of admission to the hospital. Our data set indicates that the average time in hospital for diabetic patients is 4,396 days. Therefore, the cost of a day admission is considered $2,409 ($10,591 / 4,396)."}, {"heading": "V.
