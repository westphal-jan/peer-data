Introduction.", "text": "Data warehouses (DW) are used to collect and store large amounts of data in large tables, which are then processed, helping to extract knowledge and help in decision-making. DW collects the data stored from heterogeneous sources and creates centralized huge databases, initially identifying hidden patterns that have been treated once. In (W. INMON, 1994), the authors present these large data structures and their architecture as the result of data collection from centralized, initially decentralized databases, which they can homogenize and provide the ability to handle multidimensional data structures called OLAP cubes. (L.Lebart, A.Morineau, M.Piron, 2006) consider multidimensional statics as an interesting analytical axis that should be investigated. Random compilation of data and its arrangement in the DW may contain unnecessary and superfluous data that have no real interest for the analyst and even provide erroneous results when included in processing."}, {"heading": "2.

Proposed Approach for Data Warehouse Reduction.", "text": "In our approach, we propose a method for reducing the number of dimensions p 2. 2. with the AGs and the MCA. We try to identify a subset p 'of the dimensions in which p' < p, in which we can find the next elements for reference. Each individual returned by the GA represents a subset of dimensions and is considered a possible solution. Each solution is represented by a chromosome that contains as many genes as the DW dimensions. Each gene has two possible values: 1 if we hold the corresponding dimension in the solution and 0 otherwise. We then calculate for each solution the distance between the individual facts contained in the extracted sample and each fact. We then consider the minimum value of the distances we choose when calculating the sum of all d-positions that we would not be able to identify the facts with minimum values and that are close to the reference. The approach is based on the similarity between two individuals profile."}, {"heading": "5.
