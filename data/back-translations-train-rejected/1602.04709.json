The main difficulty remains the inability to turn such contributions into pragmatic processes the pharmaceutical industry can leverage in order to generate insight from social media data, which can be considered as one of the most challenging source of information available today due to its sheer volume and noise. This study is based on the work by Scott Spangler and Jeffrey Kreulen and applies it to identify structure in social media through the extraction of a topical taxonomy able to capture the latent knowledge in social conversations in health-related sites. The mechanism for automatically identifying and generating a taxonomy from social conversations is developed and pressured tested using public data from media sites focused on the needs of cancer patients and their families. Moreover, a novel method for generating the category's label and the determination of an optimal number of categories is presented which extends Scott and Jeffrey's research in a meaningful way.

Methodology", "text": "Without taking into account the types of taxonomy, one has to focus on the relationships and the fact that they contain different types of relationships between terms. The basic building blocks in each taxonomy remain the terms; therefore, the first step to identify such a group of concepts.It turns out that the cluster algorithms have a proven record in terms identification; it is no coincidence that this was the method of choice for spanglers and creatures. Consequently, we used the same k-Means algorithms as a starting point to create a baseline that could be further improved with the use of other clusters."}, {"heading": "3.1 Source of data", "text": "In this study, we searched conversations from social sites that do not require login, and with open access to their forums. Specifically, we collected data from the following sites: www.cancerforums.net, www.lunglovelink.org, and www.lungevity.org. Among the forums that were available for browsing, we collected social posts on \"Small Cell Lung Cancer\" using an in-house crawler developed using Python, based on the open source Beautiful Soup, and stored the social data in the form of XML documents with a canonical structure independent of a particular site. Upon completion of the search, the XML data was converted into a comma-separated file for further processing, and the final dataset contained a total of posts with the breakdown shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "3.2 Extracting and preparing the data", "text": "The data mining tool used in this experiment is RapidMiner with the addition of the TextMining addon, which is freely available and downloadable within the tool itself. The process of word preprocessing in social posts is described in Figure 2.As described in any text mining preprocessing task, we started the process by transforming the social conversations into the well-known vector spatial model by using the \"process document\" operator in RapidMiner with TF-IDF measurements of frequency. We first used tokens, a word processing method that separates text into a sequence of tokens (single words), using the spaces between the words and removing any punctuation www.ijera.com 23 | P a g echaracter. Next, we transformed the tokens to include all lowercase letters so that the word frequency for these conversations can be taken into account. Social conversations represent terms associated with the use of many noisy words."}, {"heading": "3.3 k-Means clustering", "text": "Organizing data into meaningful categories is a fundamental task in generating a taxonomy, and many approaches exist today. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods for grouping objects based on similar characteristics to examine their intrinsic structure. Cluster methods, however, do not produce labels, and this shortcoming was addressed in this study. The k-Means cluster algorithm was proposed over 50 years ago and is still widely used today, although many other algorithms have been proposed since its introduction [9]. Since our study is based on the work of Spangler and Kreulen [1], we will apply the same approach that uses the k-Means algorithm."}, {"heading": "3.4 Determining the number of categories", "text": "The application of the k-Means cluster algorithm requires the user to indicate the initial number of categories that are probably not known a priori. In this particular case, the help of a professional cannot provide useful insight into the number of categories included in the social conversations. In general, we can limit the generation of no more than 30 categories to a good cause. Before doing this, we must define a score that can measure the quality of a cluster solution to determine when one solution is better than another. In general, we can characterize a \"good solution\" as a set of clusters that are far apart from each other."}, {"heading": "3.5 Extraction of the taxonomy", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to be able to live in a country where most people are able to move to another world, where they are able to live, where they are able to live, and where they are able to change the world they live in."}], "references": [{"title": "Mining the Talk: Unlocking the Business Value in Unstructured Information (Boston", "author": ["S.
