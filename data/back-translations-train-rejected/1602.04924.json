OVERALL APPROACH", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Problem Statement and Overall Framework", "text": "Given a pair (query, search engine), our task is to select a primary vertical and a series of secondary verticals from a list of all possible vertical areas, including persons (members), workplaces, companies, occupations, member posts, slideshows, etc., and then classify the primary individual results and the secondary vertical blocks into a single ranking, as shown in Figure 1, without changing the order in the primary vertical. The reason for this limitation is twofold. First, we believe that the base rank of each vertical is the best to classify the results within its domain. Second, this ensures that the membership experience remains consistent between federative search and vertical search. The overall frame is described in Figure 2. If a member submits a query q, the query is forwarded to verticals and triggers the corresponding vertical search engines to obtain the best K-for each vertical section to be selected as the top-to-to-to-to-to-to-the preliminary results in the vertical sections."}, {"heading": "2.2 Aggregation Algorithm", "text": "In this section we discuss how our aggregation algorithm works. Input into the algorithm includes results from the primary vertical P along with all secondary vertical clusters of candidates C and a federated vertical cluster fs. We go through each of the vertical primary results Pi and calculate the relevance value for this result using the vertical cluster of candidates (the second loop in algorithm 1). We compare this value with the relevance values of all secondary vertical clusters of candidates. If the former is higher, we select the primary vertical result for its position. On the other hand, if there is a secondary vertical cluster of candidates that has a higher relevance value than the primary result, we add the secondary vertical cluster of the aggregated ranking and proceed to the next primary result. We repeat this process until we position all primary results. Any secondary vertical results that are left over."}, {"heading": "2.3 Federated Scorer Training", "text": "Results must be vertically comparable (for preliminary vertical algorithms 1: Federated Search Aggregation AlgorithmInput: Individual results from primary vertical P Secondary vertical clusters C: Aggregated result list sortedSecondaryV erticals \u2192 []; rankList \u2192 [] for i = 1 to len (C) do / / data structure sorted based on fs (Ci) sortedSecondaryVerticals.add (Ci) end j (P) doif fs (Pi) > s (sortedSecondaryVerticals.get) do / / / / data structure sorted based on fs (Ci) sortedSecondaryVerticals.add (Ci) end j (P) or len (P) doif fs (Pi) > s (c).get (j) thenrankList (i) or 1else rankList [i] = sortedSecondaryVerticalticalticalticaltical.we"}, {"heading": "3. FEATURES", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Searcher Intent", "text": "A query can be ambiguous in light of all the information that exists in multiple verticals. For example, when a member types in a query such as \"machine learning,\" they may be interested in recruiting machine learners, looking for jobs related to machine learning, finding professional groups on the topic, and discovering content on the topic or some of the use cases. To address this issue, we take a data-driven approach to personalizing search results. For example, if we know that the member is currently looking for a job, they are likely to be more interested in work results than the other verticals. Likewise, when the member hires machine learning scientists, the work results should be more important to him or her."}, {"heading": "3.2 Keyword Intent", "text": "The attribute category aims to capture the intentions (result categories) of queries. Specifically, we mine historical click logs to estimate p (result category | query), for example, the likelihood that members will click on a vertical block of the occupational group for the \"leadership\" query. These probabilities are calculated for each header query offline and use these findings to construct the attributes online. One problem with this approach is that the probabilities are distorted compared to the previous vertical selection and ranking algorithms."}, {"heading": "3.3 Base Ranking Features", "text": "One example of this might be the relevance values of the First Pass Rankers. These characteristics also have an effect that minimizes the inconsistency between the connected scorers and the First Pass Rankers (remember that the order in the primary vertical remains unchanged).One problem with this type of information is that the relevance values may not be calibrated well across all areas. To solve this problem, we re-construct composite characteristics such as relevance values if the result is a single job or a slideshow vertical block. In the later case, we calculate relevance values for each block by calculating the averages of the top scores in the block. Then, we let the learning algorithm normalize values across result categories by learning different weights for the characteristics from the training data."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "It uses a set of secondary business rules based on the secondary interaction of members with verticals associated with keywords and relevance values returned by vertical ranking functions. It can be considered a function based on the characteristics described in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. Although the function is defined manually, it has been running for a relatively long time and has been refined iteratively. The key difference between the baseline and the new approach is that the later highly personalized search result is a key signal. We conducted an A / B test for a sufficient period of time (6 weeks) to account for any novelty effect. A query is initially tagged for the existence of entities such as names, job titles, skills, etc. As we are interested in exploratory search, we experimented only with unnamed queries."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we present the issue of personalized federated search at LinkedIn and propose a data-driven approach to this issue. Our approach takes into account the data and activities of members to derive their intentions such as hiring and job search. This insight, combined with other signals, is used to select primary and secondary verticals and then aggregate primary individual results and secondary clusters into a personalized ranking. Although this approach is currently presented in the LinkedIn context, it is also applicable to other areas where vertical selection and aggregation are highly personalized. Our A / B tests show that the approach could significantly improve user engagement; the approach currently serves the entire federated search on LinkedIn homepage. A future direction of this work is to eliminate the bias towards the previous vertical selection and ranking algorithms in the current characteristics of the keyword intention.An additional direction of this work is to understand the conflict between the primary engagement and the target module."}, {"heading": "6.
