With an aging population and ever-growing demand for critical care, effective management of patient flow and transition among different care facilities will prove indispensible for shortening lengths of hospital stays, improving patient outcomes, allocating critical resources, and reducing preventable re-admissions. In this paper, we focus on a new problem of predicting the so-called ICU patient flow from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), which is not explored via existing machine learning techniques. By treating a sequence of transition events as a point process, we develop a novel framework for modeling patient flow through various ICU care units and predict patients' destination ICUs and duration days jointly. Instead of learning a generative point process model via maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a novel discriminative learning algorithm aiming at improving the prediction of transition events. By parameterizing the proposed model as a mutually-correcting process, we formulate the problem as a generalized linear model, i.e., multinomial logistic regression, which yields itself to efficient learning via alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we achieve simultaneous feature selection and learning by adding a group-lasso regularizer to the ADMM algorithm. Using real-world data of ICU patients, we show that our method obtains superior performance in terms of accuracy of predicting the destination ICU transition and duration of each ICU occupancy.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Feb 2016 21:29:29 GMT  (433kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05112v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Jul 2016 12:13:15 GMT  (1811kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05112v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 05:18:26 GMT  (1167kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05112v3", "in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hongteng xu", "weichang wu", "shamim nemati", "hongyuan zha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.05112"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.05112.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Patient Flow Prediction via Discriminative Learning of Mutually-Correcting Processes", "authors": ["Hongteng Xu", "Weichang Wu", "Shamim Nemati", "Hongyuan Zha"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index terms - patient flow; mutually corrective process; discriminatory learning; logistic regression; group lasso; unbalanced data.F"}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "In recent years, the number of patients residing in Germany has increased significantly in recent years, both in the USA and in Europe.

For each patient u = 1,..., U, their transition process between the CUs is represented by an event sequence in continuous time, which is defined as su = (cui, dui, tui) N u = 1. (Here, t u i, is the time in which a transition event occurred, Tu is the length of the observation period, cui, C = {1,..., C}, is the destination of the transition, dui, D = {1, D}, is the time in which a transition event took place, Tu is the length of the observation period of the patient in the previous CU (i.e., the cui \u2212 1-th CU) before the transition, and Nu is the number of transitions, and Nu is the number of transitions we are passing."}, {"heading": "2.2 Data and Basic Statistics", "text": "We focus on the data from the MIMIC II database [17], from which 30, 685 patients who are in CUs are selected for training and examination. CUs are categorized into C = 8 departments, including the Coronary Care Unit (CCU), the Anaesthesia Intensive Care Unit (FICU), the Cardiology Recovery Unit (CSRU), the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), the Trauma Intensive Care Unit (TSICU), the Neonatology Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and the General Ward (GW). According to the EHRs of patients, the number of treatment ideas is MICU = 5, 627, the number of drug inserts is MICU = 405, the number of care products is MICU points contained in the hospitals found in the hospitals found in the hospitals."}, {"heading": "3 PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "In this section, we take advantage of the characteristics of the patient flow and propose a mutually corrective point process to describe the transitions between the CUs or the duration in them. The proposed model can be regarded as specializing in a general parametric point process model. It has higher capabilities and can represent more complex temporal dynamics of event sequences than existing popular point processes, such as the modulated Poisson process [10], the Hawkes process [18] and the self-correction process [19]. A discriminatory learning algorithm for the point process model is proposed, combining the alternative direction of multipliers (ADMM) and the group lasso. Both the problem of feature selection and the imbalance of data are taken into account in our learning algorithm. Finally, a method for pre-processing training samples is proposed to solve the problem of data imbalance."}, {"heading": "3.1 Mutually-correcting Process Model", "text": "As already mentioned, patient flow is a time-varying transition process in continuous time. It usually has two important properties. Again, patient flow is used in Figure 1 (a) as an example: High correlation between EHRs and patient flow. A typical EHR consists of a patient's profile (i.e., gender, age), their diagnosis of certain diseases (i.e., ICD code) and their treatment process, i.e., drugs, care information, transitions and duration in different care units. It reflects the patient's status and contains very useful information to predict patient flow. Consider the previous cases shown in Figure 1 (a). For a man who has coronary heart disease, the likelihood of staying in the coronary care unit is relatively high, while the likelihood of staying in the neonatal intensive care unit is zero. On the contrary, for a premature baby, the likelihood of staying in the neonatal intensive care unit is high."}, {"heading": "3.2 Discriminative Learning of Model", "text": "Traditional learning methods for point processes are generative, which aim to estimate the common probability of all events by means of a maximum probability estimator, i.e., there is the conditional probability of an event (c, d), and P (Tu) is the cumulative probability that can be transmitted before Tu. Parameters of the model are represented as a matrix, where p (c, d, t) is considered the conditional probability of the event (c, d) the conditional probability of the event (c)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Enhancing Robustness to Imbalanced Data", "text": "As mentioned above, the imbalance of the data has a remarkable impact on the overall performance of the patient work flow forecast, resulting in poor performance of duration and transition prediction of the classes with minority samples (i.e., in the following experiments the accuracy of predicting targets such as ACU, FICU, TSICU, etc.), but is relatively lower than other samples with more patients such as CCU, SCRU, MICU, NICU, etc. As the 2-D case in Figure 4 (a) shows, the classifier trained on unbalanced data will focus more on the accuracy of the classification of the class while ignoring the errors of the class with extremely few sample readings. To eliminate the negative impact of data imbalances, several potential solutions are proposed and analyzed. One reason for the low accuracy of the classes with few samples is that these classes are significant in comparison to the classes."}, {"heading": "3.4 Patient Flow Prediction", "text": "Considering the historical records Hti \u2212 1, we calculate p (c | tui \u2212 1, Huti \u2212 1) and p (d | t u \u2212 1, Huti \u2212 1) for c \u0435C and d \u00d1 D, respectively.

If each dimension of the characteristic is treated as a group, the significance of each group is measured by the amplitude of the coefficient associated with the group, which is called | ig m |. The high amplitude means that the change of the characteristic corresponding to the coefficient has a major impact on the predictive result. Specifically, this means that the characteristic does not change the conditional intensity function and therefore has no effect on the transition to the destination CU and the duration of the treatment. If the coefficient is positive, the corresponding characteristic increases on the conditional intensity function. Such a characteristic (profile, treatment, nursing operation or medication) increases the probability that patients will go to certain CUs and stay for certain days. On the contrary, if the coefficient is negative, the corresponding characteristic decreases to the probability of certain transitions."}, {"heading": "4.4 Impacts of Parameters", "text": "The parameters in our method are the learning rate of the gradient descend \u03b2, the bandwidth of the Gaussian core \u03c3 in our mutual correction process model, the weight of the group lasso \u03b3 and the weight of the extended lagrange. The learning rate \u03b2 controls the step length of the gradient descend. Too large \u03b2 causes our algorithm to be unstable, while too small \u03b2 causes our algorithm to converge too slowly. Following the work in [38] we lower the learning rate \u03b2 with the rate O (k \u2212 1), where k is the number of iterations. Its initial value for our work is called 10 \u2212 4.The parameter \u03c3 controls the importance of historical EHRbased characteristics. If the kernel exp is large (\u2212 t \u2212 t \u2032) 2\u03c32) slowly decreases, which means that the temporal influence of historical events is deformed for a long time."}, {"heading": "5 RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 EHR and Feature Representation", "text": "A typical electronic health record consists of a patient's profile (i.e. gender, age), diagnosis of certain diseases (i.e., ICD code) and treatment process, such as medication, care information, transitions and transitions in different care units. An important application driven by EHRs is the extraction of characteristic physiological characteristics in clinical data or so-called phenotyping [39]. In [40], time phenotyping from EHRs is achieved by a graph-based model, in which a temporal diagram of patient events (i.e. diagnoses and treatments of diseases) is created and phenotypes are extracted by dismantling the adjacent matrix of the diagram. In [41] a binary tensor is created that indicates the diagnosis of the patient and the drugs they use, and phenotypes are obtained by means of non-negative factorization of the tensor with sparse limitations of this [42] deep-penetrating phenotyping."}, {"heading": "5.2 Patient Flow and Traditional Models", "text": "Many EHRs-based patient flow models have been proposed in recent years. Early work in [45] models illustrates patient flows from the point of view of treatment processes and proves that cluster information actually helps to model patient flow in emergency departments. Following this strategy, patient types information is used to estimate the tightness of emergency departments in [46]. For example, the workflow of emergency departments is modeled based on characteristics extracted from patient EHRs in [47] and the work is further specialized in pediatric asthma sufferers in [44]. Furthermore, visualization and analysis of patient flow are achieved jointly in [48], [49] based on patients \"EHRs extracted from EHRs. Most of the above methods are based on EHRs formulated as time series. Many traditional models, such as the Markov chain (MC) model [10], the vector flow model [51] and the VAR model [53] can be used."}, {"heading": "5.3 Continuous-time Models", "text": "However, the continuous Markov chain (CTMC) is proposed in [54] to model the Markov chain in a continuous time domain, which can be considered a special case of Semi-Markov models [37]. Similarly, in [55] a hidden Markov model in a continuous time domain is proposed to capture the temporal trigger patterns between diseases. A continuous HMM is proposed in [55] to model the progression of disease.Point processes are a type of classic tools for modeling continuous event sequences [56]. Hawke's process-based models are proposed to capture the temporal trigger patterns between diseases. A continuous HMM is proposed to model disease progression. Point processes are a type of classic tools for modeling continuous time event sequences [16]. Many different point processes have been proposed for different applications, e.g. the Hawkes process for modeling social networks."}, {"heading": "5.4 Imbalanced Data Processing", "text": "Many methods have been proposed to learn models from unbalanced data. Generally, these methods can be divided into two classes. One type of method is the merging of smaller classes and the gradual learning of binary classifiers [35], [36]. Another is the weighting of training samples to rebalance the data [31], [32], [34], with samples in the smaller classes having large weights while those in the larger classes having low weights. This type of methods has recently been expanded to [33]. Weights are added to the unlabeled samples in logistic regression, which can be regarded as prior knowledge of the model. More recently, unbalanced data processing methods based on auxiliary samples have been proposed. In [61] a classifier based on semi-supervised dictionary learning is proposed for classes with extremely few samples. Unlabeled samples are used as auxiliary samples in the training phase and added adaptively to the smaller classes."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "We focus on predicting patient flow and in this paper propose a novel, mutually corrective process model that reflects the characteristics of patient flow. We also consider the data imbalance problem in the real data sets and propose a novel pre-processing method for training samples that significantly improves learning outcomes. Compared to the most advanced methods, our method achieves superior prediction results on real data sets that have the potential to predict overpopulation or contradictory use of CUs in practical situations. Our method is applicable to model a patient's need for different \"care teams\" within CU. (Intensive care nurses, a pharmacist, a prediction therapist, specialists, problem managers, patients, work time, etc.) We cannot apply the method to the future, but rather the method we can address."}, {"heading": "7 ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This work is supported in part by NIH / NSF BIGDATA R01 GM108341, NSF IIS-1639792, NSF DMS-1620345, and NIH Early Career Development Award in Biomedical Big Data Science (1K01ES025445-01A1)."}], "references": [{"title": "Medicine Committee on the Future of Emergency Care in the US Health System et al., \u201cThe future of emergency care in the united states health system.", "author": ["I. of"], "venue": "Annals of emergency medicine,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Emergency department overcrowding in the united states: an emerging threat to patient safety and public health", "author": ["S.

in the United States has been increasing. With an aging population and ever-growing demand for medical care, effective management of patients\u2019 transitions among different care facilities will prove indispensible for shortening the length of hospital stays, improving patient outcomes, allocating critical care resources, and reducing preventable re-admissions. In this paper, we focus on an important problem of predicting the so-called \u201cpatient flow\u201d from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), which has not been explored via existing machine learning techniques. By treating a sequence of transition events as a point process, we develop a novel framework for modeling patient flow through various CUs and jointly predicting patients\u2019 destination CUs and duration days. Instead of learning a generative point process model via maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a novel discriminative learning algorithm aiming at improving the prediction of transition events in the case of sparse data. By parameterizing the proposed model as a mutually-correcting process, we formulate the estimation problem via generalized linear models, which lends itself to efficient learning based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we achieve simultaneous feature selection and learning by adding a group-lasso regularizer to the ADMM algorithm. Additionally, for suppressing the negative influence of data imbalance on the learning of model, we synthesize auxiliary training data for the classes with extremely few samples, and improve the robustness of our learning method accordingly. Testing on real-world data, we show that our method obtains superior performance in terms of accuracy of predicting the destination CU transition and duration of each CU occupancy.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
