It can be played on any subset of a square grid board, although it is largely limited to rectangular m x n boards, where m denotes the number of rows and n the number of columns. Andersson and Gardner introduced the version was the 8 x 8 board. The game consists of the two players taking turns placing a 1 x 2 piece (domino) on the board, with the first player placing the tile only in a vertical orientation, the second player only in a horizontal orientation. The first player who cannot draw loses the game, his opponent (who made the last move) is declared the winner. As the board is gradually filled, i.e. domineering is a converging game, the game always ends, and ties are impossible. With these rules, the game belongs in the combinational category."}, {"heading": "2 Three Approaches", "text": "The following subsections give a rough characterization of the two main programs used to systematically solve domineering positions so far, and of the program used to obtain the new results, as described in this paper.2.1 A Brute-Force Appoach: DomiThe first systematic analysis of rectangular domineering boards was conducted by Breuker et al. [7,13,17] They developed the Domi program, using a linear variant of the \u03b1-\u03b2 technique [15], reinforced with an implementation table. The algorithm does not have perfect domain knowledge for classifying positions as gains or losses and can therefore be characterized as a pure brut-force approach. Transposition tables with 2M (221) entries were used, with an implementation table called TwoBig [6] in which each entry can store two positions."}, {"heading": "3 New Results", "text": "After almost half a year of calculation time, 11 \u00d7 11 domineering was solved. We provide some data in Section 3.1. Besides, we solved some other new boards. Data is given in Section 3.2.

The result is that the first player under optimal play wins the game.Since the board is square, this is independent of vertical or horizontal movement. To put the solution of the 11 \u00d7 11 board into perspective, we show in Table 1 the results and the number of knots examined to solve square boards up to 11 \u00d7 11 with the three programs mentioned in the previous paragraph.For the result, the investigation of 259,689,994,008 knots was required, with an average speed of 17,211 knots / sec. While this is about ten times slower than the speed of obsequi, this reduction in the speed on the board is substantially compensated by the efficiency of the sequence formation, as evidenced by the much higher number of the sequence."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Solution of New Other Domineering Boards", "text": "The results are set out in Table 2. The most notable results and their consequences are set out below. We use the term result class [10,4,1] of a m \u00b7 n board, which is indicated by [m \u00b7 n]. Other boards with the width or height of the board have already been solved (P, V, or H (1st player) using Lachmann's translational symmetry rules, regardless of who starts). Other boards with the width or height of the board have already been solved (Vertical gains) using Lachmann's translational symmetry rules, and even being solved perfectly."}, {"heading": "3.3 Updated Table of CGT Values of Domineering", "text": "In Table 3, we provide a complete updated overview of all results of solved domineering boards as result classes.

All previously solved boards are solved in the same quantity (for the trivial boards) or much smaller (for the more complex boards) than by previous solutions.The efficiency of our solver enabled the solution of the 11 \u00d7 11 domineering board, which indicates that the first player wins. In addition, several new, more complex boards were solved, which, together with the application of the translational symmetry rules, significantly updated the domineering class landscape. In terms of future work, primarily this compressed overview will be extended to a complete publication, which will include a detailed description of the MUDoS knowledge rules and applied heuristics. In addition, the effects of the rules and heuristics on solution performance will be illuminated separately and in combination with the experiments."}], "references": [{"title": "Lessons in Play: An Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory", "author": ["M.H.
