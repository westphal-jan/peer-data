PIXEL CLASS PROBABILITY ESTIMATION", "text": "This section explains how to assign inner / outer class probabilities to a pixel based on observation of its neighborhood (F1 =). After much successful recent work [18, 22, 23], we use randomized sets of binary tests to characterize the various classes of neighborhood scores. In practice, however, the score is centered around the pixel of interest by a small square window of radius l and size (2l + 1) 2. Each binary test compares the intensity of two pixels and is set to 1 if the first is greater than the second, and to 0 otherwise. Pixel positions of each test are drawn uniformly within the square window. The approach considers N-N sets of S-N binary tests randomly selected to define N flat structures, called ferns. As in [18], we let C-C designate the random variable that represents the class of an image sample, and C {= group of ensembles of the inner class < \u2264 H; we will indicate the inner class ensembles;"}, {"heading": "3. CLASS COMPLIANT ENERGY MINIMIZATION", "text": "The global energy minimization framework introduced in [21, 20] is used to assign cell-representative labels to pixels based on their rear inner / outer class probabilities. (D) Considering a set of n labels L = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7, n), we are looking for a pixel-to-label mapping f that minimizes the energy E (f) where there is the Kronecker delta, P stands for the set of pixels and N for a set of interacting pixels. As detailed as the first term is, Dp (fp) is called data fidelity and measures the cost of the associated pixels p to its label fp. The second term, W (p, q), regulates labeling by distinguishing the labels."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "We validate our segmentation framework using a sequence of images with manually annotated basic truths published publicly = 3. To define our training set on the basis of manually annotated cell contours (white dashed contours in Fig. 2.a), we rely exclusively on morphological operations. In particular, the inner class is set with binary erosion, while the outer class is set with binary dilation. The limit class is composed of pixels located on the outer region of at least 2 different cells. As the number of annotated cells is limited and we force balanced classes for training, our training set is limited to 1500 pixels for each class. To increase the diversity of the training set and become immutable for rotation, we train the ferns on square windows that scan scan the image according to 10 different orientations. Each color includes 10 tests and we use 200 colors. To measure the overall performance, we have performed a 10-fold crossover validation with 94% accuracy and a 1% classification validation."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our work has introduced an energy minimization framework to segment cell images according to the clues that random ferns provide about the probability that each pixel is or is not within a cell. Our framework is extremely versatile, as the definition of classes and energy terms can take into account any prior knowledge related to the problem at hand. Moreover, it is also interactive, in the sense that the definition of the seeds can be easily adjusted manually if necessary."}, {"heading": "6. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] S. Novochin and A.-K.
