Then we have the set of functions as shown in tables 1 and 2, which we can call George Boole Logical Operators, where all such operators of the form x or x y can be interpreted as functions, e.g. (x), or (x, y), and vice versa. If we can call the variable X or the tuple (X, Y), which we call Boolean variables, we can list any of their possible values, and then define in the columns any function that can exist. From these tables we select the functions f3, g2, g8, and g10, which represent the definitions of the boolean NONOT, NONONONOT, NONOX, NOX, and XNOR operators of the logic of x, and so they are displayed in the table."}, {"heading": "2 Definitions of terms", "text": "D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \"D\" D \""}, {"heading": "3 Logic Tables", "text": "We define logic tables in this paper by definition 3.1.

Like the input values, the output value also has a subjective meaning, which can be interpreted either as a calculation or as a consideration of logic, so that the logic table can output the answer to a logical question.
