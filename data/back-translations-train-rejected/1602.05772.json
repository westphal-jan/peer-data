We consider the problem of identifying such \"meaningful subparts\" of language of any length and underlying composition principles in a completely corpus-based and language-independent way without using any kind of prior linguistic knowledge. Unsupervised methods for identifying \"phrases\", mining subphrase structure and finding words in a fully automated way are described. This can be considered as a step towards automatically computing a \"general dictionary and grammar of the corpus\". We hope that in the long run variants of our approach turn out to be useful for other kind of sequence data as well, such as, e.g., speech, genom sequences, or music annotation. Even if we are not primarily interested in immediate applications, results obtained for a variety of languages show that our methods are interesting for many practical tasks in text mining, terminology extraction and lexicography, search engine technology, and related fields.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Feb 2016 12:08:05 GMT  (679kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05772v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["stefan gerdjikov", "klaus u schulz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.05772"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.05772.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Corpus analysis without prior linguistic knowledge - unsupervised mining of phrases and subphrase structure", "authors": ["Stefan Gerdjikov", "Klaus U.

To assess the first property of P (C), we counted in a post-processing step the number of words, word (P) contained in each of the strings P (C) by counting the number of white spaces (P) in each of the strings P (C) and subtracting one of them, unless the string itself turned out to be the beginning or end of a sentence in the corpus P.

The functional scheme for the phrase has the form | den | fu \"r eine | des | and the |. Nuclear subphrase cores that are preserved are u\" ber, Proposal, Directive, European, Parliament, and Council.The results for the phrase decomposition in the European languages are similar. As mentioned above, the functional scheme for a phrase is unique in almost every case, even if there are several decomposition trees.

We consider the problem of identifying such \u201cmeaningful subparts\u201d of language of any length and underlying composition principles in a completely corpus-based and language-independent way without using any kind of prior linguistic knowledge. Unsupervised methods for identifying \u201cphrases\u201d, mining subphrase structure and finding words in a fully automated way are described. This can be considered as a step towards automatically computing a \u201cgeneral dictionary and grammar of the corpus\u201d. We hope that in the long run variants of our approach turn out to be useful for other kind of sequence data as well, such as, e.g., speech, genom sequences, or music annotation. Even if we are not primarily interested in immediate applications, results obtained for a variety of languages show that our methods are interesting for many practical tasks in text mining, terminology extraction and lexicography, search engine technology, and related fields.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
