For each class, we consider a \"natural\" instance, namely a positive closure that can be divided into repairs and the largest elements can be selected (i.e., maximum choices can be combined to define composite modifiers). Considering the three natural instances of these modifiers, we show that their combination produces exactly eight different composite modifiers. Extending an MBox consists in explicitly adding some derived knowledge to your ABoxes. A natural expansion modifier consists in calculating the positive closure of an MBox, which is defined as follows: \"cl\" (M) = \"Cl\" (Ai) | Ai \"M.\" Splitting modifier replaces each Ai of an MBox with one or more of its consistent subsets."}, {"heading": "Inference Strategies for Querying an MBox", "text": "The Universal Conclusion Strategy states that a conclusion is valid if it follows from T and each ABox in M. It is a standard method of deriving conclusions from conflicting sources, used, for example, in Standard Logic (Reiter 1980), where one accepts only conclusions derived from any extension of a Standard Theory. The Existential Conclusion Strategy (also called the Brave Conclusion Relationship) considers all conclusions drawn from T and the intersection of all ABoxes to be valid. < M The Existential Conclusion is a very reasonable and conservative conclusion relationship, since it only takes into account statements shared by different ABoxes.
