Question: Does? Beyersdorff et al. [2] have taken into account all Boolean fragments of Imp (F) and fully classified its computational complexity in terms of the frame of item Grids. However, Post's Grid only talks about limitations on the allowed Boolean functions. Since several subclasses of cnf, such as Horn or Krom, use Boolean functions, \"\u00ac\" and \"Auten,\" such classes are unlimited from the perspective of item Grids. Nevertheless, efficient algorithms for such classes of propositional satisfaction are known."}, {"heading": "3 Strong Backdoors", "text": "In this section, we repeal the concept of backdoors into the world of standard logic.

If cnf is the starting class and horn or krom is the target class, then the backdoor evaluation is in para-NP. If monoton is the target class, then the backdoor evaluation is in para\u0445 p2, which can be solved by a fptalgorithm that can query a SAT solver multiple times [10]. If the target class is positive, the backdoor evaluation is tractable by fixed parameters. An interesting task for future research is to consider the rest Schaefer class [boefer], i.e. dualHorn, 1- and 0-valid, as well as the classes backdoor tractable.We have fixed parameters tractable.A interesting task for future research is to consider the rest Schaefer class [boefer class], i.e. Horn, 1-valid and 1-door, and backdoor."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The first author is grateful for the support of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), Grant Y698.
