A number of problems can be formulated as CSPs, including resource allocation, vehicle routing, circuit diagnosis, planning, and bioinformatics. Over the years, CSPs have become the paradigm of choice to address combinatorial problems by drawing and integrating insights from various areas, including artificial intelligence and surgical research (Rossi et al., 2006).

To accurately reflect these characteristics, researchers introduced the concept of weighted limitation of satisfaction with k = n (Shapiro & Haral-1.

A constraint graph is a standard method of visualizing a DCOP instance. It emphasizes the locality of agent interactions and is therefore generally adopted by DCOP resolution algorithms. In the case of an order diagram o on X, we say that a variable xi has a higher priority in relation to a variable xj when xi appears before xj in o.

They can also be characterized by their runtime characteristics (e.g., their runtime complexity and whether they are always available algorithms), their storage requirements, and their communication requirements (e.g., the number and size of messages they send, and whether they communicate via peer-to-peer channels or by transmission to all agents). Table 4 tabulates the properties of a number of important DCOP algorithms, which we will describe in more detail in Sections 4.3.4 and 4.3.5.

Since the costs incurred by the agent ai may differ from each other, the goal in asymmetrical DCOPs also differs from the goal in classical DCOPs. In view of a cost function fj-F and complete allocation, we have fj (\u03c3, ai) designate the costs incurred by the agent ai through the cost function fj with complete mappings.

Consistency with neighbors \"state variables is imposed by a number of equality restrictions. However, this formalism suffers from scalability problems as it can lead to a significant increase in variables in a DCOP. Furthermore, Grinshpoun et al. (2013) have shown that most of the existing incomplete classical DCOP algorithms cannot be used to effectively resolve asymmetric DCOPs, even if the problems are reformulated by the PEAV model.

Therefore, the flow of information changes the environment over time. To meet such a requirement, researchers have introduced the dynamic DCOP model (DDCOP), where cost functions can change during the problem-solving process, agents can fail and new agents can be added to the DCOP to be solved.

Thus, the algorithms presented in this section will aim to coordinate agents in order to solve a sequence of optimization problems, while reducing uncertainty about the local cost functions and optimizing the global goal (exploitation). Furthermore, the following algorithms are incomplete, and the identity functions of MGM are calculated and communicated. The algorithm is introduced in the context of a wireless sensor network in which agents can perform small movements to improve their communication skills, which are characterized by the distance between pairs of agents."}, {"heading": "7. Quantified DCOPs", "text": "The various extensions of the DCOP model discussed so far differ in terms of drug behavior (deterministic vs. stochastical), drug knowledge (total vs. partial), environmental behavior (deterministic vs. stochastical), and environmental development (static vs. dynamic), but in terms of drug collaboration, all models assume that the agents are fully cooperative. Recently, researchers have introduced the Quantified DCOP (QDCOP) model (Matsui, Matsuo, Silaghi, Hirayama, Yokoo, & Baba, 2010), which assumes that a subset of agents is of a contrarian nature, i.e. that the agents are partially cooperative or competitive."}, {"heading": "7.1 Definition", "text": "The Quantified DCOP (QDCOP) model (Matsui et al., 2010) matches the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem (QCSP) (Benedetti, Lallouet, & Vautard, 2008) and Quantified Distributed CSP (QDCSP) models (Baba, Iwasaki, Yokoo, Silaghi, Hirayama, & Matsui, 2010; Baba, Joe, Iwasaki, & Yokoo, 2011) to the DCOPs. In QCSPs and QDCSPs, all variables are associated with quantifiers and the constraints should be met regardless of the value of the universally quantifiable variables. Similarly, existing () and universal () quantified DCOP variables can be introduced in QDCOP to distinguish the cooperative actors from the opposite influences."}, {"heading": "7.2 Algorithms", "text": "Therefore, classical DCOP algorithms cannot be directly applied to solve QDCOPs. Matsui et al. (2010) proposed several variants of the threshold of ADOPT to solve QDCOPs, all based on a DFS pseudo-tree order. To keep the quantifier order unchanged, the pseudo-tree can be reconfigured by applying additional thresholds for each pair of nodes if necessary. All the algorithms presented here are complete and based on the intuition that universally quantified variables can be viewed as adversally quantified virtual agents with the goal of minimizing the overall goal. Following this intuition and the pseudo-tree modifications discussed above, pseudo-treebased DCOP algorithms can be expanded to solve QDCOP.Min-ADOPT (sui et)."}, {"heading": "8.

Therefore, a distributed approach to channel allocation is required. Cooperative channel allocation problems. In the case of a cooperative channel allocation problem (Hollos, Karl, & Wolisz, 2004; Monteiro, Pellenz, Penna, Enembreck, Souza, & Pujolle, 2012a; Monteiro, Pujolle, Pellenz, Enembreck, & Demo Souza, 2012b), the transmission rate is determined by different signal sources."}, {"heading": "8.3 Recommendation Systems", "text": "Recommendation systems are tools that provide the user with customized information about items that provide information tailored to the characteristics and preferences of the users.

Preferences are a central concept of decision-making and arise in a variety of contexts in multi-agent systems. They are fundamental for analyzing human selection behavior and allow actors to express their inclinations through specific actions and behaviors. Limitations have long been studied in centralized systems (Rossi et al., 2006) and have proven to be particularly practical and efficient for modeling and solving resource allocation and scheduling problems.

The master problem solves a relaxation of the minimax regret goal, where only a subset of all possible joint beliefs is considered, attempting to minimize the loss for the worst case derived from the considered joint belief. Once it generates a solution, the subproblem finds the maximally violated constraint associated to such a solution. This is referred to as the witness point, indicating that the current solution is not the best one in terms of the minimax regret. This point is added to the set of joint beliefs considered by the master problem, and the process is repeated until no new witness points can be found. The worst case runtime requirement of this algorithm is O(`|I|dl), which is dominated by the master problem, whose computation is exponential in the number of variables in the scope of the associated cost function for each belief and iteration of the algorithm. In terms of memory requirement, each ICG-Max-Sum agent needs O(|I|dl) amount of memory (dominated by the master problem again) to store all value combinations of neighboring variables for each belief. In terms of communication requirement, the number of messages sent is the same as that of Max-Sum since two parallel iterations of Max-Sum is executed in each ICG-Max-Sum iteration.

Agents can travel from one location to another in a given time. Each task (i.e., rescuing a victim, extinguishing a fire) has a deadline, representing the time until which the victim will survive, and a workload, denoting the amount of time necessary to rescue the victim or put out the fire. The locations of the victims and the fires may be unknown to the agents, and need to be discovered at runtime, which requires agents to dynamically update the sequence of the tasks they will attempt, taking account of two main constraints: (1) Spatial constraints, which model where an agent can travel and at what time; and (2) Temporal constraints, which model task deadlines and completion times. Agents may also form coalitions to execute a given task faster or if the requirements of a given task cannot be met by a single agent.

Agents can travel from one location to another in a given time. Each task (i.e., rescuing a victim, extinguishing a fire) has a deadline, representing the time until which the victim will survive, and a workload, denoting the amount of time necessary to rescue the victim or put out the fire. The locations of the victims and the fires may be unknown to the agents, and need to be discovered at runtime, which requires agents to dynamically update the sequence of the tasks they will attempt, taking account of two main constraints: (1) Spatial constraints, which model where an agent can travel and at what time; and (2) Temporal constraints, which model task deadlines and completion times. Agents may also form coalitions to execute a given task faster or if the requirements of a given task cannot be met by a single agent. Hence, the agents\u2019 arrival times at each task need to be coordinated in order to form the desired coalition. The objective is to maximize the number of tasks to be completed. A DCOP formalization for the CFST is described by Ramchurn et al. (2010), where ambulances and fire brigades are modeled as DCOP agents.

Agents\u2019 coalitions are defined as groups of agents traveling to the same location. Each task is associated to a utility, which encodes the success for a coalition to complete such task. The goal is to find an assignment of agents to tasks that maximizes the overall utility. A variant of the CFST problem, called the Law Enforcement Problem (LEP), was introduced by Amador, Okamoto, and Zivan (2014).
