Stories also motivate people to learn why they form the backbone of training scenarios and case studies at school or in the workplace. Despite the importance of storytelling as part of the human experience, computers still cannot create and tell reliable new stories, nor understand stories that are told by people. When computers tell stories, via an e-book or computer game, they will simply restore something that was written by a human being. They do not participate in the culture in which we are immersed, as manifested by journalistic news articles, the movies we watch, or the books we read."}, {"heading": "COMPUTATIONAL NARRATIVE INTELLIGENCE", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "MACHINE LEARNING CHALLENGES", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "MACHINE ENCULTURATION", "text": "In addition to the applications described ealier - and assuming that the above challenges can be met - computerized intelligence can be a path toward enculturation. [29] Machine enculturation is the act of injecting social norms, customs, values, and labels into computers so that they can (a) more easily relate to us, and (b) avoid creating (physical or psychological) or social dislocations. In a perfect world, humanity would come up with a user manual that we can easily insert into a computer. However, for any sufficiently complex domain, such as the real world, coding a comprehensive set of values or rewards is necessary to recreate sociocultural behavior, it is unsustainable."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this position paper, we argue that future artificial intelligence should be equipped with computer-assisted narrative intelligence so that it can act like humans or understand human desires, needs, and desires.
