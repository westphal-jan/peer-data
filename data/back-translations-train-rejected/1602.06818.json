Experimental Setup", "text": "In order to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed diagram, the regularized LRR model, the new representation, is fed into the subsequent SVM regression model. For simplicity, we call it GLRR + SVM, which is compared with the following six retrieval models: 1) the operational satellite retrieval algorithms by physical models; 2) the ordinary smallest square regression (OLS); 3) burr regression (RR); 4) NN; 5) SVM; 6) the classic LRR with SVM regressor (LRR + SVM). For NN, the optimal number of hidden nodes is selected from [2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 50] in increments of 5 via a 5-fold cross-validation. For SVM, we adopt the Gausskern core, as it usually achieves the best results in comparison with other cores (LRR + SVM). The optimal variance parameters \u03b3 for both Gausskern and Gausskern nucleus are selected from the 10 in the Gausskins and Gaussker core \u2212 3 in comparison (LRR + SVM)."}, {"heading": "C. Results and Discussion", "text": "For the MODIS dataset, the average RMSE values and the standard deviations to be achieved are in Fig. 2, where the smaller values correspond to the better performances. Several conclusions can be observed from this number. First, in Fig. 2 (b), one can see that the performance of the LRR + SVM is a little better than the physical model. Second, SVM performs best in the four regression models because it can solve the case with low numbers of training samples. 2 (b), the performance of the LRR + SVM is a little better than the SVM when the percentage of training samples is higher than 70%."}, {"heading": "D. Parameter Analysis", "text": "There are two important control parameters \u03bb and \u03b2 in the proposed method: the first is used to balance the effects of the low-level property and noise component, and the second is used to balance the information from the empirical model and the physical model. Figure 6 shows the 3-D diagram of the RMSE against it on MODIS and MISR datasets. Figure 6 (a) shows that the corresponding RMSE increases with increasing \u03bb and \u03b2 and then decreases, reaching the maximum value at \u03bb = 1 and \u03b2 = 10 \u2212 1. Similar results can be seen in Figure 6 (b), and the maximum value appears when \u03bb = \u03b2 = 10."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "Due to the observation that remote sensing data is often located in a low-level subspace, LRR was of course used to reveal the intrinsic data structure from corrupt or noisy observations. In order to obtain the nonlinear structure in remote sensing data, additional graph regulation was added to the LRR model. It is generally known that satellites currently in operation can generate AOD values through physical models. Therefore, the proposed graph model was constructed on the basis of such rich information. By conducting experiments with two sets of data collected from different instruments (MODIS and MISR), we compared the proposed method with the physical models and other state-of-the-art empirical models. Experimental results suggest that the learned representation can improve recovery performance."}], "references": [{"title": "A satellite view of aerosols in the climate system,", "author": ["Yoram J
