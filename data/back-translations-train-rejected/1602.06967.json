Introduction", "text": "A study of the automatic verification process for loudspeakers consists in estimating the probability of two statements belonging to the same loudspeaker. Typically, one statement is taken from a group of target speakers, another is an unknown test expression. Decision is made by comparing the verification process with a threshold. The combination of i-vector and probabilistic linear discrimination analysis (PLDA) is a state-of-the-art method for detecting loudspeakers that makes it possible to obtain this evaluation. The i-vector approach is based on the total variability model [1], which represents loudspeaker data in low-dimensional space. PLDA [2] treats the influence of channel variability in i-vector space [3] and also allows the calculation of the log likelihood ratio (LLR) score between target and non-target variability hypothesis. There are two simultaneous hypotheses that make PLDA dependent on the number of probable influencers, whereby there are different influencers available in the score."}, {"heading": "2.

Speaker dependent distribution of PLDA scores", "text": "In this section we derive specific parameters for score distributions of the target and non-target hypotheses. First, we describe the standard PLDA model and then present the score result in multiple use cases. We approach the score distribution using the Gaussian distribution and examine two cases: when the test vector correlates with the enrollment group of the speaker, i.e. the target hypothesis H1, and when there is no correlation, the distribution of the i-vectors i1,..., iL, PLDA assumes [2] that the i-vectors according to toin = m + Fx + Gyn + enx N (x, 0, Ig) en N (en, 0,) en N (en), where m is the mean vector, x Rf is a loudspeaker factor that should be for all i-vectors of the speaker."}, {"heading": "4.

Data set and PLDA parameters estimation", "text": "The dataset consists of a labeled development set (devset), a labeled model set (modelset) with 5 i-vectors per model, and an unlabeled test set (testset). Since labels for the devset were not available during the challenge, the best results were obtained from methods that made it possible to cluster the devset and then apply PLDA [12, 13]. The original devset labels were used in the presented experiments. In our experiments, the datasets were first pre-processed. Previously, all i-vectors were removed with a runtime of less than 10 seconds [12, 13]. We construct a new labeled trainset, modelset, testset, modelsetCV, testset testsetCV, testsetsetCV, testsetCV.

First, 5 sets of L = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} i-vectors per speaker are configured using the model. This set consists of model set speakers with reduced number of participants and contains 94 speakers with 1 i-vectors per speaker, 93 speakers with 2 i-vectors per speaker, 194 speakers with 3 i-vectors per speaker, 189 speakers with 4 i-vectors per speaker, 113 speakers with 5 i-vectors per speaker."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions and Further Work", "text": "The most important contribution to the existing normalization methods is that this technique does not require any additional development data and is based only on the properties of the PLDA model, which ensures more stable verification values with almost no additional computational costs. Experiments conducted on the NIST SRE 2014 database show that the minimum DCF value in the mixed enrollment condition decreases. In further work, the problem of the non-Gaussian distribution of PLDA values can be considered, which can lead to a more accurate estimate of the specific threshold of the speaker."}, {"heading": "6.
