Vulnerabilities in web applications allow malicious actors to access and/or modify restricted data. Here the hackers have the opportunity to perform reconnaissance so as to gain knowledge about the web application layout before launching an attack, whereas the defender (administrator of the web application) must secure the application even with its potential vulnerabilities. In order to mask such vulnerabilities which are primarily associated with different individual configurations, Moving Target Defense systems were proposed wherein the defender switches between various configurations thereby making it difficult to attack with success, while maintaining a seamless experience for the genuine users. However, the design of good quality switching strategies is still an open problem which is crucial for the effectiveness of the Moving Target Defense approach. In this paper, we present a way to find effective switching strategies by modeling this ecosystem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game with the administrator as the leader and the hackers as the followers, which as we show succinctly captures various aspects of the Moving Target Defense systems. Furthermore, we show how to determine which vulnerability areas should be addressed first once the system is deployed and which attacker type uncertainties should be calibrated with high precision, for increasing the security of the web application. We present experimental results on a representative web application system demonstrating the utility of switching strategies obtained using the proposed method, and we discuss various future directions that are unique to the web application domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 03:44:16 GMT  (1184kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07024v1", "10 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 18:20:38 GMT  (355kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07024v2", "7 pages, 2 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 01:04:59 GMT  (372kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07024v3", "9 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "authors": ["sailik sengupta", "satya gautam vadlamudi", "subbarao kambhampati", "marthony taguinod", "adam doup\\'e", "ziming zhao", "gail-joon ahn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07024"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.07024.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Moving Target Defense for Web Applications using Bayesian Stackelberg Games", "authors": ["Sailik Sengupta", "Satya Gautam Vadlamudi", "Subbarao Kambhampati", "Marthony Taguinod", "Adam Doup\u00e9", "Ziming Zhao", "Gail-Joon Ahn"], "emails": ["rao}@asu.edu", "gahn}@asu.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

To increase complexity, the cost of switching from one configuration c \u00b2 to another configuration c \u00b2 cannot be trivial and not uniform. Therefore, the goal of a good strategy is to maximize the effectiveness of an MTD system while trying to minimize the cost of switching. [18] We are now developing a game theory system to distribute switching strategies for web applications (PC = 1 / | C |) and assume that switching between configurations generates uniform costs."}, {"heading": "4.

The j \u2212 te defender type is represented by \u03b82j. When an attacker attacks an application, his beliefs about what (resource / data) is most valuable to the application owner (defender) remain consistent. Therefore, we assume that the attacker knows that there is only one type of defender when he attacks a particular web application. Therefore, we have beliefs about what (resource / data) is most valuable to the application type (defender).

If there is no common technology between the c and c configurations involved in a switching operation, the costs will be high. Also, changing technologies in one particular layer can cost more than changing technologies in other layers. In the developed MTD system, we find that switching between databases entails high costs, because the structure of the data has to be changed for shifting, and the time it takes to copy huge amounts of data from one database to another."}, {"heading": "5. SWITCHING STRATEGY GENERATION", "text": "In this section, we first introduce the concept of the Stackelberg balance for our security game, which gives us a defense strategy that maximizes its reward (and hence the security of the system), we briefly talk about optimization methods that are relevant to our area and can produce it, and finally, we include the cost of switching to objective function and propose our solver."}, {"heading": "5.1 Stackelberg Equilibrium", "text": "The strategy generated for the designed game must capture the exploration aspect. Note that the game only begins after the defender has used the web application that acts as the leader, and this becomes a repetitive game in which an attacker can observe a finite number of switch moves and probably learn the defender's switching strategy. (Since the attacker maximizes his reward in this game, this is exactly the problem of finding the Stackelberg equilibrium in a Bayesian game [20]. The resulting mixed strategy is the switching strategy for the defender in our MTD system. Unfortunately, this problem becomes NP-hard in our case due to multiple attack types. [5] Before we find a strong Stackelberg equilibrium for our proposed game, we make some well-founded assumptions that we make. First, an attacker chooses a pure strategy, i.e. a single attack action that maximizes its value."}, {"heading": "5.2 Incorporating Switching Costs", "text": "As defined in the last section, the costs of switching from a configuration i to a configuration j are essentially new. (The probability that the system will switch to configuration i and then to configuration j is high. (Thus, the costs incurred by the defender for switching from i to j are high.) The expected costs for each switch are high. (The expected costs for each switch are high.) The costs incurred by the defender for switching from i to j can be deducted from the objective function of Equation 1 with a factor of cost accountability. (The expected costs for each switch are high.) The expected costs for each switch are high. (The expected costs for switching are high.) The costs for switching are high.) The costs are high."}, {"heading": "6. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION", "text": "The aim of this section is to answer three key questions. First, does our proposed Bayesian Stackelberg Game (BSG) model generate better strategies that reflect the state of the art? Second, can we effectively calculate the set of critical vulnerabilities? Finally, who are the sensitive attacker types and how robust is our model? 6.1 Test Bed DescriptionTo answer the above questions, we are developing a real MTD web application (shown in Figure 1) with 2 layers. The key idea of applying MTD to web applications requires multiple versions of the same system, each written in a different language, with a different database, etc. This diversity is not ubiquitous in outdated web applications, due to the cost, time and resources required to build multiple versions of the same web application. To support this, we developed a framework that is necessary for this web application."}, {"heading": "6.2 Strategy Evaluation", "text": "We evaluate our method using Bayesian Stackelberg Games on our real web application against the Uniform Random Strategy (URS), which is the state of the art in such systems. [18] We record the values of the objective function in Equation 2 for both strategies, while the value of the changes is \u03b1 from 0 to 1. For URS we use the exact values of wij = 0.25 \u043c 0.25 \u0445 i, j. The plot is in Figure 2. Both are straight forward, because although the value of the changes from \u03b1 varies, the strategy for URS is the same (by definition) and the value generated by BSG remains the same. The latter case came as a surprise to us at first when we noticed that in the game formulated for our web application the Stackelberg Equilibrium for our application coincides (fortunately) with the least changing cost strategy. These attack and defense strategies are shown in Table 3 along with the value of the defense reward of the defender."}, {"heading": "6.3 Identifying Critical Vulnerabilities", "text": "In the real world development teams it is impossible to solve all the vulnerabilities, especially in a system with so many technologies. In current software systems, given a number of vulnerabilities, a common question is what vulnerabilities should be fixed in order to improve security? For an MTD system, this becomes a difficult problem, as the defender has to think about several types of attack - their probabilities and actions. For a given k, the amount of k vulnerabilities that lead to the highest gain in defense strategy in fixing them is called a critical vulnerability (k \u2212 CV). To address this problem, we remove each k-large attack from the set of all attacks (A \u2032 2 = A2\\ D value) and evaluate the objective function (Equation 2). The sets A \u00b2, which provide the highest objective values, provide the vulnerabilities V3 that should be fixed to improve the system of the distributor. We have tried to apply this complicated behavior to our toy games before applying it to some."}, {"heading": "6.4 Model Robustness & Attacker Type Sensitivity", "text": "In this section we will see how this uncertainty affects the optimal rewards generated by the system. We will provide an idea for determining sensitive attack types and measuring the robustness of a changing attack strategy. For each attack type i, we will vary the probability of P\u03b82i by \u00b1 x% (Pnew\u03b82i = P\u03b82i), where x is the sensitivity factor that can be varied from a low value to a high value as needed. Note that now p = Packer 2i \u00b7 x100 the ability of the attack type must be adjusted by \u00b1 x% or distributed among the probabilities of the remaining attack types. To ensure that this distribution is such that the sensitivity of the attacker i actually stands out, we suggest distributing p among the other attack types using a weighted model according to their existing probabilities."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we propose a method for generating a switching strategy for real web applications based on the Moving Target Defense (MTD) architecture. To find an effective switching strategy, we model the system as a repetitive Bayesian game. We develop methods for assigning attack actions to attack types and create realistic utilities based on the expertise of security experts. To obtain real attack data, we mitigate vulnerabilities in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and obtain utilities based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). We also formulate an optimization problem that outputs a switching strategy that maximizes system security while taking into account costs. The generated strategy proves to be more effective than the state-of-the-art for a real-world application. We also provide metrics that can be used to verify the robustness of multi-strategy switching systems, which are not used in the literature on cybersecurity systems."}, {"heading": "8.

designing web applications makes software security a difficult goal to achieve. An attacker can explore a deployed service on the web and attack at his/her own leisure. Moving Target Defense (MTD) in web applications is an effective mechanism to nullify this advantage of their reconnaissance but the framework demands a good switching strategy when switching between multiple configurations for its web-stack. To address this issue, we propose modeling of a real-world MTD web application as a repeated Bayesian game. We then formulate an optimization problem that generates an effective switching strategy while considering the cost of switching between different web-stack configurations. To incorporate this model into a developed MTD system, we develop an automated system for generating attack sets of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for input attacker types with predefined capabilities. Our framework obtains realistic reward values for the players (defenders and attackers) in this game by using security domain expertise on CVEs obtained from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). We also address the issue of prioritizing vulnerabilities that when fixed, improves the security of the MTD system. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of our proposed model by evaluating its performance when there is uncertainty about input attacker information.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
