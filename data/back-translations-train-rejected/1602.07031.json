The Era of MBD", "text": "Figure 1 (a) shows a typical architecture of large mobile systems that connect different types of mobile devices such as smartphones, portable computers, and IoT devices; the widespread installation of different types of sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, and GPS sensors in modern mobile devices enables many new applications; essentially, each mobile device encapsulates its service needs and its own sensory data into stateless data exchange structures, such as the Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format; the stateless format is important because mobile devices run on different mobile operating systems, such as Android, IOS, and Tizen; and based on the collected MBD, a service server uses MBD analysis to uncover hidden patterns and information; and the importance of MBD analysis stems from its role in building complex mobile systems that could not be assembled and configured on small sets of data."}, {"heading": "B. Challenges of MBD Analytics", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, move and move have to move."}, {"heading": "III. DEEP LEARNING IN MBD ANALYTICS", "text": "Deep learning is a new branch of machine learning that can solve a wide range of complex problems in MBD analysis, such as classification and regression; a deep learning model consists of simulated neurons and synapses that can be trained to learn hierarchical characteristics from existing MBD samples; the resulting deep model can generalize and process invisible streaming MBD samples; for convenience, we present a general discussion of deep learning methods without focusing on the derivatives of certain techniques; however, we refer interested readers to technical papers from deep faith networks [6] and stacked autoencoders [7]; a deep model can be scaled to contain many hidden layers and millions of parameters that are trained at once; instead, greedy layer learning algorithms [7] are proposed that essentially work as follows:"}, {"heading": "A. Deep Learning Advantages in MBD Analytics", "text": "Deep learning provides solid learning models for MBD analysis. This argument can be supported by the following advantages of using deep learning in MBD analysis: \u2022 Deep learning achieves high-precision results that are a top priority for growing mobile systems. High-precision results from MBD analysis are required for sustainable business and effective decision making. Thus, in [8] the authors propose a method for localizing indoor laboratories using deep learning and channel state information. [9] Deep learning is successfully applied to inference tasks in mobile sensors, such as activity and emotion detection and loudspeaker detection. \u2022 Deep learning generates intrinsic features needed in MBD analysis. One feature is a measurement that is extracted from sensory data to capture the underlying phenomenon and enable more effective MBD analysis."}, {"heading": "B. Deep Learning Challenges in MBD Analytics", "text": "Capturing MBD is unprofitable if appropriate learning methods and analytics are not used to gather meaningful information and patterns. Deep learning in MBD analytics is slow and can take several days, which does not meet the operational requirements of most modern mobile systems, due to the following challenges: \u2022 The Curse of Dimensionality: MBD is associated with \"volume\" and \"speed\" related challenges. Historically, data analysis has been used on small amounts of collected data (also known as a random sample). Despite the low computing load of random sampling, it suffers from poor performance in invisible streaming samples. This performance problem is typically avoided by using the full set of available big data samples, significantly increasing the computing load. \u2022 Large-scale deep models: To fully capture information about MBD and avoid underpass, deep learning models should contain millions of free parameters."}, {"heading": "IV. A SPARK-BASED DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR MBD ANALYTICS", "text": "Figure 3 shows the proposed architecture for learning deep models on MBD with Apache Spark. Apache Spark [2] is an open source platform for scalable MapReduce calculations on clusters. The main goal of the proposed framework is to accelerate MBD decision-making by paralleling learning deep models with a high-performance computing cluster. In short, parallelizing a deep model is done by splitting the MBD into many partitions. Each partition is contained in a robust distributed data set (RDD) that provides an abstraction for data distribution through the Spark engine. In addition to caching the data, RDDs of a deep model support native fault-tolerant execution and restore program operations on worker nodes. In short, our Spark-based framework is based on two subcomponents (partial driver 1 and partial Spark model execution)."}, {"heading": "A. Parallelized Learning Collections", "text": "In a first step, the parameters of the model are replaced by the averaging of the calculated gradient updates. These two steps are suitable for learning deeper models in the maputation of the model [11]. In a second step, the parameters of the model are updated by averaging the calculated gradient updates."}, {"heading": "B. Discussion", "text": "The proposed framework is based on deep learning and Apache Spark technologies to perform effective MBD analysis. This integration addresses the challenging characteristics of MBD as follows. \u2022 Deep Learning: Deep Learning addresses the \"value\" and \"diversity\" aspects of MBD. First, deep learning in MBD analysis helps to understand the raw MBD. Therefore, deep learning effectively addresses the \"value\" aspect of MBD. MBD analytics, as discussed in this article, is an integral part of delivering custom mobile services. Second, deep learning enables learning from multimodal data distributions [10], such as concatenated inputs of accelerometers and light sensors, which are important for the \"diversity\" of MBD. \u2022 Apache Spark: The main role of the Spark platform in the proposed framework is to address the \"volume,\" speed, and \"complexity\" of MBD models in MBBD."}, {"heading": "V. PROTOTYPING CONTEXT-AWARE ACTIVITY RECOGNITION SYSTEM", "text": "Context awareness [3], [5] greatly influences the understanding of MBD by describing the circumstances in which the data was collected to provide end users with a personalized mobile experience, such as targeted advertising, health care, and social services. One context contains information features to describe the perceived environment, such as human activities performed, surrounding objects, and locations. A Context Learning Model is a program that defines the rules for mapping between raw sensory data and the corresponding context markers, such as mapping acceleration signals to activity markers. This section describes a case study in which we consider a context-aware activity recognition system, such as the recognition of walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, standing, and lying down. We use real data sets during the training of deep activity detection models."}, {"heading": "A. Problem Statement", "text": "Accelerometers are sensors that measure the correct acceleration of an object due to motion and gravitational force. Modern mobile devices are largely equipped with tiny acceleration circuits made of electromechanically sensitive elements that generate an electrical signal in response to each mechanical motion. Correct acceleration differs from coordinate acceleration in classical mechanics, which measures the speed of the change in velocity, while the former measures the acceleration relative to free fall, i.e. the correct acceleration of an object in free fall is zero. Consider a mobile device with an embedded acceleration sensor that generates proper acceleration samples. Activity detection is applied to time series data formulated by means of a sliding and overlapping window. The number of time series samples depends on the sampling frequency of the acceleration sensor (in hertz) and the winding length (in seconds)."}, {"heading": "B. Experimental Setup", "text": "In this section, we use the Actitracker dataset [13], which contains acceleration samples of 6 conventional activities (walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, standing, and lying down) from 563 crowdsourced users. Figure 4 (a) records acceleration signals from the 6 different activities. It is clear that radio frequency signals are sampled for activities with active body movement, such as walking, jogging, and climbing stairs. On the other hand, low frequency signals are collected during semi-static body movements, such as standing, sitting, and lying down. The data is collected by mobile phones with a sampling rate of 20 Hz, and they contain both labeled and unlabeled data from 2, 980, 765, and 38, 772 samples. This is a real example of the limited number of labeled data that is compared with unlabeled data."}, {"heading": "C. Experimental Results", "text": "The effects of deep models: Figure 4 (b) shows the activity detection errors in the depth models (number of hidden layers and number of neurons in each layer), in particular the ability of a deep model to detect MBD structures is increased by the use of deeper models with more layers and neurons. Nevertheless, a significant increase in computer loads and times develops. An accuracy comparison of the deeper activity models and other conventional methods is shown in Table I. In short, these models are better than existing flat context models, and (2) the learned hierarchical features of the deep models eliminate the need for deeper activity in conventional methods."}, {"heading": "VI. FUTURE WORK", "text": "On the basis of the proposed framework, the following future work can be continued."}, {"heading": "A. Crowd Labeling of MBD", "text": "A major challenge for MBD analysts is the limited amount of labeled data samples, as data labeling is typically a manual process. An important area of research is the development of crowd tagging methods for MBD. Crowd tagging can be designed as part of two main systems: (1) paid crowd tagging and (2) embedded crowd tagging. Paid crowd tagging allows mobile crowdsourced users to comment on mobile data and pay accordingly based on their tagging performance and speed. In this paid scheme, optimal budget allocation methods are required. In embedded crowd tagging, data tagging can also be achieved by adding tagging tasks within mobile application functions, such as CAPTCHA-based image tagging [14], where mobile users can access more features of a mobile application by indirectly assisting in the data tagging process."}, {"heading": "B. Economics of MBD", "text": "MBD, as discussed in this article, is about extracting meaningful information and patterns from raw mobile data, which is used to make decisions and improve existing mobile services. An important area of research is the development of business models, such as pricing and auction design [15], for the sale and purchase of MBD among mobile organizations and parties."}, {"heading": "C. Privacy and MBD Collection", "text": "Because MBD is person-centric, mobile users would be concerned about the risks of sharing their personal mobile data with a service server. Therefore, a small percentage of users will opt out of sharing their personal data if trusted data protection mechanisms are not in place. Meanwhile, anonymized data collection, i.e. data that cannot be used to identify individuals, is being taken over by many services. An alternative direction of research is to propose fair data sharing models that encourage the sharing of mobile data in return for reward points, such as reward membership points."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this article, we presented and discussed a scalable Spark-based framework for deep learning in mobile big data analysis that allows deep models to be adapted with many hidden layers and millions of parameters in a cloud cluster. Typically, deep learning provides a promising learning tool for adding value by learning intrinsic features from raw mobile big data. Finally, the framework was validated as a case study using a large-scale activity detection system. Finally, important research directions on mobile big data were outlined."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This work was supported by the A * STAR Computational Resource Centre through the use of its supercomputers.
