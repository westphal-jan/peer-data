This plays a crucial role in the design of educational software, leading to a trade-off between teaching new material and reviewing what has already been taught. A common way to balance this trade-off is via spaced repetition -- using periodic review of content to improve long-term retention. Though widely used in practice, there is little formal understanding of the design of these systems. This paper addresses this gap. First, we mine log data from a spaced repetition system to establish the functional dependence of retention on reinforcement and delay. Second, based on this memory model, we develop a mathematical framework for spaced repetition systems using a queueing-network approach. This model formalizes the popular Leitner Heuristic for spaced repetition, providing the first rigorous and computationally tractable means of optimizing the review schedule.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "The ability to learn and retain is an essential part of human life."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "The scientific literature on modeling human memory is highly active and dates back more than a century. One of the simplest memory models, the exponential oblivion curve, was first examined by Ebbinghaus in 1885 [9] - it models the likelihood of seeing an object as an exponentially decaying function of time that has elapsed since the previous review. The exact manner in which strength evolves as a function of ratings, the length of evaluation intervals, and other factors are a matter of debate, although there is a consensus about the existence of a distance effect leading to greater strength than mass evaluations (i.e., cracking)."}, {"heading": "1.2 Our Contributions", "text": "The main contributions of this paper fall into two categories: First, the paper presents a principal methodology for designing review planning systems with different learning goals; second, the models we have developed provide qualitative insights and general principles for periodic review. The general reasoning in this paper consists of the following three steps:"}, {"heading": "1. Mining large-scale log data to validate human memory", "text": "The results we have presented in Section 2 supplement the existing literature on memory models and provide the empirical basis on which we build our mathematical model of distance repeater. Our framework to which we refer is the queue network, which is based on ideas from queue theory and workplace planning. Although the queue network is conceptually simple and easy to simulate, it does not offer a comprehensible way to optimize the check plan. To this end, we propose a (heuristic) approximate model that is close to our original low arrival rate model."}, {"heading": "2.

We assume a variant of exponential forgetting of the standard model in which memory is binary (i.e., a user either fully remembers an element or forgets the probability that an element will be recalled has the following functional form: P [...] exponential forgetting curve."}, {"heading": "3. A STOCHASTIC MODEL FOR SPACED REPETITION SYSTEMS", "text": "Based on the memory model developed in the previous section (as summarized in Eqn. 2), we now present a stochastic model for a repetition system with intervals and outline how we can use it to design good repetition positions. We reiterate that all existing systems for assigning repetition frequencies to decks in the Leitner system, and indeed in all other repetition systems with intervals, are based on heuristics without formal optimum guarantees. One of our key contributions is to provide a principle-driven method for determining appropriate timelines for spatial repetition systems. We focus on a regime in which the learner wants to memorize a very large amount of items - in particular the number of items available is much greater than the potential time required for memorization. A canonical example of such a setting is learning words in a foreign language that are always available to a new system (from a technical standpoint of view, this overrides the technical assumption that a new system is available to a new system)."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Leitner Queue Network", "text": "We model the dynamics of the flashcards in an n-deck Leitner system with a network of n queues, as shown in Figure 4. Formally, we associate each deck with a different deck, where Qk is the number of items in the deck at present t, and Tk, j < t is the time when the jth item in deck k first entered the system (note that times are sorted). A new item is introduced into the system determined by the scheduler - it is first shown to the user (who we have not seen it before), and then it is shown to Deck 1.We assume that the learner has a review frequency (e.g. the maximum rate at which the user can check the items) of U that is to be split between reviews, and we assume that the items in Deck 1.We have a review frequency."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Mean-Recall Approximation", "text": "The stochastic model in Section 3.1 covers all the important details of the Leitner system - however, its time-homogeneous nature means that it does not allow a closed program to optimize the review plan. \u2212 In this section, we propose an approach technology for the Leitner Queue Network, which reduces the problem of selecting an optimal review plan to a low-dimensional optimization problem. \u2212 The simulation results in Section 3.3 (see Figure 6) suggest that the two models closely correspond to the low arrival rates. \u2212 However, we note that this approach is essentially heuristic and that obtaining more rigorous approximations for the proposed Leitner Queue model is an important issue for future work. \u2212 The main idea behind converting the model in Section 3.1 to a time-homogeneous model is that for small values of the system appears stable."}, {"heading": "3.3 Features of Optimal Leitner Schedules", "text": "The most important qualitative prediction of our model is the presence of a phase transition in learning outcomes: given a schedule {\u00b5k}, there is a threshold \u03bbt s.t. for all \u03bbext > \u03bbt, but there are no workable solutions {\u03bbk} satisfactory Eqn. 4. In addition, we simulate a review session with 500 evaluations and 50 unique items for different growth values. We observe that a sharp phase transition actually occurs as the arrival rate is in-generated.

We now have b parallel Leitner Queue Networks coupled with the budget constraint that applies to the sum of service tariffs within the networks for each \u03b8. We can assume that the traffics are a priori known (e.g. from log data or expert comments). To understand the effect of different affici, we compare the optimal schedule for different affici (but with the same budget U) in Fig. 12. The result is interesting because, to our knowledge, there is little understanding of how the user should adjust the frequency of deck checking when the general difficulty of articles changes. Fig. 12 suggests that for generally simple articles, the user should spend roughly the same amount of time on each deck; however, if articles are of higher general difficulty, the user should spend more time on higher decks than on lower ones."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION", "text": "To empirically test the reliability of the Leitner Queue Network as a model for spatial repetition, we are conducting an experiment with Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in which participants memorize words from a foreign language. Our study is designed to experimentally verify the existence of the phase transition (Figure 5), the primary qualitative prediction of our model."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experiment Setup", "text": "A total of 331 users (\"turkers\") on the MTurk platform were asked to participate in a vocabulary learning task. At the beginning of the task, the vocabulary used in the task was randomly selected from one of two categories: Japanese (words) and American Sign Language (animated gestures).

Each task was sampled on last4https: / / en.wiktionary.org / wiki / Attachment: 1000 Japanese keywords for Japanese and http: / / www.lifeprint.com / 15 minutes, and Turks were compensated for completing the task regardless of their performance. The task used the interface shown in the figure. 13: a flashcard that first displays the element in the foreign language (either word or gesture), and a pair of YES / NO keys to collect the user's input in response to the question \"Do you know this user? If the word was selected in English?\""}, {"heading": "4.2 Results", "text": "Fig. 14 superimposes the empirical learning rate from the MTurk data for each arrival rate condition on the learning rate curve for the simulated Leitner queue network (such as Fig. 5) using the parameter values for \u03b8 and U, which were measured using the MTurk data (see caption in Fig. 5 for details).The simulated and empirical curves closely correspond; in particular, the MTurk data show the phase transition in the learning rate predicted by our theoretical model. In addition to calculating the observed throughput for the different arrival rates in the MTurk data, we calculate the average distribution of items across the five decks and the stack of masted items at the end of a session. This gives insight where items accumulate in unstable regimes. Fig. 15 illustrates the same phase transition observed earlier in the MTurk data Items: If the arrival rate increases, we first see an increase in the number of items relative to the most optimal Items, but the number of items remains relatively less stable."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION AND OPEN QUESTIONS", "text": "Our work develops the first formal mathematical model for thinking about repetition systems by far, which is validated by empirical data and provides a principle-based, computationally traceable algorithm for planning flashcards. Our formalization of the Leitner system suggests maximum learning speed as a natural design metric for repetition software by far; using techniques from queue theory, we derive a traceable program for calibrating the Leitner system to optimize learning speed. our queue system opens doors to the use of a large body of work in this area to develop more complex extensions. To inspire and facilitate future work in this direction, we publish (1) all the model and evaluation codes, (2) framework codes for conducting user studies, and (3) the data collected in our Mechanical Turk study to provide the data and code for replicating our experiments, which we provide online for further research at http: / hard.qi.us."}, {"heading": "6.
