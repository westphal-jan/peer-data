Our goal is to design market mechanisms in which participants' trades or wagers influence the market's behavior in a way that leads to accurate predictions, yet no single participant has too much influence over what others are able to observe. We study the possibilities and limitations of such mechanisms using tools from differential privacy. We begin by designing a private one-shot wagering mechanism in which bettors specify a belief about the likelihood of a future event and a corresponding monetary wager. Wagers are redistributed among bettors in a way that more highly rewards those with accurate predictions. We provide a class of wagering mechanisms that are guaranteed to satisfy truthfulness, budget balance in expectation, and other desirable properties while additionally guaranteeing epsilon-joint differential privacy in the bettors' reported beliefs, and analyze the trade-off between the achievable level of privacy and the sensitivity of a bettor's payment to her own report. We then ask whether it is possible to obtain privacy in dynamic prediction markets, focusing our attention on the popular cost-function framework in which securities with payments linked to future events are bought and sold by an automated market maker. We show that under general conditions, it is impossible for such a market maker to simultaneously achieve bounded worst-case loss and epsilon-differential privacy without allowing the privacy guarantee to degrade extremely quickly as the number of trades grows, making such markets impractical in settings in which privacy is valued. We conclude by suggesting several avenues for potentially circumventing this lower bound.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 00:30:12 GMT  (49kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07362v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["rachel cummings", "david m pennock", "jennifer wortman vaughan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07362"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.07362.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Possibilities and Limitations of Private Prediction Markets", "authors": ["Rachel Cummings", "David M.

In recent decades, prediction markets designed specifically for evaluation and aggregation have yielded useful predictions in areas such as politics [Berg et al., 2001], disease surveillance [Polgreen et al., 2007], and entertainment [Pennock et al., 2002] The desire to aggregate and trade information that is strategically valuable among employees has led many companies to experiment with internal prediction markets. An internal corporate market could be used to predict the launch date of a new product or product. Among the first companies to experiment with internal markets were Hewlett-Packard, which implemented real money markets, which operated their own currency markets, and those of Google."}, {"heading": "2 Tools from Differential Privacy", "text": "The most basic version of differential privacy is used to measure the privacy of a randomized algorithm when it is specified as entering a database D with n entries from a single input domain. Differential privacy is often examined in settings where the n entries are provided by n agents, each of whom would like to keep its entry private. Two databases D and D \"are referred to as adjacent if they differ only in a single entry. Differential privacy requires that the distribution of the results of the algorithms is\" close \"to the distribution of their output, since each adjacent database is D.\" For these definitions, it is sufficient to consider an \"algorithm\" as a randomized function that maps inputs to outputs; we are not concerned about the exact way in which the outputs are calculated. In the following definitions, we limit ourselves to real-rated outputs for the algorithms."}, {"heading": "3 Private Wagering Mechanisms", "text": "We start with the problem of designing a unique betting mechanism that encourages betting providers to truthfully report their beliefs while preserving their privacy; a betting mechanism that allows a number of betting providers to set a belief about a future event and a cash bet each; bets are collected by a centralized operator and redistributed to betting providers in such a way that betting providers with more accurate predictions get a higher reward; Lambert et al. [2008] showed that the class of weighted score betting mechanisms (WSWMs) is the unique class of betting mechanisms to meet a number of desired axioms such as budget balance and truthfulness; in this section, we show how to design a randomized betting mechanism that achieves a common differentiated privacy while maintaining the beautiful features of the WSWMs as expected."}, {"heading": "3.1 Standard wagering mechanisms", "text": "In this paper, we focus on binarywagering mechanisms, in which each company submits a report indicating how likely it is that a particular event will occur, along with a payment indicating a function of the maximum amount of money it is willing to lose.

Using Theorem 1 in mind, we also want the betting mechanism to be defined so that each player is able to adequately consider his own privacy. However, the sensitivity is difficult to precisely define, but loosely put, we want it to be the case that 1) the magnitude of E [p, m, s] varies sufficiently with the choice of pi, and 2) there is not too much noise or variance in a bettor's gain, i.e., the magnitude of E [p, m, s] is generally not too far from E [p, m, s].A natural first attempt would be to use the standard laplace mechanisms [Dwork and Roth, 2014] based on an independent laplace noise."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Sensitivity of the mechanism", "text": "Once we have established that our mechanism meets the characteristics of (a) and (b) - (h), we will next address the sensitivity of the mechanism with respect to the two facets described above: the range of achievable expected profits and the level of noise in the profit function. This discussion sheds light on how these should be put into practice. The first facet is quantified by Lemma 1. As \u03b1 grows, the magnitude of expected profits of operators and the range of expected profits also grows. If we approach 1, the range of profits achievable through the private betting mechanism approaches the standard WSWM with the same correct score. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the expected profits of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of larger operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of operators of larger operators of operators of operators and the range of profits achieved by operators of operators of larger operators of operators of operators of operators."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Keeping wagers private", "text": "The same tricks used in our private betting mechanism could be used to obtain a privacy guarantee for both reports and bets when bets are limited to a limited range [L, U], but this would result in a large loss of sensitivity. In the simplest case, the additional factor \u03b1 would have to be set to (L / U) (1 \u2212 e \u2212 / n) rather than (1 \u2212 e \u2212), which would greatly reduce the scale of achievable profits and in most cases make the mechanism impractical. L / U's additional factor stems from the fact that the effect of one bet on the gain of another bet must be roughly the same whether it bets the maximum amount or the minimum. The poor dependence on n is somewhat more subtle. We created a mechanism of private belief by replacing the results of each bet with a random -js in the WSWM by a random amount or a random amount that cannot be replaced by a variable."}, {"heading": "4 Limits of Privacy with Cost-Function Market Makers", "text": "In practice, forecasting markets are often operated with dynamic mechanisms that update in real time as new information interfaces. We are now addressing the problem of adding additional privacy safeguards to continuous trading markets. We are focusing our attention on the cost-function forecasting markets, where all trades are placed by an automated market maker [Hanson, 2003, Chen and Pennock, 2007, Abernethy et al., 2013]. Market Maker can be considered a streaming algorithm that records a stream of trades and issues a corresponding stream of market states from which trading prices can be calculated. Therefore, the privacy safeguards we seek are in the form of Definition 3. We are asking whether automated market makers are able to evaluate trades according to a cost function while maintaining (t) -differentiated privacy without allowing traders the ability to achieve unlimited profits, resulting in market makers having to achieve unlimited results as a result of unlimited trading (although we predominantly see an early loss)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Standard cost-function market makers", "text": "We are considering a position in which there is a single binary security that traders can buy or sell.

In this section, we define and analyze a noisy cost-function market maker price trades according to a cost function, but use a noisy version of the market state to mask the effects of past trading activities.

Before there is a stream of values that depend on a differentiated private way, we must remember that a differentiated streaming algorithm M as input takes a stream of arbitrary lengths and outputs that depend on values that depend on market attitude. The stream corresponds to the sequence of trading x = (x1, x2, x2). We think of the noisy cost function of the market (algorithm 4) as an algorithm."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "The parameters of our mechanisms can be fine-tuned to achieve a trade-off between the guaranteed level of privacy and the sensitivity of a betting provider's payment to their own report. Determining how best to circumvent this trade-off in practice (and more generally, what level of privacy is acceptable in differentiated private algorithms) is an open empirical question.While our results are negative in the dynamic environment, there are several potential ways to circumvent our lower boundary.The lower boundary shows that it is not possible to obtain adequate privacy guarantees using a noisy cost-function marketer when traders can buy or sell fragmentary securities, as is usually assumed in the cost-function literature. In fact, the contradictory trader we consider to be buying and selling arbitrarily small fragments when the market state is close to its goal."}], "references": [{"title": "Efficient market making via convex optimization, and a connection to online learning", "author": ["Jacob Abernethy", "Yiling Chen", "Jennifer Wortman Vaughan"], "venue": "ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation,", "citeRegEx": "Abernethy et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Abernethy et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Hanson\u2019s automated market maker", "author": ["Henry Berg", "Todd A.

These wagers are then collected by a centralized operator and redistributed among bettors in such a way that more accurate bettors receive higher rewards. Lambert et al. [2008] showed that the class of weighted score wagering mechanisms, which are built on the machinery of proper scoring rules [Gneiting and Raftery, 2007], is the unique set of wagering mechanisms to satisfy a set of desired properties such as budget balance, truthfulness, and anonymity.", "startOffset": 61, "endOffset": 2076}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "We focus on cost-function prediction markets [Chen and Pennock, 2007, Abernethy et al., 2013] such as Hanson\u2019s popular logarithmic market scoring rule [Hanson, 2003]. In a cost-function market, all trades are placed through an automated market maker, a centralized algorithmic agent that is always willing to buy or sell securities at some current market price that depends on the history of trade via a potential function called the cost function. We ask whether it is possible for a market maker to price trades according to a noisy cost function in a way that maintains traders\u2019 privacy without allowing traders to make unbounded profit off of the noise. Unfortunately, we show that under general assumptions, it is impossible for a market maker to achieve bounded loss and -differential privacy without allowing the privacy guarantee to degrade very quickly as the number of trades grows. In particular, the quantity e must grown faster than linearly in the number of trades, making such markets impractical in settings in which privacy is valued. We suggest several avenues for future research aimed at circumventing this lower bound. There is very little prior work on the design of private prediction markets, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider privacy for one-shot wagering mechanisms.
