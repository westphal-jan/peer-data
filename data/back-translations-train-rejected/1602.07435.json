In order to elicit heterogeneous agents' private information and incentivize agents with different capabilities to act in the principal's best interest, we design an optimal joint incentive mechanism and prediction algorithm called COPE (COst and Prediction Elicitation), the analysis of which offers several valuable engineering insights. First, when the costs incurred by the agents are linear in the exerted effort, COPE corresponds to a \"crowd contending\" mechanism, where the principal only employs the agent with the highest capability. Second, when the costs are quadratic, COPE corresponds to a \"crowd-sourcing\" mechanism that employs multiple agents with different capabilities at the same time. Numerical simulations show that COPE improves the principal's profit and the network profit significantly (larger than 30% in our simulations), comparing to those mechanisms that assume all agents have equal capabilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 08:56:46 GMT  (248kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07435v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["yuan luo", "nihar b shah", "jianwei huang", "jean walrand"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07435"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.07435.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Parametric Prediction from Parametric Agents", "authors": ["Yuan Luo", "Nihar B.

In order to elicit the truthful information of the participating agents and exploit the heterogeneity of the agents, we propose the mechanism COPE, which ensures that the agents execute the effort desired by the client and report their true observations. Our analysis shows that under the Gaussian estimate noise scenario, it is optimal for the client to recruit several agents to complete the task. We also present the general form of COPE, which is optimal for a variety of settings (e.g. general cost function and sound distribution). In this work, we have focused on the parametric setting, in which the main persons parameterise the parameters (e.g. the winner of an election), where the value can be observed."}, {"heading": "Appendix.

We follow this and show that regardless of the effort an agent exerts, he is always motivated to report his cost parameters correctly. Third, we complete the proof of truthfulness and show that, by truthfully reporting the cost parameters and observing, in our mechanism, an agent always exerts incentives to consider exactly the effort as desirable.

Conditioned on x \u2217, the observations of the agents are assumed to be mutually independent. As a shorthand, we let y = (yn,\u2200n \u2208A) be the observation vector and q= (qn,\u2200n\u2208A) be the effort vector. We further assume that agents do not collude with each other, as each agent submits his observation to the crowdsourcing platform anonymous and does not know the identities of others. It is costly for each agent to exert a high level effort when making an observation, and this cost not only depends on the effort chosen by the agent, but also is affected by the agent\u2019s costtype parameter \u03b8n. The cost types of different agents are allowed to be different, capturing the heterogeneity of the agents. A smaller value of \u03b8n implies a higher capability of agent n. Specifically, we consider a publicly known cost function C : R+\u00d7R+\u2192R+, and assume that the cost incurred by an agent n\u2208A with the cost type \u03b8n when exerting an effort qn is C(qn, \u03b8n). We will study two types of cost functions, i.e., the linear and quadratic cost functions in Section 4.1, and generalize the results to general cost functions in Section 4.2. The cost types {\u03b8n}n\u2208A are assumed to be randomly, independently and identically distributed on support [\u03b8, \u03b8\u0304] for some 0\u2264 \u03b8 < \u03b8\u0304 <\u221e. This distribution is assumed to be public knowledge. In this paper we focus on the case where the distribution is uniform on the interval [\u03b8, \u03b8\u0304]. Uniform assumption has been frequently used in the past incentive mechanism design (e.g., Fang et al.

Conditioned on x \u2217, the observations of the agents are assumed to be mutually independent. As a shorthand, we let y = (yn,\u2200n \u2208A) be the observation vector and q= (qn,\u2200n\u2208A) be the effort vector. We further assume that agents do not collude with each other, as each agent submits his observation to the crowdsourcing platform anonymous and does not know the identities of others. It is costly for each agent to exert a high level effort when making an observation, and this cost not only depends on the effort chosen by the agent, but also is affected by the agent\u2019s costtype parameter \u03b8n. The cost types of different agents are allowed to be different, capturing the heterogeneity of the agents. A smaller value of \u03b8n implies a higher capability of agent n. Specifically, we consider a publicly known cost function C : R+\u00d7R+\u2192R+, and assume that the cost incurred by an agent n\u2208A with the cost type \u03b8n when exerting an effort qn is C(qn, \u03b8n). We will study two types of cost functions, i.e., the linear and quadratic cost functions in Section 4.1, and generalize the results to general cost functions in Section 4.2.
