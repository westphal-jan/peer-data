A particular algorithm, CAPRI, was proven to be the most efficient with respect to sample size and level of noise in the data. The algorithm combines structural constraints based on Suppes' theory of probabilistic causation and maximum likelihood fit with regularization,and defines constrained Bayesian networks, named Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks(SBCNs), which account for the selective advantage relations among genomic events. In general, SBCNs are effective in modeling any phenomenon driven by cumulative dynamics, as long as the modeled events are persistent. We here discuss on the effectiveness of the SBCN theoretical framework and we investigate the inference of: (i) the priors based on Suppes' theory and (ii) different maximum likelihood regularization parameters on the inference performance estimated on large synthetically generated datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 09:23:58 GMT  (4071kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07857v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 22:29:11 GMT  (4178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07857v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 23:40:02 GMT  (4295kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07857v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["daniele ramazzotti", "alex graudenzi", "giulio caravagna", "marco antoniotti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07857"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.07857.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Modeling cumulative biological phenomena with Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks", "authors": ["Daniele Ramazzotti", "Alex Graudenzi", "Giulio Caravagna", "Marco Antoniotti"], "emails": ["daniele.ramazzotti@stanford.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Cancer and HIV are two common examples of such diseases in which the mutation burden in the cancer / virus population increases with time. In these cases, selective pressure is often observed along with competition, cooperation and parasitism between different cellular clones. Recently, we have presented a mathematical framework for modelling these phenomena based on a combination of Bayesian inference and Suppes' theory of probable causal causation, represented in graphic structures called Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs). SBCNs are generative probabilistic graphic models that recapitulate the potential arrangement of such DNA changes during disease progression.

In this study, we are looking at data sets from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (see [29]) for 2 protease inhibitors, ritonavir (RTV) and indinavir (IDV), which contain the first set of 179 samples (see Figure 4) and the second of 1035 samples."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we investigated the characteristics of a restricted version of the Bayesian network called SBCN, which is particularly well suited for modelling the system dynamics driven by the monotonous accumulation of events, thanks to the coded Poset theory of the probable causality of soups. In particular, we showed how SBCNs can generally describe different types of MPN, enabling them to describe a wide range of cumulative phenomena that are not limited to cancer development and HIV drug resistance. In addition, we investigated the impact of the Poset of soups on key performance using cross-sector synthetic datasets. In particular, we demonstrated that suppes \"limitations are effective in defining a partial sequence that takes into account accumulating events, with very few false negatives but many false positives. To overcome this limitation, we investigated the role of two maximum probability regulation groups, i.e., the AIC cumulative parameters and HIV, better predict the earlier AIC and AIC parameters."}], "references": [{"title": "Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle", "author": ["H.

"abstractText": "Several diseases related to cell proliferation are characterized by the accumulation of somatic DNA changes, with respect to wildtype conditions. Cancer and HIV are two common examples of such diseases, where the mutational load in the cancerous/viral population increases over time. In these cases, selective pressures are often observed along with competition, cooperation and parasitism among distinct cellular clones. Recently, we presented a mathematical framework to model these phenomena, based on a combination of Bayesian inference and Suppes\u2019 theory of probabilistic causation, depicted in graphical structures dubbed Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs). SBCNs are generative probabilistic graphical models that recapitulate the potential ordering of accumulation of such DNA changes during the progression of the disease. Such models can be inferred from data by exploiting likelihood-based model-selection strategies with regularization. In this paper we discuss the theoretical foundations of our approach and we investigate in depth the influence on the model-selection task of: (i) the poset based on Suppes\u2019 theory and (ii) different regularization strategies. Furthermore, we provide an example of application of our framework to HIV genetic data highDaniele Ramazzotti Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA E-mail: daniele.ramazzotti@stanford.edu Alex Graudenzi Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication, University of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy Giulio Caravagna School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK Marco Antoniotti Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication, University of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy lighting the valuable insights provided by the inferred SBCN.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
