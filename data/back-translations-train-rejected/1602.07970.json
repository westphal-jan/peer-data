In the ASP language, this can be expressed by increasing the input by dictating edges (X, Y) with weights: edges (X, Y, W) (and similarly for no edges, confusion, and no confusion). Here, the additional argument W represents the weight w (x \u2192 y) given as input. In the following, it is expressed that any conflicting presence of an edge inH and Gu is punished with the associated weight.: edges (X, Y, W), confusion (X, W), tangle (W), W, no edges (W), Y, W (no edges)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Weighting Schemes", "text": "We use two different schemes for weighting the presence and absence of edges in H according to their reliability.

To determine the presence / absence of an edge X \u00b2 Y in H, we perform the independence test: Xt \u00b2 Y \u00b7 Vt \u2212 1. The simplest approach is to use uniform weights based on the estimation result of H: w (e \u00b2 H) = 1 \u2022 e \u00b2 e \u00b2 H, w (e \u00b2 H) = 1 \u2022 e \u00b2 6. Uniform edge weights resemble the search for the hammer cube of H used by Plis et al.

Conclusion", "text": "Our approach considerably improves the state of the art; in the simplest case (subsampling rate u = 2), we expanded scalability by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, our method of managing different or unknown subsampling rates is generalized in a computationally efficient way. In contrast to previous methods, our method can work directly with finite samples, and we presented approaches that optimally restore conflicts resulting from statistical errors. We expect that this much simpler approach will enable the relativization of additional assumptions over the model space in the future. In particular, we plan to use this framework to learn the causal structure of the system timescale from subsampling data when latent time series thwart our observations."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "AH was supported by the Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence in Computational Inference Research COIN (Grant 251170), SP by NSF IIS-1318759 & NIH R01EB005846, MJ by the Academy of Excellence in Computational Inference Research COIN (Grant 251170) and 276412, 284591; and Research Funds of the University of Helsinki.

Previous work has shown that such subsampling can lead to significant errors about the system\u2019s causal structure if not properly taken into account. In this paper, we first consider the search for the system timescale causal structures that correspond to a given measurement timescale structure. We provide a constraint satisfaction procedure whose computational performance is several orders of magnitude better than previous approaches. We then consider finite-sample data as input, and propose the first constraint optimization approach for recovering the system timescale causal structure. This algorithm optimally recovers from possible conflicts due to statistical errors. More generally, these advances allow for a robust and non-parametric estimation of system timescale causal structures from subsampled time series data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
