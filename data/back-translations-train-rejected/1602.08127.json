SUMMARY", "text": "In this thesis, we have proposed a novel hashing algorithm that adopts the auto-encoder model to generate binary codes that geometrically match the data points in the original space. We have used the advantages of modern models for auto-encoders. We have introduced a new objective function that uses the properties of first-order geometric conservation (the Jacobin matrix) and has good properties for noise reduction. We have proven that the Jacobin method of defined function can be used to approximate the tangential space of the manifold of the training dataset and to show how the Jacobin properties can be expressed analytically. Experiments are carried out on three large datasets. The performance of the proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art hashing algorithms, providing the best performance for global image functions and comparable performance for the SIFT feature data sets."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Binary codes can be used to speed up nearest neighbor search tasks in large scale data sets as they are efficient for both storage and retrieval.
