INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do and what they want to do."}, {"heading": "2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW", "text": "Considering a number of input candidates, our goal is to create a search query in which the most important information in their profiles is gathered and search results are retrieved and evaluated based on the query. In the first step, we extract the raw attributes, including skills, companies, titles, schools, industries, etc., from their profiles individually, and then pass those raw attributes on to a query generator. For each attribute type, the query generator aggregates the raw attributes across the input candidates, extends them to similar attributes, and finally selects the top attributes that are most similar to those from the input candidates. After the query is created, it is displayed to the searcher and used to search for results. The searcher can interact and modify the query, for example by adding or removing some attributes such as skills or companies in the query."}, {"heading": "3. QUERY BUILDING", "text": "Considering the raw attributes from the profiles of the ideal candidates, the query builder generates a query with skills, companies, titles, etc. that best represents the ideal candidates."}, {"heading": "3.1 Skills", "text": "In recent years, it has been shown that the number of unemployed people who are able to do their jobs continues to increase. In recent years, the number of unemployed people who are able to do so has doubled. In recent years, the number of unemployed people who are able to do so has doubled. In the last few years, the number of unemployed people who are able to do so has doubled. In the last few years, the number of unemployed people who are able to do so has doubled. In the last few years, the number of unemployed people who are able to do so has doubled."}, {"heading": "3.2 Companies", "text": "In this work, we use the uniqueness of LinkedIn data to find such enterprises. Similar to our approach to finding missing skills, we also use collaborative filtering [5] to harness the \"wisdom of the masses\" to find corporate relationships. Specifically, we construct an enterprise browsemap using a co-viewing relationship (people looking at company A also see company B. Intuitively, companies that are viewed jointly by highly overlapping groups of people are likely to be similar. Given the similarities of the company, the search query respondent includes the current companies of the ideal candidates as well as Top-N-like companies as corporate facets in the search query."}, {"heading": "3.3 Query Building Demo", "text": "Assuming that our team would like to recruit new members, instead of specifying a highly complex query describing the requirement, we can simply take profiles of two team members, Satya Pradeep Kanduri and Ryan Wu, as input into the search system. In the upper part of Figure 3, snippets of their profiles can be seen. Given the two ideal candidates, the query creator automatically generates a query as shown on the left rail in the lower part of the figure, including the job title, skills, company and industry facets. On the qualification facet, the selected represent the core competence of the ideal candidate. The corporate facet includes their current company (\"LinkedIn\") as well as those that resemble LinkedIn, such as \"Facebook,\" \"Twitter\" and \"Google.\" These are the companies that are likely to have candidates like Satya and Ryan. The job title facet features standardized job titles that are extracted from the two profiles. In our system, different search options are selected to enhance the search tech and search system. \""}, {"heading": "4. SEARCH RANKING", "text": "In the next generation of talent search, we propose a new ranking function that takes into account not only the query and the seeker, but also the ideal candidates for input (see Equation 2). The first part of the function (f1) estimates how relevant a result r is to the query q and the seeker s, as in the standard personalized search. The second part (f2) aims to guarantee a direct similarity between a result and ideal candidates for input (IC). However, as the seeker is constantly changing the query, the query may increasingly differ from the original input candidates. Thus, the role of the ideal candidates becomes less important. At the same time, as the search session continues, the fact that the seeker sees attributes and does not remove them increases the confidence that the remaining attributes in the query are useful. Therefore, the importance of the query should increase. To grasp this, we apply a decay function (e \u2212 Numbers) to control the dynamic balance between the query entered and the result."}, {"heading": "4.1 Personalized Ranking", "text": "The personalized ranking feature (f1) combines a variety of signals between a result, a query and the viewfinder. Due to the sensitivity of our companies, we leave out some details regarding the calculation of features. Instead, we give a high-level description of the key feature categories. Expertise Scores For each search result, we calculate the sum of his or her expertise scores, which are described in Section 2.1 about the capabilities in the query. The higher the sum, the better the result corresponds to the information needs in terms of skills. Textual Features These features capture the textual similarities between the query and different sections of result profiles, such as current titles, past titles, current companies, past companies, etc. Geographic Features The talent search on LinkedIn is highly personalized. For example, advertisers in New York City and Montreal are interested in very different results given the same query. Thus, the location plays an important role in personalizing search results. Social features Another important aspect of the personalization of the search results is to capture the common results of the search results."}, {"heading": "4.2 Career Trajectory Similarity", "text": "Different from the keyword-based matching methodology, Career Trajectory Similarity (CareerSim) identifies a similarity between two profiles by using trajectory information encoded in a number of positions held by individual members throughout their careers. Due to space constraints, we focus on the two key steps of the CareerSim framework. Profile Modeling To capture trajectory information, CareerSim models each individual member profile as a sequence of nodes, each of which records all information within a particular position of the member's career, such as company, title, industry, duration, and keyword summary. Similarity Calculation At the node (position) level, similarity is determined by using a generalized linear model, but other approaches could easily be replaced. Then, at the sequence (profile) level, the sequence alignment method is used to find an optimal alignment between the two career paths."}, {"heading": "4.3 Search Ranking Demo", "text": "According to the scenario described in Section 3.3, after the query builder has constructed a query from input profiles, the query is used to retrieve found results. Subsequently, the personalized ranking takes into account the query and information provided by the seeker to evaluate each of the found results. At the same time, the ideal candidates (Satya and Ryan) are also treated as additional input for the CareerSim model to obtain a rating that measures the similarity of career paths between each result and the candidates. Final ranking results based on a combination of the two results are presented in the lower right section of Figure 3. As shown in the figure, the top results are similar to the ideal candidates. All software engineers are of the same age group (\"employees\") and from the same or similar companies (\"LinkedIn,\" \"Google\" or \"Twitter\")."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we introduce the next generation of talent search on LinkedIn: Searching for ideal candidates. Instead of constructing a highly complicated query that describes the criteria of a recruitment position, the seeker simply enters one or a few ideal candidates for the position, such as existing members of the team. Our system automatically builds a query from the ideal candidates and then retrieves the results and ranks them. To create queries, we present approaches based on collaborative filtering to generate skills and facets of the company. For results ranking, we propose a ranking function that combines a personalized search ranking and a career pathway similarity model."}, {"heading": "6. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] L. Ballerini, X.
