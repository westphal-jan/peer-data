Soni and Kumar have studied many types of mutations that solve the problem of a traveling salesman (29). Larra\u00f1aga et al. has conducted a review of the way he presents the problems of the salesman, and the advantages and disadvantages of the various crossover and mutation operators (26). Louis and Tang have proposed a new mutation called the greed swap mutation, so that two cities in the same chromosome are selected, and switching between them when the length of the new tour is reached."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Many researchers have resorted to preventing local convergence in different ways, and because mutation is a key operation in the search process, we have found several mutation methods in the literature. The question is: What is the best method to use? To answer this question, and in the hope of avoiding local optimism and increasing population diversification, we have proposed and implemented several types of mutations that are compared with two of the known types, namely: replacement mutation and rearrangement mutation (40).In the following, we describe each surgeon. It is important to note that mutation methods described in sections 3.4 to 3.10 are specifically designed for the TSP problem, but they can be adapted to fit some other problems, such as the tornister gene problem."}, {"heading": "CHR1: A B E D C A,", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "Multi Mutation Operators Algorithms", "text": "We propose to use more than one mutation operation, and these are the different mutation operators that hopefully lead to different directions in the search space, increasing diversification in the population and improving the performance of the genetic algorithm. To do this, we have chosen two selection approaches: the best mutation and a randomly selected mutation. Choose the best mutation algorithm (SBM) This algorithm applies several mutation operators simultaneously to the same chromosome and considers the best child to be added to the population to avoid duplication; only the best and unfound in the population is added. In this work, we define mutation methods that can be applied from the outset. This algorithm implements all the above methods (WGWRGM, WGWRGM, WGWRGM, WGNM, WGIBNM, RIBRRBRNGM, BRIBRGM, BRIBRGM, each best existing population and another one."}, {"heading": "Select any mutation algorithm (SAM)", "text": "This algorithm tries to apply multi-mutation operators every time. Selection strategy is random and randomly selects one of the above operators of a particular generation. Therefore, we assume that in each generation a different operator is selected for mutations, which means that there is a different direction of the search space, and that is what we aim to increase diversification and try to improve the performance of the genetic algorithm."}, {"heading": "Experiment and Discussion", "text": "In this context, it has to be said that this is a very complex situation, in which it is a very complex, complex, complex and complex situation."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We have proposed several mutation methods (WGWRGM, WGWWGM, WLRGWRGM, WGWNNM, WGWNNM, WGIBNNM, RGIBNNM, SWGLM, IBRGBWGM and IBRGBRGM), in addition to the proposed selection approaches (SBM and SAM). Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate these methods on several TSP problems, which showed the superiority of some of the proposed methods over the known Exchange Mutation and Rearrangement Mutation Methods. The proposed mutations can be used for other problems with some modifications and are not only oriented towards the TSP problem. This study also shows that the use of more than one mutation method in the GA is preferable because it allows the GA to avoid local optimisations; the proposed SBM and SAM strategies improve the performance of the GA. This approach (the use of more than one mutation method in the GA is more effective than the SGA (31), as all of these problems are (31)."}], "references": [{"title": "Exploring Travelling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm", "author": ["A Singh", "R.
