What, then, is knowledge? This is a question that has been discussed by philosophers since antiquity, and it has still not been fully demystified. Drucker P. F. (2011) defines it as \"information that changes something or someone - either by becoming the basis for action, or by enabling an individual (or an institution) to take other or more effective action.\" While the Oxford Dictionary (2015) defines knowledge as \"facts, information and skills acquired through experience or education.\" O'Dell and Hubert claim that knowledge is not knowledge until the information is taken in itself and used by people. And for scientists and researchers in the AI field, it is not knowledge until the information is used within itself."}, {"heading": "THE NEURAL KNOWLEDGE DNA", "text": "The DNA of Neural Knowledge (NK-DNA) is designed to store and represent the knowledge captured by its domain. It is similar in structure to DNA (Sinden 1994): composed of four essential elements. As DNA produces phenotypes, the DNA of Neural Knowledge carries information and knowledge about its four essential elements, namely states, actions, experiences and networks (Figure 1.) The four-element combination of NK-DNA is also inspired by reinforcement teachings and Markov decision-making processes (Sutton & Barto 1998; Michael 2015): States are situations in which a decision or movement can be made or executed; actions are used to store the decisions or movements that the domain can select."}, {"heading": "INITIAL EXPERIMENT", "text": "In this first experiment, the agent is expected to find the shortest way to block Block 8 of Block 1, and the agent will use Reinforcement Learning (Sutton & Barto 1998; Michael 2015) and ANN to learn the labyrinth. First, the states and measures are predefined, for example, there are 8 states, and in first place the agent can either \"go to Block 2\" or \"go to Block 4\" (i.e. the actions of State 1), then the agent will select from State 1 and randomly select an action of his current state to explore the labyrinth as long as it reaches State 8, and the agent will receive a reward for reaching State 8. Meanwhile, the agent will save every single move (i.e. the actions of State 1), selecting the reward from the current state, while exploring the labyrinth as long as it reaches State 8, and the agent will receive a reward for reaching State 8."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed Neural Knowledge DNA, a framework that adapts ideas underlying the success of neural networks to knowledge representation in order to discover, store, reuse, enhance, and share neural network-based knowledge. By utilizing the benefits of neural networks and reinforcement learning, NK DNA stores the knowledge acquired in day-to-day operations and provides an easy way to access, reuse, and share this knowledge in the future. At the end of this paper, we tested our proposal idea in a first experiment, and the results show that NK DNA is very promising for knowledge representation, reuse, and exchange between neural network-based AI systems.For further work, we will do the following: 1) refine and further develop the DeepLearning Engine; 2) further develop the NK DNA framework, in particular to support a range of deep learning frameworks from third-party research; and 3) develop third-party reasoning."}], "references": [{"title": "What is a knowledge representation?\" AI magazine", "author": ["Davis", "Randall", "Howard Shrobe", "Peter Szolovits"], "venue": "Transaction publishers,", "citeRegEx": "Davis et al\\.,? \\Q1993\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Davis et al\\.", "year": 1993}, {"title": "Backpropagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition.", "author": ["Lecun", "Yann"], "venue": "Neural Computation,", "citeRegEx": "Lecun and Yann,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Lecun and Yann", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Knowledge Management Technologies and Applications\u2014 Literature Review from 1995 to 2002", "author": ["S.H.
