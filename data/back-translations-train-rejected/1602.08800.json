Introduction", "text": "This paper was conceived as an application of the multi-stage aggregation method [1] applied by the author to PCA problems in the 1990s. Multi-stage aggregation method was an extension of well-known multigride methods [2] from limit problems to general structural analysis problems, which brought them into the class of algebraic multigride methods.The idea of the aggregation method was to use some naturally constructed course models of the original finite element approximation of a structure that provides rapid convergence for iterative methods for solving large algebraic equation systems.One of the applications of this method was an iterative solution of large eigenvalue problems that occurred in structural natural vibration and buckling analyses.In these problems, a sought-after group of lowest vibration modes can be considered as the main components of structural behavior. An obvious similarity to PCA was a turning point in the search for a suitable aggregation model for data matrix and its use."}, {"heading": "2. PCA problem formulation", "text": "The essence of this method lies in the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) ar Xiv: 160 2.08 800v 1 [cs.N A] of February 29, 2016, which according to the Eckart Young theorem [5] offers the best approximation to the original low-level data. Let n data points be contained in a dimensional space in the data matrix already centered around the origin of computational stability (x1, x2,..., xn) = X (1). Then the covariance matrix A = XXT (2) should be a property pair of A in which eigenvectors terk define major directions."}, {"heading": "3. Aggregation model", "text": "To create an aggregation model, we divide the entire set of data vectors xi into n0 clusters with some similarity criteria in which n0 < < n. We will explain later how we do clustering. We assume that all vectors within the cluster are similar and a single representative of a cluster is a mean of all vectors we call aggregators X0 = XR (4), where we cluster k = 1 / dimk."}, {"heading": "4. Iterative method", "text": "This method is also known as subspace iteration when simultaneously using a series of eigenvectors. (...) An iteration of the power algorithm consists of the following steps: for i = 1 to 1: 1 to 1: 1 to 1: 1 to 1: 1 to 1: 1 to 1: 1 to 1: 1 to 1: 2 to 1: 2 to 1: 2 to 1: 2 to 1: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 2 to 2: 2 to 1: 2 to 1: 2 to 1: 2 to 1: 1 to 1: 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 2 to 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2 to 2: 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 1: 2: 1 to 1: 2: 2 to 2: 1 to 2: 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 2 to 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 2 to 2: 2 to 2: 1 to 2: 2 to 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2 to 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2 to 2: 2: 2 to 2: 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 1 to 2: 1 to 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2: 2: 2 to 2: 2: 2: 2: 1 to 2: 2: 2: 2: 2 to 2: 2: 2: 2: 1: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 1: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2: 2"}, {"heading": "5. Numerical experiments", "text": "For numerical experiments, we used two sets of data. The first value is the total number of terms and the second is the number of documents. We searched for 10 initial eigenvalues of the covariance matrix A = XXT and used 10 clusters to construct auxiliary aggregation problems A0 = X0XT0. Thus, the magnitude of this problem is more than 201 times lower than that of the original problem. The problem is solved with the help of algorithms (10). Figure 2 shows changes in parameters for the first three eigenvectors. As expected, the largest contribution of the projectors (9) is observed in firstings to suppress errors caused by initial eigenvectors."}], "references": [{"title": "Multi-Grid Methods and Applications", "author": ["W.
