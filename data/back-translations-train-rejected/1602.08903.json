According to Theorem 1, semi-stable semantics can share the same mapping (i.e., AF) with a grounded, stable, preferred, complete, and ideal semantics in order to be characterized as a logical programming success. This result argues that all of these argumentation semantics can share the same interpretation of an argumentation framework as a logical program. Certainly, the semantics of logic programming, which is taken into consideration for the characterization of this argumentation semantics, also points to a common interpretation of the reasoning conclusion that is limited to the class of programs defined by AF. We have also shown that the semantics of programming semantics also points to a logical semantics of the argumentation of semantics of the seantics of the seantics of the reasoning of the seantics of the seantics of the seantics of the reasoning of the seantics of the seantics of the seantics of the seantics of the seantics of the reasoning of the seantics of the seantics of the seantics of the seantics of the seantics of the seantics of the seantics of the seantics of the reasoning."}], "references": [{"title": "Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Declarative Problem Solving", "author": ["C.
