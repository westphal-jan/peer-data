Personalization of recommendation algorithms are already common in many areas, e.g., online retail. However, most online routing applications still provide shortest distance or shortest travel-time routes only, neglecting individual preferences as well as the current situation. Both aspects are of particular importance in a multimodal setting as attractivity of some transportation modes such as biking crucially depends on personal characteristics and exogenous factors like the weather. This paper introduces the FAVourite rOUte Recommendation (FAVOUR) approach to provide personalized, situation-aware route proposals based on three steps: first, at the initialization stage, the user provides limited information (home location, work place, mobility options, sociodemographics) used to select one out of a small number of initial profiles. Second, based on this information, a stated preference survey is designed in order to sharpen the profile. In this step a mass preference prior is used to encode the prior knowledge on preferences from the class identified in step one. And third, subsequently the profile is continuously updated during usage of the routing services. The last two steps use Bayesian learning techniques in order to incorporate information from all contributing individuals. The FAVOUR approach is presented in detail and tested on a small number of survey participants. The experimental results on this real-world dataset show that FAVOUR generates better-quality recommendations w.r.t. alternative learning algorithms from the literature. In particular the definition of the mass preference prior for initialization of step two is shown to provide better predictions than a number of alternatives from the literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 18:16:12 GMT  (1221kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.09076v1", "12 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

PROBLEM SETTING", "text": "A personalized, situation-aware route recommendation system determines the user's travel preferences and uses them to advance the search of the underlying route system for a satisfactory route. In this section, both the requirements placed on the learning system by the interaction with the traveller and the structure of the route model underlying the FAVOUR algorithm are described."}, {"heading": "A. Efficient interaction with the travelers", "text": "A personalized, situational route service faces several challenges in terms of interacting with users, stemming from the limited rationality of human decision-making [19]: 1) robustness versus noisy feedback [20], [21]. The typical human decision-making process is characterized by inaccuracy, contradictions, and changes in assessment over time; 2) low user cognitive stress [21], [22], [23], [24]. While users can make qualitative evaluations, such as \"I prefer route A to route B,\" they usually cannot quantify to what extent they prefer route A over route B. Therefore, quantitative user feedback in the context of a traveling information system is not appropriate; 3) real-time limitations [21]. A traveler generally expects an \"immediate\" recommendation from the system after submitting a query. Therefore, proposing new processary routes may take no more than a few seconds to improve the user's perception during the process model."}, {"heading": "B.

FAVOURITE ROUTE-RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM", "text": "As explained in detail in the introduction, FAVOUR uses three stages for the personalization of the weight vector w (hereinafter referred to as the user profile) to encode a user's preferences. In the first stage, general socio-demographic questions are asked to classify the new user into a small number of user classes, for example by separating students from the elderly or workers from the unemployed. For each of these classes, a mass preference model is estimated that represents the average taste in this class. In addition, in the first stage, mobility restrictions are queried that relate to the user's mobility options as well as to important places such as places of residence and work. On the basis of this rough first assumption, preference questions are asked in the second stage in the form of realistic route situations, using the knowledge from the first stage, as is common with personalized route recommendation systems [2], [1]. In this regard, FAVOUR takes simple comparison questions of the type \"Which sectors of these two candidates do you prefer?\""}, {"heading": "A. Learning a utility model from user preferences", "text": "However, the question we asked is advantageous for the calculation of the MPP value in Sec. V.Likelihood model expresses its preferences by comparing the candidate routes in pairs. Therefore, the training group T consists of pairs (rt, qt), t = 1, | T, with the route rt qt (denoted as rt qt) and the probability that they are pairs (rt, qt = 1, qt =), | T, with the route rt qt (denoted as rt qt)."}, {"heading": "V. TRANSFERRING KNOWLEDGE AMONG UTILITY MODELS", "text": "The task of efficiently learning new users is henceforth referred to as a cold start problem. To reduce the number of requests to new users, FAVOUR uses the preferences given by previous users. * The transfer of knowledge between related learning tasks is known in the machine learning community as transfer learning. In this respect, the main idea is that the MPP should code the typical behavior of a given user class in such a way that when new answers from the user class are included in the MPP, this should not be changed, especially the computerized affordable method introduced in [29]."}, {"heading": "VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "The above-described level two algorithm was tested in a real-world case study involving 40 participants, including people of different gender, age, occupational status (students, workers or retirees) and socioeconomic status. Participants are not assigned to different classes, but only one MPP is valued for all participants, despite their heterogeneity. First, the performance of the FAVOUR algorithm, which accepts mass preferences in advance, was compared with the results observed when mass preferences are not previously used. To this end, travel decisions made by a number of real decision makers in realistic travel situations were collected, and the resulting data set is compared in Sec. VI-A and VI-B. Details of FAVOUR implementation are provided in Sec. VI-C, while an alternative non-Bayesian transfer learning approach is defined in Sec. VI-D. The benefit of adopting mass preferences prior to initializing the Uc secretive learning algorithm is provided by FAVR VI."}, {"heading": "A. Realistic travel-choices dataset", "text": "The travel decisions are collected in the form of a specified preference (SP) survey in accordance with current practice in the literature [1], [2]. However, as in the proposed three-step system, the SP questions are personalized for each respondent to make informed decisions. While there are still some concerns about the validity of SP surveys, personalization should improve the results. In our experiment, five route choice situations (RCS) are defined for each respondent. Each RCS contains three alternative routes that are compared by the interviewee. Each of the five situations is replicated with a different setting of weather conditions, so that a total of ten RCS can be tackled by the interviewee. Ternary rather than binary decisions are made in the SP surveys to reduce the total number of questions, while the number of alternatives to be evaluated is low."}, {"heading": "B. Route features", "text": "The constant Umw (r) specific to the routes and the situational context provided to the interviewees is described by a set of binary decision characteristics generated as follows: Each transport mode is associated with an indicator variable, which is set to one when the transport mode is used to cover (part of) the route. As this study includes multimodal routes, various indicator variables can be set to one at the same time. Environmental conditions are divided into six different states, each of which is encoded by a dummy indicator variable. States describe the six possible interaction conditions of the precipitation probability of binary predictions (high probability of precipitation or snowfall) with three different temperature intervals (low, mean and high temperature), each of the six environmental condition variables is combined with the six different transport modes, whereby the binary indicator variables mj (s, s, define, traffic conditions, etc.) are used with specific environmental conditions."}, {"heading": "C. FAVOUR implementation", "text": "The incremental learning component of FAVOUR is implemented in Matlab R2008a. The box-limited optimization task for determining the rear mode and variance is solved by a confidence-regional optimization algorithm based on local square approximations of the non-linear objective function. Indeed, the Hessian matrix is also necessary to generate the covariance matrix for the Laplace Inference Technique. Analytical formulation of the logbook derivatives was provided to the optimization algorithm. Indeed, numerical distinction techniques can generally be unstable and computationally expensive for route recommendations. Although the objective function of the optimization task is unimmodal and therefore a single run of local search algorithms increases the rear mode, robustness w.r.t. numerical inaccuracies are increased by performing five runs of the algorithm."}, {"heading": "D. Alternative transfer-learning algorithm", "text": "For a learning algorithm alternative to that of FAVOUR, we follow the methodology of [7], applying the idea of individual level parameters in mixed Logit models [13]. The use of a route r by the user k with l edges is the same as in Eq. (3) with the same notation: U (r) = Umw (r) + w \u00b7 u (r) In order to enable individual level parameters, we assume a mixed Logit formulation where wj \u0445 N (\u00b5j, \u03c3j) (independent of components) (independent of components) is used. In a first step, the parameters \u00b5j and \u03c3j are estimated using a simulated maximum probability approach. With the sample currently used, the mixed Logit model with too many parameters and model selection methods is used to obtain a better model for average preferences. In this context, a fast, backward variable selection procedure based on the Aikon the AIC-information is applied."}, {"heading": "E. Evaluating the benefit of transfer learning", "text": "The efficiency of FAVOUR is demonstrated by a specific instance that performs a solid validation (LOUO-CV). In each run of cross-validation, a single user is selected as a test user and a mass preference is learned primarily in the remaining 39 (training) users. 30 test user preference examples are divided into five test examples and 25 candidate examples are evaluated within the tests. Five training sets of size 2, 4, 8, 12, 15 are generated by sampling."}, {"heading": "F. Comparison with the alternative transfer-learning algorithm", "text": "To complete the evaluation of FAVOUR, its performance is compared with the alternative algorithm described in Fig. VI-D (to which the acronym ALT refers below).However, the performance of ALT, estimated by using the same LOUOCV method used for FAVOUR, is observed by the dashed curve in Fig. 4. A statistically significant decrease in performance is observed for ALT w.r.t to FAVOUR. The difference is more pronounced in few training examples, while it decreases in the use of additional training information. However, even with fifteen training examples, a performance difference of 2.9% is still observed. To investigate the reason for the differences in performance, the ALT algorithm was re-executed using the MPPs (Sec. V) calculated using the FAVOUR approach as the original user preference model."}, {"heading": "G. Comparison with the state-of-the-art", "text": "Our experimental evaluation is completed by the empirical comparison between FAVOUR and the approach introduced in [1], which is closest to the state of the art. To this end, the approach in [1] is simulated by using a method with maximum probability to generate the weight vector that represents the mass preferences and a vector of values that quantifies uncertainty about the estimated mass preferences, which is used to form the starting point for a Bayesian method that individualizes weights for each test user. Results of the benchmarking approach are measured by the solid curve with the diamond markers in Fig. 4. Superior performance of the FAVOUR algorithm is observed. FAVOUR's predictive accuracy is 5.6 percentage points better in 15 training examples, and the accuracy difference increases to 9.8% when two training examples are used."}, {"heading": "VII.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL", "text": "This section contains additional information that is not included in the main article for reasons of space. In particular, paragraph VIII-A discusses the dispersion of the FAVOUR accuracy values observed during the test sessions. In paragraph VIII-B, the performance of FAVOUR is measured by taking into account the posterior probability values associated with the correct predictions, rather than counting the number of correct predictions (predictive accuracy). This alternative parameter measures the predictive uncertainty of FAVOUR."}, {"heading": "A. Dispersion of observed accuracy values around the mean", "text": "Mean accuracy variation is measured by the Standard Deviation (STD) of the accuracy values. If MPP is used, the STD value decreases by two percentage points from 21% for two training examples to 19% for 15 examples. A similar decrease is observed if transfer learning is not taken over. The initial variation of 23.5% decreases as the number of training examples increases to 20%. Although the variability of the observed accuracy values is smaller when using MPP, the decrease in thedate scattering is not comparable to the increase in average accuracy. When transfer learning is taken over, average accuracy improves by 9% and 8% for two and four training examples. We assume that the scattering of accuracy values is influenced by the small number of training examples used and the limited size of the test set (five examples), which increases the variability of test results across the different sets."}, {"heading": "B. Posterior probability values estimated by FAVOUR", "text": "FAVOUR uses a probabilistic approach to learn user preferences.The estimated usage model of a user is actually a Gaussian distribution derived from the Laplace proximation of the rear (paragraph IV-A. paragraph VI-C explains how to draw conclusions (make predictions) with user usage models. In particular, FAVOUR predicts the probability Pr (r q | u (r), u (q), T) that the test user prefers route r over route q, given the route characteristics u (r), u (q) and training information T. A probability value strictly greater than 0.5 is interpreted as proof that the user prefers route r. If Pr (r q | u (r), u (q), T) \u2264 0.5, the user is expected to choose route q. This probability value estimates the predictive uncertainty of FAVOR's ideal prediction of the situation with FAVOR."}], "references": [{"title": "Adaptive Personalized Travel Information Systems: A Bayesian Method to Learn Users\u2019 Personal Preferences in Multimodal Transport Networks.", "author": ["T.A.

Personalization and situation awareness of recommendation algorithms are already common in many areas, e.g., online retail. However, most online routing applications still provide shortest distance or shortest traveltime routes only, neglecting individual preferences as well as the current situation. Both aspects are of particular importance in a multimodal setting as attractivity of some transportation modes such as biking crucially depends on personal characteristics and exogenous factors like the weather. As an alternative this paper introduces the FAVourite rOUte Recommendation (FAVOUR) approach to provide personalized, situation-aware route proposals based on three steps: first, at the initialization stage, the user provides limited information (home location, work place, mobility options, sociodemographics) used to select one out of a small number of initial profiles. Second, based on this information, a stated preference survey is designed in order to sharpen the profile. In this step a mass preference prior is used to encode the prior knowledge on preferences from the class identified in step one. And third, subsequently the profile is continuously updated during usage of the routing services. The last two steps use Bayesian learning techniques in order to incorporate information from all contributing individuals. The FAVOUR approach is presented in detail and tested on a small number of survey participants. The experimental results on this real-world dataset show that FAVOUR generates betterquality recommendations w.r.t. alternative learning algorithms from the literature. In particular the definition of the mass preference prior for initialization of step two is shown to provide better predictions than a number of alternatives from the literature.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
