With the deployment of deep packet inspection (DPI) in telecom networks, it is possible for the telco operators to obtain user online preference. However, DPI has its limitations and user preference derived only from DPI faces sparsity and cold start problems. To better infer the user preference, social correlation in telco users network derived from Call Detailed Records (CDRs) with regard to online preference is investigated. Though widely verified in several online social networks, social correlation between online preference of users in mobile telco networks, where the CDRs derived relationship are of less social properties and user mobile internet surfing activities are not visible to neighbourhood, has not been explored at a large scale. Based on a real world telecom dataset including CDRs and preference of more than $550K$ users for several months, we verified that correlation does exist between online preference in such \\textit{ambiguous} social network. Furthermore, we found that the stronger ties that users build, the more similarity between their preference may have. After defining the preference inferring task as a Top-$K$ recommendation problem, we incorporated Matrix Factorization Collaborative Filtering model with social correlation and tie strength based on call patterns to generate Top-$K$ preferred categories for users. The proposed Tie Strength Augmented Social Recommendation (TSASoRec) model takes data sparsity and cold start user problems into account, considering both the recorded and missing recorded category entries. The experiment on real dataset shows the proposed model can better infer user preference, especially for cold start users.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 05:20:47 GMT  (815kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00145v1", "10 pages,9 figures, 4 tables"], ["v2", "Fri, 9 Dec 2016 22:06:05 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00145v2", "This paper has been modified and the writing may make reader confused"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages,9 figures, 4 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["shifeng liu", "zheng hu", "sujit dey", "xin ke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.00145"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.00145.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On Tie Strength Augmented Social Correlation for Inferring Preference of Mobile Telco Users", "authors": ["Shifeng Liu", "Zheng Hu", "Sujit Dey", "Xin Ke"], "emails": ["liushifeng@bupt.edu.cn", "huzheng@bupt.edu.cn", "dey@ece.ucsd.edu", "kexin@ctbri.com.cn", "permissions@acm.org."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Providing Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) in telecommunications networks enables telecommunications operators to maintain their online preferences.

We then review the lower matrix factorization models with social networks, taking full account of various recommendations."}, {"heading": "2.1 Social Correlation and Social Strength", "text": "Some researchers focus on the components of social correlation. Anagnostopoulos, Kumar and Mahdian [1] investigate the role that social influence plays in social correlation with two practical experiments: shuffle test and edge reversal, followed by Fond and Neville [10], which present another randomization framework. Leskovec et al. [11] investigate positive relationships such as friendship relationships and negative relationships, e.g. competitive relationships and hostile relationships in online social networks. Xiang et al. [23] go a step further and exclude relationship strength from interaction activity and user resemblance. Due to ambiguous and invisible characteristics, research on social networks are much less than that on-line social networks. [16] focuses on the relationship between telco-users and draws the conclusion that the role of weak ties consists in analyzing the stability of social networks through call duration, the small network overlap of social networks, the many social aspects of social networks, etc."}, {"heading": "2.2 Matrix Factorization and Social Networks", "text": "Matrix factorization is a widely used method in the model-based recommendation of collaborative filtering. First, until the creation of the trust network, there are no social networks involved. SoRec, STE and SocialMF [13, 12, 9] bring the trust network into the loss function of matrix factorization and achieve better performance in relation to RMSE. Ma, Hao and Zhou [14] and Yu et al. [28] consider the discrepancy between social networks and trust networks and improve the SocialMF model by different types of similarity calculation. [27] divide the neighboring groups of users into subgroups because they believe that users would trust different subgroups of users for different domains. However, the trust network used in the previous models contains only Boolean relationships, i.e. a user trusts another user or does not trust another user."}, {"heading": "3. HYPOTHESIS TEST", "text": "Social networks have been studied by many researchers for many years, especially for online social networks, which have been researched in recent years. Correlation between users has already been verified in these social networks, which provide the basis for creating effective tools for achieving better performance. However, the social network, which is built by mobile phones among telecommunications customers, has rarely been studied due to its privacy and invisibility. Therefore, it is worth investigating whether there is a social correlation in the telecommunications network."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Set", "text": "The data set that comes from an operator in a medium-sized city in China. To protect privacy and anonymity, all the data we have received is anonymized by the operator in the pre-processing phase, so that no real user could be traced through records. Call Details Records (CDRs) start in January 2014 and end in June 2015, when on average there are more than 6 million users with around 100 million records per month. Each line in CDRs contains caller numbers, caller number, start time and duration. By grouping the CDRs, the mobile social networks can be derived as a graph G = (V, E), where V is the number of users and E is the number of call connections between users. To eliminate some service numbers, we only maintain the relationship that two users have reciprocal calls between them in 18 months. User preferences are calculated based on PI protocols from January 2014 to June 2014."}, {"heading": "3.2 Social Correlation Inference", "text": "The first part is the sum of all the overlapping categories on one level for two users. In order to reduce the influence of hot popular subcategories and increase the importance of rarely used subcategories while calculating the similarities of user preferences, we update the preference pairs with their tf \u2212 idf values. Since the preference vectors are structured, the similarity between two users must be the weighted sum of the similarities between the two users in terms of their structures and the preference weights associated with overlapped categories. We adjust the method that was introduced in our cases, and decompose the similarity between two users as the weighted sum of the similarities between each corresponding level of the preference vectors. As the deeper layers that provide a finer granularity, they are given a greater weight. For the similarity score between the same users, it consists of two users, it consists of weighted sum of the similarities between the individual users."}, {"heading": "3.3 Social Strength Inference", "text": "To effectively distinguish the relationships in sentence S, we extract information from the call rates during the eighteen months and build a set of characteristics to describe the relationships between users. Here, we focus only on those user pairs in sentence S. Since a phone call has one direction from one to the other between two users, the characteristics we have listed in Appendix A.1. maintain with directed and undirected attributes. With all the characteristics extracted from the call rates, we use the classic Kmeans clustering algorithm to generate three clusters. The reason why we set the K = 3 is that some social experts like Dunbar divide the relationship into three progressive aggregations, i.e. the normal and the marginal, the application pair that records the user ID, and their HierarchySim in preference vector. The reason we divide the relationship into the norms, i.e. the three, the norms, the three, and the norms."}, {"heading": "4. TIE STRENGTH AUGMENTED SOCIAL RECOMMENDATION MODEL", "text": "Unlike traditional social CF recommendation systems, which only take into account the presence of social relationships, social strength is incorporated into our Tie Strength Augmented Social Recommendation (TSASoRec) model, which improves the performance of recommendation outcomes. In training and evaluating user data in our model, we take into account not only the categories that users have visited, but also the categories not visited. This is because the user can visit a category, but the DPI could not be inspected for the above reasons. Based on our TSASoRec, the untracked preferences of people could be identified, which could be used to solve the cold start problem, such as filling in the vacancy of user preference vectors."}, {"heading": "4.1 Preliminaries", "text": "In the recommendation system, we have a set of users U = {u1,..., uN} and a set of predefined categories C = {ci,..., cM}. The probability values expressed by users accessing the predefined categories are given in a non-negative preference matrix P = [Pu, c] N \u00b7 M. In the preference matrix P, Pu, c denotes the possibility that user u accesses a web page that is classified as a predefined category c. Like any Pu, c is the rear probability calculated according to the data sets, so that their values are in the range of [0, 1]. But in the relevant Telco social network, each user u has a predefined Nu of his neighbors and iu, v denotes the value of the social strength of v as a real number greater than 0. Since zero means that there is no call between two users in eighteen months, we consider these two users strangers."}, {"heading": "4.2 Social Strength Assignment", "text": "Both call duration and call times were used in the models to describe the social bonding strength of telecommunications users. Phithakkitnukoon and Dantu [17, 18] use Euclidean Distance of standardized duration and times to define the proximity of users, which is standardized in the equation 4.S (i, j) = \u221a (1 \u2212 F (i, j)))) 2 + (1 \u2212 T (i, j) 2 + (4) F (i, j) is the call time from user i to user, which is achieved with the maximum call times of the user i, and T (i, j) is similarly. From the definition of the proximity that has the closer relationship between two users, the lower value grows with stronger relationships between users. Thus, we define social strength in a similar way to S (i, j): I (i, j) = sensation F (i), j = sensation F (22), j) (22) (i)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Model Training", "text": "Although some recommendation systems proposed a few years ago have already taken into account the social relationships between users, only the marking of whether the two users know each other is not enough. Today, people have formed different relationships among themselves, which means that the degree of mutual affective belonging between people depends on their relationships, i.e. on their social strength. In TSASoRec, the social recommendation is linked to the model of social attachment strength derived from CDR patterns. Using the Network I that it weighs, as defined above, we train a matrix factoring model to generate the ranking of the predefined categories for users. Given the preferences that may be overlooked, we give a little punishment for the categories that are not observed in its preference. Our loss function is similar to that of SoRec [?], but there is a crucial difference in the social network that is optimized via our social."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENT", "text": "In this section, we present test results based on a real dataset to generate the prediction of predefined categories and the impact of sub-parameters. We focus on the topk hit rate or recall as a more realistic measure than the traditional RMSE and MAE [26]. Like the classic social MF models SoRec, STE and SocialMF, we also use rank K = 10, the number of latent features. Unlike the existing experiments on Epinions, which consider only 4 and 5-star ratings relevant, we take into account all preference values greater than zero. This means that even if a user accesses the predefined category only once, we want to take into account whether the user accidentally visits this category or prefers it only at the beginning. In all of our experiments, we set \u03bb = 0.01 and \u03c9 (S) m = 0 because we neglect the situation that two users know each other but do not call each other in eighteen months."}, {"heading": "5.1 Date Set Revisit", "text": "Many social network recommendation systems use Epinion's Dataset or Flixster Dataset, as a collection of data that includes both a social network and ratings, is really hard. Here, we use the data set of preference vectors mentioned in Section 3.1 and the telco social network.The preference portion in the data set is really sparse, as there is a big difference between the average number (7) and the total number (643) of predefined categories. The data set contains 557K users with at least one entry in the preference vector. Here, we consider users with less than 5 predefined categories in their preference vectors as cold start users. With the telco social network in the data set, we have nearly 6.5 million pairs of users who have called each other at least once, forming the Social Relation Matrix, which includes whether two users know each other. We also construct the social bonding strength Matrix using our social strength model and relevant characteristics that are extracted from the data set."}, {"heading": "5.3 Experiment Results", "text": "Figure 5 shows the retrieval values of different k in our dataset using the Social Relation Matrix and the Social Strength Matrix. Parameters \u03b3 are set to 0.01 for experiments in our dataset. Figure 5 shows that the results using our Social Strength Matrix exceed the results of the traditional Social Relation Matrix when k = 5 and k = 10. And the performance of the two matrices is the same when k grows. Our proposed TSASoRec improves retrieval by 2% when k is small compared to the large k in the previous methods. This is quite significant as the recommended content on the phone is limited by the size of the screen, which means that overly high content recommendations are not feasible. In the case of a small amount of content recommendations, our TSASoRec model can lead to better referral performance."}, {"heading": "5.4 Impact of \u03b3 on the Results", "text": "A higher value of \u03b3 in the loss function of Eq.7 indicates that the social strength network has more influence on the loss function. If \u03b3 becomes smaller, the loss function would resemble the traditional PMF model without taking social networks into account. However, if \u03b3 is given a very large value, the model would make the latent feature vectors of users resemble those of their immediate neighbors, thereby disregarding the specificity of users themselves. Figure 6 shows the recall values of k = 5 and k = 10 and they show the same tendency for the effects of \u03b3 on the recall. As shown in the figure, our model shows the best results for \u03b3 = 0.08."}, {"heading": "5.5 Impact of \u03c9m on the Results", "text": "Larger values of \u03c9m in Eq.8 indicate the possibility that users do not access a predefined category they prefer over the phone. If \u03c9m falls to zero, our data show the preferences of users more appropriately and vice versa. We show the results of the recall of k = 5 and k = 10 for a number of \u03c9m in Figure 7. It is clear that performance decreases as an increase of \u03c9m with the most likely probability value of \u03c9m = 0.06."}, {"heading": "5.6 Performance on cold start users", "text": "Some users have a wide range of predefined categories, but they can express only a few because they are not familiar with phones or have difficulty finding the relevant web pages. Occupying vacancies in users \"preference vectors helps operators specify the marketing plan. We consider users who have expressed less than 5 categories as cold start users. Figure 8 shows that the results of cold start users using our proposed social strength model outperform the traditional social relationship one by 4% and one% when k = 5 and k = 10. The gain for cold start users doubles compared to the gain for all users at k = 5, but decreases with k increase. This is similar to what we discussed in the previous subsection. In Figure 9, the performance of cold start users reaches about 50% at k = 5 and outperforms the normal user. We believe that this is mainly due to the consideration of strength in our social model."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "Motivated by the question of whether there is a correlation between the interests of connected users on the mobile Internet in the social network of telecommunications, we sought Call Detail Records (CDRs) and DPI logs of a real telecommunications dataset. We discovered that these are statistically significant for users with call interactions who share more similar preferences than two strangers. On this basis, we further verified that the stronger the call-based social relationship between two users is, the more similar their preferences can be. Based on feature engineering versus features of recorded conversations, we proposed a simple but effective model that describes the strength of the bond between two connected users in which the directed cycle is introduced. We defined the preference inference problem as a top-K recommendation problem and integrated the model with the social matrix factorization CF model to show the strength of the bond between two connected users, in which the directed cycle is introduced. We defined the preference inference problem as a top-K recommendation problem and incorporated the model with the social matrix factorization CF model. The proposed Tie Strength Augmented Social Strategies leads to the improvement of both the calculation of the user recommendation of the top-user as well."}, {"heading": "7.

preference profiles of their customers and connected users, which can help operators make better marketing strategies, and provide more personalized services. With the deployment of deep packet inspection (DPI) in telecom networks, it is possible for the telco operators to obtain user online preference. However, DPI has its limitations and user preference derived only from DPI faces sparsity and cold start problems. To better infer the user preference, social correlation in telco users network derived from Call Detailed Records (CDRs) with regard to online preference is investigated. Though widely verified in several online social networks, social correlation between online preference of users in mobile telco networks, where the CDRs derived relationship are of less social properties and user mobile internet surfing activities are not visible to neighbourhood, has not been explored at a large scale. Based on a real world telecom dataset including CDRs and preference of more than 550K users for several months, we verified that correlation does exist between online preference in such ambiguous social network. Furthermore, we found that the stronger ties that users build, the more similarity between their preference may have. After defining the preference inferring task as a Top-K recommendation problem, we incorporated Matrix Factorization Collaborative Filtering model with social correlation and tie strength based on call patterns to generate Top-K preferred categories for users. The proposed Tie Strength Augmented Social Recommendation (TSASoRec) model takes data sparsity and cold start user problems into Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
