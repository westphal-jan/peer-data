INTRODUCTION", "text": "In my PhD research, I suspected that users \"information needs could be fulfilled to a greater extent through the use of events with high relevance to a particular actor. In our context, this would be an act that takes place in a specific time span. An example would be: Usain Bolt won the gold medal in Beijing. With the availability of beginners who can provide us with precise semantic beginnings, the geographical locations and temporal expanses are discussed."}, {"heading": "2.

This allows us to record frequently occurring events and to link similar events across corpus.In view of corporaD = N k = 1 Dk, where each document d-D consists of the word sequence x with corresponding granularity (e.g. paragraph or sentence): d = n i = 1 xi.In addition, each x-d contains semantic annotations in the form of i. designated units (e), i. geographical location (g) and i. temporal expressions (t).In addition, x also consists of a bag of words W taken from a vocabulary V. Formally represented as: x = < E, g, t, W >"}, {"heading": "3.2 Problem Definition", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to put ourselves in a position to take the lead, \"he said in an interview with the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.\" We have to take the lead, \"he said.\" We have to take the lead, \"he said.\" We have to take the lead, \"he said.\" We have to take the lead. \""}, {"heading": "4. DATA", "text": "On a larger scale, web collections such as ClueWeb '09 [1] /' 12 [2], which are not always accompanied by reliable creation data and many of which are poorly shaped documents, are semantic annotations. Next, text collections such as ClueWeb '09 [1] /' 12 [2] must be commented on. I will explain how to get the various semantic annotations in the following paragraphs. Named entities. In order to decipher named entities in the text with an external source of knowledge such as Wikipedia [37] or an ontology such as YAGO [30] or Freebase [12], and to link geographical entities, geographical entities can be referred to as spatial entities [19]."}, {"heading": "5. EVALUATION", "text": "To test our approach, we need to construct query sets that contain an event description associated with the query; along with participating designated units, geographical locations where the event took place, and relevant time intervals associated with it. I will describe a preliminary approach to achieving this. Test data. To evaluate the accuracy of the various algorithms, I plan to use reliable encyclopedic resources on the web such as Wikipedia [37] or other curated knowledge sources. To make an objective assessment, I suggest the following different sources depending on the algorithm being evaluated. \u2022 Identify important events in a particular year / decade, etc. Pages available on Wikipedia [33]. - Testing of past events can be performed by extracting important topics from category pages on different historical topics on Wikipedia [35]. - Events in the future can be evaluated from key infrastructure projects, technical projects, etc. [These topical events can be extracted from Wikipedia and other Wikipedia sources]."}, {"heading": "6. DISCUSSION", "text": "A key aspect that occurs in the design of the algorithms is that of the calculation models for named units, geographical locations and temporal expressions. What would be the most descriptive mathematical models for each of these semantic notes? Similarity functions: How can we efficiently calculate the similarity between the same types of annotations? Efficiency & scalability: Identification of data structures for indexing corpora along with their semantic annotations so that their asymptotic runtimes scale linearly with the size of the company.Since the evaluation of the solutions outlined is very subjective; what are other reliable sources of objective basic truths? What other metrics can be used to test the effectiveness of our methods?"}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this article, I outlined the research I intend to undertake for my doctoral thesis, which, at its peak, would provide us with methods for computational extraction of world history as a sequence of chronological events and for depicting future events to take place from semantically annotated corpora. Research would also provide pathways for semantic search and large-scale event analysis of these annotated corpora. I also described already available resources that can be used to conduct research; test cases that can be built from encyclopedic resources on the Internet; and the metrics that can be used for evaluation."}, {"heading": "8.
