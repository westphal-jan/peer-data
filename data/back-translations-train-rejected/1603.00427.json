INTRODUCTIONDA's collective of nonlinear signal processing techniques occurs whenever nonlinear effects such as harmonic distortion, saturation, and general polynomial behavior become noticeable enough to worsen the performance of conventional linear techniques. A common problem with nonlinear filters is the computational complexity they require. Some of the most complex filters are based on the Volterra and Wiener models [1] - [3]. It is customary to limit these models to reduce their complexity [4] - [6]. We follow this approach. We propose a polynomial technique that could be considered a subclass of the Volterra and Volterra models. It is based on the representation of the input regressor itself as a crown ressor, but it is already an idea for this size 7."}, {"heading": "II.

SIMULATIONS", "text": "A set of two simulations, cases I and II, were performed on the problem of system identification, with K = 2 and M = 10. Signal d (i) was an SML system plus additive zeromean Gaussian noise with variance \u03c32n (see (16)). The input signal was drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with uniform variance, collected in the ui \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 vector with a delayed line structure. In case I, we chose 2 \u2212 3 and in case II, \u03c32n = 10 \u2212 6. In each case, the algorithm variance was executed with uniform variance."}, {"heading": "VI. DISCUSSION", "text": "Cases I and II clearly show that the system converges to an EMSE of about \u2212 40 dB and \u2212 70 dB, respectively. On both sides of Fig. 2a and 2b, we can see that the SML-LMS runs slower through the first 500 iterations, then accelerates and catches up with the others - and eventually overtakes them. Both the Volterra and Wiener models assume O (M + K \u2212 1K) operations per iteration, while the SML algorithm is only O (KM + K2). Although it is natural that the SML algorithm is better at identifying SML plants, it does so faster and with far fewer arithmetic operations. Note that the SML algorithm represents a richer dynamic than the other algorithms - something that will be examined in subsequent publications. Case III, in Fig. 2c, shows that its behavior does not just depend on the statistics of the regsor."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "By using a Kronecker representation, we have developed the cost function for the SML model, from which the gradient was derived, which motivates a new non-linear adaptive LMS-like algorithm. It has very low computational complexity - an exponential decrease compared to the Volterra series - and competitive mean square performance in a variety of cases, but also some other unusual behaviors. Finally, the SML algorithm, like the Parallel Cascade Filter [15], enables the extension of higher-ranking models. This path will be followed in future publications."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A PROOF OF THE GRADIENT FORMULA", "text": "Through (7) and (8) one can interpret (14) as a tensor equation in the sense that we write the matrices as (RuK) i1,..., iK j1,..., jK = E (u K) i1,..., iKj1,..., jK and (RuKd) j1,..., jK = E (u Kd) j1,..., jKso RuKdw = j1,..., jK (RuKd) j1,..., jK \"(w\") jw, \"where (w\") j \"is the j\" -th coordinate of w, \"and w\" RuKw \"i1,..., iK j1,..., jK\" p \"(wp) ip,\" ip. \""}], "references": [{"title": "Adaptive Nonlinear System Indentification: The Volterra and Wiener Model Approaches", "author": ["T.
