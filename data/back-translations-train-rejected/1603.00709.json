In this paper, we aim to randomly generate relational database benchmarks that allow to check probabilistic dependencies among the attributes. We are particularly interested in Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs), which extend Bayesian Networks (BNs) to a relational data mining context and enable effective and robust reasoning over relational data. Even though a panoply of works have focused, separately , on the generation of random Bayesian networks and relational databases, no work has been identified for PRMs on that track. This paper provides an algorithmic approach for generating random PRMs from scratch to fill this gap. The proposed method allows to generate PRMs as well as synthetic relational data from a randomly generated relational schema and a random set of probabilistic dependencies. This can be of interest not only for machine learning researchers to evaluate their proposals in a common framework, but also for databases designers to evaluate the effectiveness of the components of a database management system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Mar 2016 13:46:31 GMT  (367kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00709v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["mouna ben ishak", "rajani chulyadyo", "philippe leray"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.00709"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.00709.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Probabilistic Relational Model Benchmark Generation", "authors": ["Mouna Ben Ishak", "Rajani Chulyadyo"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Probabilistic Relationship Model, Relational Data Representation, Benchmark Generation"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is a very complex matter, a political project, which is first and foremost a political project."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "This section first provides a brief review of Bayesian networks and relationship models and then introduces PRMs."}, {"heading": "2.1 Bayesian networks", "text": "Bayesian networks (BNs) [27] are directed acyclic graphs allow to efficient encode and manipulation probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces.

The proposed generation process is roughly divided into three main steps: \u2022 The first step generates a random PRM by generating a relational schema using the Generate CPD function (Section 3.2), and then generating a graph dependency structure using Generate Dependency Structure and Determinine Slot Chains Functions (Section 3.3). Finally, conditional probability tables are generated using the Generate CPD function in the same way as Bayesian networks (see Section 2.1). \u2022 The second step illustrates the model generated in the first step."}, {"heading": "3.2 Generation of a random relational schema", "text": "Our goal is to generate a relationship scheme with a certain number of classes, so that it does not contain reference cycles and also respects the definition of the relationship model in Section 2.2. We apply concepts from graph theory to the creation of random schemes. We associate this problem with a process of generating DAG keys, where nodes represent relationships and edges are reference constraints. Xi \u2192 Xj means that Xi is the reference relationship and Xj is the referenced one. We also strive to construct schemes where Xi, Xi and Xi have a reference path between the keys. This assumption makes it possible to search through all classes to discover probable dependencies later, and it is constructed by searching for DAG attributes that contain a single contiguous component (i.e., contiguous key indicators)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Generation of a random PRM", "text": "We must randomly generate probable dependencies between the attributes of the classes in the schema. These dependencies must provide the DAG of the dependency structure S and a set of CPDs that define a PRM (cf. Definition 3).We focus in particular on the random generation of the dependency structure. Once it is identified, conditional probability distributions can similarly be scanned as standard BNs parameter generation.The dependency structure S should be a DAG to guarantee that each generated ground network is also a DAG [14]. S has the specificity that one descriptive attribute can be linked to another, with various possible slots chains. Theoretically, the number of slots chains can be infinite. In practice, a user-defined maximum slot length Dmax should be specified to identify the horizon of all possible slots chains."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Constructing the DAG structure", "text": "The idea here is to find for each node X.A a group of parents from the same class or from other classes, promoting class-internal dependencies in order to control the complexity of the final model discussed in [14]. This condition promotes the discovery of dependencies within the class or dependencies from short class-specific chains. The longer the slot chain is, the lower the chance of finding a probable dependency by the slot chain. To follow this condition, we propose to construct dependencies within the classes, each of which is built by attributes of the corresponding class."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Determining slot chains", "text": "During this step, we must bear in mind that a variable can be reached by different slot chains and that the dependence between two descriptive attributes depends on the attribute selected. [14] Following, the process of creating shorter slot chains must be given more priority for selection. Consequently, we have used the term of punishment discussed in [14]. Longer indirect slot chains are punished by applying the probability of occurrence of a probable \u2212 slot chain list (Pot Slot Chains List), which is inversely proportional to exploration. A dependency X.A \u2192 Y.B between two descriptive attributes X.A and Y.B, we begin by generating the list of all possible slot chains (Pot Slot Chains List) of the length from which X Y can be reached in the relation scheme using the Potential Slot Chains."}, {"heading": "3.4 GBN generation", "text": "The generated scheme, together with the added probable dependencies and generated parameters, results in a probable relationship model. To instantiate this latter, we must imagine a relational skeleton in which there are objects of different classes that are referenced in the associated relational scheme and edges from one object to another that already exists at the meta-level. Indeed, this graph is a special case of k-partite graphs, the graph graph graph graph of the definition Graph 8 of the definition Graph 6 of the relation chain as a special case of k-partite classes is a special case of k-partite graphs, Gk = (Vk, Ek), with the following properties: 1.

Currently, only PostgreSQL RDBMS is supported on this platform. In addition to the algorithms, we have also implemented serialization of PRMs. As there is currently no formalization of PRMs, we propose an improved version of the XML syntax of the ProbModelXML specification 14 to serialize our generated models."}, {"heading": "5.2 Implemented policies", "text": "To generate the relationship schema DAG structure randomly, we use a PMMixed algorithm (see Section 2.1) that generates uniformly distributed DAGs in DAGs space. To obtain this condition along with the interest in generating a uniformly distributed DAG structure, we can use a separate graph, whereas we need a DAG structure that contains only one contiguous component. To obtain this condition, along with the interest in generating a uniformly distributed DAG structure, we follow the rejection technique.The idea is to generate a DAG according to the PMMixed principle, if this DAG contains only one contiguous component, then it is accepted, otherwise it is rejected. We repeat these steps until we generate a DAG structure that meets our condition.Guidelines for generating attributes and their cardinalities. After we have the graphical structure, we proceed by defining for each relationship a R, we define a series of attributes \u2212 A where we create a PMA (a series of attributes \u2212 A)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Complexity of the generation process", "text": "We have reported this work at this stage because it is closely related to the choice of implementation guidelines. Let N be the number of relationships (classes), we report on the average complexity of each step of the generation process. Complexity of the process of generating the relational schema. Algorithm 2 is structured of three loops, the most expensive being the first loop designated for the DAG structure and using the PMMixed algorithm. The time complexity of the PMMixed algorithm is O (N-lgN), which is called until the stop state (i.e., a connected DAG) is reached. Let T be the average number of calls of the PMMixed algorithm. T is the ratio of the number of all connected DAG attributes from N nodes [31] to the number of all DAGs constructed from N nodes [3]. The time complexity of the algorithm is class 2-N (T-O)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and perspectives", "text": "We have developed a method that allows random probability models to be generated and instantiated to fill a relational database. Generated relational data is sampled not only from the functional dependencies of the relationship scheme, but also from the probability dependencies present in PRM. Our method can generally be used by other data mining methods as a probabilistic generative model that allows randomly generated relational data to be generated. Furthermore, it can be enriched with test query components to help database designers evaluate the effectiveness of their RDBMS components."}], "references": [{"title": "Random generation and population of probabilistic relational models and databases", "author": ["M.

essential. In this paper, we aim to randomly generate relational database benchmarks that allow to check probabilistic dependencies among the attributes. We are particularly interested in Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs), which extend Bayesian Networks (BNs) to a relational data mining context and enable effective and robust reasoning over relational data. Even though a panoply of works have focused, separately, on the generation of random Bayesian networks and relational databases, no work has been identified for PRMs on that track. This paper provides an algorithmic approach for generating random PRMs from scratch to fill this gap. The proposed method allows to generate PRMs as well as synthetic relational data from a randomly generated relational schema and a random set of probabilistic dependencies. This can be of interest not only for machine learning researchers to evaluate their proposals in a common framework, but also for databases designers to evaluate the effectiveness of the components of a database management system.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
