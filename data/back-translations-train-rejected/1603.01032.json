However, not only has this theory led to some exhaustive and significant applications in the study of the grammar of immunology, but it also illustrates the nature of the mathematical relationships between chunks, or subsets of a grammar, and language as a whole. This is most evident when it comes to the connection between metalanguage and language, as well as when reflecting on operators. This paper attempts to justify the claim that the sublanguages of science are in an articulate algebraic relationship to the rest of the language in which they are embedded, namely that right-wing ideals are in a ring.
