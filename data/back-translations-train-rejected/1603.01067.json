The corresponding cognitive process, encoded in the brain, is then represented by these meshes each of which is estimated assuming a linear relationship among the voxel time series in a predefined locality. First, we define the concept of locality in two neighborhood systems, namely, the spatial and functional neighborhoods. Then, we construct spatially and functionally local meshes around each voxel, called seed voxel, by connecting it either to its spatial or functional p-nearest neighbors. The mesh formed around a voxel is a directed sub-graph with a star topology, where the direction of the edges is taken towards the seed voxel at the center of the mesh. We represent the time series recorded at each seed voxel in terms of linear combination of the time series of its p-nearest neighbors in the mesh. The relationships between a seed voxel and its neighbors are represented by the edge weights of each mesh, and are estimated by solving a linear regression equation. The estimated mesh edge weights lead to a better representation of information in the brain for encoding and decoding of the cognitive tasks. We test our model on a visual object recognition and emotional memory retrieval experiments using Support Vector Machines that are trained using the mesh edge weights as features. In the experimental analysis, we observe that the edge weights of the spatial and functional meshes perform better than the state-of-the-art brain decoding models.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 12:06:00 GMT  (6690kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01067v1", "13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to JSTSP Special Issue on Advanced Signal Processing in Brain Networks"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to JSTSP Special Issue on Advanced Signal Processing in Brain Networks", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["itir onal", "mete ozay", "eda mizrak", "ilke oztekin", "fatos t yarman vural"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01067"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.01067.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Modeling the Sequence of Brain Volumes by Local Mesh Models for Brain Decoding", "authors": ["Itir Onal", "Eda Mizrak", "Ilke Oztekin", "Fatos T.

After the third math task, a 2-second repetition phase began, in which participants were presented with a test image from the same category and indicated whether the image was a member of the current study list or not.

CLASSIFICATION OF COGNITIVE STATES FOR BRAIN DECODING", "text": "To this end, we use machine learning methods in which the coding of a cognitive state is represented by the training phase and the decoding state corresponds to the recognition phase of a classification algorithm. Then, the main question is how well a cognitive state can be represented by the network? The answer to this question can be observed in part from the performance of the classification process. Remember that for each cognitive stimulus si with a label c we record a sequence of brain volumes, with the number of brain volumes D in this sequence depending on the duration of the stimulus. This sequence of brain volumes is considered a sample with a label c, in the training set. To represent a cognitive state corresponding to a stimulus si with the mesh ensembles, we estimate the edge weights of all local meshes extracted from the corresponding sequence of brain volumes."}, {"heading": "VI.

Analysis of Local Meshes", "text": "In the proposed local models, we assume that the BOLD responses of voxels located in a neighborhood are similar, so that a BOLD response of a voxel can be represented by a linear combination of the BOLD responses of its closest neighbors. In other words, we assume that the error of a linear regression model is small enough to understand how voxels within a neighborhood can behave, and how their behavior differs from the behavior of random voxel sets, we assume a set of randomly selected voxels (Fig. 8a), ii) its ten spatial (Fig. 8b), and iii."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this study, we propose a method that maps a sequence of brain volumes recorded during a cognitive stimulus into a brain diagram that consists of a series of local networks. The proposed model, called the \"ensemble of local networks,\" defines two types of local networks around each voxel, namely spatially local network (SLM) and functionally local network (FLM). While SLM models the relationship between voxel-BOLD responses in a spatial neighborhood system, FLM models the relationship between voxel-BOLD responses in functional neighborhood, which is defined by Pearson correlation. We have observed that we look at the total BOLD responses recorded during a cognitive stimulus for the application of spatial and functional relationships between voxels, so that we can model the discriminatory information in fMRI data. If we represent the brain, we encode FLM characteristics, and we decipher learning algorithms to function better (i.e. the VMR support)."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We thank Orhan Firat, Baris Nasir, Arman Afrasiyabi, Burak Velioglu, Hazal Mogultay, Emre Aksan and Sarper Alkan for insightful conversations and fMRI data collection.

of a set of local meshes. The corresponding cognitive process, encoded in the brain, is then represented by these meshes each of which is estimated assuming a linear relationship among the voxel time series in a predefined locality. First, we define the concept of locality in two neighborhood systems, namely, the spatial and functional neighborhoods. Then, we construct spatially and functionally local meshes around each voxel, called seed voxel, by connecting it either to its spatial or functional p-nearest neighbors. The mesh formed around a voxel is a directed sub-graph with a star topology, where the direction of the edges is taken towards the seed voxel at the center of the mesh. We represent the time series recorded at each seed voxel in terms of linear combination of the time series of its p-nearest neighbors in the mesh. The relationships between a seed voxel and its neighbors are represented by the edge weights of each mesh, and are estimated by solving a linear regression equation. The estimated mesh edge weights lead to a better representation of information in the brain for encoding and decoding of the cognitive tasks. We test our model on a visual object recognition and emotional memory retrieval experiments using Support Vector Machines that are trained using the mesh edge weights as features. In the experimental analysis, we observe that the edge weights of the spatial and functional meshes perform better than the state-of-the-art brain decoding models.
