In 2005, its founder Markus Hohenwarter extended his software development to an open source project. GeoGebra's features (including dynamic geometry, computer algebra, spreadsheets and functional research) focus primarily on facilitating student experiments in Euclidean geometry rather than formal reasoning. The inclusion of automated derivative tools in GeoGebra's Dynamic Geometry System (DGS) could introduce a whole range of new learning and teaching scenarios. As automated theory proof (ATP) in geometry has reached a fairly mature stage, in 2010 some ATP experts agreed to launch a project to integrate and test various automated geometry examiners in GeoGebra. This collaboration was initiated by Toma's Recio. Since the first start of this project, this project has reached the following milestones: 1. Xiw2.

Implementing symbolic equations for various geometric tools (Section 3.1).2. Creating a series of tests to extend the benchmarks (Section 3.2)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Symbolic equations", "text": "GeoGebra's geometry tools were classified by [20, p. 104] as \"easy to use,\" \"medium\" and \"difficult to use.\" Preiner defines two criteria for a simple tool (p. 121): 1. The tool is not dependent on existing objects or only requires existing points that can also be created \"on the fly\" by clicking on the drawing pad. Here, too, the order of actions is irrelevant and no additional keyboard input is required. 2. The tool directly affects only one type of existing objects or all existing objects at once and requires only one action. Again, the order of actions is irrelevant and no additional keyboard input is required. The basic concept in our work was to implement theorem proving functions for the simpler tools in GeoGebra. Also, it was important that the commonly discussed theorems in the classroom can be constructed quickly by using the simpler tools. Theorem proving functions for the simpler tools in GeoGebra may require segments, segments in the classroom, and in the circles, and for some ellipses, and for segments in the circles."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Translating geometry to algebra", "text": "The implementation of angles and cones can have theoretical difficulties in our approach. For angles, we refer to the fact that it is not possible to define only the inner bisector of an angle: we must always cooperate with internal and external angles at the same time (cf. [5, p. 40]). This is a consequence of the handling of angles: there is no way to verify the equality unless one calculates the tangent of them, that is, instead one must check whether one tan (\u03b1) = tan (\u03b2) and these formulas are equivalent only if we set some constraints, say 0 \u2264 \u03b1, \u03b2 < \u03c0. In this sense, we cannot distinguish between 0o and 180o.For cones, ellipses and hyperbolas, we must also be treated as indistinguishable objects, because we must define them with the synthetic approach, and the definitional relations are the same."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 The implemented tools", "text": "Apart from taking these problems into account, we managed to handle many typical classroom situations, and we report that most \"simple\" tools are implemented, as well as some other tools from the \"center\" and \"difficult to use\" toolset.The following basic geometric shapes are now implemented: segment, line, beam and vector, each defined by two points, circle defined by center and passage point or by three points, angle, parabola with focus point and directional trix, ellipse and hyperbola defined by two focus points.
