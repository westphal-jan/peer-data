For example, in the Book of Genesis we find various allusions to older Mesopotamian texts in the Tales of the Flood [Hello, 2003: 458-460]. There are also many instances of inner biblical intertextuality, such as the references to the story of Jacob and Esau in Hosea 1, and of course there are numerous reformulations of the Hebrew Bible in later ancient literature, such as the Genesis Apocrypha and the Book of Jubilees, also called \"Rewritten Scripture\" [Parry and Tov, 2004]. In this article we focus on parallel texts within the Hebrew Bible. There is a lot of literature on this subject, but there is no open source online tool to search for parallel texts and with which it is possible to present these parallel texts synoptically and onlinear."}, {"heading": "2.

Calculations that lead to new results should also be replicable by other scientists. Therefore, it is just as important to publish the data and digital tools as it is to publish the articles that set out and discuss the conclusions. Replicating results obtained through software is generally not easy, as the digital world is in constant flux and all software goes from version to version. To lower the barrier to effective replication, we make sure that our data is properly archived and that our software is available as open source in online repositories with versioning.
