The ability to identify leaders based on their behavior and the subsequent reactions of others opens opportunities to explore how group decisions are made. Understanding who exerts influence provides key insights into the structure of social organizations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful leadership inference framework extracting group coordination periods and determining leadership based on the activity of individuals within a group. We are able to not only identify a leader or leaders but also classify the type of leadership model that is consistent with observed patterns of group decision-making. The framework performs well in differentiating a variety of leadership models (e.g. dictatorship, linear hierarchy, or local influence). We propose five simple features that can be used to categorize characteristics of each leadership model, and thus make model classification possible. The proposed approach automatically (1) identifies periods of coordinated group activity, (2) determines the identities of leaders, and (3) classifies the likely mechanism by which the group coordination occurred. We demonstrate our framework on both simulated and real-world data: GPS tracks of a baboon troop and video-tracking of fish schools, as well as stock market closing price data of the NASDAQ index. The results of our leadership model are consistent with ground-truthed biological data and the framework finds many known events in financial data which are not otherwise reflected in the aggregate NASDAQ index. Our approach is easily generalizable to any coordinated activity data from interacting entities.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 19:04:17 GMT  (5357kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01570v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI", "authors": ["chainarong amornbunchornvej", "ivan brugere", "ariana strandburg-peshkin", "damien farine", "margaret c crofoot", "tanya y berger-wolf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01570"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.01570.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "FLICA: A Framework for Leader Identification in Coordinated Activity", "authors": ["Chainarong Amornbunchornvej", "Ivan Brugere", "Damien Farine", "Margaret C.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "Leadership is an important aspect of the social organization, formation and decision-making of groups of people in online and offline communities as well as other social animals. Understanding the dynamics of emerging leadership allows researchers to gain insights into how social species make decisions. Until recently, it was difficult, if not impossible, to determine a leader's identity from available observation data without explicit additional information. However, the availability of data from physical proximity sensors, GPS and the Web opens up the possibility of measuring leadership in online activities, face-to-face interactions, animal populations and overall social processes such as economic activity. This paper presents an automated method for unattended identification of leader identities in the context of successful initiation of coordinated activities between individuals. The method uses only data on the time series of individual activities, without additional information. The proposed approach automatically determines (1) when a group decision was made, (2) the identity of the leader and the mechanism by which the group declares itself ready to move."}, {"heading": "1.1 Our Contributions", "text": "We propose a general, scientifically based, unsupervised, modular and extendable framework, with few assumptions for identifying people who lead a group to a state of coordinated activity. Our framework is capable of: \u2022 Identifying events of coordinated activity: time intervals of coordination in the group's activity data and the transition periods of decision-making that lead to this coordination; \u2022 Identifying leaders: identifying the initiators of this coordinated behavior, the persons who have managed to lead the group to coordination; and \u2022 Classifying the group leadership model: the type of transitional behavior of the group to coordination according to interpretable, dynamic models (e.g. hierarchical, dictatorial). We demonstrate the framework's ability to analyze leadership in coordinated activities on synthetic and real data sets across multiple domains. We use synthetic simulated data to validate every aspect of the framework."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related Work", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move and to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move, to move and to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "2. METHODS", "text": "Our proposed framework measures \"following\" relationships in multidimensional time series of an arbitrary cardinality and constructs a network model for ranking leaders before and at the time of coordination. Table 1 summarizes all symbols and parameters presented below. Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of our proposed framework. The framework takes as input a collection of multidimensional time series data. The framework first computes (a) time series data suitable for \"subsequent\" relationships (e.g. dynamic time warping, see Section 2.2.1), via sliding windows, and (b) uses these associations to construct a sequence of directed \"subsequent\" diagrams. We (c) model time series intervals of coordination based on density over the time of the graph order. For these intervals, we (d) apply our ranking of leadership actions (e.g. PageRank) to grasp various aspects of leadership."}, {"heading": "2.1 A working example", "text": "Figure 2 is a key example and a brief introduction to our framework. Figure 2 (b) -2 (d) shows the GPS positions of baboons over three different time steps (t = 50, 100, 250); these figures also show the directed \"following\" network and the PageRank of individuals at that time (after node size scaling); the middle diagram shows the density of the \"following\" network over the duration of the entire event; the dashed red lines indicate different intervals of this event based on network density over time.The increase in density corresponds to 1matrices, vectors and sets are denoted by uppercase letters; individual scalars are denoted by lowercase letters; parameters are denoted by Greek letters."}, {"heading": "2.2 Time series analysis", "text": "A multidimensional time series Q is a tuple of cardinality m \u2265 2 of the ordered Q = Q series of observations of length t: Q1 = (q1,1, q1,2,..., q1, t)... Qm = (qm, 1, qm, 2,..., qm, t) (1) Our input data sets D contain n time series of fixed cardinality (each m \u2265 1). Each Q series represents the activity of an entity (e.g. user, individual). The total size of D is then given by [n \u00b7 m \u00b7 t]. In the case of typical geospatial trajectories, m = 2, for latitude and longitude.1 Time series measures and sliding windows Our framework constructs a directed networking by measuring the following interactions between time series. The definition of the \"following\" relationship is the atomic unit determining our network topology and the subsequent guidance analysis."}, {"heading": "2.3 Dynamic association network: inference and analysis", "text": "We construct a temporally varying directed association network on the multidimensional time series dataset D for floating window pair w (k). Let G = (V, E) be a network with node set V of size n and edge set E of size | E |. The nodes are the units represented by each time series Q-D. For (n 2) pairs of time series, we construct a sequence of edge sets Ek using Equation 3 to valid w (k) windows limited by time series length t. Non-zero s (PU, Q) define directed edges to time k, between nodes associated with Q and U. Although here we calculate the paired association network between all time series pairs, our frame trivially generalizes to the case where an explicit network is given in which we measure \"following\" relationships, only for the time series network we know all 3.adjars with all nodes in this 2.adj1."}, {"heading": "2.4 Leadership ranking", "text": "In this section, we propose several methods to measure different aspects of leadership by comparing higher-order network characteristics against individual time series characteristics; these characteristics provide an expandable way to compare different aspects of leadership in the absence of a single, unambiguous leadership definition; in all the analyses below, we compare the ranking of individual time series characteristics; these characteristics provide an expandable way to compare different aspects of leadership in the absence of a single, unambiguous leadership definition; in all the analyses below, we compare the order, which is referred to as the sorted position of each node, to measure the meaning of a node by the number and meaning of the other nodes associated with it; in a network where a connection measures a following relationship between node, PageRank PageRank, how many other nodes follow a particular node, and how many followers those nodes have, etc. It fits well with our definition of a leader."}, {"heading": "2.5 Leadership comparison", "text": "In Section 2.3.1, we describe how we apply the measures described in Section 2.4 to the capture of the recorded coordination events to determine the precedence of each coordination event. \u2022 For node i, we calculate the mean precedence over all time steps in I's pre-coordination interval. We then evaluate nodes based on this value. Note that the mean precedence is affected proportionally to the distance of the mean (e.g. outlier values). Unlike mode (e.g. the most likely precedence of the node), the precedence has considerable noise in the local order, so the precedence is more robust by the expectation. We also define a \"global precedence\" using this method by combining all precedence orders over all coordination events in C, and calculating the mean precedence in the local order."}, {"heading": "2.6 Framework discussion", "text": "2.6.1 Local vs. global linkage Our proposed framework uses local linkages of time histories and subsequences, rather than global linkages, over the entire time series.

Figure 5 (a) shifts the time series to match one of the two \"sequential events,\" forcing an incongruence of the \"following\" event. Similarly, Figure 5 (b) shows a low cost adjustment by shifting the entire time series at constant velocity. By matching only local sub-sequences, we can restore both of these \"sequences.\" 2.6.2 Parameter selection Although the proposed framework has four parameters, the dynamic time distortion of tape \u03b2 and the overlapping window shift of the size of the sequences are."}, {"heading": "3. EVALUATION DATASETS", "text": "We evaluate our framework using four synthetic trajectory models and three real-world datasets."}, {"heading": "3.1 Simulation models", "text": "We develop synthetic trajectory models that capture several hypotheses of movement in relation to guidance. These models are not intended to accurately reproduce the trajectories in our field, nor are they exhaustive of various properties of interest. If one compares real data with model simulations, this results in an interpretable characterization of these data sets. We propose four synthetic models: dictatorship, hierarchy, linear threshold and fixed objective (random) models, we try to identify the top-ranked individuals that we know as down-to-earth labels from the operation of simulation."}, {"heading": "3.2 Synthetic trajectory simulation", "text": "For each of the above models, we generate a study with synthetic data, consisting of 20 individuals and 12,000 time steps in total, with 20 separate coordination events. Each coordination event has pre-coordination and coordination intervals of 200 time steps each. After the coordination interval, another 200 time steps follow a postcoordination gap before the next coordination event begins. We generate 100 studies for each of the above models."}, {"heading": "3.3 Real datasets", "text": "First, we look at biological trajectory datasets derived from GPS and cameras. Next, we look at fifteen years of stock close data from the NASDAQ index. 3.3.1 Baboon trajectories In this dataset, high-resolution GPS collars track 26 individuals of a troop of olive baboons (Papio anubis) living in the wild in Mpala Research Centre, Kenya. [8,34] The data consists of position-length pairs for each person at one observation per second. We analyze a subset of 16 individuals whose collars remained functional over a period of 9 days (419,095 time steps). The task is to automatically detect phases of coordinated group movements and identify the initiator (s) of these time periods, as well as classify the type of guidance mechanisms."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Identifying leaders", "text": "In each simulation, we have the label of the true leader (and select the first person as a \"leader\" in the random model.) For each of the 100 simulation attempts, we set the \"leader\" as the individual with maximum support according to Equation 6. This is the person who comes first among the 20 coordination events most frequently. For each model, we set the threshold for the mean density d (Gk). We specify the \"precision\" as a fraction of the correctly identified guide paths. Table 2 reports on precision across all synthetic model simulations. PageRank performs best in determining the leader of the group across all (non-random) simulation models. This follows our intuition that there is a higher order structure for guide paths where guided paths through the network.Table 2 shows that Velocity Convex Hull (VCH) correctly identifies the leader of group T (Dictatorship Model (DM) and Hierarchical Model (HM)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Identifying leadership hierarchy", "text": "Let's remember that in our proposed Hierarchical Model (HM) we have fixed identities of ranks 1 to 4, which we compare with our top 4 supporters according to different rankings; we report on the same precision as in Table 2 for each rank; Table 3 shows that PageRank ranks even lower in the ranking; let's remember that in the rest of the population, \"followers\" are assigned to high-ranking people proportional to rank; this leads to erroneous edges in the hierarchy \"going up,\" both between leaders and followers; this shows that the overall ranking is robust against these loud edges. We also observe that Velocity Convex Hull (VCH) and Position Convex Hull (PCH) had some performance to regain the best-placed person, but completely fail at lower rankings."}, {"heading": "4.3 Case Study: trained leaders in fish schools", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2 0.93 0 0", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3 0.91 0 0", "text": "We identify the top k leaders from the trajectory data set of fish schools (see: Section 3.3.2), where we have the labels of \"trained\" individuals who should lead the school to feeding places. Table 4 reports on the accuracy of 24 attempts. Similar to the simulation models, PageRank performs best overall, which in turn indicates that the following is better captured in network representation than individual trajectories."}, {"heading": "4.4 Case study: finding leaders of stock market events", "text": "In this context, a \"leader\" measures the extent to which a stock increases or decreases in value in front of a large group of other stocks (e.g. a coordinated group). We apply the framework without particular regard to the range, only to determine that we can detect known events. Figure 7 shows the network density of the derived \"following\" network over time, during which we detect coordination events with thresholds at the 75th percentile of density. Pre-coordination and coordination intervals are shown in red or green. We find significant economic events such as the technology collapse of 2000 and 9 / 11. More interesting is that we detect significant events that are detected in the signal of network density, but not necessarily in the NASDAQ index. For example, we detect a technical econometric event in which the TED spread (an environment of national lending) spreads."}, {"heading": "HM 0.95 1 0.97", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "LT 0.99 0.99 0.99", "text": "In July 2007, the fluctuation range begins, and in August 2011, there is a small market failure.

decision-making in human societies, as well as in the social system of many other animal species. The ability to identify leaders based on their behavior and the subsequent reactions of others opens opportunities to explore how group decisions are made. Understanding who exerts influence provides key insights into the structure of social organizations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful leadership inference framework extracting group coordination periods and determining leadership based on the activity of individuals within a group. We are able to not only identify a leader or leaders but also classify the type of leadership model that is consistent with observed patterns of group decision-making. The framework performs well in differentiating a variety of leadership models (e.g. dictatorship, linear hierarchy, or local influence). We propose five simple features that can be used to categorize characteristics of each leadership model, and thus make model classification possible. The proposed approach automatically (1) identifies periods of coordinated group activity, (2) determines the identities of leaders, and (3) classifies the likely mechanism by which the group coordination occurred. We demonstrate our framework on both simulated and real-world data: GPS tracks of a baboon troop and video-tracking of fish schools, as well as stock market closing price data of the NASDAQ index. The results of our leadership model are consistent with ground-truthed biological data and the framework finds many known events in financial data which are not otherwise reflected in the aggregate NASDAQ index. Our approach is easily generalizable to any coordinated activity data from interacting entities.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
