However, it also poses new challenges in terms of understanding, debugging and managing the complex systems involved. In this paper, we are investigating how causal models [Pearl, 2000, Spirtes et al., 2000] can help address two of these challenges. Note that we are not here aiming to present mature methodology; we are examining how causal models can be applied to different aspects of cloud computing, drawing inspiration from the kind of problems cloud computing generates. We find that a number of concepts commonly used in cloud computing explain concepts directly to concepts from theory of crucial models (in particular counterfactual models and selection diagrams) in our paper, and explain them as contexts."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In fact, we are in a position to go in search of a solution that enables us, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in the position we are in."}, {"heading": "3 Two problems in cloud computing and outline of our approach", "text": "In this section, we will present the two problems discussed in this paper and outline our approaches, which we will then elaborate on in the following two sections.

Performance mapping in computer systems means understanding which component of a system contributes to the measured performance, and to what extent. (Part of the problem is that there are currently no strict and general definitions of many concepts. We hope that with this paper we will also contribute a little to making the definitions stricter, as far as this is reasonable.) Such mapping is often an important step for debugging performance, i.e. for modifying certain system components to achieve the goal of performance improvement. In cloud computing, performance mapping and debugging is not trivial due to the complexity of the system, but crucial: for example, in the case of poor performance of an application running on a cloud server in a VM, you want to understand whether this problem needs to be attributed to the configuration of the VM (which you could change directly) or to the configuration of the server or other VMs on the server (in this case, you may have to purchase meaningful cloud products)."}, {"heading": "4 Addressing problem 1: inferring controllers from experimental and time-varying systems", "text": "Consider the problem in Section 3.1.

We assume the following form of a performance attribution statement: \"Performance Y is y instead of y0.\" This, in turn, is translated into the structural counterfactual probability p (Ydo X = x0 = y0 | x, y, f), with F indicating some potential additional information about the situation in which the above statements are made.

Calculate the approximate pW (YdoX = x \u2032 = y \u2032 | x, y, f) from the GCMM, based on Section 5.2, if H (E | W) is small. Previous approaches [Ostrowski et al., 2011, Snee et al., 2015], which did not use rigorous and explicit modeling and reasoning of the framework, such as causal models, may be prone to make mistakes, such as the distinction between correlation and causal distribution, in certain cases. Furthermore, formalizing this optimization and reasoning with respect to root distribution may be considered uncertain."}, {"heading": "6 Some implementation aspects", "text": "While the paper focuses on the conceptual level, here we will discuss two implementation-related issues: the general problem of measurements on a computer system and an example of what the detailed structure and data of a real system look like.

[2000] to solve control and performance debugging problems in cloud computing or in complex computer systems in general. Ostrowski et al. [2011], Snee et al. [2015] investigate the problem of performance mapping and debugging of cloud systems, but without causal models that can lead to errors, as briefly discussed in Section 5.3. Baah et al. [2010] apply causal models to the debugging of programs, but not of entire computer systems. Bottou et al. [2013], Bareinboim et al. [2015] apply causal models to RL problems, as we do. However, their models are not applicable to the scenario considered in Section 4. For example, they do not address the problem of development and knowledge transfer from a separate experimental (computer system) to the design of controllers."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "This paper translates several important issues from cloud computing into causal consequence terminology, such as selection diagrams and counterfactors. Building on this, we propose methods to derive controllers from experimental and time-varying systems, as well as performance attributions and debugging at the observation level. Our work is only the beginning of what we consider to be a fruitful direction, and leaves several open problems and suggestions for future work. It would be highly desirable to develop tests based on causal and / or probable methods to verify how accurate a model is or whether and what additional measurements should be made. Furthermore, time models should have the potential to be more precise due to strong intertemporal influences in real systems.
