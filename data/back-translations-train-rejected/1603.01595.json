Even if it is a unit, many applications need to determine the opinion on every aspect of the unit. A user can express a positive opinion on the food in a restaurant, but he can have a negative opinion on other aspects such as the ambience. Therefore, we need to identify the aspects and determine whether the mood is positive, negative or neutral to everyone. This task is called Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis or Feature-Based Opinion Mining, as it is called in the early work [Hu and Liu, 2004].In this work we address the problem of sentiment analysis in scientific book reviews. Our goal is to extract the opinion expressed in relation to a book in all its reviews. Therefore, in view of a collection of book reviews, we aim to express the aspects of the book and the mood in relation to each aspect."}, {"heading": "2 French Book Review Corpus Annotation", "text": "To create an annotated corpus of French book reviews, OpenEdition team and we have selected 200 book reviews in French. < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < / \"each word should define the following four elements: 1.

Review Segmentation This step segments each review into sentences. 2. Sentence Tokenizing Each sentence is symbolized to obtain the terms. 3. Sentence Tagging Each term in the sentence should be marked to be presented to a tagging classifier. We select IOB notation to represent each sentence in the review. Therefore, we distinguish the terms at the beginning, the inside and the outside of the opinion goal. For example, for the following review set: \"Mais la m\u00e9thode avec laquelle il present\u00e9 comme seule hypoth\u00e8serecevable pose.\" Where m\u00e9thode is a goal: The day of each word becomes: Mais la: O m\u00e9thode: O laquelle."}, {"heading": "3.1 Experiments and Results", "text": "The first line represents the experiment when only the terms are used as attributes, resulting in an F1 score of 49.5%; the second line, Word + POS, uses the term and POStagging as attributes, which improves results and reaches 61.2%; the third line uses the term, POS tags, types and form attributes, which improve the previous run by 0.3%; the fourth line uses all attributes, including term, POS, form, type and prefix and suffix, which results in 61.5%; so it should be noted that the word and POS attributes seem sufficient to achieve a good result; and the last line shows the results of applying our system to SemEval-2015 restaurant reviews [Rosenthal et al., 2015]."}, {"heading": "3.2 Sentiment Polarity", "text": "For a given set of opinion goals within a sentence, we should determine whether the polarity of each opinion goal is positive, negative or neutral. For example, the system should extract the polarity of the method in the following sentence: \"Mais la m\u00e9thode avec laquelle il est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme seule hypoth\u00e8se recevablepose probl\u00e8me.\" m\u00e9thode: negativeWe propose to use a logistic regression with the following characteristics: - Word-grams characteristics Unigrams, Bigrams and 3-grams are extracted for each word in context, without ancestry or stop-word removal, all terms with an occurrence of less than 3 are removed from the attribute space.- Z-characteristics As described in [Hamdan et al., 2014a], we tested different thresholds for selecting the words that have the highest Z-rating, a grid search in the interval [-2.. 5] with a higher class of 0.5 after we found the best number of the two words in 0.5."}, {"heading": "3.3 Experiments", "text": "The results are in Table 3. The last two lines show the results obtained in applying our system to restaurant and laptop reviews provided by SemEval2015 [Rosenthal et al., 2015] The first line represents the experiment in which only the terms are used as characteristics, giving an accuracy value of 70%. The remaining lines represent the experiments in using the word and Z-Score characteristics, each line represents the same experiment but with a different Z-threshold. We start by assigning 3 to Z-Score threshold and lowering this threshold to -1. The best result is achieved when using terms and Z-Score characteristics with a Z-threshold of -0.5. Accuracy is 79%, which seems fair compared to the results in restaurant reviews (approximately 75.5%)."}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "In recent years, it has been shown that for most of them, who are able to follow the rules, it is not a system, but a system in which they are able to monitor themselves and others.

The results obtained indicate that our systems work just as well as in restaurant reviews."}], "references": [{"title": "Semantic Evaluation (SemEval", "author": ["Hamdan et al", "H. 2015.
