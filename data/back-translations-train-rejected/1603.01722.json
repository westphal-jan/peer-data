INTRODUCTION", "text": "In recent years, we have seen a constant increase in available data resources. As the problem of data availability gradually diminishes, data quality remains one of the most important limiting factors for linked data applications. At the root of this problem lies the openness of linked data approaches. [10] We define our measures of semantic reach as the amount of facts we can derive from a concept, namely the semantic reach of linked data views. [10] We define our measures of semantic reach as the sum of the facts we expect to conclude from the re-use of the data."}, {"heading": "2. PROBLEM DEFINITION", "text": "We define a measurement of semantic wealth as a function that represents a concept \u03b1, such as foaf: Person2, and a linked data graph S, such as the DBpedia graph [1], and returns a positive real number, which quantifies the amount of information conveyed by the concept \u03b1 within the graph S. In other words, it is a measure of how many facts we can expect to infer from the instances of this concept found in the graph. If we quantify (\u03b1, S1) > the amount of information, then we know that an entity of type \u03b1 contains more facts in the context of the graph S1 than S2.In creating such a measurement it is important to take scalability and robustness into account, as there are large differences in the size and quality of linked data resources. It should be possible to calculate this measurement effectively across large amounts of linked data. Furthermore, this measurement should be applicable to any arbitrary data set, even if applicable."}, {"heading": "3. BACKGROUND", "text": "The concept of information content (IC) has been proposed to measure the informaticity of concepts within a taxonomy in the field of information theory [11]. This measurement has proved effective not only in terms of concepts, but also in measuring the informaticity of resources and relationships within a knowledge base [8]. The IC of a concept \u03b1 within a knowledge base is defined as IC (\u03b1) = \u2212 log (\u03b1), where p (\u03b1) is the probability of an entity belonging to the concept \u03b1. One limitation of the applicability of this measurement is that the probability p (\u03b1) could not be meaningful when taking domain-specific datasets into account. Several existing datasets contain only cases of type foaf: Person. The IC of this concept calculated using these datasets will always be zero (foaf: 1). The IC measurement would not distinguish between the different datasets, although they might have a different setical interpretation of the concept."}, {"heading": "4. THE SEMANTIC RICHNESS MEASURE", "text": "Considering a concept \u03b1, such as foaf: Person, we define a measure of its semantic wealth G, which quantifies the amount of information conveyed by the concept. In contrast to IC-based metrics, our measure is not proportional to the probability of an entity being a member of the concept. However, this probability cannot be reliably estimated for linked data due to its open nature and partial observation capability. In evaluating the semantic wealth of a concept, we only assume the availability of a representative subset of this concept obtained from a finite number of sources. Taxonomic information about the concept is not required. Our measurement of semantic wealth G is defined as a function of the number of facts we can derive from its instances and their probability to be correct. These facts are presented, for example, as graphs showing persons with a date of birth: {? Person a foaf: Person foaf: Birthday?"}, {"heading": "4.1 Proof of Semantic Richness Decrease", "text": "Formula 5 can be proved according to our definition of the semantic wealth defined in formula 4. It can be observed that the semantic wealth of a concept is the sum of the individual semantic wealth of each pattern. \u2212 \u2212 0.5 \u2212 0.5 \u2212 0.5 = (2p (i, \u03b1, S) \u2212 1) [p (i, \u03b1, S) > 0.5 |. Therefore, formula 5 can be proved by proving that the inequality applies to each individual pattern. \u2212 0.5 \u2212 0.5 = (1, S1, S2, i) \u2264 1 | G (\u03b1, S1, i) + | 2 \u00b2 (\u03b1, S2, i) | S\u03b12 \u00b2 (\u03b1, S2, i) | S\u03b11 | + | S\u03b11, 2 | 6) After it has been defined, we can define w1 = p (i, S1) and w2 = p (i, S2), then the probability p (i, S2) p (i, S\u03b11, S2) can be defined as the ratio of the number of entries in each pattern."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION", "text": "Once we have defined our model for measuring semantic wealth, we perform an empirical validation of this metric and our hypothesis. This experimental evaluation, carried out over several large datasets, also provides evidence of the scalability of our metric. These experiments are based on the implementation of a system that can select units from a dataset and calculate the semantic wealth of a concept within the dataset."}, {"heading": "5.1 Validation of the Semantic Measure", "text": "Our approach uses a numerical measure of the semantic wealth of a concept using Equation 4. But how well does this measure actually capture the concept of semantic wealth? We evaluate this measure based on the intuition that concepts are, on average, less semantically rich than their subconcepts. A similar property is also found in the IC measure, since the IC of a concept is by definition always inferior or equal to or equal to the IC of its subconcepts.6 To reduce computational complexity, we have evaluated how well our measure of this intuition matches the concepts of DBpedia ontology 5 by calculating the semantic wealth of the entities of each concept.6 To reduce computational complexity, all concepts with over 1000 entities have been replaced by a randomly sampled set of 1000 entities. Also, we only consider simple graph patterns containing a single threefold. Specifically, we consider patterns as pairs < p > concepts that coincide with a concept that is subordinated."}, {"heading": "5.2 Validation of the Hypothesis", "text": "In this experiment5http: / / dbpedia.org / ontology / 6The entities were extracted from DBpedia version 3.5.1we have considered the concept foaf: Person as it is used in 10 different datasets. The list of endpoints used to access the datasets is in Table 1. From each endpoint, we have extracted information about 1000 randomly selected entities. For each dataset, we have calculated its semantic wealth in different states. Starting from the semantic wealth of the original dataset, we have recalculated this measure after adding more and more entities from the other datasets. Figure 2 shows the progressive decay of semantic wealth as we add new entities of the same type from other sources. The semantic wealth of each dataset is quickly converted to a value significantly worse than the average measurement."}, {"heading": "6. RETAINING SEMANTIC RICHNESS", "text": "Since linked data does not allow negation, it is not possible to prevent an entity from becoming a member of a concept. However, it is possible to predict the effect that adding an entity to a dataset would have on the semantic richness of a concept. We define E as the set of patterns that match an entity. The degree of typicity of an entity in relation to a concept \u03b1 can then be defined, which means that the inclusion of an entity in a concept would lead to a reduction of its semantic richness if it is the set of frequent patterns of \u03b1. In the face of two entities and this, we can say that this is more typical than \"if.\""}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION", "text": "This measure differs from earlier semantic measures, such as information content, in that it is intended to compare the difference in the semantic richness of the same concept between different data sets. We have confirmed this measure in relation to the ontology of DBpedia by showing that it captures the expected intuition that sub-concepts are on average more semantic than their superconcepts. We have used the mathematical formulation of this measure to prove our hypothesis that the more a concept is reused, the less semantically rich it becomes. To verify the extent of this problem, we compared the semantic richness of the foaf concept: person from ten different existing data sets. Our preliminary results show that the semantic richness of a concept rapidly decreases when entities of several data sets are merged."}, {"heading": "8. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] S. Auer, C.
