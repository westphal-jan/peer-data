Applications that use it include text analyzers, ontologies (e.g., the Arabic WordNet browser, see Fellbaum et al., 2006), data mining, and content extraction (e.g., ArMExLeR, Lancioni et al., 2013).However, the original version of AM exhibits a number of deficiencies that reduce the reach of the morphological analyzer and impede its applicability to a number of genres and text types. In particular, Buckwalter (2002) focused mainly on contemporary newspaper texts, whereby the analyst underestimates both lexical and morphological coverage - as well as structural selection (by erroneously increasing the amount of ambiguity because the inclusion of historically and linguistically implausible alternatives were taken by the RAM structure)."}, {"heading": "2 Description of XRAM", "text": "XRAM, just like AM and RAM, has a purpose to analyze text, but in a much more defined and thorough way. To improve the accuracy of the analysis, we have implemented a tool that is selectable by flag, adding a complementary field to the Buckwalter analyzer (see infra \u00a7 2.1). After selecting a single flag or set of flags, the text is tokenized according to the text genre and the entire punctuation and formatting structure is removed and factored. Therefore, the program creates a list of tokens that are ready to be processed by the XRAM analyzer, which aims to create a list of possible analyses for each token represented in the original text. Types (unique tokens) are analyzed, and a dictionary of analysis that assigns each type a POS and a lemma is created to reduce computing time."}, {"heading": "2.1 Flag-selectable usage markers", "text": "To make XRAM linguistic analysis even more reliable, markers are provided for graphical, morphological, and lexical characteristics that belong to specific language variants, such as classical Arabic (CA), modern standard Arabic (MSA, formal), and informal colloquial Arabic (ICA, informal), and technical and scientific sub-languages.

A first evaluation parameter is the rate of undetected words depending on the genre of text (see Table 1 above): While the performance of XRAM in MSA texts is slightly better than that of AM, more specific genres exhibit remarkably higher performance due to usage markers and greater lexicon coverage."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "XRAM significantly improves the performance of AM texts, especially for genre-specific texts. It can be further improved by extending the filtering and ranking modules and increasing the lexicon's reach, while minimizing ambiguity through an increasingly sophisticated usage mark mapping.

In addition, other errors that occur with classical Arabic corpora, especially pre-Islamic, concern broken plurals as well as certain verb stems (mainly of, ma\u1e63dars, participles, quadrilitteral verbs, iussive verbs, passives) which are either uncommon, as in the case of the quadrilitteral \u0630\u0630\u0646\u062e\u062a (see Table 1), or are written in a nonstandard form not recognized by the analyzer, for example with the suk\u016bn on the last letter. Note that when dealing with poetry there are other metrical phenomenon that are not recognized by the analyzer such as the \u2018alif or the y\u0101\u2019 followed by the ha\u2019 at the end of the verse to create a rhyme (this was found when inserting the poetical works, or D\u012bw\u0101n, of the pre-Islamic poetess Al-\u1e2aans\u0101\u2019 as a corpus in the analyzer); (ii) the risk of false positives due to the presence of contemporary named entities inside the AM lexical lists, which are included in the search even when a classical text is analyzed (the same point has already been approached and partially overcome within in the above mentioned Boella et al., 2011). On the other hand, for contemporary formal texts among newspapers and novels as well as contemporary informal texts such as blogs and social networks, one of the most important problems is the lack of a graphemic standardization of: (iii) transliterated foreign words that nowadays Arabic borrows especially from English and arranges phonetically according to dialect and idiosyncratic varieties, which influence their transcription2. Among these types there are not only proper nouns of people and places but also commune nouns (for some examples see Table 1); (iv) dialect words which are also exposed to a strong idiosyncratic variety when they are transcribed (for some examples see Table 1).
