INTRODUCTION", "text": "There is a growing interest in techniques for automatically extracting information from text. More specifically, Information Extraction (IE) [1, 2] is a process that takes text as input and puts it into a structured format, unique data as output. The main research directions of IE are named entity recognition (NER) such as (person, organization, location and so on) and relationship extraction (RE) among them. Relation Extraction has developed into an interesting area of research in recent years. It is a very important instance for several applications, such as web mining, information retrieval, answering questions, Social Relations Network and Automatic Summarization. RE is the task of asserting a particular relationship between two or more entities in text. Most relationship extraction systems focus on binary relationships such as (is-a, part-of). The functional relationship can be explicit or implicit relationship to implicit."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "It is. (...) It is. (.) It is. (.) It is. (.) It is. (.) It is. (.) It is.

THE CHALLENGES OF ARABIC LANGUAGE", "text": "The Arabic language [14] is a language that differs syntactically, semantically and morphologically from the Indo-European languages. Research progress in the extraction of Arabic relations is relatively limited, and this limitation may be due, in addition to the lack of linguistic resources available, to the nature of the Arabic language. Indeed, the accessible corpora are not commented on with designated units, and the relationships do not contain a sufficient number of annotated examples that can be used for learning approaches. Arabic is a Semitic language that presents interesting morphological and orthographic challenges that could complicate the extraction of relationships between the NEs. In addition to the problems associated with Arabic NE recognition and relation extraction, some specific challenges listed in [8, 12] include: 1) Multiple relationships between the same NEs may occur. 2) Implicit relations: which are not directly recognized by words in the text and the relations between the elements, 1) they are integrated into the respective element."}, {"heading": "4. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM", "text": "The purpose of the proposed system is to extract examples of binary semantic relationships located in the same line of Arabic text; the system extracts relationships between two named entities (e1, e2); e1 should be a person named Entity and e2 any other named entity; the input into the proposed system is a small instance of the target relationship and the summaries of Google search results as the source text; the output is a list of content relationships, i / e. named entities and the relationship between them. The algorithm of the proposed system is illustrated in Figure 1. The proposed system is an iterative process; each iteration consists of two phases 1) Pattern Extraction, 2) Content Extraction. Each phase is introduced in detail in the following sections."}, {"heading": "4.1.

Input Instances", "text": "Similar to several semi-monitored methods such as DIPRE [20] and Snowball [21], the system starts with a small sample of input entities (e1, e2), with e1 and e2 representing \"named entities.\" In our proposed system, named entities can be person name, book title, organizational name, etc. These initial pairs, which are stored in the input table, are used to begin the extraction of patterns in the first iteration, the initial cases are specified by the user, and it can vary whether a list of four initial seeds is better than one or two or three seeds to detect the many different patterns. Figure 3 shows that the greater the number of seed instances, the greater the number of extracted patterns, as the candidate patterns refer to all patterns with repetition and pattern extraction refers to the patterns without repetition."}, {"heading": "4.1.2. Candidate Pattern Sentences", "text": "The proposed system searches for Arabic texts on the web using seed instances and using the Google search engine. For each input instance (e1, e2), the first 20 top summaries containing the terms e1 and e2 are found. It was found that the results above the 20 summaries do not contain contiguous or repeated results. Therefore, increasing the number of sentences collected over 20 summaries does not affect the number of extracted patterns. Therefore, selecting 20 top summaries is suitable for each pair. Afterwards, all these sentences are downloaded into a text file."}, {"heading": "4.1.3. Preprocessing", "text": "The system deals with sample sentences for candidates line by line. Model sentences for candidates can contain non-Arabic letters and numbers that should be deleted. The pre-processing task involves two steps: normalization and sentence segmentation. Normalization is the process where the text is converted to UTF-8 characters and all punctuation marks and non-Arabic letters are removed. In addition, some Arabic letters are normalized, such as \"away,\" \"her\" and \"her,\" which are replaced by \"her,\" and \"her\" is replaced by \"her,\" \"her\" is replaced by \"her,\" and so on. Closed sentences of Arabic words associated with Internet sites, such as \"free,\" \"page,\" \"download,\" etc.) are inscribed into the components of the sentence."}, {"heading": "4.1.4.

The following criteria are taken into account to extract candidate patterns: 1. Check that the maximum number of the word is one word in each of the two words, then there are only two in each of the two entries."}, {"heading": "4.1.5.2. Pattern Validation", "text": "The purpose of this stage is to remove duplicate extracted patterns. It depends on the similarity between the number of candidate patterns from the previous phase.

A query is generated for extracted patterns that contain both prefix and middle words. Prefix and middle words are used to retrieve the top 20 results for each pattern query. For each pattern, the query of the search string takes the form of: pattern query: \"+ prefix + e1 + middle + e2 +\" For example: \"+ + + + + + + +\" The retrieved instance sentences for each pattern are summarized in a text file. Instance sentences for candidates can contain non-Arabic letters and numbers. To overcome extracted loud occurrences, the output of the search engine is validated against used patterns. It must be processed similarly to procedures described in Section 4.1.3 to remove any noise."}, {"heading": "4.2.2. Instance Extraction", "text": "The system reads extracted sentences line by line from a text file. It uses match method between each pattern and all extracted sentences to extract a new instance pair (e1, e2). Each pattern consists of 5 parts according to the extracted pattern; where prefix, mean and suffix are known, e1 and e2 are required. Finally, the system can detect all potential instances."}, {"heading": "4.2.3. Instance Validation", "text": "The goal of the instance validation level is to filter the list of newly extracted instances, maintain the correct instances, and remove errors that can occur from patterns. Observations after instance validation are that some instances can be repeated many times. Also, in some cases, names of a person of different format can be duplicated for the same second instance, since the name of a person can be written with two or three words, so the goal of this step is to filter the list of extracted instances. Some restrictions have been set to control the new instance generation. Some filter rules have been used instead of using named entities recognition to minimize detection of noise in extracted instances. The purpose of these rules is to evaluate and filter new instances that will be used in the next iteration. These rules are: -1. Remove one of the duplicated instances that are common in the two entities (1)."}, {"heading": "4.3. End Condition", "text": "After adding the results to the instance table, the system eliminates duplication for instances. The system only uses new instances as input to the next iteration if the final condition is not reached. Some other systems can be terminated, many pairs have been returned, as in [20]. In our proposed system, we have decided to stop iterations when they have reached the number satisfactory to the user, or when the total number of extracted instances in the table reaches a threshold of \u2265 \"one threshold,\" which is set to 100 instances. We choose this value to terminate iterations so that we can measure the performance of our system even more easily."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1. Experimental Setting", "text": "In this section we will talk about the text source used and our experiments. The proposed system uses World Wide Web and search engine as text source. In our experiments, all sentences (candidate sample sentences and candidate instance sentences) are extracted from the Google search engine because the data source is open. Our system used Jsoup (Java Web Crawler) [16] to retrieve Google search results. Figure 5 shows the operation that fetches the results from Google. We have performed four relationships to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Four-frequency relationships that are the relationship between author (person, book), president (person, country), player (person, club) and CEO (person, company) relationship. Table 1 shows the sample of initial seed instance for each relationship type. As described above, each system started with only 4 different seed instances for each relationship to achieve a high range of extracted patterns."}, {"heading": "5.2. Assessment Methods", "text": "In order to evaluate the quality of our system, we measured performance using several methods: the first evaluation of the extracted instances to measure their correctness, then the extracted pattern can be evaluated by its ability to extract correct instances."}, {"heading": "5.2.1. Evaluating Instances", "text": "We asked the human judge for each relationship domain (politics, sports, economics, and literature), and they should have good Arabic language skills and knowledge of these domains. We asked human judges to submit a printed form containing the results of extracted instances to assess and rate the accuracy of new instances after they finished iterations, and they evaluated manually using the Internet. For each instance pair, we asked human judges to assign a score of 1 for right, 0 for wrong, and then we calculated numbers of instances (correct - incorrect) for each pattern to evaluate patterns in the next step. As a different relationship, we extract a different number of instances to evaluate the experiment, using three common yardsticks: precision P, recall R, and F-Measure for all extracted instances of each relationship."}, {"heading": "5.3.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS", "text": "In this thesis, we introduced a semi-supervised system to extract binary semantic relationships for Arabic text from the Web. It only took a few seed instances to enter. Google search engine was used as the text source. Our system depended on the pattern-based system. It then extracted patterns with these patterns in the Google search engine to extract new instances. These new instances were filtered to avoid noise. Only new, non-repeated instances are used as input instances for the next iteration. This iterative process was terminated after a total number of extracted instances reached a threshold determined by the user. We conducted four experiments for four relationships to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Four frequent relationships were the author-person-book relationship, president-of (person, country) relationship, playin (person, club) relationship and CEO-of or Chairman (person, company) relationship. Our system was evaluated by four human judges to measure the correctness of the instances extracted."}], "references": [{"title": "Automatic Extraction of Hierarchical Relations from Text", "author": ["T.Wang", "Yaoyong Li", "K.

This research proposes a semi-supervised technique that extracts binary relations between two Arabic named entities from the Web. Several works have been performed for relation extraction from Latin texts and as far as we know, there isn\u2019t any work for Arabic text using a semi-supervised technique. The goal of this research is to extract a large list or table from named entities and relations in a specific domain. A small set of a handful of instance relations are required as input from the user. The system exploits summaries from Google search engine as a source text. These instances are used to extract patterns. The output is a set of new entities and their relations. The results from four experiments show that precision and recall varies according to relation type. Precision ranges from 0.61 to 0.75 while recall ranges from 0.71 to 0.83. The best result is obtained for (player, club) relationship, 0.72 and 0.83 for precision and recall respectively.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
