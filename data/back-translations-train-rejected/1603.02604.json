EMM was developed entirely within the JRC. While the main users are the EU institutions and national authorities of the 28 EU member states, EMM has also been made available to international organisations (e.g. various sub-organisations of the United Nations, the African Union and the Organisation of American States) and the national authorities of selected partner countries of the EU. The first version of NewsBrief came online in 2002, while NewsExplorer came in 2004, but both systems processed smaller amounts of news and had less functionality. EMM currently collects an average of around 220,000 online news articles per day in seventy languages from around 5,000 different web sources (as of May 2015)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Family of EMM news monitoring applications", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to survive on their own, and they will be able to survive on their own if they are not able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "2.3 Multilinguality in EMM", "text": "Reporting on news in 70 different languages is also based on the understanding that reporting on news in different countries and languages complements each other, both in terms of content and in terms of opinions expressed in the media. By gathering and analysing different languages, EMM reduces any national or regional bias and increases coverage of facts and opinions. Many EMM users have special interests such as monitoring events that may have a negative impact on public health (e.g. disease outbreaks, wars and meetings of world leaders are usually also reported in English, but there is ample evidence that only a minority of the minor events are reported in the press outside the country in which the event takes place. Many EMM users have special interests such as monitoring events that may have a negative impact on public health (e.g. disease outbreaks, reports of food poisoning, lack of access to medicines; Linge et al. 2011) or on the stability or well-being of a country (e.g. conflicts between ethnic groups, accidents, crimes abroad, etc.), most of which we do not find news first in the media, etc."}, {"heading": "3 Trend observation and distribution statistics in EMM", "text": "In this section, we would like to give some concrete examples of trend monitoring, as well as bird views of large amounts of media data, which give insight into the relative distribution of news content.The selection of examples shown here is based on a desire to represent different visualization principles or types, but it is also driven by the interests of EMM users, of course. Since EMM monitors large amounts of media reports from all over the world in near real time (timestamps) and tracks the information (e.g. news provenance, news source, publishing language, URL, media type, publication time, etc.), and additionally extracts categories and features (e.g. subject domain; number of related articles; names of persons, organizations, and locations; mood; combinations of features; averages, etc.), it is in principle possible to create and visualize statistics on any combination of features or features. This can be done for a specific time (most EMM users are interested in the current situation, i.e., for any situation)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Bar graphs and pie charts", "text": "The simplest and probably clearest way to present static data is through bar charts and pie charts: Figure 5 shows three different bar charts to visualize different aspects of the same selection of news documents (news provenance, countries mentioned in the articles, and topic areas / units), which give the reader an overview of the entire document collection and thus help him evaluate and categorize the content before reading it in detail.

Figure 5 shows an aggregated map view (number of items per continent / country / region, depending on the zoom level), while Figure 6 shows all message clusters (or those in a selection of languages) that EMM currently sees. Since much map data is available as pre-built levels (terrain, borders, roads, airports, etc.), map visualization can be quite powerful. Figure 8 shows the result of EMM's event detection software, represented by Google Earth.4 All map data in EMM is linked to websites that contain the original news articles along with the extracted meta information, so that users can view live event maps.4, go to http: / / emm.newsbrief.eu / NewsBrief / eventedition / en / latest _ en.html and select the KML output format.
