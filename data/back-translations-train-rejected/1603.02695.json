Each student provides a partial ranking of the courses taken throughout his or her undergraduate career. We compute pairwise rank comparisons between courses based on the order students typically take them, aggregate the results over the entire student population, and then obtain a proxy for the rank offset between pairs of courses. We extract a global ranking of the courses via several state-of-the art algorithms for ranking with pairwise noisy information, including SerialRank, Rank Centrality, and the recent SyncRank based on the group synchronization problem. We test this application of rank aggregation on 15 years of student data from the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Furthermore, we experiment with the above approach on different subsets of the student population conditioned on final GPA, and highlight several differences in the obtained rankings that uncover hidden pre-requisites in the Mathematics curriculum.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 17:29:03 GMT  (432kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02695v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mihai cucuringu", "charlie marshak", "dillon montag", "puck rombach"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.02695"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.02695.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Rank Aggregation for Course Sequence Discovery", "authors": ["Mihai Cucuringu", "Charlie Marshak"], "emails": ["mihai@math.ucla.edu", "cmarshak@math.ucla.edu", "dmontag23@gmail.com", "rombach@math.ucla.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Key words Temporal ranking aggregation, spectral methods, educational data, ranking algorithms."}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Freshman numbers are at an all-time high in American universities [16], and this generation of graduates is choosing to focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).The goal of this paper is to address one aspect of this broad problem through data collection, namely the design of degrees that benefit students.

RELATED WORK", "text": "A popular approach is to adapt e-commerce recommendation systems to the academic space [8, 18, 17], where sequences are gradually determined by comparing students \"records with others with similar course papers and grades. In [19], the authors construct a complicated system that describes how students can navigate through the web of course dependencies. Our approach adapts known ranking techniques to extract a complete sequence of all courses based on the sub-sequences of courses that students have followed within their system. Our goal in this work is to learn the course sequences by studying the flow of students from course to course, as opposed to the above. Our approach adapts well-known ranking techniques to extract a complete sequence of all courses based on the sub-sequences of courses that students have followed. In our approach, the extracted course sequence does not provide an indication of how many courses should be taken per quarter, which courses should and which can be attended simultaneously."}, {"heading": "3. METHODS FOR RANK AGGREGATION", "text": "Rank aggregation is the process of obtaining a global ranking of incomplete and noisy pair-by-pair comparisons [6]. Broadly speaking, there are two important steps in such a ranking process. First, we translate a pool of inconsistent and incomplete pair-by-pair comparisons into a controlled network model in which linkages quantify the strength and frequency of these comparisons. Second, we derive global rankings from a variety of spectral methods that take into account the network's weighted adjacency matrix. Such methods are used to classify professional sports teams based on their exhibitions and, in turn, the results of elimination tournaments [5, 4]. We will not use rankings here to classify individual players, teams or students, but to determine a global order of courses that is most consistent with the data given. Carrying out this analysis on students with high vs. low GPA scores may explain the overall performance of the PA that may have hidden prerequisites to uncover the low students."}, {"heading": "3.1 Network Model and Ranking Constructions", "text": "For our academic application of rank aggregation, we want to extract a global ranking of all courses that is most consistent with the order in which students take them. < < > > Our comparisons are based on the frequency with which the course i was taken before course j. The first step to extract the course sequences is to translate these comparisons into a network model. We present two network models, each of which quantifies the flow of students from course to course. \u2212 In the first network model, each node represents a course, and our edges represent the flow of students between two courses. Let k = 1,.., ns will be our enumeration of students and similar i, j will be courses with i, j = 1, nc. We first define the variable course Ikij as an indicator that student k took before course i."}, {"heading": "3.2 PageRank", "text": "PageRank is designed to \"bring order to the web,\" ranking sites according to the distribution of connections between them [12]. In [4], the authors adapted PageRank to determine the rankings of NCAA basketball teams based on regular season games [4], which in turn enabled the authors to predict the outcome of the NCAA tournament based on the rankings they obtained. This adjustment is a form of ranking aggregation using pair-wise comparisons that are either incomplete (not all teams play each other out) or loud (teams may perform below or above). Using the network determined by P (Section 3.1), PageRank defines a stochastic matrix that describes the movement of a random student who may teleport into non-adjacent nodes [9]. This stochastic matrix S\u03b1 = (1 \u2212 \u03b1) D \u2212 1P + \u03b1nc Inc, the student snake and the student, the snake and the student, the snake and the student, the snake and the snake, the snake and the student, the snake and the snake, the snake and the student, the snake and the snake, the snake and the student, the snake and the student, the snake and the student, the snake and the snake and the snake matrix, the snake and the student, the snake and the snake, the snake and the snake, the snake and the student, the snake and the snake, the snake and the snake, and the snake, the student, the snake and the snake, the student, the pageRank of the snake, the pageRank of the snake, the pageRank of the snake of the snake, the snake and the pageRank, the pageRank of the student."}, {"heading": "3.3 Rank Centrality", "text": "Ranking centrality is designed as a way to determine rankings generated by the Bradley-Terry model [11]. This model assumes that players i and j are assigned latent real weights wi, wj, so P (i beats j) = wi wi wi wi + wj. The authors used this method in turn to classify NASCAR drivers and Indian cricket teams [11]. Also, for our application, we compare courses i and j in which \"beat\" means that course i came before course j in succession of courses. Let P be the matrix defined in the previous section, whose entries Pij denote the number of students who took course i before j, among all those students who completed i and j in different quarters. Ranking centrality defines a Markov chain on the nc courses with the following stochastic MatrixSrc = 1dmax P + (Inc \u2212 1dmax), where the maximum value in the network is max, Inc."}, {"heading": "3.4 SerialRank", "text": "In SerialRank, the authors define a similarity function, which is determined by the results that two players have with common opponents. As such, they study the similarity graph and not a Markov chain, as is the case in the previous two ranking methods. In our academic application, we interpret links as the probability that two courses will be taken at a similar time. To construct the similarity matrix, we remember the matrix P from the previous sections, whose entries are Pij, which counts the percentage of students taking course i before j. We proceed as in [7]. We construct the comparison matrix Ak for course k, in order to be given component by component (Ak) ij = 1 \u2212 | Pik \u2212 Pjk \u2212 Piktor, which K both course i and course j in a sequence with course."}, {"heading": "3.5 SyncRank: Synchronization based ranking", "text": "In [5], one of the authors formulates the problem of ranking with incomplete noise information as an example of the group synchronization problem via the special orthogonal group SO (2), which we briefly describe in detail.

Singer's policy paper [15] considers the angle synchronization problem via SO (2), where the goal is to restore unknown angles of truth, is known as the group synchronization problem."}, {"heading": "3.6 Least Squares", "text": "Another method we are considering for restoring the course arrangements is one based on the traditional approach of the smallest squares. Use m to denote the number of edges in the graph G, m = | E (G) |, which counts the number of pairs of comparisons available, and B to denote the edge-vertex incidence matrix of size m \u00b7 nc, with the entries of Bij = {1 if (i, j), and i > j \u2212 1 if (i, j), (E), and i < j (3) We leave the vector of length m x 1, which contains the pairs of precedence measurements, we use = Fij, for all edges e = (i, j) and E (G). We look at the resulting overdetermined system of linear equations and calculate the least square methods, the x = Fij, for all edges e = (i, j) and E (G)."}, {"heading": "3.7 Ranking via Singular Value Decomposition", "text": "The sixth and final ranking method we are looking at is the most recent SVD-based approach, recently proposed by one of the authors [5] and based on the traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Let r denote the rank vector with ri the rank of the ith player. Applicability of the SVD rank approach stems from the observation that the silent matrix of rank ffsets is defined as before beRij: = ri \u2212 rj is an oblique-symmetric matrix of rank 2 andR = reT \u2212 erT, (5) where e denotes the sole column vector. For a given noise model, it can be shown that R resolves into a low (rank-2) disturbance of a random oblique symmetric matrix [5]. In practice, we do not get access to the clean matrix R of the ranking ffsets, and use as a proxy the available matrix, we consider the second (the two) ranking efficiently given by the top section (the two)."}, {"heading": "4. COURSE SEQUENCE DISCOVERY", "text": "We will now apply the six methods discussed in the previous section to data collected by the UCLA Department of Mathematics between the fall of 2000 and the spring of 2015. First, we will compare the results of each method against all of these student records, and then demonstrate the applicability of this framework by quantifying the student flow from a sequence obtained. After evaluating each method, we will analyze the course sequences of specific student populations to identify some trends. Specifically, from comparing the course sequences of high-performing and low-performing students, we conclude that there are hidden prerequisites, meaning that some courses should follow others, so that students build on their core competence based on a specific sequence of courses. We will briefly discuss the data itself and their cleanup."}, {"heading": "4.1 Cleaning the Data", "text": "In order to apply the ranking methods described above, we need to construct the matrix P or F defined in Section 3.1. We limit our attention to a specific focus, with each focus having its own requirements and objectives. At UCLA, the Department of Mathematics has 7 unique courses ranging from pure mathematics to mathematics & economics to computer science. Since a student can change focus from quarter to quarter, we group students based on the focus they have specified in their last quarter. We also exclude all students in the Community College transfer class, as they often exhibit very different trends from those admitted as freshmen. Moreover, when a student re-takes a course, we only look at the grade and quarter in which the class was last taken."}, {"heading": "4.2 Assessing Rank Aggregation", "text": "This year, it will be able to fix and fix the mentioned bugs."}, {"heading": "4.3 Inferring Hidden Prerequisites", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before a solution is found."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Our results captured easily verifiable dependencies, such as completing courses to calculate the lower division, and then the differences between A, B, and C students within these courses. We applied six different methods of ranking aggregation: PageRank, Rank Centrality, SerialRank, SyncRank, Least Squares, and SVD Ranking. We then compared these methods with a consistency coefficient determined by rankings defined in equation (r). (6) We concluded that the results of all the ranking methods considered were fairly consistent, with the exception of ranking centrality, for which the ranking of a course was affected by a minor role problem."}, {"heading": "6.

Each student provides a partial ranking of the courses taken throughout his or her undergraduate career. We compute pairwise rank comparisons between courses based on the order students typically take them, aggregate the results over the entire student population, and then obtain a proxy for the rank offset between pairs of courses. We extract a global ranking of the courses via several state-of-the art algorithms for ranking with pairwise noisy information, including SerialRank, Rank Centrality, and the recent SyncRank based on the group synchronization problem. We test this application of rank aggregation on 15 years of student data from the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Furthermore, we experiment with the above approach on different subsets of the student population conditioned on final GPA, and highlight several differences in the obtained rankings that uncover hidden pre-requisites in the Mathematics curriculum.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
