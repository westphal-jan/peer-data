Despite the creative potential that exists in the domain of video games, it is not possible to use them on a large scale, even if the games are well suited to exploring the creativity of the players."}, {"heading": "Background", "text": "This theory describes four spaces that make up a mixture: the two entrance areas, each of which projects different approaches to identify equal points, and the corresponding points are projected into a mixing room. In this mishmash, novel structures and patterns emerge, resulting from the projection of objects that lead to creative, novel solutions. Fauconnier and Turner argue that this is an ubiquitous process that takes place in discourses, problem-solving, and in the general design of systems that tend to follow a variation of the four spaces, but also exhibit a wide variety of techniques present in the different spaces (Falkenhainer, Forbus, and Gentner 1989)."}, {"heading": "System Overview", "text": "The goal of our work is to develop a computer system that is capable of creating novel levels of play by mixing different concepts from the game. For example, we want to create a layer of Super Mario Bros. in which Mario floats through an underwater castle. Our system as a whole can be understood as a three-part system that works one after the other. First, our system automatically derives levels from gameplay videos and categorizes these sections according to their characteristics. Second, the system derives probabilistic graphic models from each category. At this point in the process, it can be used to generate levels of play that are closely related but from existing levels of play (Guzdial and Riedl 2016)."}, {"heading": "Model Learning", "text": "Our system learns a generative, probabilistic model of the form for shaping relationships from gameplay videos. Given the focus of this work on mixing, we give here a brief description of the learning process of the model, for more details see (Guzdial and Riedl 2016). These types of probabilistic graphical models, common in the field of object and scene modeling, require a number of similar examples as input. These sets are typically categories of 3D models decided by an inhuman expert. Since the input to our system is gameplay video, we need to (1) determine what input a probabilistic model should learn and (2) how to uncontrollably categorize this input to ensure the required similarity. For the input into our system, we define the level chunk, a short segment of a level. For categorization, we use K as a clustering with K estimated distortion ratio (Pham, Dimov and Nguyen 2005) to learn each category is then used as an input."}, {"heading": "Probabilistic Model", "text": "In fact, most of us will be able to play by the rules we have set ourselves."}, {"heading": "Generation of Novel Level Chunks", "text": "The generation process is a simple greedy search algorithm that tries to maximize the following scoring function: 1 / N \u0445 N \u2211 i = 1 N \u2211 j = 1 p (gi | gj, ri \u2212 j) (1) Where N corresponds to the current number of shapes in a level chunk, gi is the shape at the ith index, gj is the shape at the jth index, and ri \u2212 j is the relative position of gi of gj. This corresponds to the average of the probabilities of each form in relation to its relative position to any other form. The generation process begins with two things: a single shape randomly selected from the space of possible shapes in an L node, and a random N node value to serve as the final condition.The N nodes contain count data of sprites from the original level chunks in a category."}, {"heading": "Blending", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able to assert ourselves in the world, and that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able to stay in the world, \"he said."}, {"heading": "Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we present the results of two different assessments designed to demonstrate the benefits of our system: the first is a human study that shows that our probabilistic graphical model captures people's intuitions about the level design style; the second is a case study that shows that our system's blended models can explain human-made expert blends far better than if the system is not allowed to merge models."}, {"heading": "Model Evaluation", "text": "The first assessment shows that the models learned by our system capture human design intuition. We do this by showing that Equation 1 evaluates the levels of Super Mario Bros. in a similar way to humans. We conducted a study to obtain league tables at the human level, randomly selected from a set of fifteen novel levels. Fifteen novel levels were generated from three generators: the Snodgrass and the Ontan Generator (2014). The Dahlskog and Togelius generators were randomly selected from a set of fifteen novel levels. Fifteen novel levels were generated from three generators: the Snodgrass and the Ontan Generator (2014)."}, {"heading": "Blending Evaluation: Lost Levels", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they have set themselves in order to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "Example Output", "text": "To generate complete levels, our system determines the sequence of L-nodes that best explains the sequence of uniform blocks of a target plane. Each L-node in this sequence is then asked to generate a novel level chunk, and the sequence of generated chunks represents a plane. Figure 8 and Figure 9 represent (according to our system) high-quality levels using a blending target of the world 9-1 and 9-3, respectively. In comparison, we present Figure 10, which represents a low-grade aperture plane, and Figure 11, which represents a high-quality level generated by the complete aperture model. The difference between low and high scoring levels should be evident from their structure, with Figure 10 comprising individual, oddly placed blocks and a floating castle. Furthermore, we identify a lack of differences between the aperture and full aperture models, with Figure 9 and 11 appearing to be very similar in quality, but not showing the generated levels from Figure 9 and 9 are perfect."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we presented techniques to learn probabilistic models from gameplay videos and merge these models into new level types. We conducted a study on human subjects to evaluate the ability of our model to capture level design styles as a measure of structural probability. We found strong evidence of this in the form of a strong correlation between the participants \"style ranking and the rankings of our system. We demonstrated through two case studies that our system is capable of explaining blended levels from human experts and mixing models that evaluate these levels significantly better than the unblended models. Taken together, these represent a system that is able to learn design, evaluate design like a human and is able to expand this knowledge to explain new domains through concept blending."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number IIS-1525967.
