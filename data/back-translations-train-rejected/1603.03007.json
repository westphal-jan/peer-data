However, these phenomena tend to be \"difficult\" for both computer and AI and robotics researchers. Imagine a concierge robot in a hotel checking a fresh loader when a man rushes from Room 317 into a concierge desk desktop and effective human communication is almost impossible."}, {"heading": "2 The Problem", "text": "Instead of implementing the emotional model in a computer system, we reimplemented the neurobiological basis using simulation, in order to create a biologically plausible approach and validate the results of our simulations from a neurobiological perspective. Conversely, we could not provide the correct proof that the result can be considered an emotional phenomenon. We used the model of fundamental mechanisms of a mammalian brain using neuromodulation and its imaging on fundamental affective states [14, 26, 27, 28, 29]. We used realistic spiking neural networks with neuromodulation to reconstruct all brain structures involved in the pathways of neuromodulators of Hugo Lo \u00be vheim's \"Cube of Emotions\" [14]. Unfortunately, current robotic systems generally lack sufficient memory and computing capacity to perform realistic simulations of human brain activity."}, {"heading": "3 Day phase and Night phase", "text": "In order to enable the (soft) real-time behavior of a robot system, it should perform some kind of traditional rules-based control system. We do not restrict the nature or architecture of this system, it could be a kind of Boolean expert system based on fuzzy logic or Bayesian logic and possibly extended to include deep learning pre-processing cascades for visual and / or audio input channels. In our approach, the robot control system should not only generate appropriate responses for input blanks, but also record these stimuli for post-processing during the \"night phase.\" Therefore, we suggest that the robot system record and store all input signals for further post-processing. It could either generate raw inputs (video and audio streams, for example) or store a higher aggregated form such as the deep learning cascade output (if the control system uses such pre-processing mechanisms) and if the robot \"re-connects to the supercomputer,\" all goes to sleep."}, {"heading": "4 Bisimulation", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "5 Related work", "text": "Starting in the late 90 \"s, interest in emotions and emotional representations in computer systems has grown [3, 19, 22, 21]. This increase in activity is based on an understanding of the role of emotions in human intelligence and in consciousness, which has been pointed out by several neuroscientists [7, 6, 18]. Based on the groundbreaking book by Rosalind Picard [20] (although we could mention previous attempts to implement emotions in machines [4], we have identified two main directions in a new field of affective computing research: emotion recognition and re-implementation of emotions in a computer system. There are several cognitive architectures that are capable of re-implementing emotional phenomena to varying degrees, from SOAR [13] and ACT-R [11] to modern BICA [23]. Interest in the implementation of emotional mechanisms is based on the role of emotional coloration in women's assessment, decision-making mechanisms, and emotional behavior."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In our article, we described an idea or approach for extending autonomous robot systems with mechanisms of emotional revision and feedback. There are many open questions: input formats for realistic neural networks, emotional revision thresholds and emotional compensation (homeostasis), etc. On the one hand, different answers to these questions allow the approach to be adapted to a range of possible architectures of robot control systems. On the other hand, an even better solution would be a software framework that implements our approach with multiple plug-in adapters to accommodate the most popular decisions for robots \"brains.\" So our next step is to implement a proof-of-concept for a simple autonomous robot system. We will not immediately start with a concierge Android, but with our current idea to develop a type of robotic vacuum cleaner prototype that will not even clean, but come across humans or pets and receive emotional feedback, for example, because it could be used too loudly or too accurately."}], "references": [{"title": "Affective cognitive learning and decision making: The role of emotions", "author": ["H.
