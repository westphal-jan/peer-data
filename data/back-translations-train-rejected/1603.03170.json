In this context, the main tasks of DARIAH have been set out in such a way that it would be an essential tool to accompany the development towards digital methods in the arts and humanities. More specifically, DARIAH is responsible for the achievement of the following tasks: identifying the infrastructure needs of scientific communities and supporting them; coordinating national contributions in the establishment of sustainable digital services for the arts and humanities; contributing to the preparation of national infrastructure plans; participating in the preparation of the European Agenda for Infrastructure in Europe. To achieve this, DARIAH has set up several organisational instruments: the General Assembly validates the budget and the general organisation of DARIAH; the Scientific Advisory Board accompanies DARIAH in the preparation of its scientific agenda; the national coordinator coordinates the individual countries, ensuring the joint priorities of the individual H."}, {"heading": "A complex membership structure and a complex landscape", "text": "From the initial small group of countries represented in the first phase of DARIAH, the establishment of the ERIC consortium and its submission to the European Union has given impetus to more countries to join DARIAH and the following fifteen founding members: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia. During the first year, two other countries joined, namely Poland and Portugal, as well as five institutions forming Switzerland as associate members.

Therefore, the CHI part of the label would constitute a significant reason for participation in the program. In terms of metadata, free (as in speech and beer) access to document metadata (including document enhancements) would be made available; with respect to images, access to scans of any document or image would be granted on request in accordance with current quality standards; user interaction data would also be provided on 21, e.g. see [Sinn, 2012] and http: / / www.sr.ithaka.org / wp-content / uploads / 2015 / 08 / support-the-changing-research-practices-of-historians.pdf.

Instead, statements such as \"Are the data represented and stored in formats compatible with international standards\" or \"Are the data presented optimally for the long-term readability of the content,\" or \"Does your digital content have PIDs?\" will be the kind of guiding questions that would trigger the DARIAH seal of approval among candidates, guiding them through a set of feasible expectations that allow institutions to achieve a level of security in the re-use of their digital collections, which are both attainable and generally acceptable as well as established practices."}, {"heading": "Data re-use charter", "text": "uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzl uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm uzm urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}, {"heading": "Cultural heritage institutions", "text": "History, mission or focus varies from institution to institution, often taking into account strong regional specificities and legacies, not to mention the impact of history. The Charter aims to look at them in their physical form in the general context of their role as curators of collections and objects. In this context, we consider that cultural heritage institutions could engage in a dedicated course of activity along the following lines: data delivery and services should be in a position where they can describe the means and formats by which they have access to their digital resources. In this context, we look at compliance with international standards and good practices, as well as the fact that they are able to deliver and use the data."}, {"heading": "Researchers", "text": "This charter aims to establish a direct relationship between scientists, CHIs and hosting infrastructures, which is why scientists could, or even should, sign the charter, regardless of the institution they work for. Since we cannot expect scientists to have the technical or human skills to implement a large group of people and institutions, we would limit the required commitment to the following aspects: compliance must be certified in all cases that they have the technical or human skills to implement the charter, and because we want to involve as large a group of people and institutions as possible."}, {"heading": "Data hosting infrastructures", "text": "Primary data may be hosted by CHIs or Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) such as universities, but in many cases they are curated by dedicated data hosting facilities, as we have already seen in this paper. In addition to CHIs and academics, these institutions are equal partners in the Charter. They play a key role in ensuring the stability, visibility and long-term availability of primary data. The engagement we expect for hosting facilities is much more technical and should ensure a concrete implementation of the CHI-researcher relationship. For example, we can envisage the following: a correct definition of the scope of the hosting facility in terms of data types, accepted or required formats, additional descriptors (metadata) attached to the datasets; additional core services that are offered, especially from the point of view of maintaining content: Long-term archiving, permanent identifiers, proper helpdesk formats, etc.; additional core services that will be served by researchers, particularly from the perspective of maintaining content: Long-term archiving, durable identifiers, proper helpdesk formats, etc. (Access to the archive, Sustainability for the public)."}, {"heading": "Stakeholder inclusion", "text": "However, the drafting and description of the content of such a charter will only be a precursor to ensuring that significant stakeholders are identified and enabled to actively participate in the process. Beyond the DARIAH members themselves, with the prospect of national recognition for this charter, we need to involve various transnational initiatives in the library (LIBER, IFLA), archive (ICA) or academic fields (ADHO, EADH). Large aggregations such as Europeana would also need to engage at an early stage, along with specific flagship collection institutions that could be potential early signatories. We should also ensure that smaller institutions such as regional historical archives are involved in the initial discussions so that they can also express their specific limitations, which may differ from more national realities."}, {"heading": "Certification platforms", "text": "It is indeed the case that we are able to set out in search of new paths to follow in order to achieve our objectives."}, {"heading": "Ambitions for digital scholarship", "text": "As a whole, DARIAH is not just an administrative organisation, coupled with a few European projects that feed its work plan; since its inception, it has reflected the enormous digital revolution taking place in the humanities, which must be accompanied by strong coordination between all actors, and it has developed its roadmap on this basis. Such a vision requires the continuous identification of the missing elements in the landscape, the stumbling blocks that still constitute obstacles for the humanities to fully embrace the digital transition. In the context of this article, we have highlighted a number of areas where we believe it is possible, thanks to the presence and capabilities of an infrastructure such as DARIAH on32This is indeed an important problem that we see on the humanities and social sciences side, to initiate a profound change in practices in digital science."}], "references": [{"title": "Comparing Repository Types - Challenges and Barriers for Subject-Based Repositories, Research Repositories, National Repository Systems and Institutional Repositories in Serving Scholarly Communication.", "author": ["Armbruster", "Chris", "Laurent Romary"], "venue": "International Journal of Digital Library Systems,", "citeRegEx": "Armbruster et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Armbruster et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "EPISCIENCES - an overlay publication platform", "author": ["Blanke Tobias", "Conny Kristel", "Laurent Romary"], "venue": "Dr. Panayiota Polydoratou.
