They have difficulty or inability to perform redundant tasks such as bathing, feeding; perform basic actions (getting up, moving); communicate (speaking, listening).The concept of smart home allows our seniors to continue to live as well as possible while staying at home free without changing their habits. Their own home is important because they have habits and memories. In addition, people live in better health (physical & psychological) at home rather than being in the home of the elderly and it is much more economical. This is why resources are currently organizing to keep our seniors at home. Thanks to new technologies, smart home enables notification of abnormal situations such as fall, malaise or abnormal behavior and locate the person (s) when he or she is outside his or her garden. Recognition and evaluation of human behavior, activities and interactions with objects in a smart home is still an open problem."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "The functional tasks in the daily life of elderly people are divided into two parts, ADLs and IADLs (Msahli et al., 2014) and (Lemlouma et al., 2013). The activities of daily life (ADL) are the basic tasks of daily life, such as eating, bathing, dressing, walking, toilets and transferring. The instrumental activities of daily life (IADLs) are the activities that people do since they are awake, such as doing homework, making phone calls, etc. In this part, we examine the related work of language used to describe ADLs and IADLs of older people, exactly the language used to predict a person's scenario. A recognition language is used to define a set of scenarios to recognize the person's behavior. Many researchers propose languages to recognize human behavior in a smart home. In (Neyatia et al), the authors propose a specific language: Human Behavior Language to describe human behavior in a scenario (HBa)."}, {"heading": "3 PROPOSED MODEL", "text": "Our study focuses on a particular type of inhabitant who is older in order to provide him with the necessary help and support. Scenarios considered include: the behavior of the person, the interaction with the system and surrounding objects, and the degree of dependence of the person. These scenarios take into account the limitations and difficulties that the inhabitant may face, his daily life. We define a scenario as a series of activities carried out by the elderly person. The actions considered are those carried out in relation to the system, such as: Off, On, Alarm, Warning. It is necessary to use an efficient model to detect the scenario of the elderly person. Most previous work was based on the Markov model as a model for detecting the activities of elderly people in a smart home. Unfortunately, these models focus on certain events. For example, we focus (Singla et al., 2008) and (Kang et al., 2010) on the \"Preparing Diner Activities.\" Given the good results achieved with the Markov model, we will select the main emergency response to identify as possible for specific activities."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Hierarchical Markov Models", "text": "This paper deals with the problem of studying and detecting human activities of daily life (ADL), which is an important research problem in building a ubiquitous and intelligent environment. In dealing with ADL, we argue that it is beneficial to exploit both the inherent hierarchical organization of activities and their typical duration. The Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) is an extension of the Hidden Markov Model by a hierarchy of hidden states for detecting complex actions. This model consists of a multi-layered structure of the Markov Models (MM). At the top level (the parent level), each state activates a different MM at the child level. In this study, we propose to use the HHMM, a rich stochastic model that has recently been expanded to include divided structures to represent and detect a number of complex indoor activities. The advantages of hierarchical detection are: simplification of different levels of detection by predicting indoor HM and lower levels of detection."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Grammar Proposition", "text": "In this context, it is also worth mentioning that most people are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want."}, {"heading": "4 SIMULATION, RESULTS AND", "text": "DISCUSSIONWe propose to use HBRAL grammar on the basis of the hierarchical hidden Markov model (Section 3.1) to detect the activities of older people. In this model, each level is simulated as a simple hidden Markov model that follows the normal law as a law of probability with a standard deviation to evaluate the probability ratio of this model."}, {"heading": "4.1 Implementation", "text": "We look at a piece of three rooms in which each room is equipped with several sensors (presence, movement, etc.).The information provided by each sensor makes it possible to know about the activities and the presence of the person. In our case, we simulate these scenarios for 5 hours: from 7: 00 to 12: 00 a.m.. Each room contains a specific scenario that includes from one to n activities. Example: at 7: 00 a.m. the person wakes up in the bedroom, takes toilets in the bathroom. In the kitchen, our resident prepares his lunch at 8: 00 a.m.. Afterwards, he washes the dishes to watch TV."}, {"heading": "B 0.1 0.7 0.2", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.2 Evaluations", "text": "We implemented the hidden Markov model using the Matlab. We tested the performance of this model from the point of view of detecting behavior and human activity. Figure 2 shows the hidden states for each room (the first three curves) and the observation of our model (the fourth curve). Each targeted state has a specific scenario. However, the scenario kitchen is the activity that is realized in the kitchen after exact times (the third curves). The fourth curve shows the observation of these hidden states. By means of the observation sequence O, the activities of the person can be estimated after exact times (the second curves), the scenario bathroom are the activities that are realized in the kitchen after exact times (the third curves). The fourth curve (observation) shows the observation sequence O, the activities of the person can be represented by means of the transition matrix A and the initial matrix as shown in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "5 ESTIMATION", "text": "In this section, we estimate the three scenarios (scenario L, scenario K, scenario B) based on time. Figure 3 shows the assessment of the hidden state \"in this context, the state is the place / location of the person\" for each room in (300 min) based on scenarios L (living room scenario), K (kitchen) and B (bathroom). Figure 3 shows the assessment of the hidden states in relation to each room; each color represents the progression over time of each activity. Figure 3 shows that each activity takes place independently."}, {"heading": "5.1 Likelihood Measurements", "text": "To test the probability rate of the observation obtained by the Markov model, we need to compare our \"predicted\" result with the \"real\" one; from this comparison we can derive the performance and accuracy of our detection model. From these results, we can correctly assess the errors in order to know the probability rate and later derive the efficiency of our results."}, {"heading": "5.2 Measures of forecast errors in the", "text": "Prediction of ActivitiesWe can get a prediction result that is very similar to our hidden state (real state). In this section, we estimate the error rate of our observation. Error Calculation: Since the predictions are usually wrong, a good prediction should also include a measure of predictable error. Error can be calculated by the difference between the prediction and the actual event: Error = Actual Event - PredictionEt = Rt - Pt. (3) Figure 4 shows the error of the observation depending on time. Figure 4 shows that the error of the forecast does not exceed the range [-1,1]."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we were interested in event detection in intelligent environments for elderly and dependent people. Our goal was to identify and experiment with an efficient detection model. We evaluated the probability rate of the hidden Markov model based on our Home By Room Activities Language grammar in a smart home with a monitored person. Finally, we evaluated the efficiency of this model using a Matlab-based simulation tool. The results show that the proposed model is efficient for detecting activities, but the observation error rate is not very high compared to our hidden states. In the next steps of this work, we will explore the enrichment of our approach by studying learning-based systems (such as neural networks with a new learning algorithm) to detect events in a smart home and improve the learning phase by using the differential evolution algorithm (Chyengao et al., 2015)."}], "references": [{"title": "Multi-Threading System for Human Behavior Simulation based on Constraints Propagation", "author": ["O.
