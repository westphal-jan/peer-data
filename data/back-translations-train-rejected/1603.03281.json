INTRODUCTION Pre-processing of medical records is an important step that cannot be avoided in most situations and in the handling of medical records. Attributes included in medical records can be of different data types. Also, the values of attributes have a specific range that requires corresponding medical knowledge to handle them. This is because the handling of medical records is quite challenging for data miners and researchers. The various pre-processing techniques for medical records include identifying outliers in medical data, estimating and implementing missing values, normalizing medical attributes, using smoothing techniques to specify values of medical records to specify some of them.Data quality depends on data pre-processing techniques."}, {"heading": "A.

Problem Specification", "text": "Given a data set of medical records with and without missing values, the research goal is to address any missing values in medical records by using a novel efficient imputation approach based on the clustering of normal medical records to estimate missing values in medical records with missing values. The importance of the current approach we would like to propose has the following advantages. \u2022 The method can be used to find missing attribute values from medical records. \u2022 The same approach to detecting missing values can be used to classify medical records. \u2022 The disease prediction can be achieved with the proposed approach without having to adopt a separate procedure."}, {"heading": "A. Handling Medical Datasets", "text": "Research should begin by studying the benchmark data sets.

Handling Missing Values in Medical Datasets", "text": "The medical records are not free of missing values. Obviously, there is no free lunch.

Finding Nearest Medical Record and Identifying the Class Label", "text": "Since the classification includes training and testing phases, the training data set must include all possible combinations that form a knowledge base in which the class label is accurately valued. Searching for the closest data sets can be done by using KNN classifiers or other classifiers. Classification can have a curse of dimensionality, so dimensionality reduction needs to be addressed appropriately. However, this can make the situation complex and sometimes inaccurate if important attribute information or attributes are overlooked or discarded [9-11]."}, {"heading": "E. Deciding on Medical Attributes", "text": "The attributes of the medical dataset are also the main concern in predicting and classifying. This is because the attributes are multivariants [11]. One of the important tasks is also to identify the critical attributes for predicting heart disease that can have a significant impact on the classification accuracy and prediction of disease symptoms. In short, it is necessary to conduct a thorough literature survey to determine the attributes that must be taken into account and that can be discarded."}, {"heading": "F. Removal of Noise", "text": "Once we have determined the number of attributes, we can have one or more attributes that may not be important and can therefore be discarded without loss. Every effort must be made in this direction so that the attributes that are of the least importance and the removal of the attributes do not have a significant impact can be eliminated. 24 https: / / sites.google.com / site / ijcsis / ISSN 1947-5500IV. IMPUTATION FRAME WORK In this section we discuss the framework for the inclusion of incorrect values, as shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3The framework for missing values imputation consists of the following steps. The approach to missing values is based on the concept of clustering medical records without missing values. This is because all similar medical records are grouped in a cluster and therefore the imputation carried out should be more accurate. This approach to detecting missing values was not previously used in the literature."}, {"heading": "A.
