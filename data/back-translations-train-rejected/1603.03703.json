We then calculate a probable distribution of the Betti numbers configurations on the grid. This allows us to find the symmetrical distribution for the sampled grid according to the finite sequence of commutation, cyclic permutation and stabilization operations.

We perform two scenarios of sampling the beti number. In the first case, the positions of the beti number within the grid are sampled using a mixture of two Gaussian distributions N (\u00b51, \u04451) and N (\u00b52, \u04412). In the second case, a 2-dimensional gamma distribution is selected to generate the position of the beti number. The grid block of the sampled beti number is divided into substance grid squares with the size 5 x 5. We perform grid movements, including commutation, cyclic permutation, stabilization on these local grid squares. After the transformations, we obtain the hammer spacing between the original grid squares and the corresponding transformed grid squares. With these synthetic data, we perform four types of tests, including (a) commutation, (b) cyclic permutation, (grid squares) of 9 and each chain of transformations."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "We have proposed a new method to find symmetry, which is called lattice symmetry in data, by developing a new framework for the 2D lattice space. We have proposed three basic operations: commutation, cyclic permutation, and stabilization to determine symmetry. Statistical topology methods, i.e. the distribution of the beti number, are used as a feature in verifying symmetry in data. Our method of spatial distribution of beti numbers on 2D lattices can be encoded in constitutional neural network layers as a property of translational equivariance [Dieleman et al., 2016; Dieleman et al., 2015]. The method of data augmentation, as described in [Dieleman et al., 2016] for the formation of CNN's adaptations, is particularly consistent with our approach, as the random perturbations describe topological deformations well."}], "references": [{"title": "Understanding symmetries in deep networks", "author": ["Vijay Badrinarayanan", "Bamdev Mishra", "Roberto Cipolla"], "venue": "CoRR, abs/1511.01029,", "citeRegEx": "Badrinarayanan et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Badrinarayanan et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Topological pattern recognition for point cloud data", "author": ["Gunnar Carlsson"], "venue": "Acta Numerica, 23:289\u2013368,", "citeRegEx": "Carlsson.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Carlsson.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Quantum ising phases and transitions in transverse ising models.

Limited amount of available high-dimensional data and its sensitivity to noise pose computational challenges to find symmetry. Our paper presents a new method to find local symmetries in a low-dimensional 2-D grid structure which is embedded in high-dimensional structure. To compute the symmetry in a grid structure, we introduce three legal grid moves (i) Commutation (ii) Cyclic Permutation (iii) Stabilization on sets of local grid squares, grid blocks. The three grid moves are legal transformations as they preserve the statistical distribution of hamming distances in each grid block. We propose and coin the term of grid symmetry of data on the 2-D data grid as the invariance of statistical distributions of hamming distance are preserved after a sequence of grid moves. We have computed and analyzed the grid symmetry of data on multivariate Gaussian distributions and Gamma distributions with noise.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
