Neutrosophical representation is described by three parameters: the degree of truth, the degree of indeterminacy, and the degree of falsehood. In this essay, we assume that the parameters. The representation space (is a primary space for neutrrosophical information. Starting from primary space, it can be derived from other more nuanced representations belonging to polyvalent blurred spaces, where the parameter sets define blurred divisions of the unit. In these polyvalent blurred spaces, most of the four parameters of the representation are represented by Dirty Values, while all the others are blurred [7] [9]."}, {"heading": "2 Tetra and Penta Valued Representation of Bipolar Information", "text": "Bipolar uncertainty can have three characteristics that are well defined: ambiguity, ignorance and contradiction. All these three characteristics have implicit values that can be calculated with the help of the bipolar pair. At the same time, ambiguity, ignorance and contradiction can be regarded as characteristics that belong to indeterminacy but to an implicit indeterminacy. We can calculate the values of these implicit characteristics of indeterminacy. First, we calculate the index of ignorance and the index of contradiction: (2,1) (2,2) There is the following equality: which transforms into the next four-pole division of the unit: (2,4) The four terms (2,4) are related to the four logical values of Belnap logic: true, false, unknown and contradictory [5].
