Introduction", "text": "\"It is a very complex system of protein signaling pathways that interact in a complex network, which can lead to complex responses to anti-cancer drugs.\" This complexity, combined with the rapid pace of publication in the biomedical field, effectively makes these systems insoluble for human experts, and so studies are typically focused on a single path chosen at a particular time. \"It is highly likely that we will achieve this ambitious goal,\" he said. \"There is only a holistic view of these cancers through automated, large-scale lecture and wayfinding assembly to complement and extend existing human reaction networks.\" Two key prerequisites for achieving this ambitious goal are effective automatic reading and gathering methods to link these isolated interactions and combine these isolated interactions with each other to transform them into an existing cancer model."}, {"heading": "2. System architecture", "text": "The seven-based architecture described here was developed in conjunction with the Open Domain Informer (Odin) system (Valenzuela-Esca \u0301 rcega et al., 2015) for event extraction, which uses a relatively small number of human-written (and human-interpretable) rules to extract events from text. Odin, including this co-reference component, is highly scalable and, due to its grammatical regularity, can easily process thousands of papers at a rate of less than five seconds per paper, reliably measuring the full effect of correlation resolution. Even without the co-ference component, Odin is able to detect some of the relationships associated with correlation, in particular by relative pronouns as illustrated in 3. (3)."}, {"heading": "2.1. Assumptions", "text": "Although a complete reference may be preceded by an abbreviated reference, as in Example 5, most anaphers in biomedical texts (and in open domain texts) point backwards. We simplify and restrict the assumption that complete mentions will appear before anaphers. (5) After release from I\u03baB\u03b1, NF-\u03baB p65 can be subjected to post-translational modification to activate gene transcription. Event cardinality. Based on our reaction sontology and the corresponding requirements for participants, we break down n-ary event mentions into several binary events. In Example 6, we find two binding reactions, one between PIK3CA and Ras respectively and between BRAF and Ras. (6).. PIK3CA and BRAF are partially regulated by direct binding to activated forms of the Ras proteins."}, {"heading": "2.2. Sieve architecture", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "3. Experiments", "text": "While in the biomedical field, the BioNLP GE 2013 corpus (Kim et al., 2013), there is a corpus with gold comments for co-referencing, we use the Big Mechanism corpus instead for two main reasons. First, the BioNLP corpus is not compatible with the model architectures central to the Big Mechanism, such as the Biological Pathways Exchange Language (BioPAX) (Demir et al., 2010) and the Biological Expression Language (BEL) 3. For example, the BioNLP corpus does not make a functional distinction between regulatory and activation events, 3http: / / www.openbel.org / as opposed to BioPAX ontology, which specifies regulation (as \"control mechanisms\")."}, {"heading": "3.1. Evaluation", "text": "Given that there is no comment on this 1000-paper corpus, a recall is not possible as there is no gold set of events that need to be extracted. Following the evaluation of the DARPA Big Mechanism, we measure throughput, defined as the number of events (or interactions) that are extracted, as an approximate value for the call.4 Likewise, the accuracy of a single event extraction must be manually encoded using a random sample of the program output. For the overall system, this was done by independent evaluators selected by DARPA, using a precision described as generous. Since too few of the events evaluated in this way resulted from the resolution of the correlation to be able to adequately evaluate the correlation system itself, we performed a similar evaluation of 100 randomly selected events based on the same resolution."}, {"heading": "3.2. Results", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "3.3. Mutation evaluation", "text": "Mutation resolution was a late addition to the coreference system and was therefore evaluated separately for its accuracy. Three rating agencies examined a total of 77 entity and event extractions that contained at least one mutant that required coreference resolution. Of the incorrect resolutions, 79% were due to errors by the designated predecessor, similar to the \"generous precision\" above as it recognizes less than maximum informative resolutions. Accuracy under this definition was 75.7%. Of the incorrect resolutions, 79% were due to errors by the designated predecessor in sentences such as 20 where the mutation description was complicated or non-standard notation was used."}, {"heading": "4. Discussion", "text": "Although this system is productive, it does not yet make optimal use of the information in the text. Future work and ongoing improvements will be discussed next."}, {"heading": "4.1. Alias resolution", "text": "The terminology is quite contradictory between the works, as the authors often introduce aliases for proteins or mutations such as the \"E3 ligase BRAP (also referred to as IMP),\" which are retained for the duration of the work, but do not usually appear in knowledge databases such as Uniprot (UniProt Consortium, 2015), making resolution more difficult. In this case, the one-time equivalence of two names is instructive for building models of interaction in which the exact entity must be known. In future work, we will implement patterns for recognizing these aliases when they are introduced, such as \"also referred to.\" In addition, some works contain a specific section or note naming these aliases or abbreviations, as shown in Figure 2. Our co-resolution system is currently being expanded to recognize text that identifies two names that are thus equivalent."}, {"heading": "4.2. Informative ellipsis", "text": "Due to the mechanistic nature of the events in this domain, the authors can omit a lot of information. For example, the ellipse, once reconstructed, can easily double the number of detectable reactions in a clause. (22) The dephosphorylated axine binds \u03b2-catenin less efficiently than the phosphorylated form [of axine binds \u03b2-catenin].5 (23) a. JNK-I showed a stronger inhibitory effect on IL-6 expression than PKC-I. In Example 22, a correct understanding of the dissolved material allows us to detect the binding of phosphorylated axine to beta-catenin and the negative regulation of PKC-I. In Example 22, it is acceptable to detect the binding of phosphorylated axine to beta-catenin."}, {"heading": "4.3. Reference to latent entities", "text": "The results of biochemical reactions are redundant with the type of reaction and the participants, hence they are often omitted. For example, a (protein) binding reaction leads to a (protein) complex composed of the participants of the bond, which can then be referred to without being explicitly named. Essentially, this is an anaph without explicit precursor - a latent entity. (24) The TGF\u03b2 signaling is triggered by the binding of TGF\u03b2 to TBRII. The [resulting] complex [TGF\u03b2: TBRII] then recruits TBRI.5material between square brackets is added to complete the ellipse, and is not in the original text. In Example 24, the complex refers to TGF\u03b2: TBRII, the result of the binding described in the previous sentence. It is this complex that recruits TBRI (i.e., attaches itself to the BRI) that is currently being worked on to form the TF\u03b2 complement."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "This paper provides one of the first empirical measurements of the influence of entity and event correferences on large-scale event extraction in the biomedical field. While earlier work by Miwa et al. (2012) discussed the notions of co-references in the biomedical field, here we offer a concrete algorithm that effectively utilizes specific domain constraints. This work was motivated by the observation that opendomain correlation solution systems in the biomedical field work poorly because open domain algorithms in this field are insufficiently restrictive. To address this problem, we modified the seven-based approach of Lee et al. (2013) to infect domain knowledge by removing: (i) open domain screens that are not easily transferable into the biomedical domain; (ii) adding new domain-specific screens; and (iii) using the remaining open domain constraints to enhance the results of pre-domain resolution while we provide the control system with specific constraints."}, {"heading": "6.
