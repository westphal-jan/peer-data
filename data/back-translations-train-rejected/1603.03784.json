The strategy uses a game-like quiz with data and questions acquired semi-automatically from Twitter. The questions are designed to inspire participant engagement and collect relevant data to train a public-health model applied to individuals. Prior systems designed to use social media such as Twitter to predict obesity (a risk factor for T2DM) operate on entire communities such as states, counties, or cities, based on statistics gathered by government agencies. Because there is considerable variation among individuals within these groups, training data on the individual level would be more effective, but this data is difficult to acquire. The approach proposed here aims to address this issue. Our strategy has two steps. First, we trained a random forest classifier on data gathered from (public) Twitter statuses and state-level statistics with state-of-the-art accuracy. We then converted this classifier into a 20-questions-style quiz and made it available online. In doing so, we achieved high engagement with individuals that took the quiz, while also building a training set of voluntarily supplied individual-level data for future classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 21:09:19 GMT  (409kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03784v1", "This paper will appear in LREC 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper will appear in LREC 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["dane bell", "daniel fried", "luwen huangfu", "mihai surdeanu", "stephen kobourov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03784"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.03784.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Towards Using Social Media to Identify Individuals at Risk for Preventable Chronic Illness", "authors": ["Dane Bell", "Daniel Fried", "Luwen Huangfu", "Mihai Surdeanu", "Stephen Kobourov"], "emails": ["kobourov}@email.arizona.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: machine learning, obesity detection, social media"}, {"heading": "1.

Prior work", "text": "Previous work has used social media to detect events, including disaster monitoring (Sakaki et al., 2010), clustering reportable tweets in real time (McCreadie et al., 2013; Petrovic \u0301 et al., 2010), and predicting popularity of individuals (Bandari et al., 2012). Social media has also been used to research people's opinions regarding objects, individuals, organizations, and activities. For example, Tumasjan et al. (2010) and O'Connor et al. (2010) have applied accurate mood analyses to tweets and predicted election outcomes. Hu and Liu (2004) analyzed restaurant ratings based on online reviews that contain both subjective and objective judgments. Golder and Macy (2011) and Dodds et al. (2011) are interested in the temporal changes in mood in social media. Mysl\u0131 n et al. (2013) focus on understanding the perception of emerging tobacco products by analyzing tweets."}, {"heading": "3. Method", "text": "Fried et al. (2014) showed that states and large cities generate a significant number of food-related tweets that can be used to derive important information about their communities, such as obesity status or diabetes risk. In an initial experiment, we tested this classifier to identify obese people. This classifier did no better than chance, probably because of the fact that individuals have a much lower social media presence than entire communities (most Twitterers post hundreds of tweets, not millions, and rarely directly about food), which convinced us that a realistic public health tool that identifies at-risk individuals must be trained directly on individual data to learn how to use the specific signal available."}, {"heading": "3.1. An interpretable model for community classification", "text": "The first step is to develop an interpretative predictive model that identifies communities that are more likely than others to be overweight, in a way that can be transformed into questions of natural language. To this end, we started with the same attitudes as Fried et al. (2014): we collected the 887,310 tweets that are limited to a particular state and included at least one relevant hashtag, such as breakfast or dinner. Each state was assigned to a binary label as the median, comparing the percentage of overweight adults against the median state."}, {"heading": "3.2. Quiz", "text": "However, the main assumption behind this process is that language usage has parallels with actual behavior, such as that a person who talks about fruit on social media will also eat fruit in real life. This allowed us to ask more intuitive questions, such as: How often do you eat \"fruit\" in your tweets? Table 1 shows the questions and corresponding answers we used for the three left-leaning decision nodes in Figure 2. Conversion into natural language questions was as consistent as possible. Whenever the word relevant function was a food name x, the question was formulated as: \"How often do you eat x?\" with an accompanying image of the food."}, {"heading": "4. Empirical results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1. Evaluation of random forest classifier", "text": "Table 2 lists the results of our RF classifier for the classification of obese / non-obese states. We used the same experimental settings as (Fried et al., 2014), i.e. leave-one-out-cross validation for the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The table shows that our best model performed 2% better than the best model (Fried et al., 2014). Our second classifier, which used discredited numerical characteristics and was the source of the quiz, performed 2% worse, but still had acceptable accuracy and approached 80%. As previously discussed, this discrediting step was necessary to create comprehensible questions on the Likert scale (Likert, 1932)."}, {"heading": "4.2. Quiz response", "text": "Many of the participants also left feedback, some on the Reddit page associated with the quiz, as shown in Figure 4, some on the quiz page itself, as shown in Table 3. The feedback consisted largely of comments on the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of the quiz, comments expressing interest in specific questions, and speculation about how the quiz was constructed. It appears that the accuracy of the quiz was not a prerequisite for commenting on the quiz. On the contrary, participants were more likely to comment when their results were inaccurate. It is not known whether the up and down voting was motivated by the accuracy of the quiz, but researchers who built interactive prediction pages might discover that the inaccuracy is indeed more engaged (in some respects). The perceived stigma of obesity was also evident in the responses to the quiz, with some negative responses to predicting excessive weight without taking better feedback into account."}, {"heading": "4.3. Quiz evaluation", "text": "We evaluated the quiz on 945 volunteers recruited at the University of Arizona and on social media, namely Facebook, Twitter and Reddit's SampleSize subreddit7. Results are summarized in Table 4. We evaluated the accuracy of the random forest classifier by comparing the actual BMI of each person based on self-reported height and weight with the classifier's prediction. The marginal BMI for training and testing was 28.7 - the average U.S. adult BMI according to the National Center for Health Statistics (2013), which is higher than the NIH definition of obesity (BMI \u2265 25) because the average U.S. resident is overweight by this standard. These results are promising: the quiz showed an accuracy of 78.7% for dividing people into two classes: higher or lower BMI than the average U.S. resident."}, {"heading": "5. Discussion", "text": "It is important to note that the limitations of the sample are considerable: As illustrated in Table 4 and Figure 3, our initial sample is larger, lighter, and younger than the average adult in the U.S., resulting in a biased sample. Moreover, the strong bias of the sample means that the trivial prediction that no participants would exceed the BMI of 28.7 would have an accuracy of 82.3%. Furthermore, while the overall accuracy of the sample was 78.7%, the accuracy of participants reporting a BMI above 28.7 was only 16.0%. Our guess is that participants who are overweight are generally more reluctant to mention food and health-related topics on social media, resulting in poor-quality training data for that group, and the distribution of BMI for participants who were classified as below 28.7 did not differ significantly from those who were classified as above 28.7."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions and future work", "text": "We have outlined a strategy for acquiring the training data needed to build a social media-based early detection system for individuals at risk for T2DM, using a game-like quiz with data and questions obtained via Twitter. Our approach has been inspiring and provides relevant data to train a public health model applied to individuals. First, we have built a random forest classifier that improves the state-of-the-art for classifying overweight communities (especially US states). The most immediate goal is to obtain a large sample that is more representative of adults in the US, and the early results are promising: 78.7% accuracy, but the sample does not represent the general population well, and the quiz performs poorly in classifying obese people. The most immediate goal is to obtain a large sample of respondents that is more representative of adults in the US, and to expand the information that will be collected in the long run."}, {"heading": "7.

The strategy uses a game-like quiz with data and questions acquired semi-automatically from Twitter. The questions are designed to inspire participant engagement and collect relevant data to train a public-health model applied to individuals. Prior systems designed to use social media such as Twitter to predict obesity (a risk factor for T2DM) operate on entire communities such as states, counties, or cities, based on statistics gathered by government agencies. Because there is considerable variation among individuals within these groups, training data on the individual level would be more effective, but this data is difficult to acquire. The approach proposed here aims to address this issue. Our strategy has two steps. First, we trained a random forest classifier on data gathered from (public) Twitter statuses and state-level statistics with state-of-the-art accuracy. We then converted this classifier into a 20-questions-style quiz and made it available online. In doing so, we achieved high engagement with individuals that took the quiz, while also building a training set of voluntarily supplied individual-level data for future classification.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
