This is because the most efficient solver often depends on the type of instance. In other words, different approaches work well on different instance families [40]. Having an oracle that is able to predict the most suitable MaxSAT solver for a given instance would lead to the most robust solver. SATzilla's success [59] for SAT is based on a regression function that was trained to predict the performance of each solver in the given group of solvers based on the properties of an instance. If this approach is extended to a new instance, the solver with the best predicted runtime is executed on the given instance. The resulting SAT portfolios stood out at the SAT competitions in 2007 and 2009 and pushed the state of the art in SAT solving."}, {"heading": "7 Translating Pseudo-Boolean Constraints into CNF", "text": "This section covers the translation of pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints into CNF.

PB constraints are widely used to express NP-hard problems. Although there are dedicated solvers (such as Sat4j) to solve PB constraints, there are good reasons to be interested in converting the constraints into SAT (CNF formulas), and a number of methods for doing so have been reported [53, 12, 36, 2, 55, 33, 1, 13].

A PB constraint is an inequality (equality) on a linear combination of Boolean literals lin \u2211 i = 1 aili {<, \u2265, =, \u2264, >} Kwhere a1,... one and K (referred to as constraint) are constant integers and l1,... ln are literal.

However, this does not apply to terminal variables and variables that have already been taken into account by the procedure. If a terminal variable is met, it is said to be an intersection in the procedure, and if a variable is already met in the set of variables, it should be merged in the procedure. By the intersections and merges, the size of the encodings can be polynomic in some cases. In this case, there are two limitations to the PB constraint that it must have a polynomial size encoding: 1. The integers of ai's are limited in n, P (n) by a polynomial. In this case, the potential number of di, b variables for some i variables is 2n \u2212 i, but due to the merges, this number is reduced to a polynomial."}, {"heading": "7.3.2 Exponential cases", "text": "There are possible sequences of ai's that result in a tree with branches of length \u0432 (n) and without possible merging of nodes (which implies a tree of size \u0432 (2n). The idea here is simply to combine a constant sequence with a geometric sequence. Let n be the length of the PB constraint Q and let ai = \u03b1 + bi so that \u03b1 = bn + 2. The key point is that the geometric term must be negligible compared to the constant term, that is, i = 0 bi < \u03b1. For simplicity we choose b = 2. Note that in this case ai = 2n + 2 + 2i, which is not limited by a polynomial in n.

The goal is to preserve the inner state of the constraint solver as well as learned clauses discovered during the solving process of previous iterations.

Experimental evaluations of MaxSAT solvers gained great interest among SAT and MaxSAT researchers. This is due to the fact that solvers are becoming increasingly efficient and more adequate to handle WPMaxSAT instances from real-world applications. Therefore, conducting such an investigation and comparing the efficiency of different solvers is critical to knowing which solution techniques are suitable for which input category. In fact, an annual event called MaxSAT Evaluations is planned for exactly this purpose. The first MaxSAT evaluation was held in 2006.

"The Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem is the problem of finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses of a given Boolean formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Many exact solvers for MaxSAT have been developed during recent years, and many of them were presented in the well-known SAT conference. Algorithms for MaxSAT generally fall into two categories: (1) branch and bound algorithms and (2) algorithms that use successive calls to a SAT solver (SATbased), which this paper in on. In practical problems, SAT-based algorithms have been shown to be more efficient. This paper provides an experimental investigation to compare the performance of recent SAT-based and branch and bound algorithms on the benchmarks of the MaxSAT Evaluations. 1 ar X iv :1 60 3. 03 81 4v 1 [ cs .A I] 1 1 M ar 2 01 6", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
