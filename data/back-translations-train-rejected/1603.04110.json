Based on extracted GOIs the area of a long-term GPS trajectory is partitioned into a grid area with inhomogeneous shaped cells. This proposes a method consists of three phases: (i) extracting the geometry of stay regions based on the concepts of time-value and the time-weighted centroid, (ii) determining the geometry of destination regions based on the extracted stay regions using a geometry based hierarchical clustering, and (iii) partitioning the trajectory area based on the geometry of the destination regions and their visit frequency. The extracted GOIs can effectively represent the geometries of the POIs of the mobile object while guaranteeing the characteristics of a valid partitioning. The proposed method is tested using a field database covering the trajectory of a mobile object with the length of 3.5 years, and the achieved results are compared to the state-of-the-art. Our experimental results show that the proposed stay extraction can detect valid stay regions with only one track point while the other methods lose those stays. Moreover, analysis of the outcomes of the method using empirical observation shows that the quality of the extracted stay regions, destination regions and the GOIs extracted by our proposed method is considerably higher than those extracted by methods proposed in the state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Mar 2016 01:52:28 GMT  (8038kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04110v1", "A version of this technical report has been submitted to the Springer Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing and it is under review"], ["v2", "Mon, 16 May 2016 20:24:07 GMT  (19454kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04110v2", "A version of this technical report has been submitted to the Springer Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing and it is under review"]], "COMMENTS": "A version of this technical report has been submitted to the Springer Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing and it is under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["seyed morteza mousavi", "aaron harwood", "shanika karunasekera", "mojtaba maghrebi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.04110"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.04110.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Geometry of Interest (GOI): Spatio-Temporal Destination Extraction and Partitioning in GPS Trajectory Data", "authors": ["Seyed Morteza Mousavi", "Aaron Harwood", "Shanika Karunasekera", "Mojtaba Maghrebi"], "emails": ["mousavi@student.unimelb.edu.au", "aharwood@unimelb.edu.au", "karus@unimelb.edu.au", "maghrebi@unsw.edu.au"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "These applications often need to filter out the time-stamped sequence of visited locations (SVLs) of the mobile objects.

Among all these types of trajectories, our work focuses on trajectories collected by GPS sensors. GPS trajectories have been used in various research projects in various applications (Zheng and Zhou, 2011), but our work is a pre-processing prerequisite for all applications that seek to extract the GOIs of mobile objects.2.1 In related work aimed at understanding the trajectories of the object's trajectories, we have discussed their trajectories and their boundaries and their possibilities."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 Grid with homogeneous cells", "text": "The first approach is to divide the trajectory into a homogeneous grid to represent the interesting regions (e.g. (Xue et al, 2013)).The shape of the cells is often considered triangular, square, rectangular or hexagonal, but the main disadvantage of this approach is the degree of granularity of the cell. Coarse granularity means that each of the grid cells covers a wide range that can encompass different POIs, and the fine granularity means that a POI is located in different cells, which has a significant disadvantage for the quality of SVLs extracted from such grids."}, {"heading": "2.1.2 Coverage Area Based", "text": "The second approach defines the POIs as the area covered by a wireless access point (Song et al, 2006) in wireless networks or the area covered by base stations (BTS) of a mobile network (Siet al, 2010).The geometries of the POIs are constructed with circular surfaces or hexagonal polygons around the access points or the BTS. The main problem with this approach is that estimating a fixed geometry for the area covered by a wireless access point or BTS is not easy for various reasons, such as signal power, noise and obstacles, especially in urban areas. Also, the above-mentioned problems related to the granularity of the network cells remain. For example, the covered area of a BTS in a mobile network could cover a very wide area comprising different POIs, or the covered area of an access point could not cover the entire area of a POI (covered by more than one access point)."}, {"heading": "2.1.3 Spatial Clustering Based", "text": "The third approach is to construct the geometries of the POIs on the basis of the GPS track points in the trajectory datasets using simple spatial clustering methods without taking into account the temporal aspects of the GPS trajectories. Spatial clustering methods are very similar to classic clustering systems such as KMeans (Ashbrook and Starner, 2003), Gaussian mixing model (GMM) (Banfield and Raftery, 1993), and DBSCAN (Zhou et al, 2004).These methods simply bundle the GPS points with measures such as the distance between GPS points or density connectivity in a two-dimensional Cartesian space, without considering the third dimensional data time, and the division of the tractor area based on these cluster geometries.

This approach is not applicable in GPS datasets where the GPS speed is not available or the speed cannot be calculated easily (e.g. on routes with low sampling rates or large time gaps). In addition, there are some scenarios where defining a limit speed limit is not easy. Suppose a mobile object carries a GPS-enabled mobile phone. During daily travel activities, it might have different transport modes (e.g. on foot, bicycle, train, car, bus, etc.) (Zheng et al, 2010). In each of the transport modes, the speed threshold should be different, as the average walking speed is different from driving a car. Moreover, even if we adopt the same transport mode for the mobile object, car, bus, etc. (Zheng et al, 2010), the speed in the shopping malls is different from driving in the other places while moving at the same speed (many)."}, {"heading": "2.1.5 Spatio-Temporal Clustering Based", "text": "The fifth approach (Ye et al, 2009; Xiao et al, 2010) uses time-limited spatial and temporal clustering to extract the sojourn regions and destinations, extracting the sojourn regions based on predefined spatial and temporal constraints, then merging the sojourn regions to construct the destinations. They define a valid sojourn region (an ambient distance with a radius \u2206 D \u2264 Dmax) within which the mobile object has moved away (stopped or kept moving) over a period of time. This approach is widely used in research such as (Ye et al, 2009; Xiao et al, 2010; Zheng et al, 2009; Xiao et al, 2014) to group the sojourn regions using density-based cluster methods (OPTICS et al, 2009).

In the process of recording GPS observations, which are often performed by GPS devices on vehicles or mobile phones, ideally we will collect each GPS observation at a constant sampling rate. Thus, people tend to turn off their GPS sensors, which has a dramatic impact on the quality of the GPS trajectories collected. Another reason is poor GPS coverage in places such as inner cities and especially indoors, the process of GPS data collection is often terminated by the user for long periods of time."}, {"heading": "5 Methodology", "text": "Our definition method has three phases: (i) spatiotemporal extraction of the destination regions, (ii) construction of the destination regions based on the extracted destination regions, (iii) division of the destination regions based on the extracted destination regions. In the following, we discuss each phase of the method and compare it with the related work in detail.5.1 Spatio-Temporal extraction of the destination regions into a sequence of stays and movements. We define a stay si as an event that occurred within the period of a mobile object. The event occurred in a geometric region or neighborhood called a destination region. A destination region is an area in which the mobile object spends some time."}, {"heading": "6 Computational Complexity", "text": "In the rod extraction phase, in the worst case, the temporal complexity of our method O (n2) for n track points in the trajectory. However, in practice, since the sum of the track points of the extracted stays is substantially less than n. Note that the inner loop in Alg. 1 deals with the calculation of the centroids of the stay regions, which depends on the number of track points in each stay. Since a large number of track points in the trajectory are not bundled in the stages (due to limitations of a valid stay), the sum of the track points of the stay regions is much lower than n. The calculation of the diameter of the stays in the work of (Hariharan and Toyama, 2004) is more complex than the calculation of the centroid in our method, because for the calculation of the diameter, we must calculate the distance of the individual points to all other points in the trajectory."}, {"heading": "7 Experimental Results", "text": "In this section, we analyze the performance of our proposed methodology compared to base regions."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we addressed the problem of determining the geometries of interest of a mobile object and dividing the trajectory area into a grid by analyzing its GPS trajectories. Research shows that taking into account the concept of time-value of GPS points significantly improves the accuracy of trajectory region extraction. Furthermore, the results of this study support the idea that taking into account the trajectory geometries makes the estimated GOIs much more similar to the real world. This research has raised many questions that require further investigation and will serve as a basis for future studies. It would be interesting to focus on improving the performance and accuracy of our proposed distribution method by aggregating the trajectory data of other mobile objects moving in the same area of our particular mobile object. Further improvements, such as the use of failed detection methods to detect and remove the failed points from the point of flight targets, could further improve the results."}], "references": [{"title": "Another efficient algorithm for convex hulls in two dimensions", "author": ["A Andrew"], "venue": "Information Processing Letters", "citeRegEx": "Andrew,? \\Q1979\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Andrew", "year": 1979}, {"title": "Optics: ordering points to identify the clustering structure", "author": ["M Ankerst", "MM Breunig", "HP Kriegel", "J Sander"], "venue": "Sigmod Record, ACM,", "citeRegEx": "Ankerst et al\\.,? \\Q1999\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ankerst et al\\.", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Using gps to learn significant locations and predict movement across multiple users", "author": ["D Ashbrook", "T Starner"], "venue": "Personal and Ubiquitous Computing", "citeRegEx": "Ashbrook and Starner,? \\Q2003\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ashbrook and Starner", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Voronoi diagrams&mdash;a survey of a fundamental geometric data structure", "author": ["F Aurenhammer"], "venue": "ACM Comput Surv", "citeRegEx": "Aurenhammer,? \\Q1991\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Aurenhammer", "year": 1991}, {"title": "Model-based gaussian and non-gaussian clustering.

collected by GPS-enabled devices such as vehicles navigation systems and mobile phones. GPS trajectory data is useful for applications such as traffic management, location forecasting, and itinerary planning. Such applications often need to extract the time-stamped Sequence of Visited Locations (SVLs) of the mobile objects. The nearest neighbor query (NNQ) is the most applied method for labeling the visited locations based on the IDs of the POIs in the process of SVL generation. NNQ in some scenarios is not accurate enough. To improve the quality of the extracted SVLs, instead of using NNQ, we label the visited locations as the IDs of the POIs which geometrically intersect with the GPS observations. Intersection operator requires the accurate geometry of the points of interest which we refer to them as the Geometries NICTA VRL, Department of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Australia Tel.: +61-405967448 E-mail: mousavi@student.unimelb.edu.au Department of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Australia Tel.: +61-383441351 E-mail: aharwood@unimelb.edu.au Department of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Australia Tel.: +61-383441351 E-mail: karus@unimelb.edu.au School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, UNSW, Australia Tel.: +61-383441351 E-mail: maghrebi@unsw.edu.au of Interest (GOIs). In some application domains (e.g. movement trajectories of animals), adequate information about the POIs and their GOIs may not be available a priori, or they may not be publicly accessible and, therefore, they need to be derived from GPS trajectory data. In this paper we propose a novel method for estimating the POIs and their GOIs, which consists of three phases: (i) extracting the geometries of the stay regions; (ii) constructing the geometry of destination regions based on the extracted stay regions; and (iii) constructing the GOIs based on the geometries of the destination regions. Using the geometric similarity to known GOIs as the major evaluation criterion, the experiments we performed using long-term GPS trajectory data show that our method outperforms the existing approaches.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
