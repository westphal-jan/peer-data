Do we simply blindfolded or based on our previous assumptions or conjectures, or can we gain more solid ground for assessing the value of translations? Again, Tov is our expert as well as our challenge, provided that we can use the LXX as a tool in biblical criticism. 42 According to [Tov, 2015: 236] the contribution of LXX can clearly be seen in the fact of what researchers consider to be scriptural changes, pted and41 [Carr, 2011: 65] recommends analyzing a \"process characterized by extensive verbal agreement between traditions combined with occasional variations between similar or virtually identical semantic contents.\" 42See [Tov, 2012: 37n]."}, {"heading": "3.3 The Task of Text-analysis and Joshua in the End", "text": "The final task arising from the collection of resources concerns the question of whether textual criticism should be converted into editing criticism or kept completely separate from the question of editing. [http: Winther-Nielsen, 1995: 21], however, I worked with the ETCBC database for the entire book of Joshua. The evidence suggested to me that the MT text is generally uncorrupted, with only minor written errors, in contrast to the variations in the LXX, which \"mostly contains abbreviations and simplifications of the MT.\" Nevertheless, a number of scholars and most recently and recently composed Graeme Auld, have claimed that the LXX-X is superior to the nations, that there was a Greek translation behind most of the LXX-X genes, but it was \"not long preserved in a pure form.\" It split into several secondary textual traditions and then a stabilization in the LX-G2 gene."}], "references": [{"title": "The Samaritan Pentateuch: an introduction to its origin, history, and significance for biblical studies.
