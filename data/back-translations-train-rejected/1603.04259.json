Skip-gram with negative sampling", "text": "(SGNS) - Related working SGNS is a method for embedding neural words introduced by Mikolov et. al in [8]. The method aims to find a word representation that captures the relationship between a word and its surrounding words in a sentence. In the rest of this section, we provide a brief overview of the SGNS method. Faced with a word sequence 1 () K i w = from a finite vocabulary 1 {} W i i W = =, the Skip-gram goal is to maximize the following term: 1, 01 log (|) Ki j ii c j j c j c jp w K + = \u2212 \u2264 1, where c is half the context window size (which depends on i w) and (|) j i p w w w is the softmax function: exp () exp () exp () i yj i T Ti kk Ip w w wu (2), where the word W is the sensitivity size (W) and correspondence size (m)."}, {"heading": "5 610 10\u2212 .", "text": "Negative samples alleviate the above calculation problem by replacing the Softmax function of Equation (2) with 1 (|) () () N T Tj i i i kk p w u v u v\u03c3 \u03c3 = = - where () 1 / 1 exp () x x\u03c3 = + \u2212, N is a parameter that determines the number of negative examples to be drawn per positive example. To overcome the imbalance between rare and frequent words, the following subsample procedure is proposed [8]: In view of the input word sequence, we discard each word w with a probability (|) 1 () p discard w f f w = \u2212 where () f w is the frequency of the word."}, {"heading": "3. Item2Vec \u2013 SGNS for item-based CF", "text": "Note that information about the relationship between the user and a number of elements is not always available. For example, we could be supplied with a data set generated from orders received by a store without information about what identity the order has sent. In other words, there are scenarios in which several sets of elements could belong to the same user, but this information is not provided. In Section 4, we show that our method also handles these scenarios. We propose to apply SGNS to item-based CF. Applying SGNS to CF data is simple once we have observed that a sequence of words corresponds to a set or a basket of elements, so we will henceforth use the terms \"word\" and \"element\" interchangeably. Moving from sequences to sets that define spatial / temporal information as identical, we will get lost."}, {"heading": "4. Experimental Results", "text": "In this section, we provide an empirical evaluation of the proposed method. We provide both qualitative and quantitative results, depending on whether metadata about the items exists. As a basic item-based CF algorithm, we used item-item SVD."}, {"heading": "4.1 Datasets", "text": "The first data set consists of 9M events. Each event consists of a user-artist relationship, which means that the user has played a song by the particular artist. The data set contains 732K users and 49K different artists. The second data set contains physical goods orders from the Microsoft Store. An order is made through a shopping cart without information about the user who created it. Therefore, the information in this data set is weaker in the sense that we cannot establish a link between user and item. The data set consists of 379K orders (containing more than a single item) and 1706 different items."}, {"heading": "4.2 Systems and parameters", "text": "We applied Item2Vec to both datasets. Optimization is done using stochastic gradient decency. We executed the algorithm for 20 epochs. We set the negative sampling value to 15N = for both datasets. The dimension parameter m was set to 100 and 40 for the music and loading datasets, respectively. We also used subsampling with item-item similarity system. For this purpose, we applied SVD to a square matrix in the size of the items, in which the (,) i-j entry appears the number of times (,) i-w as a positive pair in the dataset. Afterwards, we normalized each entry according to the square root of the product of its row and column sums. Finally, the latent representation is given by the series (,) i-w."}, {"heading": "4.3 Experiments and results", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "Item2Vec is based on SGNS with minor modifications. We present both quantitative and qualitative assessments demonstrating the effectiveness of Item2Vec compared to an SVD-based item similarity model. We observed that Item2Vec produces a better representation of items than the SVD-based base model, where the gap between the two becomes more significant for unpopular items. We explain this by the fact that Item2Vec uses subsamples of popular items. In the future, we plan to investigate more complex CF models such as [1, 2, 3] and compare them with Item2Vec."}, {"heading": "A COMPARISON BETWEEN SVD AND ITEM2VEC", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "ON GENRE CLASSIFICATION TASK FOR VARIOUS", "text": "SIZES OF TOP POPULAR ARTIST SETSTop (q) popularartistsSVDAccuracyItem2Vec Accuracy2.5K 85% 86.4% 5K 83.4% 84.2% 10K 80.2% 82% 15K 76.8% 79.5% 20K 73.8% 10K unpopular (see text) 58.4% 68% [4] Sarwar B, Karypis G, Konstan J, Riedl J.
