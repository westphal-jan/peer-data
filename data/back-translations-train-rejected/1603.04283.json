This is an online version of the standard problem of binary classification, because we will be interested in endless sequences of observations, where X is an object space and 2: = {0, 1}. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that X is a given finite set of, say, binary strings (where the intuition is that finite objects can always be encoded as binary strings). Finite sequences of observations are referred to as negative data sequences."}, {"heading": "2 Laws of nature as prediction systems", "text": "According to Popper's [1] view of the philosophy of science, natural laws should be falsifiable: if a finite sequence of observations contradicts such a law, we should be able to recognize it. (Popper often preferred to talk about scientific theories or statements rather than natural laws.) The empirical content of a natural law is the amount of its potential falsifiers ([1], Sections 31 and 35). We begin by formalizing this term in our toy setting and interpret the requirement that we should be able to detect falsifications in such a way that we should be able to detect them. Formally, we define a natural law L as a recursively enumerable prefix-free subset (X) of that (where prefix-free means are that the prefix-free means is 2 / E condition that the x-condition is inaccurate). (Intuitively, these are the potential falsifiers, i.e., follow-ups of the law are forbidden by observations."}, {"heading": "3 Strong prediction systems", "text": "The idea of a natural law is static; experience tells us that natural laws ultimately fail and are replaced by other laws. Popper presented his picture of this process through formulas (\"evolutionary schemes\") that PS1 \u2192 TT1 \u2192 EE1 \u2192 PS2 \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 (2) (introduced in his 1965 lecture, on which [2], Chapter 6, is based and discussed in several other places in [2] and [3]; in our notation we follow Wikipedia). In response to a problem situation PS, a preliminary theory TT is subjected to attempts at error removal, the success of which leads to a new problem situation, and scientists come up with a new preliminary theory TT, etc. In our toy version of this process, preliminary theories are laws of nature, problem situations situations where our current law of nature is falsified, and there are no active attempts at error removal."}, {"heading": "4 Weak prediction systems and universal pre-", "text": "A weak prediction system L is defined as a sequence (not required to be nested in any sense). L1, L2,.. the laws of nature Ln (X \u00b7 2), which are jointly recursively enumerated. (Un > Popper's evolutionary scheme (2) was the simplest one he considered; its more complicated ones, such as asPS1a and 287), give rise to weak rather than strong prediction systems. In the rest of this paper, we will omit \"weak\" prediction systems."}, {"heading": "5 Universal conformal prediction under the IID", "text": "In this situation, a reasonable predictive set is for the case where N is the number of observations in the situation s (n), it means that we trust the predictive system whose error rate is the most high so far. Up to this point, our exposure is completely probable, but in the rest of this section, we will consider the special case in which the data is generated in the IID manner. For simplicity, we will only consider computable conformity measures that take values in the set Q of rational numbers. Let's use a conformal predictor based on a computable measurement in Q. Then there are C > 0 ones that take values in the set Q of rational numbers for almost all computable conformity measures."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Analogous to the Kolmogorov Complexity Theory, we expect the simplest and most elegant results to be achieved for computational models that are more flexible than Turing machines, such as Kolmogorov-Uspensky algorithms and beauty machines.
