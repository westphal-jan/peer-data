Our choice of problem cases has been guided by two principles: (i) The benchmark should consist of queries that are inherently difficult to solve, so we have excluded simple queries that can be answered in a few milliseconds. (ii) While artificially created problem solutions are very useful in understanding how syntactic properties affect the behavior of algorithms, the right methodology for generating such instances has not attracted much attention."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "The recalcitrance of first-order logic has opened up interesting research possibilities for understanding the causes of the problem and developing new algorithms to overcome it. In this article, we have described two techniques to make thinking more efficient: the first uses decision trees to guide the search for German rules by providing the semantic context in which a rule should lead to results; the second uses statistical regression techniques to provide an estimate of the number of answers a node should provide based on search meta characteristics; the inference engine uses this heuristics to order nodes during the search; and the experimental results of thousands of queries show an order of magnitude of acceleration. These results suggest several lines of future work. First, we need to test this heuristics against even larger queries to understand their dynamics; second, we want to expand our implementation of the decision tree to perform probability calculations."}], "references": [{"title": "Premise Selection for Mathematics by Corpus Analysis and Kernel Methods", "author": ["J.
