It is of critical interest to the pharmaceutical industry as it promises to reduce the cost of initial screening of substances by reducing the number of laboratory tests required to identify a bioactive substance. It focuses on providing a range of potentially active substances that may be significantly \"enriched\" in terms of the prevalence of bioactive substances compared to a purely random sample of the substances in question. The paper is an extension of our work presented in [17]. Although this goal may be helpful in itself with the classical machine learning techniques that normally provide a mere prediction, the Conformal Predictors (CP) well-founded predictions provide some additional information that can be used to benefit in many ways. First, CPs provide the valid benchmarks for confidence in predicting the bioactivity of substances. Second, they can provide predictive and confidence for individual substances."}, {"heading": "2 Machine learning background", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Conformal Predictors", "text": "Conformity predictors described in [13, 7] revolve around the concept of conformity (or rather non-conformity). Intuitively, one way of looking at the problem of classification is to assign a label y to a new object x, so that the example (x, y) is not out of place among the educational examples chosen (x1, y1), (x2, y2),..., (x, y). To find out how \"strange\" the new example is compared to the educational proposition, we use the Non-Conformity Measure (NCM) for measurement (x, y). The advantage of approaching classification in this way is that it leads to a novel method to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction, among some more general hypotheses. A Non-conformity measurement can be extracted from any machine learning algorithm, although there is no universal method to select it."}, {"heading": "2.2 Inductive Mondrian Conformal Predictors", "text": "To apply conform predictors to both large and unbalanced datasets, we combine two variants of conform predictors from [13, 7]: Inductive (to reduce computational complexity) and Mondrian (to manage unbalanced datasets) conform predictors. In order to combine the conform prediction with the conformal inductive prediction, we need to revise the definition of the p-value for the case of Mondrian so that it takes into account the changes caused by the division of the training set and the evaluation of \u03b1i only in the calibration set. It is customary to split the training set at the index h so that examples with index i \u2264 h represent the correct training set and examples with index i \u2264 (and i \u2264) represent the calibration theory.The p values for a hypothesis y '+ 1 = y = y = \u03b11 are defined as a value."}, {"heading": "3 Application to Compound Activity Prediction", "text": "In order to evaluate the performance of CP for Compound Activity Prediction in a realistic scenario, we sourced the data sets from a publicly available repository for High Throughput Assays, PubChem BioAssay [20]. The data sets on PubChem identify a connection with their CID (a unique compound identifier that can be used to access the chemical data of the compound in another PubChem database) and return the result of the test as active / inactive as well as the actual measurements on which the result was derived, e.g. the viability (percentage of living cells) of the sample after exposure to the compound. In order to apply machine learning techniques to this problem, the compounds must be described in terms of a number of numerical attributes. There are several approaches to do this. The one followed in this study is the calculation of the signature descriptive characteristics [6]."}, {"heading": "3.1 Underlying algorithms", "text": "It is only a matter of time before that happens, that it happens."}, {"heading": "3.2 Tools and Computational Resources", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "3.3 Results", "text": "To assess the relative advantages of the various underlying algorithms, we applied Mondrian Inductive Conformal Predictors to AID827 data set, whose characteristics are shown in Table 3.The test was articulated in 20 cycles of training and evaluation. In each cycle, a test set of 10,000 examples was randomly extracted; the remaining examples were randomly divided into a real training set of 100,000 examples and calibrated with the equilibrium of the examples (28,387).During SVM training, a 5x stratified cross validation was performed in each phase of the cascade to select an optimal value for the hyperparameter. Pro-class weights were also assigned to calculate the value of the high-class imbalances in the data, so that a higher level of punishability was applied to violators in the less represented class. In the Multinomial of Bayes, cross validation was also used to select an optimal value for the parameters."}, {"heading": "3.4 Application to different data sets", "text": "We have applied inductive compliant predictors with underlying SVM with Tanimoto + > RBF kernel to other data sets extracted from PubChem BioAssay to verify whether the same performance would be achieved for tests covering a range of very different biological objectives and to what extent performance would vary with differences in training size, imbalance and thriftiness of training. Key characteristics of the data sets are reported in Table 6.As in the previous series of experiments, 20 cycles of training and testing were conducted and the results averaged. In each cycle, a test set of 10,000 examples was set aside and the remainder was split between calibration set (\u2248 30, 000) and proper training. Results will be shown in Table 7.It can be seen that five data sets differ in their hardness for machine learning, producing some of the uncertain predictions that have the same algorithms, number of examples and the same meaning."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions", "text": "This paper summarizes a methodology for applying compliant predictions to large and unbalanced data with multiple underlying methods such as Bayes, SVM, and different cores, and compares the results in terms of the efficiency of different methods and different dataset sizes. [15] The paper also presents results from the use of Mondrian inductive conformant predictors with different levels of significance for different classes. The most interesting direction of future expansion is to study the possible strategies of active learning (or experimental designs).One of the performance criteria in this paper is a series of uncertain predictions. It may be useful to select among them the compounds that should be tested experimentally first - in other words, the \"most promising\" compounds. However, how they are selected may depend on practical scenarios of further learning and the comparative efficiency of various active learning strategies."}, {"heading": "5 Acknowledgments", "text": "This project (ExCAPE) was funded within the framework of the research and innovation programme Horizon 2020 of the European Union under the funding agreement 671555.
