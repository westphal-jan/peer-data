However, it does not seem that any of them have solved the linguistic problems that the donkey anaphora represents; there is a devastating counter-example for all. (6) Every school that employs a pretty PC teacher who teaches every learner with a Mac device buys them for themselves. It is just another donkey sentence that has the same linguistic characteristics as the Geach sentence. If it were the case that they had actually solved the donkey anaphora, then the same formal techniques could be appropriately coded (6) as they could (1). But none of them can formalize (6)."}, {"heading": "1.1.1 Dynamic Theories", "text": "Unlike more traditional formal linguistics built around Russian interpretation, DRT treats the quantifying power of a noun contextually. (ii) For any farmer X who owns a donkey Y, it is possible to derive (i) in a way consistent with \"normal\" anaphora. Accepting the generally accepted view, it is possible to (1) interpret the so-called weak reading: (5) and the so-called strong reading: (4), then modern DRT offers some interim solution by choosing according to his / her preference either (4) or (ii) - which is not quite (5), but even closer to it."}, {"heading": "1.1.2 Substitution theories", "text": "There are other approaches based on the E-type theory of Evans [5]. (7) If Thomas1 owns a donkey, he beats it 2. (8) If Thomas owns a donkey, Thomas beats the donkey. Evans argues that, for example, if we have (7), it should be paraphrasable, (8) where the anaphorical Thomas is replaced by the particular Thomas to whom the donkey belongs, and similarly for the donkey. By applying this principle to (1), we get (9). (9) Every farmer who owns a donkey beats the donkey 1. Readers are referred to the cited references to the syntax. The clarity of the assumption justifies the use of the definitive noun expression donkey in (9). Although the E-type theory appeals to intuition, this approach has not found many supporters."}, {"heading": "1.1.3 Anaphora is not bound by the context that binds its antecedent", "text": "There is a problem common to all of the above. Consider (6), the Mac sentence. In the sentence, while the pronoun is anaphorical to the Mac machine, it is by no means the Mac sentence intended to mean the school X that meets the specified condition, the Mac machine (s) that belongs to the female student (s) purchases for the handsome PC teacher. Naturally, this is a brand new Mac machine that the school buys for him. In other words, although it is indeed a Mac machine, the Mac machine cannot be further specified due to the specific context in which it appears in the Mac sentence. Therefore, the Mac sentence is also a testimony that neither the strong reading of (1), which (4), nor the weak reading, which (5) is, as categorized in [13], is generally enough generic for an autobiographical sentence [6]."}, {"heading": "1.2 A new approach with Gradual Logic", "text": "This year, we have reached the point where we see ourselves as being able to live in a country where we are able, where we are able to leave a country in order to create a new world."}, {"heading": "1.3 Predicate Gradual Logic encoding of donkey sentences", "text": "However, I believe that it is probably more helpful to first provide examples of graduated logical expressions than to spell out rigorous formal definitions directly. Semantics is not developed before Section 3, and the formal expressions themselves may not be fully understood except by some. But, it is more important to understand explanations of features of logic given after the examples at this point than the examples themselves. Now, although I present materials in this order for the best, any reader who only wants to see examples after the semantics of logic have been given is to go immediately to Section 3 and should immediately return to that part and Section 2. Minimal reading aids: x, y l x, and u l x and so on are variable. l is associated to the left. m ties stronger than any donkey and weaker than any donkey in the school. x is a binary operator. (5) Every peasant who owns a donkey suggests a donkey he / she owns."}, {"heading": "1.3.1 Scopes of quantifiers", "text": "In the logic of the first order, if we assume that x is a variable, we have for the universal quantification x and for the existential quantification x. In both cases, x does not occur freely in terms of its extent, and this is no different in predicate logic."}, {"heading": "1.3.2 Attributed objects", "text": "In all five of the above formal expressions, there is a variable of the type l x. It means that y, as an attribute of x.Significance of, is best explained by the principle of recognition [2, 15]: even if two things are distinguishable, they are not distinguished in an area where the distinction is imperceptible. v1 \"v2 says that v1 cannot be the same as v2, but that they are as indistinguishable as possible."}, {"heading": "1.3.3 Existential import", "text": "Under Fregean's interpretation, a universal expression assumes no existential meaning, while an existential expression does. An expression of the kind of (1) does not presuppose under the interpretation the existence of a pawn to whom a donkey belongs. That is, it may be a phantom term. I will argue in Section 2 that this convention does not assign unambiguous truth value to natural expressions, such as the Mac theorem. Currently, I note that there should be no such phantom terms, if the truth / falsehood of the proposition that contains them is at all assessable. Consequently, for every predicate available to any area of the discourse, there must be at least one entity in the sphere of the discourse that can be determined by it."}, {"heading": "1.3.4 Attributed predicates", "text": "This means that the farmer m & # 246; density is the farmer with the attribute of & # 252;. & # 34; The attribute is the farmer with the attribute of & # 34;. & # 34; This means that the farmer m & # 246; density is a predicate f & # 252; for the farmer who has a predicate f & # 252; for the donkey. & # 34; The predicate is the donkey who is a predicate f & # 252; r who is a predicate f & # 252; for the donkey. & # 34; The predicate is the donkey who is a predicate f & # 252; r who is a predicate f & # 252; for the donkey."}, {"heading": "1.3.5 Let us check the given examples", "text": "That is why it has come to the point where it has never come to this."}, {"heading": "2.1 Existential import", "text": "2.1.1 Being 1) Man transforms. 2) Tom transforms. Many may agree that man in 1) is a man in general, or an idealization of what a man is, as if a single unique entity were spoken, if, as Aristotle suggests, an expression of universal character, but not expressed universally, were to be distinguished from a universal expression of universal character. I reckon, however, that in the modern logical context, in which one has the freedom to define a domain of discourse at will, it would not make much difference: one could simply choose, if it pleased, such a domain of discourse in which man is a single entity. In contrast, a good number of formal logic, who have become acquainted with Fregean's logic, would contradict the statement that Tom is in 1) Tom in general.
