Related Work and Main Results", "text": "Submodular optimization was seen as a powerful tool for combinatorial, massive data mining and machine learning, for which a streaming algorithm processes the datasets piece by piece and then produces an approximate solution right at the end of the data stream. This makes it quite suitable to process a massive dataset in many applications.If d = 1 and all entries are C, problem (1) is synonymous with maximizing a monotonous submodular function applied under a cardinality constraint. This optimization problem has proven to be NP-hard [4], and people have developed many approximation algorithms to solve this problem, among which the greedy algorithms [4] are the most popular. Specifically, the greedy algorithm selects the element with the maximum limit in each step and produces a (1 \u2212 1) approximation guarantee with O (k) of computational complexity that can include the number of elements and the number of elements proposed."}, {"heading": "III.

Special Case: One Cardinality Constraint", "text": "Let us first consider a specific case of the d-MASK problem: the maximization of a submodular function is subject to a cardinality limitation: the maximization of S-V f (S) is subject to the solution. (2) In [4], the authors of this problem have demonstrated that the \"gap\" to the optimal solution is reduced by a significant amount. Formally, when element j is added to the current solution set by the greedy algorithm, the limit f (j) of this selected element should be at least above a certain threshold. In [5], the authors developed the so-called Sieve Streaming Algorithm, where the threshold for the limit is set. (OPT / 2 \u2212 f (S) / k."}, {"heading": "B. General Case: Multiple Knapsack Constraints", "text": "To get the desirable output, in this subsection, we first assume that we have some knowledge of OPT, and remove this assumption by estimating OPT based on the maximum value per weight of an individual element. In the end, we will remove all assumptions to develop the final version of the streaming algorithm for the general case of a d-MASK problem. Suppose we know a value v that contains the maximum value of OPT \u2264 2 OPT-KNOWN-D-MASK 1, that is, we know an approximation of the streaming algorithm to a constant factor. We then construct the following algorithm to select a subset S with knowledge of the optimal value of the problem."}, {"heading": "C. Online Bound", "text": "To evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms, we need to compare the functional values determined by our streaming algorithm against the OPT by calculating its relative difference. Since OPT is not known, we could use an upper limit of the OPT to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. By Theorem 4, we get OPT \u2264 1 + 2d 1 \u2212 (1 + 2d) f (S).

Problems with Ground-Set Dependent Submodular Functions", "text": "In the previous sections, we have discussed the case where the submodular function f is independent of the fundamental set V. In the following, we will discuss the setting in which f is additive degradable [8], and the value of f (S) depends not only on the subset S, but also on the fundamental set V. Here, a function f is called to be additive degradable [8] above the fundamental set V, if there is a family of functions {fi} | V | i = 1 with fi: 2V \u2192 [0, \u221e) independent of the fundamental set V such as, thatf (S) = 1 | V | \u2211 i, V fi (S). (11) Algorithm 4 is still useful when f is dependent on the fundamental set, but additive decompatible. To reduce the computational complexity, we randomly choose a small subset V (S) with the fundamental set V and the use set V (S) with the fundamental set V, and the use set S with the use set, and the use set S (S) with the fundamental set V."}, {"heading": "IV.

News Recommendation", "text": "A messaging recommendation system helps people quickly download the information they need. Specifically, it provides the most relevant and diversified messages to people by using their behavior as a submodular maximization problem. Based on the learning outcome, a classic greedy algorithm [4] has been implemented to provide a range of relevant articles to users. However, the large amount of data in the datasets prevents classical greedy algorithms from producing the solution in time due to their expensive computing costs. Additionally, it simplifies user reading behavior too much where it assumes that each user is reading a fixed number of articles per day."}, {"heading": "B. Scientific Literature Recommendation", "text": "Next, we present an application in the scientific literature that represents a scientific article. Researchers have to deal with an enormous amount of articles and gather information that interests them, where they have to filter the massive existing scientific literature and select the most useful ones. A common approach to finding the target literature is based on the so-called citation networks [24]. The authors in [24] map a citation network onto an evaluation matrix to filter research. In [25], an algorithm is proposed that transforms the random Walker properties into a probability matrix and the entries with the highest biased PageRank scores.We propose a new scientific literature system based on the newly proposed citation networks and streaming algorithms (Algorithm 4).

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a streaming algorithm to maximize a monotonous submodular function under a d-knapsack constraint. It leads to a (1 1 + 2d \u2212) approximation of the optimal value and requires only a single pass through the dataset and a small memory size. It achieves a large fraction of the usefulness value achieved by the greedy algorithm at significantly lower computational costs, making it very practical to implement. Our algorithm offers a more efficient way to solve the associated combinatorial optimization problems that many good applications could find, such as in the recommendations for news and scientific literature shown in the paper."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "We thank Dr. Nao Kakimura for comments that have greatly improved the manuscript."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Submodular maximization problems belong to the family of combinatorial optimization problems and enjoy wide applications.
