This, of course, leads to the question of whether restaurant reviews can support the process of public health inspection by identifying potentially risky restaurants that require more frequent inspections.To answer this question, we compare official results of inspections of Kitchener-Waterloo restaurants with text comments found in Yelp reviews of those restaurants. Specifically, we extract a number of key words and theme model features and apply them to some classification methods. Our extracted features can predict public health inspection with 90% accuracy when used with an assisting vector machine (SVM)."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "Kang et al.

The highest accuracy can be achieved by using only satisfied unigrams and bigrams. They presented keywords for various topics / categories such as hygienic."}, {"heading": "2 Data", "text": "In our study, we use Yelp4 and Waterloo Public Health (WPH) 5 data. We extract plant information and official inspection results (date, type, and recommended actions) from WPH. From Yelp, we extract business information (matched with WPH plant information) and tokenize text ratings. These tokens are used in a document term matrix and serve as characteristics in this work. The other characteristics are learned topic models, i.e. the distribution of topics for each topic learned. We use binary predictive labels: \"action\" that indicates non-compliance or some other major problem with the restaurant, and \"no action\" when the restaurant passes the health inspection."}, {"heading": "3 Approach", "text": "In fact, most people in the world are able to identify themselves and understand what they are doing.

Reducing the total number of keywords to an optimized subset in both the NBA and SVM approaches significantly improves performance, which is most likely to lead to potential overmatch in full. Given that both sensitivity and sensitivity are very high in our optimal system, there is strong evidence that this tool, or a very similar one, can be used by governments to optimize their resources. Specifically, inspection plans should be generated automatically from crowdsourced data, as in this work, and by default regulated procedures. Deriving such schedules is the subject of future work. Other possible ways of exploring include online sourcing interactive health reports, combined with crowd-inspection databases, and public health reports."}], "references": [{"title": "Twitter catches the flu", "author": ["E.
