This problem is to find the shortest path or tour subject for travelling a set of given subpaths. The current approaches for dealing with the subpath planning problem are all based on meta-heuristic approaches. It is well-known that meta-heuristic based approaches have several deficiencies. To address them, we propose a novel approximation algorithm in the O(n^3) time complexity class, which guarantees to solve any subpath planning problem instance with the fixed ratio bound of 2. Also, the formal proofs of the claims, our empirical evaluation shows that our approximation method acts much better than a state-of-the-art method, both in result and execution time.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 20 Mar 2016 14:22:26 GMT  (1815kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06217v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["masoud safilian", "s mehdi tashakkori", "sepehr eghbali", "aliakbar safilian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.06217"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.06217.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Approximation Approach for Solving the Subpath Planning Problem", "authors": ["Masoud Safilian", "S.

Automation of this process involves three steps: 1) capturing the surroundings of the actual problem and formulating this problem as an on-the-go planning problem; 2) solving the on-the-road planning problem in order to find the near-optimal path or near-optimal results; 3) commanding the robot to follow the result; the most difficult phase is the second that this paper attempts to master. In order to design effective automation for the above applications, it is essential to use methods with low computing costs but near-optimal results in the second phase. Due to the fact that the length of the final output has a direct impact on the cost of completion of the task, it is desirable to integrate methods with low complexity for the above applications, which we cannot guarantee the optimum results in this case between the length of the Xiv and the 3.06."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "There are a number of problems that both have to do with each other.

In a fixed sequence with n sub-paths, the ith (i < n) sub-path can be connected to the (i + 1) sub-path (the ninth sub-path is connected to the first one) in two different ways (either by head or tail). Consider an SPP instance with n-paths. Obviously, the number of possible sequences of these n-paths n!. Due to two different connections between two successive sub-paths, the total number of feasible solutions n! 2n.TSP would be one of the classic NP-hard problems of combinatorial optimization.

Transforming SPP to TSP allows us to use existing algorithms to solve TSP in the context of subpath planning. However, the violation of triangular inequality impedes the application of existing fixed-ratio approximation algorithms such as Christofides for SPP. To address this problem, we have proposed the IETI algorithm, which constitutes an essential subset of infringing triangles to satisfy the inequality condition in the triangle. IETI algorithm should be considered a fundamental step in proposing and applying bound approximation algorithms to solve SPP. With this method, a subset of SPP-bound approximation algorithms, called CSPP, can be proposed to find an almost optimal solution for SPP. CSPP solves TSP via the output graph of IETI algorithms CSPP is similar to the Christofixity algorithm algorithm, but in terms of the Christofixity algorithm algorithm."}, {"heading": "A Proofs of Lemma 3 and Lemma 5", "text": "The proofs for lemmas 3 and 5 are adapted to [6].

subpath planning problem is a branch of the path planning problem, which has widespread applications in automated manufacturing process as well as vehicle and robot navigation. This problem is to find the shortest path or tour subject for travelling a set of given subpaths. The current approaches for dealing with the subpath planning problem are all based on meta-heuristic approaches. It is well-known that meta-heuristic based approaches have several deficiencies. To address them, we propose a novel approximation algorithm in the O(n3) time complexity class, which guarantees to solve any subpath planning problem instance with the fixed ratio bound of 2. Beside the formal proofs of the claims, our empirical evaluation shows that our approximation method acts much better than a state-of-the-art method, both in result and execution time. Note to Practitioners\u2014In some real world applications such as robot and vehicle navigation in structured and industrial environments as well as some of the manufacturing processes such as electronic printing and polishing, it is required for the agent to travel a set of predefined paths. Automating this process includes three steps: 1) capturing the environment of the actual problem and formulating it as a subpath planning problem; 2) solving subpath planning problem to find the near optimal path or tour; 3) command the robot to follow the output. The most challenging phase is the second one that this paper tries to tackle it. To design an effective automation for the aforementioned applications, it is essential to make use of methods with low computational cost but near optimal outputs in the second phase. According to the fact that the length of the final output has a direct effect on the cost of performing the task, it is desirable to incorporate methods with low complexity that can guarantee a bound for the difference between length of the optimal path and 1 ar X iv :1 60 3. 06 21 7v 1 [ cs .R O ] 2 0 M ar 2 01 6 the output. Current approaches for solving subpath planning problem are all meta-heuristic based. These methods do not provide such a bound. And plus, they are usually very time consuming. They may find promising results for some instances of problems, but there is no guarantee that they always exhibit such a good behaviour. In this paper, in order to avoid the issues of metaheuristics methods, we present an approximation algorithm, which provides an appropriate bound for the optimality of its solution. To gauge the performance of proposed methods, we conducted a set of experiments the results of which show that our proposed method finds shorter paths in less time in comparison with a state-of-the-art method.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
