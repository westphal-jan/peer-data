Here, the links, i.e. the classes contained in the classification system along with their most likely thesaurus descriptors, are visualized as nodes in an interactive collapsible tree. Probabilistic link extraction is a verified topic model that takes into account multiple languages while limiting the themes of a document to its designations. In the context of this system, PLL-TM models two languages to create links between classes and descriptors."}, {"heading": "3 Application of the System in the Social Science Domain", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this project is a project, which is a project that is primarily a project, which is a project that is primarily a project."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we presented a system for probabilistic semantic linking of thesaurus descriptors with classes in a classification system. It consists of two components: (1) probabilistic semantic link generation using PLL-TM and (2) interactive visualization of the links. Identification and visualization of latent semantic links between two KOS is helpful in scenarios such as explorative classification browsing and as support during the indexing process. For future work, we plan to apply the system in different domains and evaluate the extracted links with human expert indexers. Furthermore, we plan to develop a (semi-) automatic annotation system that uses the links not only at the global KOS level, but proposes classes and a series of thesaurus descriptors for individual documents."}], "references": [{"title": "Collapsible Tree (2012 (accessed May 12, 2015))", "author": ["M.
