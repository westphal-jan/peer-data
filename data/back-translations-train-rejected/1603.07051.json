BACKGROUND", "text": "In this section we present some background information about TTP. The problem is formulated and an abstract algorithm is presented."}, {"heading": "A. The Travelling Thief Problem", "text": "In it, we formulate the Traveler Thief Problem (TTP), which combines two other known benchmark problems (namely, the Traveler Seller Problem (TSP) and the Knapsack Problem (KP). In TTP, we look at n cities and the associated distance matrix (dij). There are m elements scattered throughout these cities, each element k has a gain pk and a weight wk. A thief with his knapsack will visit all these cities (once and only once) and pick up some items to fill his knapsack. We note that the maximum capacity of the knapsack, vmin and vmax are the minimum and maximum possible speed wk. As an overall value, we also consider the following restrictions and parameters: \u2022 Each item is available in only one city. We note {Ai} the availability vector, Ai {1,..., n} contains the reference to the city that contains the element i. \u2022 We assume that the knapsack problem is corresponding to the city price."}, {"heading": "B. Cosolver", "text": "Cosolver is an abstract algorithm proposed in [2] to solve TTP. The idea behind the algorithm is simple. Disassemble the overall problem and solve the components separately using a fitness function that takes into account the interdependence between the two components. Thus, TTP is broken down into the following problems at an initial solution (x0, z0).1) The Travelling Salesman with Knapsack Problem (TSKP): is to find the best tour x, \"which in combination with the most recently found commission plan z\" optimizes the TTP target function G. Since the overall profit function also does not depend on the tour, instead of maximizing G, we can consider minimizing the total travel cost T (see Equation 3). T (x, z) = R \u0445 f (x, z) (3) 2) The knapsack problem on the route (KRP): is to find the best commission plan \"that maximizes the total gain\" when combining the last frame with the Cosolver."}, {"heading": "III. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "In this section, we propose an algorithm that implements the Cosolver framework and uses some techniques proposed in [11]."}, {"heading": "A. Solution initialization", "text": "For TTP, the initial solution has a major impact on the search algorithm, so the initialization strategy should be chosen carefully. In our implementation, we use a heuristic approach to initialize both the tour and the picking plan. First, the tour is generated using a good TSP algorithm such as the Lin-Kernighan heuristic [6] or the ant colony optimization algorithm [5], and then the picking plan is initialized with the following approach: 1) The fill heuristic proposed in [11] is used to fill the knapsack with items according to three fitness approximations. 2) A simple bit-flip search on inserted items is performed to eliminate some useless items from the picking plan using the objective function.We will call this heuristic insertion & elimination."}, {"heading": "B. Complexity reduction techniques", "text": "Our algorithm uses the following complexity reduction techniques: 1) TSKP Neighborhood Reduction: The Delaunay triangulation [4] is used as a candidate generator for 2-OPT heuristics; this strategy was also proposed in [11].2) Objective Value Restoration: Instead of using the objective function to calculate the objective value of neighbors, this value can be restored by tracking time and weight information in each city on the tour. \u2022 Time Register (treg): a vector containing the current time in each city on the tour. \u2022 Weight Register (wacc): a vector containing the current weight in each city on the tour. \u2022 Time Register (treg): a vector containing the additional time in each city on the tour. \u2022 Weight Register (wreg): a vector containing the additional weight in each city."}, {"heading": "C. Proposed algorithm", "text": "Our heuristics, Cosolver2B, is based on local search algorithms and implements the Cosolver framework. In addition to the techniques presented above, we use 2-OPT heuristics to solve the TSKP and a bit-flip search to solve the KRP. The algorithm is used in the flow chart in Figure 4.1http: / / cs.adelaide.edu.au / optlog / CEC2015Comp / The algorithm starts with a tour generated by LinKernigh heuristics. Insertion & elimination of heuristics is then used to initialize the picking plan. The tour and picking plan obtained is then given to the TSKP optimizer, which attempts to improve the current tour by means of 2-OPT heuristics. The resulting tour is combined with the current picking plan and given to the KRP optimizer, which uses a simple bit flip to find a decent picking plan."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "We tested our algorithm on 15 TTP instances of different sizes [13]. The results obtained are compared with RLS and EA, which were suggested in the same essay. We implemented two versions of Cosolver2B. The first is most suitable (also known as the best improvement), which scans the entire neighborhood on a particular iteration and selects the best neighbor. The second is firstly suitable (also known as the first improvement), which stops the neighborhood search.Since our algorithms are deterministic, one run per instance is sufficient. The algorithms have a maximum runtime limit of 600 seconds. Note that our implementation uses the Java platform, and the tests are performed on a core i3-2370M CPU 2.40 GHz machine with 4 GB of RAM, using Linux. On the other hand, due to their random behavior, 30 runs per instance were performed with RLS and EA. The tests on EA and RLS were performed on another machine."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our approach is based on the Cosolver framework and complexity reduction techniques. The experimental results show promising results both in terms of solution quality and runtime. The good performance of Cosolver2B and the MALTS memetic algorithm on a very large scale [11] shows how important it is to make strong assumptions about the problem area when it comes to multi-component problems. In addition, we are committed to improving our algorithm in terms of space exploration and runtime through the use of more sophisticated search heuristics."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors would like to thank the following people who contributed their useful comments to this work: Asmae El Ghazi, Aziz Ouaarab and Mehdi El Krari."}], "references": [{"title": "The travelling thief problem: the first step in the transition from theoretical problems to realistic problems", "author": ["Mohammad Reza Bonyadi", "Zbigniew Michalewicz", "Luigi Barone"], "venue": "In Evolutionary Computation (CEC),", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Socially inspired algorithms for the travelling thief problem", "author": ["Mohammad Reza Bonyadi", "Zbigniew Michalewicz", "Micha\u014f Roman Przyby\u014fek", "Adam Wierzbicki"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 2014 conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2014}, {"title": "A hybrid algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem with three-dimensional loading constraints", "author": ["Andreas Bortfeldt"], "venue": "Computers & Operations Research,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Sur la sphere vide", "author": ["Boris Delaunay"], "venue": "Izv.
