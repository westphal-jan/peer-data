An increasing number of historical data collections available in digital libraries require the development of tools and information systems in which the maps are used centrally. One of the most important characteristics of text documents is their weak data structure. The wide range of document types that can be used in historical research shows a lack of easily definable patterns, and when they exist, they are replaced by a central role in policy."}, {"heading": "2 Topic Maps-DITA Approach", "text": "The project in which this work is framed began as the development of an end-user recommendation system for the online product GEA (Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa), which helps the user retrieve information. Originally, the goal actually became a specialized processing tool for information on cultural heritage. The information provided by the online encyclopedians does not provide the minimum semantic labeling (see Figure 1) required for the development of the end-user tool. The lack of a semantic one, for example, is obvious and the language field < Description > needs to be analyzed more deeply because there is a lot of important information that depends on the context, such as events, dates, people, marriages, descendants, etc. Previously, a reprocessing of the above information had to be carried out."}, {"heading": "3 CONDITOR Engine Development", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Introduction", "text": "The main goal of the conditioner program is to read the XML source (see Figure 1), which in our case is an XML file format; to create entities that represent each of the source structure elements (objects) during this reading phase; to create an XML object with a different structure from these entities (see Figure 3); and finally to allow them to be stored in any system. Of course, this multifactor goal makes us think of numerous technologies that provide for automatic conversion of objects in this format, as well as automatic generation of objects in it. However, the problem that needs to be solved includes the possibility that the XML document reflects a semantic structure that performs such conversion of objects."}, {"heading": "3.2 Conditor Engine", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to move to another world in which they are able to find themselves."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2008, "abstractText": "Conditor is a software tool which works with textual documents containing historical information.
