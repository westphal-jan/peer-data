AIDED LINEAR IP FOR LOAD DISAGGREGATION", "text": "The proposed Linear Supported Intellectual Property (ALIP) on load-sharing includes several improvements over the intellectual property mentioned in (5) - (7), each of which will be discussed next."}, {"heading": "A. Additional Constraints", "text": "The first improvement includes additional constraints that help resolve ambiguities related to the possible non-uniqueness of the solution for IP. First, we consider devices such as refrigerators, surveillance cameras, smoke detectors, heat pumps, etc., that randomly switch between \"sleep mode\" and one or more higher power states. In other words, these devices always draw a certain power. We can include this additional information as an equality condition that needs to be added to (5) - (7), Eqxicon = 1 (8), where each row in the binary matrix Aeq has unit elements only in those positions that correspond to the states of these devices in vector xk that remain switched on at all times."}, {"heading": "B. Correction Based on State Transition Diagrams", "text": "Many devices work as finite state machines, and their possible state transitions can be described by a state transition diagram. Thus, for example, the refrigerator device from the data set in [12] has the state transition diagram shown in Fig. 1. This provides the ability to correct the output of an IP solver if it happens to violate the state transition diagram. For example, if BRD was in state s1 at k \u2212 1, then it can only be in s1 or s2 at k. If the output of an IP solver suggests otherwise, we know there must be an error, and can therefore choose either s1 or s2, depending on which of the two options in (5) results in lower costs for txk. The same type of correction can also be applied backwards (for example, the only way to get to s3 is either from s2 or s3), although we did not include such processing in our experiments."}, {"heading": "C. Median Filtering", "text": "The mean filtering can help to filter out implausible events such as frequent switching between states, which may occur in the 3 s 1 s 2s 4s 3s 3Fig. 1. State transition diagram of the FRG of [12].IP solver output, when the VA values of a particular device are much smaller than the total VA value zk. Consider the device B1E of [12], which has a fully connected 2-state diagram (Fig. 1 deleted with states s3 and s4).Although a transition between these two states is possible, it is unlikely that the device will change the state at each sample moment; we expect it to remain in a state for at least a few sample moments. To enforce this, we apply the correction rules k \u2212 L = {s1 if s-k = s2 and med (s-k = s2 and med (s-k = s2 and med (s-k = s2 and med (s-k) k-k, i.e., if state k-k-k is applied)."}, {"heading": "D. Linear Programming-Based Refinement", "text": "As already mentioned, the vector r contains constant state evaluations that could be obtained from the data sheets or measurements of the devices. (However, VA values for transients between states are usually much more difficult to obtain, and even if this were possible, including transient state evaluations in the model would vastly increase the model size (i.e. the number of states). However, if the sampling instance randomly captured a transient from one or more devices, this could lead to a flawed IP solution. For this reason, we are developing a method to refine the IP solution using only the minimum and maximum transient VA evaluations of each device, which is easier to obtain, either from the data sheet or the measurement. Let rmin and rmax be the vectors of the same size as r, each containing minimum and maximum transient VA evaluations for each state."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "This year, it will be able to take the lead, \"he said in an interview with the Taiwanese daily La."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Integer Programming (IP) provides a natural way to solve the problem of load fragmentation by trying to determine which device states are active at a given time. However, earlier IP-based fragmentation of real data encountered problems due to problems associated with temporary measurements and in cases where some states are binary combinations of other states. We proposed a supported linear IP (ALIP) fragmentation approach that overcomes many of the shortcomings of the previous IP-based approach. Experimental results show significant accuracy advantages of ALIP over the previous IP-based fragmentation method, as well as competitiveness over two state-of-the-art machine learning-based fragmentation approaches."}], "references": [{"title": "and B", "author": ["S.
