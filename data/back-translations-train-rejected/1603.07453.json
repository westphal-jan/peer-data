For example, when we say that the probability of \"heads\" after a coin flip is 50%, and that of \"tails\" is 50%, we implicitly assume that there is an action (in this example, a coin is flipped) that can take the world to the next moment. Uncertainty lies in the transition phase: the world can end in a state where the coin shows the tails."}, {"heading": "2 Syntax", "text": "The goal of PTL language is to be sufficiently expressive to capture typical probability statements that are comfortably similar to natural language and yet more precise than natural language in cases where the latter is ambiguous. Intuitively, probability is an inherently higher function, since it takes a statement (representing an event) as an argument. Thus, if a probable logical language is to include a probability operator at the syntactic level, it is only natural that it should be a language of higher order, since thinking probably involves numerical compilation and reasoning about states and actions, it is convenient to have a typed language with different basic types of numbers, states, and actions. The types used here are predominantly known simple types, but a list constructor is also included to represent temporary actions and propositions.Types are freely generated from the set of basic types."}, {"heading": "3 Semantics", "text": "For each type we use as a basis for the modal aspects of seasickness, a framework of states and relationships between the various states is necessary.

The first is syntactical. While the usual language of classical probability theory (which is based on fixed expressions) can of course express formulas containing propositional connections such as negation, conjunction, and disjunction (by reversing the translation function g defined in the proof of the theory), in the language of PTL there are formulas (e.g. formulas containing quantifiers or nested probability operators) that have no (natural) counterpart in the language of classical probability theory. The second is semantic: the proof of Theorem 4.5 shows that probability spaces correspond to models with a very simple framework; it would be inconvenient to express models with more complex frames in relation to probability spaces, because the frame structure would have to be flat."}, {"heading": "5.1 Independence", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one is able to follow the rules that one applies in practice.

If a person A tries to describe to a person B the accidental effects of an action a, its description might include a sentence such as: \"the probability of a sentence after a is p.\" However, the simplest and most literal logical meaning for this sentence would be Pa (B) = p. However, it is often the case that the meaning meant by A is actually a sentence. B must guess from the context of conversation and common knowledge which of the two alternatives actually means.A formula such as \"Pa\" provides fine-grained information about a particular state transition that is possible through the action, while Pa (B) = pseudonymically aggregated aggregated information about transitions to all states in which we hold it is incomplete. The aggregated information is incomplete because it does not say how many such states exist and does not specify the probability of transition to each of these states."}, {"heading": "6 Implementation and Automation", "text": "A provisional implementation of PTL in Coq is available at https: / / github.com / Paradoxes / ProbLogic. It follows the embedding methodology used in [1,2], which is based on a higher-order and typed version of the standard translation of modal logic into predicate logic, with three important differences. First, while in the standard translation the accessibility relationship is a primitive constant, in the embedding of PTL it is derived from the primitive concept of action. Second, the higher order modal logic used in [1] was rigid, while PTL contains a flexible probability function P (which is simulated by a flexible predicate in the implementation). Finally, unlike the logic of [1], PTL requires numerical reasoning (this last point makes the embedding of PTL considerably more difficult than previous embedding and justifies its provisional status."}, {"heading": "7 The Monty Hall Problem", "text": "PTL is used here to formalize vos Savant's famous Monty Hall problem [10], the description of which is as follows: Suppose we are at a game show and we have a choice between three doors: behind one door there is a car, behind the other goats."}, {"heading": "1, and the host, who knows what\u2019s behind the doors, opens another door, say", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world in which they will be able to move."}, {"heading": "8 Related Work", "text": "Probabilistic modal logic described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of [5] is probably the most similar to PTL. However, they are propositional, lack the probabilistic diamond operator and are atempor.Probabilistic logic involving time includes PCTL [8,4], which expands the CTL by replacing the existential and universal path quantifiers with a probabilistic operator. PCTL is an excellent logic for checking Markov chains. However, the lack of a probabilistic diamond operator makes them vulnerable to the problems discussed in Section 5.2, limiting their use beyond modality verification, and lacks the explicit handling of actions required for the convenient formalities of diamond operators, as well as the minimal time required only for the practical TL operator."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "The large number of probabilistic logics available suggests that the mediation of logic and probability is a non-trivial task. PTL, the expressive probabilistic temporal logic described here, offers a novel alternative approach based on the simple intuition that the concept of probability can only be fully grasped in combination with the concepts of action and time. Of course, the complex interaction of time, action and probability leads to a higher order modal logic. PTL is adequate in terms of classical probability theory, from which it can be considered an extension (as shown in Section 4, where a correspondence between events and formulas was detailed).The convenient expressiveness of PTL enabled a natural formalization of the famous Monty Hall problem. One of the most important insights in the development of PTL came with the discovery of the need for both a higher probability function and a probability formalization of PTL."}], "references": [{"title": "Automating g\u00f6del\u2019s ontological proof of god\u2019s existence with higher-order automated theorem provers", "author": ["C.
