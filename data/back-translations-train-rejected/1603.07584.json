An l1 regularization term enforces the sparsity constraint while we recover the sources of diffusion from a single snapshot of the diffusion process. The diffusion ker- nel is estimated by assuming the process to be as generic as the standard heat diffusion. We show with synthetic data that we can concomitantly learn the diffusion kernel and the sources, given an estimated initialization. We validate our model with cholera mortality and atmospheric tracer diffusion data, showing also that the accuracy of the solution depends on the construction of the graph from the data points.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 14:15:17 GMT  (2851kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07584v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 19 Nov 2016 08:56:13 GMT  (2797kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07584v2", "5 pages, 5 figures, published in \"Image, Video, and Multidimensional Signal Processing Workshop (IVMSP), 2016 IEEE 12th\""]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["rodrigo pena", "xavier bresson", "pierre vandergheynst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07584"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.07584.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "SOURCE LOCALIZATION ON GRAPHS VIA `1 RECOVERY AND SPECTRAL GRAPH THEORY", "authors": ["Rodrigo Pena", "Xavier Bresson", "Pierre Vandergheynst"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index Terms - Source Localization, Diagram, Dispersion, Optimization"}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to move to another world in which they are able to find themselves."}, {"heading": "2. PROBLEM SETUP", "text": "We consider undirected, weighted graphs G = (V, E, W), consisting of a series of nodes V = >, a series of edges E and a weighted adjacence matrix W. Each entry Wij of W represents the weight of the edge between nodes i, j, V, with Wij = 0 if wells i and j are not connected. Since G is undirected, W is a symmetrical matrix. The sparse signal representing the sources of diffusion is a function x: V \u2192 R with support in a subset of V. Let D be a diagonal matrix with Entrys Dii = jWij, and call it the Graphic Degree Matrix. The standardized graph Laplacian [10] is then defined as L = I \u2212 D \u2212 1 / 2WD \u2212 1 / 2. By construction, we assume that the graph Laplacian is symmetrically and positively defined."}, {"heading": "2.1. Error measure", "text": "We define an error measurement based on hop distances similar to those given in [8]. Let x: V \u2192 R be the reference signal, with non-zero values (spikes) at the source node, and let y: V \u2192 R be the test signal. Let us also let A V, which we call the active node set, contain nodes with peaks in x. For each i-A, let us define a set of Ni V containing the nodes in V, which are closer to i than any other element of A. Let us call the set Ni the sphere of influence of the node i. The distance h (i, j) between two nodes i, j-V is measured in hops, as the shortest path in G between i and j. The average hop error between these signals can then be written as ase (x, y)."}, {"heading": "3. RESULTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Sensor Graph", "text": "Sensor diagrams are constructed by first selecting random points on the plane and then connecting each of them to its nearest k neighbors (k-NN).The weight of the edge between two nodes, i and j, is given by exp (\u2212 d (i, j) 2\u03c32), where d (i, j) is the euclidean distance between their respective coordinates, and \u03c32 is a scaling factor. We first analyze the accuracy of the solution to (2) with respect to both peak distances, h, and diffusion times, \u03b8. For each pair (h, \u03b8) and for each experiment, we first randomly select two peaks, h hops away from each other, on a 250-node sensor diagram. We then diffuse (1) parameters to diffuse this peak signal to obtain observation b. We recover a sparse signal from this observation by solving it (2), and measure the error of this solution in relation to the originally drawn peaks."}, {"heading": "3.2. John Snow\u2019s Cholera Data", "text": "We believe that a major cholera outbreak in the District of Soho, in London, triggered a groundbreaking study by the father of modern epidemiology, the physician John Snow [12]. He is skeptical of the miasma theory of diseases prevailing at the time, he hypothesized that cholera was transmitted by water, reinforced by the observation that the homes of the infected people were around a water pump on the wide street.Snow used a map of the region to illustrate how cholera cases were distributed around the infected pump, which was recently transformed into a modern geographical information system (GIS) and made available in a blog post by Robin Wilson. In this map there are 250 points marked with cholera deaths, each of which has an associated death toll ranging from 1 to 15, resulting in a total of 489 deaths."}, {"heading": "3.3. European Tracer Experiment (ETEX) Data", "text": "In the years following the Chernobyl accident, the European Community became very interested in monitoring and modelling the atmospheric transport of chemicals, particularly radionuclides. One of the studies designed in this context was the European Tracer Experiment (ETEX) [14], which took place in 1994. It consisted of two separate runs of the same protocol: release from near Rennes, FR, easily identifiable tracers (perfluorocarbons) in the atmosphere, and their concentration over a period of 72 consecutive hours at 168 ground stations in Western and Eastern Europe. Figure 4 shows a network of these ground stations, superimposed on a map of Europe. The network is composed as a k-NN diagram, but this time the distance between the points is simply calculated as the Euclidean distance between their coordinates on the globe. (a) The non-zero signal that releases the tracer (ground truth)."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION", "text": "We have introduced a framework for solving source localization problems on graphs, which is robust to noise and source removal, but can be very sensitive to the diffusion time of the heat core, and this sensitivity can perhaps be attenuated if we allow observations in different time steps during the diffusion process. In future work, more complex diffusion models could perhaps be tested in dealing with real data to obtain better behavior from the non-convex problem. Thus, for example, Bertuzzo et al. [15] are developing a fairly detailed dynamic model of cholera epidemics in networks. Finally, we have also seen that the results depend on the construction of the graph from the given data. Graph construction from data points is still an open problem, but there is some interesting work in this area, e.g. [16], [17], [18]."}, {"heading": "5.
