RELATED WORK", "text": "Traditional recommendation systems focus on increasing the accuracy of predicting the rating of items that have not yet been viewed by active users, based on reviews of items that have already been viewed by active users. However, in [7], McNee et al. stated that it is not enough to focus solely on improving the accuracy of the rating of recommended items in order to improve user satisfaction. Factors such as range, variety, novelty and / or randomness should be used to improve the recommendations, with the aim of improving conventional recommendation systems while working with important factors outside the rating of items, Xiv: 160 3.07 849v 1 [cs.I R] 25 Mar 201 6PR EPRI NTaccuracy, many studies that develop a new paradigm of recommendation making have been proposed in the literature. We discuss briefly related works that provide cators outside the accuracy of recommendation systems and surveys that have undertaken new experiments in the field of recommendation systems."}, {"heading": "III. THE NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION", "text": "In fact, it is a way in which most people are able to put themselves in the world."}, {"heading": "IV. PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "We propose to apply a similar approach of text classification [14], which was discussed in the previous section, to predict the genres of movies. [This prediction is possible due to the fact that users are generally in tune with their preferences and prefer some genres to others. Below, we present symbols and definitions used in this section. Let U be the set of all users, M be the set of all movies and G be the set of genres. The movie m-M is characterized by | U | dimensional feature vector rm = {Ru1, m, Ru2, m, m, m} where R is the set of all movies and G is the set of genres. The movie m-M is characterized by | U-dimensional feature vector rm = {Ru1, Ru2, m, m} where R rating matrix and Rui, m is either a 0 or a 1, depending on whether the user reviews a movie."}, {"heading": "V. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION", "text": "In order to increase the effectiveness of the proposed methods for predicting user numbers, we need to increase the number of reviews we have received to one million. A rating of 1 indicates that a user does not like a film. Experiments were carried out using the following method: a part of the films were randomly selected and the remaining films were used to assess the quality of the films."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Recommender systems are tools whose purpose is to help users overcome information overload by selecting the most interesting information based on users \"preferences and helping companies sell more products. In this article, we suggested predicting a movie genre rather than predicting movie ratings. To this end, we used Nave Baye's classifier and a multinomial event model previously used for text classification and a number of other tasks. This approach can potentially improve the efficiency of recommendations by recommending movies from unexpected but relevant genres; this will be investigated in further research. We showed that the genre prediction rate increases as the size of training data increases, but the prediction rate slows down. Even a small number of users enables a significant increase in genre prediction. Overall, we have successfully applied ratings for genre predictions in the context of movies."}], "references": [{"title": "A survey of collaborative filtering techniques,", "author": ["X.
