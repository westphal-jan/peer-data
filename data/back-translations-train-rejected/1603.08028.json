They assume that both the anonymized and the auxiliary diagrams are taken from a common underlying Erdo \ufffd s Re \ufffd nyi random diagram, which results in a structural correlation between the two diagrams. They derive sufficient conditions for the model parameters under which the two diagrams can be accurately related to each other. Specifically, they prove that the average degree needs to grow only slightly faster than the logarithm of the order of the network in order to achieve perfect deanonymization. A similar problem was considered by Ji et alexos. In order to generate the correlated diagrams, the sampling process was used as in [26], but the underlying graph graph will grow only slightly faster than the network needs to achieve a complete logarization order."}, {"heading": "3.2 Community Detection Applications", "text": "3.2.1 Privacy control [15] Information sharing in an OSN, such as photos, status, emotions and location, is a common practice for individuals who use the network. An individual's social contacts can fall into different categories, such as family, friends, colleagues and even finer subgroups. However, users can only share their information among a specific group of contacts. Therefore, it becomes important that users can share their information selectively through such networks. Recently, community rebuilding has been proposed as a tool to solve this problem. Community is a group of closely connected users where tightness can be measured by different metrics for different types of groups. For example, a close friendship community is characterized by frequent sharing of messages. These metrics can be automatically exploited to identify and label communities that enable users to share their information selectively. 3.2.2 Sampling in OSNs [29] The popularity of OSNs has grown beyond imagination, and the size of these networks has grown into millions of users."}, {"heading": "4. SYSTEM MODEL", "text": "In this section we will discuss the system model, followed by the description of the de-anonymization attack and the derivation of the maximum a posteriori estimator. First, we will discuss a few preliminaries. 4.1 Preliminaries For a graph G should be V (G) or E (G) the node and the edge set, respectively. Let [n] denote the sentence {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, n}. All n-vertex graphs we look at will have the vertex set [n]. These numeric vertex labels should not be confused with the vertex labels (or alternatively the labels) that come from the problem domain. Examples of these labels include names and private information. To anonymize the graph G2, we must remove the relationship between the numerical vertex and the user identities. To do this, we apply a uniform random permutation to the numerical vertex. We will always think of a function that [is defined as a] permutation."}, {"heading": "4.2 Generative Model for Correlated Graphs", "text": "Recall the description of the problem in Section 1. There are two n-vertex diagrams, G1 and G2. An attacker has access to a pair of correlated diagrams G1 and \u03c0 (G2), which are both defined on the same vertex set and denote the identities of the users. In this case, it is a uniformly random permulation of [n]. The vertex of the auxiliary graph G1, which is available to the attacker, is denoted by user identities, but not by sensitive information. The vertex of the sensitive diagram G2, which is not available to the attacker, is denoted by sensitive information. The anonymized diagram \u03c0 (G2) is available to the attacker, but the numerical vertex labels do not contain information about user identities, as it is a uniformly random permutation. The vertex in G1 and the vertex in the M number in the same vertex G. correspond to the user's G2."}, {"heading": "4.3 Attack Model", "text": "Remember that G1 is the auxiliary chart and G2 is the sensitive chart. An opponent aims to deanonymize \u03c0 (G2) using G1. A successful anonymization attack can be described as a mapping from the nodes of G1 to the nodes of \u03c0 (G2), i.e. a map \u03c0 (G2). A successful anonymization attack is the true mapping of all graphics in both graphics. 2 We say that a permutation preserves the community structure if it is only interested in other 2As maps vertices, assuming that the opponent knows the true names of all graphics. 2 Given the anonymized chart (G2), the opponent must be able to perform the community structure with high probability."}, {"heading": "5. CONDITIONS FOR ANONYMITY", "text": "We will analyze the anonymity of graph \u03c0 (G2) with the SBM community structure for the attack model described in Section 4.3 (b = q q =).

SUBLINEAR COMMUNITIES", "text": "So far, we have considered only graphs with a constant number of communities, or communities with a number of linkages linearly in n. In the real world graphs, the structure of the community arises for a variety of reasons. For example, a community derived from the common interest in some popular media could easily be linear in size. We have assumed that the adversary is able to recognize the community structure in both public and anonymized graphs, and to match a community in one graph correctly with a community in the other. If C is constant, the mapping of the community level reduces the anonymity of a single vertex by an asymptogically negligible amount. Without mapping the community level, log2 n bits are required to describe the corresponding vertex in another graph."}, {"heading": "8. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "In this section, we examine the trade-off between benefit and privacy for both synthetic and real networks. The goal of this section is twofold: first, to show that when the terms of our conversation are met, most cornerstones of the network will still remain anonymous; second, to demonstrate the existence of real networks that will help rebuild the community without sacrificing the privacy of most users."}, {"heading": "8.1 Results for SBM", "text": "The choice of this algorithm is motivated by the fact that its performance is guaranteed for random graphs. Other algorithms in the literature are reasonable and their performance is highly dataset-dependent. As the structure of an SBM network is fairly uniform, the structural properties used by heuristic algorithms are present only in very few places. Percolation algorithms start with the number of seed nodes, and incrementally the remaining pair of nodes is measured using a threshold controlled by parameters r 2. A large value of r ensures smaller de-anonymization, but requires a large number of seeds to percolate. Conversely, small values of r make percolation easier, but increase error rates. We analyze the performance of this algorithm on the networks of the SBM family with two communities. We provide the algorithms with selected numbers."}, {"heading": "8.2 Results for Real Network", "text": "We look at a dataset and examine its usefulness and privacy by varying the substamping parameters. We look at the Facebook network [16], which contains 4039 users and 88234 edges. The average number of clustering coefficients is 0.6055 and fraction of closed triangles is 0.2647, indicating a strong community structure. We expect the community structure of the dataset to be resistant to edge stamp perturbations. We describe the experimental methodology and results in the following subsections. Our first goal is to investigate the effects of the edge subsampling structure on the community structure. The original dataset will be used using the substampling parameters t = 0.5, 0.7, 0.7, 0.9. Since there are no basic truth communities for the network, we use the communities that are recognized as our basic truth in the original network. To recognize the communities, we use the freely available software Pajek [2], we use the communities we created."}, {"heading": "9. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we considered the problem of the deanonymizability of networks and established an information-theoretical converse for the exact deanonymizability. This result applies to each deanonymization algorithm and thus represents a fundamental boundary for this statistical estimation problem. This differs qualitatively from the existing work in this area. We also improve the state of the art in terms of accessibility conditions, where considerable efforts have already been invested in the development of efficient algorithms and information-theoretically optimal methods. In particular, our reversibility and accessibility boundaries have the same parameter dependencies. For exact deanonymization, the boundaries correspond to a factor of 2. Our work supports the idea that the intersection graph of auxiliary and sensitive networks plays a fundamental role in controlling the feasibility of deanonymization. This contributes to the existing evidence from [28], where this intersection plays a decisive role in the analysis of percolation algorithms."}, {"heading": "10. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] E. Abbe, A.

We ask the question \u201cDoes there exist a regime where the network cannot be deanonymized perfectly, yet the community structure could be learned?.\u201d To answer this question, we derive information theoretic converses for the perfect deanonymization problem using the Stochastic Block Model and edge sub-sampling. We also provide an almost tight achievability result for perfect deanonymization. We also evaluate the performance of percolation based deanonymization algorithm on Stochastic Block Model datasets that satisfy the conditions of our converse. Although our converse applies to exact deanonymization, the algorithm fails drastically when the conditions of the converse are met. Additionally, we study the effect of edge sub-sampling on the community structure of a real world dataset. Results show that the dataset falls under the purview of the idea of this paper. There results suggest that it may be possible to prove stronger partial deanonymizability converses, which would enable better privacy guarantees.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
