To achieve this goal, most previous efforts have focused mainly on questionnaires, which are time-consuming and costly. The tremendous volume of product reviews on e-commerce websites has seen a new trend emerge, whereby manufacturers attempt to understand user preferences by analyzing online reviews. Following this trend, this paper addresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently developed opinion mining techniques. This work is novel for three reasons. First, questionnaire-based investigation is automatically enabled by employing algorithms for template-based question generation and opinion mining-based answer extraction. Using this system, manufacturers are able to obtain reports of customer behavior featuring a much larger sample size, more direct information, a higher degree of automation, and a lower cost. Second, international customer behavior study is made easier by integrating tools for multilingual opinion mining. Third, this is the first time an automatic questionnaire investigation has been conducted to compare customer behavior in China and America, where product reviews are written and read in Chinese and English, respectively. Our study on digital cameras, smartphones, and tablet computers yields three findings. First, Chinese customers follow the Doctrine of the Mean, and often use euphemistic expressions, while American customers express their opinions more directly. Second, Chinese customers care more about general feelings, while American customers pay more attention to product details. Third, Chinese customers focus on external features, while American customers care more about the internal features of products.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Mar 2016 08:57:22 GMT  (959kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08089v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.CL cs.HC", "authors": ["qingqing zhou", "rui xia", "chengzhi zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08089"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.08089.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Online shopping behavior study based on multi-granularity opinion mining: China vs. America", "authors": ["Qingqing Zhou"], "emails": ["zhangcz@njust.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "To achieve this goal, most efforts to date have focused mainly on questionnaires, which are time-consuming and costly, and the huge volume of product reviews on e-commerce websites has created a new trend in which manufacturers try to understand user behavior by analyzing online reviews.

Manufacturers see customer behavior as a key factor in making decisions about product design and marketing; transactional companies also see it as important to conduct questionnaire-based customer behavior surveys; most existing customer behavior surveys are conducted through manually managed questionnaires, which is costly, time-consuming and error-prone; nowadays, there is a huge volume of product ratings available on e-commerce websites, and manufacturers try to understand user preferences by accessing online customer ratings. For example, C & A Marketing 1 analyzes product ratings on Amazon to understand users \"needs, and then uses this information to design new products. To that end, product reviews can reveal customers\" attitudes and preferences in different regions. Two illustrative reviews of the Apple iPhone 5s are shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to a different world in which they are able to escape than to another world in which they are able to escape."}, {"heading": "2.3.1 Document-level sentiment analysis", "text": "In order to predict whether the document as a whole expresses a positive or negative mood [59], one of two learning methods is used: supervised and unsupervised. In our case, many existing supervised learning methods can be used [38]. For example, Mullen and Collier have used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform a mood analysis combining various sources of potentially relevant information [34]. To improve the accuracy of the mood classification, some specific mood analysis techniques have been proposed, including those by Xia et al. [54, 56, 53, 55], Li et al. [23], Nakagawa et al. [37] and Maas et al. [30]. One of the most classical uncontrolled learning approaches for mood analysis was suggested by Turney et al. [48]. In their work, they have compiled syntactical patterns that people used to express opinions based on parts of the speech, and subsequently conducted a mood analysis based on a negative mood analysis, which was called a reverse mood analysis."}, {"heading": "2.3.2 Aspect-level sentiment analysis", "text": "Instead of providing isolated opinions on a product, customers tend to compare specific characteristics of products. Therefore, it is necessary to perform an aspect-oriented sentiment analysis [28], including aspect-oriented extraction and aspect-oriented sensitization of ratings [42]. Jo and Oh developed the sentiment-LDA model and the aspect-and-sentiment-unification model (ASUM) for evaluations of electronic devices and restaurants. Their results showed that ASUM trumped other generative models and carried out classification models in a similar manner. Moghaddam and Este developed design guidelines for aspect-based opinion formation (ASUM)."}, {"heading": "3 Data collection", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "5 Empirical study", "text": "The results of our study are presented in Section 5.1.

We generate questions and extract answers automatically using multi-granularity opinion mining. Three important conclusions can be drawn from our analysis: (1) Chinese customers follow the doctrine of mean and often use euphemistic terms, while American customers use more direct expressions. (2) American customers pay more attention to product details than Chinese customers (3) Chinese customers pay more attention to external characteristics, while American customers pay more attention to internal characteristics. We examine differences between Chinese and American online shopping behavior based on reviews on e-commerce websites. This method can be expanded to examine differences between Chinese and American consumers on other websites, and differences between users from other countries or regions. In a word: This is a study of exploring differences in customer behavior based on reviews on e-commerce websites.

now being sold worldwide, and manufacturers are eager to obtain a better understanding of customer behavior in various regions. To achieve this goal, most previous efforts have focused mainly on questionnaires, which are time-consuming and costly. The tremendous volume of product reviews on e-commerce websites has seen a new trend emerge, whereby manufacturers attempt to understand user preferences by analyzing online reviews. Following this trend, this paper addresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently developed opinion mining techniques. This work is novel for three reasons.
