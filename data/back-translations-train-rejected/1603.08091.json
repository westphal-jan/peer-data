However, these approaches lack content-level information and cannot determine the citation intentions of users. Meanwhile, the abundant online review resources concerning academic books can be used to mine deeper information and content utilizing altmetric perspectives. In this study, we measure the impacts of academic books by multi-granularity mining online reviews, and we identify factors that affect a book's impact. First, online reviews of a sample of academic books on Amazon.cn are crawled and processed. Then, multi-granularity review mining is conducted to identify review sentiment polarities and aspects' sentiment values. Lastly, the numbers of positive reviews and negative reviews, aspect sentiment values, star values, and information regarding helpfulness are integrated via the entropy method, and lead to the calculation of the final book impact scores. The results of a correlation analysis of book impact scores obtained via our method versus traditional book citations show that, although there are substantial differences between subject areas, online book reviews tend to reflect the academic impact. Thus, we infer that online reviews represent a promising source for mining book impact within the altmetric perspective and at the multi-granularity content level. Moreover, our proposed method might also be a means by which to measure other books besides academic publications.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Mar 2016 09:25:16 GMT  (763kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08091v1", "21pages,3 figures, 12 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "21pages,3 figures, 12 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL", "authors": ["qingqing zhou", "chengzhi zhang", "star x zhao", "bikun chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08091"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.08091.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Measuring Book Impact Based on the Multi-granularity Online Review Mining", "authors": ["Qingqing Zhou", "X.

Garfield (1972) used citation analysis as a tool in evaluating journals and found that journals can be classified by frequency and effect of citations. Stremersch et al. (2007) demonstrated that citations were drivers of the impact of articles by contrasting, synthesizing and testing three scientometric perspectives on the influence of article and author attributes on article citations at the same time. However, few previous studies have paid much attention to assessing the impact of books. Torres-Salinas et al. (2012) analyzed various impact indicators relied on by scientific publishers and included in the Book Citation Index for the Social Sciences and Humanities during 2006-2011."}, {"heading": "Alternative impact assessments", "text": "Traditional, citation-based bibliometric methods are proving increasingly inadequate in the age of Web 2.0, and many researchers are looking for alternative metrics to evaluate different qualities of academic publications. Kousha et al. (2010) introduced a new, combined, integrated online impact indicator and concluded that it can be used to monitor research performance. Torres-Salinas et al. (2012) analyzed the various impact indicators that book publishers refer to in the Book Citation Index, while Gorraiz et al. (2013) introduced the Book Citation Index in detail, and Gorraiz et al. (2014) found that book reviews can be considered an appropriate criterion for such a citation index. Bornmann (2014) outlined whether legacy metric data could be used validly to measure societal impacts, and whether the scientific measures of societal impacts of books can be measured with a comprehensive set of data from different sources."}, {"heading": "Online review mining", "text": "To assess the impact of books on online reviews from e-commerce or social networking sites, a data mining method is used to process these reviews. As a burgeoning research topic, review mining has already attracted a broad range of theories and technologies, including Shi and Chang (2006) extracting product feature orientation pairs (sentiment) from online product reviews, and Ding et al. (2008) determining the semantic orientations (positive, negative or neutral) of opinions expressed in reviews using a holistic lexicon-based approach to product features. Chaovalit and Zhou (2005) compared monitored and unmonitored classification approaches of film reviews, while Zhuang et al. (2006) integrated WordNet, statistical analysis and film knowledge to determine whether opinions were positive or negative. Specifically, with regard to books, Chevalier and Mayzlin (2006) examined the impact of consumer reviews on Amazon.com."}, {"heading": "Research questions", "text": "This study aims to introduce a methodology for measuring the impact of academic books based on online content and sentiment analysis. In the empirical part of the study, we also try to assess whether online reviews are useful for assessing the impact of academic books. Further research questions are answered as follows: Are online book reviews a sufficient measure of the impact of academic books? Which category of aspects most influence the impact of books: content-related aspects, publisher-related aspects or user-related aspects? For example, content, price and packaging belong to these three categories. If a book is published well or sold on a good e-commerce platform, more people can access and read it. Therefore, publisher-related aspects and user-related aspects must be taken into account as well as content-related aspects. Do disciplinary differences influence the answers to the above questions?"}, {"heading": "Methodology Data collection", "text": "Academic books were used as research examples and, along with their quotations, were selected using Su's (2011) \"A Report on the Academic Impact of Chinese Books on the Humanities and Social Sciences,\" which covers 20 academic disciplines of Chinese books in the humanities and social sciences. References to each book in the report cover its academic discipline, author, publication year and quotation, the latter being collected by the Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index 2. http: / cssci.cn / For this study, 544 economic books, 216 management books and information sciences (LIS) books, 137 books and 428 books of literature were evaluated. Most traditional reviews in this context are scientific book reviews. Such reviews are driven by the book title, publisher, publisher, page circumference and price."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The primary purpose of this study is to determine how and if it is feasible to measure the impact of academic books through the multi-granularity mining of online book reviews. Fig. 2 summarizes the overall framework of book impact measurement and correlation analysis of information from review holders. (2) Factor calculation. Ratings range from one to five stars on Amazon.cn. Multi-granularity sentiment analysis of review content can be classified into \"macro\" and \"mikro\" levels. Specifically, the macro-level sentiment analysis is performed to calculate the number of positive and negative correlations."}, {"heading": "Factor calculation", "text": "As stated in Table 3, five factors have been calculated for the Review holder and Review holder & Reviewer evaluator, the difference between the two parts being whether or not a review of helpfulness has been considered, and the calculation methods used for each aspect are given in this paragraph. Calculation of the number of positive and negative ratings has been used to calculate the numbers of positive and negative ratings. First, word segmentation 3 has been applied to the ratings, and then the term frequency of the document (TF-IDF) method (Salton and McGill 1983) has been applied to select the segmented words to improve classification performance."}, {"heading": "Multi-level correlation analysis", "text": "In this study, two levels of correlation were analysed: firstly, we performed a correlation analysis of the book impact values obtained with our method compared to those obtained with book quotations to find the most correlated combination and thereby prove the reliability of our method; secondly, a correlation analysis was performed between the aspect mood values of each category and the citations of the books in order to determine which aspect categories have the most influence on book impact."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The results of the correlation analysis of the \"Review holder only\" and \"Review holder & Review evaluator\" parts.

The macro-review holder and the macro-holder has one significant macro-level ranking holder, the macro-review leholder has one significant macro-holder, and one significant macro-holder."}, {"heading": "Categories Aspects", "text": "The results of the correlation analysis of citations and the mood values of grouped aspects are in Table 12. Overall, aspect mood values in economics, management and LIS show significant Pearson correlations with citations, while aspect mood values in psychology and literature show no significant correlation. These results are almost identical to those in Tables 8 and 10, supporting the conclusion that differences between disciplines lead to the phenomenon of correlation differences.The highest correlations between citations and grouped aspect mood values in economics, management and LIS are content-related aspects (0.389, 0.437 and 0.474), followed by operational-related aspects (0.350, 0.366 and none).This finding may indicate that the content and translations of books are very important for improving their academic impact and that the choice of a better operator (with good logistics and good service) is also imperative."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Compared to quotation-based rating methods, our approach uses content information by applying multi-level online rating methods, so it is not simply an analysis of the number of quotations, but also an attempt to discover the meaning of each quote by extracting content information. Therefore, we believe that online reviews can be a useful resource in assessing the academic impact of books. Compared to valuation methods based on scientific reviews, the rating corpus of our method is much larger, as online reviews are updated in a variety and fast manner. As technologies that deal with web crawling are developed, the cost of collecting online reviews is reduced. In addition, online reviews are made available to the public, which directly reflects the attitudes and opinions of book users. This viewpoint, as opposed to traditional impact measurements, leads to a much broader observation of book impacts."}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "Our study is subject to some limitations. First, its scope was limited to five academic disciplines (economics, management, LIS, psychology, and literature), which were selected as academic books in these disciplines and usually attract more online reviews than books from other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities - hence its selection as a dataset for this, our preliminary study on the subject. Another limitation is that the method outlined in this paper can only be used to evaluate books for which online reviews have been created in relation to them. Some influential books, such as free e-books, with little or no reviews, cannot be evaluated and they can be widely distributed and cited without online reviews that can be evaluated. Furthermore, the method may not be suitable for measuring new books. Furthermore, the credibility of the reviews and the individual data source of our study may affect the generalizability of the results. Although data relating to \"helpfulness\" books are used for research."}, {"heading": "Future studies", "text": "For future studies, following the present work, we suggest a few interesting directions. First, scientific book reviews could be combined with social media book reviews to obtain more comprehensive evaluation results. Expert reviews are usually provided by professional scholars who primarily evaluate the content of the books and evaluate their academic values; for example, Dugan (2008) first commented on the content of each part of the book Management Basics for Information Professionals and then rated its pros and cons. Online reviews of Management Basics for Information Professionals by Amazon, 5 compared to Dugan (2008), not only reflect the content, but also evaluate the content of a book, but also focus on other aspects such as printing, packaging, etc. Online reviews of Management Basics for Information Professionals by Amazon, 5 compared to Dugan (2008), evaluate not only the content, but also the logistics, appearance, etc. In a further study, reviews of Google Basics for Information Professionals by Amazon, 5 compared to Dugan (2008), could evaluate the appearance of a book, etc. In 2015, scholars could collect reviews for social media sites such as Kousha Choice (2015) and Kusha social media site."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This study established a framework for measuring the impact of books against online reviews and their content. We evaluated how online reviews can be used for book reviews and found some positive results. In response to our first research question, online reviews appear to be valuable for assessing the impact of academic books. This suggests that, perhaps unsurprisingly, the content and translations of books are particularly important for improving the impact of academic books, while the choice of a superior operator (with good logistics and service offerings) is also important. Finally, in answering the third research question, there are clear differences between books published in different academic categories. In economics, management and LIS disciplines, significant positive correlations between book reviews and citations were found."}], "references": [{"title": "Citations to the \u201cIntroduction to informetrics\u201d indexed by WOS, Scopus and Google Scholar", "author": ["J.

Researchers have attempted to use other metrics, such as Google Books, libcitation, and publisher prestige. However, these approaches lack content-level information and cannot determine the citation intentions of users. Meanwhile, the abundant online review resources concerning academic books can be used to mine deeper information and content utilizing altmetric perspectives. In this study, we measure the impacts of academic books by multi-granularity mining online reviews, and we identify factors that affect a book\u2019s impact. First, online reviews of a sample of academic books on Amazon.cn are crawled and processed. Then, multi-granularity review mining is conducted to identify review sentiment polarities and aspects\u2019 sentiment values. Lastly, the numbers of positive reviews and negative reviews, aspect sentiment values, star values, and information regarding helpfulness are integrated via the entropy method, and lead to the calculation of the final book impact scores. The results of a correlation analysis of book impact scores obtained via our method versus traditional book citations show that, although there are substantial differences between subject areas, online book reviews tend to reflect the academic impact. Thus, we infer that online reviews represent a promising source for mining book impact within the altmetric perspective and at the multi-granularity content level. Moreover, our proposed method might also be a means by which to measure other books besides academic publications.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
