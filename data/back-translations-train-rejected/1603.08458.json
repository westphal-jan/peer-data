A variety of topics such as relationship and family issues later became popular in online peer discussions (Lewallen et al., 2014; Owen et al., 2004), but also disease-specific discussion topics such as treatment, diagnosis and interpretation of laboratory test results remain the most prevalent (Civan and Pratt, 2007; Meier et al., 2007a; Cappiello et al., 2007). Specific discussion topics were also identified. Meier and colleagues found, based on content analysis, that the most common topics in 10 cancer mailing lists were treatment information and communication options with health care providers (Meier et al., 2007a). Owen and colleagues proposed a 2004 theme scheme that included seven categories of disease treatment:"}, {"heading": "2 Methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Source of data and data processing", "text": "We relied on the discussion forum of the publicly available community of breastcancer.org. All the content of the discussion forum was collected in January 2015. The discussion forum is organized in separate forums, each with threads and posts. Preparatory steps were performed: for each post, metadata about the forum and the thread in which it was written, as well as author and date of creation, the content of each post was pre-edited by (i) removing all non-textual content (e.g. emoticon symbols were replaced by emoticon-related codes); and (ii) identifying sentence boundaries using the open source tool NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Creating the topic schema", "text": "In order to provide a reliable and useful commentary on topics, we have established a coding scheme of discussion topics through a literature review of information needs in online health communities focusing on breast cancer communities (Meier et al., 2007b; Civan et al., 2007; Blank et al., 2010; Skeels et al., 2010; Wen et al., 2011; Bender et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013). Our goals were (i) to develop a coding scheme that is relevant for describing the information needs of community members as well as being applicable and robust enough for automatic topic classification; and (ii) to develop a coding scheme that can be used to characterize discussion topics either for an entire post or its individual sentences. In addition, the annotation scheme is such that each unit of annotation can be labeled according to one or more topics."}, {"heading": "2.3 Manual Annotation", "text": "We selected a subset of entries (1008 entries consisting of 9016 sentences) from the original data set described above. The entries were selected from the various forums where each forum focused on specific aspects of breast cancer management, such as diagnosis and treatment options, support with chemotherapy, diet, alternative treatments, and daily life. Therefore, entries were grouped into groups of 50 entries per manual annotation session. To train for the comments, the coders practiced commenting the above 439 sentences (37 entries) using the annotation guidelines. For the comments, three coders were recruited, all of which were native English speakers with bachelor degrees. To train for the comments, the coders practiced commenting the above 439 sentences (37 entries) using the annotation guidelines. Intercommentator agreements with annotations with gold standard subject annotations were achieved during the training, with each coding statistician overlap of 0.6 having been achieved and one set of coding completed during the entire training (1)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Topic classification", "text": "Since a particular sentence can be described in a post according to several topics (e.g. a sentence on treatment, nutrition, and day-to-day issues can be at once), the task of automating the issue of coding can be presented as multi-label classification: For each sentence, there may be up to N labels, with N being the number of topics in the schema. This type of classification is more difficult than a single-label classification, where a sentence can be described by only one of the N topics selected in a schema. Traditionally, there are two approaches to multi-label, multi-class classification: problem transformation methods and algorithm adaptation methods (Tsoumakas and Katakis, 2007). In this paper, we rely on three different Supervised Classifiers, a labeled LDA Classfier (Ramage et al, 2003), an SVM (Suykens and Vandewalle, 1999), and a Convolutionary Neural Network Discriminative Network (Kim, we conduct a mainstream DA-2014, three)."}, {"heading": "2.5 Application to the entire community to support longitudinal analysis", "text": "We applied the top-rated classifier to all sentences in the entire uncommented dataset, and for each post we assigned subject names associated with more than 1 / 10 of the sentences in the post. Thus, based on the aggregated Level 1 topic names, we can identify which topics are most common in the community in general; 2) if there are differences in topics between members of different stages of cancer. In this study, we did not examine any factors other than the cancer stage, since the cancer stage is a specific profile information that can be accessed. Furthermore, equipped with topic names for each post in the dataset, we performed the following longitudinal analyses to take into account the time stamp. The primary objective of our analysis was to assess whether participation in the community had an impact on the topic under discussion. Therefore, we compared the distribution of the topics of contributions published in different periods of time in relation to the users \"registration date and tracked their changes."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Manual annotation", "text": "Table 2 shows distributions and sample sets for different topics in the manually annotated dataset. Treatment and Different Sentences are the most common topics in our annotated dataset, while alternative medicine and test topics are the least common. The high number of Different Sentences is explained by the fact that most entries begin with greetings and end with encouragement, blessings and signatures (all classified as Miscellaneous in our coding).Table 3 shows the agreement between the commentators for each pair of commentators across the three commentators. Among the three commentators, the first coder commented on all 1008 entries, while the other two supplementary coders were assigned a portion of the entire dataset."}, {"heading": "3.2 Topic classification", "text": "The classifiers were evaluated in a 5-fold cross-validation framework using precision, recall, and F measurement. To evaluate the overall performance of the system across all topics, microaverage precision, recall, and F. (Yang, 1999) The microaverage takes into account the distribution of labels, which is more meaningful in this study due to the imbalance of labels in the dataset. Experiments are also conducted with a baseline system that simply marks each set with all possible labels. Overall set classification results are listed in Table 4."}, {"heading": "3.3 General prevalence of topics", "text": "The least common topic is alternative medicine (ALTR, 0.2%) and testing (TEST, 1.0%). It is noteworthy that MISC did not appear in the level note, because it is a standard category that is only assigned if no other topics are identified in all sentences of the post. Therefore, its prevalence at the level is extremely low and is not of interest to our subsequent analyses. Clinically relevant topics such as treatment, diagnosis and findings are more prevalent in the Breast Cancer Forum than non-clinical topics, with the exception of PERS. Thematic distribution throughout the BC dataset is more distorted than those in the annotated dataset, as the submitted alternative datasets were rarer in terms of the ALS data collected."}, {"heading": "3.4 Topic prevalence stratified by cancer stage", "text": "In the BC dataset, many users show self-reported disease information in profiles, including cancer diagnoses and treatment histories. This profile information appears in signatures when the authors publish contributions that are available to the public. Specifically, 17,950 (31.3%) of the 57,424 authors in the dataset we trawled through have their cancer stage information available in signatures. Among them are 2,325 in Stage 0 (total number of contributions: 170,610), 5,968 in Stage I (total number of contributions: 600,500), 5,907 in Stage II (total number of contributions: 661,990), 2,447 in Stage III (total number of contributions: 229,955) and 2,438 in Stage IV (total number of contributions: 460,313). The thematic distribution of contributions published by members of different stages of cancer is given in Table 1. Statistical tests (multi-layered and consistent) were also conducted between the different stages."}, {"heading": "3.5 Topic trajectory of users", "text": "Figure 2 shows changes in the frequency of issues after members join the community, in weeks, days and individual posts. Several types of pathways are identified: firstly, diagnosis is the dominant issue in the early stages of participation, especially in the first posts and first days. Secondly, the frequency of some issues such as the personal (PERS), the everyday (DAIL) and nutrition (NUTR) is steadily increasing, while the prevalence of diagnosis (DIAG) and treatment (TREA) decreases the longer members remain in the community. Thirdly, the frequency of health systems (HSYS) and findings (FIND) increases at the outset but decreases after reaching peak levels. Finally, alternative medicine (ALTR), laboratory testing (TEST) and resources (RSRC) are unpopular issues in the overall participation of members."}, {"heading": "4 Discussions", "text": "In the Breast Cancer Community, a wide range of topics are discussed, ranging from clinically relevant topics such as diagnosis and treatment to more mundane topics such as dietary supplements and personal life. In the Breast Cancer Forum, personal issues and treatment are the most dominant topics and may represent a mix of emotional support and informative support that is shared. Stage of cancer also plays a role in deciding the discussion topics of members, many of whom are newcomers to the community, care more about diagnostic information. Level 0 members focus in particular on whether certain signs indicate cancer. They also share anecdotes about their experiences visiting health care providers when they are diagnosed. Level IV members usually stay longer in the community as their cancer develops. For these members, seeking information is no longer the primary motivation to participate; on the contrary, they establish closer relationships with their online counterparts and share more personal information and support each other. It is emotional to note, however, that the information extracted from the membership may be accurate."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we provide a multi-class scheme, annotated dataset, and monitored classifiers based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and other models for assigning topic classification to texts from online health communities. We apply the classifier to the most popular online breast cancer community, the breastcancer.org discussion forums, and conduct longitudinal analyses to identify topic distributions and topic changes during members \"participation. Our experimental results suggest that CNN outperforms other classifiers in assigning topic classification. We also found that while personal and disease-related topics are the most common, members of different cancer stages have different themes. Finally, during their participation, members change their interest and become increasingly interested in more personal topics in online discussions."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work is supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Grant R01GM114355."}], "references": [{"title": "MariaCarolina Jimenez-Marroquin", "author": ["Jacqueline L Bender"], "venue": "and Alejandro R Jadad.", "citeRegEx": "Bender et al.2011", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2011}, {"title": "Lorraine E Ferris", "author": ["Jacqueline L Bender", "Joel Katz"], "venue": "and Alejandro R Jadad.", "citeRegEx": "Bender et al.2013", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2013}, {"title": "Prasenjit Mitra", "author": ["Prakhar Biyani", "Cornelia Caragea"], "venue": "and John Yen.", "citeRegEx": "Biyani et al.2014", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2014}, {"title": "Anna Karina Monteiro", "author": ["Thomas O Blank", "Steven D Schmidt", "Stacey A Vangsness"], "venue": "and Paul V Santagata.", "citeRegEx": "Blank et al.2010", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2010}, {"title": "AY Ng", "author": ["DM Blei"], "venue": "and MI Jordan.", "citeRegEx": "Blei et al.2003", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2003}, {"title": "M Tish Knobf", "author": ["Michelle Cappiello", "Regina S Cunningham"], "venue": "and Diane Erdos.", "citeRegEx": "Cappiello et al.2007", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2007}, {"title": "LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines", "author": ["Chang", "Lin2011] Chih-Chung Chang", "Chih-Jen Lin"], "venue": "ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,", "citeRegEx": "Chang et al\\.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chang et al\\.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Threading together patient expertise", "author": ["Civan", "Pratt2007] Andrea Civan", "Wanda Pratt"], "venue": "In AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,", "citeRegEx": "Civan et al\\.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Civan et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "James W Pennebaker", "author": ["Kathryn P Davison"], "venue": "and Sally S Dickerson.", "citeRegEx": "Davison et al.2000", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2000}, {"title": "Patricia Driscoll", "author": ["N Elhadad", "S Zhang"], "venue": "and Samuel Brody.", "citeRegEx": "Elhadad et al.2014", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2014}, {"title": "Trond Grenager", "author": ["Jenny Rose Finkel"], "venue": "and Christopher Manning.", "citeRegEx": "Finkel et al.2005", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2005}, {"title": "Managing the personal side of health: how patient expertise differs from the expertise of clinicians", "author": ["Hartzler", "Pratt2011] Andrea Hartzler", "Wanda Pratt"], "venue": "Journal of Medical Internet Research,", "citeRegEx": "Hartzler et al\\.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Hartzler et al\\.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Parameter estimation for text analysis", "author": ["G Heinrich"], "venue": "Web: http://www. arbylon. net/publications/text-est", "citeRegEx": "Heinrich.,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Heinrich.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Fiona M McTavish", "author": ["Sojung Claire Kim", "Dhavan V Shah", "Kang Namkoong"], "venue": "and David H Gustafson.", "citeRegEx": "Kim et al.2013", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2013}, {"title": "Convolutional neural networks for sentence classification. arXiv preprint arXiv:1408.5882", "author": ["Yoon Kim"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Kim.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Kim.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Erin O\u2019Carroll Bantum", "author": ["Andrea C Lewallen", "Jason E Owen"], "venue": "and Annette L Stanton.", "citeRegEx": "Lewallen et al.2014", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2014}, {"title": "NLTK: The natural language toolkit.
