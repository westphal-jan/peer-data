(1994) use a maximum entropy model to solve the PP binding problem. Schwartz et al. (2003) propose an uncontrolled approach to solving the PP binding problem using multilingual data. They transform the data into high-level linguistic representations and make decisions on the reconnection. Intuition is similar to our work, but the approach is completely different. Brill and Resnik (1994) discuss a transformation-based rule derivation method for disambiguating the PP binding problem. It is a simple learning algorithm that derives a series of transformation rules from the training corpus, which are then used to solve the pattachment problem. Stetina and Nagao (1997) use the semantic dictionary to solve the problem of the ambiguity of PP binding problems."}, {"heading": "3 Our Approach", "text": "We propose a dual decomposition based on a projected sequential algorithm to address the problem of pattachment disambiguation. Dual decomposition, or more generally Lagrangian relaxation, is a classic method of projected edge optimization and has been applied to several sequence problems in NLP (Rush and Collins, 2012). We train two separate parser models for English and Hindi, using the MSTParser models for edge optimization each. Input to the algorithm is a parallel English-Hindi sentence pair, with its word alignments. We first get the predicted parser trees for the English and Hindi sentences from the respective trained parser models as an initiation step. The DD algorithm then tries to force an agreement between the two parse trees that match the given alignments.Let's take a closer look at what we mean by the parser trees."}, {"heading": "3.1 Dual Decomposition based Algorithm", "text": "The trees Te and Th are initialized by the previously trained parser models for the respective languages.

Let's remember that we have two nodes in a language with an edge between them, and we try to predict the path of the corresponding aligned nodes in the other language. The first classifier predicts the length of the projected path, and the second predicts the predicted path itself, since the path length of the first classifier must not be greater than 5. Consider these classifiers separately. The classifier for path length prediction is a set of five binary classifiers that predict the path length, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. We assume that the projected path lengths must not be greater than 5. These classifiers are perceptrons trained on separate commented data. The features used were the words and POS tags of the four nodes in the pair of alignments of the classifiers for the length of the classifiers, and the length of the classifiers for the classifiers is one of the four."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments and Results", "text": "A parser model was converted with the MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2006) from a portion of the Hindi dependency treebank data (18708 records) from the IIIT-Hyderabad (Bhatt et al., 2009), and a portion of the Penn treebank (28188 records) was used to train the classifiers, which was converted with the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We have been able to achieve an accuracy of 10% above the baseline with our approach. However, our system is not able to beat the MSTParser model in terms of analysing dependency as a whole and not just in terms of PP attachments. However, we need to test our approach on a larger data set and in areas other than tourism. Besides Hindi, there is also scope for exploring other languages as tools for pp attachments in English. Our approach could also be used for attachments with Wh clause. Since faulty attachments have a direct impact on machine translation, an interesting analysis could be using pp attachments from our system and checking the quality of the translation."}], "references": [{"title": "Improving Parsing and PP Attachment Performance with Sense Information", "author": ["Eneko Agirre", "Timothy Baldwin", "David Martinez."], "venue": "ACL. 317\u201332.
