Since preferences are ubiquitous in common sense reasoning, there has been a considerable effort to integrate the preference information within NMR formalisms (vhs). In order to evaluate different formalisms, different characteristics of non-monotonous arguments and actions of preference are proposed, see e.g. Makinson 1988; Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor 1990; Brewka and Eiter 1999; Brewka, Truszczyn\" ski \"ski\" ski \"ski\" ski \"ski\" ski \"ski\" ski \"ski\" ski \"ski\" ski \"ski\" ski \"ski.\" ski. \""}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "We refer to the following ABA background information (Toni 2014).Definition 1.

In particular, we first found that ABA +, assuming the principle of counterposition (see e.g. (Modgil und Prakken 2013), exhibits desirable properties similar to those of other existing argumentation formalisms, such as (Dung 1995). Then we showed that ABA + fulfils some (well) desirable principles of preferential treatment in reasoning and non-monotonous thinking, e.g. (Brewka and Eiter 1999). Finally, we analyzed non-monotonous consequential properties (as in (Cayras and Toni 2015)) of ABA + under various semantics. We believe that our work contributes to the understanding of preferences within reasoning in particular and in non-monotonous thinking overall."}], "references": [{"title": "and Cayrol", "author": ["L.
