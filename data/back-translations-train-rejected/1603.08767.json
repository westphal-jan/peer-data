In this context, we mention a recent book dealing with machine learning on a large scale [1] that includes presentations of generic frameworks for highly scalable ML implementations such as DryadLINQ or IBM PMLT, as well as specific implementations of ML techniques on these platforms, such as ensemble decision trees, SVM, k-Means, etc. It includes contributions from both industry leaders (Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft) and academics (Berkeley, NYU, University of California, etc.). Recent articles, such as those by S. Charrington [3], W. Eckerson [4] and D. Harris [5], review large ML solutions that use ML solutions to optimize most products, the retail website and telecommunications."}, {"heading": "3 Machine Learning environments from the cloud", "text": "Providers in this category offer computer clusters with public cloud providers, such as Amazon EC2, Rackspace, etc., pre-installed with statistics software, with preferred packages being R-System, Octave, or Mapple. These solutions provide their customers with scalable high-performance resources in the cloud that are freed from the burden of installing and managing their own clusters. Cloudnumbers.com 1 uses Amazon EC2 Providers to set up computer clusters that are pre-installed with scientific computing software, such as R-System, Octave, or Mapple. Customers benefit from a web interface where they can create their own workspaces, configure and monitor the cluster, upload records, or connect to public databases. On top of that, Cloud Provider's feature, Cloudnumbers provides high security standards by providing secure encryption for data transmission and storage. Overall, an HPC platform in the cloud is easy to create and manage."}, {"heading": "4 Plugins for Machine Learning toosl", "text": "In this class, statistical applications (e.g. R-System, Python) are augmented by plugins that allow users to create a Hadoop cluster in the cloud and perform time-consuming jobs on it over large datasets. Most of the interest has been R, for which several extensions are available, compared to Python, for which less effort was invested in supporting distributed processing until recently. In this section, we will have several solutions for R and Python.RHIPE 6 is an R package that implements a Map / reduce framework for accessing a Hadoop installation from the R environment. With specific R functions, users are able to start maps / reduce workstations running on the Hadoop cluster and the results will then be implemented from HDFS.Snow 7 [16] and its variants (Snowfall, snowFT) into a framework that is able to express an important class of parallel calculations and easily use them in an interactive environment such as R."}, {"heading": "5 Distributed Machine Learning libraries", "text": "In fact, it is the case that we will be able to find a solution that is capable, that we are able, that we are able to find a solution that we are able to find, that we are able, that we are able, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able, that we are able to find a solution."}, {"heading": "6 Complex Machine Learning systems", "text": "In this area, there are several business intelligence and data analytics solutions that share a number of common features: (i) all of them can be deployed on premise or in cloud clusters; (ii) the rich graphical tools for analyzing, researching, and visualizing large amounts of data; (iii) the relatively limited number of ML-DM functions; (iv) the prediction models and (iv) the integration of Apache hadrys and storage environments; and there are differences in the way data is integrated and processed based on system complexity: Kitenga Analytics 20, recently purchased by Dell, is a native Hadoop application that provides visual search for visual solutions; Apache Solutions 21-based search; natural language processing; Apache Mahout-based data processing; and advanced visualizations."}, {"heading": "7 Software as a Service providers for Machine Learning", "text": "This section is based on platform-as-a-service, or software-as-a-service providers for machine learning. They provide the services mainly through RESTful interfaces, and in some (rare) cases, the solution can also be installed locally (Myrrix), as opposed to solutions from the previous section, which are mainly deployable systems on private data centers. As a class of ML problems, predictive modeling is the preferred target (BigML, Google Prediction API, own dog) among these systems. In this study, we did not include SQL vendors via Hadoop solutions (e.g. Cloudera Impala, Hadapt, Hive) because their main goal is not ML-DM, but fast, elastic, and scalable SQL processing of relational data using Hadoop.BigML 29 \"s distributed architecture is a SaaS approach to machine learning. Users can set up data resources, visualize, and model decisions."}, {"heading": "7.1 Text mining as SaaS", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to go in search of a solution worthy of their name, most of them are able to go in search of a solution that they have got a grip on, most of them are able to go in search of a solution, most of them are able to go in search of a solution, most of them are able to go in search of a solution, most of them are able to go in search of a solution, most of them are able to go in search of a solution, most of them are able to go in search of a solution, most of them are able to go in search of a solution, most of them are able to find a solution for themselves."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions and future work", "text": "Our key findings are summarized below: (1) Existing programming paradigms expressing large-scale parallelism, such as MapReduce (MR) and the Message Passing Interface (MPI), are de facto choices for implementing ML-DM algorithms. Due to their ability to process large data sets and provide built-in resilience, MR has received increasing attention. (2) Machine learning in distributed environments has different approaches and offers viable and cost-effective alternatives to traditional ML and statistical applications that do not focus on distributed environments [14]. (3) Existing solutions target either experienced, qualified computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticians or inexperienced users who are not satisfied with (or few) opportunities to adapt the algorithms. Ens user support and guidance are largely absent from existing distributed ML-DM solutions. After reviewing offers on different telecommunications platforms, we think that there is still room for M2 / D2 solutions in the market."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the EU FP7 project FP7REGPOT-2011-1 284595 (HOST)."}], "references": [{"title": "M", "author": ["R.

A second line of products is augmenting existing tools with plugins that allow users to create a Hadoop cluster in the cloud and run jobs on it. Next on the list are libraries of distributed implementations for ML algorithms, and on-premise deployments of complex systems for data analytics and data mining.
