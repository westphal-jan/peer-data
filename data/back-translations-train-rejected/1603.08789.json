Our idea is that, even when arguments and attacks are defined by means of a logical belief base, there may be some uncertainty about how accurate is the content of an argument, and so the presence (or absence) of attacks concerning it. We use enthymemes to illustrate this notion of uncertainty of arguments and attacks. Indeed, as argued in the literature, real arguments are often enthymemes instead of completely specified deductive arguments. This means that some parts of the pair (support, claim) may be missing because they are supposed to belong to some \"common knowledge\", and then should be deduced by the agent which receives the enthymeme. But the perception that agents have of the common knowledge may be wrong, and then a first agent may state an enthymeme that her opponent is not able to decode in an accurate way. It is likely that the decoding of the enthymeme by the agent leads to mistaken attacks between this new argument and the existing ones. In this case, the agent can receive some information about attacks or arguments acceptance statuses which disagree with her argumentation framework. We exemplify a way to incorporate this new piece of information by means of existing works on the dynamics of abstract argumentation frameworks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 14:29:00 GMT  (24kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08789v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jean-guy mailly"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08789"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.08789.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Using Enthymemes to Fill the Gap between Logical Argumentation and Revision of Abstract Argumentation Frameworks", "authors": ["Jean-Guy Mailly"], "emails": ["jmailly@dbai.tuwien.ac.at"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In fact, the reasoning can also be useful in a mono-agent setting, for example, to draw non-trivial conclusions from an inconsistent knowledge base (Besnard and Hunter 2001).The domain called Dynamics of reasoning has become a hot topic in recent years, with numerous publications about it.

One of the most influential works on this subject is the AGM framework (Alchourro) (Alchourro) n, Ga \ufffd rdenfors and Makinson 1985), which postulates rationality when beliefs are presented as deductively closed sets of formulas.

(b) Our informed sources say that the Wikileaks documents are fake (source: NY Times). (a) The media cannot rely on military issues (source: N. Chomsky).

Thus, for example, the development of efficient approaches to solving abstract argumentation problems allows the completion of the agent's AF with respect to several semantics and conclusions (see, for example, the argumentation solver contest (Thimm and Villata 2015). However, in order to avoid the loss of information about the nature of arguments and attacks, we propose to refine the definition of AF. Definition 12. Given D and E, which each denote the deductive arguments and enthyems of the agent, the enthyme-based AF F (D, E) = < A, R > with \u2022 A = D-E; \u2022 R = RD-RE-D \u00b7 D is the set of certain attacks (between deductive arguments); \u2022 RE (A \u00d7 A)\\ (D \u00d7 D) is the set of questionable attacks (at least one exempor)."}, {"heading": "Applying Dynamics of Abstract AFs to Enthymeme-based AFs", "text": "The existence of irritating attacks in an enthymeme-based AF can be addressed by some approaches to the dynamics of abstract reasoning (Bisquert et al. 2013; Doutre, Herzig and Perrussel 2014; Coste-Marquis et al. 2014a; Coste-Marquis et al. 2014b; Coste-Marquis et al. 2015) If some arguments and the relationships between them are secure (especially if they are fully specified arguments instead of enthymes), integrity constraints can easily be added to these revisions / updates / enforcement operations to ensure that prohibited attacks are not added and mandatory attacks are not removed.

Definition 14. Let F be the amount of AFs gained from the revision process. Example 5 Continued.

In fact, even if we consider an enthymeme e, some of them are fixed. If the reason for an attack between e and a deductive argument is a logical conflict involving one of these fixed parts of e, then that attack can be considered safe. Likewise, if we consider another enthymeme e-based attack, if there is an attack between e and e originating from the fixed part of e and the fixed part of e, that attack cannot be removed."}, {"heading": "Back to Chomsky Example", "text": "To conclude, let's formalize the intuitive \"Chomsky example,\" which shows the various completions of revelations leading to the various Agent AFs. We use the following statement variables: Withdrawal means that the US Army will withdraw; wkrmeans that the Wikileaks information about retreat is true; wkf means that the Wikileaks documents are fake; mnt means that media cannot be trusted on military issues.

There are various possible reasons, including technical and strategic reasons, which seem to be the most intuitive explanations. Also, implicit information is often used in the reasoning of natural language (for example, in social networks). When this situation occurs, there is a certain uncertainty in the resulting reasoning frameworks built up by the agents. It is likely that the opinion of the agents about the meaning and relationships between the arguments is different; there may be misunderstandings in the communication process, which lead to errors in the generation of arguments and attacks."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work is supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) under the funding programmes P25521 and I1102."}], "references": [{"title": "C", "author": ["Alchourr\u00f3n"], "venue": "E.; G\u00e4rdenfors, P.; and Makinson, D.", "citeRegEx": "Alchourr\u00f3n.
