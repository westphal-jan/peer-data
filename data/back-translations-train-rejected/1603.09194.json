A challenging aspect is the preservation of the consistency of the ontology and the receiver, which is here considered inconsistency, is the type of inconsistency of inter-ontological ambiguity: the sender and receiver can use the same symbol with different meanings (compare, for example, the different uses of the article below).Thus, the conflict resolution strategy exploited by the reinterpretation operators is based on disbiguity."}, {"heading": "4 Postulates for Iterated Reinterpretation", "text": "Many forms of ontological change (Flouris et al. 2008), especially ontology evolution (Kharlamov, Zheleznyakov and Calvanese 2013), require the iterated application of a new approach to information. In iterated faith, this problem is systematically addressed by defining the AGM postulates and operators for iterated applications of revision operators.The first systematic study on iterated faith dates back to the work of Darwiche and Pearl in 1994, which emphasizes the fact that the AGM postulates (Alchourro) n, Ga \u00bc rdenfors and Makinson are silent in 1985. The only postulates that can be said to affect the revision of triggers (supplement to postulates 7 and 8)."}, {"heading": "O\u03c3 \u2286 O \u25e6 SEQ", "text": "An operator that meets all triggering ontologies in the SEQ sequence (reconstruction) must guarantee the presence of a substitution \u03c1, so that the original ontology O and the set (SEQ) of all triggering ontologies are contained in a renamed variant of the revision result (O-SEQ) \u03c1. (reconstruction) There is a substitution \u03c1 s.t.: O-set (SEQ) (O-SEQ).All reinterpretation operators of this paper meet both postulates. I present this proposal, the proof of which is a slight adjustment of the evidence given in (Eschenbach and O-zc-ep 2010) for triggering concept-based technical literature. Proposition 4 Let O = (O, V, V \u2032) be an ontology and SEQ be a finite sequence of ontology axioms via V and a reinterpretation operator for triggering ontologies. Then there is a single operator, so that SEO-1."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "The reinterpretation operators are constructed in a similar way to those of Delgrande and Schaub (Delgrande and Schaub 2003), but differ in that they are defined not only for the statement logic, but also for DLs (and FOLs). Furthermore, I consider other stronger forms of bridging axioms than the implications of (Delgrande and Schaub 2003).Bridging axioms are special mappings that are used in the reinterpretation of the operator as tools for implementing the ontology revision. However, one can also consider mappings themselves as objects of revision (Qi, Ji and Haase 2009; Meilicke and Stuckenschmidt 2009); a particularly interesting case of the mapping revision comes into play with mappings used in the ontology-based data access paradigm (Calvanese et al. 2009). These mappings are intended to elevate data from the relational Ds to the ontology level."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In the paper, iterative applications of reinterpretation operators were discussed, which served to handle conflicts due to the ambiguous use of symbols in related and well-developed ontologies. Re-interpretation operators can also be used to resolve consistencies, not due to ambiguity, but due to incorrect information - and in fact, the related revision operators in (Delgrande and Schaub 2003) do not speak of ambiguity. But reinterpretation operators cannot be used to resolve inconsistencies that clearly cannot be explained by ambiguity: namely consistencies due to differing limitations of the sender and the recipient with respect to the number of possible objects in the domain (this was referred to as reinterpretation compatibility in (O \ufffd zc \ufffd ep 2008)). The reinterpretation for triggering words proved to be fulfilled (adapted versions of) classical iteration operations as a guarantee for the reconstruction of symbols used in the 1994 reconstruction and Pearl reconstruction."}, {"heading": "Appendix: Proofs", "text": "For the proof we need the following term 1 for all X2 B (\u03c3V) (ODP) (ODP) (ODP) (ODP) (ODP) (ODP) (ODP) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) V) (O) (O) V) (O) (O) V) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O) V) (O) V) (O) (O) (O) (O) (O)."}], "references": [{"title": "Updating RDFS aboxes and tboxes in SPARQL", "author": ["Calvanese Ahmeti", "A.
