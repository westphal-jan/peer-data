Typically, the focus is on new information that is given as a statement formula. In this paper, we deal with situations where an agent has to revise through a condition where the existing information is almost certainly false. Specifically, we look at processes that cannot be believed in the face of a finite amount of \"regular\" evidence. We represent the degree of belief in such formulas using oral conditional functions that can take on infinite values, and we offer an approach to conditional revision based on basic ordinary arithmetic. This paper makes several contributions to existing work on change of faith. First, we show that a simple algebra of change of faith in the finite case naturally extends to the finite case, which is a form of faith improvement, showing that there are natural examples in common sense where multiple levels of infinite imputability are actually useful."}, {"heading": "Motivating Example", "text": "Consider the following assertions: 1. serious: your dog is overweight; 2. flying: your dog can fly; 3. hollow | fly: if your dog can fly, it has hollow bones. 1This essay contains results published in (Hun15) and (Dog16).The first two assertions are simple declarative statements. However, note that there is a clear difference in the amount of evidence required to convince the agent to believe any assertion. (1) it is likely that a limited number of reports from a trusted source are required; (2) it seems unlikely that a limited number of reports would be convincing; this assertion is almost certainly false, although it is possible to imagine a situation that would convince an agent to believe it; and the third assertion is a condition with a highly improbable history.

We assume an underlying doctrinal signature P. An interpretation of P is called a state, while a logically closed doctrine of formulas about P is called a faith correction. A faith correction operator is a function that combines the original doctrine with a formula to create a new doctrine. Formal approaches to faith correction typically require some form of order or ranking that reflects the relative plausibility of possible states. For example, in the well-known AGM approach, total pre-orders about states are used to reflect the perceived probability of each state (AGM85; KM92). Unfortunately, this approach does not address the problem of repeated faith correction. Related work has dealt with repeated corrections by specifying explicitly J07, not explicitly changing doctrines like BM06, and DM92 only."}, {"heading": "Ordinal Conditional Functions", "text": "An ordinal conditional function (OCF) is a function that assigns each state to an ordinal number (Spo88; Wil94). In this approach, the strength of faith is captured by ordinal primacy. So, if r is an OCF and r (s) < r (t) is then s a more plausible state than t. There is an obvious advantage of this approach that a ranking function is clearly more meaningful than a total primacy order. While the original definition allows the range of an OCF as a class of all ordinals, it is customary to limit the range to the natural numbers, possibly with an additional symbol representing impossibility. In this paper, we will actually use a slightly larger range; therefore, we must briefly review the ordinal arithmetics.2 For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that ordinals are actually defined by an \"order type.\" The finite ordinals are the natural numbers."}, {"heading": "Belief Change as Ordinal Arithmetic", "text": "Although our goal is to deal with conditional revision, we first introduce a simple approach to faith change based on the addition of ordinals, which will allow us to precisely define the concept of an almost counterfactual statement, which is 2 It is outside the scope of this essay to give a complete treatment of infinite ordinals and ordinals arithmetic. In the discussion here, we will skip the basic set theory and the fact that order types are defined in the sense of set containment.

Definition 2 Let r1 and r2 appear as \u03c9-CFs above S, and let m be the minimum value of r1 + r2. Then the function on S is defined as follows: r1 + protection r2 (x) = r1 (x) + r2 (x) \u2212 m.It is easy to verify that this operation is associative, commutative, and that each element is invertible in the sense that there is an r for each r, so that r2 (x) = 0 (x) \u2212 m.Therefore, in relation to algebra, we say that the class of \u03c9-CFs is an Abelian group, commutative, and that each element is invertible, in the sense that for each group there is a \u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441r, we say that the \u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441r is a problem, we say that the \u0442\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441r is a \u0442\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441r = a \u0442\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441r."}, {"heading": "Finite Zeroing", "text": "We define an algebra over a ranking of 2 r, let us introduce a minimum of value-added categories that sees itself able to abide by the rules.

Example: We return, for example, to the flying dog. Let's suppose that at first we think \u00ac fly and \u00ac hollow; in other words, we believe that dogs do not fly and that dogs do not have hollow bones. Now, let's suppose that we are told that flying dogs have hollow bones. Informal, we want to revise the conditional statement (hollow | fly). Note that (hollow | fly) does not in fact give any new information about dogs. This revision should not change the relative order of worlds with a finite strength of faith. However, it does lead to a change of belief. If one is later convinced of the existence of flying dogs, then the fact about hollow bones should be included. We refer to the reasoning in the previous example as an almost counterfactual revision."}, {"heading": "Levels of Implausibility", "text": "Approaches to counterfactual reasoning are usually inspired to some extent by Lewis, who points out that the truth of a counterfactual proposition is determined by its truth in alternative worlds (Lew73). We can only represent this idea in relation to each of these unlikely worlds if we essentially have an entirely new order of plausibility, because we admit the possibility that it can ultimately be credible. The important quality we can grasp with the constants 2-CFs is this: There are some formulas that can be true, but we cannot be persuaded to believe them on the basis of any finite number of \"weak proofs.\" This allows us to give the following formal definition of the term almost counterfactual."}, {"heading": "Relation to Existing Work", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Infinite Plausibility Values", "text": "There are situations where a single observation is not sufficient to believe a certain fact.Improvement Operators (K) the AGM framework is clearly wrong in cases where evidence is additive.

We have shown that distributing plausibility values across \u03c92 leads to a slightly more complicated faith algebra, and we gain an expressive advantage. In particular, we can depict situations where persistent beliefs are resistant to contrary evidence. We have shown that this leads to a slightly more expressive class of improvement operators in which evidence increases relative faith, but no finite number of improvements actually leads to a change in the state of faith. Finally, we have looked at the so-called \"near-counterfactual\" revision, in which we include information that depends on a highly improbable statement."}, {"heading": "Future Work", "text": "This paper is a preliminary exploration of various applications and formal properties of infinitely valuable conditional functions. Thus, it remains to go beyond \u03c92-CFs, to fully characterize the relationship with corrective surgeons, and to consider further practical applications.In the current context, we have discussed almost counterfactual considerations as a tool to preserve a kind of \"memory\" of improbable situations in order to include this information later, if necessary. However, there is also a natural kind of reasoning that would allow us to argue by analogy about the actual state of the world. Consider the following well-known ambiguity (Lew73), originally attributed to Quine: 1. If Caesar were president, he would use nuclear weapons. 2. If Caesar were president, he would use catapults.As a condition, we could write both as (W | C), where W stands for a weapon that would be used, and C for the condition \"Caesar is president\" (1) that we would actually be a catapult."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change: Partial meet functions for contraction and revision", "author": ["C.E.
