In this paper we study belief revision when the underlying logic is non-monotonic instead--an inherently interesting problem that is under explored. In particular, we will focus on the revision of a body of beliefs that is represented as a logic program under the answer set semantics, while the new information is also similarly represented as a logic program. Our approach is driven by the observation that unlike in a monotonic setting where, when necessary, consistency in a revised body of beliefs is maintained by jettisoning some old beliefs, in a non-monotonic setting consistency can be restored by adding new beliefs as well. We will define a syntactic revision function and subsequently provide representation theorem for characterising it.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 06:27:16 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09465v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["zhiqiang zhuang", "james delgrande", "abhaya nayak", "abdul sattar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09465"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.09465.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A New Approach for Revising Logic Programs", "authors": ["Zhiqiang Zhuang", "James Delgrande", "Abhaya Nayak", "Abdul Sattar"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 3.09 465v 1 [cs.A I] 3 1M ar2 01"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to keep to the rules which they have imposed on themselves.

It takes a logic program P, called the original logic program, and a logic program Q, called the revision program, and returns another logic program P \u0445 Q, the revised logic program. Following the revision of the AGM, we would like Q to be included in P \u0445 Q (i.e., Q'P \u00b2 Q), P \u0445 Q to be consistent whenever possible, and that as much of P as is consistent possible in P \u0432 Q.Obviously, a key problem in defining what we want to deal with is the possible inconsistency between Q and P. As illustrated in the textbook, one way to ensure that P \u00b2 Q is consistent is to remove a minimum set of beliefs from P, so that adding Q to the result is consistent. Of course, there is more than one way to remove beliefs from P."}, {"heading": "P \u2191 Q iff", "text": "1. P-R-Q compatible programs are consistent, and 3. P-R-Q-Q is consistent, then R-Q-Q is consistent, then R-Q-Q = consistent, then R-Q-Q is incompatible, then R-Q-Q is consistent and includes a minimal change made to P-P to achieve consistency. These programs should clearly be candidates for designing the revised logic program P-Q, but they do not form the group of all candidates. In particular, we can get a program that is least different from P and consistent with Q by removing some beliefs from P and adding some new beliefs to P-P. This is how we look at all of these logic programs that are least different from P and consistent with Q; these are referred to as s-compatible programs by P-Q.Definition 4.

Significantly, they bring the SE model into the picture. They do not work with response theorems as the basis for revisions, but base their definitions directly on SE models. The work has inspired several other SE model approaches. Schwind and Inoue (2013) provide a constructive characterization for the revision operators in (Delgrande et al. 2013b). Delgrande et al (2013a) adapt the model-based revision of Katsuno and Mendelzon models and offer a constructive characterization for the revision operators in (Delgrande et al. 2013b).

Traditional faith revision assumes that an actor argues monotonously; therefore, by definition, it is applicable only to such situations. In this context, we have set ourselves the goal of creating a framework for faith revisions for situations where the actor argues non-monotonously. To this end, we have defined a faith revision function for disjunctive logic programs that is semantic within the framework of the response set. Inconsistency resolution is an essential task for faith revisions, but are limited to situations where the actor argues monotonously."}, {"heading": "Appendix: Proof of Results", "text": "In this annex we give the proof of the most important results."}, {"heading": "Proof for Proposition 2", "text": "Let P and Q be logical programs. Suppose P-Q is inconsistent. We must show P \u2191 Q = \u2205. Since P-Q is m-inconsistent, we have SE (P) and SE (Q) = \u2205. According to the definition of s-expansion-compatible program, each element in P \u2191 Q must be a superset of P and be consistent with Q. However, for each superset we have R of P SE (P). Thus, SE (R) and SE (Q) = \u2205, which implies R-Q, is m-inconsistent."}, {"heading": "Proof for Theorem 1", "text": "P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P"}, {"heading": "P \\ (P \u2217 Q) = P \\ (P \u2217 R) and (P \u2217 Q) \\ (P \u222a Q) =", "text": "P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P"}, {"heading": "455\u2013462, 1988.", "text": "[Schwind and Inoue 2013] Nicolas Schwind and Katsumi Inoue.
