In domains like clothing recommendation, this task is particularly challenging since a successful system should be capable of handling a large corpus of items, a huge amount of relationships among them, as well as the high-dimensional and semantically complicated features involved. Furthermore, the human notion of \"compatibility\" that we need to capture goes beyond mere similarity: For two items to be compatible---whether jeans and a t-shirt, or a laptop and a charger---they should be similar in some ways, but systematically different in others.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 07:22:30 GMT  (4709kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09473v1", "10 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 07:25:36 GMT  (4734kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09473v2", "11 pages, 5 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 00:43:21 GMT  (4734kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09473v3", "11 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["ruining he", "charles packer", "julian mcauley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09473"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.09473.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Compatibility Across Categories for Heterogeneous Item Recommendation", "authors": ["Ruining He", "Charles Packer", "Julian McAuley"], "emails": ["jmcauley}@cs.ucsd.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is the case that you are in a position to go to another world, in which you can go to another world, in which you have to go to another world, in which you have to go to another world, in which you can go to another world, in which you can go to another world, in which you go to another world, in which you go to another world, in which you go to another world, in which you feel transported back to another world."}, {"heading": "II.

Such methods can be based on collaborative filtering, e.g. counting the overlap between items that both items have clicked on, as in Amazon's own solution [18]. Latent-factor approaches aim to model user-item relationships by showing the overlap between items."}, {"heading": "III. THE MODEL", "text": "Formally, we are assigned a data set D that includes a large corpus of objects (or \"items\") and the paired relationships R between items from different subcategories, i.e. if (x, y) and (1) items x and y are related to each other and (2) x and y do not come from the same subcategory (e.g. a shirt and matching pants).We select such cross-category recommendations to emphasize our model's ability to generate recommendations between heterogeneous items, which corresponds to the training instance's selective approach [31]. In addition, a high-dimensional feature vector fx is provided that is associated with each item x (e.g. encodes its image or the text of its ratings).We seek a scalable method to model such relationships with a set of parameterized transformation functions d (x, y) in such a way that related objects (x), y (x) and y (x) probabilities are assigned."}, {"heading": "A.

To this end, we use a method from [24] that randomly wires the positive set in such a way that (1) the item sequence of the items is preserved and (2) each negative pair of items consists of two categories. Afterwards, we proceed with adjusting the parameters by maximizing the log probability of the training corpus: This procedure can be designed so that the maximum item sequence of the items is preserved and (2) each negative pair of items consists of two categories."}, {"heading": "IV.

Comparison Methods", "text": "Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN): This method uses a weighted Euclidean distance in the raw attribute space to measure the similarity between items: dw (x, y) = \u0442 w (fx \u2212 fy) \u0442 22. Here is the Hadamard product and w is a weighting vector learned from the data. Category Tree (CT): This method calculates a matrix of coexistence between the subcategories from the training data. Then a pair (x, y) is predicted to be positive if subcategory y is one of the 50% most frequently associated subcategories of subcategory x.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we introduced Monomer, a method for modeling heterogeneous relationships for item-to-item recommendation tasks. We found that existing methods for item-to-item recommendations suffer from a few limitations in dealing with heterogeneous data, mainly due to their dependence on metricity or \"nearest neighbor\" type assumptions. To overcome these limitations, our method used \"blends\" of non-metric embeddings that allow us to loosen the identity and symmetry assumptions of existing metric methods. The proposed scalable approach generates diverse and cross-category recommendations that capture more complex relationships than mere visual similarity. We demonstrated quantitatively that monomer is accurate in linking tasks using common purchase and co-browsing dyads from Amazon, and qualitatively that it is capable of generating diverse recommendations that are consistent with a particular visual style."}], "references": [{"title": "Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions", "author": ["G.

"abstractText": "Identifying relationships between items is a key task of an online recommender system, in order to help users discover items that are functionally complementary or visually compatible. In domains like clothing recommendation, this task is particularly challenging since a successful system should be capable of handling a large corpus of items, a huge amount of relationships among them, as well as the high-dimensional and semantically complicated features involved. Furthermore, the human notion of \u201ccompatibility\u201d to capture goes beyond mere similarity: For two items to be compatible\u2014whether jeans and a t-shirt, or a laptop and a charger\u2014they should be similar in some ways, but systematically different in others. In this paper we propose a novel method, Monomer, to learn complicated and heterogeneous relationships between items in product recommendation settings. Recently, scalable methods have been developed that address this task by learning similarity metrics on top of the content of the products involved. Here our method relaxes the metricity assumption inherent in previous work and models multiple localized notions of \u2018relatedness,\u2019 so as to uncover ways in which related items should be systematically similar, and systematically different. Quantitatively, we show that our system achieves state-ofthe-art performance on large-scale compatibility prediction tasks, especially in cases where there is substantial heterogeneity between related items. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that richer notions of compatibility can be learned that go beyond similarity, and that our model can make effective recommendations of heterogeneous content.
