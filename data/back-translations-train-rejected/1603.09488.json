We are particularly interested in the following formalities for the representation of knowledge: 1. predicate logic of the first order; 2. deductive (production) systems. In such a system there are a number of starting objects, follow-up rules for the construction of new objects from initial or already built objects and the totality of initial and constructed objects. 3. semantic network. In the most general case, a semantic network is an entity-relationship model, i.e. a graph whose vertices correspond with objects (conceptions) of theory and edges."}, {"heading": "2 Description of the Project", "text": "In this context, it has to be said that this is a process, in which it is a matter of establishing a process, in which it is a matter of starting a process in which the various actors identify with each other in a certain way."}, {"heading": "3 Deductive (Production) Systems", "text": "In fact, most people are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "6 Software Description", "text": "The MathSem program itself is written by Vitaly Tatarintsev. Currently only the syntax is implemented, the work on semantics is in progress. Only parent-son relations take place. In this program, complicated formulas are created \"manually\" from atomic formulas. The created formulas can be stored together with their descriptions in a Word file. It is also possible to upload formulas from a Word file. Below is an example of the construction of about 30 formulas. It is noteworthy that the entire signature of set theory is built from formulas with a length (number of atomic formulas) of no more than two."}, {"heading": "N \u0424\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0443\u043b\u0430 / Formula \u041e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435/", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7 Table with result formulae.", "text": "Starting from the predicate of membership, we have achieved inclusion, intersection, unification, complement, relative complement, Cartesian set product, partial set relationship, powerset. < Set; < Set; We have built the entire set theory signature in a combinatorial way from the member predicate.
