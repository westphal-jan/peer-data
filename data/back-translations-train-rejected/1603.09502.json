Hereby, the knowledge is represented by so-called argumentation frameworks (AFs) and the reasoning is done via semantics extracting acceptable sets. All reasonable semantics are based on the notion of conflict-freeness which means that arguments are only jointly acceptable when they are not linked within the AF. In this paper, we study the question which information on top of conflict-free sets is needed to compute extensions of a semantics at hand. We introduce a hierarchy of so-called verification classes specifying the required amount of information. We show that well-known standard semantics are exactly verifiable through a certain such class. Our framework also gives a means to study semantics lying inbetween known semantics, thus contributing to a more abstract understanding of the different features argumentation semantics offer.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 09:29:02 GMT  (102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09502v1", "Contribution to the 16h International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, 2016, Cape Town"]], "COMMENTS": "Contribution to the 16h International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, 2016, Cape Town", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ringo baumann", "thomas linsbichler", "stefan woltran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09502"}, "pdf": {"name": "1603.09502.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Verifiability of Argumentation Semantics\u2217", "authors": ["Ringo Baumann", "Thomas Linsbichler", "Stefan Woltran"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In the late 1980s, the idea of using argumentation labels was an acceptable reasoning that did not argue monotonously (see Loui 1987; Pollock 1987) and (Prakken and Vreeswijk 2002) for an excellent overview theory. Today's common argumentation theory is a vibrating subfield of artificial intelligence that requires aspects of knowledge representation, multi-agent systems, and also philosophical questions. (Dung 1995) plays an important role in this field of research. At the heart of Dung's approach lie the so-called argumentation classes of argumentation theory (cf.) for an excellent overview.
