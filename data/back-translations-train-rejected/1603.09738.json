It has been used in business and health sectors to predict the effect of a specific action on a given individual. Despite its advantages, uplift models show high sensitivity to noise and disturbance, which leads to unreliable results. In this paper we show different approaches to address the problem of uplift modeling, we demonstrate how disturbance in data can affect uplift measurement. We propose a new approach, we call it Pessimistic Uplift Modeling, that minimizes disturbance effects. We compared our approach with the existing uplift methods, on simulated and real data-sets.

RELATED WORK", "text": "Usually, two random samples are used that are required for the collection of models. A sample called treatment sample, they get one action, another monitored sample called control sample, they do not get the action, then an uplift score would be measured by calculating the difference between the predicted probabilities of each model. A model would be built on the basis of treatment methods that apply this method in the marketing field, in particular to increase the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. An intuitive way of collecting models would follow, a model would be built on the basis of treatment methods, the second use of control samples, then we get predicted uplift of two predicted probabilities. Uplift = P (R | T) \u2212 P (R, x) uplift models are the goal of classifying individuals in four quarters (see Figure 1).We can use uplift techniques in direct and indirect methods."}, {"heading": "3.

EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We followed the steps of Leo Guelman (CR / C), who used a modified version of Tian et. al experiment framework [21]. We evaluated our method within eight different scenarios, scenarios and scenarios, which differ by the factor of strength of the main treatment effects over heterogeneity, the correlations between characteristics and the magnitude of noise in the simulated data. We used simulation data for the evaluation, which has given us the advantage of comparing the uplift model score with the real personal uplift, this advantage that cannot be found in real data. We name the correlation between the real and predicted models, the correlation between the real and predicted uplift models. We used simulation data developed by Guelman in order to produce the simulated data, we have the same method for the Conditional with the Conditional Method (the method we applied to the Conditional with the Conditions)."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "Uplift modeling is a technique for predicting the impact of a particular action on individual behavior. There are many approaches to creating uplift models, most of which have difficulty achieving reliable values in loud datasets. Most real datasets contain noise and interference, especially for uplift modeling, as uplift effects tend to be smaller than the real treatment effect. This leads us to introduce our approach, which is based on building a stabilizer model that would help avoid noise-based outcomes. We have compared our approach to other uplift methods by using simulated and real datasets. To measure models, we used real uplift curves, effectiveness and precision. Our model shows more stable and effective models than other approaches."}, {"heading": "6. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] F. Alemi, H. Erdman, I. Griva, and C. H. Evans.J.
