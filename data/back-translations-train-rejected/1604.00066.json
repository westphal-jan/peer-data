Therefore, we are following the pioneering work on this topic [5] and using a simulator to set up and predict the physical results of wooden block towers. Then, we describe the method we are investigating for visual stability forecasting. We use state-of-the-art deep learning techniques that are de facto standard in today's recognition systems. Finally, we describe the structure of the human study that we are conducting to supplement machine predictions with a human reference."}, {"heading": "3.1 Synthetic Data", "text": "Based on the scene simulation framework used in [13,5], we create only a single image block in our experimental phase with rectangular block blocks as basic elements. The number of blocks, block size, stack depth and stack depth vary in different scenes, which we will purposely refer to as scene parameters. Block Numbers We expect that different sizes of towers and blocks involved will affect the difficulty and challenge of stability of a tower in man and machine. While obviously the appearance becomes more complex, the number of contact surfaces and interactions makes the problem equally richer. Therefore, we include scenes with four different numbers of blocks, 4 blocks, 6 blocks and 14 blocks as {4B, 10B}.Stacking Depth As we focus our investigations on assessing the stability of monocular inputs, we vary the depth of the tower from a layer that we call multi-layer setting that we call 3D."}, {"heading": "3.2 Stability Prediction from Still Images", "text": "Inspiration from human research in [13,5] suggests that the combinations of the most prominent features in the scenes are not sufficient to capture people's judgments, but the contemporary study shows that human perception of visual information, especially some geometric features, such as the critical angle [6,7], plays an important role in this process. Regardless of the actual inner mechanism for humans to analyze visual input, it is clear that there is a mapping f that incorporates visual inputs I into the stability forecast P. f. In our work, we are interested in mapping f exclusively for visual inputs and say it along with other aspects, such as physical limitations for judgement or exclusive, as in [6] using visual cues alone for decision making. Image Classifier for Stability Prediction In our work, we are interested in mapping f exclusively for visual inputs and directly for physical stability."}, {"heading": "3.3 Human Subject Study", "text": "We recruit human subjects to predict stability for scenic scenarios. Due to the large amount of test data, images from different scenic groups are randomly selected for the test. 8 subjects are recruited for the test. Each subject receives a series of recorded images from the test. Each set contains 96 images covering all 16 scenic groups with 6 scenic instances per group. For each scenic scene, an assessment of stability on a scale from 1 to 5 will be required without limitation for the reaction time: 1. Definitely unstable: in any case, at least one block will move / fall 2. Likely unstable: probably at least one block will move / fall 3. Can't say: The subject is not sure about stability 4. Probably, no block will move / fall 5. Definitely stable: No block will move / fall The most important questions we seek in answering our study are as follows: 1. How well do people perform the task?"}, {"heading": "4 Experiment", "text": "Our experimental analysis consists of two main parts: The first part examines whether and to what extent a largely model-free test of visual stability can be learned directly from the data; the second part relates these findings to the same stimuli in relation to human judgments."}, {"heading": "4.1 Visual Stability Prediction", "text": "In fact, we are able to go in search of a solution that is capable of finding a solution to all the problems."}, {"heading": "4.2 Human Judgment on Synthetic Data", "text": "In fact, it is the case that people are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want.

We evaluate our model based on a number of conditions, including variations in the number of blocks, the size of blocks, and the 3D structure of the entire tower. The results reflect the challenges of increasing complex inference as the structure increases in size, as well as challenges due to small characteristics on which stability is based due to closures or block size variations. Based on these encouraging results, we envision systems that exploit such data-driven notions of physics to arrive at advanced methods that explain the physical state during visual inference. We will also examine richer production spaces than binary labels that shed more light on the quality of the physical understanding acquired through the learning-based approach."}], "references": [{"title": "A model of physical reasoning in infancy", "author": ["R.
