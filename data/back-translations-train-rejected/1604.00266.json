INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "2. THE GENERAL AND THE SPECIFIC", "text": "The emphasis placed on the relationship between syntax and semantics is reflected in studies of the general. It discusses in great detail the reasons for the use of general linguistic formulas from the point of view of the individual meaning that the general term includes. It tries to answer questions such as: Does the text mean the least group? Does the general term have a meaning that is universal or specific? Does the general term apply to all individuals? Obviously, all these questions of language are common, whether natural or formalized like algebraic logic (QLn & Qgic). Fiqh also provides studies on the case of the individual contained in a general term. It has been recognized that the individual can be addressed without using a general linguistic formula. In such a case, the reference is made by using a description that applies to the individual without further details. The reference to the case of the individual contained in a general term can sometimes be limited by other descriptions that are not contained in the text itself (Figic & Qn)."}, {"heading": "3.

ANALOGY", "text": "So the most important thing is the secondary analogy, i.e. the need to make a judgement on a secondary question and the clarity of the ground on which a judgement is based. All these are primary and religious judgments (QLn & SF). An absolute analogy cannot be achieved without maximum certainty about the reason for the decision on the primary question and maximum certainty that this very reason applies to the secondary question9. For example: it is explicitly forbidden to say the word \"Ugh\" to the parents of one. Scholars have decided by analogy that it is also forbidden to hit the parents of the other. It is certain that the reason for the prohibition to say \"Ugh\" to the parents of the other is that it violates them. Accordingly, it is assumed that they cause greater injury."}, {"heading": "5.

LOGIC & COMPUTER SCIENCE", "text": "Since the beginnings of algorithmic processing, namely computer science in the early 1940s, it has been recognized that any technology for automating logical conclusions could have enormous potential to solve problems by drawing automated conclusions from a given fact. To this day, the most powerful and expressive formal method for describing and analyzing information is First Order Logic (FOL). In this abstract and formal context, logic should be merely the concept of what follows from what, for example, if two statements x, y are true, then a third statement z can be derived from it, while it does not matter whether one of the statements is actually true! The formal, i.e. syntactic quality is simply that if x and y are true, then z must also be a logically valid statement."}, {"heading": "7. MATHEMATICAL LOGIC AND FORMAL LOGIC", "text": "As a brief overview, far from being formal, mathematical logic comprises two constitutive features of the system presented here: first, it intends a complete and concise formulation of formal logic (including FOL) 23 insofar as complex mathematical theorems can be expressed in simple, singular formal propositions. (cf. [Whitehead / Russell]) This has the reductionist advantage that, secondly, mathematical axioms in arithmetic, algebra, geometry, etc., can be described by countable many logical calculations in terms of statements about classes, relationships, and syntax. (cf. [Frege]) This has the formal advantage that the second constitutive property of mathematical logic, after the \"Western\" 24 understanding, was first understood by Leibniz. (1646-1716) in his \"Characteristica Universalis.\" (cf. [Gerhardt] The symbolism, the hierarchy of classes, the rules, the tactical linking of the human system are... \""}, {"heading": "8. THE STRUCTURE OF LOGIC SENTENCES", "text": "This formal system, as a whole, represents an artificial language similar to natural languages if they have a system of spelling and grammar that identifies possible sentences and distinguishes them from incorrect expressions. Thus, for example, we cannot say that it contains an error of symbols, since the arrow symbol (indicating the material implication) cannot be used twice in succession; the structure of formal logical languages, especially the simple ones intended for the study of mathematics, should include five sets of symbols of logical statements (QLn); 2. Symbols of conjunctions (Qc); 3. Symbols of variables (Qv); 4. Symbols of Rules (Qg); 5. A set of grammatical and dictatorial rules that distinguish structurally clinical-sounding sentences for QLone."}, {"heading": "9. SEMANTICS OF LOGIC SENTENCES", "text": "Based on the above formula, we come to the conclusion that propositions are first of two types wrong: The first type contains variables of type Qv, which are called general propositions, such as Sen. 1 and Sen. 2. The second type has no variables. It contains only predicates and logical conjunctions, such as Sen. 3. However, we will designate this type of detailed propositions in such a way that it will not be difficult for us to generate the meanings of the detailed propositions based on the CS, even if they are logically merged, because we know the meanings of the symbols through QLn and also the meanings of the logical conjugations between these symbols. However, when we try to establish the meaning of the following formula, we are confronted with some important problems: (F's general symbols through QLn and also the meanings of the logical conjugations between these symbols."}, {"heading": "10.

SenN) \u2665 M Such a formal system is called a formal system."}, {"heading": "11. COMPLETENESS AND DECIDABILITY OF FIQHSYSTEMS", "text": "Some famous formal systems that are weaker than FOL, but both complete and decidable are among others: Propositional calus, the set of FOL validities in the Sign, the set of FOL validities in a-Que, and the set of first-order Boolean algebras. It is also known that any complete, recurred and recurred initial description of the theory of first order is decidable. 36 The term decidable refers to the decision problem that raises the question of the existence of an effective method of determining membership in a set of formulas, or more precisely, an algorithm theory that can return a true or false value. Logical systems such as propositional logic are decidable if the membership in its set of logically valid formulas (or theorems) can be determined effectively."}, {"heading": "12. COMPLEXITY OF", "text": "An important aspect with regard to all formal logic systems that are complete and decidable: the most well-known derivative methods require an exponential number of steps in the worst case. A prominent example of such systems is the propositional logic. Although the decision on the best formal system to use for Fiqh must be subject to thorough investigation, which ultimately results in a tailor-made formal system designed specifically for Fiqh, we consistently base our approach on the propositional logic. Accordingly, the following two trivial propositions, which relate to general and detailed sentences of Section 9: Deriving detailed sentences (by substituting into general unit40) is efficient, i.e. in the worst case scenario, the propositional logic of Fiq.Fiof: Straightforward substitution of values into a detailed logic limited to a general uniformity of 28qs."}, {"heading": "13.

ALGORITHMIC IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "The need to view Fiqh within a formal framework of logic is complementary to the urgent need to rewrite the Fiqh reference works in a style that is easy to understand by contemporary readers. Furthermore, the rewriting should take into account the need to provide solutions to practical problems in an increasingly complex and differentiated world. Among other things, this stance is supported by Al-Zuhayli (1350 AH / 1923 AD -): there is nothing that would preclude a recast of Islamic Fiqh in the form of articles that would make it easier for a judge, lawyer or ordinary person to refer to his judgments. Indeed, this is one of the most pressing needs of our time. Old books of Fiqh are not simply referenced for a decision on a particular issue, except by a specialist. Indeed, the entire body of Fiqh needs to be reorganized and rearranged."}, {"heading": "15.
