The common characteristic of VSIDS and its variants is to make use of statistical information in the solving process, but ignore structure information of the problem. For this reason, this paper modifies the decision variable selection policy, and presents a SAT solving technique based on BCD (Blocked Clause Decomposition). Its basic idea is that a part of decision variables are selected by VSIDS heuristic, while another part of decision variables are selected by blocked sets that are obtained by BCD. Compared with the existing BCD-based technique, our technique is simple, and need not to reencode CNF formulas. SAT solvers for certified UNSAT track can apply also our BCD-based technique. Our experiments on application benchmarks demonstrate that the new variables selection policy based on BCD can increase the performance of SAT solvers such as abcdSAT. The solver with BCD solved an instance from the SAT Race 2015 that was not solved by any solver so far.

Usually, the logical form of a clause C is marked as C = x1, in which each clause is a letter clause. In the clause with only one letter clause, a unity clause is called a unity clause. A CNF formula F is marked as F = C1."}, {"heading": "3 Related Work", "text": "Theoretically, each CNF formula can be divided into two blocked subsets, so that both can be solved by BCE (Blocked Clause Elimination). Therefore, we can assume that a blocked set of a CNF formula is C1, C2, C2, Cm, where Ci (i = 1, 2,..., m) is a clause. Balyo et al. [3] re-encodes each clause Ci, so that the re-encoded formula is more easily solved than the original formula. Its re-encoding can be described as follows. Each blocking literal xi may have several versions. In the order Cm, Cm \u2212 1..., C1, each of its versions is defined, assuming that the clause Ct has the form Ct = xi, yj1, Ct = xi, yj1."}, {"heading": "4 Decision Variable Selection Policy Based on Blocked Clause Decomposition", "text": "In this section we describe a new SAT solution technology based on BCD."}, {"heading": "5 Empirical evaluation", "text": "We reviewed the performance of SAT | F, where the BCD and without BCD the number of blockers has been blocked each for three years. < M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M,"}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we presented a BCD-based improvement strategy for SAT solvers that differs from that of Balyo et al. [3] Common to both strategies is that they begin to pay off after a sufficiently long time. If a given time span is very short, there is no improvement compared to SAT solvers. Compared to the Balyo et al approach, our approach is simple, does not need to be re-coded and has no application limitations. In addition, the BCD-based recovery of Balyo et al. is pre-processing, while our BCD-based mode is a solution strategy. The selection of decision variables is a very important component of CDCL-SAT solvers. Our BCD-based policy of variable selection has solved an instance that has not yet been solved by any solver. However, it only seems to be suitable for a part of the cases."}], "references": [{"title": "Predicting learnt clauses quality in modern sat solvers", "author": ["G. Audemard", "L.
