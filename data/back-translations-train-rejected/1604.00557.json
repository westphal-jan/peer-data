The purpose of these controllers is to manage the network congestion under varying loads, link delays and bandwidth. In this paper, a new AQM controller is proposed which is trained by using the SVM (Support Vector Machine) with the RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernal. The proposed controller is called the support vector based AQM (SAM) controller. The performance of the proposed controller has been compared with three conventional AQM controllers, namely the Random Early Detection, Blue and Proportional Plus Integral Controller. The preliminary simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed controller is comparable to the conventional controllers. However, the proposed controller is more efficient in controlling the queue size than the conventional controllers.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Apr 2016 20:47:51 GMT  (318kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00557v1", "8 pages, Mehran University Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, Vol 33, No.1, January 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, Mehran University Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, Vol 33, No.1, January 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["muhammad saleh shah", "asim imdad wagan", "mukhtiar ali unar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00557"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.00557.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "SAM: Support Vector Machine Based Active Queue Management", "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The purpose of this control is to manage the network contacts under different conditions, and the proposed control is called AQM."}, {"heading": "2.

SAM: SVM BASED AQM", "text": "The idea behind this controller is to actively manage the queue using a machine learning algorithm. SVMs are machine learning algorithms and proven classifiers used in various areas.SAM uses SVM algorithm and its design is flexible to use different SVM kernels. This research contains only RBF kernel responses or simulation results of the proposed controller compared to other existing controllers (RED, Blue and PI).The proposed controller uses buffer usage (queue size) patterns for packet drop decision.It records the buffer usage pattern at the time of arrival of the last five packets. This research also includes a method to generate the feature vector from the possible dataset of buffer usage patterns. The SAM requires a data model after the training. The SVM model is generated by training on the selected dataset. The decisions of the proposed controller are directly based on the SVM file and the SVM proposed by the controller during the training session."}, {"heading": "4.

Response of Blue is the worst with lot of oscillations and high queue size than all other controllers."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This new controller will be tested and simulated on the Network Simulator - 2 (NS-2). The proposed SVM-based AQM controller is in contrast to other established AQM controllers such as RED, Blue and PI. Results show that SAM performs approximately the same performance as other AQM controllers, but with an additional advantage of the controlled queue. It has also been observed that SAM was stable throughout the entire scenario. Further research can be done to optimize and improve the performance of the SAM controller. In the future, this AQM controller will be tested with better training models."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "The authors praised the superiority of the Department of Computer Systems Engineering, Mehran University of Engineering & Technology, Jamshoro, Pakistan, for conducting this research."}], "references": [{"title": "Random Early Detection Gateways for Congestion Avoidance", "author": ["S.
