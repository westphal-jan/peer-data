In bicycle-sharing systems, people can borrow and return bikes at any stations in the service region very conveniently. Therefore, bicycle-sharing systems are normally used as a short-distance trip supplement for private vehicles as well as regular public transportation. Meanwhile, for stations located at different places in the service region, the bike usages can be quite skewed and imbalanced. Some stations have too many incoming bikes and get jammed without enough docks for upcoming bikes, while some other stations get empty quickly and lack enough bikes for people to check out. Therefore, inferring the potential destinations and arriving time of each individual trip beforehand can effectively help the service providers schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. In this paper, we will study the individual trip prediction problem for bicycle-sharing systems. To address the problem, we study a real-world bicycle-sharing system and analyze individuals' bike usage behaviors first. Based on the analysis results, a new trip destination prediction and trip duration inference model will be introduced. Experiments conducted on a real-world bicycle-sharing system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 Apr 2016 18:06:36 GMT  (2270kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00664v1", "11 pages, 11 figures, accepted by 2016 IEEE MDM Conference"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 11 figures, accepted by 2016 IEEE MDM Conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI", "authors": ["jiawei zhang", "xiao pan", "moyin li", "philip s yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00664"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.00664.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Bicycle-Sharing System Analysis and Trip Prediction", "authors": ["Jiawei Zhang", "Xiao Pan", "Moyin Li", "Philip S.

DIVVY DATASET DESCRIPTION", "text": "Before analyzing individual travel behavior, we will introduce the dataset through a real-life bicycle-sharing system in this area. The dataset used in this paper is via the Divvy bicycle-sharing system launched in the city of Chicago on June 28, 2013. Initially, it was expanded to include 750 bicycles in an area that extends from the road to the street."}, {"heading": "III. DIVVY USER COMPOSITION", "text": "In order to predict the journeys made by users in the bicycle sharing systems, we first need to understand the composition of the people who use the bicycle. By studying the historical dates of the journey, we list the number of journeys made by \"customers\" or \"subscribers,\" and the statistical results are presented in Figure 1. From Figure 1, we find that the majority of journeys are actually made by the \"subscribers\" (i.e. the green area marked with \"sub\"), who account for approximately 66% of total journeys, while the journeys completed by the \"customers\" (i.e. the grey area) account for a total of 34%. For the \"customers,\" no additional information is available as they only buy a one-day ticket and no personal information is recorded. In the meantime, for the \"subscribers\" with formal membership registrations, we can further investigate them (i.e. gender and age) and their composition. As shown in Figure 1, the \"subscriber section is further divided into the male and female\" sections."}, {"heading": "IV. TEMPORAL TRAVEL PATTERNS", "text": "In this section, we examine the chronological travel of individuals on a Divvy bicycle. First, we examine and analyze the Divvy journey that is undertaken on each day of 2014, from which the cyclical travel of individuals can be observed. Finally, we analyze the distribution of individual bicycle use in each cycle for different cycle lengths (one year, one week and one day). Finally, we also examine the chronological duration of historical bicycle journeys in the dataset."}, {"heading": "A. Trip Temporal Distribution Overview", "text": "The Divvy Bicycle Sharing System provides bike-sharing services throughout the year. To take a look at bicycle usage within a year in the dataset, we count the travel records on every day of 2014 made by \"customers,\" \"male subscribers\" and \"female subscribers,\" with the results in Figure 2. From Figure 2, we observe that people use the Divvy Bicycle every day, but the majority of trips are concentrated within the months of April to November, and the number of trips made during the winter season is quite limited (we will continue to examine monthly bicycle usage in 2014 in Section IV-B. Such a phenomenon can be correlated to the weather in Chicago and, to support such a statement, we also review the historical weather in the Weather Underground3 area. According to the historical weather data in Chicago, the average temperatures in January and February 2014 were lower than the average temperatures in November and December 2014."}, {"heading": "B. Cyclical Travel Patterns", "text": "This year, the number of new arrivals in the US is many times higher than in Europe."}, {"heading": "C. Trip Time Duration", "text": "To study cycling in the real world, we calculate the average ride time in the entire data set to 17.76 minutes. To study the detailed distribution of ride time, we divide the ride time into 6 containers: {< 30 minutes, 30 minutes-1 hour, 1 hour-2 hours, 2 hours-5 hours, 5 hours-10 hours, > 10 hours} and count the number of rides that belong to each container. Figure 4 shows that the number of rides that are less than 30 minutes and are ridden by \"subscribers\" and \"customers\" amounts to 2, 784, 145 and 1, 128, 802, which together represent 90.77% of the total ride time. In other words, the majority of users will return the bike within the free ride time (i.e. 30 minutes) and will not want to pay for the ride time of customers who together account for 90.77% of the total ride time."}, {"heading": "V. SPATIAL TRAVEL PATTERNS", "text": "In this section, we will examine the spatial trajectories of each person. First, we will present the general distribution of Divvy bike stations in the city of Chicago. Next, we will analyze the geo-distances of the journeys made by different groups of people and examine the top 10 stations where individuals often begin and end their journeys, as well as the pairs of stations between which people usually travel."}, {"heading": "A. Station Spatial Distribution Overview", "text": "In Figure 5, we show the distribution of Divvy stations in the city of Chicago, where the blue area and the blue dots are the existing service area and the existing Divvy stations. Due to the enormous travel needs of the public, Divvy expands its service area to broader areas by adding both new and existing service areas, i.e. the red area and the red dots. When comparing the number of stations in the existing and planned service areas (i.e. the blue and red areas), we observe that the station distribution is more dense in the blue region, which also corresponds to the densely populated area in the city of Chicago. The most prosperous area in Chicago should be the loop area, which is also the region where the Divvy bicycle was originally launched. In order to have a clear view of the available stations in the loop area, we also zoom in on the area (i.e., marked in the green dotted square) from which we can add Divvy stations within the extremely dense region and observe many new ones."}, {"heading": "B. Trip Geo-graphical Distance", "text": "For cycling trips made by different groups of people between stations, the distances can vary widely. In Figure 6, we show the distribution of the distances (in km) of \"customers,\" \"male subscribers\" and \"female subscribers.\" Here, the distance from Manhattan [15] is used as a distance measure because the streets in Chicago are very similar to those in Manhattan. We observe that the distribution curves do not exactly follow the distribution of the Electricity Act [2], where most distances are within about 0.5-5 km, while those shorter than 0.5 km or longer than 5 km make up only a very small proportion. In addition, based on historical travel data, we calculate the average distance travelled by \"customers\" and \"subscribers\" (both male and female subscribers) to 2.12 km and 1.91 km respectively. In other words, the distances traveled by customers are slightly longer."}, {"heading": "C. Top 10 Trip Origin Stations", "text": "In Figure 7, we show the top 10 Divvy bike stations from which \"customers,\" \"male subscribers\" and \"female subscribers\" usually start their journey, including the ranking of stations with station badges and station names. In addition, we also indicate the number of rides originating from the stations (i.e. the length of the bars), as well as their specific coordinates on the map. Different user categories may also have certain overlaps at the start stations, and some of the overlapped station markers are covered and not displayed. Thus, Station 174 serves both male and female subscribers as the most visited station, but the icon corresponding to the \"female subscribers\" is hidden by those of the \"male subscribers\" on the map, and some of the overlapped station markers are not displayed."}, {"heading": "D. Top 10 Trip Destination Stations", "text": "In addition to the launch stations, we also show the top 10 stations where people usually end their journey, i.e. the destinations of their journey, and the results are in Figure 8. From Figure 8, we can see that the top 10 stations of the \"male subscribers,\" \"female subscribers\" and \"customers\" are quite similar to those in Figure 7. For example, 7 of the top 10 terminals of the \"male subscribers\" and \"female subscribers\" have ever appeared in the corresponding ranking of the origin stations, and the top 10 terminals of the \"customers\" are even identical to their origin stations as shown in Figure 7, but the travel numbers are identical."}, {"heading": "97. M useum", "text": "The possible explanation for such a phenomenon may be that for many users, bicycle rides are usually bidirectional. In other words, if they travel from station A to station B for certain events (which can be \"to work\" for subscribers or \"sightseeing\" for customers), they also have to return after the events. Therefore, station A and station B serve as both starting and finishing points for these two rides."}, {"heading": "E. Top 5 Frequently Traveled Station Pairs", "text": "In general, different Divvy bike tours are intended for different purposes, and the purpose can be understood more clearly by considering departure and destination stations at the same time. For example, if the bike ride departs from a residential area and the destination is a campus, the rider is likely to be a student and use Divvy bike to commute from home to schools; while the departure and destination stations are both attractions, the rider mainly uses the Divvy bike for sightseeing. Motivated by this, we show the top 5 most frequently traveled pairs of stations by \"male subscribers,\" \"female subscribers,\" and \"customers\" in Figure 9, where the departure and destination stations are listed and marked on the map. From Figure 9, we observe that the top ranking Divvy station pair for \"male subscribers,\" \"Station 283 \u2192 Station 174,\" where Station 283 \"for female subscribers\" is Station 174, \"Station 283 for Chicago's office building is full (Chicago's 174)."}, {"heading": "VI. TRIP PREDICTION PROBLEM FORMULATION", "text": "Based on the above analysis, we will introduce the prediction problem in this section. The prediction problem examined in this paper aims to derive the destination station and the end time, since a user borrows a bike from a Divvy station at a certain time. We propose to formulate the problem as the starting point and destination station. In other words, for a specific user who borrowed a bike from a known Divvy station at a certain time, the prediction problem targets a number of potential destinations in the decreasing order of their probability that the bike will be ridden at the same time as the travel duration."}, {"heading": "VII. TRIP PREDICTION MODEL", "text": "To address the travel forecast problem, we will present the forecast model in detail in this part. First, we will introduce the functions extracted for pairs of stations based on user information, start time and stations. Next, we will briefly discuss the specific models used in this paper."}, {"heading": "A. Features about the user", "text": "In the preceding sections of the data analysis, user types (i.e. \"customer\" versus \"male\" versus \"female\") have significant influences on cycling routes both at the destination stations and on the duration of the bike ride. Therefore, we propose to extract three characteristics about users based on the personal user information, including \u2022 User type: \"customer\" normally behaves very differently from the \"subscribers\" when using the bike by Divvy (see illustrations in Section IV and V). To distinguish them from each other, we propose to extract the function x1. If the user u is a subscriber, then x1 = + 1; otherwise x1 = \u2212 1. \u2022 User gender: \"male\" uses the bike more frequently and its activity region is concentrated around the Chicago Loop area, which differs from the \"female\" users (see Figures 7, 8 and 9), in order to define the gender we stand for x2, where we stand for the gender = 2."}, {"heading": "B. Features about the departure time", "text": "In addition to the user information, the use of the Divvy bicycle also correlates with the start time of the trip. Thus, people use the Divvy bicycle more frequently in the summer; \"customers\" tend to use the Divvy bicycle on weekends; \"subscribers\" use the Divvy bicycle mainly during peak hours. Therefore, depending on the start time of the trip, 3 different characteristics are extracted: \u2022 Month of travel time: Winter and early spring in Chicago are not suitable for cycling (see Figure 3 (a)). To indicate the month of travel start time, we define the function x4 in the newspaper, with x4 = 1 if the trip takes place in January, x4 = 2 if it is in February, and so on. \u2022 Day of travel: For subscribers and customers, they have completely different patterns of use on different days of the week (see Figure 3 (b).) To use this information, a new function x5 is introduced."}, {"heading": "C. Features about the stations", "text": "In Figure 9, we have shown some of the most frequently diverted pairs of stations from different user categories. Therefore, the source station can provide important information to be able to infer the destination station as well. Three different features about the stations are extracted in the experiments: \u2022 Station pairs: In Figure 9, we show that some pairs of stations can often be traveled by users. The first station has the station pairs extracted for (so, sd), i.e., x7 = ID (((so), ID (sd))). \u2022 Station Geographical Information: In addition to ID information, we also have the geographical information about the stations that can be displayed as station pairs (width, length). The coordinate pairs are also used as a feature that is x8 = width (so), length (so), width (so), width (so), width (sd), length (sd), length (so d)."}, {"heading": "D. Trip Destination Station Inference Model", "text": "For the prediction problem of the destination station, we propose to assign it to a binary classification in the experiments. For each departure and destination pair (e.g., (so, sd), we assign different names to it to indicate whether a particular journey starting at sd ends at sd or not. To solve the problem, we propose to use a state-of-the-art paired regression algorithm, namely MART (Multiple Additive Regression Trees) [16], to develop a regression function. MART is based on the stochastic approach to increasing the slope described in [5], [6], which optimizes the slope in the function space. In our experiments, we used the protocol probability as a loss function, the steepest descent as an optimization method, and binary decision trees as a suitable function. For more information about the MART model, see [5] [6] [13]."}, {"heading": "E. Trip Duration Inference Model", "text": "To predict the duration of the journey, the same characteristics are applied to form the duration of the journey inference model. Various regression models can be used as the base prediction model, and without any loss of generality, we will apply the lasso regression model as the base regression model in this essay, which fits to a linear equation t (so, sd) = \u2211 k i = 1 bixi + b0, where t (so, sd) is the derived travel length between stations so and sd, where Term bi represents the coefficient of characters xi and b0. To obtain the coefficient values in the formation of the model, Lasso uses the previous L1 as the regulator, and the optimal coefficients can be learned by solving the following equation argmin b (so, sd) (t (so, sd) \u2212 t (so, sd) \u2212 t (so, sd) \u2212 t (sd | 1), where t (so, sd) is the term between the trip and the trim."}, {"heading": "VIII. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "To test the effectiveness of these two models in solving the travel prediction problem, we are conducting experiments with the real Divvy bike rental system (presented in Section II). In this section, we will first present the test settings, which include the test setup, comparison methods and evaluation metrics. Next, we will show the test results and give detailed analyses."}, {"heading": "A. Experiment Settings", "text": "In fact, it is a way in which people are able to determine for themselves how they want to behave."}, {"heading": "B. Experiment Results", "text": "The experimental results are in Figure 10 and Figure 11. Figure 10 shows the results of the trip end prediction and Figure 11 gives the results of the trip duration conclusion. By comparing all with the other methods in Figure 10, we can conclude that all other methods with significant advantages can be consistently outperformed by various metrics. For example, in Figure 10 (a), the accuracy achieved by ALL is 0.87, which is about 21% higher than the accuracy achieved by USER (i.e., 0.72); 4% higher than the accuracy score achieved by STATION (i.e., 0.84); and 43% greater than the accuracy score achieved by TIME (i.e., 0.61). Similar results can be observed in Figure 10 (b) -10 (d), where precision, recall and F1 are used as a yardstick."}, {"heading": "IX. RELATED WORK", "text": "In recent years, bicycle-sharing has received increasing attention as initiatives to increase bicycle use improve the link between the first and last mile and other modes of transport and reduce the environmental impact of our transport activities. DeMaio provides a full introduction to the history, impacts, models of delivery and the future of bicycle-sharing systems in [3]. Midgley provides a full overview of work on bicycle-sharing systems, management, policies and opportunities in [10]. A large number of other reviews and case studies on bicycle-sharing systems have appeared to date [17], [14] which examine bicycle-sharing systems from various angles and directions."}, {"heading": "X. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper we investigated the problem of route prediction for bicycle sharing systems in order to derive the potential destination station and the duration of the ride. Detailed analyses of the user composition of a real bicycle sharing system, the temporal usage behaviour of bicycles and the spatial usage behaviour of bicycles were carried out. Based on the results of the analysis, two new regression-based inference models were introduced in this paper to predict the potential destination station or the duration of the journey. Experiments carried out with the data set of the real bicycle sharing system show the effectiveness of the proposed model."}, {"heading": "XI.

cities. In bicycle-sharing systems, people can borrow and return bikes at any stations in the service region very conveniently. Therefore, bicycle-sharing systems are normally used as a shortdistance trip supplement for private vehicles as well as regular public transportation. Meanwhile, for stations located at different places in the service region, the bike usages can be quite skewed and imbalanced. Some stations have too many incoming bikes and get jammed without enough docks for upcoming bikes, while some other stations get empty quickly and lack enough bikes for people to check out. Therefore, inferring the potential destinations and arriving time of each individual trip beforehand can effectively help the service providers schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. In this paper, we will study the individual trip prediction problem for bicycle-sharing systems. To address the problem, we study a real-world bicycle-sharing system and analyze individuals\u2019 bike usage behaviors first. Based on the analysis results, a new trip destination prediction and trip duration inference model will be introduced. Experiments conducted on a real-world bicycle-sharing system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
