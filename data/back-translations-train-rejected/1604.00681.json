Different mechanisms have been implemented to capture these opinions such as \"Like\" in Facebook, \"Favorite\" in Twitter, thumbs-up/down, flagging, and so on. However, in more contested domains (e.g. Wikipedia, political discussion, and climate change discussion) these mechanisms are not sufficient since they only deal with each issue independently without considering the relationships between different claims. We can view a set of conflicting arguments as a graph in which the nodes represent arguments and the arcs between these nodes represent the defeat relation. A group of people can then collectively evaluate such graphs. To do this, the group must use a rule to aggregate their individual opinions about the entire argument graph. Here, we present the first experimental evaluation of different aggregation rules presented in the literature. We use randomized controlled experiments to investigate which rules people consider better at aggregating opinions under different conditions. Our analysis reveals a number of factors, not captured by traditional formal models, that play an important role in determining the efficacy of aggregation. These results help bring formal models of argumentation closer to real-world application.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 Apr 2016 19:58:18 GMT  (493kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00681v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 12 Feb 2017 18:38:35 GMT  (745kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00681v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["edmond awad", "jean-fran\\c{c}ois bonnefon", "martin caminada", "thomas malone", "iyad rahwan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00681"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.00681.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Experimental Assessment of Aggregation Rules in Argumentation-enabled Collective Intelligence", "authors": ["Edmond Awad", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bonnefon", "Martin Caminada", "Thomas Malone", "Iyad Rahwan"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Experimental Assessment of Aggregation Rules in Argumentation-enabled", "text": "Collective Intelligence Edmond Awad, The Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA; Masdar Institute, UAE Jean-Franc ois Bonnefon, Center for Research in Management, Toulouse School of Economics, France Martin Caminada, School of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University, UK Thomas Malone, Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA Iyad Rahwan, The Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA; Masdar Institute, UAEOn the Web, there is always the need to aggregate opinions from the masses (as in posts, social networks, forums, etc.) Various mechanisms have been implemented to capture these opinions, such as Facebook, Favorite on Twitter, thumbsup / down, flagging, etc. However, in more competitive domains (e.g. Wikipedia, political discussions, forums, etc.) these mechanisms must be effective in the discussion of climate change."}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "In many online systems that support collective intelligence (e.g. Wikipedia, question-and-answer systems, and discussion forums), different conflicting views arise, even on the basis of the same information [Apic et al. 2011; Marvel et al. 2011; Introne et al. 2011], raising the challenge of supporting consensus-building among members of the community. However, many systems on the Web use arbitrary aggregation rules to handle such tasks, due to the lack of clear appropriate rules given the existing attitudes and the difficulty of assessing potential alternatives. Furthermore, the scalability and complexity of consensus-building in online systems makes the use of traditional voting rules inadequate. To address the difficult task of finding appropriate aggregation rules for systems as complex and scalable as those used on the Internet, one must consult the vast amount of literature on voting and aggregation, starting with the establishment of election theory."}, {"heading": "1.1.

Abstract Argumentation and Labeling Aggregation Rules", "text": "In order to make reasonable judgments about arguments, a formal representation of arguments is required. Arguments and the relationship between them can be represented as a directed graph in which nodes represent arguments, and arcs between nodes represent binary defeat relationships about them. An argumentation framework is known as an abstract argumentation framework, proposed by Dung [Dung 1995]. In the previous example, you can see that arguments B and C defeat each other, and argument B defeats arguments A.Definition 1.2 (argumentation framework). An argumentation framework is a pair AF = < A, > where A is a finite set of arguments and A is a defeat relationship. An argument beats an argument b when (a, b) an argument is written (sometimes a b)."}, {"heading": "1.3. Hypotheses", "text": "First, and as explained in [Caminada and Pigozzi 2011], one of the main advantages of SSCOs is that their (compatible) results can be defended by any person involved in the decision. If laymen perceive this advantage, then experimental manipulations stressing the need for all stakeholders to defend the result should be the preference for SSCOs over AWPR.One can imagine various such manipulations, of which we will test three, from the weakest to the strongest: a simple reminder of the consequences of the vote; a statement informing participants that every voter should support and defend the group's decision; and a statement informing participants that if the group's decision turns out to be wrong, everyone in the group would share the responsibility. We consider this latest manipulation to be the strongest, because even if the group members accept to defend a decision made against their vote, they may not be willing to share the blame if that decision is wrong. In fact, Ronnegard [Rigozzi 2015] argues that while all the committee's decision is partisan, the responsibility is not attributable to a member of the SSCO4."}, {"heading": "2. METHOD", "text": "A total of 400 participants, all residents of the United States, were recruited from the Crowdflower online platform between March 23 and May 17, 2015, each receiving $0.25 compensation. Each participant read six vignettes, each depicting a committee trying to make a collective decision on a deal. Relevant arguments were listed in each vignette, either two in the case of simple reasoning charts or four in the case of complex reasoning charts (this variable had no effect on the results and is not being discussed any further). The vignettes showed how the committee voted on each of these arguments, and the task of the participants was to indicate whether, on the basis of these votes, the committee should accept Conclusion A (the AWPR result) or declare itself undecided (the outcome of the SSCO). Finally, the vignettes stated that the group would be undecided to move the decision to another panel."}, {"heading": "3. RESULTS", "text": "Figure 3 shows the average proportion of responses favoring plurality as a function of decision-making (color-coded), the voting ratio, and whether the decision causes personal harm; the width of each field in Figure 3 indicates the 95% confidence interval for these proportions; a field that overlaps with the gray line indicates that participants in this state do not show a significant preference for both aggregation methods; as suggested by Figure 3, participants showed a general preference for AWPR. Overall, 64% of responses were consistent with AWPR, and this percentage was significantly higher than the chance in 11 of 16 experimental conditions - SSCOs, on the other hand, were never significantly preferred in any experimental condition. However, the preference for AWPR was qualified by contextual factors; visual exploration of Figure 3 suggests that the framing of the decision did not significantly influence participants."}, {"heading": "4.
