There can be more than one consistent way to evaluate such an argumentation graph. Collective argument evaluation is the problem of aggregating the opinions of multiple agents on how a given set of arguments should be evaluated. It is crucial not only to ensure that the outcome is logically consistent, but also satisfies measures of social optimality and immunity to strategic manipulation. This is because agents have their individual preferences about what the outcome ought to be. In the current paper, we analyze three previously introduced argument-based aggregation operators with respect to Pareto optimality and strategy proofness under different general classes of agent preferences. We highlight fundamental trade-offs between strategic manipulability and social optimality on one hand, and classical logical criteria on the other. Our results motivate further investigation into the relationship between social choice and argumentation theory. The results are also relevant for choosing an appropriate aggregation operator given the criteria that are considered more important, as well as the nature of agents' preferences.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 Apr 2016 21:48:37 GMT  (1179kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00693v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 20:02:55 GMT  (886kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00693v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["edmond awad", "martin caminada", "gabriella pigozzi", "miko{\\l}aj podlaszewski", "iyad rahwan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00693"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.00693.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Pareto Optimality and Strategy Proofness in Group Argument Evaluation (Extended Version)", "authors": ["Edmond Awad", "Martin Caminada", "Gabriella Pigozzi", "Miko\u0142aj Podlaszewski", "Iyad Rahwan"], "emails": ["irahwan@mit.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 4.00 693v 2 [cs.A I]"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "2.1 Abstract Argumentation Framework (AAF).2The groundbreaking paper by Dung [24] introduced the basic concept of the abstract argumentation framework, which can be represented as a directed graph, in which the vertices represent arguments (ignoring details about their contents) and the directed arcs represent the defeat relationships between these arguments.

Collective argument evaluation is the problem of aggregating the opinions of multiple agents on how a given set of arguments should be evaluated. It is crucial not only to ensure that the outcome is logically consistent, but also satisfies measures of social optimality and immunity to strategic manipulation. This is because agents have their individual preferences about what the outcome ought to be. In the current paper, we analyze three previously introduced argument-based aggregation operators with respect to Pareto optimality and strategy proofness under different general classes of agent preferences. We highlight fundamental trade-offs between strategic manipulability and social optimality on one hand, and classical logical criteria on the other. Our results motivate further investigation into the relationship between social choice and argumentation theory. The results are also relevant for choosing an appropriate aggregation operator given the criteria that are considered more important, as well as the nature of agents\u2019 preferences. 1 ar X iv :1 60 4. 00 69 3v 2 [ cs .A I] 7 A pr 2 01 7", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
