The proposed method will enable a confidence calculation that was previously subjective and unpredictable."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "There are many trust definitions expressed in natural languages. In order to enable confidence calculation in computer systems, the trust definitions must be communicated in a measurable or quantifiable notation, such as in statistical representations. The first attempt to represent trust in statistical notations was made by (Dempster, 1967). Dempster demonstrated a probability measurement intended to define a higher and lower probability for multi-layered mapping. The probability measurement is a generalization of the calculation in Bayesian theory. His statistical scheme is adopted by (Shafer, 1979, 1976) and represents an elegant method for calculating trust. Many researchers later (1980-1995) treated both works as the basis for a concrete trust calculation, which they began to call the Dempster-Shafer theory in the early 1980s (Shafer, 1). This manuscript is a draft version. The final version will be published in a respected journal. You can contact the main static (contact @) of the trust theory for further information on 1997."}, {"heading": "Trust Algebra: Definition and Notation", "text": "In fact, it is the case that the individual countries are a country in which it is a country in which it is a country in which it is a country in which it is not a country in which it is not a country.

Cluster events or groupings of related events for specific properties reduce complexity in determining the values of properties and help shorten the search time of all data in public domains (e.g. Internet, messages, etc.). If at least a single event related to the given properties is found, the given properties are included in a trust calculation. It may not be strong enough to provide solid evidence of the given properties, but it will help to enable confidence calculation. DempsterShafer's evidence theory can also be applied to event verification, but requires too much effort. 6 0.05 Kill or arrest other diplomats from another nation.

The purpose of the trust algebra method is to enable trust calculations and trust modelling.
