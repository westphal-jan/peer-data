Contrary to Chomsky's formalisms, the elementary objects manipulated by TAG are trees; structured objects, not strings. Such structured formalisms have properties that directly relate to strong generative capacity (structural descriptions), which is more linguistically relevant than string sets (weak generative capacity). Therefore, we call TAGs a tree-generating system and not a string-generating system. The amount of all trees derived in a TAG form the object language, so in order to describe the derivation of a tree in the object language, we need to know about \"derivative trees.\" The derivative trees are important in both syntactic and semantic senses. TAGs also have some interesting linguistic properties that can be brought in synthetic lexical form, as well as a normal lexical contexture, where both the verbal research is a motivational as well as the linguistic research."}, {"heading": "2 Formalism", "text": "TAGs were introduced by Joshi et al. (1975) and later Joshi (1985). It is known that trees adjacent to languages (TALs) generate some strictly context-sensitive languages and fall into the class of so-called \"mildly context-sensitive\" languages (Joshi et al, 1991). TALs actually contain context-free languages and are duly contained in indexed languages. We will give an overview of the TAGs and then continue to observe the lexical symbols. A tree, first connected to grammar (TAG), consists of trees associated with indexed languages. (NT, I, A, S) wherei is a finite set of terminal symbols."}, {"heading": "2.1 Adjoining Constraints", "text": "Therefore, from the original definition of connection to n (characterized by n), we can add additional constraints that may or may not be applied to a node. Basically, an auxiliary tree \u03b2 will be attached to the node n of \u03b1 if the root node of \u03b2 is also n (characterized by n) and no substitution to the node of \u03b1. Now, the newer constraints will only take effect in satisfying the above basic constraints, which are as follows: Selective Addition (SA (T), abbreviated): Only elements of the group of auxiliary trees can be appended to the given node. The addition is not mandatory. Zero Addition 1 (NA, abbreviated): It prohibits any adjunction to the given Node.1 zero addition corresponds to a special case of selective addendum SA (T) where T is a zero."}, {"heading": "2.2 Derivation Structures", "text": "When we define the derivative tree for the set where the necessary elementary trees are needed to derive the trees, the information for the history of this combination is not given. Unlike CFGs, the derivative tree does not contain information about what basic rules (in our case, elementary trees) were used to construct it. Therefore, we ask for a new object that gives us information about all the operations and elementary trees used to construct a derivative tree. This example was taken from Joshi and Schabes. Derivative 3 illustrates the derivative tree for the above English sentence, but this tree does not give any relevant information about how it can be constructed. Therefore, we define the derivative tree for the set."}, {"heading": "2.3 Lexicalization", "text": "Dre rf\u00fc nde eeisrVnlrteee\u00fcgr rf\u00fc ide eeisrrrteeVnlrrrrteeeeeeeVnlrrrrrrteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrlrrrrrrrrlrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}, {"heading": "3 TAG Tamil Syntax Mapping", "text": "Here we propose converting tree frames for a limited class of verbs (53 tree families after one version) in English to Tamil. Tamil is a SOV language and is different from English, which is an SVO language in the tree configuration. English is both right-branching (= head catch) and left-branching (= head end), while Tamil is a strongly left-branching (head end) language. This difference between English and Tamil will be reflected in many structural configurations of English and Tamil. For example, this addition (this embedded sentence) in English follows the matrix configuration, where, as in Tamil, it usually precedes the matrix configuration."}, {"heading": "3.1 Intransitive: Tnx0V", "text": "Adverbs, preposition philosophies, and other adjuncts may be adjacent, but are not required for sentences to be grammatical. 1,878 verbs choose this family.

NP's can be complex structures, including rounded NP's and NP's that have sentential complements, which do not include light verbal constructions. 4,337 verbs choose the transitive tree family. The verbs eat, dance, take, etc. take this tree; examples of sentences are: \"Al ate an apple,\" \"Seth danced the tango,\" \"Hyun takes an algorithm course,\" and \"Anoop thinks it is good that the semester is over.\" Tamil and English assignments are given in fig. 6."}, {"heading": "3.3 Ditransitive with PP: Tnx0Vnx1pnx2", "text": "This tree family is selected by ditransitive verbs that take on a noun phrase followed by a prepositive phrase, the preposition is not limited to the syntactic lexicon, the preposition must be required and not optional - that is, the sentence must be unrammatic only with the noun phrase (e.g. John laid the table), so no verbs should choose both this tree family and the transitive tree family. There are 5 verbs that choose this tree family, for example the verbs enconce, put, etc. Sentential examples: \"Mary has settled down on the sofa,\" \"He has placed the book on the table,\" and \"He has led the patrons to the theater.\""}, {"heading": "4 Parsing Analytics and Examples", "text": "Vijay-Shankar and Joshi (1985) developed O (n 6) CYK parsers for TAGs. This was the first practical parser for the entire formalism. Later, [Schabes and Joshi, 1988] described their Earley-type TAG parser algorithm with extensions to various derived formalisms as well as constraint tags. This was our guide to the modified practical implementation that we will discuss. We have several modifications and deviations that we have made to the actual parser. In addition, Joshi and Schabes (1997) proposed a diagram parser algorithm that was partially adopted by us and combined with a multi-string implementation of the same for TAGs. The main advantage of an Earley parser is that it has a complexity of the worst cases of O (n 6), which in most cases works much better than a parser compared to the average complexity of the CYK parser."}, {"heading": "4.1 Tamil parse specifics and examples", "text": "The grammar the parser uses for Tamil contains over 120 trees correctly and is regularly pruned to reduce ambiguities. We have 25 initial trees and 95 auxiliary trees. Together, they address most constructs of simple and direct sentences. The parser accepts sentences marked with the Penn tag using the same sentence. If the sentence is within the construct range of the grammar, the parser immediately returns TAG derivatives from which it is easy to construct derivative trees. As mentioned before, we are not currently engaged in morph analysis just to keep our focus on grammar and parsing. In the examples here, we are predominantly surface shapes with some chucks in them. Our goal is to prove the conformity of the TAG syntax for Tamil in the broader sense."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Further development", "text": "Although we have not discussed morphological considerations here, we claim that we can handle TAGs very efficiently. Feature-based parsing is very easy because the dependencies are maintained by trees and no separate dependency grammatics are required. Our main goal is to apply these techniques in multilingual applications predominantly in machine translation, and the synchronized grammar methodology is well suited for such future efforts."}], "references": [{"title": "The syntax of French de-N phrases", "author": ["A.
