In many applications it is important to recognize goals and plans not only accurately, but also quickly. In this paper, we develop a heuristic approach for recognizing plans based on planning techniques that rely on ordering constraints to filter candidate goals from observations. In the planning literature, these ordering constraints are called landmarks, which are facts or actions that cannot be avoided to achieve a goal. We show the applicability of planning landmarks in two settings: first, we use it directly to develop a heuristic-based plan recognition approach; second, we refine an existing planning-based plan recognition approach. Our empirical evaluation shows that our approach is not only substantially more accurate than the state-of-the-art in all available datasets, it is also an order of magnitude faster.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 14:44:03 GMT  (139kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01277v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 17:56:47 GMT  (442kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01277v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 01:15:59 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01277v3", "Accepted as short paper in the 22nd European Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ECAI 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ramon fraga pereira", "felipe meneguzzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.01277"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.01277.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Landmark-Based Plan Recognition", "authors": ["Ramon Fraga Pereira", "Felipe Meneguzzi"], "emails": ["ramon.pereira@acad.pucrs.br", "felipe.meneguzzi@pucrs.br"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "As more computer systems require considerations about what agents (both human and artificial) do besides themselves, the ability to accurately and efficiently detect targets and plans from agents \"behavior is becoming more and more important.

Their work uses a heuristic, optimal, and modified suboptimal planner to determine the distance to each goal in a series of objectives after observation. Succession work [15] suggests a probabilistic plan recognition approach using standard planners. However, in most areas, these approaches provide a high level of accuracy that is lower than our threshold-based approaches, and their detection time ranges from twice slower to an order of magnitude slower. Pattison and Long [13] suggest IGRAPH (AUTOmatic Goal Recognition with A Planning Heuristic), a probable heuristic target recognition across planning domains. IGRAPH uses heuristic estimation and domain analysis to determine what objectives a planning problem is pursuing."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "We have developed an approach to plan recognition based on planning landmarks and a new heuristics based on these landmarks. Landmarks provide key information about what cannot be avoided to achieve a goal, and we show that landmarks can be efficiently used for highly accurate plan recognition. We have shown empirically that our approach not only delivers superior accuracy results, but also significantly faster detection times for all areas used in state-of-the-art assessment [16], with varying degrees of observation completeness. Our experiments show that disjunctive landmarks in at least one domain have a positive effect on accuracy with minimal impact on detection time, while in some domains these landmarks are either non-existent or produce almost no gain in accuracy at significant speed loss. Knowledge of the domains leads us to believe that disjunctive landmarks are most useful in domains where we assume that domains observed are only suboptimal, such as the CHEN plans."}], "references": [{"title": "Fast and Complete Symbolic Plan Recognition", "author": ["Dorit Avrahami-Zilberbrand", "Gal A.
