The first extension com-bines the smatch scoring script with the C6.0 rule-based classifier to produce a human-readable report on the error patterns frequency observed in the scored AMR graphs. This first extension results in 4% gain over the state-of-art CAMR baseline parser by adding to it a manually crafted wrapper fixing the identified CAMR parser errors. The second extension combines a per-sentence smatch with an en-semble method for selecting the best AMR graph among the set of AMR graphs for the same sentence. This second modification au-tomatically yields further 0.4% gain when ap-plied to outputs of two nondeterministic AMR parsers: a CAMR+wrapper parser and a novel character-level neural translation AMR parser. For AMR parsing task the character-level neural translation attains surprising 7% gain over the carefully optimized word-level neural translation. Overall, we achieve smatch F1=62% on the SemEval-2016 official scor-ing set and F1=67% on the LDC2015E86 test set.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 14:46:18 GMT  (610kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01278v1", "NAACL HLT 2016, SemEval-2016 Task 8 submission"]], "COMMENTS": "NAACL HLT 2016, SemEval-2016 Task 8 submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["guntis barzdins", "didzis gosko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.01278"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.01278.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "RIGA at SemEval-2016 Task 8: Impact of Smatch Extensions and Character-Level Neural Translation on AMR Parsing Accuracy", "authors": ["Guntis Barzdins", "Didzis Gosko"], "emails": ["guntis.barzdins@lu.lv,", "didzis.gosko@leta.lv"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "RIGA in SemEval-2016 Task 8: Effects of Smatch Extensions and Neural Translation on the Accuracy of AMR Analysis Guntis Barzdin, Didzis Gosko University of Latvia, IMCS and LETA Rainis Blvd. 29, Riga, LV-1459, Latviaguntis.barzdins @ lu.lv, didzis.gosko @ leta.lv"}, {"heading": "Abstract", "text": "In fact, most people are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported partly by the Latvian National Research Programme SOPHIS under Funding Agreement No. 10-4 / VPP-4 / 11 and partly by the SUMMA Project H2020 under Funding Agreement 688139 / H2020-ICT-2015.7 https: / / github.com / BLLIP / bllip-parser"}], "references": [{"title": "TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems", "author": ["nanda Vi\u00e9gas", "Oriol Vinyals", "Pete Warden", "Martin Wattenberg", "Martin Wicke", "Yuan Yu", "Xiaoqiang Zheng"], "venue": "Google Research whitepaper.
