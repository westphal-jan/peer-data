In every subdivision of \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0, at least one agent receives a top object (because the preferred order is the same among the agents) and therefore cannot be frustrating.

This protocol, which has been known for ages, has attracted great interest in recent years in both economics and computer science. In this paper, following the work of Brams et al. [9], we have shown that this protocol, apart from its attractiveness in practice, also has a theoretical interest in numerical additive preferences, since it can be used to characterize the efficiency of an allocation by defining an intermediate level between Pareto-optimality and no efficiency at all. Furthermore, we have introduced the simple notion of frustrating (sub-) allocation and have shown that it can be used to accurately characterize the series of sequential allocations. We have also characterized the series of instances for which there is an exact one-to-one relationship between allocations and sequences. Finally, we have highlighted some links between the characteristics of fairness (in particular CEEI) and efficiency."}], "references": [{"title": "Fair assignment of indivisible objects under ordinal preferences", "author": ["Haris Aziz", "Serge Gaspers", "Simon Mackenzie", "Toby Walsh"], "venue": "Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Possible and necessary allocations via sequential mechanisms", "author": ["Haris Aziz", "Toby Walsh", "Lirong Xia"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2015}, {"title": "The Santa Claus problem", "author": ["N.
