Traditionally, belief change occurs by either a revision process or by an update process, depending on whether the agent is informed with $\\alpha$ in a static world or, respectively, whether $\\alpha$ is a 'signal' from the environment due to an event occurring. Boutilier suggested a unified model of qualitative belief change, which \"combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change.\" In this paper, I propose a unified model of quantitative belief change, where an agent's beliefs are represented as a probability distribution over possible worlds. As does Boutilier, I take a dynamical systems perspective. The proposed approach is evaluated against several rationality postulated, and some properties of the approach are worked out.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 19:28:00 GMT  (28kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02126v1", "Presented at the Sixteenth International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, 22-24 April 2016, Cape Town, South Africa. 10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at the Sixteenth International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, 22-24 April 2016, Cape Town, South Africa. 10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gavin rens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.02126"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.02126.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On Stochastic Belief Revision and Update and their Combination", "authors": ["Gavin Rens"], "emails": ["gavinrens@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This means that one can notice some \"signals\" generated by the changing environment, or one can be informed by an independent agent in a static environment that holds some \"facts.\" In the present work, I deal with the belief in uncertainty by maintaining a probability distribution of possible situations.

Boutilier\u2019s model has revision and update more tightly coupled. For this reason, his approach is better called \u201cunified\u201d while mine is called \u201chybrid\u201d. The belief change community does not study probabilistic belief update; it is studied almost exclusively in frameworks employing Bayesian conditioning \u2013 for modeling events and actions in dynamical domains (e.g., DBNs, MDPs, POMDPs) (Koller and Friedman, 2009; Poole and Mackworth, 2010, e.g.). The part of my approach responsible for updating stays within the Bayesian framework, but combines the essential elements of belief update with unobservable events and belief update as partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) state estimation.

(2014); Rens and Meyer (2015). The following version of imaging must not be regarded as a fundamental part of the larger belief change framework presented here; it should be regarded as a placeholder or suggestion for the \u2018revision-module\u2019 of the framework. Informally, Lewis\u2019s original solution for accommodating contradicting evidence \u03b1 is to move the probability of each world to its closest, \u03b1-world. Lewis made the strong assumption that every world has a unique closest \u03b1-world. More general versions of imaging allow worlds to have several, equally proximate, closest worlds.

Traditionally, belief change occurs by either a revision process or by an update process, depending on whether the agent is informed with \u03b1 in a static world or, respectively, whether \u03b1 is a \u2018signal\u2019 from the environment due to an event occurring. Boutilier suggested a unified model of qualitative belief change, which \u201ccombines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change.\u201d In this paper, I propose a unified model of quantitative belief change, where an agent\u2019s beliefs are represented as a probability distribution over possible worlds. As does Boutilier, I take a dynamical systems perspective. The proposed approach is evaluated against several rationality postulated, and some properties of the approach are worked out. Information acquired can be due to evolution of the world or revelation about the world. That is, one may notice via some \u2018signal\u2019 generated by the changing environment that the environment has changed, or, one may be informed by an independent agent in a static environment that some \u2018fact\u2019 holds. In the present work, I deal with belief change of agents who handle uncertainty by maintaining a probability distribution over possible situations. The agents in this framework also have models for nondeterministic events, and noisy observations. Noisy observation models can model imperfect sensory equipment for receiving environmental signals, but they can also model untrustworthy informants in a static world. In this paper, I provide the work of Boutilier (1998) as background, because it has several connections with and was the seed for the present work. However, I do not intend simply to give a probabilistic version of his Generalized Update Semantics. Whereas Boutilier (1998) presents a model for unifying qualitative belief revision and update, I build on his work to present a unified model of belief revision and update in a stochastic (probabilistic) setting. I also take a dynamical systems perspective, like him. Due to my quantitative approach, an agent can maintain a probability distribution Copyright c \u00a9 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

This is in contrast to Boutilier\u2019s \u201cgeneralized update\u201d approach, which takes a most-plausible event and most-plausible world approach. Finally, my proposal requires a trade-off factor to mix the changes in probability distribution over possible worlds brought about due to the probabilistic belief revision process and, respectively, the probabilistic belief update process. Boutilier\u2019s model has revision and update more tightly coupled. For this reason, his approach is better called \u201cunified\u201d while mine is called \u201chybrid\u201d. The belief change community does not study probabilistic belief update; it is studied almost exclusively in frameworks employing Bayesian conditioning \u2013 for modeling events and actions in dynamical domains (e.g., DBNs, MDPs, POMDPs) (Koller and Friedman, 2009; Poole and Mackworth, 2010, e.g.). The part of my approach responsible for updating stays within the Bayesian framework, but combines the essential elements of belief update with unobservable events and belief update as partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) state estimation. On the other hand, there is plenty of literature on probabilistic belief revision (Voorbraak, 1999; Grove and Halpern, 1998; Kern-Isberner, 2008; Yue and Liu, 2008, e.g.). The subject is both deep and broad. There is no one accepted approach and to argue which is the best is not the focus of this paper. I shall choose one reasonable method for probabilistic belief revision suitable to the task at hand. In the first section, Boutilier\u2019s \u2018generalized update\u2019 is reviewed. Then, in the next section, I introduce stochastic update and stochastic revision, culminating in the \u2018hybrid stochastic belief change\u2019 (HSBC) approach. The final section presents an example inspired by Boutilier\u2019s article (1998) and analyses the results. Some proofs of propositions are omitted to save space; they are available on request. Boutilier\u2019s Generalized Update I use Boutilier\u2019s notation and descriptions, except that I am more comfortable with \u03b1 and \u03b2 to represent sentences, instead of A and B. It is assumed that an agent has a deductively closed belief set K, a set of sentences drawn from some logical language reflecting the agent\u2019s beliefs about the current state of the world.
