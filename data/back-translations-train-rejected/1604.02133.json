In this work, an agent's beliefs are represented by a set of probabilistic formulae -- a belief base. The method involves determining a representative set of 'boundary' probability distributions consistent with the current belief base, revising each of these probability distributions and then translating the revised information into a new belief base. We use a version of Lewis Imaging as the revision operation. The correctness of the approach is proved. The expressivity of the belief bases under consideration are rather restricted, but has some applications. We also discuss methods of belief base revision employing the notion of optimum entropy, and point out some of the benefits and difficulties in those methods. Both the boundary distribution method and the optimum entropy method are reasonable, yet yield different results.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 19:41:35 GMT  (25kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02133v1", "Presented at the Sixteenth International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, 22-24 April 2016, Cape Town, South Africa. 9.25 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at the Sixteenth International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, 22-24 April 2016, Cape Town, South Africa. 9.25 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gavin rens", "thomas meyer", "giovanni casini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.02133"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.02133.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Revising Incompletely Specified Convex Probabilistic Belief Bases", "authors": ["Gavin Rens", "Thomas Meyer", "Giovanni Casini"], "emails": ["gavinrens@gmail.com", "tmeyer@cs.uct.ac.za", "giovanni.casini@uni.lu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, the time has come for it to be able to get to grips with the problems that have been mentioned."}, {"heading": "4. d(w,w\u2032)+d(w\u2032, w\u2032\u2032) \u2265 d(w,w\u2032\u2032) (Triangular Inequality)", "text": "When the new information is consistent with the original doctrines, the basic theory or paradigm for studying change of faith is commonly known as AGM theory (Alchourro \"n, Ga\" rdenfors, and Makinson, 1985; Ga \"rdenfors, 1988).

In the latter point, when talking about probabilities or probabilities, when taking a frequentistic perspective, information that is more (less) than \"normal\" knowledge should be observed. Or, without taking into account observation frequencies, an agent could be designed in such a way that one or two sets of deeply rooted background knowledge (e.g. domain limitations) that do not change or are immune to change are different than \"regular\" knowledge. Given that we have found that the basis of belief resulting from the revision of boundary states differs from the basis of faith resulting from the revision of the representative approach to belief, the question arises of when it is appropriate to use a representative state of faith that is defined as the most ropic."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Voorbraak (1999) proposed the Partial Probability Theory (PTT), which allows us to partially determine probability assignments, and where there is a distinction between probable information based on (i) hard background information and (ii) some assumptions.

In this context, an agent's belief base represents the set of beliefs that are compatible with the sentences it contains. In this sense, the agent is able to present his knowledge and ignorance of the true state of the world. We used a version of the so-called imaging approach to implement the revision operation. Two methods were proposed: the revision of a finite set of \"marginal states of faith\" and the revision of a least biased state of faith. We focused on the former and showed that the latter yielded different outcomes. There were two main contributions of this work: The first was to prove that the group of beliefs satisfying Bnew were those that were the original states of faith, the two were the most interesting ones to cover."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Giovanni Casini's work was supported by the Fonds National de la Recherche, Luxembourg, and co-financed by the Marie Curie Actions of the European Commission (FP7-COFUND) (AFR / 9181001)."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": null, "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
