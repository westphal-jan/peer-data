Our framework captures all of the most prominent examples of \"simple\" auctions, including anonymous and non-anonymous item and bundle pricings, with either a single or multiple buyers. The technique we propose is to break the analysis of auctions into two natural pieces. First, one shows that the set of allocation rules have large amounts of structure; second, fixing an allocation on a sample, one shows that the set of auctions agreeing with this allocation on that sample have revenue functions with low dimensionality. Our results effectively imply that whenever it's possible to compute a near-optimal simple auction with a known prior, it is also possible to compute such an auction with an unknown prior (given a polynomial number of samples).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 22:51:04 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03171v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["jamie morgenstern", "tim roughgarden"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03171"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.03171.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Simple Auctions", "authors": ["Jamie Morgenstern", "Tim Roughgarden"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 4.03 171v 1 [cs.L G] 11 Apr 201 6"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people are in a position to understand themselves and that they do not know what to do. \"(S.

Optimal auctions for combinatorial settings are much more complex than for individual parameter settings, even before we ask questions of complexity.

Do article prices for general or even subadditive valuations have a pseudo-dimension O (nk) or strictly greater? 3. Is it possible to classify the allocations resulting from article prices with item-specific reserves as ntimes sequential allocation rules from a simple class, for general valuation functions?
