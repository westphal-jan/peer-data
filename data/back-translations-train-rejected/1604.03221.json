In unattended approaches, pairs of unconnected nodes are initially classified according to a chosen similarity metric (for example, the number of common neighbors) [17,18]. The best k rank pairs are then assigned as predicted links. The strength of this paradigm is that it is simple and generalizes easily to many data types, but there are some limitations: for example, how do you a priori choose the threshold for link assignment? Implicitly, these approaches assume that the links with the highest scores are most likely to occur and form the earliest; however, this is often not the case in many dynamic networks [18]. If the ranking correlation between the selected metric and the sequence of the formed links is bad, then the accuracy of this approach is most likely to be associated with the problem most closely associated with the time class and the pattern in this one at the same time."}, {"heading": "2.1 Time Series", "text": "To construct the time series, the network G observed at that time must be divided into several time-cut snapshots, that is, states of the network at different times in the past. Afterwards, a prediction window is defined that represents how further we want to go in the future to make the prediction. Subsequently, successive snapshots are grouped into small groups called frames. Frames contain as many snapshots as the length of the prediction window. These frames form what is called the Framed Time-Sliced Network Structure (S) [8]. Let Gt be the graphical representation of a network at that time. Let [G1, G2,..., GT] be the frame formed by merging the diagrams from time 1 to T. Let n be the number of periods (frames) in the series. And let w be the prediction window. Formally, S can be: S = {G1, Gw,..., Gw, [], [), [...], [), Gw, [...], [), [...]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Network Similarity Metrics", "text": "In this paper, we use a standard set of topological metrics to assign values to potential connections: 1. Common Neighbors (CN) [19] is defined as the number of nodes with directional relationships to both members of the pair of nodes: KN (x, y) = (x), assuming that the probability of creating a new connection is proportional to the degree of node (y). Therefore, nodes that currently have a high number of relationships tend to create more connections in the future: PA (x, y) = (x). 3. Jaccard's coefficient (JC) [21] assumes that higher values for pairs of nodes that have a higher proportion of common neighbors are relative to the total number of neighbors they have: JC (x, y)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Datasets", "text": "For our analysis, we selected three sets of data: player communications and economic networks from Travian's massively multiplayer online game [10], Enron's popular email dataset [9], and arXiv's co-authorship network hep-th [8]. Table 1 gives the network statistics for each dataset: 1. Enron's email dataset [9]: This email network shows the evolution of Enron's organizational structure over 24 months (January 2000 to December 2001). 2. Travian MMOG [10]: We used the communication and trading networks of users playing Travian's massively multiplayer online game. Travian is a browser-based real-time strategy game in which players compete to create the first civilization capable of constructing a wonder of the world. The experiments in this essay were conducted on a 30-day period in the middle of Xiv's game cycle of 90-month authoring Xiv (a period of two months)."}, {"heading": "3 Method", "text": "RPM treats the link prediction problem as a monitored classification task, where each data point corresponds to a pair of vertices in the social network graph. This is a typical binary classification task that could be addressed with a variety of classifiers; we use the Spark Support Engine (SVM) implementation. All experiments were performed using the standard parameters of the Spark MLlib package: The SVM is provided with a polynomial kernel and a cost parameter of 1. Algorithms were implemented in Python and executed on a machine with Intel (R) -Core i7 CPU and 24GB of RAM. We have provided our code and some sample datasets available at: http: / ial.eecs.ucf.edu / travian.php.To produce a labeled dataset for monitored learning, we need timestamps for each node and edge to track the evolution of the social network over time."}, {"heading": "3.1 Results", "text": "Our evaluation measures receiver characteristics (ROC) curves for the various approaches. These curves show achievable true positive rates (TP) relative to all false positive rates (FP) by varying the decision threshold for probability estimates or values. For all of our experiments, we report on the range below the ROC curve (AUROC), the scalar measurement of power across all thresholds. Because left predictions are very unbalanced, simple accuracy measurements are known to be misleading; in a sparse network, the trivial classifier, which identifies all samples as missing linkages, has an accuracy of 99.99%. In all experiments, the algorithms were rated with stratified 10-fold cross-validation. For more reliable results, the cross-validation procedure was performed 10 times for each algorithm and dataset. We name our algorithm against Supervised-MA [8]."}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "The performance of RPM is based on three innovations: 1) explicit modeling of link formation rates at the node level, 2) the use of multiple time series to use information from previous snapshots, 3) training and testing with the full diffusion of network dynamics. Rate is an important concept in many generative network models, but its use has been largely ignored within discriminatory classification frameworks. Thus, the stochastic actor-oriented model of network dynamics includes a network rate component that is governed by both the time span and the actors. RPM does not attempt to create a general model of how the rate is affected by the characteristics of the actor (node), but predicts the link formation rate of each node with a time series. Time series are useful because they predict the future dynamics based on past changes."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we present a new method of monitored link prediction, RPM (Rate Prediction Model), which uses time series to predict the rate of link formation. By accurately identifying the most active individuals on the social network, RPM achieves statistically significant improvements over related link prediction methods. In contrast to the preferred binding metric, which identifies active individuals by the degree of a single snapshot, RPM measures timed network structures and finds individuals whose influence is rapidly increasing. Our experiments were conducted on networks created through a variety of social processes such as communication, collaboration, and commerce; they show that the rate of link generation varies with the type of network. In future work, we plan to expand this method to simultaneously perform link predictions on different levels of multiplexed networks such as Travian by modelling the relative speed difference between network layers."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgments", "text": "Research at the University of Central Florida was supported by an internal \"Reach for the Stars\" award.
