Today, one particular tweet catches Laila's eye. It looks like a news headline favorable to the Syrian government. Laila clicks on an abbreviated URL in the tweet and finds herself on a news website known to be supported by the Syrian government. Laila suspects that this information may be biased and returns to Twitter. In the results of her search, she notices that the tweet has been retweeted a thousand times.

In fact, some of the earliest bots and botnets were social bots; ASAs. In the following section we look at related literature on social bots. We structure our review around the social infrastructures in which bots were involved; Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Multi-User Domains (MUDs), Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and end with modern social computing systems."}, {"heading": "Bots on Internet Relay Chat (IRC)", "text": "One of the earliest known IRC bots, Eggdrop, appeared as early as 1993 [16]. This bot could be configured to provide a series of triggered actions that helped manage IRC channels. Among the slightly social aspects of the boot were the greeting and greeting of new participants and warnings for some user actions. Many IRC bots were developed with increasing social sophistication. One reason that bots have traditionally been popular on IRC was the ease of implementation and the ability to scale IRC [11]. Much of the studies on IRC bots and botnets focused on detection techniques, tracking and characterization of botnets. Abu Rajab et al. [1] used a multi-faceted approach to track and capture the behavior of IRC-based botnets. The study revealed a number of behavioral and structural features of IRC-based botnets that differentiated from botnet behavior (for example, the botnet behavior localized by six months)."}, {"heading": "Mobs in Multi-User Domains (MUDs & MMOGs)", "text": "The advent of multi-user dungeons (also known as domains) (MUDs) involved the need for automated social agents (ASAs) to enrich the gaming experience; these mobs (mobiles) were not simply passive monsters that could kill players on the basis of experience points; mobs were people in cities, shopkeepers, barons, and government officials who had their own (programmed) motives and goals; players could learn about the environment and advance the game by interacting with the mob; but mobs could also play key roles that regulate the social environment of the game [2,11]. In World of Warcraft (WoW), the mobs often divided the state and included a very simple botnet; despite solid studies of the social aspects of gaming, little work focused on the specific social roles played by the mobs (bots) themselves. With the rapid growth of these online gaming markets (e.g. MMOGs like WoW), a type of online games in which MOGs, like MOGs, were authorised as MOGs, were played."}, {"heading": "Bots in Contemporary Social Computing Systems", "text": "The emergence of social botnets on social networks (SNS) has piqued researchers \"interest in studying this phenomenon and understanding that it has an impact on the social sphere. In 2012, a report by Facebook estimated that 5-6% of all Facebook accounts are fake or fake, which is considered a high percentage for Facebook, as it means that about 50 million users are fake. A study by Boshmaf et al. [3] discussed the use, impact and impact of social bots on Facebook. In their research, the authors designed and built a Socialbot Network (SbN) on Facebook to understand how social bots can be threatened by large-scale infiltration."}, {"heading": "THE SYRIAN SOCIAL BOTNET (SSB)", "text": "The work suggests that social botnets have a far-reaching impact and are only becoming more sophisticated in terms of scanning victims and mimicking human behavior. Much work has been done on automatic detection mechanisms [3, 15], but little has been done to understand the behavior and characteristics of social botnets in social computing platforms. This paper aims to deepen our understanding of the latter. We have captured a Twitter-based botnet in the wild, based on hashtags related to the Syrian civil war in April 2012, which we call the Syrian Social Botnet (SSB). We have followed the SSB for more than six months during the ongoing civil war from April to December 2012. In this paper, we focus on measuring the influence, structure and growth of the SSB. In addition, we present the results of our content analysis on a collection of over 3,000 English and Arabic tweet examples. To the best of knowledge, this is the first such study on the subject."}, {"heading": "Method: Discovering a Social Botnet", "text": "We first started a collection of tweets related to the Syrian civil war in April 2012, about a year after the earliest peaceful protests related to the war. We searched for terms related to Syria (the country) and the names of five major Syrian cities (Damascus, Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, Homs), using both English and Arabic names for each city and country. This first set of data covers 18 months with between 150K and 500K tweets per day and approximately the same proportion of English and Arabic tweets. We relied on retweet data to begin an analysis of the social network, as this action tends to draw more attention to the content of the tweet [4]. During this analysis, we focused on the social structure of certain events during the Syrian civil war (e.g. Houla massacre on May 25, 2012, anniversary of the September 11, 2012 Damascus massacre on December 12, 2012)."}, {"heading": "Growth and Structure of SSB", "text": "For each bot identified, we examined (a) the total number of tweets per week, (b) the total number of retweets per week, and (c) the total number of tweets tweets tweets that survived tweets per week. However, each bot was divided into one of five categories based on different behavioral patterns: short-lived bots, long-lived bots, generator bots, core bots, and peripheral bots.Core bots are the Twitter user accounts that we consider primary SSB users (see Figure 2-D). They typically demonstrate the following behaviors: They typically generate more than 1600 tweets per week (M = 1641), which is approximately every 6 minutes nonstop."}, {"heading": "SSB Content Categories", "text": "Another key question for understanding the SSB is how the content of the botnet differs from users \"regular tweets about the Syrian civil war. We conducted a grounded content analysis of a random sample of tweets from English Twitterers, Arabic Twitterers, and the botnet (which tweets in Arabic), comparing the difference between these three types of tweets. We created a series of grounded categories in several rounds. In the first round, we randomly selected just over 100 tweets from the botnet. A coder (an Arabic native speaker) read through the tweets and proposed a draft coding manual. Afterwards, the research team met to discuss the codes, which led to a first revision of the original codes. Initially, two overarching coding categories were identified: primary code based on theme and secondary code based on geographical context. Initially, we started with a small number of primary codes and two contextual codes of the tweet locally and then we structured the categories into the English-language categories, with the second examples and the English-language categories first being reviewed."}, {"heading": "Primary codes", "text": "Our efforts resulted in 13 primary code categories as follows: 1.1 opinion. Self-descriptive remarks on the ongoing sybian crisis, including (but not limited to): opinions that are typically based on the personal analysis of the situation, of patriotism, of criticism or criticism # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"}, {"heading": "Secondary codes", "text": "These codes are independent of the primary codes: 2.1. Local context. Tweets mentioning the current situation in (and only in) Syria, which is not otherwise specified. Including: key events in Syria, elections and military response. 2.2. International context. Cohen tweets with all mentions of countries surrounding Syria and international organizations such as the UN and Amnesty International. This category mainly includes: reactions from other countries to the situation in Syria, mobilization in support of Syria in other countries and hashtags that list many foreign countries. These categories were developed based on iterative research of examples of tweets, assumptions about the functioning of a message and what we have observed in the previous literature. One assumption we had was that the message would attract attention through the use of references from pop culture, leading to the category pop culture, which has resulted in the category \"spot culture.\" Categories such as our category \"information provisioning\" were reported in crisis information research as a way to mobilize social media or categories that quickly find categories 17."}, {"heading": "Content Analysis: SSB vs. English and Arabic", "text": "In cases where the content at the end of a link was removed, deleted or converted into private and invisible tweets, the encryption decision was based on the content and user name alon.The goal was to have at least 1,000 encrypted tweets from each of the three categories, with all tweets from the \"Uncodeable\" category falling into the \"Uncodeable\" category. Random tweets were generated in multiple rounds of 100-200 tweets each, with the goal of having at least 1,000 encrypted tweets from each of the three categories, excluding tweets from the \"Uncodeable\" category. English tweets were encoded by both SSB and Arabic tweets encoded by another coder, and the team discussed difficult and problematic tweets in each round to reach a consensus code for the most difficult tweets."}, {"heading": "Influence of SSB", "text": "Our last research question was how the SSB might have influenced the discussion on Twitter about the Syrian civil war (\"We decided to look at the top 100 most retweeted tweets for each week of the database\"). We then considered how many tweets the SSB was able to get into the top 100 tweets and what rank those tweets have reached as a fundamental measure of the potential impact of the botnet. It's fair to note that the SSB tweets in Arabic and our analysis here cover the entire 35 weeks of the botnet database, which includes a significant number of English tweets. Thus, the SSB may have had more influence on Arab Twitter users. Nevertheless, given the terms used to collect the data of our analysis, we can start to show what kind of social impact it needs to have. Figure 3 illustrates the trend of the SSB's growing influence over the 35 weeks. Each week we identified all tweets in the top 100 most retweeted."}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this article, we wanted to answer three main questions about a particular social bot network on Twitter: understanding how it grows over time, how the content of tweets from the social botnet differs from normal users of the same dataset, and finally, how the social botnet might have influenced the relevant discussions. Our analysis found some interesting results that sometimes contradict and sometimes support current knowledge about social botnets."}, {"heading": "Mimicking human behaviors", "text": "By mimicking human behavior, bots can go unnoticed and improve their chances of influencing the social graph. Results of our qualitative coding showed that the SSB did not work to mimic human behavior, whatever. Our analysis shows that more than half of the SSB tweets (52.6%) were in the news category, while human tweets (in both English and Arabic) are only about a third of the messages - a big and very detectable difference. Further in the opposite direction, people are likely to have a large proportion of their content expressing a personal opinion about an event (45% for our Arabic sample and 25% for our English sample). Based on the data, the SSB does not seem to have much in the way of expressing an opinion about what is happening in Syria, especially compared to other Arabic languages that express messages."}, {"heading": "Misdirection and Smoke Screening", "text": "We observed two different tactics used by the SSB to divert attention from relevant information (about the Syrian civil war) and influence perception: deception and smoke screening. # Deception is a technique that magicians use to get the audience to look elsewhere when they perform a trick. # Similarly, an ASA network trying to get the audience to care about other content can use miscalculations. # In the case of our SSB tweets, many tweets embedded in the other category serve to hide or obscure some kind of activity. # If the volume of a botnet campaign is high enough with content independent of content, the disjointed content can effectively hide real content. # In the case of our SSB tweets, many tweets are embedded in the other category that relate to foreign news, especially political and natural crises happening worldwide."}, {"heading": "News reporting", "text": "Throughout the encryption phase, the Arabic and English programmers compared notes and discussed differences between the three samples: SSB, Arabic and English. As expected, there were clear differences in the news category between English and Arabic tweets, which appear to be related to differences in language and cultural traditions. However, we did not expect to see the notable difference between the Arabic news coverage and the news coverage of the SSB, as they are both written in Arabic. In the latter, the main difference was the frequent use of strong words in SSB tweets about the opposition, the Free Syrian Army (FSA), and countries that support the FSA by frequently calling them terrorists and posting torture videos. Here are two examples: # Syria http: / / t.co / fEsxv6wH News reporters in Idlib: Armed terrorist groups have kidnapped four units of the Brigade for Public Order at the Bab Alhawa checkpoint # SyriaQaeda member Maen Alrez in the moment of death # Hsyria Syria # Bahrain / # HFria / Homs."}, {"heading": "Lifespan model", "text": "One of the popular conceptualizations of social media botnets is that they explode on the social scene and immediately affect discussions on social media. However, the SSB's lifespan model was somewhat different: the botnet was not built in one day: for 35 weeks, we observed two different stages of its growth. In the earlier phase, from week 1 to 13, the behavior patterns appear to be blurred and irregular (see Figure 1). SSB operators probably experimented with prototypes, especially with the 43 short-lived bots, whose average lifespan was only two weeks. However, after week 14, the pattern begins to stabilize. After week 14, the mean lifespan increased to 28 weeks and the mean total number of tweets per week to 3449. Interestingly, week 14 is the same week in which the generator bot (@ GB1) first started tweeting. We suspect that @ GB1 played a central role in the systemization of the SSB."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This study aims to understand the behavior and characteristics of social botnets on social computing and social media platforms. We presented the results of the three analyses we conducted on the dataset of tweets in which the Syrian social botnet was discovered. The results of the three analyses we conducted on the dataset aim to answer three questions: (i) how has the SSB increased over time, (ii) how does the content of the botnet (in Arabic) differ from the content of regular users tweeting in Arabic, and finally (ii) how the botnet might have affected the entire Syrian civil war discussion. Our results revealed several new and interesting boulders. As social computing systems gain in complexity and popularity, bots and collections of bots will play increasingly important roles. Collective efforts of individual bots are already crucial to Wikipedia's support [8]."}], "references": [{"title": "A multifaceted approach to understanding the botnet phenomenon", "author": ["M.
