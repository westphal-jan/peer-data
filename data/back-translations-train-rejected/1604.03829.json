The research was aimed at exploring the potential use of wireless sensor networks as an early-warning system to help mitigate human-wildlife conflicts occurring at the edge of a forest. There are three important features to the development. Firstly, the sensor platform employs multiple sensors arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array to give it a key spatial-resolution capability that aids in classification. Secondly, given the challenges of collecting data involving animal intrusion, an Animation-based Simulation tool for Passive Infra-Red sEnsor (ASPIRE) was developed that simulates signals corresponding to human and animal intrusion and some limited models of vegetative clutter. This speeded up the process of algorithm development by allowing us to test different hypotheses in a time-efficient manner. Finally, a chirplet-based model for intruder signal was developed that significantly helped boost classification accuracy despite drawing data from a smaller number of sensors. An SVM-based classifier was used which made use of chirplet, energy and signal cross-correlation-based features. The average accuracy obtained for intruder detection and classification on real-world and simulated data sets was in excess of 97%.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Apr 2016 15:26:32 GMT  (2989kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03829v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["raviteja upadrashta", "tarun choubisa", "a praneeth", "tony g", "aswath v s", "p vijay kumar", "sripad kowshik", "hari prasad gokul r", "t v prabhakar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03829"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.03829.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Animation and Chirplet-Based Development of a PIR Sensor Array for Intruder Classification in an Outdoor Environment", "authors": ["Raviteja Upadrashta", "Tarun Choubisa", "A.

INTRODUCTIONAs described above, this project1 concerns the development of a passive Infra-Red (PIR) -based sensor tower platform. The work presented here has been supported in part by an Indo-US project jointly funded by the US National Science Foundation and the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (STP) that distinguishes between humans, animals and windblown plant tangles outdoors. We limit our attention to a small subclass of animals comparable in size and shape to a tiger or dog. In episode 2, we refer to this subclass of animals simply as animals. Even if we are talking about an intruder, the intruder may be either human or animal."}, {"heading": "A. Prior Work", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this project is a project which is, first and foremost, a project."}, {"heading": "A. Block Diagram of a PIR Sensor", "text": "The block diagram of a typical commercially available PIR sensor is shown in Fig. 1. The PIR sensor typically consists of several radiation sensors, called pixels, arranged in the form of an array, with a common shape being an (1 \u00d7 2) arrangement, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). We refer to this (1 \u00d7 2) PIR sensor, simply as a PIR sensor. The pair of pixels in the (1 \u00d7 2) arrangement are wired together in different ways to overcome false alarms triggered by changes in ambient temperature. A lens system is typically used to expand the sensor's field of vision (FoV) and plays a key role in defining the sensor output signal. The lens system is used to focus radiation from different directions on the pixels and consists of a single lens or multi-console."}, {"heading": "B. PIR Signal Generation", "text": "1) Radiation model: The first step in determining the signal generated by a PIR sensor is to estimate the net radiation received from the source. Assuming that the source can be modelled as a Lambertian source, i.e. as a source radiating the same energy in all directions, the net current transmission is [10] w (t) = \u03c4\u03b7FAeAproj (t) \u03c3 (T4 obj \u2212 T 4b) \u03c0R2, (1) where \u03c4 detects the attenuation due to the atmosphere, \u03b7 is the transmission coefficient of the lens, F is a fraction of the total radiation within the bandwidth of the optical filter, Ae is the area of the lens aperture, Aproj (t) is the area of the source when projected onto the VPA, \u03b7 is the constant of the Stefan Boltzmann constant, Tobj is the object temperature in Kelvin, Tb is the background temperature of the radiation source in the Kelvin and TR is the background temperature."}, {"heading": "C. Challenges Faced in an Outdoor Deployment of a PIR Sensor", "text": "One of the challenges to overcome outdoors is the need to detect and classify clutter. In such an environment, radiation incidence on a PIR could be altered due to changes in the environment, such as when leaves blow in the wind or the sun emerges from behind a cloud."}, {"heading": "III. APPROACH TO PIR SENSOR PLATFORM DESIGN", "text": "Our two main objectives are the rejection of false alarms resulting from the moving vegetation and the distinction between human and animal intruders. Two simple observations were the key to the development of the STP. First, that it is possible to distinguish between humans and animals based on their height. Second, intruders move in nature, while vegetative movements tend to be oscillating. The following assumptions were made: 1) At all times, only one intruder will be present within the FoV of the sensor. 2) Intruders move in a straight line that lies within a specific range: 1 to 3 m / sec."}, {"heading": "B. Use of Vertical Offset to Avoid Overlap Between Rows of the VPA", "text": "The need to make the STP as compact as possible forces the tight placement of the multi-lenses AB and CD. However, the tight placement of the two multi-lenses causes the rows B and C of the VPA to overlap at greater distances from the STP, resulting in a loss of spatial resolution. To overcome this, we resorted to the simple but effective trick of placing the vertically shifting sensors A, B and C, D, i.e. the sensors A, B slightly below the optical axis of multi-lens AB and the sensors C, D slightly above the optical axis of multi-lens CD."}, {"heading": "C. Electronics for Sensor Platform", "text": "The output of the PIR sensor is weak (typically in the order of \u00b5V) and requires amplification. A two-stage amplifier circuit is used to increase the signal amplitude (shown in Fig. 6). Potentiometers are used as feedback resistors in 4The REP05B PIR sensor package, whose pixels are arranged in a 2 x 2 way. The sensor provides two outputs, one for each set of wired pixels. Each amplifier stage provides variable amplification. The amplification is adjusted to maintain a signal with high amplitude but free of saturation. The reason for this is that the signal processing techniques we use to differentiate between different classes depend on the variations in the signal amplitude. To improve the dynamic range of the amplifier, we offer a dual supply of the amplifier."}, {"heading": "D. Operating Range of the STP", "text": "A side view of the FoV of the STP is shown in Fig. 8. The inherent sensitivity of the PIR sensors as well as the divergent nature of the beams that make up the FoV limit the radius of action of the STP. The radius of action of the STP developed here is 5-10m. At distances below 5 m, a small animal like a dog will pass every 4 beams A, B, C, D and will therefore remain undetected, as shown in Fig. 8. In areas beyond 10 m, the sensitivity of the sensors used is not sufficient to guarantee detection with the required accuracy. IV. DATA COLLECTIONA Key step in supervised machine learning is data acquisition. Supervised classification algorithms require marked data from which the machine learns the classification model. The three classes of interest here are humans, animals and dogs in general, with data from animals being collected to a particular extent in the wild."}, {"heading": "V. ASPIRE: ANIMATION-BASED SIMULATION TOOL FOR", "text": "The 3D model consists of a collection of triangles arranged in the form of a mesh approaching the outer surface of the intruder. A central intermediate step in determining the signal resulting from the motion of the 3D model in the FoV of the STP is to find the area of projection on the VPA of the STP. By VPA here we mean the VPA associated with the vertical plane along which the intruder moves. The area of projection of the 3D mesh can in turn be determined by projecting all angles in the STP."}, {"heading": "A. Features Related to Signal Cross-Correlation", "text": "When an intruder moves from left to right, the signals generated by the sensors L1, R1 are slightly delayed and time-scaled versions of each other. A similar statement applies to signals generated by the sensors L2, R2. Consequently, these signals will be highly correlated. Disorder generated by the vegetation whose motion is oscillative rather than translational is unlikely to have a high correlation. The exact amount in terms of the signal correlation used as part of the characteristic vector is the maximum cross-correlation parameter \u03c1max, which corresponds to the signals sLi, sRi, i, i = 1, 2, and specified by: \u03c1max = max = k."}, {"heading": "B. Signal-Energy-Based Classification", "text": "As can be seen from the data in Table II, it is possible to get an indication of the nature of the intruder and the relative distance of the intruder by simply examining the energy of the signals generated in the sensors A, B, C, D. In the table, an entry 0 or 1 indicates that the energy received from the respective sensor is below or above a certain preset threshold. For example, a human intruder typically triggers signals in all four sensors A, B, C, D, whereas an animal intrusion usually triggers signals in the sensors C, D. If only the sensors A, B register signals, this is very likely an indication of disorder. Other conclusions that can be drawn also appear in the table. However, in terms of implementation, the energy from all 8 sensors is fed to an SVM as a feature vector. An important advantage is the relative ease of energy extraction and thus the use of such features, which is conditional on compatibility."}, {"heading": "A. Database Description", "text": "Each database contained a large number of events that corresponded either to human or animal intrusion or to confusion. Each event corresponded to a collection of (8 x 1024) samples of the 8 sensors with a spacing of 50 msec, i.e. a time period of about 50 sec. The breakdown of the databases corresponding to the different event classes is shown in Table III. For each database we used a k-fold cross-validation with 5 folds."}, {"heading": "B. Classification Algorithms", "text": "In the three-way classification that is considered here, there were three feature vectors that we show as: E8 \u21d4 the energy recorded by all 8 sensors. \u2022 The dimension of the feature vector C60 is measured by (5 parameters per chirplet) \u00d7 (3 chirplets per sensor signal) \u00d7 (4 sensor signals) = a total of 60 parameters. \u2022 The results in our previous paper [6] used the holdout method for cross-validation and a smaller range for parameters C compared to what is used in this paper. Parameter C is used in SVM to control the trade-off between margin and permitted training errors. In terms of machine learning, we have relied on SVM. We will use SVM (E8) and SVM (E8) to denote SVM-based classification algorithms that apply E8 and their respective functions."}, {"heading": "IX. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "The paper presents the design of a PIR STP that features the use of (a) a range of PIR sensors and lens combinations to reduce classification. \"We have developed a range of PIR sensors and lens combinations to provide the platform with the spatial resolution required to distinguish between human, animal and vegetative interference signals. (b) ASPIRE, a simulation tool that enabled us to assess the effectiveness of different approaches to classification without the need for time-consuming and challenging animal movement data, and (c) modeling an intruder signal as a waveform that is chirp thatwas effective in distinguishing between intruders and intruders. The overall average accuracy of the classification was determined to be quite high, over 97%.
