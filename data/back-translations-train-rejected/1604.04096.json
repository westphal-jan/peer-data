General creativity forms the basis for a formalized theoretical framework that makes it possible to uniformly describe all creative actors and their behavior within societies of creative systems. In view of the growing number of creative artificial intelligence systems that have been developed in recent years, it is essential to understand how they could influence each other and how to measure their impact on human society. In particular, in this paper, we use the proposed framework to (i) identify different forms of creativity; (ii) describe some typical creative actors; and (iii) analyze the dynamics of societies in which both human and non-human creative systems coexist. Keywords: Computational Creativity, Creative Agents, Framework"}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "Creativity is a broad phenomenon that has long been studied by researchers from various disciplines such as psychology, philosophy, computer science and the humanities. An unanimous definition of creativity is missing due to the numerous, sometimes contrasting, definitions proposed by experts [20]. However, scientists identified the creation of novel and valuable objects as a fundamental characteristic of creative behavior. Until the 1950s, the focus of creativity research was exclusively on humans. In recent decades, given the increasing importance of computer systems within human society, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed that exhibit creative behavior. This field of AI is called computational creativity. The goal of computer creativity is to design creative agents of AI and provide the theoretical framework necessary to describe and evaluate creative systems. However, while a large number of systems have been developed to generate various creative artefacts, few studies are authoritative of creativity: Veleriuko, University of Sheffield,.mail;.UK."}, {"heading": "2. Background", "text": "Although creativity is a loose concept, scientists agree that it is the creation of new and valuable artifacts [23]. Apart from these two elements, researchers generally differ greatly in the way they define creativity [20]. Wallas proposed a ground-breaking model [29] in which the creation of an artifact takes place in four stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. Koestler introduced the concept of bisociation [17], which explains creativity as a combination of two unrelated starting concepts to create a new creative product. Even if it is useful, the theory of bisociation does not describe the creative process in a fully structured way. Finke, on the other hand, addressed the problem by proposing Geneplore [13], a model of creativity based on the creation and refinement of creative systems. Boden approaches the issue from a theoretical perspective and provides insight into various categories of creativity."}, {"heading": "3. Defining Creative Systems", "text": "Before providing a formal framework for describing a general - i.e. non-anthropocentric - creative system, we provide a definition of the expected output of a creative system that is an artifact.Definition 1. An artifact is any element that can be produced either conceptually or physically. According to Definition 1, we emphasize that the product of a creative system can be either physical (e.g. paintings, sculptures) or conceptual (e.g. scientific theories, ideas).Now that we have given a definition of the artifact, we can informally describe a creative system as a system that can create artifacts, and that can be characterized primarily by a process of creating and evaluating such artifacts. Formally, we define a general creative system as follows. Definition 2. A creative system is a 7-fold S: = < A, M, It, It, Evaluates itself as a process of creating and evaluating such artifacts."}, {"heading": "3.1. Artefacts Space", "text": "Our formalization of artifacts space A follows the definition of Wiggins \"universe ([31]).Definition 3. Artifacts space A is a multidimensional space whose dimensions are capable of representing all kinds of artifacts; all kinds of different artifacts correspond to different points in A. In contrast to Wiggins\" definition of the universe, which represents concepts, we have chosen a space populated by artifacts, so that we can consider both physical and conceptual elements. Moreover, an artifact is a \"complete\" concept, since it symbolizes the end product of a creative system. Our framework preserves the axioms universality and non-identity introduced by Wiggins. The former suggest that all kinds of artifacts, including the empty artifact contained in A, are represented in A. In our interpretation, the empty artifact can also be the result of a worthy creative process. The latter axiom claims that each pair of artifacts are more mutually distinct (each pair of arxiaj)."}, {"heading": "3.2. Memory Set", "text": "A system has observed all the artifacts it has already produced, but also artifacts that other creative systems have created and shown it. It is worth noting that a creative system can only observe and store information from artifacts that it can recognize as artifacts. For example, a person cannot hear a piece of music using ultrasound alone, and will therefore not be able to store the corresponding piece of music in memory. Memory, as we define it, is a fundamental part of a creative system, since it assesses the novelty of an artifact in relation to the agent himself. Novelty has been shown to be crucial to creativity [27]. Memory is then used by the evaluation operator to correctly assess the quality of the artifacts."}, {"heading": "3.3. Internal Constraints", "text": "According to Meyer's concept of style, each creative system creates an artifact that selects patterns from a series of constraints [21]. Some constraints are deeply embedded in the system and cannot be overcome. Perception / cognitive constraints, for example, are biologically rooted in humans and do not usually change significantly over the course of a person's life. Of course, there seem to be some counter-examples, such as people experiencing vision loss. In these extreme cases, however, the person changes so radically that he can be considered a new creative actor. The same applies to a computer system that is constrained by a certain amount of computing power. It is possible to replace some parts of the system to improve its computing power, but this leads to a new creative system. We define these deeply embedded constraints, which cannot easily be changed during the life of a system, as \"internal constraints.\" Internal constraints are formally defined as a rule set, but this leads to a new creative system."}, {"heading": "3.4. External Constraints", "text": "We define these as external constraints. External constraints strongly shape both the generation and evaluation process of creative systems, but they can be modified thanks to a system's exchange of information with its peers. For example, culture effectively shapes human constraints. Although some of these constraints are quite difficult to modify, it is possible to vary them by exposing people to a different culture for a sufficiently long period of time. People who study an instrument dramatically change the way they perceive music [14]. The case of computers is similar. They are programmable, meaning that they can change the procedures and values of their software according to external pressure. Just like internal constraints, external constraints can be defined as a set of rules."}, {"heading": "3.5. Generation Operator", "text": "The generation operator is the part of the creative system that is responsible for creating new artifacts. It receives both internal and external constraints as input and returns an artifact a from artefact space A. Formally, we can describe the generation operator as follows: \"Is, It, It, G, A, A, A, A, A, I, R, E.\" In particular, the image of the generation operator of a specific creative system is an appropriate subset of A, and it is worth examining its characteristics. First, it should be noted that both internal and external constraints limit the number of artifacts that the function can return. Specifically, the image of the generation operator of a specific creative system is an appropriate subset of A, and it is referred to as potential generation space A. This is meant to describe the artifacts that could potentially be returned by the generation operator, while we consider Ix, Ex, as input, of course, an external system cannot generate something beyond its internal constraints and, intuitively, the system cannot generate something beyond its internal."}, {"heading": "3.6. Evaluation Operator", "text": "In fact, it is a matter of a way in which most people are able to determine for themselves how they behave. (...) It is as if they were able to behave. (...) It is as if they were able to behave. (...) It is as if they were able to behave. (...) It is as if they were able to behave. (...) It is as if they were able to behave. (...) It is as if they were able to put themselves in a position. (...) It is as if they were able to decide for themselves. (...)"}, {"heading": "3.7. Update Operator", "text": "Although this is not a necessary component of a creative system, the update provider allows the system to show its creativity. Within the proposed framework, the update provider accepts as input an artifact a and the component of the creative system that can be updated. It should be noted that a can be generated by the same creative system, or that it can be the product of other systems. Output is an updated version of the internal components. In particular, the generation provider, the rating provider and the configuration of external limitations can be updated. Formally, the update provider is defined as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5. In our formalization, we consider internal limitations to be unchangeable. Such limitations represent the cognitive boundary of the creative system that can hardly be changed. Although we acknowledge that this can happen in principle - the internal training date - and the proposed limitations do not hold unchangeable."}, {"heading": "3.8. Special Cases", "text": "In fact, most people are able to generate all kinds of artifacts, i.e., they have no external limitations, and their creative capacities are limited only by internal limitations. In fact, the misunderstood genius is able to generate all kinds of artifacts, i.e., they have no external limitations, which have all kinds of configurations of external limitations. In fact, the work of the misunderstood genius is able to generate all kinds of limitations of internal limitations. You have no external limitations to have all kinds of limitations of external limitations."}, {"heading": "4. From Systems to Society", "text": "The production of artifacts within the human realm depends greatly on the relationships between people. A person is influenced by the creative output of other people and at the same time influences the creative behavior of people who happen to look at their artifacts. A society of creative systems is the natural extension of a single system. In the next sections we will discuss what these societies might look like and outline the rules that govern them."}, {"heading": "4.1. Networks of Creative Systems", "text": "Complex networks are graphs with non-trivial topology that are used to model real systems such as organizations, the Internet, and social systems. [30] Relations between creative systems are based on the mutual exchange of artifacts in a nonlinear, usually local manner between multiple systems. This behavior can easily be modeled with the help of a complex network. [4] Our framework describes society by taking advantage of scale-free networks. This is the case since most complex systems based on the exchange of information in the real world, such as the World Wide Web, the human brain, and investment networks, can all be modeled with this graph. Also, some properties of scale-free networks are particularly relevant for modeling a society based on the evaluation of artifacts, and successive updating of the states of their components. Specifically, scale-free networks are characterized by preferential ties that make the rich richer."}, {"heading": "4.2. Generation and Evaluation", "text": "For time, it is possible to identify three categories of creative systems: humans, computers and computer-assisted systems. Even if there are relevant internal differences between elements of the same category, the structure of internal and external constraints is usually similar between systems of the same class. Elements of these three categories together form the creative social network described in the previous section. It is possible to identify the generation and the assessment spaces for each of these homogeneous categories. Generational space for humans is formally defined as A pHum = i = 1A p i, where A pi is the potential generation of human creative systems considered as a whole. Space is the defined union of the potential production spaces of all humans who inhabit the earth at a certain time. A pHum depends on IHum, EHum, which are the sets of all possible configurations of internal and external human configurations."}, {"heading": "5. General Creativity", "text": "There is no unique form of creativity; rather, there are several forms of creativity depending on the types of creative systems involved in the generation and evaluation processes. Specifically, one form of creativity is defined by a pair < < < < < < < v > of generation and evaluation operators. Based on the evaluation operator, it is possible to identify two forms of creativity: anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric. If we look at these two forms together, we get general creativity. In anthropocentric creativity, the evaluation process is conducted by human evaluators, while non-anthropocentric creativity should take place, non-human creative systems should be responsible for the evaluation of artifacts."}, {"heading": "5.1. Anthropocentric Creativity", "text": "Anthropocentric creativity is the only form of creativity that has been extensively studied. Psychologists, philosophers and computer scientists have spent a lot of time unraveling the secret behind this type of creativity. Man is central to anthropocentric creativity, since its ultimate goal is to produce artifacts that can be considered novel and valuable from a human perspective. Thus, the only necessary prerequisite for anthropocentric creativity is the evaluation technician. In other words, it is possible to apply every conceivable generational strategy as long as the result is attractive to a human evaluator. Thus, anthropocentric creativity can be divided into three different subcategories according to the applied generational technique: man for man, computer-assisted for man, artificial for man. Man for man (2H) In this form of creativity, G is the human generational type of creation, which is the primary form of creativity, since it is the creation of human beings for others."}, {"heading": "AI for humans (AIH)", "text": "This form of creativity is the primary area of the study of computational creativity. It consists of artificial systems that are able to produce artifacts that human evaluators might consider creative. Of course, the process of generating anthropocentric creativity is not necessarily related to the way humans would create an artifact. Rather, the generation process uses all kinds of artificial intelligence and artificial life techniques, such as generative grammar, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms."}, {"heading": "5.2. Non-anthropocentric Creativity", "text": "So far, the only form of creativity considered by researchers is the one in which the end users of artifacts are humans. However, by changing the type of creative system that evaluates an artifact, it is possible to bring about a radical change in the form of creativity. Especially if we consider non-human creative systems as systems of assessment, it is possible to go far beyond anthropocentric creativity."}, {"heading": "AI for AI (2AI)", "text": "This form of creativity is formally defined by the pair < < < Ccsg, < Ccs v >, both components being operators of a computer system. This appears to be a seismic change of perspective in the way creativity is conceived that researchers have not yet explored. 2AI focuses on artifacts that are generated by computer systems and are to be evaluated by other computer systems, with specific internal and external limitations. But why should we bother with a form of creativity that we probably do not understand at all? There are at least two good reasons to develop 2AI computer systems: first, by analyzing complex creative systems beyond anthropocentric creativity, we could discover a lot of information about how anthropocentric creativity itself works. Second, this is a way to find and test the limits of the human evaluator, while discovering unpredictable creative outcomes that could amplify the human notion of creative systems beyond the general artefacts of creativity that we might be able to infringe upon."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "Most of the work that has been done in recent decades through artificial intelligence research aimed at enabling agents to create creative effects has been done to date. Because machines have very different limitations from humans, they are potentially able to go beyond anthropocentric creativity by exploring vast regions of artifacts that are beyond human reach. Finally, they do not allow for clear evaluation and simulation of the interactions of societies of creative actors. In this paper, we have introduced universal creativity, which includes both anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric creativity. From this notion, we have developed a theoretical framework that can be used to describe creative effects within a society."}], "references": [{"title": "The creative mind: Myths and mechanisms",

"year": 2016, "abstractText": "Computational creativity is a subfield of AI focused on developing and studying creative systems. Few academic studies analysing the behaviour of creative agents from a theoretical viewpoint have been proposed. The proposed frameworks are vague and hard to exploit; moreover, such works are focused on a notion of creativity tailored for humans. In this paper we introduce General Creativity, which extends that traditional notion. General Creativity provides the basis for a formalised theoretical framework, that allows one to univocally describe any creative agent, and their behaviour within societies of creative systems. Given the growing number of AI creative systems developed over recent years, it is of fundamental importance to understand how they could influence each other as well as how to gauge their impact on human society. In particular, in this paper we exploit the proposed framework for (i) identifying different forms of creativity; (ii) describing some typical creative agents behaviour, and (iii) analysing the dynamics of societies in which both human and non-human creative systems coexist.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
