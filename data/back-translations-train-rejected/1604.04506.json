As such, it has become one of the most important sources of knowledge for anyone interested in performing a task. Online knowledge also has the potential to help machines understand and understand these common sense limitations. [9] However, the potential for applying this knowledge is severely limited due to its lack of structure, diversity of representation formats, and its isolation from other knowledge sources. In this context, we argue that Linked Data is an ideal representation for overcoming these limitations when using know-how on the Web. The main contributions of this paper are: - Describing the first framework that can automate the creation and integration of know-how into the Linked Data Cloud."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Formulation", "text": "The problem addressed in this paper is the effective integration of a certain type of procedural knowledge, which we call human know-how, into the Linked Data Cloud. Integration is considered effective if the quality of the generated links can be better represented as a real benchmark. We define human know-how as the procedural knowledge in which the human being is the main actor. Other known types of procedural knowledge, such as programming languages or business processes, are excluded by this definition, since they are to be carried out by artificial actors such as computers. Formal representation of human know-how presents some unique challenges: - Knowledge can be vague, faulty or missing. For example, the details of how a step is to be carried out could not be specified, because knowledge is distributed across different repositories on the Web. - Knowledge is in constant evolution. New processes can be defined and existing processes can be ronized."}, {"heading": "3 Related Work", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Procedural Knowledge Representation", "text": "However, these systems are not easy and generic enough to present human know-how in a comfortable way. Logical representations such as OWL-S [8] and the Process Specification Language (PSL) [4] require the completeness and correctness of information about a process. Therefore, their application in the field of human know-how is inconvenient because it would be constantly confronted with the problem of inconsistencies and incorrect conclusions. Another limitation of existing languages is the domain specificity. OWL-S, for example, defines a process as \"specifying the way a customer interacts with a service.\" [8] This definition is incompatible with a more general interpretation of a process that does not involve customers or services. Finally, languages may not be expressive enough. For example, the vocabulary currently included in the four steps of the SL definition can also be applied to existing contexts."}, {"heading": "3.2 Human Know-How Extraction", "text": "Several research projects have already attempted to extract human know-how from manually generated instructions. One of the most common approaches, based on Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been used to extract knowledge from domain-independent know-how repositories such as wikiHow5 [1], [6] as well as domain-specific approaches such as the medical field [12]. An approach based on statistical analysis has also been used to extract procedural knowledge from a range of web documents that are not necessarily focused on know-how [3]. These approaches have been used to gain a deep logical understanding of the processes that has led to a loss of accuracy, since most user-generated instructions are inherently vague and cannot be reliably analyzed. Instead, our system does not require a certain level of detail in formalization. Therefore, 4 requires hoki4: / schema5 / http: / schema.org can only be done with a structure."}, {"heading": "3.3 Applications of Human Know-How", "text": "A machine-comprehensible representation of human know-how can be applied in a variety of areas, from gathering information to recommending services. [9] Two notable applications are discussed here, namely activity detection and process automation. The goal of activity detection is to determine an activity (or intention) at the highest level from a series of observations [7]. The intention of making tea, for example, can be derived from the observation of an agent boiling water and placing a tea bag in a cup. Another notable application of formalized human know-how involves the automation of activities. An experiment that attempted this type of automation employed a robotic agent [13]. This agent tried to execute the activity of making a pancake by following user-defined instructions derived from a wikihow."}, {"heading": "4 Methodology", "text": "The integration of human know-how into the Linked Data Cloud requires the solution of a number of different problems, the most important of which are the representation of know-how as linked data and the generation of links to external sources of information. Our framework addresses each of these problems with a different component. Figure 1 schematizes the general workflow of our system. The input of the system is a set of human know-how resources, which are analyzed by the first component of our framework, Knowledge Extraction and Representation, and converted into Linked Data. This Linked Data representation is integrated into the Linked Data Cloud by the second component of our framework: Linked Data Integration. This last component creates two types of links, namely links to DBpedia (DBpedia links) and links between processes (decomposition links). More details on these two components will be provided in the next subsections."}, {"heading": "4.1 Knowledge Extraction and Representation", "text": "In Section 3.1, we discussed several topics in the reuse of existing knowledge languages in the field of human know-how, which leads us to the development of a vocabulary that is both lightweight and ingenious. [10] This vocabulary is sufficient to represent the two main concepts that can be extracted from semi-structured human know-how. These concepts, namely dependencies and decompositions, play a key role in most processual formulas. This vocabulary is based on only three characteristics as shown in Table 1.prohow: It can be used to dissect a complex process into its various parts."}, {"heading": "4.2 Linked Data Integration", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world, where they will be able to move to another world, where they will be able to move to another world, where they will be able to move to where they are."}, {"heading": "5 Implementation", "text": "Our knowledge extraction system analyzed the web pages of wikiHow and Snapguide, two of the largest sources of semi-structured human know-how on the Web. Each web page containing instructions was analyzed and its structure converted into linked data. In total, over 200,000 processes were extracted. Further details about this extraction can be found in Table 2. After extracting the linked data representation of a large number of processes, we applied our linked data integration system. Our system followed the method described in Section 4.2 to discover the links between the DBpedia units and the inputs and outputs of the processes. The results of this experiment can be found in Table 3. Precision was evaluated manually for the inputs (PI) and the outputs (PO) on 300 randomly selected links for each type."}, {"heading": "6 Evaluation", "text": "In order to understand the importance of the issue, we need to link it to a relevant disadvantage."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "This paper describes the initial framework for integrating human know-how into the Linked Data Cloud. Human know-how is an important source of knowledge on the Web, but its potential applications are limited by a general lack of structure and isolation from other knowledge. We have explored attempts to overcome these limitations both through user communities, by attempting to manually add structure and linkages to human know-how, and through existing research projects, by attempting to use this knowledge to develop intelligent systems. However, none of these approaches automated the integration of this type of knowledge. We proposed a Linked Data framework to automate both the extraction of human know-how and its integration with related knowledge. We chose Linked Data as the ideal format for displaying distributed knowledge on the Web. To confirm this framework, we applied it in a real-world scenario. First, this framework generated the Linked Data representation of over 200,000 processes by extracting human know-how from the Web site snapguide and how."}], "references": [{"title": "From Unstructured Web Knowledge to Plan Descriptions", "author": ["A.
