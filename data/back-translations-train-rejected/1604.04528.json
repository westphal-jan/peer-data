However, The tracker often captures unnatural human poses such as discontinuous and vibrated motions when self-occlusions occur. A majority of approaches tackle this problem by using multiple Kinect sensors in a workspace.

However, these methods usually require heuristics to measure reliability of measurements observed from each Kinect sensor. In this paper, we developed a method to improve Kinect skeleton using single Kinect sensor, in which supervised learning technique was employed to correct unnatural tracking motions. Specifically, deep recurrent neural networks were used for improving joint positions and velocities of Kinect skeleton, and three methods were proposed to integrate the refined positions and velocities for further enhancement. Moreover, we suggested a novel measure to evaluate naturalness of captured motions.

A NOVEL MEASURE FOR EVALUATING HUMAN-LIKE NATURAL MOVEMENT", "text": "As mentioned earlier, our goal is to propose a skeletal tracking method, in which captured body joint tracks, however, should be human natural movement.The most popular metrics for evaluating the quality of the skeletal pose is average position error (APE).If APE of a sequence of 3D positions is less than 1 mm, the estimated orbit can be considered as human motion. In fact, this condition is extremely difficult to meet. However, we found that if APEs of two skeletal orbits are 3 cm or 4 cm, in this case, we can not be sure that the better movement is.Let us assume that two tracked orbits. The former is a common orbit that exhibits a large number of small vibrating movements. In contrast, the latter orbit consists of natural movements, but the orientation of the tracked body center is little different from that of the tracked body center."}, {"heading": "VI.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The aim of this work was to propose a method for improving the Kinect skeleton, which vibrates at self-closure and is discontinuous, to a human natural movement. To this end, we first used deeply recurring neural networks to refine the position and speed errors of the skeletal positions, then proposed three methods for integrating improved articular positions and speeds. In addition, we proposed a novel measure for assessing the naturalness of recorded movements. We evaluated the proposed methods against the truth gathered from a commercial motion detection system, and compared the results with those of the Kinect skeleton and several variants of our methods. Our proposed three approaches performed significantly better than the Kinect skeleton tracker, and the proposed integration methods result in a further improvement than if we only refine the Kinect skeleton data with pDRNN."}], "references": [{"title": "Real-time human pose recognition in parts from single depth images,", "author": ["J.
