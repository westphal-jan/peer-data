Despite its crucial importance in the classroom and industry, there is a lack of support for the team formation process. Not only do many factors influence team performance, but the problem becomes exponentially costly if teams are to be optimized. In this article, we propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a gap. It combines artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin's role theory to facilitate the generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool improves current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes into account the feedback of other teammates in order to establish the most predominant role of a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty with regard to each student's predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the estimation of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool in an experiment involving students that took part in three different team activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to improve different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student satisfaction.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Apr 2016 10:50:02 GMT  (1023kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04721v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY cs.HC", "authors": ["juan m alberola", "elena del val", "victor sanchez-anguix", "alberto palomares", "maria dolores teruel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04721"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.04721.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An artificial intelligence tool for heterogeneous team formation in the classroom", "authors": ["Juan M.

Introduction", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "2. The Belbin theory", "text": "Before detailing how the proposed tool was implemented, we believe it is important for the reader to be familiar with the Belbin theory, as it is one of the fundamental pillars of our tool. Belbin Theory [15, 32, 33, 34] provides a thorough analysis of the influence of different roles in teamwork. Belbin defines a role that facilitates the progress of the entire team. Given that there are likely to be limitless patterns of behavior, Belbin explains that the range of behaviors is limited. Belbin defines a role by six factors: personality, mental skills and motivation, field constraints, experience and role models."}, {"heading": "3.

Team formation mechanism", "text": "In this section, we describe our guidelines for dividing students into teams. These guidelines are based on student feedback, generating coalitional structures, and Bayesian learning to form an appropriate distribution of student teams. First, we describe how dividing students into optimal teams equals a generational problem in the coalition structure. Second, we describe how Bayesian learning is used to update classroom information and determine each student's most relevant role."}, {"heading": "4.1. Student team formation as a coalition structure generation problem", "text": "The coalition structure generation problem refers to the division of the components of a set into lei and fragmented coalitions, so that the global advantages of the system are not optimized. In our problem, the components of the set are the students who participate in a classroom team activity.: Definition 1. Let A = {ai,..., to} be a number of students, and let R = {r1, r2,..., rm} perform a number of roles that a student can play (in our case, Belbin's roles), and let rolei denote the dominant role of ai. Let Tj denote a subset of A called team.The value of a team Tj is given by a characteristic function of Tj. (Tj): 2A \u2192 R assigns a real-rated payout to each team Tj. The value of a team v (Tj) is calculated on the basis of the dominant role that each student ai has (rolei)."}, {"heading": "4.2. Estimating students\u2019 roles via Bayesian learning", "text": "After each activity, each student evaluates his or her colleagues by indicating the dominant role of each of his or her teammates. Therefore, new information about the dominant role of each student is available and the history of the evaluations, H, grows. Therefore, with each iteration, the application updates information about the likelihood that a student will have ai r \u2032 i as his or her most relevant role, as the evaluation history p (rolei = r \u2032 i | H). We apply Bayesian learning to this matter: p (rolei = r \u2032 i | H) = p (H | rolei = r \u2032 i) \u00b7 p (rolei = r \u2032 i) \u2022 p (rolei = r \u2032 i) \u2022 p (rolei = r \u2032 i) \u00b7 p (rolei = r) (4), where p (rolei = r \u2032 i) is the oral function and p (rolei = r \u2032 i) the previous probability for the evaluation."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "This tool has been validated in an experimental environment involving real students. Specifically, the experiment was carried out in two consecutive modules of Tourism Studies at the Universitat Polite de Vale Educncia during the academic year 2013 / 2014. The first module takes place in the first semester, while the second is held in the second semester. Both modules are compulsory for students and are placed in the same academic course. Therefore, students attending the first module usually also attend the second module. It may be that some students participate in only one of the two modules (i.e. the first or second module), but one of our objectives is to verify the robustness of the proposed tool in a realistic environment where the tool contains less information about some of the students. The reason for selecting these two modules is that they were taught classically using collaborative learning methods."}, {"heading": "5.1. Experimental setting", "text": "The experiment was divided into three team activities, which were divided between the two modules; the first activity was carried out in the first module, while the second and third team activity was carried out in the second module. Prior to the start of each team activity, the tool proposes a series of teams ranging from 4 to 6 members based on the available information. To prepare the first team activity, the students are randomly divided into teams. We opted for the use of random teams, rather than letting the students decide on their team activities themselves. In total, 77 students participated in the experiment at some point in time. Of this group, 60 students participated in the first team activity and 50 students participated in the second and third team activity. In total, 34 students participated in all team activities, while 19 additional students participated in the second and third team activity. It should be noted that the first team activity serves as a benchmark for team activity and the second and third team activity reflects the effects on team activity."}, {"heading": "5.2. Results", "text": "In order to analyze the performance of the proposed tool in terms of team satisfaction and individual levels, we compared the questionnaires from the first team activity with the questionnaires we received after the second and third team activity. To analyze the data from Likert scales, we first have to categorize the different categories into binary categories (i.e., we are not able to engage in the first team activity and the second team activity). There are two main problems when we study team building in the classroom. On the one hand, many classes are not composed of a large number of students, and therefore the number of samples per experiment tends to be low and it is difficult to include more samples."}, {"heading": "5.2.1. Team dynamics", "text": "The reasons for this are manifold."}, {"heading": "5.2.2. Student satisfaction", "text": "As Table 2 shows, in the last iteration, the proposed tool is able to obtain statistically better answers to 4 of the 5 student satisfaction questions. Specifically, a statistically higher percentage of students rated the team experience as positive and felt more comfortable working in the teams suggested by our team building tool (Q11, Q12), even in the early stages. In the case of Q11, we observed adjusted mean p-values of 0.008 and 0.02, and an increase of 16 and 16 in the ratio of students who perceived positive aspects in the team experience (from 66% to 82%) when comparing the first activity with the second and third team activity. For Q12, we observed that adjusted mean p-values strongly supported the use of our tool in the second and third activities related to the classic team building mechanism (adjusted mean p-values of 0.004 and 0.004). We also observed a dramatic increase in the student-to-student ratio."}, {"heading": "5.3. Other findings", "text": "The data we received allowed us to explore other topics that are indirectly related to student performance."}, {"heading": "6. Related work", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules that they have shown in the past, and they will be able to play by the rules that they have shown in the past."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusions", "text": "In this article, we have introduced an artificial intelligence tool for team building in the classroom, which builds teams based on Belbin's role theory, which identifies eight different behavioural patterns (i.e. roles) found in successful teams. As suggested by the theory, teams are formed with a heterogeneous role configuration, which is derived from the feedback students receive from their team-mates after each team activity. Artificial intelligence allows us to address two important aspects of the tool: (i) it can handle uncertainty about the roles of individuals and feedback from students using Bayean techniques; (ii) it allows us to calculate the optimal team configuration for the classroom in an enormous search space using coalitional structural approaches supported by linear programming; and we tested the performance of the proposed tool in an experiment involving students in three different team activities."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work is supported by the following projects: TIN2014-55206-R, TIN2012-36586-C03-01, PROMETEOII / 2013 / 019, TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R."}], "references": [{"title": "Bridging the gap between industry and higher education: Training academics to promote student teamwork", "author": ["E.

teamwork skills in the educational context. This growing interest is motivated by its pedagogical effectiveness and the fact that, in labour contexts, enterprises organize their employees in teams to carry out complex projects. Despite its crucial importance in the classroom and industry, there is a lack of support for the team formation process. Not only do many factors influence team performance, but the problem becomes exponentially costly if teams are to be optimized. In this article, we propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a gap. It combines artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin\u2019s role theory to facilitate the generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool improves current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes into account the feedback of other teammates in order to establish the most predominant role of a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty with regard to each student\u2019s predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the estimation of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool in an experiment involving students that took part in three different team activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to improve different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student satisfaction.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
