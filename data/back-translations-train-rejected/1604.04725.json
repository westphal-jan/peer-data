Introduction", "text": "This increase has led to a strong academic interest in researching issues related to e-commerce (Ngai and Wat, 2002; Grieger, 2003; Wareham et al., 2005). As of today, most e-commerce systems rely on users manually browsing through their catalogues and selecting which goods they want to buy. This task could end up being time-consuming and suboptimal in terms of user preferences, especially in terms of the number of items and services offered on the websites. Therefore, it is necessary to help customers make better decisions while saving their time."}, {"heading": "2. Overview of the Negotiation Framework", "text": "Let A represent a negotiating team consisting of | A | = M different team members and a trusted team mediator medA, and let A represent a team member in negotiating team A. Let op represent the opposing party of the negotiating team. Negotiation between team and opponent is conducted bilaterally, using an alternative bid protocol (Rubinstein, 1982). In this protocol, one of the two parties is the initiating party and sends the first offer to the other party or responding party. The responding party receives the offer and decides whether he / she accepts the offer or not. Accordingly, he / she may accept the current offer or send a counteroffer. If the responding agent sends a counteroffer, the initiating party must decide whether he / she accepts the counteroffer or not. If the counteroffer is rejected, the process will be repeated in a regular manner until a deal is mutually accepted (successful negotiation) or one of the parties decides to abandon the negotiations."}, {"heading": "2.1. Unanimously acceptable agreements", "text": "Any team member whose benefit is less than the reservation benefit is unacceptable to the team member. As set out in this article, we believe that unanimity is of the utmost importance in a negotiating team. An offer is unanimously acceptable to Team A if it is acceptable to all team members within the negotiating team: as well as A, Ua (X) and RUa. (2) The proposed internal team strategy will ensure that team members only accept offers that are unanimously acceptable to all team members and that the offers submitted to the opponent are above each team member's reservation services, making them unanimously acceptable."}, {"heading": "2.2. Types of negotiation issues among team members", "text": "Among the various negotiation issues that make up the negotiation domain, two examples of two action options (between team members and issues that are unpredictable between team members) are. Formally, we can define a problem with Domain Dj as being compatible between team members, if for any pair of team members one, b, A, and for any pair of output values v1, v2, Dj, the following expression applies, if one of the team members can increase its benefit by selecting a certain output value in relation to the current mapping, then the rest of the team members will remain at the same benefit or they will increase their benefit. Thus, there is no preferred conflict between the output values between team members, and there is full potential for collaboration between team members on compatible topics. Figure 1 shows two examples of two action options."}, {"heading": "2.3. Forbidden unpredictable partial offers among team members", "text": "We define an unforeseeable partial offer X \u00b2 as a partial offer that has a concrete instantiation of all unforeseeable problems in the UN. The benefit of an unforeseeable partial offer X \u00b2 is calculated as Ua (X \u00b2) = \u2211 j \u00b2 UN wa, jVa, j (xj). For a team member, an \"A,\" an unforeseeable partial offer X \u00b2 will never be part of an acceptable offer (i.e., it will never be a unanimously acceptable offer for the team) if the sum of the benefit of X \u00b2 and the maximum benefit that can be derived from unforeseeable problems, maxPRa = \u2211 j \u00b2 PR wa, j is less than its reservation value RUA, since any complete offer X \u00b2 is below the reservation service program.

Case of Study", "text": "In this article we have a case of study (i.e., a negotiation domain) that is extracted from a possible tourism electronic market. The case of the study is used to illustrate and test the proposed negotiation framework. A group of travelers wants to go on a vacation together and arrange their accommodation. The group negotiates with a hotel on the following topics: The price per night that each traveler pays to the hotel for the booking service, ranging from $200, which is the minimum price for the hotel, to $400, which is the maximum price found in the hotel. This negotiation topic is considered predictable and compatible between the team members, as all travelers prefer low prices at high prices. In contrast, the hotel prefers high prices at low prices."}, {"heading": "3. Intra-Team Protocol", "text": "In a negotiation involving a negotiating team, the team protocol defines how and when decisions relating to the negotiations are made. In this context, we propose an internal team protocol, which is governed by the trusted team mediator medA. Essentially, the team mediator governs the interactions that can be conducted between team members and helps team members to make unanimously acceptable decisions within the team during the negotiations. The proposed protocol is clearly divided into two different phases: renegotiation and negotiation. On the one hand, the mediator helps team members identify potential offers during pre-negotiations that are not unanimously acceptable to every team member. On the other hand, the mediator coordinates the offer protest mechanism during the negotiation, which consists of a coordination process for unforeseen issues and an iterated build-up process for predictable issues, and the offer acceptance mechanism for offers that come from the opponent. We describe these phases in detail in the following sections 3.1 and 3.2, with the communication form of the opponent."}, {"heading": "3.1. Pre-negotiation Phase", "text": "During the pre-negotiation phase, the mediator coordinates the following team protocol to determine the number of prohibited unpredictable partial bids for the team. This means that any unpredictable partial bid in the FA is never part of an acceptable bid for at least one team member. Thus, these unpredictable partial bids for the team should be avoided as the objective of the negotiation model is unanimously acceptable. A formal description of the pre-negotiation protocol is presented in Figure 3. The picture describes the protocol using the flow charts for the team, as the objective of the negotiation model is unanimously acceptable."}, {"heading": "3.2. Negotiation Phase", "text": "Two mechanisms are used in each round of negotiations: a mechanism for deciding to accept / reject the opponent's offer (evaluation of the opponent's offer) and a mechanism for submitting an offer to the opponent (offer proposal)."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Evaluation of Opponent\u2019s Offer", "text": "This mechanism is implemented each time the team mediator receives an offer from the opponent. As the main objective of the proposed internal team strategy is to reach unanimously acceptable agreements for the team, a unanimous vote is held to decide whether the opponent's offer is acceptable to the team or not. With this mechanism, as long as one of the team members is not satisfied with the opponent's offer, the offer cannot be accepted by the team, which prevents the team from reaching agreements that are not unanimously acceptable. A formalization of the protocol followed in this mechanism can be seen in Figure 4. The picture shows the formalization using sequence charts from Agent UML. The team protocol used for this mechanism is as follows: First, the team mediator receives the offer Xt from the opponent in due time. If Xt includes a prohibited unforeseeable partial offer in the FA, the opposing offer is automatically rejected."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Offer Proposal", "text": "Making an offer to the opponent is a complex task, as the scope of offers can be huge and the preferences of the team members should be reflected in the opponent's offer, and, in our case, the bid sent should be unanimously acceptable to team members. The process is divided into two phases: the construction of an unpredictable partial bid and the establishment of predictable topics. In both phases, the team mediator acts according to algorithm 3.1. We include a different formal description of the interactions between the mediator and a team member during the offer. This information can be found in Figure 5, which shows the intra-team protocol specified in a sequence chart and Agent UML sequence diagram. \u2022 The first step is to make an unpredictable partial offer.

Team Members\u2019 Strategies", "text": "The team mediator defines the coordination mechanisms within the team. However, each team member's internal strategy has a major impact on team dynamics. In this article, we propose two types of strategies for team members: According to the first strategy (i.e. our basic team member), the team member only proposes unpredictable partial bids based on their own benefit. In the second strategy, team members model the preferences of the team and the opponent based on unpredictable partial bids. Then, each team member selects the candidate who guarantees that they can achieve their current goals at t, and maximizes the likelihood of being acceptable to the opponent and the team. The learning mechanism used by these team members is Bayesian learning (i.e. Bayesian team member)."}, {"heading": "4.1. Basic Strategy for Team Members", "text": "Since the negotiations in our framework are limited in time, we assume that the team members will have to make some kind of concessions if an agreement is to be reached. To this end, we have designed basic team members as agents whose claims are controlled by an individual and private concession strategy. Specifically, the concession strategy for a team member who is a-A is based on time-based tactics sa (t) (Faratin et al., 1998; Lai et al., 2008). It estimates the benefit demanded by a at a given time t by using the formula in Equation 5, where RUa is its reservation benefit, T is the negotiation period, and \u03b2a is the concession speed that determines how quickly the agent's claims towards RUa.sa (t) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 (RUa) \u00d7 (tT) 1 \u03b2a (5) Based on this concession tactic, each team member participates in the team protocol whose demands are defined by its team members \"concession tactics, as we will next evaluate:"}, {"heading": "4.1.1. Evaluation of Opponent\u2019s Offer", "text": "In the case of an offer Xt made by the opponent at the moment t, the team member unanimously votes a positive vote if he declares a benefit greater than or equal to his current demands sa (t). Otherwise, a negative voice.aca (X t) = {true if sa (t) \u2264 Ua (Xt) false else (6)"}, {"heading": "4.1.2. Offer Proposal", "text": "As documented in Section 3.2, team members interact at three points during the Offer Proposal. First, they propose an unforeseeable partial offer to the team mediator. Since each team member has settled their claims through a time-based tactic when submitting an unforeseeable partial offer to the mediator at the immediate time, the proposed partial offer X \u2032 t will be fulfilled: X \u2032 t a / b \u00b2 t a \u00b2 t \u00b2 t (Ua (X \u2032 t a) + maxPRa = t)) (7) Therefore, the agent selects an unforeseeable partial offer that is not prohibited within the team (as it is ignored by the team mediator) and whose usefulness enables him to achieve or exceed his current demands. In this way, the team member assures that if his proposed partial offer is an unforeseen partial offer, the winner of the Borda election will be able to achieve his current demands. However, it should be borne in mind that many unforeseeable partial offers may fulfil the equality."}, {"heading": "4.2. Bayesian-based Strategy for Team Members", "text": "The Bayes-based negotiating strategy for a team member is based on modelling the preferences of the team (as a whole) and its opponent on unpredictable issues and acting accordingly. To this end, two Bayes models are used to predict whether unpredictable partial bids are acceptable to both teammates and the opponent. One of the Bayes models is used to capture the team's preferences on unpredictable issues, while the other is used to capture the opponent's preferences on unpredictable issues."}, {"heading": "4.2.1. Bayesian Learning", "text": "In our case, we want to determine whether the proposed bid will be acceptable to the opponent (or team) (H = {acc, \u00ac acc}) in the face of a certain unpredictable partial bid (e = X \u2032 t) in which acc stands for \"acceptable\" and \u00ac acc for \"unacceptable.\" Assuming that there is no interdependence between negotiation issues, we can consider that each negotiation issue individually contributes to the acceptance of an offer / unpredictable partial bid."}, {"heading": "4.2.2. Offer Proposal", "text": "Bayesian models are used to help select the unpredictable partial bid proposed to other team members. Bayesian team members suggest at least unpredictable partial bids within Equation 7. Bayesian models help select a candidate from that group. However, it is reasonable to believe that the Bayesian model does not accurately reflect the preferences of other agents in the initial interactions. To this end, a team member spends part of the negotiation time exploring the negotiating room and gathering information about the preferences of the opponent and the team. As long as the negotiation process has not exceeded Texp, the team member only randomly selects one of the unpredictable partial bids, as do the basic team members. In the meantime, the Bayesian models are continuously updated with the new information that becomes available during the negotiation. Once the time threshold is reached, the team member begins to use Bayesian models to propose the unpredictable partial bid during the bidding phase and the mediator."}, {"heading": "5. Provably Unanimously Acceptable Decisions", "text": "As stated in the introduction, one of our research goals is to propose a negotiating team model that is capable of guaranteeing unanimously acceptable team decisions. Next, we show that within the framework of as-1wA + wop = 1.sumption of rationality2, team members are able to reach unanimously acceptable final agreements when an agreement is reached. Let's deal with reductio ad absurdum (reduction to absurdity). If X is the final agreement, let's assume that Equation 2 (unanimously acceptable) is violated in a negotiation: unanimity is not achieved because a utility is reached below its reservation utility (reduction to absurdity)."}, {"heading": "6. Experiments", "text": "In this section, we examine the behavior of the proposed negotiation model in various scenarios. The proposed framework was implemented in Genies (Lin et al., 2012), a simulation framework for automated negotiations that allows researchers to test their framework and strategies against state-of-the-art agents designed by other researchers. Recently, Genie has become a widely used tool that expands its repository of negotiation agents with the annual negotiating competition (Baarslag et al., 2012). In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed negotiating approach, we conducted various experiments, all of which were conducted in the negotiation area (or case study) presented in Section 2.4. The first experiment (Section 6.1) examines the performance of the proposed model vis-\u00e0-vis a-vis an individual negotiator. The comparison is performed in scenarios with varying degrees of preference of the team. In the second experiment, we examine the performance of our negotiating team when facing another negotiating team in bilateral negotiations."}, {"heading": "6.1. Performance Against a Single Opponent", "text": "In this first set of experiments, we examine the performance of the proposed negotiating team when facing a single opponent; the study is conducted solely with a focus on observing whether the team's performance is higher by not tying the team members together (i.e., all basic team members) in situations where all team members play the Bayesian strategy; we examine how team performance varies with team configurations ranging from scenarios in which no team members play the Bayesian strategy; as an additional measure of optimism, we also measure the distance to the nearest Pareto-optimal point; in this case, the Pareto-Frontier is calculated taking into account the shared benefit and benefit of the opponent.

Results for the third hypothesis", "text": "The reason for this is that the members of the team have similar preferences (i.e., they are able to trump each other), while the members of the team are able to trump each other (i.e., they are able to trump each other)."}, {"heading": "6.2. Performance Against Another Team", "text": "In this experiment, we analyze the performance of the proposed model when two teams face each other. Specifically, we simulate negotiations in which one negotiating team represents a group of four people, and the other negotiating team represents the board of a hotel that also consists of four managers. The goal of the experiment is to improve the performance of the team when it is a different team. In this context, we use 4 different team preferences to represent the group of travelers and 2 different team preference profiles to represent the board of managers. As we are interested in open environments, we look at different team configurations from the perspective of strategy profiles: No team member plays the Bayesian strategy (0-0-0), half of the team members play half of the team members play the Bayesian strategy in a team."}, {"heading": "6.3.

In addition to discussing other contributions of our current negotiating framework in relation to the work in automated negotiation, in the next paragraphs the authors have proposed access strategies that are a mixture of different families of concessions. The authors divide these concessions into three different families: (i) time-dependent concessions, the tactics of concessions that depend on the way they behave. (ii) resource-dependent tactics, the tactics of the way we use them. (iiii) resource-dependent tactics that we consider time to be the decisive negotiating framework."}, {"heading": "7.2. Agent-based negotiation teams", "text": "In relation to our previous work (Sanchez-Anguix et al., 2011, 2012a, b), we have engaged in bargaining teams in arithmetic models.

The RE model is based on the selection of team members as representatives of the team. Representatives act on behalf of the group by making decisions according to their own negotiating strategy and usability. SSV and SBV are models based on the presence of a mediator coordinating processes."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions & Future Work", "text": "In this article, we have presented a new mediating team negotiating model for a team as a multi-person party that negotiates with an opponent in the alternative range of offers. The current model is capable of reaching unanimously acceptable agreements for all team members. It uses the categorization of negotiation topics as predictable and compatible, and it is unpredictable that the preferred order of topics is known from the negotiation domain, and it is common for team members (e.g. the price in a team of buyers) to prefer these topics while the values in the negotiation are not known."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research is partly supported by TIN201236586-C03-01 of the Spanish Government and PROMETEOII / 2013 / 019 of the Generalitat Valenciana.
