The reasons to employ an agent-based negotiation team may vary: (i) more computation and parallelization capabilities, (ii) unite agents with different expertise and skills whose joint work makes it possible to tackle complex negotiation domains, (iii) the necessity to represent different stakeholders or different preferences in the same party (e.g., organizations, countries, and married couple). The topic of agent-based negotiation teams has been recently introduced in multi-agent research. Therefore, it is necessary to identify good practices, challenges, and related research that may help in advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based negotiation teams. For that reason, in this article we review the tasks to be carried out by agent-based negotiation teams. Each task is analyzed and related with current advances in different research areas.

Tasks for Negotiation Teams", "text": "In this section, we describe the various tasks an agent-based negotiating team may have to perform in different scenarios (i.e., the individual tasks are divided), a review of related literature is performed for each task, and the specific challenges involved in hiring the negotiating team are highlighted. Some authors [35] have suggested the following tasks for negotiators: Identify social conflicts, identify negotiating parties, structure personal information, analyze opponents, define a protocol and choose a negotiating strategy, negotiations (i.e., exchange of offers, reasoning, learning, etc.) and renegotiation. We argue that the tasks proposed by other authors are the right steps for the negotiating parties to follow. However, some additional tasks, especially those involving team coordination, will be introduced to cope with the team scenario."}, {"heading": "3.1. Identify Problem", "text": "The first step is to identify a situation that needs to be negotiated, and the agent must look for partners in his environment and determine whether or not there is a conflict. As Lopes et al. [35] points out, most artificial intelligence researchers have focused on how to reach an agreement, but very few have addressed the problem of conflict detection, the end result of which is a list of potential team members, a list of potential adversaries, and possibly a list of potential competitors. Next, we review various literature solutions to this problem."}, {"heading": "3.1.1. Domain Specific Conflict Detection", "text": "In the multi-agent literature, one can identify works in which conflict detection mechanisms are designed for specific areas such as collaborative planning or air traffic management. In [37, 40] virtual cylinders delimit the protection and warning zone of each aircraft. Conflicts are detected when the cylinders of two different aircraft overlap. Chu et al. [38] propose a conflict detection mechanism for collaborative planning between agents. Agents work towards a common plan by exchanging plan suggestions and beliefs. An actor is able to detect whether a conflict exists or not by reviewing proposals and beliefs in relation to his own belief base. Likewise, Barber et al. [39] propose a conflict detection mechanism when agents integrate their individual plans into a global plan. More specifically, conflicts are detected at the target level (i.e. incompatible goals) or planning level (i.e. threats between actions) using PERT diagrams."}, {"heading": "3.1.2. Domain Independent Conflict Detection", "text": "Some researchers such as Lopes et al. [41] have used axiom libraries (i.e. rule libraries) that allow agents to compare their own plans and intentions with the expected plans and intentions of other agents. Conflict is detected when their own intentions are not consistent with the predicted intentions of other agents. Likewise, it may be possible to express axioms to detect potential partners. The main drawback of this approach is that axiom libraries are static, usually provided by experts, and they cannot learn from new situations."}, {"heading": "3.1.3. Looking for Partners and Opponents", "text": "The search process may be a necessary step for the above mentioned mechanisms of conflict detection. An interesting technology is the search / communication in social networks and markets [42, 43]. Sarne et al. [42] present an efficient algorithm for cooperative search in electronic markets. An agent or group of agents search for goods in the market in order to fulfil different objectives. The algorithm takes into account purchase opportunities (i.e. the likelihood of finding a particular good) and the costs associated with searching for new opportunities. Furthermore, the agents deal with distributions of opportunities in the electronic market. The search is able to be divided into autonomous searches aimed at covering the different objectives of the agent / group. While the search algorithm is interesting because it looks at the search costs of obtaining distributions over partners / opponents for a specific task / negotiation."}, {"heading": "3.2. Team Formation", "text": "Once the agent has determined which agents are eligible as potential partners and which agents can be considered as adversaries, the agent is faced with the challenge of determining whether or not benefits arise from forming a negotiating team. In some situations, it may be mandatory for the agent to be part of a negotiating team. In fact, the team can even be static (i.e. a couple negotiating an apartment with a vendor). If that is the case, identifying negotiating partners and forming a negotiating team are tasks that can be skipped. Nevertheless, some scenarios may be less rigid and the agent may be able to form a negotiating team from the list of potential partners. Therefore, the agent should analyze which team he considers to be the optimal negotiating team according to the list of potential partners."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Coalition Formation", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the case concerns a case in which a person has been injured."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Buyer Coalitions", "text": "Another trend of research in coalition building are buyer coalitions [52, 53, 54, 56]: groups of buyers who come together to take advantage of the volume discounts. In [52], the authors show the incentive for buyers who use volume discounts. [53] They discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the different types of buyers (i.e., pre-negotiation and renegotiation) and present an algorithm for forming buyers in markets where buyers can bid. A mediator collects the bids (i.e., the price is shared with the buyers)."}, {"heading": "3.2.3.

Opponent Selection", "text": "Once the team has been assembled, it is important to find suitable opponents from the list of potential opponents. The team should decide which opponents it will meet. If there are sufficient computing resources available, all opponents can be selected and negotiations conducted in parallel. However, if the computing resources are scarce, a subset of opponents must be selected."}, {"heading": "3.3.1. Opponent Evaluation Mechanisms", "text": "Another classic method of evaluating opponents is trust and reputation. [63] Trust is built as a valuation mechanism based on one's own past transactions / interactions, while reputation is based on the aggregate opinions of actors in society. Trust and reputation is based on opponents who respect trading conditions (e.g. shipment dates, payments, etc.) being rated positively, while assets who violate trading conditions (e.g. delays) or behave wrongly are rated negatively. Generally, Active should select opponents who are rated positively through trust and reputation mechanisms."}, {"heading": "3.3.2. Discussion in Groups", "text": "The expected benefits of negotiating with an opponent and trust evaluations are calculated from an agent's point of view. As the team is composed of more than one agent, the opinions of the various agents may need to be summarized. In fact, there can be conflicts within the team, as team opinions on opponents vary based on different experiences and preferences. In the event of a conflict, agents need to resort to other mechanisms to aggregate the opinions of team members. One of these classic mechanisms is voting [70]. Classic voting systems such as majority voting and Borda counting have the advantage of aggregating opinions with a few interactions, but they cannot be meaningful enough to determine the best option for the negotiating team. If one of the team members has bad experience with a particular vendor, but others have good and recent experience, the team can discard the opinion of the former team member."}, {"heading": "3.4. Understand the Negotiation Domain", "text": "Understanding the negotiation area together is a task of the utmost importance. Not only does it allow team members to understand the preferences of other team members, but it also allows team members to approach negotiations properly when the area is complex and requires expertise in different areas of knowledge. However, even if team members have a similar background, it is still important to understand the negotiation area together. Let's imagine that a group of friends (e.g. Alice, Bob and Charlie) decide to travel and have fun together. What does \"having fun\" mean? Clearly, it can have a different meaning for each friend: Alice thinks that if the city offers many adventure sports, then the journey is fun, then Bob thinks that having fun also means finding a place with considerable nightlife, while Charlie is satisfied with any plan as long as it does not involve a lot of money. From this situation, the price, adventure activities in the travel package and nightlife are relevant negotiation topics for the negotiating team."}, {"heading": "3.4.1. Discussion in groups", "text": "The technologies that can support these processes are manifold: as I said, persuasion and group consultations can help in deciding on a course of action to resolve conflicts [71, 72]. Subject of discussion at this stage are the questions that are relevant to the team during the negotiations. Unlike when advising on the selection of the opponent, in this case the available options and possible negotiation problems are not fully known in advance and must therefore be discovered during the argumentation process."}, {"heading": "3.4.2. Belief Merging", "text": "Other technologies such as merging knowledge and technology [73, 74, 75] can also prove useful in obtaining a common model of the negotiation domain. Merging belief is to merge knowledge that comes from different sources. If there is no inconsistency between different data sources, information can be easily aggregated. However, one of the data sources is completely incompatible with other data sources, special mechanisms must be added as new knowledge. [73] A belief that the algorithm for information that comes from multiple data sources is assumed to be absolutely reliable (e.g. trivial information) in relation to the other. Consistent information is added as new knowledge, while a contraction process takes place in which it is gradually reduced to consistent information through negotiations."}, {"heading": "3.5. Agree Negotiation Issues", "text": "Since the previous phase has produced a list of issues relevant to the team members, the next phase is to agree on a definitive list of negotiation issues with the opponent; the opponent may have his own list of issues relevant to the negotiations; therefore, a definitive list of issues to be negotiated between the two parties should be agreed upon between the two parties; from the initial set of negotiation issues proposed by the team, some of the issues may not be negotiable as the opponent does not offer this service; for example, if the team members originally decided that negotiation packages with adventure activities are a relevant issue for the team, but a travel agent does not work with such packages, the issue may not be included in the negotiations; and some negotiation issues not included in the team's proposed list may be included in the final list, as they are relevant to the opponents, i.e. those negotiation issues that are included in the lists proposed by the team members and the opponent's negotiation issues, which may be necessary to agree on (i.e. the values)."}, {"heading": "3.6. Plan Negotiation Protocol", "text": "Once the list of issues for the negotiation process has been determined, the various parties must agree on a negotiation protocol, unless the protocol is already set by a third party or by the system. In this case, this task and the next task can be skipped. There are different negotiation protocols that can be applied to a particular situation. If, for example, the negotiating team engages in bilateral negotiations with an opponent, both parties could use the classic exchange offer protocol [79], extensions of such protocol such as the alternating offer protocol [80], protocols based on vague compromises [81], two-step protocols based on optimization and concessions [82], or complex mediated protocols such as [83, 84]. The team as a whole may have different opinions and knowledge of the available protocols. In fact, some team members do not even know some of these protocols. In this case, these protocols cannot be used by the team because some players do not know the game rules and decision-making strategies."}, {"heading": "3.6.1. Discussion in Groups", "text": "If at this stage more than one applicable protocol is known to all team members, they should decide as a group which protocols are preferred by the team (i.e. a hierarchy of known protocols).Again, the team can resort to voting [70], reasoning and reasoning [71, 72].Specific Challenges The biggest challenge in this task is how the agents evaluate the various protocols available in the literature. As far as we are concerned, there is no comprehensive study that analyzes which protocols are more appropriate in different situations. Such a study would be necessary to provide the agents with the mechanisms to make informed decisions about the negotiation protocol."}, {"heading": "3.7. Agree Negotiation Protocol", "text": "Considering that the team has already decided which negotiation protocols will be preferred by the team members (e.g. any ranking over the negotiation protocols), it should agree with the opponents on the negotiation protocols to be followed for the interaction. Again, opponents may not know how to play some games, making some of the options unfeasible. Some protocols known to the opponent may not be known to all team members. In the list of protocols known by both parties, both parties may have different preferences and knowledge of the different protocols. This decision between the two parties will involve some kind of simple negotiation (i.e. we do not expect the number of possibilities to be large) or discussion between both parties. In some cases, in addition to the negotiation protocol, some parameters of the protocol must also be decided by both parties (i.e., who is the initiating party in the alternating bid protocols)."}, {"heading": "3.8. Decide Intra-team Strategy", "text": "Negotiation protocols define the rules of interaction to be followed by the various parties. In a single party, decisions are made individually by one agent. However, if the party is made up of several people, it is necessary to decide how, when and which decisions are made and who makes those decisions, referred to as the team strategy or dynamics of the negotiating team. In the case of the protocol on alternating offers [79], each party should decide which offer is made to the opposing party, whether or not it accepts the offer proposed by the other party, and when to withdraw from the negotiating process. Therefore, any team strategy for teams participating in the protocol on alternating offers should decide on these issues. Of course, different decisions must be made for different negotiating protocols, and an internal team strategy proposed for a particular negotiating protocol must not be applied directly to other types of negotiation protocols."}, {"heading": "3.8.1. Simulation Studies", "text": "One of our hypotheses is that there is no single strategy within the team that would be able to outperform the rest of the strategies within the team in all possible scenarios. Depending on the goal of the team (e.g. the performance measurement of social choice measures, etc.) and depending on the conditions of the negotiations, some strategies within the team may perform better than others. Depending on the negotiating conditions, we refer to these factors, either external (e.g. the number of competitors, the number of potential negotiators, etc.) or internal (e.g. team size, similarity between team members \"preferences, time extension, etc.), which can affect the negotiations. Usually, the number of variables is so large that a theoretical analysis is not feasible. Therefore, some researchers have applied extensive simulations to assess which strategies would work better under certain conditions [85, 86, 87, 88]. Oliver et al. [85], Matos et al. [86], Tu et al. [87] and Geregiding [88] are appropriate to indicate that certain [88] strategies are appropriate in certain circumstances."}, {"heading": "3.8.2. Role Allocation", "text": "It may be the case that some intra-team strategies require an additional role / task allocation (e.g., retrieving information, monitoring the market, etc.) This approach may apply to intra-team strategies that require different roles. However, it may be that the actors in a team are insecure and do not know each other. Furthermore, it is a collaborative approach that does not take into account the preferences of the actors."}, {"heading": "3.9. Select Individual Strategy", "text": "Each team member should plan their individual strategy before entering into negotiations. An internal team strategy defines mechanisms for team decision, but they do not define how individual team members behave when playing these mechanisms. It is up to the agent to decide how to act within the team: it can be more or less cooperative. The agent should also determine his attitude towards the opponent. The two above factors determine the initial negotiating strategy of each team member. Generally, the selection of the initial negotiating strategy is based on the expectations of the opponent and the team mates. As explained in the previous section, one of our hypotheses is that the conditions of the negotiating environment play a key role in selecting which team internal strategies are most appropriate for the respective situation. Therefore, team members should also define their individual strategy based on knowledge of the negotiating conditions."}, {"heading": "3.10.

agent-based negotiation team is a group of interdependent agents that join together as a single negotiation party due to their shared interests in the negotiation at hand.

The topic of agent-based negotiation teams has been recently introduced in multi-agent research. Therefore, it is necessary to identify good practices, challenges, and related research that may help in advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based negotiation teams. For that reason, in this article we review the tasks to be carried out by agent-based negotiation teams. Each task is analyzed and related with current advances in different research areas. The analysis aims to identify special challenges that may arise due to the particularities of agent-based negotiation teams.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
