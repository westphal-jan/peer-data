Agent-based negotiation teams are groups of agents that join together as a single negotiation party because they share an interest that is related to the negotiation process. The model relies on a trusted mediator that coordinates and helps team members in the decisions that they have to take during the negotiation process: which offer is sent to the opponent, and whether the offers received from the opponent are accepted. The main strength of the proposed negotiation model is the fact that it guarantees unanimity within team decisions since decisions report a utility to team members that is greater than or equal to their aspiration levels at each negotiation round. This work analyzes how unanimous decisions are taken within the team and the robustness of the model against different types of manipulations. An empirical evaluation is also performed to study the impact of the different parameters of the model.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Apr 2016 11:42:38 GMT  (466kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04728v1", "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics), 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics), 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["victor sanchez-anguix", "vicente julian", "vicente botti", "ana garcia-fornes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04728"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.04728.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Reaching Unanimous Agreements within Agent-Based Negotiation Teams with Linear and Monotonic Utility Functions", "authors": ["Victor Sanchez-Anguix", "Vicente Julian", "Vicente Botti", "Ana Garc\u0131\u0301a-Fornes"], "emails": ["sanguix@dsic.upv.es", "vinglada@dsic.upv.es", "vbotti@dsic.upv.es", "agarcia@dsic.upv.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index terms - negotiation teams, automated negotiations, bargaining technologies, multi-agent systems.I. INTRODUCTIONA Negotiation Team is a group of two or more interdependent individuals who come together due to their similar interests and objectives related to the negotiation and who are all present at the negotiating table [1]. Therefore, this group of individuals unites because their members share objectives related to a negotiation with an opponent. For example, negotiating teams formed by different actors are usually sent to the negotiating table when one company decides to sell a product line to another company. Nevertheless, as has been explained in social sciences, negotiating teams are not necessarily uniform players, as team members have different preferences regarding the possible outcomes of the negotiation process. [2] Given the divergence in preferences between team members, the team must agree not only on a negotiating strategy to execute with the opponent, but also on agreements that are acceptable."}, {"heading": "II. NEGOTIATION MODEL", "text": "Traditionally, a negotiating model consists of a negotiation protocol that defines the actions available to the actors at all times, and a negotiation strategy that defines the decision mechanisms used by the actors during the negotiation. In this article, we present a negotiating model in which a negotiating team negotiates with an opponent. Although it is similar to a bilateral negotiating scenario, negotiations in which teams are used as participants differ slightly, as team dynamics also play a key role. Therefore, three different elements must be defined when a team negotiating model is proposed: the negotiating protocol with the opponent, the negotiating strategy used by the opponent, and the negotiating strategy used by the team members to determine actions during the negotiation process. A team strategy defines what decisions are made by the team and how and when these decisions are made. More specifically, it is defined by the negotiating protocol followed by the team members within the team and by the strategies followed by the actors within the team."}, {"heading": "A. General Assumptions", "text": "In our model, a group of agents is referred to as X = {a1, a2, aM}, whose goal is to negotiate a successful agreement with an opponent op. However, each team member may have different preferences on the negotiation topics. \u2022 Communication between the team and the opponent, however, is conducted by means of a mediator whom the team trusts. This mediator also performs other tasks that allow team members to make unanimous decisions about the opponent's offer to team members. Such is the fact that the opponent is not known to a team that interacts only with the trusted mediator. The trusted mediator also performs other tasks that allow team members to make unanimous decisions regarding the opponent's offer, and whether or not the opponent's offer is accepted. \u2022 The negotiation domain consists of n real attributes attributes attributes whose domains are [0, 1]."}, {"heading": "B. Negotiation Protocol with the Opponent", "text": "This section examines the negotiation process between a negotiating team and an opponent, and the fact that one of the parties is a team is transparent to the other. So, superficially, the scenario resembles a bilateral negotiation scenario. Therefore, we have decided to model the interaction between the team and the opponent as a alternating bilateral negotiation process [5]. In this protocol, one of the two agents is the initiator and sends the first offer to the other party or the responding agent. If the counteroffer is rejected, a new round begins and the process is repeated until an offer is accepted (successful negotiation) or one of the parties decides to end the negotiation (failed negotiation)."}, {"heading": "C.

THEORETICAL ANALYSIS", "text": "In this section, we analyze in detail some important features of our negotiating model. In the first case, the model ensures that each team member receives a benefit greater than or equal to their current level of aspiration; in the second case, we analyze how robust the proposed model is against agents of the opponent, but can easily be attacked by agents of the competition who try to sabotage a deal with the opponent."}, {"heading": "A. Unanimity within the Team", "text": "As mentioned in this article, the proposed negotiating model allows team members unanimity in team decisions. These decisions include the offer sent to the opponent and the acceptance / rejection of the opponent's offers. In the latter case, it is clear that the proposed acceptance mechanism ensures unanimity, since an opposing offer will only be accepted if it is considered acceptable by all team members. In the former case, the definition of unanimity is not simple. We define that an offer to the opponent XtA is a strict unanimous decision for the team if the offer reports a benefit for each team member ai greater than or equal to their current level of aspiration."}, {"heading": "B.

EMPIRICAL EVALUATION", "text": "In this section, we will examine the impact of the various parameters of our proposed model. More specifically, we will examine the importance of the agenda of issues that the mediator imposes on the negotiation process, the impact of the number of decision-making rights transferred during the preliminary negotiations, the empirical robustness of the model against attacks (i.e. agents of competition trying to sabotage the negotiations), and whether team members have incentives to deviate from the proposed strategy or not."}, {"heading": "A.

"In this article, an agent-based negotiation model for negotiation teams that negotiate a deal with an opponent is presented. Agent-based negotiation teams are groups of agents that join together as a single negotiation party because they share an interest that is related to the negotiation process. The model relies on a trusted mediator that coordinates and helps team members in the decisions that they have to take during the negotiation process: which offer is sent to the opponent, and whether or not the offers received from the opponent are accepted. The main strength of the proposed negotiation model is the fact that it guarantees unanimity within team decisions since decisions report a utility to team members that is greater than or equal to their aspiration levels at each negotiation round. This work analyzes how unanimous decisions are taken within the team and the robustness of the model against different types of manipulations. An empirical evaluation is also performed to study the impact of the different parameters of the model.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
