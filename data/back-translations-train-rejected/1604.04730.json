An Example of Automated Negotiation and Ambient Intelligence Synergy: Product Fairs", "text": "In this area, it is possible for consumers to buy their products in other countries as well."}, {"heading": "3. Negotiation Model", "text": "Negotiation models consist of a negotiation protocol and a negotiation strategy. On the one hand, the negotiation protocol defines the communication rules to be followed by the participants in the negotiation process. Specifically, it specifies when the various actors are allowed to send messages and what kind of messages the agents are allowed to send. Thus, the Rubinstein Exchange Protocol [27] stipulates that the agents may alternately submit an offer. Basically, the negotiation protocol functions as a mechanism for coordinating and regulating the agents participating in the negotiation process. On the other hand, the negotiation strategy defines the different decisions that the actor will make at each step of the negotiation process. It includes the adversary's acceptance rule, the selection of which offers should be sent to the adversary, the concession strategy, the decision whether the agent should continue in the negotiation process or not, and so on."}, {"heading": "3.1. Negotiation Protocol", "text": "As mentioned above, the negotiation protocol belongs to the family of alternating protocols for bilateral negotiations. In these types of protocols, two different actors negotiate without the need for an intermediary. As mentioned above, non-mediation strategies for AmI applications are more appropriate as users enter and leave the AmI system in a very dynamic manner. Thus, it may not be possible to find a trusted intermediary for each potential agent pair. Furthermore, in some AmI domains, such as shopping malls, where there are different competing providers and many potential users, it is difficult to determine who mediates the negotiations. The protocol is used to submit the alternating protocol proposed by Lai and al. This protocol consists of several rounds in which the agents exchange offers."}, {"heading": "3.2. Negotiation Strategy", "text": "The proposed negotiation strategy can be classified within the group of strategies that use similarity heuristics to propose new offers to the opponent [6, 20]. The proposal complements some of the advantages introduced in the inspiring work of Lai et al. [20], making it particularly interesting for AmI environments. Second, the proposed strategy provides an implicit learning mechanism that guides the selection of offers while the collected offers are sent to the opponent. The various decision mechanisms of the negotiation strategy can be grouped according to the period in which they are applied. The proposed strategy provides an implicit learning mechanism that guides the selection of offers and which of the sampled offers are sent to the opponent. The different decision mechanisms of the negotiation strategy can be grouped according to the period in which they are applied."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Pre-negotiation: Self-sampling", "text": "If an agent uses complex utility functions to display his preferences, it can be difficult to find custom offers with good value. If the number of questions is not very large, full collection of utility functions can be feasible. However, if the number of questions is large, full collection can be an extremely expensive procedure. For example, a complete capture of a negotiation domain formed by 10 integer questions is inevitable. The costs associated with this capture can be exorbitant, especially if agency preferences are changed at a frequency greater than the time invested in sampling. Furthermore, this capture is unacceptable for AmI domains. Not only does it take too much computing time and power, but there would also have to be too much storage space for the limited devices commonly found in these domains. The sampling process can be reduced by making offers of very low quality for the agent to jump over."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Negotiation: Concession strategy", "text": "A concession strategy defines the benefits the agent seeks to achieve at each negotiation step. Normally, the agent proposes offers that have a benefit equal to or greater than the benefit defined by his concession strategy at a given negotiation round. In this work, we assume a time-dependent strategy in which the benefit each agent needs depends on the remaining negotiation time. Some examples of concession strategies are sit-and-wait [1] (no concessions until the deadline, e.g. one of the agents has a monopoly), linear (same concession rate at each step), boulware [5, 29] (no concession strategies are sit-and-wait [1] (no concessions until the deadline, e.g. one of the agents has a monopoly position), linear (same concession rate at each step), boulware [5, 29] (no concessions until the last rounds, at which they quickly conceal the reserve value at the beginning), and 5 and 29."}, {"heading": "3.2.3. Negotiation: Acceptance criteria", "text": "Acceptance criteria for an intermediary generally depend on his concession strategy. Normally, an offer made by the opponent is accepted if it offers a benefit equal to or greater than the required benefit for the next round of negotiations. Consequently, the acceptance criteria for the intermediary a may be formalised as follows in view of the amount of offers received by the intermediary a from the intermediary b at the time t: Acceptance (X t b \u2192 a) = Acceptance Va (x t, best b \u2192 a) \u2265 Ua (t + 1) otherwise (4), with Acceptance (X t b \u2192 a) being the acceptance function, Evaluation of Va (x) the usefulness of an offer, xt, bestb \u2192 a the best offer received by the opponent in the next round of negotiations, and Ua (t + 1) the benefit required for the next round of negotiations."}, {"heading": "3.2.4. Negotiation: Evolutionary sampling", "text": "This provides an implicit mechanism for learning the opponent's preferences and generating intelligent sampling. Essentially, it is based on the application of some genetic operators to offers received by the opponent in the last round of negotiations, and on P. \"s own good offers. The idea behind evolutionary sampling is that offers generated by this method contain genetic material from the opponent and his own agent. Therefore, these offers may result in a higher likelihood of being accepted by the opponent who has been blindly stomped. The new offers are added to a special population containing offers generated by genetic operators. Consider Xtb \u2192 a = [x t], x t, 2 b \u2192 a, x t, k \u2192 a], this is the set of offers sent from agent to agent, and U (t) the current desired benefit to generate offers in negotiation rounds."}, {"heading": "3.2.5. Negotiation: Select which offers to send", "text": "The next step in defining the negotiating strategy is to define the mechanism for proposing new offers."}, {"heading": "3.2.6. Case Study", "text": "It should be noted that the purpose of this case study is not to test the performance of the model used by Ito et al. [13] to represent the utility functions of the buyer and seller; the weighted utility model was introduced as a complex utility function to model agent preferences; let us consider a negotiation model in which the number of issues N, si representing the i-th issue has a domain si [0, X] that determines its maximum and minimum value, and ~ s = (s2, sN) represents a specific offer."}, {"heading": "4. Experiments", "text": "The proposed negotiation model was tested against the weighted constraint model proposed by Ito et al. [13], which enables full interdependence relations between the negotiation problems to be displayed. Furthermore, if the number of constraints is large, it can represent highly non-linear utility functions and therefore constitutes a suitable test bed for the proposed strategy. Nevertheless, as in the work of Lai et al. [20], the proposed negotiation model is general and does not depend on a particular utility function. Ito et al. \"s model was chosen as a test platform because it provides a well-studied utility function [13, 22, 23] which is sufficiently complex to study the real performance of the negotiation model.First, the negotiation environment used in the experiments is briefly described, then the various experiments and their results are presented, and finally, a brief discussion summarizing the results of the experiments is included."}, {"heading": "4.1. Negotiation setting", "text": "The aim of these experiments was to evaluate whether the proposed model is capable of working in areas where the functionality of the agents is highly non-linear. To this end, various bargaining cases were randomly created: \u2022 Number of problems N = [4-7]. \u2022 Integer problems. \u2022 Si [0, 9]. \u2022 L = N * 5 evenly distributed constraints per agent. \u2022 There are constraints for any interdependence condition that is randomly drawn from [0, 100 and n]. \u2022 For each constraint, the width of the constraints is for each subject, 5 trinity constraints and 5 quaternary constraints per agent. \u2022 V (cl,.) for each n-ary constraint that is randomly drawn from [0, 100 and n]. \u2022 For each constraint, the constraint, the width of the constraints for each problem is si uniformable from [2, 4]."}, {"heading": "4.2. Results", "text": "The proposed strategy, referred to as Evolutionary Sampling or ES, has been compared with two different negotiation models, the first being the implementation of the general framework proposed by Lai et al. [20], which has the entire sample of the use function so that it can fully calculate iso-usage curves, and is used as a measure of how close the proposed strategy is to the ideal case in which all offers are available; the second model assumes that it is not possible to fully test all offers; therefore, it uses a nicking GA (self-sampling) prior to the negotiation process and uses the similarity heuristically (ppevo = 0) during the negotiation process, which is referred to as the Non-Evolutionary Sampling or NES model. The number of samples examined by the NES model prior to the negotiation process is determined as a pamplesevo model with the number of samples examined by the ES model."}, {"heading": "4.2.1. Experiment 1: Performance study on the number of issues", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "4.2.3. Experiment 3: Performance study on k", "text": "The next experiment aims to investigate the performance of the three different models (Lai et al., NES and ES), as the limit on the number of bids sent per round is increased. As mentioned above, the number of bids sent can help to achieve agreements more quickly, as agents are able to find win-win situations, which is very important in AmI environments where the devices have limited performance and their runtime needs to be optimized. Lai et al. [20] showed how higher values of k have helped to achieve better matches. In this scenario, the experiment is repeated to assess whether the differences between the three models are still relevant to different values of k. The values studied were 1, 3, 5 and 7. The rest of the negotiation setting was configured to use negotiation cases with N = 6 topics. Self-sample parameters were applied to the values of NES used in the previous tests."}, {"heading": "4.2.4. Experiment 4: Performance study on |P | and memory performance", "text": "This last experiment was designed to evaluate the impact of the population through the self-sample on the performance of the ES model and the NES model. It is particularly relevant to see how many samples the NES model needs to achieve similar results achieved by the model in this article. Obviously, more population means more memory and more computing costs as there are more samples.The average number of samples was analyzed for a negotiation setting, in the N = 6 and k = 3. Settings for the self-sample and the ES in previous experiments were repeated to increase the number of sampled offers by giving more offers to be optimized in the self-sample."}, {"heading": "4.2.5. Experiment 5: Time Performance", "text": "Thus, the proposed model was implemented with an HTC (1 Ghz, 576 MB RAM, Android Operating System) as one of the parties and a PC (2 Ghz, 4096MB RAM, Ubuntu Operating System) as the other party. Self-sampling parameters were set to nmax = 100, pdc = 80% and pcr = 80%. The number of samples optimized before the negotiation process was set to | P | = 128. As for the parameters used during the negotiation process, these were set to k = 3, M = 5, ncross = 4, pcr = 30% and ppevo = 100%. The number of attributes of the negotiation process was N = 5. The time spent during the entire negotiation process (tt), the time spent sending / waiting for quotations."}, {"heading": "4.3. Discussion", "text": "Ambient Intelligence domains are characterized as domains where computing resources are of extreme importance. Users interact with their environment through devices with limited capabilities, so the efficient use of resources is critical. In addition, environmental infrastructures are usually connected by a limited bandwidth of wireless connection. Therefore, network resources also need to be optimized. The results achieved by the proposed model, while maintaining relatively good economic performance, overcome the problems found in NES environments. However, if we assume that limited devices cannot fully scan the functionality of the agent and store these samples, some mechanisms are needed to collect as few quotes as possible. A simple method would scan scan some quotes before the negotiation process begins, which is exactly what the NES model does."}, {"heading": "5.

personalized services and easier ways of interaction between people and systems. Since several users and systems may coexist in these environments, it is quite possible that entities with opposing preferences need to cooperate to reach their respective goals. Automated negotiation is pointed as one of the mechanisms that may provide a solution to this kind of problems. In this article, a multi-issue bilateral bargaining model for Ambient Intelligence domains is presented where it is assumed that agents have computational bounded resources and do not know their opponents\u2019 preferences. The main goal of this work is to provide negotiation models that obtain efficient agreements while maintaining the computational cost low. A niching genetic algorithm is used before the negotiation process to sample one\u2019s own utility function (self-sampling). During the negotiation process, genetic operators are applied over the opponent\u2019s and one\u2019s own offers in order to sample new offers that are interesting for both parties. Results show that the proposed model is capable of outperforming similarity heuristics which only sample before the negotiation process and of obtaining similar results to similarity heuristics which have access to all of the possible offers.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
