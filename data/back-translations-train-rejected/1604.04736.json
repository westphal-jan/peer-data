Unlike bilateral negotiation between two individuals, this type of negotiations entails to adopt an intra-team strategy for negotiation teams in order to make team decisions and accordingly negotiate with the opponent. It is crucial to be able to negotiate successfully with heterogeneous opponents since opponents' negotiation strategy and behavior may vary in an open environment. While one opponent might collaborate and concede over time, another may not be inclined to concede. This paper analyzes the performance of recently proposed intra-team strategies for negotiation teams against different categories of opponents: competitors, matchers, and conceders. Furthermore, it provides an extension of the negotiation tool Genius for negotiation teams in bilateral settings. Consequently, this work facilitates research in negotiation teams.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Apr 2016 12:11:02 GMT  (510kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04736v1", "Novel Insights in Agent-based Complex Automated Negotiation, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Novel Insights in Agent-based Complex Automated Negotiation, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["victor sanchez-anguix", "reyhan aydogan", "vicente julian", "catholijn jonker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04736"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.04736.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Intra-Team Strategies for Teams Negotiating Against Competitor, Matchers, and Conceders", "authors": ["Victor Sanchez-Anguix", "Reyhan Aydo\u011fan", "Vicente Julian", "Catholijn M.

This type of party participates in many real-life situations, such as negotiations between a spouse and a house vendor, where negotiations have to be conducted between two or more organizations. Although they act as lone warriors, most of the negotiating teams cannot be considered lone warriors. It is a fact that team members have different and conflicting preferences, which must be addressed when making a team decision."}, {"heading": "2 General Framework", "text": "In our framework, a negotiating team is involved in a negotiation with an opponent. Regardless of whether the other party is also a team or not, both parties interact with each other using the protocol of alternating bids. Team dynamics or team-internal strategies define what decisions must be made by a negotiating team, how these decisions are made and when these decisions are made. In a bilateral negotiation between a team and an opponent, the decisions that must be made are what offers are sent to the opponent and whether the opponent's offers are accepted or not. A general view of our framework is presented in Fig. 1. Dashes describe communication within the team, while others represent communication with the opponent. A team A is formed by a team mediator and team members ai. The team mediator communicates with the other party who follows the alternating bids, protocol and team members communicate with the team mediator. Communication between the team and the opponent is conducted by the team mediator as a mediator."}, {"heading": "3 Intra-team strategies", "text": "In this section, we briefly describe the internal team strategies proposed by SanchezAnguix et al. [24,23], which are the focus of our study. These internal team strategies were selected according to the minimum level of unanimity that they can guarantee for each team decision: no guaranteed unanimity (representative), majority / plurality (simple voting with similarity), semi-unanimity (voting with similarity Borda) and unanimity (complete mediated unanimity)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Representative (RE)", "text": "In principle, one of the team members is selected as a representative and acts on behalf of the team. Interactions between team members are non-existent, and therefore each decision is made by the representative according to his or her own criterion. Obviously, the performance of the team is determined by the similarity between the support functions of the team members and the negotiating skills of the representative. It is expected that if the support functions of the team members are very similar and the representative negotiating strategy is appropriate, the team performance is reasonably good. The mechanism the team uses to select its representative may vary by domain: trust, past experience, rational coordination based on who is more similar to themselves, etc. Since Genius is a general simulation framework, a random team member is selected as a representative. This random team member receives the messages of the opponent and acts accordingly by submitting an offer / counter offer or accepting the opponent's offer, etc. Since Genius is a general simulation framework, a team member is randomly selected as a representative who can act as you know."}, {"heading": "3.2 Similarity Simple Voting (SSV)", "text": "The similarity of simple coordination within the team strategy relies on coordination processes to decide which offer is proposed and whether or not the opponent's offer is accepted. Since the strategy is based on coordination, the action of the team members and team coordination through a mediator is required. The team strategy goes as follows: - Acceptance / rejection of the opponent's offer: The team mediator receives an offer from the other side. Then the mediator transfers this offer to the team members, indicating that it comes from the opposing party. The team mediator initiates a voting process whereby each team member should respond to the mediator's offer with an acceptance or rejection, depending on the acceptance of the offer from the team member's point of view. The team mediator collects the responses from each team member and applies a majority rule. If the number of acceptance actions received by team members is greater than half the size of the team, the offer is accepted and the corresponding acceptance action is sent to the opponent."}, {"heading": "3.3 Similarity Borda Voting (SBV)", "text": "This internal team strategy seeks to ensure a higher degree of unanimity by incorporating voting mechanisms that select generally accepted candidates such as the Borda count [19] and unanimity processes. As SSV, the internal team strategy proceeds with the following differences: - Acceptance / rejection of the opponent's offer: Instead of deciding by majority vote whether or not to accept the opponent's offer, the team mediator opens a unanimous vote. Therefore, an opposing offer is accepted if and only if the number of acceptance actions equals the number of team members. Otherwise, the team mediator evaluates the offer mechanism with stars. - Offer Proposal: Each team member may propose an offer sent in accordance with the same mechanisms described in the SSV. Then the team mediator will have the team members evaluate each proposal privately through a Borda count. The team members will give each offer a different score from the team mediator's respective offer, whereby the number of proposals is equal to the A | 1."}, {"heading": "3.4 Full Unanimity Mediated (FUM)", "text": "The question of whether this is a political project, which is not just a political project, but also a political project, which is about putting the interests of the people at the centre, and a project which is about putting the interests of the people at the centre, the question of whether this is a political project which is not just a political project, but also a project which is about putting the interests of the people at the centre, putting the interests of the people at the centre, putting the interests of the people at the centre, putting the interests of the people at the centre, putting the interests of the people at the centre, putting the interests of the people at the centre, putting the interests of the people at the centre, putting the interests of the people at the centre, the interests of the people at the centre, the interests of the people are at the centre, the interests of the people are at the centre."}, {"heading": "4 Implementation in Genius", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments and Results", "text": "As explained in Section 1, one of the purposes of this paper is to evaluate the performance of team strategies against negotiation strategies that differ from classic time-based tactics.

According to our analysis, the team's internal strategies such as Full Unanimity Mediated (FUM), Similarity Borda Voting (SBV), Simple Similarity Voting (SSV) and Representative (RE) are capable of negotiating with varying degrees of success against different types of heterogeneous adversaries. We found similar results for the average benefit of team members in the final agreement and the common benefit of both parties. In the case of the conceders, FUM, SBV and SSV, the best options appear to be as long as they wait for the opponent to make concessions and take advantage of concessions. In the case of the matchers, using either FUM or RE, the negotiating strategy of Agent K seems to be the best decisions. This indicates that for certain types of adversaries a representative approach can be exploited with an appropriate negotiating strategy."}, {"heading": "8 Acknowledgments", "text": "Part of this research is supported by TIN2011-27652-C03-01 and TIN201236586-C03-01 of the Spanish Government.

Unlike bilateral negotiation between two individuals, this type of negotiations entails to adopt an intra-team strategy for negotiation teams in order to make team decisions and accordingly negotiate with the opponent. It is crucial to be able to negotiate successfully with heterogeneous opponents since opponents\u2019 negotiation strategy and behavior may vary in an open environment. While one opponent might collaborate and concede over time, another may not be inclined to concede. This paper analyzes the performance of recently proposed intra-team strategies for negotiation teams against different categories of opponents: competitors, matchers, and conceders. Furthermore, it provides an extension of the negotiation tool Genius for negotiation teams in bilateral settings. Consequently, this work facilitates research in negotiation teams.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
