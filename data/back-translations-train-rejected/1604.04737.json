We acknowledge that the other party may be a different team (e.g. organization vs. organization), but the focus of our study in this article, and the type of applications in our mind, involves negotiations between a team and a single agent. For the opposing model, we used well-known strategies in the agent negotiation literature: \u2022 The opponent uses a time-based tactic during the negotiation process. In multiple attributes, time-limited negotiations begin, provided that the agents gradually admit to reaching an agreement is common. This is especially important when the agents do not know the preferences and strategies of other agents, as exploration of the unification space is required to discover possible agreements. A concession strategy typically begins by demanding the maximum striving and, as the negotiation process progresses, the required striving tends to be lowered."}, {"heading": "3. Intra-Team Strategies", "text": "A team strategy defines what decisions a negotiating team has to make, how those decisions are made and when those decisions are made. Considering that a negotiating team consists of more than one person, decisions should take into account the interests of team members. How decisions are made determines the satisfaction level of the team with the final decision. In this article, most team interactions are conducted in team strategies during the negotiation (when). Next, we describe the four team strategies we propose: Representative (RE), Simple Voting (SSV), Similarity Borda Voting (SBV) and Full Unanimity Mediated (FUM). Each strategy is capable of guaranteeing a minimum of unanimity regarding the offer to the opponent, and whether there is a difference between the activity of the team and the activity (no difference between the four main strategies) and the activity between each strategy."}, {"heading": "3.1. Representative (RE)", "text": "The Representative Strategy (RE) is perhaps the simplest internal team strategy. Basically, one of the team members is chosen during the negotiation as a representative for the team. This agent will act on behalf of the team during the negotiation, which means that it is responsible for selecting which offers are addressed to the opponent and whether the opponent's offers are accepted or not. The only communication is that between the representative and the opponent at the top, and therefore this strategy corresponds to a classic bilateral strategy. The Representative Agent negotiates according to his own usefulness function Uare (.), since he does not know the usefulness function of the other participants. The two decisions to be made during the negotiation are which offers are sent to the opponent and whether the opponent's offer is accepted or not."}, {"heading": "3.1.1. Offer proposal", "text": "Since the negotiations are limited in time, the representative applies a time-based concession tactic sare (.) to negotiate with the opponent, based on a team date TA and a concession speed \u03b2A agreed before the start of the negotiations: sare (t) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 RUare) (tTA) 1 \u03b2A (4) The concession strategy defines the level of aspiration (usefulness) required by the agent in a given round. This usefulness is required from the point of view of the representative, and therefore any offer XtA \u2192 op proposed by are at round t must comply with the following condition: Uare (X t A \u2192 op) = sare (5) Since there are a large number of offers that can comply with the above equation, we have endeavoured to satisfy the preferences of the opponent as far as possible."}, {"heading": "3.1.2. Offer acceptance", "text": "A common acceptance criterion in time-limited negotiations is that an opponent's offer is accepted if he declares a benefit greater than or equal to the benefit to be claimed in the next stage of the negotiation. In the case of the representative, he accepts the offer of the opponent Xtop \u2192 A in round t if he declares a benefit Uare (X t op \u2192 A) greater or equal to sare (t + 1). This can be formalized as follows: Medicare (X t op \u2192 A) = {accept if sare (t + 1) \u2264 Uare (Xtop \u2192 A) reject anything else (7)."}, {"heading": "3.1.3. Unanimity Level", "text": "It is clear that the representative, since he negotiates according to his own usefulness function and reservation function, cannot guarantee unanimity on team decisions. Decisions made by the representative are acceptable to himself (1 agent), but nothing can be guaranteed about the rest of the team members. One might think that if unanimity cannot be guaranteed, this strategy is not worth applying. However, if team members are very similar, this strategy is expected to produce acceptable results with communication costs that correspond to a bilateral negotiation process."}, {"heading": "3.2. Similarity Simple Voting (SSV)", "text": "The second strategy within the team is based on a trusted mediator who helps the team members participate in the negotiation process. His main tasks include coordinating the coordination process and communicating with the opponent. It should be noted that the mediator communicates the team's decisions to the opponent and communicates the opponent's decisions among the team members. Thus, the fact that each team member participates in the negotiation process remains unknown to the opponent. As far as communication within the team is concerned, it should be noted that the team members do not communicate with each other, but only communicate anonymously with the mediator. The voting process decision rule is plurality / majority. More specifically, a plurality rule is applied in the coordination process to decide which offer is sent to the opponent, and a majority rule is applied in the coordination process to decide the adoption of the opponent. A detailed view of the strategy within the team can be observed in Algorithm 1, which describes the entire process from the mediator's point of view."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Offer proposal", "text": "If a new bid must be proposed to the opponent in round t, the Agent will open a call for proposals among the team members.

(1) Then, each agent will anonymously submit a multi-vote bid to the Agent. (1) The multi-vote will collect votes for each bid that is made public. We will use the note V oteai (j) to designate the vote given by the Agent to XTt's bid j-th, and XT t, as the bid in XT-t. The votes may be either positive (1) if the bid j-th is acceptable for the round t, or negative (0) if the bid j-th is not acceptable for the round."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Offer acceptance", "text": "If the facilitator receives an offer from the opponent, the offer will be accepted by the team members (1 for acceptance, 0 for rejection), the facilitator will count the number of acceptances, and if the offer is supported by the majority, it will be accepted by the team. Otherwise, the offer will be rejected. If the number of team members is equal and a tie has been established, a random decision will be made by the mediator. This mechanism can be described as acA (X t op \u2192 A) - if the offer is accepted, it will be rejected by the team. (X t) - If the number of team members is equal and a tie has been established, an accidental decision will be made by the mediator. - This mechanism can be described as acA (X t op \u2192 A) - if it is accepted."}, {"heading": "3.2.3. Unanimity Level", "text": "The proposed method is capable of guaranteeing team decisions supported by a majority of participants. Specifically, plurality is guaranteed in the case of the bid submitted to the opponent, and the majority is assured in the decision on the acceptance of the opponent's bid. Exceptions to this minimum level of unanimity in the team are draws. The most extreme case is, for example, when team members submit offers to the team but only support their own offers. In this case, each proposal adds up to exactly one positive vote and there is no clear majority winner."}, {"heading": "3.3. Similarity Borda Voting (SBV)", "text": "The SBV is capable of ensuring majority and majority decisions within the team. However, some scenarios may require in-team strategies that ensure a higher degree of unanimity. SBV and FUM (later described) are designed to solve this problem. SBV's basic structure remains the same as the SSV, but the voting rules applied are different. Specifically, when each team member votes on team proposals, the Borda count is used to determine the winner, and a unanimity rule is used to determine the opponent's bid acceptance. Next, we briefly describe the aspects that distinguish the SBV from the SSV."}, {"heading": "3.3.1. Offer proposal", "text": "As with SSV, when the team has to submit an offer to the opponent, the mediator opens a call for proposals in which each team member can submit an offer to the mediator. Once each offer has been solicited, the mediator publishes the offers submitted to the team members and a coordination process begins. The main difference between the two team strategies is that team members vote according to a Borda counting rule [27]. Basically, each team member ai ranks the proposals XTt in ascending order according to their own upkeep function Uai (.) We call rankai (XTt) the ascending rank according to the upkeep function ai and position (X, rankai (XTt) as the position (1 to | XT t t t |) that occupies the offer X in a leaderboard. The vote cast by ai for the offer j-th in XTt is the position occupied in the leaderboard minus one unit: V oteai (j) = (XT) position X (sum), which is occupied by the same number of members (XT)."}, {"heading": "3.3.2. Offer acceptance", "text": "The opponent's offer will only be accepted if it is acceptable to all team members. Therefore, the acai (X t op \u2192 A) reasoning used by team members to determine whether an offer is acceptable in turn t corresponds to the one used in the SSV. Thus, the mechanism for accepting an offer can be formalized as follows: acA (X t op \u2192 A) = {accept if it is rejected in turn t op \u2192 A acai (X t op \u2192 A) = | A | otherwise (16)."}, {"heading": "3.3.3. Unanimity Level", "text": "In describing the minimum level of unanimity guaranteed by the SBV, we mentioned the concept of semi-unanimity. It is clear that if an opposing bid is accepted by the team, it is acceptable to each team member by virtue of the unanimity rule adopted. However, such unanimity is not guaranteed with regard to the team decision on which the offer is submitted to the opponent. Borda counting is generally referred to as a method that selects generally accepted options as winners instead of the majority / plurality option (e.g. avoiding the tyranny of the majority). In this sense, Borda counting entails a certain degree of unanimity. Nevertheless, the specific degree of unanimity guaranteed by Borda is difficult to determine in our negotiating scenario."}, {"heading": "3.4. Full Unanimity Mediated (FUM)", "text": "The final team strategy, Full Disagreement Mediated (FUM), seeks unanimity in all team decisions. In fact, every team decision (i.e. bid acceptance, offer proposal) that follows this team strategy is associated with unanimity in each round of the negotiation process. However, the type of mediator required for FUM is more differentiated than the rest of the strategies presented in this article. It requires the mediator to participate in a pre-negotiation process in which team members hand over decision rights over attributes that are not of interest to them. In addition, the team mediator must be able to derive the meaning of attributes for the opponent. Finally, he must also coordinate unanimity coordination processes and a repeated build process that constructs the bids submitted to the opponent. A complete view of the pseudo-algorithm executed by the mediator can be observed in Algorithm 2."}, {"heading": "3.4.1.

Negotiation: observing opponent\u2019s concessions and building an attribute agenda", "text": "When negotiations begin, the mediator tries to guess a ranking of attributes according to the preferences of the opponent, which is used to build an agenda of attributes used in the iterated bidding process. The idea behind the agenda is to satisfy the team members as much as possible with those attributes that are less important to the opponent. In this way, the team members can achieve their desired level of aspiration with those attributes that are less interesting to the opponent, and use the rest of the attributes to satisfy the offer to the opponent in such a way that the only information available regarding the opponent's preferences is the offers received. Thus, the mediator must derive a ranking of attributes based on this information. A possible heuristic assumes that the agents in important attributes usually make less important attributes and greater concessions."}, {"heading": "3.4.3. Negotiation: Offer proposal", "text": "In order to determine what offer the opponent has made, the mediator must take a series of measures to achieve his objectives, the aim of which is to build an offer whose attributes are considered insufficient for the opponent.

The second attribute is to answer the question whether the attributes are less important for the opponent. (...)

Negotiation: Offer acceptance", "text": "Since this strategy strives for unanimity in team decisions, we have used the same mechanism used in the SBV to determine whether an opponent's offer is acceptable or not. If the mediator receives the opponent's offer Xtop \u2192 A, the offer will be publicly disclosed to all team members. Subsequently, the mediator will initiate a private voting process in which each team member ai should indicate whether or not it supports the acceptance of the opponent's offer acai (X t op \u2192 A). The mediator will count the number of positive votes. The offer will be accepted if the number of positive votes matches the number of team members. Otherwise, the offer will be rejected. Similar to the SBV, an opposing offer for a team member in round t is acceptable if it reports a benefit that is greater or equal to the level of aspiration marked by the concession strategy in the next round: acai (X t op \u2192 A) = {true if sai (t + 1) \u2264 Uai (Xai \u2192 A) is the opposite of the respective strategy, which means that the other strategy supports the wrong one."}, {"heading": "3.4.5. Unanimity Level", "text": "As stated in the introduction to this section, this strategy is capable of guaranteeing unanimity in team decisions. It is clear how unanimity is guaranteed in the bid phase, since a voting procedure with a unanimity rule is applied. In [33] we have shown how unanimity is also guaranteed in the bid submitted to the opponent. Specifically, the strategy is able to guarantee strict unanimity: for each team member ai, a utility greater or equal to his or her level of eligibility is reported in the bid sent to the opponent. This is possible thanks to the repeated construction process and assumptions in the service functions of the team members. Since team members share the same type of monotonous evaluation functions, the use of the operator max / min (max for monotonous increasing evaluation functions, min for monotonous decreasing functions) ensures that each attribute for each team member receives a value equal to that is either the one requested for, or greater for the attribute requested."}, {"heading": "4. Experimental Analysis", "text": "In this section, we will examine how the four team-internal strategies presented in this article develop under different environmental conditions.

Negotiation Case: Group Booking", "text": "In this scenario, a group of friends who have decided to spend their holidays together have booked an accommodation for their stay. Their destination is Rome, and they want to spend a whole week. Each friend is represented by their electronic agent, who acts semi-automatically on behalf of their user. This agent has previously elicited the preferences of his user regarding the booking conditions. Each group member has different preferences regarding possible booking conditions, so the final agreement with the hotel should satisfy as much as possible. The group of agents engages in negotiations with a well-known hotel, which is also represented by an electronic agent, has different preferences regarding the booking conditions."}, {"heading": "4.2. Negotiation Environment Conditions & Team Performance", "text": "We believe that the negotiating environment plays a very important role in team dynamics. As the conditions of the negotiating environment vary greatly depending on the scope of application, we have chosen to focus on the general conditions that exist in almost every negotiating scenario with negotiating teams: opponent appointment, team appointment, team preferences similarity, opponent concession speed and team size. In terms of team performance, it is also acknowledged that there are several well-known social measures to assess the quality of decisions in a society. A negotiating team can be considered a small company, and therefore social welfare measures can also be considered as appropriate measures to measure the performance of negotiating teams. More specifically, we examine the impact of the negotiating environment on the minimal benefit of team members (i.e. egalitarian social welfare [4]), and the average benefit of team members (i.e. a weighted case by case and not just weighted social case analysis)."}, {"heading": "4.2.1.

Environment Condition: Team Deadline Length", "text": "Likewise, the maximum number of rounds the team has to complete can also influence the performance of the various internal team strategies.

Dissimilarity between two team members can be measured as follows: D (Uai (.), Uaj (.) = [0,1] n Environmental Impact Tests (X) \u2212 Uaj (X) | X (0, 1] n | (24) If the dissimilarity between two team members is to be accurately measured, it must scan scan all possible offers.

Environment Condition: Opponent Concession Speed", "text": "The concession speed of the opponent during the negotiation process \u03b2op can determine the final quality of the agreement for the team members. If, for example, the opponent makes concessions very quickly vis-\u00e0-vis his reservation benefit, better agreements can be reached for the team earlier in the negotiation process. In these cases, even team-internal strategies that guarantee a lower degree of unanimity can achieve good results. We divided the family of concession speeds on the basis of the classical classification of time tactics: We considered that for \u03b2op = U [0,49] = V B the concession speed is very boulware, if \u03b2op = U [0,5, 0,99] = B the concession speed is boulware, if \u03b2op = U [1, 10] = C the concession speed is concessional, if \u03b2op = U [11, 40] = V C the concession speed is very concession-like.

Environment Condition: Number of Team Members", "text": "We believe that the number of team members can also affect the performance of the various strategies within the team. Some strategies can become too demanding as the number of team members increases and further negotiations can lead to failure. Therefore, we have decided to investigate the impact of team size on the performance of the different strategies within the team. The number of team members ranged from 4 to 8. This number of team members is motivated by the negotiation case used in our experiments. We believe that groups of friends of 4 to 8 people are reasonable in practice."}, {"heading": "4.2.6. Team Performance: Number of Negotiation Rounds", "text": "The number of negotiating rounds takes into account the number of interactions between the team and the opponent.

So, instead of commenting on the results for the number of negotiating rounds in each experiment section, we decided to represent the performance of the four intrateam strategies according to the number of negotiating rounds only once. As an example of this behavior, we can observe the number of negotiating rounds issued by each intra-team strategy if team and opponent have a long time limit (Top = L and TA = L), the number of Team | A members is set at 4, and the opponent uses various concession speeds \u03b2op in Table 2. As long as the concession speed of the four intra-team strategies can be categorized as the same type, RE is usually the fastest intra-team strategy in the negotiation round, followed by SSV, then SBV, and finally FUM alimity is guaranteed among team members, it is logical that Theremay can be found less conflict with the opponent and thus faster."}, {"heading": "4.3.2.

dynamics) for agent-based negotiation teams that negotiate with an opponent. An agent-based negotiation team is a group of agents that joins together as a party because they share common interests in the negotiation at hand. It is experimentally shown how negotiation environment conditions like the deadline of both parties, the concession speed of the opponent, similarity among team members, and team size affect performance metrics like the minimum utility of team members, the average utility of team members, and the number of negotiation rounds. Our goal is identifying which intra-team strategies work better in different environmental conditions in order to provide useful knowledge for team members to select appropriate intra-team strategies according to environmental conditions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
