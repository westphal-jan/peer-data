Bio-inspired algorithms like Genetic Algorithms and Fuzzy Inference Systems are nowadays adopted as hybrids techniques in the commercial and industrial environment. In this paper, we present an interesting application of the FUZZY-GA paradigm to Smart Grids. In particular, this study focuses on the possibility of tuning a Fuzzy Rule Base trying to discover, by means of a GA, a minimal fuzzy rules set in a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) adopted to perform decision making for the power flow management task in a microgrid. The RB optimization is obtained through Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm, based on an encoding scheme inspired by Nature, applied to the optimization of the FIS parameters. Tests show how the proposed controller scheme is effective in maximizing the economic return when dealing with the problem of power flows management in a microgrid, equipped with an energy storage system.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Apr 2016 19:38:21 GMT  (3733kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04789v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 12:17:24 GMT  (4148kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04789v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 04:57:14 GMT  (3291kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04789v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["enrico de santis", "antonello rizzi", "alireza sadeghian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04789"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.04789.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Hierarchical Genetic Optimization of a Fuzzy Logic System for Flow Control in Micro Grids", "authors": ["Enrico De Santis", "Antonello Rizzi", "Alireza Sadeghian"], "emails": ["enrico.desantis@uniroma1.it", "antonello.rizzi@uniroma1.it", "asadeghi@ryerson.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Microgrid, Energy Management System, Battery Energy Storage, Power Flow Optimization, Storage System Management, Fuzzy Systems, Evolutionary Computation, Hierarchical Genetic Algorithms."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to leave the country without being able to leave it."}, {"heading": "2 Related works", "text": "This year, we are in a position to leave the country without having to deal with a country in which it is a country in which it is a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a city, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a city, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a"}, {"heading": "3 Background", "text": "That is why EU member states are able to get their debt under control, \"he told the German Press Agency in Brussels."}, {"heading": "4 Problem Formulation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Model\u2019s assumptions", "text": "The entire control chain in a general microgrid can be considered as a three-tiered system: the field level (data acquisition and decentralized control), the SCADA level (monitoring and control functions) and the planning and management level, which can be a decentralized EMS.

Likewise, we can define the total electrical power demand within the given MG: Dagg (t) = L \u0445 l = 1 Dl (t), (2) where Dl (t) is the amount of electricity effectively consumed by the i-th user within a set of L-consumers, at time sample. The MG is equipped with a BESS, the detailed model of which is provided in Sec. 4,6 below.

Therefore, it is possible to define a generic state of the MG as follows: S (t) = {Bal (t), SOC (t), Cbuy (t), Csell (t)}. (5) The energy balance value (4) defines three different sub-states in which the MG can be found, namely: 1. if Bal (t) < 0, the MG has an energy deficit (under-production state); 2. if Bal (t) = 0, the produced energy meets the internal demand (equilibrium state); 3. if Bal (t) > 0, the MG has an energy surplus (over-production state).

In order to use a more realistic model of the MG, the BESS model is enriched with physical properties of the batteries currently used in the battery-to-grid application. In fact, the model proposed in the current section is based on a real Li-on battery suitable for grid-connected applications [14, 21, 28, 44]. Today, Li-on batteries are used not only in consumer electronics, but also in smart grids, as energy storage capacity for MGs or in V2G applications. [15, 25, 27] Li-on technology is characterized both by a good power-to-weight ratio (about 150 Wh / kg) and by a high efficiency that exceeds 90%.

Zadeh said, fuzzy logic means \"computing with words.\" [46] Based on these general concepts, researchers in engineering, and especially in control systems, developed the paradigm of fuzzy logic modeling (FLM) to address control problems in complex systems that aim to model the underlying uncertainty [22]. As a basis for the control scheme of the proposed MG model, our previous paper [10] developed a Mamdani-type FLC capable of expressing an approximate reasoning method to control a real system, incorporating insights from human experts [29]."}, {"heading": "5.1 The basic Fuzzy Control Scheme", "text": "In fact, it is as if it were an inescapable but inescapable solution, capable of hiding."}, {"heading": "5.2 Fuzzy Logic Controller optimization: the classic scheme", "text": "Depending on the parameters of an FLC that one decides to tune, we can therefore fulfill various parameter learning schemes. In the first FLC control scheme, i.e. the simpler one, the GA is applied to a method for learning knowledge and partly for learning structures [42]. The basics of the optimization scheme for the proposed control problem, obtained by a standard FLC, are in Figure 6. For each of the three inputs in (21) and for the output, we used three fuzzy labels, while we chose the triangular ones for the shape of the input and output MFs. The form of a general FIS rule with three precursors is: IF x1 IS Ai1 AND x2 IS Ai2 AND x3 IS Ai3THEN y IS Bi with wi.

In other words, based on the adaptive power supply structure generated by the precursors of the fuzzy reasoning, we want to find aminimal rules. Basic FLC operates the conclusion with a maximum set of fuzzy rules encrypted in Fig. 7. In the search process, the number of fuzzy rules is considered as another degree of freedom, and it is possible to improve the performance of the overall mechanism of inference."}, {"heading": "5.3.1 HGA chromosome representation", "text": "The assumed chromosome encoding scheme is based on a mixed binary and real value string [3] in which the real genes encode the MF parameters and the rule weights, while the binary genes as control genes encode the activation of MFs.

As for the weights constraints of the fuzzy rules (w1, w2,.., wK,), each allele may be in [0, 1]. Once we define the constraints, the initial values for each allele can be generated by extracting an evenly distributed random variable within the interval constraints. For the control genes as binary strings, the domain of the random variables is the binary value {0, 1} and the random extraction process assigns the same probability to the two possible values."}, {"heading": "5.3.3 Mixed genetic operators", "text": "This separation greatly simplifies the design process for the genetic operators. It is well known that the crossover operator is an important genetic operator who can effectively exchange and recombine the parametric material of two selected parents. Therefore, the hierarchical scheme allows a semantic separation of the genetic material leading to a mixed crossover operator consisting of a specific simple operator for control genes and a suitable operator for the parametric genes. Therefore, the adopted mixed crossover system is implemented as follows: for the control genes pis it is designed a simple \"intersection\" in which the intersections are drawn from a uniform distribution; \u2022 for the parametric genes it is applied \"convex crossover operator,\" as the following relationships are described: pnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewnewpre2 = 1 (1)"}, {"heading": "6 Experimental Evaluation", "text": "This section reports on several experimental evaluations with the aim of measuring the performance of the fuzzy HGA control system used for the task of energy flow optimization in the proposed MG model.

The basic scheme is presented in Fig. 9. The MG model is equipped with a distributed resources such as a photovoltaic generator (PVGS) and a wind generator (WPGS). The model is equipped with an energy storage capacity of 24 kWh and the control system (EMS) based on fuzzy HGA paradigm, in which a hierarchical evolutionary algorithm (HGA) is responsible for learning the FLC parameters and simultaneously the number of adopted fuzzy rules. The control system manages the energy flow of the MG in input and output to maximize accounting profits, sending control measures depending on: the energy balance, the SOC of the battery and the price signal of energy - see Sec. 4.Experiments are conducted in the real world."}, {"heading": "6.2 Preliminary experiments", "text": "As preliminary experiments, we compare the two battery configurations resumed in Tab. 1 with two scenarios characterized by two different values of mutation rate: \u03c1 = {0.01, 0.1}.

HGA search results within Figure 1 and \u03c1 = 0.01 lead to the MFs shown in Fig. 13, 14 with the following control chromosome sections - see Fig. 5.3.1: Recycle bin (\u03b1) = [1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1]; (29) Recycle bin (\u03b2) = [0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1].

With regard to the fuzzy HGA scheme, we have the same considerations reported in paragraph 6.1. Both systems have the same input data and parameters with respect to the MG model. The number of GA generations is set at a value of 100 and the initial population randomly initialized consists of 40 individuals. The fitness function is the one specified in (14). For the configuration of the energy storage system, both MGs have an accumulator with a capacity of 24 kWh, the configuration of which comprises the configuration shown in Figs. 1. 19 and 20 the time profiles of the battery SOC together with the energy produced and required, the energy sold and acquired, and the purchased computing power and the entire accounting."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "In this context, it has to be said that most of them are people who are unable to help themselves."}, {"heading": "8 Future works", "text": "The results are encouraging and suggest that future developments will be based on both MG modelling and learning. In addition, future developments will include the definition of appropriate measures, such as i) the stress of the battery during charging and discharging processes, ii) the stress of the main network in relation to unwanted rapid changes in the flow of electricity between the MG and the main network. These measures can be considered as additional objectives (which are likely to conflict with the main network, which is based on the gain in prosperity) aimed at controlling both the stress of the main network and that of the main network. A mono target or a muti target scheme of the GA can be assumed taking into account the possibility of adjusting the fuzzy controller in such a way that various behaviours are possible, such as the promotion of car consumption, the reduction of battery stress in the main network. Furthermore, there is an interesting future scenario or muti target scheme that encompasses the overall network coverage."}], "references": [{"title": "Optimal charging strategies for unidirectional vehicle-to-grid using fuzzy uncertainties", "author": ["M.

Inference Systems (FIS) are nowadays widely adopted as hybrid techniques in commercial and industrial environment. In this paper we present an interesting application of the fuzzy-GA paradigm to Smart Grids. The main aim consists in performing decision making for power flow management tasks in the proposed microgrid model equipped by renewable sources and an energy storage system, taking into account the economical profit in energy trading with the main-grid. In particular this study focuses on the application of a Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm (HGA) for tuning the Rule Base (RB) of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), trying to discover a minimal fuzzy rules set in a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) adopted to perform decision making in the microgrid. The HGA rationale focuses on a particular encoding scheme, based on control genes and parametric genes applied to the optimization of the FIS parameters, allowing to perform a reduction in the structural complexity of the RB. This approach will be referred in the following as fuzzy-HGA. Results are compared with a simpler approach based on a classic fuzzy-GA scheme, where both FIS parameters and rule weights are tuned, while the number of fuzzy rules is fixed in advance. Experiments shows how the fuzzy-HGA approach adopted for the synthesis of the proposed controller outperforms the classic fuzzy-GA scheme, increasing the accounting profit by 67% in the considered energy trading problem yielding at the same time a simpler RB. keywords: Microgrid, Energy Management System, Battery Energy Storage, Power Flow Optimization, Storage System Management, Fuzzy Systems, Evolutionary Computation, Hierarchical Genetic Algorithms.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
