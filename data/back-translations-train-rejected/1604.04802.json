For the 2015 EDL task, two new foreign languages were introduced - Spanish and Chinese as well as English - and so the task was renamed Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking (TEDL).

Entities types FAC and LOC were newly introduced in 2015, and the extracted mentions are then linked by their ID to an existing English KB entity. If there is no KB entry for an entity, systems are expected to group all mentions for that entity using a NIL ID. Input consists of a corpus of documents in the three languages and an English KB of entities, each with a name, ID, type, and multiple ratios that allow systems to identify unique entities."}, {"heading": "4 Algorithm", "text": "This section describes our approach to combining both supervised and unsupervised methods.

(2015). The idea is to combine predictions by training a \"meta-classifier\" for weight and combining several models using their confidence values as characteristics. By training on a set of monitored data that differs from that used to form the individual models, it learns how to combine their results into an improved ensemble model. Output of the ensembling system is similar to the output of a single system, but productively aggregates the results from different systems. In a final step after processing, the results that are classified as \"correct\" by the classifier are retained, while the others are removed from the output. The meta-classifier makes a binary decision for each unique output that is presented as a key value pair. For the CSSF task, the key to assembling multiple systems is a query along with a slot type, for example, the lot we define for Obama."}, {"heading": "4.2 Unsupervised Ensembling Approach", "text": "Only 38 of the 70 systems that participated in CSSF 2015 were also involved in 2014, and only 24 of the 34 systems that participated in TEDL 2015 also participated in the 2014 EDL task. Therefore, many KBP systems were new in 2015 and did not have any past training data required for the monitored approach. In fact, some of the new systems are better than the shared systems, for example, the hltcoe system did not participate in the use in 2014, but was also ranked fourth in the 2015 TEDL task (Ji et al., 2015). First, we have these unattended systems with the restricted optimization approach described by Wang et al. (2013) Their approach is specific to the English slot fill task and also relies somewhat on past data to identify certain parameter values. Below, we describe our modifications to their approach so that it can be applied to both KBP tasks in a purely unattended manner.

Most KBP teams submit multiple variations of their system. Before executing the supervised and unsupervised approaches discussed above, we first combine several runs of the same team into one. Of the 38 CSSF systems, we tend to be smaller variations.

To CSSF, this is simple: any list filling that is classified as correct is included in the final output. If monovalent slot fillings are multiple fillings that have been correctly classified for the same query and slot type, we include the filling with the highest meta-classifier trust. In TEDL, for each entity link that is classified as correct, the NIL IDs are resolved system-wide because NIL IDs are unique to each system. We merge NIL clusters system-wide into one when there is at least one common NIL cluster ID. Finally, we enter a new NIL ID for these newly merged clusters."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Results", "text": "This section describes a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate ensemble for both KBP tasks using the algorithm described in the previous section, which compares our complete system with different ablations and previous results, all achieved using the official NIST scorers for the post-competition tasks.

We found that the addition of the unattended ensemble, together with the shared systems, significantly increases recall and highlights the importance of using systems that do not have historical training data.As discussed in Section 5, two new auxiliary stacking functions for filling slots based on provenance similarity with the query document and document similarity between systems were improved."}, {"heading": "8 Acknowledgment", "text": "This research was partially supported by the DARPA DEFT program under AFRL grant FA8750-13-20026 and the MURI ARO grant W911NF-08-10242."}], "references": [{"title": "Bootstrapped self training for knowledge base population", "author": ["Angeli et al.2015] Gabor Angeli", "Victor Zhong", "Danqi Chen", "Arun Chaganty", "Jason Bolton", "Melvin Johnson Premkumar", "Panupong Pasupat", "Sonal Gupta", "Christopher D.
