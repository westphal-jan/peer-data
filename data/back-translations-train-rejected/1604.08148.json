Therefore, we sometimes use \"lust\" for \"tendencies to act\" for convenience.

To us, it sounds clearer than the interpretation given by him. We begin our analysis of the concept of \"tendency to act\" (desire).

As I said, the concept of pleasure is defined as \"desire to do something,\" while, for example, one wishes to scratch (that is, one is best illustrated by examples.

The latter is usually seen in the scenario when a person cannot do anything to reach G while waiting for it to happen. For example, a person as an audience wants Manchester United to score a goal. Our analysis of the terms \"desire\" and \"waiting\" gives the definition of desire as follows: \"When you are waiting for a gift sent by a friend of yours, the desire is\" G (the present arrives) \u2192 stop checking. \"In the case of football games, the desire is\" G \"stop checking and cheering (or the desire to cheer).\" The meaning of \"wait\" can be indicated by the difference between these two circumstances: a) sitting there without a desire - he does not wait, and b) sitting there with a desire - he waits. \"That is, on the semantic level and in this context (one cannot wish bad news).\""}, {"heading": "8 Meaning of \u201cgood\u201d", "text": "When you say that something is good, you are merely expressing that you like it, rather than referring to something objective about it. When you say \"something is good,\" you are tacitly referring to the object (usually the speaker) to which it is good. Again, it is not because it is good that I want it, but vice versa. There is no \"good,\" but people's desire to have it. This is another example of inappropriate linguistic forms being expressed in statements whose superficial grammatical form erroneously hypothesizes non-existent objects of various kinds. Delicious food is delicious just because we have a strong desire to eat it, and not because of \"deliciousness.\" Water is 80 \u00b0 C and refers to a goal of water, while the statement that water is hot refers to one's own desire. The same argument applies to \"beauty.\""}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "In order to determine what an emotion is, we need to find a scientifically defined concept of emotion that corresponds to our everyday concept of emotion. So what we should do is make the everyday concept clear - express it explicitly. Conceptualization is difficult when we try to express knowledge about the everyday, \"healthy\" world. Consequently, existing theories stop at the level of \"semantic primitives,\" which are considered indefinable. In this paper, we have shown how to divide these \"atoms\" into smaller \"particles\"; we show how semantic primitives can be further defined in a formal way."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The author thanks Spencer Nash for the helpful discussion and his suggestion on the strategy of writing essays on such a difficult topic."}], "references": [{"title": "Concept of emotion viewed from a prototype perspective", "author": ["B.

To determine what an emotion is, is a matter of conceptualization; namely, understanding and explicitly encoding the concept of emotion as people use it in everyday life. This is a notoriously difficult problem (Frijda, 1986; Fehr & Russell, 1984). This paper firstly shows why this is a difficult problem by aligning it with the conceptualization of a few other so called semantic primitives such as \u201cEXIST\u201d, \u201cFORCE\u201d, \u201cBIG\u201d (plus \u201cLIMIT\u201d). The definitions of these thought-to-be-indefinable concepts, given in this paper, show what formal definitions of concepts look like and how concepts are constructed. As a by-product, owing to the explicit account of the meaning of \u201cexist\u201d, the famous dispute between Einstein and Bohr is naturally resolved from linguistic point of view. Secondly, defending Frijda\u2019s view that emotion is action tendency (or Ryle\u2019s behavioral disposition (propensity)), we give a list of emotions defined in terms of action tendency. In particular, the definitions of pleasure and the feeling of beauty are presented. Further, we give a formal definition of \u201caction tendency\u201d, from which the concept of \u201cintensity\u201d of emotions (including pleasure) is naturally derived in a formal fashion. The meanings of \u201cwish\u201d, \u201cwait\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d, \u201chot\u201d are analyzed.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
