They are available in several sources like the television guide, best-selling reference books, newspaper columns, and television programs. Furthermore, movie ratings are crucial for recommendation engines that track the behavior of all users and utilize the information to suggest items they might like. Movie ratings in most cases, thus, provide information that might be more important than movie feature-based data. It is intuitively appealing that information about the viewing preferences in movie genres is sufficient for predicting a genre of an unlabeled movie. In order to predict movie genres, we treat ratings as a feature vector, apply the Bernoulli event model to estimate the likelihood of a movies given genre, and evaluate the posterior probability of the genre of a given movie using the Bayes rule. The goal of the proposed technique is to efficiently use the movie ratings for the task of predicting movie genres. In our approach we attempted to answer the question: \"Given the set of users who watched a movie, is it possible to predict the genre of a movie based on its ratings?\" Our simulation results with MovieLens 100k data demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed technique, achieving 59% prediction rate for exact prediction and 69% when including correlated genres.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 25 Mar 2016 08:49:51 GMT  (1242kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08608v1", "5 pages, 8 figues, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 8 figues, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["eric makita", "artem lenskiy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.08608"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.08608.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A movie genre prediction based on Multivariate Bernoulli model and genre correlations", "authors": ["Eric Makita", "Artem Lenskiy"], "emails": ["ericmakita@koreatech.ac.kr,", "lensky@koreatech.ac.kr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, we are able to go in search of a solution that meets the needs of the people."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "One study suggested a film recommendation system that improves accuracy and overcomes the traditional recommendation by factorizing the user genre matrix instead of the user item matrix [10]. The factorized user genre matrix model was used to detect latent factors from the genres in order to enrich user profiles. In [11], content-based filtering was proposed to overcome one of the main problems of recommendation systems, called item cold start. Item cold start refers to new items that have not received enough feedback from users, which could reduce the accuracy of the recommendation. Another example of category-based recommendations is proposed in [12], where authors presented a framework called SEP to overcome problems of the recommendation system such as cold start and thrift. The authors in [13] proposed a recommendation system approach that uses gene purity to address the most important aspects of the recommendation system, but also to use the most important ones."}, {"heading": "III. PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "The proposed method uses the well-known Bernoulli model for calculating the conditional probability that a movie is a particular genre. (To clearly describe our idea, we first give some definitions used in this paper: user set: U, movie set: M, genre set: G, rating set: R.A movie m, 0 otherwise is characterized by a binary feature vector whose components are set to 1 if the corresponding user u rates the movie as r otherwise zero. That is: VM, u (r) = {1 if u Ratedmovie m as r, 0 otherwise. (1) Assuming that the ratings of a user do not depend on the ratings of other users, the conditional probability of a movie, m given genre g, is calculated according to multivarized Bernoulli model as follows: P (m | g) = V, R, E, U, E, U, U, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R"}, {"heading": "IV.

Dataset", "text": "We begin by describing the MovieLens dataset and the parameters used in our experiments. We conducted our experiments with the MovieLens 100K dataset [14], which has 1,682 movies, 943 users and 100,000 ratings in the range of 1 to 5. In this dataset, each user rated at least 20 movies. Here, 18 movie genres were selected and each movie is assigned at least one genre. We conducted the experiment by dividing the dataset into two parts, a training set and a test set. During the training phase, rows of the genre matrix and columns in the rating matrix corresponding to the test set were removed. Therefore, the user preference models were created using only a portion of the available rating elements with known genres selected for the test."}, {"heading": "B.
