To tackle this issue, routing must take into account energy efficiency as well as capacity considerations; moreover, in rapidly-varying network environments, this must be accomplished in a real-time, distributed manner that remains robust in the presence of random disturbances and noise. In view of this, we derive a pricing scheme whose Nash equilibria coincide with the network's socially optimum states, and we propose a distributed learning method based on the Boltzmann distribution of statistical mechanics. Using tools from stochastic calculus, we show that the resulting Boltzmann routing scheme exhibits remarkable convergence properties under uncertainty: specifically, the long-term average of the network's power consumption converges within $\\varepsilon$ of its minimum value in time which is at most $\\tilde O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$, irrespective of the fluctuations' magnitude; additionally, if the network admits a strict, non-mixing optimum state, the algorithm converges to it - again, no matter the noise level. Our analysis is supplemented by extensive numerical simulations which show that Boltzmann routing can lead to a significant decrease in power consumption over basic, shortest-path routing schemes in realistic network conditions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 May 2016 22:55:17 GMT  (557kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01451v1", "24 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["panayotis mertikopoulos", "aris l moustakas", "anna tzanakaki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01451"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.01451.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Boltzmann Meets Nash: Energy-Efficient Routing in Optical Networks under Uncertainty", "authors": ["Panayotis Mertikopoulos", "Anna Tzanakaki"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Motivated by the massive use of power-hungry data centers to provide IT services, we are investigating the problem of optical network routing with the aim of minimizing traffic-related power consumption.

In view of this, we derive a pricing scheme whose Nash equilibria coincide with the network\u2019s socially optimum states, and we propose a distributed learning method based on the Boltzmann distribution of statistical mechanics. Using tools from stochastic calculus, we show that the resulting Boltzmann routing scheme exhibits remarkable convergence properties under uncertainty: specifically, the long-term average of the network\u2019s power consumption converges within \u03b5 of its minimum value in time which is at most \u00d5(1/\u03b52), irrespective of the fluctuations\u2019 magnitude; additionally, if the network admits a strict, non-mixing optimum state, the algorithm converges to it \u2013 again, no matter the noise level.
