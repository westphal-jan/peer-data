Using such data to detect anomalous behaviour is critical for safety and efficient maintenance. However, anomalies occur rarely and with great variety in such systems, so there is often insufficient anomalous data to build reliable detectors. A standard approach to mitigate this problem is to use one class methods relying only on data from normal behaviour. Unfortunately, even these approaches are more likely to fail in the scenario of a dynamical system with manual control input(s). Normal behaviour in response to novel control input(s) might look very different to the learned detector which may be incorrectly detected as anomalous. In this paper, we address this issue by modelling time-series via Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and utilising such an ODE model to simulate the behaviour of dynamical systems under varying control inputs. The available data is then augmented with data generated from the ODE, and the anomaly detector is retrained on this augmented dataset. Experiments demonstrate that ODE-augmented training data allows better coverage of possible control input(s) and results in learning more accurate distinctions between normal and anomalous behaviour in time-series.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 May 2016 09:15:55 GMT  (617kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01534v1", "Published at NIPS Time-series Workshop - 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Published at NIPS Time-series Workshop - 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mohit yadav", "pankaj malhotra", "lovekesh vig", "k sriram", "gautam shroff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01534"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.01534.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "ODE - Augmented Training Improves Anomaly Detection in Sensor Data from Machines", "authors": ["Mohit Yadav", "Pankaj Malhotra", "Lovekesh Vig", "K Sriram", "Gautam Shroff"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is such that we are able to assert ourselves in a position to assert that we are able to establish ourselves in the world, and that we are able to assert ourselves in the world, that we are able to assert ourselves in the world, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in the world, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in the world of freedom, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in the world, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we, in which we live, in which we live, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we live, in which we, in the world, in which we, in which we, in the world, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we live, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in the world, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in the world, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in which we, in"}, {"heading": "2 Proposed Approach", "text": "Consider a multivariate time series X = {x (1), x (2),..., x (n)}, in which each point x (t) \u0445Rm in the time series is a m-dimensional vector of variables / sensors. Time series data resulting from a controlled dynamic system can normally be divided into two groups of variables: Xc is a specified \"control variable\" such as the position of the accelerator (APP) and Xd, the \"dependent\" variables such as coolant temperature (CT), torque, etc. In our application, we observe that the behavior of control variables was often relatively simple (as shown in the upper part of Fig.1), which allows us to model them using statistical distributions and generate synthetic data by scanning these distributions. We learn an ODE model for the dependent variables Xd (expressed as a function of Xc and Xd), from which we can use data to manually generate the Xsynchronized Xd series, Xchron generating the latter one."}, {"heading": "2.1 Learning ODE parameters", "text": "An ODE model for a dependent variable Xd can be presented as in Equation. 1, where Pw (t) corresponds to the parameters (Pw (t) = P 0 w (t), P 1 w (t), P 2 w (t)) of the ODE within a timeframe w (t). The task of learning an ODE model can be divided into two subtasks: 1) estimation of the structure f (Pw (t), Xd (t), Xc (t)))), i.e., the type of interaction between dependent and control variables, and 2) estimation of the parameters Pw (t). For the first subtask, we expect the ODE model of domain knowledge to be available. For example, an ODE structure for modeling coolant temperature (CT) is mentioned in Equation. 1 (where Xd = CT and Xc = APP = APP), and similar models are also used in [11]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Using ODE to Generate Data", "text": "As mentioned in Section 2.1, the behavior of the control variables (Xc = {APP}) is often relatively simple, e.g. the APP operates in two states: \"high\" and \"low,\" as shown in Fig. 1. We learn statistical distributions, i.e. histograms for the duration and level of each state based on available training data, and sample these distributions to generate new manual control inputs. For dependent variable (s) (Xd = {CT}), we integrate numerically the learned ODE model for new control inputs (Xc = {APP}). The ODE parameters are learned for all time series pairs (APP, CT) available in the training, and such a pair is used when generating the data for a new control input (s) (Xc = {APP})."}, {"heading": "2.3 LSTM-AD: LSTM-based Anomaly Detection", "text": "We learn a stacked / deep LSTM prediction model, in which x (t) is used to predict {x (t + 1),..., x (t + l)}, i.e. time series for the next l time steps. An error vector e (t) for the point x (t) is given by e (t) = [e (t) 1, e (t) 2,..., e (t) l], where e (t) i is the difference between enx (t) and its value, as at the time t \u2212 i. The probability that a point x (t) is normal is derived from the probability value of the corresponding error vector e (t), which is calculated from a learned Gaussian probability function over the set of error vectors from the normal data. The parameters of Gaussian distribution are estimated from the maximum likelihood estimation over a set of error vectors, which are calculated from normal time triple points, by calculating the probability of M, by calculating the value of the value of the value of the width of the hex for the threshold of the hex."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments and Results", "text": "We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach based on sensor data coming from a real vehicle-engine application. Two sensors in this dataset are APP and CT, the former being a manual control sensor and the latter a dependent sensor. We inject various types of anomalies in the time series recorded for normal CT operation to obtain data for abnormal behavior [3]. The following types of anomalies have been inserted: 1) sudden occurrence of a zero for a short time, 2) values that are higher / lower than the normal observed range, 3) dependent sensor CT that deviates from the expected behavior, i.e., CT behaves as if the control sensor is low when it was actually high, 4) noise in a randomly selected portion of the time series, and 5) gradual increase in the values of the CT sensor beyond the maximum observed value during normal behavior."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "Insufficient data can pose a challenge to the formation of machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, especially for deep models. In this paper, we use ODE models from domain knowledge to extend time series data from dynamic systems. Extended time series data has proven useful to learn normal behavior more robustly. We argue that the benefits of ODE-enhanced data are based on the fact that they contain sufficient data for the normal behavior of a dynamic system with a larger collection of variations in manual control inputs. In the future, it will be interesting to explore the possibility of a purely data-driven ODE approach [12, 13]."}], "references": [{"title": "Static and dynamic novelty detection methods for jet engine health monitoring", "author": ["P.
