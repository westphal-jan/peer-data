An in-depth investigation of this question has not been previously carried out. Understanding this aspect can contribute to a more efficient selection of candidate sentences which, besides reducing the time required for item writing, can also ensure a higher degree of variability and authenticity. We present a set of relevant aspects collected based on the qualitative analysis of a smaller set of context-dependent corpus example sentences. Furthermore, we implemented a rule-based algorithm using these criteria which achieved an average precision of 0.76 for the identification of different issues related to context dependence. The method has also been evaluated empirically where 80% of the sentences in which our system did not detect context-dependent elements were also considered context-independent by human raters.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 May 2016 07:30:53 GMT  (184kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01845v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ildik\\'o pil\\'an"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01845"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.01845.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["ildiko.pilan@svenska.gu.se"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 5.01 845v 1 [cs.C L] 6M ay"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Extracting individual sentences from corporations using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools can be useful for a number of purposes, including identifying candidate sentences for the automatic generation of exercises. Such sentences are also known as seed sentences (Sumita et al., 2005) or carrier sentences (Smith et al., 2010) in intelligent computerized language teaching (ICALL). Interest in using corpora in language teaching began as early as the 1980s, as the increasing amount of digital texts available enables learning through authentic language usage (O'Keeffe et al., 2007). However, since sentences in a text form constitute a coherent discourse, it may be necessary to interpret certain expressions in a sentence, i.e., a context that is needed to determine a context (O'Keeffe et al., 2011)."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Corpus Examples Combined with NLP for Language Learning", "text": "In a language learning scenario, sample sentences can be useful both as exercise elements and as vocabulary examples. Previous work on creating exercise elements has applied different strategies for selecting carrier sentences. In some cases, sentences are mainly required to include a lexical element or linguistic pattern that is the goal of the exercise, but context dependence is not explicitly addressed (Sumita et al., 2005; Arregik, 2011). Another alternative was the use of dictionary examples as carrier sentences, e.g. from WordNet (Pino and Eskenazi, 2009). Such sentences are inherently context-independent, but represent some limitations on the linguistic aspects to be pursued in the exercises. In Pila \u0301 n et al. (2014) we have presented and compared two algorithms for selecting carrier sentences in Swedish, using both rule-based and machine learning methods."}, {"heading": "2.2 Linguistic Aspects Influencing Context Dependence", "text": "The relationship between sentences in a text can be expressed either explicitly or implicitly, i.e. with or without specific linguistic elements that require extrasentential information (Mitkov, 2014). The explicit forms include words and phrases that imply structural discourse relationships or are anaphorical (Webber et al., 2003). In a text, the way sentences are linked together can have an additional relational meaning in addition to that which we can deduce separately from the content of each sentence. Examples of such elements include structural connectives: conjunctions, conjunctions, and \"paired\" conjunctions (Webber et al., 2003). Another form of reference to aforementioned discourses is anaphora. The phenomenon anaphora consists of a word or phrase (anaphora) that refers to a previously mentioned entity (antecedent). Mitkov (2014) outlines a number of different anaphora functions that are most common based on their location and anaphora."}, {"heading": "3 Datasets", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able, that we are able to hide ourselves, and that we are able, that we will be able, that we will be able, that we will be able, that we will be able."}, {"heading": "4 Methodology", "text": "In fact, most people who see themselves as capable are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they don't want."}, {"heading": "5 Data Analysis Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Qualitative Results Based on Thematic Analysis", "text": "The list of topics collected during our qualitative analysis is long."}, {"heading": "5.2 Quantitative Comparison of Positive and Negative Samples", "text": "In addition to conducting a thematic analysis, we also compared our positive and negative samples based on quantitative linguistic information in search of additional evidence for the topics that arose and to identify other aspects that were potentially worth targeting. Overall, the language frequency count (POS) showed some large differences between CDEP and CINDEP sentences. There was a tendency toward a nominal content in context-dependent sentences, where 21.6% of all POS tags were nouns. However, this value was 9% lower for context-dependent sentences, suggesting a preference for a higher density of concepts in context-dependent sentences. In contrast, pronouns in context-dependent sentences were more common (12.6% overall) than in context-independent sentences (7% less common). Qualitative analysis found that elements responsible for context-dependence often occurred at the beginning of the sentence. Therefore, we compared the three-set of three-quarter sentences to the initial tendency of these two sets, with only a percentage of the three-second groups matching the initial tendency of each of the two."}, {"heading": "6 An Algorithm for the Assessment of Context Dependence", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate until it is able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "7 Performance on the Datasets", "text": "We evaluated our system both on the hand-picked negative examples collected by EVAL1 and EVAL2 (CDEP) and on the positive examples emanating from the good dictionaries (CINDEP-D.)

In the evaluation structure, all implemented topics were used as filters, i.e. sentences that contained a recognised element associated with context dependence were discarded. In addition to context dependence, other selection criteria (e.g. readability) were included in the evaluation system, but for reasons of relevance and space, these aspects and the associated results were not discussed. The selected sentences were given to 5 language teachers who assessed the suitability of these sentences according to 3 criteria: (i) their degree of context independence, (ii) their CE4 and FRi level (in total two sentences were required for their ability to learn)."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "Based on the thematic analysis of a number of context-based sentences, we implemented a rules-based algorithm to automatically assess this aspect, which was evaluated not only on the basis of our data sets, but also with the help of language teachers with very positive results. Approximately 76% of the subjects were correctly identified in context-based sentences, while the number of misalignments in the context-independent data remained rather low. Approximately 80% of the candidate sentences selected with a system that incorporates the presented algorithm were classified as context-dependent in our user-based assessment, and the results also showed a positive correlation between context-independent and overall language learning tendencies. In the future, we plan to investigate the extension of the algorithm to other languages and to experiment with machine learning approaches for this task, including the resources mentioned in this paper."}], "references": [{"title": "Contextindependent and context-dependent information in concepts", "author": ["Lawrence W Barsalou"], "venue": "Memory & Cognition,", "citeRegEx": "Barsalou.,? \\Q1982\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Barsalou.", "year": 1982}, {"title": "Korp-the corpus infrastructure of Spr\u00e5kbanken", "author": ["Borin et al.2012] Lars Borin", "Markus Forsberg", "Johan Roxendal"], "venue": "In Proceedings of LREC,", "citeRegEx": "Borin et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Borin et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "SALDO: a touch of yin to WordNet\u2019s yang", "author": ["Borin et al.2013] Lars Borin", "Markus Forsberg", "Lennart L\u00f6nngren"], "venue": "Language Resources and Evaluation,", "citeRegEx": "Borin et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Borin et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Using thematic analysis in psychology", "author": ["Braun", "Clarke2006] Virginia Braun", "Victoria Clarke"], "venue": "Qualitative research in psychology,", "citeRegEx": "Braun et al\\.,? \\Q2006\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Braun et al\\.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Automatic example sentence extraction for a contemporary German dictionary", "author": ["Lothar Lemnitzer", "Alexander Geyken"], "venue": "In Proceedings EURALEX,", "citeRegEx": "Didakowski et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Didakowski et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Pronouns without explicit antecedents: how do we know when a pronoun is referential.

An in-depth investigation of this question has not been previously carried out. Understanding this aspect can contribute to a more efficient selection of candidate sentences which, besides reducing the time required for item writing, can also ensure a higher degree of variability and authenticity. We present a set of relevant aspects collected based on the qualitative analysis of a smaller set of contextdependent corpus example sentences. Furthermore, we implemented a rule-based algorithm using these criteria which achieved an average precision of 0.76 for the identification of different issues related to context dependence. The method has also been evaluated empirically where 80% of the sentences in which our system did not detect context-dependent elements were also considered context-independent by human raters.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
