For many major user-generated content platforms, less than half the content is in English [7, 8] and many users do not speak English as their native language [5, 6]. However, because Internet penetration rates are already high in most English-speaking countries, future user growth (and the content contributed by those users) will be predominantly in non-English languages [3]. However, the language dynamics of online reviews have received little scientific attention, and industry practices vary widely. Generally, many websites aggregate reviews from multiple languages to calculate an average rating, as is the TripAdvisor travel review website analyzed in this paper. However, many websites differ from how reviews in other languages (if any) are displayed to users."}, {"heading": "Data and methods", "text": "Tourist attractions in popular international cities are rated by users from many countries that speak many languages. TripAdvisor is one of the largest travel review platforms, reporting 315 million unique visitors per month.2 All reviews on tripadvisor.co.uk about tourist attractions in London, England, have been searched and extracted using a bespoke web crawler in Python. 3 London is an appropriate choice as it is a large international city and a top tourist destination for people from many countries. At the time of the crawl in July 2015, TripAdvisor had 516,641 reviews referring to 3,040 different tourist attractions in London. The dataset includes only tourist attractions (as defined by TripAdvisor) and does not include reviews of hotels and restaurants. TripAdvisor provides a link to machine translated non-English reviews, and the source language parameter that was included in that link."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "It's not the first time the star has been linked with a number of high-profile women, with the former TOWIE star recently gushing about her new man in an interview with The Daily Telegraph."}, {"heading": "Discussions", "text": "It is common practice to create an overall rating for a product or item simply by evaluating all available reviews without considering the location or language of the reviewer. In terms of language and tourist attractions in London, this practice generally seems justified, although some language pairs correlate more than others. In general, research has suggested that a greater number of reviews is helpful for a person trying to make a decision about a product. [9] Users can derive some benefit from reviews in languages they do not read and possibly more from the translations of the review text. At the same time, the experience of reviewers who speak a different language is a poor indication of the experience that the person actually has with a product / service."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "I am grateful for financial support in conducting this research from the John Fell Oxford University Press (OUP) Research Fund and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) of the University of Oxford Impact Acceleration Account and Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) and the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) for funding the original collection of TripAdvisor data as part of a project investigating the quality and completeness of web archive data."}], "references": [{"title": "Bilingualism.
