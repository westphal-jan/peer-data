Despite its various successful applications in theoretical computer science, AI, and game theory, the technical development of the field has been mainly focusing on the propositional part, i.e., the propositional modal logics of \"knowing that\". However, knowledge is expressed in everyday life by using various other locutions such as \"knowing whether\", \"knowing what\", \"knowing how\" and so on (knowing-wh hereafter). Such knowledge expressions are better captured in quantified epistemic logic, as was already discussed by Hintikka (1962) and his sequel works at length. This paper aims to draw the attention back again to such a fascinating but largely neglected topic. We first survey what Hintikka and others did in the literature of quantified epistemic logic, and then advocate a new quantifier-free approach to study the epistemic logics of knowing-wh, which we believe can balance expressivity and complexity, and capture the essential reasoning patterns about knowing-wh. We survey our recent line of work on the epistemic logics of \"knowing whether\", \"knowing what\" and \"knowing how\" to demonstrate the use of this new approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 May 2016 16:24:03 GMT  (78kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01995v1", "36 pages, under submission"], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 02:23:48 GMT  (78kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01995v2", "36 pages, to appear in Jaakko Hintikka on knowledge and game theoretical semantics, Springer's Outstanding Contributions to Logic Series"], ["v3", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 08:54:01 GMT  (81kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01995v3", "36 pages, to appear in Jaakko Hintikka on knowledge and game theoretical semantics, Springer's Outstanding Contributions to Logic Series (some references are updated in this version)"]], "COMMENTS": "36 pages, under submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["yanjing wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01995"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.01995.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Yanjing Wang"], "emails": ["y.wang@pku.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 5.01 995v 3 [cs.A I] 2 3N ov"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The epistemic logic as a field was created and largely shaped by Jaakko Hintikka's groundbreaking work.

An example given by Hintikka (2003) is \u201cI know whom every young mother should trust\u201d (with the intention pointing to \u201cher own mother\u201d). It seems that we need to pick up the trusted one in a uniform way for each young mother, and thus \u2203 f K\u2200x(M(x) \u2192 T (x, f (x))) is a faithful formalization. Actually such knowledge of functions is pervasive in empirical sciences, where the research can be viewed as asking Nature what is the (functional) dependence between different variables (Hintikka, 1999). For example, let x be the controlled variable and y be the observed variable, and we ask Nature the dependence between x and y by doing experiments E by changing the value of x. The desideratum of such a question is that I know the dependence between x and y according to the experiments, which can be formalized as \u2203 f K\u2200xE(x, f (x)) where E can be viewed as the relation paring the values of x and y according to the experiments. Like before, merely having K\u2200xE(x,g(x)) is not enough, we do need a conclusiveness condition that you know the function g: \u2203 f K\u2200x( f (x) = g(x)). In this way, Hintikka (1996) managed to explain how mathematical knowledge, such as the knowledge of certain functions, plays a role in empirical research.", "startOffset": 83, "endOffset": 3184}, {"referenceID": 12, "context": "9 How the domain varies may affect the corresponding quantified modal axioms, see (Bra\u00fcner and Ghilardi, 2007) for a overview on this issue in first-order modal logic.", "startOffset": 82, "endOffset": 110}, {"referenceID": 47, "context": "However, the above discussion leads to the introduction of higher-order entities, whose existence is unclear (Hintikka, 2003).", "startOffset": 109, "endOffset": 125}, {"referenceID": 42, "context": "However, the above discussion leads to the introduction of higher-order entities, whose existence is unclear (Hintikka, 2003).

The idea is to introduce the independence sign \u201c/\u201d into the logic language to let some quantifiers jump out of the scopes of earlier ones, in order to have a branching structure of quantifiers which are linearly ordered in the formulas. For example, \u2200x(\u2203y/\u2200x)(x = y) is not valid anymore, compared to \u2200x\u2203y(x = y), since the choice of y is independent from the choice of x. Now the earlier \u201cyoung mother\u201d formula becomes K\u2200x(\u2203y/K)(M(x) \u2192 T (x,y)) without the second-order quantification. Likewise, the desideratum of an experiment can be formalized as K(\u2200x)(\u2203y/K)E(x,y). The slash sign not only works with quantifiers but also logical connectives. For example, K(p(\u2228/K)\u00acp) expresses knowing whether p while K(p\u2228\u00acp) amounts to knowing a tautology. There is also a beautiful correspondence between the desideratum and the presupposition of the same whquestion. The desideratum can usually be obtained by adding a suitable slash in the corresponding presupposition. For example, the presupposition of \u201cWho murdered b?\u201d is that K\u2203xM(x,b), i.e., I know someone murdered b, and the desideratum is K(\u2203x/K)M(x,b) which is equivalent to \u2203xKM(x,b), i.e., I know who murdered b.

However, knowledge is expressed in everyday life by using various other locutions such as \u201cknowing whether\u201d, \u201cknowing what\u201d, \u201cknowing how\u201d and so on (knowing-wh hereafter). Such knowledge expressions are better captured in quantified epistemic logic, as was already discussed by Hintikka (1962) and his sequel works at length. This paper aims to draw the attention back again to such a fascinating but largely neglected topic. We first survey what Hintikka and others did in the literature of quantified epistemic logic, and then advocate a new quantifier-free approach to study the epistemic logics of knowing-wh, which we believe can balance expressivity and complexity, and capture the essential reasoning patterns about knowing-wh. We survey our recent line of work on the epistemic logics of \u2018knowing whether\u201d, \u201cknowing what\u201d and \u201cknowing how\u201d to demonstrate the use of this new approach.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
