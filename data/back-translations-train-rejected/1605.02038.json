Instead of hand-tuning a standard metaheuristic to test the efficiency of the hybrid of the components, we chose to use an automated generation of a multi-component metaheuristic to save human time, and also improve objectivity in the analysis and comparisons of components. For this we designed a new metaheuristic schema which we call Conditional Markov Chain Search (CMCS). We show that CMCS is flexible enough to model several standard metaheuristics; this flexibility is controlled by multiple numeric parameters, and so is convenient for automated generation. We study the configurations revealed by our approach and show that the best of them outperforms the previous state-of-the-art BBQP algorithm by several orders of magnitude.

Note that a climbing component potentially implies either a simple improvement or a repetitive local search procedure with iterated operators that is only terminated when a local maximum is reached.

Conditional Markov Chain Search (CMCS)", "text": "The existing framework that came closest to our needs was the Markov Chain Hyper-Heuristic (MCHH). MCHH is a relatively simple algorithm that applies components in a sequence. This sequence is a Markov chain; the \"state\" in the Markov chain is only the operator to be applied, and so the Markov nature means that the transition to a new state (component / operator) depends only on the carefully applied component and transition probabilities. Transition probabilities organized in a transition matrix are achieved dynamically in MCHH by learning the most successful sequences. While MCHH is a successful approach that is able to use several algorithmic components effectively, it does not necessarily provide the necessary convenience of interpreting individual components and their combinations, because the transition probabilities in MCHH are dynamically altered, and in order to solve this problem, we have decided to have them and the transition matrix."}, {"heading": "11 else", "text": "12 h \u2190 RouletteWheel (M Failh, 1, M Failh, 2,..., M Failh, | H |);"}, {"heading": "13 return S\u2217;", "text": "Developed for BBQP [15, 9], we initialize the search with a randomly generated solution, whereby the probability of xi = 1 and yj = 1 is 50%."}, {"heading": "3.2.

Solution Representation", "text": "We use the most natural solution representation for BBQP, i.e. simple storage of the vectors x and y. However, the additional storage of some auxiliary information together with the solution can dramatically improve the performance of the algorithms. We use a similar strategy as in [11]. In particular, in addition to the vectors x and y, we always maintain ci + \u2211 j yjqij for each i and for each j + \u2211 i xiqij. Maintaining this auxiliary information slows down any updates of the solution, but considerably accelerates the evaluation of potential movements, which usually takes up most of the time during the search."}, {"heading": "5.2. Solution Polishing", "text": "As in many one-point metaheuristics, the switch between diversifying and intensifying steps of the CMCS means that the best-found solution must be stored, and that it does not necessarily represent a local maximum in relation to all available mountaineers. Therefore, we apply a polishing process to every CMCS configuration created in this study, including special cases of VNS, Op. Prob. and MCHH. Our polishing process is performed after the CMCS has completed its work, and it aims to improve the best solution found during the operation of the CMCS. It successively terminates the OptX, OptY, FlpX and FlpY components, and restarts that sequence each time an improvement is found. If none of these algorithms can improve the solution, that is, the solution is a local maximum in relation to all our mountaineers, the process ends."}, {"heading": "5.3.

Evaluation of Metaheuristics", "text": "In Tables 3 and 4, however, we report on their performance on benchmark instances, specifying 10 seconds per medium instance and 100 seconds per large instance. For each instance and metaheuristics, we report on the percentage gap between the solution obtained through this metaheuristics and the best known objective value for that instance. The best objective values are achieved by recording the best solutions produced in all of our experiments, not necessarily just the experiments reported in this paper. The best known solutions are provided for download, and their objective values are provided in Tables 5 and 6. The results of the experiments on benchmark instances are generally positively correlated with the configuration of objective function (3), except that op. sample performance is better than MCHH, and competes with CMCS [2 series reduced] to large instances. This shows a common problem that the evaluation by short runs on small instances is correlated to how the training is always used for the component, which is not perfect."}, {"heading": "6.1. Comparison to the State-of-the-art", "text": "There have been two published high-performance metaheuristics for BBQP: Iterated Local Search by Duarte et al. [9] and Tabu Search by Glover et al. [11] Both papers agree that their approaches are similar; in fact, we compare a character test, Duarte et al., from which we conclude that \"there are no significant differences between the two methods.\" First, we compare CMCS [2-series] with Tabu Search, for which we have detailed experimental results [11]. Then we also compare CMCS [2-series] with the approach used in [9]. Tabu Search has two phases: (i) a classic taboo search based on a relatively small neighborhood that runs until it fails to improve the solution (ii) a polishing process similar to ours that repeats a sequence of mountain climbing operators, OptY, FlpX and FlpY."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusions", "text": "In this thesis, we considered an important combinatorial optimization problem called the Bipartite Boolean Programming Problem (BBQP). We defined several algorithmic components for BBQP, which primarily target components for metaheuristics. In order to test and combine the performance of the components, we designed a flexible metaheuristic scheme, which we call Conditional Markov Chain Search (CMCS), whose behavior is fully defined by a set of parameters and which is suitable for automatic configuration. CMCS is a powerful multi-standard metterling scheme."}, {"heading": "7.1. Future Work", "text": "Another way to create a new class of powerful components is to reduce the overall problem by adding constraints of the form xi = xi \u2032, xi 6 = xi \u2032 or xi = 1, or even more complex ones such as xi = xi \u2032. Note that such constraints effectively reduce the original problem to a smaller BBQP; then this smaller BBQP can be solved accurately or heuristically. Also, if such constraints are generated to be consistent with the current solution, this approach can be used as a mountaineer operator. It is interesting to note that the smaller size sub-problem itself could be solved by configuring a version of CMCS to be effective for short, intense runs. This gives the fascinating possibility of a superficial CMCS process in which one of the components uses a different CMCS system, although one might expect such a component to be tuned differently."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This research was supported in part by a complement to the NSERC Discovery accelerator awarded to Abraham P.

Bipartite Boolean Quadratic Programming Problem (BBQP) which is an extension of the well known Boolean Quadratic Programming Problem (BQP). Applications of the BBQP include mining discrete patterns from binary data, approximating matrices by rank-one binary matrices, computing the cut-norm of a matrix, and solving optimisation problems such as maximum weight biclique, bipartite maximum weight cut, maximum weight induced subgraph of a bipartite graph, etc. For the BBQP, we first present several algorithmic components, specifically, hill climbers and mutations, and then show how to combine them in a high-performance metaheuristic. Instead of hand-tuning a standard metaheuristic to test the efficiency of the hybrid of the components, we chose to use an automated generation of a multi-component metaheuristic to save human time, and also improve objectivity in the analysis and comparisons of components. For this we designed a new metaheuristic schema which we call Conditional Markov Chain Search (CMCS). We show that CMCS is flexible enough to model several standard metaheuristics; this flexibility is controlled by multiple numeric parameters, and so is convenient for automated generation. We study the configurations revealed by our approach and show that the best of them outperforms the previous state-of-the-art BBQP algorithm by several orders of magnitude. In our experiments we use benchmark instances introduced in the preliminary version of this paper and described here, which have already become the de facto standard in the BBQP literature.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
