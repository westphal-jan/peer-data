Each dialogue session is a dialogue between a guide and a tourist, in which the guide helps the tourist plan a trip to Singapore by making recommendations based on the tourist's preferences. These 35 dialogues add up to 31,034 utterances and 273,580 words. All recorded dialogues, totalling 21 hours, have been manually transcribed and subdivided with language files and semantic labels for each utterance, as well as dialogue states for each subdialog. Each dialogue is subdivided into subdialogs, each of which has a topic and contains several utterances. Dialogue states are commented on for each subdialog. A dialog state is presented as a list of slot value pairs. The slot is a general category, while the value indicates what the dialog participants have in mind."}, {"heading": "3 Method", "text": "This section introduces the dialog status trackers we used for the challenge. We describe two rule-based trackers, two machine learning-based trackers and one hybrid tracker."}, {"heading": "3.1 Fuzzy matching baseline", "text": "A simple rules-based tracker provided by the challenge organizers performs a fuzzy string matching between each value in ontology and the utterance. If the matching score is above a certain threshold for a value, then any slot value pair with that value is considered present."}, {"heading": "3.2 Machine-learning-based trackers", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Cascade tracker", "text": "The cascade tracker aims to refine the fuzzy matching tracker. For each slot, a classifier is trained to detect whether the slot is present or not. If a slot for a given utterance is predicted to be present, then the fuzzy matching score is calculated between each value of the detected slot and the utterance. For the classifier, we have tried logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF): We have left RF as it delivers the best results. The features used are unigrams, bigrams, word vectors and named entities. We get the word vector functions by mapping each word of the utterance to a word vector and then adding them all up. We use pre-trained word vectors provided on the word2vec website1."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Joint tracker", "text": "The main weakness of the cascade tracker is that it relies on fuzzy matching to detect the value, rather than using more meaningful functions. To solve this problem, the common tracker forecasts the slot and the value together. For each slot, an RF classifier is trained to determine whether a certain value is present or not. The same features are used as in the cascade tracker. As the vast majority of values are missing in a given utterance, the negative examples are counted down during the training phase."}, {"heading": "3.3 Elaborate rule-based tracker", "text": "Since the machine-learning approaches that use traditional functions perform poorly, a sophisticated rules-based tracker pair has been designed to overcome the shortcomings of the machine-learning approaches, and the main pipeline of the elaborate rules-based tracker is in Figure 1. The tracker uses the knowledge available in ontology and the synonym list defined for each slot value pair. Input from the slot state tracker is the current utterance (i.e. the utterance for which the tracker should predict the slot value pairs) and the dialog history. The dialog history contains the list of previous utterances as well as the list of slot value pairs that the tracker has predicted for the previous utterances. Finally, based on the input and knowledge, the tracker gives a list of slot value pairs that match the current slot value pairs and match the current slot value pairs."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Robust synonym matching", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it will be able to put itself at the top, \"he said in an interview with the\" Welt am Sonntag. \""}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Coreference resolution for dialogs", "text": "The co-references are numerous in dialogues, but more difficult to detect than in formal text, since existing co-reference resolution systems typically work well on the latter, but not on the former. The tracker contains a co-reference resolution system for spatial anaphores. This system is tailor-made for slot filling tasks and works as follows: For each utterance, the tracker uses its syntactical analysis tree to detect the presence of the following three templates: \u2022 Template 1: possessive adjective (my / your / our) + some kind of place \u2022 Template 2: demonstrative pronoun (the / this / that / these / those) + some kind of place \u2022 Template 3: here / thereFor example, \"our hotel\" and \"your museums\" belong to Template 1, and \"this garden\" and \"these parks\" belong to Template 2. If Template 1 or Template 2 is present, the tracker considers the last detected slot value pair of the same type in the slot when the slot type dialog is specified as the slot-3."}, {"heading": "3.3.3 Ontology-based slot-value pair pruning", "text": "Among the slot value pairs, which are determined by synonym matching and coreference resolution, there is often a group of slot value pairs that are closely related to each other, e.g. different branches of the same hotel chain. However, in most situations, only one of these slot value pairs is present in the dialogue state. To select the most likely slot value pair among the closely related slot value pairs, the tracker uses the domain knowledge available in ontology as well as the observations from the training data. For example, for each hotel listed as a possible value, the ontology contains additional information about the hotel, such as its neighborhood and price range. When multiple hotel branches are detected from the synonym matching step, the tracker checks whether other related information about the branch is found in context and selects the most likely branch based on the observation. If no relevant information is found, the tracker selects the most likely value from the previous branch based on the training observations."}, {"heading": "3.3.4 Slot-value pair carrying over", "text": "As a result, the tracker implements the following rule: For certain slots, the slot-value pair will remain in place until a different value appears for the same slot or theme. For which slots it is optimal, the tracker learns by using the training data and comparing the predictive results of the slot-value pair with and without the rule for a given slot. If the slot value pair is not in use, the tracker will use the training data to determine the slot-value pair prediction results."}, {"heading": "3.4 Hybrid tracker", "text": "In order to exploit the strengths of both the rules-based and machine-learning approach, the hybrid tracker uses the outputs of the rules-based tracker as features for the common tracker. As Figure 3 shows, the outputs of all four main steps of the complex rules-based tracker are used as features."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to a different world in which they are able to escape than to another world in which they are able to escape."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and future work", "text": "This paper describes and compares several dialog trackers on the DSTC 4 Corpus. Due to the size of the ontology and the expressions that are only flagged on the subdialogue level, the rules-based approach delivers better results than the pure machine learning approaches. Our method achieves a rules-based tracker as a feature for the machine learning process and for the final evaluation of the main task, our method came first among 7 competing teams and 24 entries. Our method achieves an F1 score 9 and 7 percentage points higher than the runner-up for the utterance evaluation and for the subdialogue evaluation."}], "references": [{"title": "Deep neural network approach for the dialog state tracking challenge", "author": ["M.
