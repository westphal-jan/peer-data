The problem is where the lines can be placed.Even more general mechanisms can be appliced.A high-level summary of what is done in the previous sections indicates at least two possible directions of generalization; the principle applies to both two- and tripartitions: a. Each partition has a set of maximums; and b. Each maxim induces a partition. Abstracted from the specific realization, a partition is a way to represent the relative reliability of the sources, and maxim is a way to condense formulations."}, {"heading": "7.1 Percentage bounds", "text": "The most obvious extension of the method is the distribution of the sources to the percentage of correct formulas that they provide, which allows as many classes as desired. For example, the first class contains the sources that provide only correct formulas, the second, which provide between 90% and 100% of correct formulas, etc. The problem with any method of this kind is that the limits are arbitrary: why is the reader not asked to accept a division based on some fixed limits with some intuitive appeal: reliability is tied to 90%, unreliability to 50%. These numbers consider a source as reliable if it provides 90% or more of the correct formulas, unreliable if it delivers less than 50% of them."}, {"heading": "7.2 Ordering", "text": "Another way to implement the principle of reliability of the sources from a possible result of the merger is the use of orders for both. In particular, the relative reliability of the sources can be encoded as an order over the sources, and a possible result of the merger over the interpretations. The reliability of the sources can be expressed through a relationship in which the reliability of the sources is evaluated, and an evaluation of the reliability of the sources through one or more priorities over the interpretations. The reliability of the sources can be expressed through a relationship between the two."}, {"heading": "7.3 Weighted Merge", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "8 Directions", "text": "The principle examined in this article is that some assurance orders can be excluded on the grounds that their use for revision leads to a different sequence, and the way this principle is implemented is based on the assumption that the sources generate a single or a series of formulas, that the assurance order is represented by a division of the sources or by weighting, and that the merge is carried out by maxims or a weighted summary. Apart from how the assurance order and the merge process are implemented, the principle itself can be extended in many ways."}, {"heading": "8.1 Sure information", "text": "This may be the direction of most interests: Some sources of unknown reliability provide formulas for merging, but some information is also known for sure. It is a common scenario of merging beliefs, encoded by integrity limitations [13] as follows: In selecting those that produce the result of the merger, only the models that meet them are taken into account; the fixed point definition allows for a smooth coding of formulas that are considered safe; they are collected in a single source, and only reliability orders that have that source are taken into account; since the first class of an induced partition contains only formulas consistent with the result of the merger, such a result is consistent with all of these formulas; formatting certain information as a source has the advantage of treating it consistently with the other formulas; there is no prior reason why another source could not be equally safe; if so, then it is the first class of reliability discipline."}, {"heading": "8.2 Partial reliability ordering", "text": "Restriction to reliability orders with a particular source in the first class is only a specific case of partial information about the reliability statement. If S0 is such a source, S0 \u2264 Si applies to any other source in the first class. More generally, an arbitrary partial information about the order can be assumed. It may, for example, be that only S1 < S2 and S2 \u2264 S3 are known. This excludes the partition (S2 | S1S3), but neither (S1 | S2S3) nor (S1 | S2 | S3). Since divisions and tripartitions provide for a strong separation between classes (all true, some true, none true), limitations of type \u2264 are more appropriate for them, as otherwise a seemingly harmless statement such as \"S1 is strictly more reliable than S2\" \"would result in\" S1 being only partially reliable \"leading to the strong conclusion that S2 is absolutely unreliable. Such strict limitations are left to several classes as S1 < S2 are only correct in S1."}, {"heading": "8.3 Untrustable sources", "text": "The first two are clearly defined, as they are the sources that only provide correct formulas and some correct formulas. However, the meaning of the third class changes depending on the direction considered: Partition \u2192 Maximum formulas are included in the third class if they match the formulas of the first two; maxset \u2192 Partition, a source goes to the third class if all of its formulas are incompatible with the maxim. In the first point, formulas are included only if possible; in the second, they are not. Only if the partition is stable, the two match. This underscores the ambiguity of the definition of a source that is \"absolutely unreliable.\" It can be a source that is less reliable than all the others, but in principle it can provide correct information, but it can also be a source that always provides wrong information.The third class can therefore be divided into two categories. A maximum formula can include formulas the first subclass if it is consistent with the rest of the class, but it is only the first source, rather than the first one that is consistent in principle."}, {"heading": "8.4 Flexible bounds", "text": "Splitting up the sources to 100% and 0% of the correct formulas, as with duplicates and triplicates, is based on a qualitative notion of reliability and unreliability, any other limit (such as 80% or 50%) is difficult to motivate compared to others (such as 90% and 51%).One possible solution is to assume that such a partition (S1 | S2S3 | S4) only means that there is a reason to believe that S1 is more reliable than S2 and S3, which are both more reliable than S4, without requiring two fixed boundaries between them. As an example, this division is acceptable if the four sources provide 80%, 72%, 69% and 30% correct formulas; the limit can be set to 75% and 50% to support this division, but also to 79% and 60% or 79% and 40%. This mechanism overrides the decision on an exact pair of correct formulas to define a source reliably or reliably partially."}, {"heading": "8.5 Technical results", "text": "Lemma 11 allows the creation of a scenario with given partitions and maxims, but only if they meet certain conditions. It would be interesting to find out whether these limitations can be overrided.The two algorithms presented in this article cover only the case of two partitions. Extending them to three partitions or even to the case of arbitrary partitions would make them applicable to more general situations. Also, the complexity of inferring from the maxims of stable partitions or verifying the existence of strongly stable three partitions is an open problem."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions", "text": "The principle of exclusivity is always the same: the second group can split in one direction or the other in order to achieve stable stability; the second group is able to orient itself in the other direction; the third group is able to orient itself in the other direction, namely in the direction in which it moves; the third group is able to orient itself in the other direction, in the direction in which it moves; the third group is able to orient itself in the other direction, in the direction in which it moves; the third group is able to orient itself in the other direction, in the direction in which it moves; and the third group is able to orient itself in the other direction in which it moves."}], "references": [{"title": "Knowledge sharing and Yahoo Answers: everyone knows something", "author": ["L.

of the sources of the information to be merged. They are typically assumed equally reliable in lack of hints indicating otherwise [12]; yet, a recent line of research spun from the idea of deriving this information from the revision process itself. In particular, the history of previous revisions [3, 15] and previous merging examples [16] provide information for performing subsequent mergings. Yet, no examples or previous revisions may be available. In spite of the apparent lack of information, something can still be inferred by a try-and-check approach: a relative reliability ordering is assumed, the merging process is performed based on it, and the result is compared with the original information. The outcome of this check may be incoherent with the initial assumption, like when a completely reliable source is rejected some of the information it provided. In such cases, the reliability ordering assumed in the first place can be excluded from consideration. The first theorem of this article proves that such a scenario is indeed possible. Other results are obtained under various definition of reliability and merging.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
