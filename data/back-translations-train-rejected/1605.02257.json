However, for all their meaning, prepositions have received relatively little attention in composed semantics, and the community has not even achieved a comprehensive and reliable scheme for the annotation of semantic prepositions in context (Figure 2). We believe that such a annotation of prepositions is necessary when prepositions in composed semantics receive relatively little attention."}, {"heading": "2 Background and Motivation", "text": "Theoretical linguists puzzle over questions such as how individual prepositions can acquire such a broad spectrum of meanings - and to what extent these meanings are systematically linked (e.g. Brugman, 1981; Lakoff, 1987; Tyler and Evans, ar Xiv: 160 5.02 257v 1 [cs.C L] 8M ay2 0162003; O'Dowd, 1998; Saint-Dizier and Ide, 2006; Lindstromberg, 2010).Prepositional polysemia has also been recognized as a challenge to artificial intelligence (Herskovits, 1986) and the processing of natural language that motivates semantic disambiguity systems (O'Hara and Wiebe, 2003; Ye and Baldwin, 2007; Hovy et al., 2010; Srikumar and Roth, 2013b)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Existing Preposition Corpora", "text": "Starting with the groundbreaking resources from the Preposition Project (TPP; Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005), the computational study of preposition semantics is essentially based on a corpus-based lexicography that revolves around individual preposition types. Most previous datasets of preposition semantics at the token level (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005, 2007; Dahlmeier et al., 2009; Tratz and Hovy, 2009; Srikumar and Roth, 2013a) cover only high-frequency prepositions (the 34 represented in the SemEval-2007 split task based on TPP or a subset thereof). 3We sought a scheme that would allow comprehensive semantic annotation of all preposition types in a corpus: it would have to cover the full range of uses for the full range of English preposition types."}, {"heading": "2.2 Supersenses", "text": "From the literature on other types of supersense, there is reason to believe that symbolic annotations with3A further limitation of the SemEval-2007 dataset is the way in which it was sampled: illustrative signs from a corpus were selected manually by a lexicographer. As (Litkowski, 2014) has shown, a disambiguation system trained on this dataset will therefore be biased and poorly based on an ecologically valid sample of tokens. Preposition Supersenses (Schneider et al., 2015) will be more scalable and useful than sensory perceptions. The term supersense has been applied to lexical semantic classes that characterize a large number of word types (i.e., they are unxicalized). The most well-known supersense scheme refers to two inventories - one for nouns and one for verbals - that have arisen as a high-grade partitioning of senses."}, {"heading": "2.3 PrepWiki", "text": "Schneider et al.'s (2015) Preposition Supersense schema is described in detail in a lexical resource, PrepWiki, 4, which records associations between supersenses and preposition types. In the following, we assume the use of the term for a pairing of a preposition type and a supersense label - e.g. at / TIME. Usages4http: / / tiny.cc / prepwikisare organized in PrepWiki via (lexicalized) senses from the TPP lexicon. Mapping is multi-faceted, as senses and supersenses capture different generalizations. (The lexicalized TPP senses are more numerous and generally finer-grained, but in some cases functions are summarized that obtain different supersense, as in the sense of 2 (2) \"affect, in relation to or in relation to.\") Thus, a sense for a given preposition can be mapped to multiple uses and vice versa."}, {"heading": "2.4 The Supersense Hierarchy", "text": "Of the four Supersense schemes mentioned above, Schneider et al.'s (2015) inventory of prepositions (which has improved over the inventory of Srikumar and Roth (2013a)) is unique in its hierarchy. It is an inheritance hierarchy (see Figure 2): characteristics of higher categories are invoked to apply to their offspring. Multiple inheritance is used in cases of overlapping: GOAL inherits from LOCATION (because a goal is a point in physical space) as well as GOAL (it is the end point of a concrete or abstract path). The structure of the hierarchy has been modelled on the VerbNet hierarchy of thematic roles (Bonial et al., 2011; Hwang, 2014). But there are many more categories: Some are refinements of VerbNet roles (e.g. subclasses of TIME), while others have no VerbNet counterparts because they do not relate to core roles of TIME."}, {"heading": "3 Corpus Annotation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Annotating Preposition Supersenses", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "3.2 Quality Control", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "3.3 Resulting Corpus", "text": "Their distribution appears in Figure 5. Over 75% of the chips belong to the top 10 preposition types, while the supersense distribution is rather uniform. 1170 chips are called LOCATION, PATH or a subtype thereof: These can roughly be described as spatial. 528 chips come from the TEMPORAL subtree of the hierarchy and 452 from the CONFIGURATION subtree. Thus, full half of the chips (2100) mark non-spatial participants and circumstances. Of the 4250 chips are 582 MWEs (multiword prepositions and / or PP idioms).11 A further 588 have non-supersense labels: 484 'i, 83' d and 21 '."}, {"heading": "3.4 Splits", "text": "To facilitate future experiments on a standard benchmark, we divided our data into training and test sets. We sampled a random sample of 447 sets (4,073 total tokens and N = 950 = 19.6% of preposition instances) for a held test set, leaving 3,888 preposition instances for training.12 The sample was layered by preposition supersense to promote a reasonable balance for the rare labels; e.g., twice occurring supersense is split so that an instance is assigned to the training set11. To count prepositions by type, we break down supersense-tagged PP idioms such as those in (5) and (6) by prepositioning the longest prefix of words that has a PrepWiki entry."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced a new lexical semantic corpus that disambiguates prepositions with hierarchical supersensualities. As it is extensively commented on in complete documents, it provides insights into the semantic distribution of prepositions. The corpus will further facilitate the development of automatic preposition disambiguation systems."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank our commentators - Evan Coles-Harris, Audrey Farber, Nicole Gordiyenko, Megan Hutto, Celeste Smitz and Tim Watervoort - as well as Ken Litkowski, Michael Ellsworth, Orin Hargraves and Susan Brown for helpful discussions.
