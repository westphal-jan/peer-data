It is \"a book of images and simple words [...] with only the ten hundred words in our language that people use the most.\" [12] and it is both funny and completely serious. The quote comes from the introduction of the book, and therefore it is written even in this language, by only the 1 '000 most commonly used English words (and so, of course, is the title of the book). The following paragraph is another example from the section on nuclear power plants that explain radioactivity: The particular heat is made when tiny pieces of the metal collapse. This leaves a lot of heat, far more than any normal fire could. But for many types of metal, it happens very slowly. A piece of metal as old as the earth can only be broken in half, around the popularity of New York 12. \""}, {"heading": "2 Language Analysis", "text": "Although the book and its language have become very popular, not much has been written about the details of the language, the connection to other similar languages, and the exact rules that underlie it. Randall Munroe himself introduced the language in the book with only a few sentences."}, {"heading": "2.1 Similar Languages", "text": "The new language of Thing Explainer is similar to some of the earliest English-language CNLs. Basic English [13] was probably the first such language introduced in 1930. It limits the allowed words to only 850 root words, but there are many variations of the language. The chosen words and the rules for their use are much more structured than the Thing Explainer language, but allows only 18 verbs and does not restrict the number of verbs so drastically. It is based on a list of 1,500 words and has been used since 1959 by the Voice of America, the official external broadcaster of the United States. In both cases, the words on the list are not grammatically limited and not so drastically limited."}, {"heading": "2.2 Language Properties", "text": "According to the PENS classification scheme that I proposed in my survey on the subject [11], the Thing Explainer language is of the same type as Special English, namely P1E5N5S1. This is also the type of full, unrestricted English, which means that the limitations of the Thing Explainer language do not differ substantially from the dimensions of the PENS scheme: precision, expressiveness, naturalness and simplicity. It is not much more precise than full English, since the limited vocabulary is not accompanied by any semantic limitations, and the grammar is not limited at all, and therefore the vagueness and ambiguity of natural language is not significantly lessened. In terms of expressiveness and naturalness, however, the power of full English remains intact: Randall Munroe at least comes close to proving that basically everything that can be expressed in full English can also be expressed in a way that may sometimes be natural, but always quite funny."}, {"heading": "2.3 Word List", "text": "Randall Munroe reports it this way: I spent several months going through a series of different lists and creating some of my own based on the Google Book corpus and even my own email inbox. I then combined the lists, and where they did not match, I simply let my sense of consistency prevail. [10] Conjugated forms of verbs and plural forms of adjectives are not listed separately, but merged with the simple word form, as Randall Munroe explains: \"I count different word forms - like\" talk, \"\" talk, \"and\" speak \"- as one word.\" However, this is not true of comparative and superlative forms of adjectives (good, better, and best of all separate entries), adjective forms of adjectives (easy and easy to count as two words), or pronouns (me, mine and mine are separate entries). This result in a portion of the list of 98 words, which are the very two words that are the ones that I pair."}, {"heading": "2.4 Word Production Rules", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "2.5 Word Distribution", "text": "Finally, we can take a look at the word frequency distribution of word forms as observed in the book, and at the \"lemmatized\" words as they appear on the list. We can check whether they follow a power distribution (Zipf's Law) just as accurately as other types of text [6]. There is no obvious reason why a text in a CNL must follow the same distribution as an unrestricted one, but it would not be surprising either. The left part of Figure 3 shows that the distribution of word occurrences actually follows quite exactly a distribution of the kind of a law of power, as can be seen from the almost straight line on the protocol diagram. Nevertheless, the line is more curved than other such word distributions [6], and thus tends somewhat towards a \"normal\" exponential distribution and away from a pure law of power. This effect is even more pronounced in the lemmatized case as it is shown on the right side of Figure 3. In texts in unrestricted language, the power distribution has been shown to be significantly better than the 0.0007 hypothesis that we can redistribute power in each case."}, {"heading": "3 Methods", "text": "For the analysis presented above, the text is taken from an electronic version of the book (without introductory pages and word list), and the book contains handwritten parts that are not covered. Afterwards, all characters except letters, hyphens and apostrophes are deleted, letters are converted to lowercase letters, some errors in text extraction are corrected in the form of missing and additional spaces, words are separated, combined words such as don are not extended, standardized to a, Saxon genitive markers are omitted, text is marked with spaces and composite words are divided (if the components are recognized words).The resulting list of tokens is then used for analysis. Furthermore, WordNet is used to recognize the categories of words and lemmatize irregular shapes. For analysis of the law of power, the python package powerlaw [2] is used."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "While the topics covered by Thing Explainer are entirely serious and the book tries (I think it manages to convey complex topics in a highly intelligible way), the book is also funny and the result of a challenge of how far we can go. \"Elsewhere, he writes\" a light drink that wakes you up, \"even though both tea and coffee are on the list. On the other hand, there are a number of simple and important words that are not on the list."}], "references": [{"title": "Thing explainer: Complicated stuff in simple words by Randall Munroe \u2014 funny, precise and beautifully designed", "author": ["N.
