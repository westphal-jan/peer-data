OUR APPROACH", "text": "It is well known that languages that have a preference and free word order are much more difficult for automatic analysis than, for example, the English language. As shown in [13, pp. 100], the free word order implies a non-projected grammar. However, in [14] and [15] this dependence on non-projected grammars it is shown that the way it is used is worth much less than a very narrow subclass called edge-factored grammars. This challenge is addressed, among other things, by transitional dependency patterns. [12] For problems with relationships in German where the word order is much less free than in Polish.

POS tagging and dependency parsing", "text": "For part of the speech output, we use the Apache OpenNLP (http: / / opennlp.apache.org) tagger, which was trained with the Maximum Entropy Classifier on the NKJP [19] corpus. In addition, we have optimized the tag disambiguation process for known words by narrowing tags that can be selected by information from the PoliMorf dictionary [20]. For the Polish language, whose tagset contains about 1000 tags [21], this simple optimization leads to an improvement in tagging in terms of accuracy and processing speed at the same time. To give an example, the word artyku\u0142\u00f3w (the inflected form of the word article) has only two possible tags subst: pl: gen: m3 and subst: pl: gen: p3."}, {"heading": "B. Promising dependency tree structure selection", "text": "It is worth noting that in this case we are using some of the patterns shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3, where form, dep, and pos mean: symbolic form, dependency types (as described in [23]), and part-of-speech tag (as described in [19]). The difference between structure 1, 2, and 3 is in the grammatical case of predicative complementation and part of the speech of the predicate. Our intuition is that selected structures are natural sources of the IS-A relationship. This assertion is supported by the precision obtained in experiments carried out.

The list is assumed to represent distances of a class. \u2022 Recognize the class name in words of R with a conditional random field model [26]. Words in this part of the sentence are marked with either \"1\" or \"0.\" The sequence of \"1\" closest to R is assumed to represent the class."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "Experiments lead to interesting conclusions. First, there are hardly any intersections between the IS-A relationships, which are extracted by the three methods: the traditional method of the heart and our methods, one based on nominative, the other on instrumental case. The IS-A relationship space seems too sparse to lead such methods to overlapping results. Nominative construction produces fewer relationships than instrumental, which is probably a consequence of the fact that this construct mukowiscydoza (Mukowiscydoza) IS-A 1. Choroba (disease) 2.

It can be linked to the natural language model in which the distribution of word frequencies has a probability distribution of the power law [27]. There is a lot of specific, domain-specific taxonomic information that is rare in textual resources accessible on the Internet. On the other hand, more general knowledge that can be found several times in the text is much less frequent. Of course, pseudo-subclasses do not give a boost when t = 1 and do not affect precision, because we simply accept everything that happens to the final filter rules. In other cases, psc significantly increases the number of extractions (the higher the better), although not as much as the effects of the extraction are eliminated. This boost method is very advantageous for the support level as it increases by 23% (without IV loss)."}, {"heading": "VI. FUTURE WORK", "text": "It is planned to adapt selected coreference resolution methods to our BigData environment and verify their effectiveness with increasing precision of our extraction method. We plan to achieve better detection of phrase beginnings / endpoints by replacing the construction rules described in Section II-D with conditional random field classifiers trained in our experiment with manually annotated correct phrase boundaries. Of course, creating such gold standard sentences with IS-A relationships is more time consuming than the approach proposed in this paper."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This paper introduces a novel method of IS-A relation extraction from Polish patterns, which differs from the much-loved Hearst patterns and is applicable in inflected languages with free word order. Thanks to this method, we have been able to extract knowledge that cannot be expressed in enumeration constructs defined by Hearst. In addition, a method for increasing relation extraction is being introduced. As mentioned above, it has potential application in any pattern-based IS-A relation extraction method thanks to its simplicity. Experiments have shown that the algorithm achieves a satisfactory precision 9 (although there is room for improvement) and is capable of generating a high number of taxonomic relationships, making it a valuable input source for any taxonomic induction task. Needless to say, the experiments described in this paper do not provide a complete statistical overview of millions of IS-A relationships, which are concentrated from the cortical analysis of the polarity document we present on such Internet assessment."}], "references": [{"title": "Unsupervised ontology induction from text", "author": ["H.
