FDGs are used in a 3D object recognition problem due to the importance of considering or not considering structural relationships. FDGs are generated by a series of attributed graphs representing some views of the model. Results show that FDGs retain the semantic and structural information of the objects.

Introduction", "text": "This chapter presents the state of the art in pattern recognition, as well as the main methods and algorithms that describe patterns, from the beginnings in the early 1970s to our own day. We introduce our new method with the aim of overcoming as far as possible the problems involved in working with graphics. Finally, we present the organization of this documentation. 1.1. Structural pattern recognition A fundamental problem in pattern recognition is the selection of suitable representations for objects and classes. In the decision-theoretical approach to pattern recognition, a pattern is represented by a set of numerical values that form a vector (Chisel, 1972). Although in many tasks objects can be successfully detected using global properties such as size and compactness, it is helpful to describe an object in its basic parts and the relationships between them (Bunke and Sanfeliu, 1990). Hence, in the syntactic and structural approach to pattern recognition, an object is described in a series of primitive compiled objects."}, {"heading": "Optimal approaches", "text": "The A * algorithms calculate the error-correcting sub-graph isomorphism in the following way. In the case of a graph iG and a possibly distorted graph jG, a search tree is expanded so that each state in the tree corresponds to a partial mapping of the vertices of iG to vertices in jG. At the top of the search tree, the first vertex of iG is mapped to each vertex of jG. Each such mapping and the associated costs is a state in the search tree. The generation of successor states then orients itself on the cost of the mappings. That is, the mapping of the vertex with the lowest cost is extended by mapping a new vertex of iG to each vertex of jG that has not yet been used. Finally, all vertex of iG are mapped to vertices of jG and a fault-correcting sub-graph isomorphism."}, {"heading": "Graph edit operations", "text": "Probably the best-known error correction model for graph matching is similar to the model used in string processing (Wagner and Fischer, 1974). It is based on the idea of introducing graph processing operations (Sanfeliu and Fu, 1983). For each possible error type, a corresponding graph processing operation is defined. In order to model that certain error types are more likely than others, cost functions are assigned to the processing operations. The definition of cost functions is highly application-dependent. Graph processing operations are then used to correct errors in the graphs. Thus, informally, an error-correcting sub-graph isomorphic is defined as a sequence of processing operations with minimal costs that must be applied to one of the graphs in such a way that a subgraph isomorphic exists. This approach is described in Section 2.2 and proposed in Chapter 10 as a distance between assigned graphs in the 3D object application."}, {"heading": "Approximate approaches", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "2. Attributed Graphs (AGs)", "text": "This chapter gives some basic definitions of assigned graphs and reminds us of the distance measurement between AGs (sections 4.4 and 4.5) and the distance between AGs and FDGs (section 5). Furthermore, it makes sense to compare the SDGs and FDGs (section 8) by any distance measurement between AGs and Fu, so that the properties of the dissimilation measures between AGs and FDGs can be discussed. Clustering algorithms (section 8) are parameterized by any distance measurement between AGs, but in our application (chapter 9) we use the properties of the dissimilation measures between AGs and FDGs, which are presented in section 5."}, {"heading": "3. Random graphs (RGs)", "text": "A random graph, as defined by Wong et al. (Wong and You, 1985; Wong, \u03b2 and You, 1990) is a graph structure with randomly varying vertex and arc attribute values. In other words, it is a graph, along with a set of jointly distributed random variables, some (one for each vertex), spanning pattern primitives and others (one for each arc). Any AG obtained by instantiating all random slots and random arcs is referred to as the result graph of the random graph. Hence, a random graph, represents the set of all possible AGs that can result, according to an associated probability distribution. Below, we review the definitions of general random slots (Section 3.1) and random first-order random graphs (Section 3.2) before (Section 3.2) proposed graphs (Wong and You) have adapted to our 1985 Notquity."}, {"heading": "4. Function-described graphs (FDGs)", "text": "An FDG is a prototype structure that contains, on the one hand, probability functions that represent the semantic information of the local parts of the patterns, and, on the other, binary functions to maintain as much as possible the local properties of the AGs that belong to the class and also to reject the AGs that do not belong to it. Generally, an FDG can be derived as random graphics by synthesizing a cluster or a set of individual AGs. Section 4.1 compares FDGs and FORGs and describes the novel features of the FDGs that represent a set of AGs. Then, Section 4.2 gives a formal definition of an FDG and Section 4.3 presents some technical details about FDG functions. Finally, Sections 4.4 and 4.5 discuss the synthesis of an FDG from a set of AGs and a set of FDGs with common areas of application of their functions."}, {"heading": "5.

In the first section, distance is introduced using the Bayesian theory. () The distance measurement between AGs and FDGs is therefore considered in the second section as a way that is considered too rough in real application practice. () However, the unclear elements mean that this distance becomes too rough in real application practice, as if it proposes a different distance, in which the second order relaxes the constraints on antagonism, occurrence and existential relationships. Finally, in Section 5.4 a simple example of both distances is an outlined.5.1 Distance measurement and the Bayesian theory frameworkTo the matching between an AG G (data graph) and an FDG F (prototype graph) like the Bayesian theory, as in (Wilson, 1997)."}, {"heading": "6.

A classical probabilistic relaxation scheme is presented in Section 7.1, then the subunits commented on above are presented and defined in Sections 7.2 and 7.3, and a distance measurement between the subunits and a suitable algorithm is proposed to calculate this distance.

However, given a number of isomorphisms applied to a common underlying structure, an FDG can be generated from the overall ensemble, since the global optimization problem does not lead to a computationally practical method for choosing the labeling, because there are too many possible orientations, especially when the number and sequence of AGs is high.

In the decision-theoretic approach to pattern recognition, a pattern is represented by a set of numerical values, which forms a feature vector. Although, in many tasks, objects can be recognised successfully using only global features such as size and compactness, in some applications it is helpful to describe an object in terms of its basic parts and the relations between them. Nevertheless, there are two major problems that practical applications using structural pattern recognition are confronted with. The first problem is the computational complexity of comparing two structures. The time required by any of the optimal algorithms may in the worst case become exponential in the size of the graphs. The approximate algorithms, on the other hand, have only polynomial time complexity, but do not guarantee to find the optimal solution. For some of the applications, this may not be acceptable. The second problem is the fact that there is more than one model graph that must be matched with an input graph, then the conventional graph matching algorithms must be applied to each model-input pair sequentially. As a consequence, the performance is linearly dependent on the size of the database of model graphs. For applications dealing with large database, this may be prohibitive. Function-described graphs (FDGs) are a compact representation of a set of attributed graphs. They have borrowed from \u201crandom graphs\u201d proposed by Wong et al. the ability to probabilistically model structural attribute information, while improving the capacity to record structural relationships that consistently appear throughout the data. They do this by incorporating qualitative knowledge of the second-order probabilities of the elements that are expressed as relations (Boolean functions) between pairs of vertices and pairs of arcs in the FDGs. Four approaches and algorithms for building FDGs from an ensemble of attributed graphs are presented. The first synthesises an FDG in a supervised manner. The other three use the supervised clustering algorithms: dynamic, complete and single clustering. The problem of matching attributed graphs (AGs) to FDGs for recognition or classification purposes is studied from a Bayesian perspective. A distance measure between AGs and FDGs is derived from the principle of maximum likelihood, but robustness is enforced by considering only locally the effects of extraneous and missing elements. A second measure is also given in which the second-order constraints are incorporated as additional costs. A branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed to compute these distance measures together with their corresponding optimal labelling. Because of the exponential cost of this algorithm, three efficient algorithms are also proposed and compared to compute sub-optimal distances between AGs and FDGs. Two of them are based on a probabilistic relaxation approach, and the other does not have an iterative technique. Some experimental tests are presented in random graphs and a 3D-object recognition problem. In the 3D-object recognition application, an FDG model is synthesised (in a supervised and an unsupervised method) for each object from a set of views (AGs). The second-order information in FDGs is shown so that the recognition ration is better than when the first-order probability distributions are only used. Results of efficient algorithms show that there is an important decrease in the run time although there is only a slight decrease in effectiveness.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
