Thus, for example, it has been found that body language is a signal of affective information. [12] Since such behavior can be thought of as an expression of emotional states in part of the human body's cortical neural responses, the inclination angle of the head can be linked to inferiority- and superiority- related emotions [12]."}, {"heading": "2 A Bayeisan Emotion Regulated PerceptionAction Model", "text": "This is the question that arises as to whether this is a political project that develops in a way that puts the interests of the people at the centre, put at the centre by the interests of the people."}, {"heading": "3 A Learning Model", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Parametric Bias", "text": "Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias Units [19, 20, 28, 27, 26] (Fig. 2) is a family of recursive neural networks consisting of an additional bias unit that acts as bifurcation parameters for nonlinear dynamics. In other words, the adjustable values in such a small number of units can determine different dynamics in the network with large dimensions. As these units differ from ordinary bias, they are trained by the training sequences with backpropagation over time (BPTT) in a self-organizing manner, so that the units exhibit differences in the characteristics of the training sequences. Furthermore, the parametric bias units (PB units) give the network, as bifurcation parameters for nonlinear functions, the ability to learn various nonlinear dynamic attractors, making it advantageous compared to generic recursive networks. Based on the above features, an RNPB network can be considered a two-layered network based on the two-layered structure."}, {"heading": "3.2 Three Modes", "text": "The RNPB three running modes in an RNPB network, i.e. learning, detection and generation modes.

When providing the training impulse with a new pattern, the weights that connect neurons are updated with BPTT (back propagation over time).

Following the proposed two Bayesian conclusions between the internal state and sensorimotor behavior, we propose to use a recursive neural network of parametric bias units (RNPB) to construct a two-tiered architecture in which the parametric bias represents an internal state. Nonverbal generation of expressions and demonstrations of emotion recognition testify to the feasibility of this hierarchical architecture. In the next steps, a few possibilities can be created to further expand this architecture: 1) more factors such as goal, perception from previous states and knowledge can be considered, 2) a more complex hierarchical learning method can be used to extract and generate hierarchical hierarchies more strongly."}], "references": [{"title": "Bodily communication", "author": ["M.
