Nevertheless, some problems remain when we face the decision of selecting the most convenient model for a specific application. In the literature, several desirable adequacy properties have been proposed, but theoretical limits impede quantification models from simultaneously fulfilling every adequacy property that has been defined. Besides, the complexity of model definitions and adequacy properties makes very difficult for real users to understand the particularities of the different models that have been presented. In this work we will present several criteria conceived to help in the process of selecting the most adequate Quantifier Fuzzification Mechanisms for specific practical applications.

Afterwards, we argued that, while previously considered characteristics are very practical to separate \"good quantification models\" from \"bad ones,\" they are not sufficient to clearly distinguish between the analysed QFMs and, in particular, to help potential users choose the most convenient model for a particular application. To advance this problem, we have introduced a new set of criteria specifically designed to differentiate the behaviour of the analysed models."}], "references": [{"title": "Fuzzy power sets and fuzzy implication operators", "author": ["W.
