Patients received text messages to promote physical activity between once a day and once a week. Messages were personalized through a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that optimized messages to improve activity regime adherence in each participant. The RL algorithm was compared to a static policy for sending messages and weekly reminders. Our results show that participants who received messages generated by the RL algorithm increased activity and walking pace while those in the control group did not. Patients assigned to the RL algorithm group experienced superior lowering of blood glucose levels (HbA1c) compared to controls, and prolonged participation resulted in greater reductions in blood glucose levels.

Every morning, for each patient, an RL algorithm evaluated which SMS message was likely to increase the patient's physical activity the next day, and this message was sent to the patient. Users were represented for the RL algorithm by their demographics, past activity, expected activity and news history.The effectiveness of each message was evaluated the next morning by calculating the activity the patient has performed since the last message to him or her, and this signal served as a reward for training the RL algorithm."}, {"heading": "2.2 Patient Characteristics", "text": "Adult patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited for a 26-week study from the Endocrinology and Diabetes Clinic in a tertiary hospital. Inclusion criteria included: non-optimal glycemic control (HbA1c1 over 6.5%); a sedentary lifestyle with no specific physical activity up to enrollment in the study; and possession of an Android-based smartphone with data connection (WiFi at home or cellular data). Exclusion criteria were other types of diabetes; any disability that excludes walking for 20 minutes. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rambam Health Care Campus. All patients gave written consent. Upon enrollment, all participants received information on the importance of physical activity and a personalized prescription for an activity plan, including the number of sessions per week and time span each session (i.e., at least two hours of walking per week)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Types of Feedback Messages", "text": "Patients were divided into a control arm and a personalized arm, but the medical team was blinded to the type of text messages they received, and the control arm received identical, immutable weekly reminders to exercise. Patients in the personalized arm received daily feedback messages and weekly summaries. Daily feedback messages could be one of the following four messages: 1. Negative feedback: \"You need to exercise to achieve your activity goals. Please remember to exercise tomorrow.\" 2. Positive feedback relative to yourself (positive self): \"You have achieved N% of your weekly activity goal so far. Your exercise level is consistent with your plan. Keep up the good work.\" 3. Positive feedback relative to others (positive social): \"You have achieved N% of your weekly activity goal so far. You exercise more than the average person in your group. Your exercise level is consistent with your plan."}, {"heading": "2.4 Feedback Message Policies", "text": "After an initial phase in which feedback was sent according to a predetermined policy described in detail below (\"initial policy\"), the decision on which daily feedback message to send was decided by a learning algorithm (\"learned policy\"), so that the algorithm could collect information about results on less likely feedback strategies, the exploration [14] was used for messages that were considered less likely to be sent, so that they were sent with significant probabilities than follow in detail.The initial algorithm (hereby referred to as \"initial policy\") was set so that no message was sent on 20% of the days. We then drew a uniform random number between 0 and 1. If this number was greater than the expected fraction of weekly activity on that day, the user would receive the negative feedback message. Otherwise, they would receive one of the positive messages, with equal probability. After a sufficient number of instances we were collected, we implemented a decision-making mechanism for feedback."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Patient Characteristics", "text": "A total of 27 patients were recruited, the mobile app successfully installed and data transmitted for at least a week."}, {"heading": "3.2 Application Use and Physical Activity Measured", "text": "Targeted physical activity averaged 139 \u00b1 62 minutes per week. The app continued to provide activity data for an average of 20.0 (REM 1.6) weeks, and the intermittent transmission was largely due to a change of mobile phone or phone number during the study. Analyses were made of all participants who had successfully started the application, including those who had not completed the 26 weeks of the experiment. All patients reported that they had not engaged in regular physical activity prior to recruitment, but of course there was no objective acceleration data for the activity carried out prior to recruitment. We decided that we could not separate the timing of the provision of physical activity prescriptions from the recruitment process without distorting the data collected in the first weeks after recruitment."}, {"heading": "3.3 Effect of Different Messages Over Time", "text": "We examined how each of the messages individually and how each of the two consecutive messages affected the change in activity levels, and found significant differences in participants \"responses to different messages and message sequences. Figure 1 shows the average improvement in activity (yi, t) for each message and the overall change weighted by the likelihood of each feedback message. The best increase in activity was observed the day after a positive social message, while negative messages and positive self-messages led to a decrease in activity. Differences in activity change between the original policy and the learned policy were statistically significant (ANOVA, P = 0.0036). One of the attributes given as inputs to the learned policy was the time since the transmission of each feedback message. This provides a limited historical context to policy, so feedback may vary between days. Figure 2 shows the average improvement in activity for feedback on the day N, since feedback on the previous day (N) 1."}, {"heading": "3.4 Variability in patient response", "text": "The average improvement in activity varies between patients. To demonstrate this, we represented each user according to the average change in activity after each daily feedback message (i.e. a 4-dimensional vector). Figure 3 shows the results of clustering using k-means with 3 clusters. As the figure shows, a group of patients (cluster 1) reacted negatively to each feedback message. In contrast, patients in cluster 3 reacted positively to messages, particularly positive-social or positive-autonomous. This shows the importance of individually tailored feedback provided by our algorithm. Users in the different clusters reacted differently in their demographics. Table 2 shows the proportion of women and the average age of patients in each cluster. As the table shows, cluster 3, where patients responded positively to messages (Figure 3), is dominated by men. In contrast, cluster 2, where responses to messages were weaker overall, consists mainly of women. Age differences in clusters are marginal."}, {"heading": "3.5 The Learning Process of the Algorithm Over Time", "text": "We investigated how the messages generated by the learning algorithm changed over time as more information was collected about participants \"response to feedback relative to their previous activity and demographics. Figure 4 shows how the learning algorithm gradually improves in predicting activity, showing that much of the difference in activity on a given day can be explained by the learning algorithm, which indicates that much of patient behavior is predictable. Figure 4 shows the stability of the algorithm, which is calculated as the difference between the absolute values of the model parameters, and how much of the activity can be explained by predicting the learning algorithm, as given by the adapted R2 attribute over time. Second, R2 initially increases, reaching about 0.43. This means that much of the difference in exercise on a given day can be explained by the learning algorithm attribute, suggesting that the patient's behavior becomes more predictable the more data is collected."}, {"heading": "3.6 Improvement in Activity Quantity and Walking Rate", "text": "We modeled the change in activity performed by patients over time (represented as a fraction of the target activity) using linear regression. Figure 5 shows an example of the proportion of expected activity performed by a participant, along with the linear slope (which for this patient is 0.0016) of that activity over the duration of the experiment. A linear function was appropriate for each participant individually, and the average slope for participants in each policy group (weighted according to the fit of linear function) is shown in Table 3. As the table shows, the slope of the learned policy was superior to both the control population and the original policy. While the latter two exhibited a negative change in activity, the learned policy shows a positive slope that implies an increase in activity over time. The rate of walking (steps per minute) was measured throughout the experiment, with the change in average weekly walking time being modeled using a linear model."}, {"heading": "3.7 Change in Glycemic Control", "text": "The initial HbA1c for all participants was 7.8 \u00b1 1.0, and on average there was an improvement of 0.28 \u00b1 0.84 for HbA1c for all patients. As previously mentioned, the intensification of nutritional or medical treatment was not limited, so the change in HbA1c reflects a combination of the change in medical and dietary treatment and the change in exercise. To assess the impact of the variables of participation in the study on glycemic control, we constructed a linear model in which the dependent variable is the difference between the HbA1c level in recruitment and the latest available measurement of HbA1c. The independent variables are the number of days between measurements, the initial HbA1c value and the activity target. The allocation to the personalized policy, higher initial HbA1c values and lower activity targets resulted in a superior reduction in Hb1c (Ab2 = 0.00c = 0.3)."}, {"heading": "3.8 Participant Satisfaction", "text": "The results of the patient satisfaction questionnaire are shown in Table 4. Interestingly, both control and study group participants reported increased physical activity. The learned policy group reported that the SMS messages helped them to increase and maintain their activity significantly more than the control group (p < 10 \u2212 3). None of the control group participants felt helpful with the SMS messages. Both groups reported receiving enough messages, although we interpret this result for the control group as a unanimous lack of satisfaction with the unchanged wording of the feedback they received."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "A large majority of patients with diabetes are resistant to the usual recommendations for physical activity that they receive."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Regular physical activity is known to be beneficial to people suffer-<lb>ing from diabetes type 2.
