Recent years have witnessed several major algorithmic advances in structure learning for Bayesian networks---arguably the most central class of graphical models---especially in what is known as the score-based setting. A successful generic approach to optimal Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL), based on integer programming (IP), is implemented in the GOBNILP system. Despite the recent algorithmic advances, current understanding of foundational aspects underlying the IP based approach to BNSL is still somewhat lacking. Understanding fundamental aspects of cutting planes and the related separation problem( is important not only from a purely theoretical perspective, but also since it holds out the promise of further improving the efficiency of state-of-the-art approaches to solving BNSL exactly. In this paper, we make several theoretical contributions towards these goals: (i) we study the computational complexity of the separation problem, proving that the problem is NP-hard; (ii) we formalise and analyse the relationship between three key polytopes underlying the IP-based approach to BNSL; (iii) we study the facets of the three polytopes both from the theoretical and practical perspective, providing, via exhaustive computation, a complete enumeration of facets for low-dimensional family-variable polytopes; and, furthermore, (iv) we establish a tight connection of the BNSL problem to the acyclic subgraph problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 May 2016 07:27:03 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04071v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 18 Dec 2016 17:28:15 GMT  (144kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04071v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["james cussens", "matti j\\\"arvisalo", "janne h korhonen", "mark bartlett"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04071"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.04071.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Bayesian Network Structure Learning with Integer Programming: Polytopes, Facets, and Complexity", "authors": ["James Cussens", "Matti J\u00e4rvisalo", "Janne H.

A Bayesian network consists of a structure and parameters. \u2022 The structure is an acyclic digraph (V, B) above set V with directed edges B. The structure defines the conditional dependencies between the variables in V; for edge i-j-B we say that i is a child of j and j is a parent of i, and for a variable i-V we denote the set of parents of i by Pa (i, B). \u2022 The parameters define a distribution for each of the random variables i-V stating the parents Pa (i, B), that is, the probabilities Pr (i | Pa (i, B). As mentioned above, our focus is on learning Bayesian networks from data. Specifically, we focus on the Bayesian problem of learning the network structure (BNSL), because once a BN structure is decided, the parameters can be learned from the simple way."}, {"heading": "2.2 Score-based BNSL", "text": "In the integer programming approach to BNSL, which is at the heart of this work, the learning problem is considered a limited optimization problem (SNP): each candidate BN structure has a score that measures how well it \"explains\" the given data and the task is to find a BN structure that maximizes that score. This score function is defined in terms of the data, but for our purposes it is sufficient to interpret the details away, see e.g. Koller and Friedman (2009).Specifically, in this paper we limit attention to decompatible score functions where the score is defined locally by parent selection."}, {"heading": "2.3 BNSL with Small Parent Sets", "text": "As already mentioned, it is customary to set an upper limit on the cardinality of the permitted parental rates. Specifically, a common attitude is that we have a constant upper limit and the BSNL instances we look at are so limited that all J-P instances (i), if they are small, are. For the rest of the paper, we use the convention that sets this upper limit. In practice, BNSL instances with a large node size can often be solved if they are small. Sheehan et al. (2014) we were able to solve BNSL instances with an upper limit of 1614 between 3 and 42 minutes. Although BNSL instances with a total size of 1 (Chickering, 1996) remain hard, such results suggest that the value of the BNSL instance is in practice an important determining hardness factor of a BNSL instance. However, we will show below that the situation is somewhat more substantial."}, {"heading": "3.

Recent years have witnessed several major algorithmic advances in structure learning for Bayesian networks\u2014arguably the most central class of graphical models\u2014especially in what is known as the score-based setting. A successful generic approach to optimal Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL), based on integer programming (IP), is implemented in the gobnilp system. Despite the recent algorithmic advances, current understanding of foundational aspects underlying the IP based approach to BNSL is still somewhat lacking. Understanding fundamental aspects of cutting planes and the related separation problem is important not only from a purely theoretical perspective, but also since it holds out the promise of further improving the efficiency of state-of-the-art approaches to solving BNSL exactly. In this paper, we make several theoretical contributions towards these goals: (i) we study the computational complexity of the separation problem, proving that the problem is NP-hard; (ii) we formalise and analyse the relationship between three key polytopes underlying the IP-based approach to BNSL; (iii) we study the facets of the three polytopes both from the theoretical and practical perspective, providing, via exhaustive computation, a complete enumeration of facets for low-dimensional family-variable polytopes; and, furthermore, (iv) we establish a tight connection of the BNSL problem to the acyclic subgraph problem.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
