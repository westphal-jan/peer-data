The similarity datasets that come from the two fields differ in design: psychological datasets are focused around a certain topic such as fruit names; linguistic datasets contain words from various categories. The later makes humans assign low similarity scores to the words that have nothing in common and to the words that have contrast in meaning, making similarity scores ambiguous. In this work we discuss the similarity collection procedure for a multi-category dataset that avoids score ambiguity and suggest changes to the evaluation procedure to reflect the insights of psychological literature for word, phrase and sentence similarity. We suggest to ask humans to provide a list of commonalities and differences instead of numerical similarity scores and employ the structure of human judgements beyond pairwise similarity. We believe that the proposed approach will give rise to datasets that test meaning representation models more thoroughly with respect to the human treatment of similarity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 May 2016 14:00:06 GMT  (25kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04553v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 16:55:20 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04553v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dmitrijs milajevs", "sascha griffiths"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04553"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.04553.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Proposal for Linguistic Similarity Datasets Based on Commonality Lists", "authors": ["Dmitrijs Milajevs"], "emails": ["d.milajevs@qmul.ac.uk", "s.griffiths@qmul.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 5.04 553v 2 [cs.C L] 17 Jun 20Similarity is a central term used in psychology and in two branches of linguistics: theoretical and computational. Similarity data sets originating from the two domains differ in design: psychological data sets focus on a specific topic, such as fruit names, while linguistic data sets contain words from different categories, the latter causing people to assign minor similarity values to words that have nothing in common and words that are contrasting in meaning, making similarity values ambiguous. In this paper, we discuss the process of collecting similarities for a multi-category data set that avoids ambiguities and proposes changes to the evaluation process in order to reflect the findings of psychological literature in terms of word, phrase and sentence similarity. We suggest that people be asked to provide a list of similarities and distinctions from numerical judgments of human judgments that we believe will yield more similarities in terms of the structure of human judgments than the ones proposed."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "It's not as if it's a way of putting people in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre, it's as if people are being put in the centre."}, {"heading": "2 Dataset Construction", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one is able to put oneself at the top without being able to trump oneself."}, {"heading": "3 Sentence Similarity", "text": "The question of sentence similarity is more complex because sentences are, in many ways, entities other than words. Or are they? Linguistics has lately often referred to a continuum that exists between words and sentences (Jackendoff, 2012). Jackendoff and Pinker (2005), for example, point out that there is good evidence that \"human memory must store linguistic expressions of all sizes.\" These linguistic expressions of varying sizes are often referred to as constructions. Several computational approaches to constructions have been suggested (Gaspers et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2012), but to the best knowledge of the authors, which they have so far been unable to measure the similarity of phrases and sentences within the proposed framework, we must be able to identify what could serve as commonalities between them. So, what are they? Words, sentences and other constructions draw attention to the states of things around us."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we discussed the concept of similarity from an interdisciplinary perspective. We compared the characteristics of the similarity relationship described in the field of psychology with the characteristics of similarity datasets used in computational linguistics, which led to recommendations on how to improve the later one by eliminating the ambiguity of low values in a multi-category similarity dataset. In the future, a multi-category similarity dataset should be built that allows the evaluation of meaning models in vector space by measuring not only the proximity between points, but also their arrangement in clusters. The same ideas can be used to build phrase and sentence comparison datasets, but we leave the exact selection of sentence similarity criteria for future work in this area. From a broader perspective, this work highlights psychological phenomena that are expected to be incorporated into models of meaning to improve their performance."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments.

The similarity datasets that come from the two fields differ in design: psychological datasets are focused around a certain topic such as fruit names, while linguistic datasets contain words from various categories. The later makes humans assign low similarity scores to the words that have nothing in common and to the words that have contrast in meaning, making similarity scores ambiguous. In this work we discuss the similarity collection procedure for a multi-category dataset that avoids score ambiguity and suggest changes to the evaluation procedure to reflect the insights of psychological literature for word, phrase and sentence similarity. We suggest to ask humans to provide a list of commonalities and differences instead of numerical similarity scores and employ the structure of human judgements beyond pairwise similarity for model evaluation. We believe that the proposed approach will give rise to datasets that test meaning representation models more thoroughly with respect to the human treatment of similarity.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
