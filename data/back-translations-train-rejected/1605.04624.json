SEARCH RANKING", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Expertise Homophily", "text": "One challenge in assessing the expertise of members is that many members do not explicitly list all the skills they have. To overcome this, we take a two-step approach (Figure 1). In the first step, we use a supervised learning algorithm that combines various signals on LinkedIn, such as the rank of qualification charts, the textual similarity of the skill profile, the seniority of members, etc., to estimate the competence values, i.e. p (expert | member, skill). After this step, the expert matrix (E0) is very sparse, as we only have certainty about the competence values for a small percentage of pairs. In the second step, we factorize the matrix in member and qualification matrices in K-dimensional latent space. Then we calculate the point product of the matrices to fill the \"unknown\" cells. The intuition for this can be represented in the form of sketches between members and skill matrices in K-dimensional space."}, {"heading": "2.2 Learning", "text": "In highly personalized settings such as LinkedIn searches, editorial judgement does not work well, as the relevance of the results depends heavily on the individual searcher. Labels derived from search logs that contain the searchers \"actions on the results are inherently personalized, however, the logs exhibit both position and selection distortions. To avoid position distortions, we collect labels from a small share of traffic that randomize the top K results. The marked data is then supplemented by simple negatives that are scanned from the tails of the rankings to reduce sample distortions."}, {"heading": "3. FEDERATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Overall Framework", "text": "When a member issues a query q, the query is forwarded to the vertical and triggers the corresponding vertical search engines to obtain the respective best K results. In the preliminary vertical selection phase, the allied scorer extracts characteristics and calculates a relevance value for each of the vertical ones. The top vertical is selected as primary and the rest as a candidate for secondary vertical. Subsequently, in the aggregation phase, these candidates compete with the individual results in the primary vertical to form the final ranking. Note that these candidates are not guaranteed to appear in the ranking. Instead, depending on the query, searchers and vertical results, all, some or none of these candidates could be selected. A critical feature used in the allied scorer is the intention of the seeker, which is described in the next section."}, {"heading": "3.2 Searcher Intent", "text": "Similarly, members who hire new employees should consider the work results more important. Considering this, we personalize the search federation by using the searcher's profile and past activities to derive their intentions. If a member's working title is a recruiter, he probably has a hiring intention. If a member has recently searched for work or applied for work, he probably has a job search intention. We train machine-learning models that combine all signals to predict the intentions of all searchers on a daily basis. It is worth noting that a member could have multiple intentions at the same time. The effects of intentions can vary considerably between different verticals. For example, knowing that a searcher has a job search intention is much more important for results that are jobs. We address this variation by capturing both intentions and result types. In the job function below, the job result is the same when the job search intention is activated and the results of all search intentions are weighted."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have described how vastly different intentions for the same search query emanating from different searchers make LinkedIn search unique, and outlined the approaches we use to personalize both vertical ranking and association to provide all of our searchers with a relevant experience."}, {"heading": "5.
