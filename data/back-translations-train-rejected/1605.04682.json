In each section, we outline the achievements and limitations of existing work, leading to the formulation of the research questions proposed in the introduction."}, {"heading": "2.1 Scheduling Decision Support", "text": "Planning problems come in many forms and have attracted thousands of research papers dealing with different solutions to support decision-making in the real world. To structure this extensive research, several comprehensive literature reviews have been conducted. In their well-established surveys, Allahverdi et al. (1999; 2008) classify planning problems into those that take set-up times (costs) into account and those that do not. Problems of the former type are further classified by the dimensions single machine / parallel machine, batch / non-batch and sequence-dependent / sequence-independent set-up times. On the basis of this classification, the planning problem that is considered in this paper is a generalization of the problem class parallel machine planning on unrelated machines, non-batch sequence-dependent set-up times and an overall weighted production time-objective function. To be more precise, the problem class formulated in the literature is more restrictive than our problem () in the sense that in the earlier problem class, the set-up times are independent of the machine and in each environment."}, {"heading": "2.2 Exact Algorithms", "text": "The study by Li and Yang (2009) lists two articles with exact algorithms for solving the problem (without taking set-up times into account), which are capable of solving small instances with 25 jobs and 2 machines in less than 15 minutes (Azizoglu and Kirca 1999) and medium instances with 100 jobs and 20 machines in less than one hour (Chen and Powell 1999). Lopes and de Carvalho (2007) presented a b & p strategy for solving parallel machine scheduling problems on unconnected machines with sequential (but not machine) dependent set-up times, release dates, due dates and an overall weighted objective delay function. Their algorithm is capable of solving instances with 150 jobs and 50 machines in less than one hour. Another approach is to model our scheduling problem as a square literature program and solve it using X-ray analysis."}, {"heading": "2.3 Heuristics", "text": "Regarding parallel machine planning on unrelated machines with non-batch sequence-dependent set-up times, there are few publications that develop solution euristics (Lin and Ying 2014). Kim et al. (2002) and Low (2005) use simulated annealing to minimize total delay and total flow time, while Vallada and Ruiz (2011) minimize macespan using a genetic algorithm. A taboo search to minimize total delay, total weighted delay, maximum delay and maximum latency was introduced by Chen (2006), Chen and Wu (2006), Kim and Shin (2003) and Logendran et al. (2007). Rabadi et al. (2006) introduced a randomized priority search to minimize metaheuristic macespan (2006), while de Paula et al. (2007) submitted a variable neighborhood search to minimize the sum of the macespan and total problem."}, {"heading": "2.4 High Performance Computing", "text": "HPC is used in many scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, geology, weather forecasting, aerodynamic research and computer science (Bell and Gray 2002; Vecchiola et al. 2009), but to the best of our knowledge, opportunities for modern parallel hardware architectures have been largely ignored in the planning process. Although HPC has become an integral part of several academic disciplines in recent decades, there is no generally accepted definition of what HPC actually is. HPC implicitly refers to the use of parallel hardware architectures, which consist of a normally large number of interconnected multi-core processors (nodes).The particular relevance of parallel computing architectures lies in limiting speed improvement to a single core for technological reasons (Hager and Wellein 2010).At the extreme of HPC, supercomputers operating at or near the current highest operating rate for computers are used."}, {"heading": "3 Scheduling Model and Parallel Depth-First Search Heuristic", "text": "In this section, we formulate the disposition problem using a mathematical optimization model and present heuristics to achieve high-quality solutions. Finally, we present our parallelization concept for the proposed heuristics."}, {"heading": "3.1 Problem Formulation", "text": "In this section, we present a mathematical formulation of our disposition problem, which includes orders that need to be processed on exactly one machine. Allow the set of all feasible dispositions on the machine, be it the number of intermined orders, or the weighted total completion time of the disposition plan on the machine. A decision variable is whether the schedule is used on the machine or not. The dispositioning problem can then be formulated using the following binary linear optimization model. In the literature, different formulations are proposed, see Li and Yang (2009) for an overview; the method chosen has proven to be particularly suitable for industry and pricing algorithms (Chen and Powell 1999; Chen and Powell 2003; Lopes and de Carvalho 2007; van den Akker et al. 1999)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Depth-First Search Heuristic", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to survive on our own."}, {"heading": "3.3 Parallelization of the DFS Heuristic", "text": "There are two possible ways to speed up the execution speed of DFS."}, {"heading": "4 Computational Experiments", "text": "Our experiments were conducted on a Linux-based computing cluster consisting of multiple networked computing nodes, each node represented by a dual-socket Intel Westmere X5675 shared memory system with 6 cores per socket and a clock speed of 3.07 GHz, a standard architecture in modern high-performance systems (Hager and Wellein 2010), the algorithm was encoded in C + +, and the limited linear programs during column generation were performed using the GUROBI 6.0 C + + API. We randomly generated ten instances for each of the instance sizes 300 / 300, 300 / 100, 300 / 75, 300 / 60, 300 / 45 and 300 / 30, with n / m representing a setting with n jobs and m machines, to gain insights into how DFS heuristics works and how parallelization works for different ratios of n to m. The processing times in our experiments in 2001 are uniformly distributed across the job times and im of 1999."}, {"heading": "5 Results and Discussion", "text": "In this section, we present and evaluate our results. We discuss the effectiveness of DFS heuristics and their efficiency. Finally, we present our results for parallel implementation."}, {"heading": "5.1 Effectiveness of the DFS Heuristic", "text": "For each case we calculated the solution of the DFS heuristics and the best performing heuristics of Weng et al. (2001) and Wex et al. (2014) - we call these heuristics SCHED - and documented execution times as well as the solution quality (see paragraph 2.3). The pseudo-code of SCHED heuristics is shown in Table 6. Let us name the set of all pairs in which machines are eligible for a processing task. The average gaps between the heuristic solutions of DFS and (1) the best lower limits (at the time of termination of the algorithm) and (2) the solutions of SCHED heuristics are used in the literature, e.g. by Wex et al. (2014) and Schryen et al. (2015), and allow the quantification of the solution quality of DFS in comparison to (1) optimal solutions and (2) SCHED heuristics. The gaps are indeed the upper margin of the effective gap between the S-36% and the extremely effective solutions in the DFS compared to the solutions."}, {"heading": "5.2 Efficiency of the DFS Heuristic", "text": "DFS heuristics calculated the solutions in less than 5 minutes, even in a purely serial execution mode. The average runtimes for each ratio n / m are shown in Figure 2. While the runtimes of DFS heuristics seem to increase superlinearly, the runtimes of SCHED heuristics in all tested instances were less than one second. The superlinear extension of the execution time of DFS is a disadvantage compared to SCHED. However, the execution times for our tested instance variables are at an acceptable level, as the algorithm ends within a few minutes."}, {"heading": "5.3 Impact of HPC", "text": "The parallel implementation of our algorithm has been tested on various configurations - 1, 6, and 12 threads on 1, 3, and 5 processes. This implementation is capable of significantly reducing runtimes for each of the instance variables. Figure 3 shows the reduction in execution time with an increasing number of threads on a process. Let's call it the purely serial part of a program. HPC's effect has been evaluated using an established scalability metric - comparing theoretical and observed parallel acceleration on a process and multiple threads (Hager and Wellein 2010). Theoretical acceleration by threads can then be calculated as. Note that this is known as the Amdahl Act (Amdahl 1967). Table 8 lists the theoretical and observed accelerations for all instance variables and shows that our parallelization reaches the runtimes of nodes that are only slightly below the theoretical limits."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we formulate a new heuristics for the NP schema problem. Heuristics are based on a branch-and-price algorithm and use a lazy schema strategy. We have shown that the proposed heuristics can solve large problem cases with 300 workstations in less than five minutes, even in serial execution of the algorithm. In addition, our heuristic approaches, which differ only marginally from the optimal solution - 0.71% in the worst of all 70 tested scenarios. The solutions were compared with an established solution and the results show that this heuristics can be improved by an average of 11.35% in the most difficult instance size, resulting in a high potential to save costs and time in practical application."}, {"heading": "7 References", "text": "\"Allahverdi, A., Gupta, J.N.D., and Aldowaisan, T. 1999\" A Review of Scheduling Research Involving Setup Considerations, \"Omega (27: 2), pp 219-239.
