In this section, we recall the rules of gg and some of the assumptions that can be made on the input curve while respecting the PSPACE completeness."}, {"heading": "2.1. Generalized Geography", "text": "In gg, players take turns taking a mean degree from vertex to vertex in a given chart. If the token is on a vertex v, then it can be moved to a vertex v \"Neighbor v,\" if v \"has not yet been visited. A player wins when his opponent's turn is on and the opponent has no legal moves. An instance of gg is a diagram G and an initial vertex v0, and asks if the first player has a winning strategy in the corresponding game. We call the theorem the precursor of the vertex v in G, and S (v) the series of successors of v.\" A vertex with in-degree i and out-degree o is called. The degree of a vertex is the sum of the in-degree and out-degree, and the degree of G is the degree we assume the degree of G is the degree below all the vertex of G.

To win, a player must connect a certain pair of opposite sides of the parallelogram, and the other player must connect the other pair of opposite sides. As an example, Figure 2 reproduces a hexagonal puzzle from the diagram by the theoretician Claude Berge, as quoted by Hayward and van Rijswijck [34]. In section 6.1, we will see that a game cannot be drawn."}, {"heading": "3.

Twixt", "text": "It was invented around 1960 and was marketed as soon as 1962. In his book devoted to connecting games, Cameron Browne describes twixt as one of the most popular and widely marketed of all connecting games [2]. We now briefly describe the rules of twixt and refer to Moesker's master's thesis for an introduction and a mathematical approach to strategy, and the description of a possible implementation [24].twixt is a two-player connecting game played on a go-like board. In their turn, players White and Black place a pawn of their color in an unoccupied place. Just as in havannah and hex, the pawns cannot be taken, nor removed. If two pawns of the same color are suspended from a knight's move, they are joined by an edge of their color, unless that edge would cross another edge."}, {"heading": "3.2. Slither", "text": "Slither, invented by Corey Clark in 2010, is a relatively new connecting game with increasing popularity among online board players. Unlike Hex and Havannah, which are played on a hexagonal paved board, Slither is played on a grid and each player attempts to connect a pair of opposing edges corresponding to their color by constructing connected groups of tiles. While most other connecting games are just about placing a new element on the board, moves in the slither also allow for moving already played tiles. Another important difference between common connecting games and slither is that some stone configurations are prohibited in the latter."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Rules", "text": "This is a two-player game that begins with an empty grid (or board). Let's call the players Black (or B) and White (or W). Black and White alternate. Before specifying what a move consists of and what the winning conditions are, we introduce some useful definitions. As the game progresses, squares on the board may be empty or contain a black tile or contain a white tile. We refer to black (or white) tiles as player B (or W) tiles. We say that two squares on the board are adjacent if they are in the same row and contain adjacent columns, or in the same column and adjacent rows. They are king-adjacent tiles if a chess king can move from one square to another, and are diagonally adjacent tiles if they are king-adjacent, if they are king-adjacent but not."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Computational complexity", "text": "Here we show that the decision whether a player has a winning strategy from a certain position cannot move into a cell in a white cell. Again, we present a reduction of Hex. A hexagonal cell of Hex is encoded by the gadgets shown in Figure 8. More specifically, containing an empty cell with an empty cell, or a white stone, is transformed into the part of the position of Figure 8a (resp. Figure 8b, resp. Figure 8c).Observation 1. If a player pushes only one stone into an empty square of the empty cell, they create a configuration that is prohibited by the diagonal rule. Therefore, they must also move one of their stones into the same cell. Lemma 1. In a black cell C (Figure 8b), White cannot prevent a group of stones in x, y and currently Proof Black stones on x."}, {"heading": "4. Complexity of Havannah", "text": "Havannah is a two-player connecting game played on a hexagonal board paved with hexagons. White and black place a stone of their color alternately in an unoccupied cell. Stones cannot be taken, moved or removed. Two cells are neighbors if they share an edge. A group is an associated component of stones of the same color over the neighboring relationship. A player wins when he recognizes one of the three following distinct structures: a circular group called a ring, with at least one cell, possibly empty, inside; a group that connects two corners of the board, called a bridge; or a group that connects three edges of the board, called a fork."}, {"heading": "4.1.

Vertex gadgets", "text": "Let us remember from Section 2.1 that simplified gg instances have only four types of vertices: (1, 1), (2, 1), (0, 2) and (1, 2) vertices. Figure 11 shows how these four types of vertices are mapped in havannah gadgets. Diagrams illustrate the white version of the gadgets, according to the vertices belonging to the first player in gg. Each gadget can of course be rotated by a multiple of 60 \u0445, and the colors can be swapped to keep the black gadgets.In Figure 11d and 11c, after black plays n, white can choose to play c1 or c2. In the first case, black is forced to answer c2, forcing white to leave the gadget via x1. In the second case, black responds to c1 and then white leaves the gadget via x2.Let (G, v0) a simplified instance of gg."}, {"heading": "4.3.

Parameterized Complexity of Short Generalized Hex", "text": "In all cases, it can be assumed that the initial white vertex is already able to form a generalized hex plane, since it generalizes the hexagonal tiles to any (potentially non-planar) graph. A generalized hex instance is a graph G with two specified vertices s and t, each containing a white pebble. White (player 1) and Black (player 2), if they do not. If a black pebble is played in a vertex, one can imagine the equivalent of this vertex being removed from the graph. Any edge that has a white pebble at its two ends can be contracted equally to a single vertex that contains a white pebble."}, {"heading": "6. Ultra-weak Solutions of Connection games", "text": "In Allis \"Hierarchy of Game Solutions [46, Section 1.5], a game is called ultra-weak when the theoretical value of the starting position is determined. Hex is unusual among strategy games in that an ultra-weak solution is known for every board size. In this section, we first remember how hexagon can be solved ultra-weakly to prove that the starting position is a theoretical first-player gain. We then look at Twixt, Havannah and Slither and show that, despite some arguments, it is impossible to solve these games ultra-weakly using the same method."}, {"heading": "6.1.
