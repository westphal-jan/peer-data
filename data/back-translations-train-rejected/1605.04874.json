Among these methods, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as one of the best time-frequency method has been used for both stationary and transitory signals. Some deficiencies of CWT are problem of overlapping and distortion ofsignals. In this condition, a large amount of redundant information exists so that it may cause false alarm or misinterpretation of the operator. In this paper a modified method called Exact Wavelet Analysis is used to minimize the effects of overlapping and distortion in case of gearbox faults. To implement exact wavelet analysis, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used for this purpose. This method have been implemented for the acceleration signals from 2D acceleration sensor acquired by Advantech PCI-1710 card from a gearbox test setup in Amirkabir University of Technology. Gearbox has been considered in both healthy and chipped tooth gears conditions. Kernelized Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis functions has used the extracted features from exact wavelet analysis for classification. The efficiency of this classifier is then evaluated with the other signals acquired from the setup test. The results show that in comparison of CWT, PSO Exact Wavelet Transform has better ability in feature extraction in price of more computational effort. In addition, PSO exact wavelet has better speed comparing to Genetic Algorithm (GA) exact wavelet in condition of equal population because of factoring mutation and crossover in PSO algorithm. SVM classifier with the extracted features in gearbox shows very good results and its ability has been proved.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 May 2016 23:29:29 GMT  (2811kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04874v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["amir hosein zamanian", "abdolreza ohadi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04874"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.04874.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Gearbox Fault Detection through PSO Exact Wavelet Analysis and SVM Classifier", "authors": ["Amir Hosein Zamanian", "Abdolreza Ohadi"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "Exact Wavelet Analysis", "text": "There are two types of accurate wave analysis, the first method uses the concept of the \"maximum adaptation mechanism\" to determine the most suitable coefficients for the tube under investigation.

The advantage of this method is its simplicity and higher computing speed, whereas its disadvantages indicate the fact that it is not able to find the shape of the investigated signal."}, {"heading": "Particle Swarm Optimization", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate until it is able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "Experimental Results", "text": "To evaluate the efficiency of the exact wavelengths, the algorithm was implemented on an experimental vibration signal of the gearbox. This process was performed for two conditions, normal and chipped gears (as shown in Fig. 3). In the chipped tooth case, 50% of a tooth profile from top to bottom circle (addition) was eliminated using linear slop from top to bottom circle. Signals were developed by a gear setup test at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) for this suggests, as shown in Fig. 5. Vibration signals were obtained from 2D accelerometers (ADXL210JQC) mounted on gear frame (Fig. 4). Sampling frequency was set as 10 kHz. Acceleration frequency is in the range of 0 ~ 5kHz. These received signals were passed to A / D converters."}, {"heading": "100 94 100 99 100 100 100 100", "text": "Table 2 shows that the sets of characteristics are fully linearly separable, so the use of linear SVM brings 100% success in classification. Nonlinear SVM with RBF provide excellent classification when the parameter increases because SVM tends to be linear."}, {"heading": "Comparison of PSO and GA exact", "text": "The authors applied the exact GA wavelength, with similar parameters of the PSO, and the computing time was almost 40 times higher in the case of an exact GA wavelength analysis. GA solutions, however, had better optimization performance in finding the most suitable scale, and PSO generally filled local maxima. It should be noted that the PSO and GA solutions were close together and the difference in solution did not affect the feature extraction mentioned. The solution for 20 signal samples is shown in Fig. 7. Due to the stochastic nature of both GA and PSO methods, the solutions shown in Fig. 7 may change in different passes."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper presents a modified version of the exact wavelength analysis that accelerates the exact wavelength curve. It has been shown that the PSO-exact wavelength can speed up the process almost 40 times compared to GA. It is also shown that parameters of the exact wavelength can be reduced by using suitable wavelength (i.e. Morlet wavelength) to prevent the development of the wavelength. This acceleration accelerates without destroying characteristics. The SVM classifier was used with 16 characteristics, although SVM with radial bases with Test6 ISME2010, 11-13 May 2010 can classify the success of 100% by taking appropriate sigma into account, as shown in Table 1. However, it has been shown that the characteristics are linearly separable, so that linear SVM will be sufficient in the case of classification of normal and chipped gear. The main problem that is sufficient is the computational time, which cannot be used even with this modified in real time."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The authors should thank Mr. Mohammad Sarikhani, Instructor in Vibration and Dynamics of Machine Lab, Amirkabir University of Technology for his valuable advice and Mr. Mohammad Rostami Ghomi, MSc electronic student, Sharif University of Technology for developing some electronic devices for this project."}], "references": [{"title": "Gear fault detection using artificial neural networks and support vector machines with genetic algorithms", "author": ["B.
