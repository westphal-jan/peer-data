However, the 2011 earthquake in Japan, the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, and the 2015 Paris attacks are just three examples of an event in which Twitter played an important role in disseminating information. However, given the large amount of tweets generated during these events, it will be extremely difficult to understand all the information that is disseminated on Twitter. In this essay, we present a semi-automatic tool that combines state-of-the-art natural language processing and cluster algorithms in a novel way that allows users to efficiently and accurately identify stories that are disseminated on Twitter about specific events."}, {"heading": "What is an Assertion?", "text": "An assertion is a statement that binds the speaker to the truth of what is said. For example, the \"There is a third bomber on the roof\" tweet contains an assertion, while the \"I hate reporters!\" tweet does not contain an assertion (it does contain an expression). It has been shown that more than half of tweets about events do not contain assertions (Vosoughi and Roy 2016), so by filtering all non-assertion tweets, we can drastically reduce the number of tweets that need to be analyzed to detect stories."}, {"heading": "System Overview", "text": "An overview of the system can be found in Figure 1. The illustration shows the fully automated modules in blue, while the modules that require manual input are shown in green. Currently, the system only works on Twitter, although we plan to extend it to other publicly available social media platforms such as Reddit. The first module in the system is a standard Boolean query specified by the user. The purpose of this query is to limit the amount of data analyzed for an event. This query can be anything but optimal if it is a well-defined event. In this illustration, for example, the Boston AND Bombing query selects tweets about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. These tweets are then forwarded to the \"automatic\" parts of the system, an assertion detector module and a hierarchical clustering tool that captures these events."}, {"heading": "Detecting Assertions in Tweets", "text": "Assertions are a class of speech files. To detect assertions in tweets, we need a speech file classifier. Of the 7,000 tweets that contain assertions, we commented 7,000 tweets manually and the rest contained one of the other speech files. These tweets were used to train a state-of-the-art Twitter language actor classifier developed by Vosoughi et al. (Vosoughi and Roy 2016) (by breaking down all non-assertion classes into one class).We rated the classifier using a 20-fold cross-validation, with the F score for classifying assertions being 0.86. Its performance is better illustrated by its ROC curve in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "Hierarchical Clustering of Tweets", "text": "The next part in the automatic processing pipeline is the hierarchical clustering of semantically similar tweets to group tweets that make similar assertions; the output of hierarchical clustering is best described as dendrogram; at the lowest level of the dendrogram, all tweets belong to their own clusters; at the root of the tree, there is a single cluster that contains all tweets; users can explore the clusters at each level; a lower partition in the tree (further from the root) would result in more clusters, with each cluster containing fewer tweets; conversely, a higher partition in the tree would result in fewer clusters, with each containing more tweets; depending on the event, there could be thousands of clusters at different levels; it is up to users to decide how best to cut off and explore the clusters; for example, if it is a very local event, it means there are not many tweets about the event, then perhaps a higher hierarchical problem."}, {"heading": "Conventional Method", "text": "In general, there are two strategies for hierarchical clustering: \u2022 Agglomerative: This is a bottom-up approach; each observation begins in its own cluster, and cluster pairs are merged as you move up the hierarchy. \u2022 Separating: This is a \"top-down\" approach; all observations begin in a cluster, and splits are executed recursively as you move down the hierarchy. \u2022 The complexity of agglomerative clustering is polynomic at O (n3), while the complexity of divisive clustering is exponential at O (2n). Given the potentially large number of tweets about an event, given its lower complexity, we have decided to use hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC)."}, {"heading": "Novel Method", "text": "TF-IDF, combined with cosmic similarity, is usually a good method of measuring the similarity between documents. However, my tweets are short (140 characters), irregular text whose subject-related information can hardly be expressed by TF-IDF representations. An alternative method is to use a similarity metric adapted to this platform. Twitter Paraphrase Identification We are implementing the Twitter paraphrase method recently proposed by Asli Eyecioglu and Bill Keller (winner of SemEval-2015 in this category) to measure the similarity between tweets. This method is used to identify pairs of Twitter paraphrases, where paraphrase identification is defined as \"the task of deciding whether two predetermined text fragments have the same meaning.\" This method takes a pair of tweets and makes a binary judgement on whether these two tweets are paraphrases."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "Analysis 1 Because our system is semi-automatic, the evaluation is based on user-centered criteria to identify individuals: the accuracy and speed with which users can identify claims about a particular event on Twitter. To do this, we used snopes.com to identify multiple tweets (one rumor is an unverified claim) that had spread on Twitter for three different events: the 2013 Boston bombings (10 rumors), the 2011 Japanese earthquake (6 rumors), and the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris (5 rumors). We manually collected between 150 and 500 English-language tweets for each rumor. For each event, we also mixed in several hundred random tweets about the event that had nothing to do with the rumors (to mimic a real situation where there is a mix of tweets that contain rumors and tweets that do not contain). In total, there were 9,825 tweets about all three events (6,825 of one tweet about a rumor, one about a thousand and three random events)."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In this post, we introduced a semi-automatic tool that efficiently identifies stories about real-world events on Twitter. This is an important problem because Twitter and other social media platforms have become one of the most important sources of news for many people. Faced with a custom query about an event, our tool automatically detects and bundles assertions about that event on Twitter. The system uses a Twitter language act classifier in conjunction with a novel hierarchical cluster method for tweets. Instead of relying on traditional hierarchical methods that do not work well in tweets, our method works by first creating a similarity curve of tweets (using recent advances in Twitter NLP tools) and then applying a very fast community recognition algorithm on the chart. Not only is the system faster, but it also provides higher-quality clusters (less loud and more coherent), making it easier for users to sort thousands of tweets quickly."}], "references": [{"title": "Multilevel local optimization of modularity.
