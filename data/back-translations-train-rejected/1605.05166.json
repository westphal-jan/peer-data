[2]. They use data from the Friend Finder system (which contains some private data) provided by different social networks to link users across services. Although one can achieve a relatively high degree of success by using private data to link user accounts, we are interested in using only publicly available data for this task. In fact, as already mentioned, we do not even consider publicly available information that could explicitly identify a user, such as names, birthdays and locations. [3] Several methods have been proposed to match user profiles with public data [11.26.16.27,9,7]. This work differs from ours in two main aspects. First, in some of these works the basic truth data is collected by assuming that all profiles that have the same screen name come from the same users [9,7]. This is not a valid assumption that accounts are almost identical to each other."}, {"heading": "3 Data Collection and Datasets", "text": "For the purposes of this work, we focused on matching accounts between two of the largest social networks: Twitter and Facebook. To continue our study, we needed a significant (several thousand) number of English-speaking users with accounts on both Twitter and Facebook. We also needed the precise matching between the Twitter and Facebook accounts for our basic truth. To this end, we combed through publicly accessible English-language Google Plus accounts using the Google Plus API 1 and scraped links to other users \"social media profiles. (Note that one of the reasons we used Twitter and Facebook for our basic truth is that they are two of the most common sites associated with Google Plus.) We used a third-party social media page (i.e. Google Plus), one that was not used in our analysis to compile our basic truth in order to limit bias in our data collection. We discarded any users who did not connect to an account for both Twitter and Facebook and whose accounts were not public on both Facebook and their accounts."}, {"heading": "4 Models", "text": "We developed several linguistic, temporal and combined temporal-linguistic models for our task. These models take as input a user, u, from one of the pages (i.e. Twitter or Facebook) and a list of N users from the other service, where one of the N users, u \u2032, is the same as u \u2032. The models then provide a ranking of candidate matches between u and each of the N users. We used two criteria to evaluate our models: 5 - Accuracy: Percentage of cases in which the best placed candidate of a model is u \u2032. - Average rank: the average rank of u \u2032 within the candidate list created by a model. A random selector would have an accuracy of 1 / N and an average rank of N / 2 (since u \u2032 can appear anywhere in the list of N elements)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Linguistic Models", "text": "A valuable information technology derived from distribution to other words is the way people use their language. (A speaker or author of the word choice depends on many factors, including the rules of grammar, news content, and stylistic considerations.) Most statistical language models do not attempt to compare the complete language generation processes, but rather seek a compact model that adequately explains the observed linguistic data. Probabilistic models of language assign probabilities to word sequences w1. w, \"and as such, the probability of a corpus can be used to adjust model parameters, such as the characterization of language."}, {"heading": "4.2 Temporal Models", "text": "Another valuable source of information when comparing user accounts is the activity patterns of users. A measure of activity is the time and intensity with which users use a social network or media site. All public social networks, including publicly available Twitter and Facebook data, provide this information. Previous research has shown that temporal information (and other contextual information, such as spatial information) is correlated with people's linguistic activities [18,25]. We have extracted the following discrete temporal characteristics from our corpus: month (12 containers), day of the month (31 containers), day of the week (7 containers) and hour (24 containers). We have chosen these characteristics to capture fine to rough temporal patterns of user activity. For example, commuting to work is a recurring pattern associated with a time of day, while paying bills is more closely tied to the day of the month, and holidays are more closely tied to the month."}, {"heading": "4.3 Combined Models", "text": "Finally, we created a combined temporal-linguistic model. As both the linguistic and temporal models were built using the same framework, it was relatively easy to combine the two models, and the combined model was created by merging the linguistic and temporal corpora and vocabulary. (Remember that we treated temporal characteristics as words) We then experimented with the same four methods as in the previous two sections to create our combined models.Table 4 shows the performance of each of these models. Across the world, the combined models exceeded their respective linguistic and temporal models, although the difference from the linguistic models was not as large. These results suggest that the temporal and linguistic \"styles\" of users do not provide overlapping clues about the identity of said users. Also, note that as with the linguistic and temporal models, 5 percent of the confusion model, the combined confusion model clearly exceeds the performance of the various combined models based on the 5 percent timeline."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation Against Humans", "text": "It is a task on an equal footing with the detection of plagiarism, something that an uneducated person (or sometimes 11 even a trained person) cannot easily accomplish. (Hence the need for the development of the field of stylimetry in the early Renaissance.) However, we wanted to evaluate our model against man to make sure that it actually surpasses him. We designed an experiment to compare the performance of human judges with our best model, the temporal-linguistic confusion model. The task had to be simple enough for human judges to try it with ease. For example, it would have been ridiculous to ask the judges to sort 11, 224 accounts into 5, 612 matching pairs. So we randomly selected 100 accounts from different users from our collection of 11, 224 accounts based on a single correct list of 10 candidate accounts was created for each of the 100 accounts."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "Motivated by the growing interest in synchronizing user accounts across various social media and networking sites, in this essay we presented models for digital styometry, which is a method for synchronizing users using stylometric inspired techniques. We used temporal and linguistic patterns of users to make the comparisons. We experimented with linguistic, temporal and combined temporal-linguistic models that used standard and novel techniques. Methods based on our novel confusion model outperformed the more common ones in all cases. We demonstrated that both temporal and linguistic information are useful to synchronize users, with the best temporal model working with an accuracy of.10 and the best linguistic model working with an accuracy of 0.27. Although the linguistic models far exceeded the temporal models when the temporal models were combined, we intersected both with an accuracy of 0.31 and with an accuracy of 0.31 linguistic information, the improvement in the temporal information is indicated by the performance of the combined temporal models although linguistic information becomes linguistic information."}], "references": [{"title": "A primer on statistical distributions", "author": ["N.
