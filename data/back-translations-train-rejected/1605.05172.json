Historical linguists use the comparison method (Trask, 1996) to postulate relationships between languages. In NLP, the automatic identification of cognates is associated with the task of determining whether two words originate from a common ancestor or not. There are at least two ways to achieve automatic identification of cognates. One possibility is to modify a well-known string alignment technique such as Longest Common Subsequence or Needleman Wish Algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) to differentiate the alignments (Kondrak, 2001; List, 2012). Weights are determined by the linguistic alignment techniques that have occurred in the language family."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "The mentioned for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green."}, {"heading": "3 Convolutional networks", "text": "This article is the first to apply Convolutionary Networks (ConvNets) to phonemes by treating each phoneme as a vector of binary-valued phonetic characteristics; this approach has the advantage that it does not require explicit features such as engineering, alignment, and a solid transition matrix; the approach requires cognancy declarations and phonetic descriptions of sounds used to transcribe words; the cognancy declarations can be derived from etymological dictionaries and the quality of the phonemes can be derived from Lachbrenner et al., 1998; and Maddieson, 1998. Collobert et al. (2011) proposed ConvNets for NLP tasks and have since been used for sentence classification (Kim, 2014; Johnson and Zhang, 2015; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015); the part-language tagging (Santos and Zadrozny, 2014); and the information restoration (Santos, 2014) that the network is constituted (Kim and Kim)."}, {"heading": "4 Character convolutional networks", "text": "Chopra et al. (2005) expanded the traditional ConvNets to classify whether two images belong to the same person. These ConvNets are known as Siamese networks (inspired by Siamese twins) and have common weights for independent but identical layers of revolutionary networks. Siamese networks and their variants were used to detect whether two images are from the same person or different persons (Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2015); and to detect whether two language segments belong to the same word class (Kamper et al., 2015)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Word as image", "text": "Historical linguists perform an appropriate identification on the basis of regular correspondence described as changes in phonetic properties of phonemes. For example, Grimm's law bh \u0445 b is described as a loss of aspiration; p \u0445 f as a change from plosives to fricatives; and the devoicing d \u0445 t in English ten x Latin December. Learning criteria for cognancy through phonetic features from a series of training examples imply that there is no need for explicit alignment and design / learning of tone rating matrices. In this article, we present each phoneme as a binary vector of phonetic features and then perform folds on the two-dimensional matrix."}, {"heading": "4.2 Siamese network", "text": "Intuitively, a network should learn a similarity function so that words that differ due to responsible sound shifts are closer to each other than two words that are not related, and Siamese networks are suitable for this task because they learn a similarity function that is more similar between relatives than between non-relatives. Weight binding ensures that two related words that have similar phonetic characteristics in a local context tend to get higher weights than words that are not related."}, {"heading": "4.3 Phoneme vectorization", "text": "In this article we work with the ASJP alphabet (Brown et al., 2013). The ASJP alphabet is coarser than IPA, but was developed with the aim of capturing high frequency sounds in the languages of the world. ASJP database has word lists for 60% of the languages of the world, but has judgments only for some selected families (Wichmann and Holman, 2013).We have a binary vector for each phoneme based on the description in Table 1. In total, there are 16 binary value characteristics. In addition, we reduced all vowels to a single vowel, which has a value of 1 for the vocal function and 0 for the rest of the characteristics. The main motivation for this decision is that vowels are diachronically unstable as consonants (Kessler, 2007).A word such as \"bold\" would be represented as a matrix, with each column providing a binary value for the phonetic function (see Table 2)."}, {"heading": "4.4 ConvNet Models", "text": "In this subsection we describe the ConvNet models that are used in our experiments.Siamese ConvNet Siamese networks refer to two similar networks that have a pair of inputs and minimize the distance between the initial representations. Each branch of the Siamese network consists of a Convolutionary network. The Euclidean distance D between the representations of each branch is then used to create a contrastive loss function yD + (1 \u2212 y) max {0, m \u2212 D} where m is the edge and y is the true label. We only describe the architecture as this is the basis for the rest of our experiments with Siamese architecture.1Manhattan Siamese ConvNet ConvNet is also a Siamese network in which the Euclidean distance is replaced by an elementary absolute difference layer followed by a fully con-1The results were slightly better than a majority classifier and were not reported in the articulated layer."}, {"heading": "5 Comparison methods", "text": "We compare the ConvNet architectures with SVM classifiers, which have been designed with different string similarities as characteristics. Other sound classes / alphabets Apart from the ASJP alphabet, there are two other alphabets designed by historical linguists for the purpose of modelling sound alterations.As mentioned earlier, the main idea behind designing sound classes is to prevent transitions between particular classes of sounds, but to allow transitions within a sound class.Dolgopolsky (1986) proposed a tenfold sound class system based on empirical data from 140 languages. SCA alphabet (List, 2012) has a size of 25 and tries to address some problems with the ASJP alphabet (lack of tones) and also to expand Dolgopolsky's sound classes based on evidence from more languages.Orthographic measures as characteristics we have converted all data sets into the three sound classes."}, {"heading": "6 Datasets", "text": "In this section we describe the datasets used in our experiments."}, {"heading": "7 Results", "text": "In this section we report on the results of our cross concepts and cross-family experiments. SVM training and evaluation metrics We used a linear kernel and optimized the SVM hyperparameter (C) by ten-fold cross validation and grid search on the training data. We report on accuracies, class-by-class F scores (positive and negative), combined F score and average precision values for each system on concept data sets in Table 4. The average precision value corresponds to the range below the precision call curve and is an indicator of the model's robustness against thresholds."}, {"heading": "7.1 Cross-Concept experiments", "text": "We observed that both the depth and width of the fully connected layers did not affect the performance of the ConvNet models. We used a fully connected network of size 8 in all of our experiments. We increased the number of neurons from 8 to 64 in multiples of two and observed that increasing the number of neurons harms the performance of the system. Effects of the filter size Zhang and Wallace (2015) observed that the size of the filter patch can affect the performance of the system. We experimented with different filter sizes of dimensions m \u00d7 k, where, m \u00b2 [1, 2] and k \u00b2 [1, 3]. We found no change in performance in concept experiments. We reported the results for m = 2, k = 3 filter sizes for cross-conceptual experiments."}, {"heading": "7.2 Cross-Family experiments", "text": "Effect of the filter size Unlike the previous experiment, the filter size has an impact on the performance of the ConvNet system. We observed that the best results were achieved with a filter size of 1 x 3. Due to its worse performance, the results of the 2-channel ConvNet were not taken into account in the task of cross-family identification. The results of our experiments are listed in Table 5."}, {"heading": "8 Discussion", "text": "Manhattan ConvNet performs better than PMI and orthographic models in terms of overall accuracy in all three language families. Manhattan ConvNet performs slightly better than the orthographic model in terms of averaged F scores and only performs worse than the other models in the Austronesian language family. Manhattan ConvNet performs poorly in the task of cross-family identification of relatives. Manhattan ConvNet does not perform as the best system in all evaluation metrics in a single language family. ConvNet performs better than PMI, but is not as good as orthographic measurements in the Indo-European language family. In terms of accuracy, ConvNet comes closer to PMI than the orthographic system. These experiments suggest that ConvNets can compete with a classifier trained on different orthographic measurements and different sound classes."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we explored the use of phonetic features of Convolutionary Networks for pairwise identification. Our experiments with Convolutionary Networks show that phonetic features can be used directly to classify whether two words are related or not. In the future, we intend to work directly with voice recordings and incorporate language reference information into ConvNets to improve performance. We are currently working on building a larger database of word lists in IPA transcription."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "I would like to thank Aparna Subhakari, Vijayaditya Peddinti, Johann-Mattis List, Johannes Dellert, Armin Buch, C-ag-r\u0131 C-oeltekin, Gerhard Ja-ger and Danie \ufffd l de Kok for all useful comments.
