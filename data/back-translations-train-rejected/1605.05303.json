For this, we provide an extensive discussion of some general convergence points and an exploration of the relationship between the different tasks involved in the standard NLG system pipeline architecture and the most common fuzzy approaches used in linguistic summarization/description of data, such as fuzzy quantified statements, evaluation criteria or aggregation operators. Each individual discussion is illustrated with a related use case. Recent work made in the context of cross-fertilization of both research fields is also referenced. This paper encompasses general ideas that emerged as part of the PhD thesis \"Application of fuzzy sets in data-to-text systems\". It does not present a specific application or a formal approach, but rather discusses current high-level issues and potential usages of fuzzy sets (focused on linguistic summarization of data) in natural language generation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 May 2016 19:45:49 GMT  (1072kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05303v1", "Paper features: 16 pages, 2 tables, 13 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper features: 16 pages, 2 tables, 13 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["a ramos-soto", "a bugar\\'in", "s barro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.05303"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.05303.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Fuzzy Sets Across the Natural Language Generation Pipeline", "authors": ["A.

An Illustrative Use Case", "text": "Suppose there is a meteorological agency that distributes weather reports based on observational data from several meteorological sensor stations over 100 different locations in a given region. This agency is interested in automating the creation of reports, as this task requires a lot of analysis time and effort from meteorologists due to the high number of reports that need to be produced (one per location).A team of NLG experts is then tasked with developing a system that generates meteorological text reports. After a few preliminary interviews and studying some examples of parallel human-produced texts and corresponding data, the experts determine that the specifications provided by meteorologists are incomplete and inaccurate: in some cases there is no clear semantic definition of the linguistic terms used in the text generation process, and meteorologists seem to differ in their definitions."}, {"heading": "C. Across the NLG Pipeline", "text": "In fact, they will be able to come out on top."}, {"heading": "A. Additional remarks", "text": "We have explored how fuzzy sets and LDD can play an important role in bringing inaccuracies and uncertainty management into NLG systems. While they seem directly usable for content-related tasks, we have also explored how a structure-related task, such as aggregation, could in some cases also be addressed by fuzzy means. In this context, we would like to revisit the idea proposed by Kacprzyk and Zadroz Eny in [16] about creating new types of protocols [40], which was discussed in Sec. II. Although in this paper we do not describe structuring as an NLG task that could be directly addressed by LDD or blurred means, we believe that this could serve as an inspiration for designing richer protocols. While document structuring deals with the organization of content structures at higher levels, such as paragraphs, these sorting operations also have other forms of relationships between these messages (i.e. discourses between contrast, elaboration or narrative)."}, {"heading": "B. Evaluation of NLG systems using fuzzy approaches", "text": "The evaluation of NLG systems that involve uncertainty management by fuzzy sets will be another interesting scope of research, since the flexibility offered by these techniques implies that additional decisions need to be made (e.g. in the examples shown in Sections III-C1, III-C2 and III-C3).In order to evaluate all of these design decisions during the design and development of an NLG system, the concept of \"evaluation\" used in an LDD context is likely to be impractical, which opens up the possibility of including such an evaluation during the subsequent standard evaluation process of the system [42].In this context, we would like to distinguish the concept of \"evaluation\" used in an LDD context from the concept used in an NLG context. Traditionally, the evaluation of LDD approaches consists of the use of different criteria, such as the fulfillment degree or coverage, which are most suitable in the case of application Sec-III, which allow the most suitable algorithm to be used by the candidates."}, {"heading": "C. Terminology", "text": "Another problem that is indirectly related to the research issues examined here, but could well become a problem in the future, is the terminology used in the literature to refer to any discipline involved in the tasks described here. We have tried to maintain a clear distinction between LDD, NLG, and D2T here, and although the latter two terms are well established in terms of use, LDD has been renamed differently in the literature or used with different meanings. LDD was originally conceived as a \"linguistic summary of data\" [4] and this name is still used in many fuzzy research papers, which we believe well represents the purpose of the field that represents, but this terminology might confuse readers from other disciplines, since summary is a well-known discipline in NLG and NLP (general texts summarizing larger documents), which has absolutely nothing to do with LDDD. \"Other authors consider LDD to be an alternative approach to the NLG / DDD, and the fact that both are the most interesting ones to be understood as the DLG / DDDT idea."}, {"heading": "D. Conclusions", "text": "The use of fuzzy sets and linguistic descriptions of data to provide inaccuracy and uncertainty management in NLG systems is a promising line of research that, as we discussed in this paper, has many implications. Although these types of techniques seem to fit primarily into content-related tasks, the variety of problems associated with such tasks opens up many possibilities. In addition, even more structure-focused NLG tasks such as aggregation or document structuring will also benefit from fuzzy sets and LDD. Table II summarizes the most relevant potential applications of these techniques in NLG. Likewise, research into NLG systems will also help bring fuzzy sets and LDD closer to real-world applications in which uncertainty plays a key role. In this regard, one of the biggest challenges is adopting and adapting the empirical approaches that are normally taken during the design of NLG systems."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (grants TIN2014-56633-C3-1-R) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF / FEDER) and the Galician Ministry of Education (grants GRC2014 / 030 and CN2012 / 151).
