INTRODUCTION", "text": "Due to its belonging to the family of NP hard problems, it is very unlikely that there is an algorithm with adequate runtime that can solve the problem accurately. Therefore, heuristic approaches must be developed to solve all problems except the smallest size.Many methods have been proposed to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem. In this thesis, we are developing a new meta-heuristic algorithm, which we call the Enhanced Bees Algorithm. We are adapting this algorithm from another relatively young algorithm called the Bees Algorithm, which has been developed to solve continuous optimization problems.We show that the results obtained with the Enhanced Bees Algorithm compete with the best modern meta heuristics available for the Vehicle Routing Problem. In addition, the algorithm has a good runtime performance and delivers results within 2% of the optimal solution within 60 seconds. This makes the Enhanced Bees Algorithm suitable for use in real shipping scenarios, which often has an optimal waiting time of only a few hours or a few minutes."}, {"heading": "1.1 Content Outline", "text": "We begin by providing a summary of the problem, as well as providing the material necessary for understanding the Enhanced Bees algorithm.

Often, the context used is that of a fleet of vehicles delivering goods to a number of customers, although the problem can equally be applied in many different industries and scenarios (including non-logistical scenarios, such as microchip layout). The aim is to divide deliveries between vehicles and define a sequence in which each vehicle will take over its work, so that the distance covered by the vehicles is minimized and all pre-defined restrictions are met. In the classic version of the VRP, the restrictions to be met are: 1. Each vehicle must start and finish its route at the depot. 2. All goods must be delivered. 3. Goods can only be dropped for a single time and by a single vehicle."}, {"heading": "2.1. OVERVIEW 9", "text": "A solution for a given VRP instance can be presented as a family of routes designated by S. Each route itself is a sequence of customer visits carried out by a single vehicle, designated by R = [v1, v2,.., vk] so that vi-V and v1, vk = vd. Each customer has a demand di, i-C, and q is the maximum demand permitted for each route (i.e. its maximum capacity).The cost of the solution and the value we want to minimize are given by the following formula: \"R-S-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V\" (Ri \u2212 vd), \"Ri-S-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V"}, {"heading": "10 CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND", "text": "A number of related problems emerge from the VRP. These problems model other constraints that occur in real-world applications of the VRP. Classical problems include: VRP with time windows (VRPTW), which introduces a time window restriction for each customer within which the vehicle must arrive; VRP with multiple depots (MDVRP), where the vehicles are delivered from multiple points of departure; and the Pick-up and Delivery problem (PDP), where the goods are both picked up and delivered along the route (as a courier would do)."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 TSP Introduction and History", "text": "The VRP is a combination of two problems, which in themselves are already combinatingly difficult: the problem of the moving salesman (more precisely the problem of the moving salesman) and the problem of waste packaging. The problem of the moving salesman (TSP) can be informally defined as follows: if you specify n points on a map, you specify a path through the n points, so that each point is used only once and the total distance covered is minimized. The name of the problem, the moving salesman, comes from the classic example of the problem from the real world. A salesman is sent on a journey to visit n cities. He must select the order in which he visits the cities, so that he travels the smallest distance. Although the problem sounds easily solvable, in reality it is NP-hard. The most well-known exact algorithms for solving the TSP still require a running time of O (2n). Karp's famous paper, reducibility under comatorial problems, the whole explanation of the 1972 NP problem, is a Hamilton theory."}, {"heading": "2.1.

Their paper provided an exact method of solving a problem of 49 cities, for the time a large number of cities. Their algorithm used the cutting plane method to provide an exact solution.This approach inspired many subsequent approaches, and is still the foundation of algorithms that attempt to provide an exact solution.A generalization of the TSP is the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP), in which multiple tours are constructed (i.e. multiple vendors can be used to visit the cities).The pure MTSP can be trivially turned into a TSP, by directly connecting an additional problem with an additional P."}, {"heading": "12 CHAPTER 2.

The first classic Direct Tree Search results date back to Christolds and Ellison. Their 1969 paper provided the first branch and bound algorithm for accurately solving the problems of the VRP [10]. Unfortunately, its time and storage requirements were large enough to solve problems of up to 13 customers; this result was later improved by Christolds in 1976 by using another branch model, which enabled him to solve the problems of the VRP [10] accurately. Unfortunately, its time and storage requirements were large enough to solve problems of up to 13 customers. Christolds improved this result in 1976 by using another branch model, which enabled him to solve the problems of the VRP for up to 31 customers. Christofides, Mingozzi and Toth [11] provide a lower time-bound method to the RP, which is sufficient to provide the speed of the search tree."}, {"heading": "2.3.

These methods are not a guarantee of finding the best answer in the world, but are aimed at achieving approximately optimal solutions using algorithms with fast runtimes that are able to scale to large problem cases. Classical heuristics for the VRP can be divided into three families: constructive heuristics; two-phase heuristics, which in turn can be divided into two subfamilies, clusters first and then route and route first and then cluster; and finally improvement methods."}, {"heading": "2.3.1 Constructive Heuristics", "text": "Constructive heuristics builds a solution from the ground up. They typically offer a recipe for building each route so as to minimize the total cost of all routes. A trivial but intuitive constructive heuristics is the closest method, in which routes are built sequentially and at each step the customer who comes closest to the last routed customer is selected, which continues until the route reaches its maximum capacity, at which point a new route is started. In practice, the closest algorithm tends to produce poor results and is rarely used. An early and influential result was given by Clarke and Wright in their 1964 paper. In their paper, they present a heuristic extension of Dantzig and Ramser's earlier work, which has since become known as Clarke Wright Savings heuristically."}, {"heading": "2.3. CLASSIC HEURISTICS 15", "text": "If merging is permissible, we merge the routes Ri, Rj in such a way that R \u2032 = [v0,.., i, j,.., vk]. In the parallel version, the solution for the loop is repeated until no more feasible savings are merged. Clark Write Savings heuristic method was used to solve problems of up to 1000 customers with results that often lie within 10% of the optimal solution, using only 180 seconds of runtime. [52] The parallel version of the Clark Write Savings algorithm exceeds the sequential version in most cases [30] and is typically the only one method. The heuristic method has proven to be surprisingly adaptable and has been extended to deal with more specific vehicle routing problems where additional goals and limitations have to be taken into account."}, {"heading": "2.3.2 Two-phase Heuristics", "text": "s start with the cluster, the second subfamily of the route. One of the basic algorithms for this method is given to us by Gillett and Miller, who in 1974, in their paper [22], provided a new approach called the sweep algorithm, which popularized the two-phase approach, although a similar method was proposed by Wren in 1971 and then by Wren and Holliday in 1972. [54] This approach uses an initial cluster phase to group customers into a series of base routes, from where the routes are treated as separate TSP instances and optimized accordingly. Typically, the two-phase approach does not prescribe a method for solving the TSP and assumes that already developed TSP methods can be used."}, {"heading": "16 CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND", "text": "The sweep method is surprisingly effective and has shown that it solves several benchmark VRP problems within 2% to 9% of the most common solutions [52].Fisher and Jaikumars \"1981 paper [17] builds on the two-phase approach by providing a more complex cluster method, instead solving a general assignment problem to form the clusters. One limitation of their method is that the amount of vehicle routes must be determined in advance. Their method often results in results that are 1% to 2% better than the results produced by the classic sweep algorithm [52].Christofides, Mingozzi and Toth expanded this approach in [11] and proposed a method that uses a truncated and bound technique (similar to the Exact Method of Christofides).At each step, it builds up a collection of candidate routes for a specific customer, i.e."}, {"heading": "2.3. CLASSIC HEURISTICS 17", "text": "is asymptotically optimal [23]."}, {"heading": "2.3.3 Iterative Improvement Heuristics", "text": "Iterative improvement methods follow an approach in which an initial candidate solution is iteratively improved by applying an operation that improves the candidate solution, typically in a small way, many thousands of times. The operations used are usually simple and change only a small part of the candidate solution, such as the position of an individual customer or an edge within the solution. The solution approach, which can be reached by the current candidate solution, S, using an operator op, is known as S's neighborhood. Typically, Iterative improvement heuristics can be used to select a new solution S by scanning the entire neighborhood of S for the best possible improvement. If no improvement can be found, the heuristic solution ends. The initial candidate solution (i.e. the starting point of the algorithm) can be randomly selected or selected using another heuristic solution S. Constructive heuristics are typically used to bring about an improvement."}, {"heading": "18 CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND", "text": "There are a number of other operations suggested in the literature. Christofides and Eilon state in their work one of the earliest iterative improvement methods. [10] In the paper, they simply change to 2-opt to increase the number of edges removed from two to three - the operation is aptly called 3-opt. They found that their heuristic results are better than the 2-opt. In general, operations such as 3-opt remove the edges and then look for a more optimal recombination of the components O (ny), where the number of edges is removed. A profitable burden of research focuses on operations that reduce the amount of recombinations to be searched. Or-opt presents an operation that has become known as Or-opt [35]. Or-opt is a limited 3-opt. It seeks to shift all sets of 3 consecutive corners (the Or calls chains) so that an improvement is made."}, {"heading": "2.4 Meta-heuristics", "text": "Meta-heuristics is a broad collection of methods that make few or no assumptions about the nature of the problem to be solved. They provide a framework that makes it possible to model individual problems and \"integrate\" them into meta-heuristics. Typically, meta-heuristics takes an approach that first produces a candidate solution (or solutions) and then refines it iteratively towards the optimal solution. Intuitively, one can imagine that meta-heuristics searches the search space of a problem. Each iteration searches the neighborhood of the current candidate solution (s) in search of new candidate solutions that approach global optimism. One limitation of meta-heuristics is that it does not find an optimal (or even a good!) solution. Moreover, the theoretical foundations of what makes one meta-heuristics more effective than another are still badly underestimated in the coming years."}, {"heading": "2.4.1 Simulated Annealing", "text": "Simulated annealing is inspired by the annealing process used in metallurgy. The algorithm starts with a candidate solution (which can be randomly selected) and then moves to obvious solutions with a probability depending on the quality of the solution, and a global parameter T, which is reduced over the course of the algorithm. In classic implementations, the following formula is used to control the probability of a move: e \u2212 f (s \u00b2) \u2212 f (s) TWhere f (s) and f (s \u00b2) represent the solution quality of the current solution or the new solution. Similar to the metallurgy process, T represents the current temperature of the solution. Initially, T is set to a high value, freeing the algorithm from any local optima in which it might be trapped. It is then cooled down over the course of the algorithm, forcing the search to approach a solution."}, {"heading": "20 CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND", "text": "One of the first simulated annealing results for the VRP was given by Robust, Daganzo and Souleyrette [44]. They defined the search neighborhood as all the solutions that can be gained from the current solution by applying one of two operations: moving part of a route to another location within the same route or exchanging customers between routes. They tested their solution on some large real-world cases with up to 500 customers. They reported some successes with their approach, but since their test cases were unique, no direct comparison is possible. Osman has given the most well-known simulated annealing results for the VRP [36]. His algorithm expands many areas of the basic Simulated Annealing approach. The method starts with the Clark and Wright algorithms to generate a starting point. It defines his neighborhood as all candidate solutions that can be achieved by an operator using such an exchange, which he calls heat exchange."}, {"heading": "2.4.

Mutates (optional) endIn a classical genetic algorithm, each candidate is encoded as a binary string (i.e., the candidate solution is not fulfilled."}, {"heading": "22 CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND", "text": "The crossover operators are then designed to take into account the limitations of the VRP. Two crossover operators commonly used with combinatorial problems are the Order Crossover (OX) and the Edge Assembly Crossover (EAX). OX [34] works by selecting two intersections within each route; the sub-string between the two intersections is copied directly from the second parent to the offspring; likewise, the string outside the intersections is copied from the first parent to the offspring, but all duplicates are removed, potentially leaving a partial solution where not all customers have been routed; the partial solution is then repaired by inserting all unrouted customers into the child in the same order in which they appeared in the second section. Another common crossover operator is EAX. EAX was originally designed for the TSP, but was adapted by converting the cycles to the VRP by [32]."}, {"heading": "2.4.

GIDEON uses an approach inspired by the sweep method (an overview of the sweep method is included in Section 2.3.2). It builds routes by moving a clockwise beam centered in the depot around the geographical space surrounding the customer's locations. Customers are collected into candidate routes based on a set of parameters refined by the Genetic Algorithm. GIDEON uses the Genetic Algorithm to develop the parameters used by the algorithm, rather than working directly on the problem."}, {"heading": "24 CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND", "text": "More recently, however, there have been two promising applications of genetic algorithms to solve the VRP. Nagata [32] has adapted the EAX operator for use in the VRP. And Berger and Barkaoui have introduced a hybrid genetic algorithm called HGA-VRP in [6]. HGA-VRP adapts a design euristics for use as a crossover operator, the basic requirement being the selection of a set of routes from each parent that are close to each other. Customers are then removed from one parent and inserted into the second, using an operation inspired by Solomon's design euristics for VRPTW [48]. Both methods have achieved the best-known solution for a series of classic VRP benchmark instances by Christofides, Mingozzi and Toth [11] and are competitive with the best taboo search methods."}, {"heading": "2.4.3 Tabu Search", "text": "Tabu Search follows the general approach shared by many meta-heuristics; it iteratively improves a candidate solution by looking for improvements in the neighborhood of the current solution. Tabu Search starts with a candidate solution that can be generated randomly or using another heuristics. Unlike simulated annealing, the best improvement within the current neighborhood is always taken as the next step. This introduces the problem of cycling between candidate solutions. To overcome this taboo search introduces a list of solutions that are already investigated and prohibited as the next step (hence the name). The first instance in which Tabu Search is used for VRP is Willard [53]. Willard's approach took advantage of the fact that VRP instances can be converted into MTSP instances and solved. The algorithm uses a combination of simple vortex exchange and resettlement operations. Although opening the door for further research is not competitive, its results are not competitive with the best classical hayritics."}, {"heading": "2.4. META-HEURISTICS 25", "text": "The Toth and Vigo method has yielded many competitive results. Taillard has provided one of the most successful methods for solving the VRP in its taboo search method in [49].

A new aspect of Taillard's algorithm is its breakdown of the problem into sub-problems. Each problem is divided into regions, with a simple segmentation of the region centered around the depot (Taillard also offers an alternative approach to problems where customers are not evenly distributed around the depot."}, {"heading": "2.4.4 Large Neighbourhood Search", "text": "Large Neighbourhood Search (commonly known as LNS) was recently proposed by Shaw as heuristics [47]. Large Neighbourhood Search is a form of heuristics known as Very Large Scale Neighbourhood Search (VLSN) 2. Very Large Scale Neighbourhood Search is based on a simple premise; rather than looking within a neighborhood for solutions that can be achieved through a single (and typically quite grainy) process like 2-opt, it may be worth considering a much broader neighborhood - a neighborhood of candidate solutions that can be achieved by applying many simultaneous changes to a candidate solution. What sets this heuristics apart from others is that the neighborhoods under consideration are typically exponentially large, making them often unfeasible for search. Therefore, much attention is paid to providing methods that can successfully traverse these neighborhoods. 2LNS is somewhat confusing the name, as it is not a competing species and it is a VN."}, {"heading": "26 CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND", "text": "The basic procedure is as follows: Algorithm 3: Large Neighborhood Search = an initial solution while the termination condition is not met doxt = x destroy (xt) repair (xt) if it is better than the current solution thenx = xt ending Result: xIt starts by selecting a starting position. This can be done randomly or by using another heuristic one. Then, for each iteration of the algorithm, a new position is generated by destroying part of the candidate solution and then repairing it. If the new solution is better than the current solution, then it is selected as a new position. This continues until the termination conditions are met. Large Neighbourhood Search can be considered as a type of very large scale solution that is Neighbourhood Search because in each iteration the number of adjacent solutions is exponentially large based on the number of items removed."}, {"heading": "2.5.

Which function to use is selected for each iteration based on their previous performance. In this way, the algorithm adapts to use the most effective function for searching in the neighborhood. Ropke uses several destruction functions, using a simple random removal heuristic, Shaw's removal heuristic, and a worst removal heuristic, which removes the most expensive customers (in terms of this customer's contribution to the total cost of the route).

BACKGROUND", "text": "In the context of combinatorial optimization, these behaviors can be imitated and exploited.

In real life, ants first look for food, and once they have found a food source, they return to the colony, returning a pheromone trail. Other ants who then encounter the pheromone trail follow it with a probability depending on how strong (and therefore how old) the pheromone trail is. If they follow it and find food, they then return to the colony, strengthening the pheromone trail as well. The strength of the pheromone trail decreases over time, meaning that younger and shorter pheromone tracks, which do not take so long to traverse, attract more ants.

We present the CVRP on a weighted diagram, G = (V, E). The vertices of the diagram V represent all locations that can be visited, including each customer location and the location of the depot. For simplicity, we let vd denote the vertex that represents the depot, and we denote the amount of customers with C = {1, 2,.., n}. Thus, the quantity of vertices is given by V = vd, C.

It is more desirable that the algorithm delivers a reasonable quality result quickly (within 60 seconds) than that it delivers a better one but requires a longer turnaround time.

This algorithm is specifically designed for solving instances of the VRP, so that a direct representation has been chosen. The algorithm uses a fitness concept common in many meta-heuristics to describe the cost of the solution.The fitness function f () contains terms for the distance (i.e. cost) of the solution and penalties for breaking capacity and maximum route constraints."}, {"heading": "4.3.

An interesting aspect of the bee algorithm is that it covers a wide search area, minimizing the risk of getting stuck in a local optimum. It achieves this by examining many areas of the search area randomly (or in bee algorithm linguistic usage, \"scouting\") during its entire run. However, this approach is not suitable for hard combinatorial problems where a newly constructed 2-Specific is used: cij = \u221a (xj \u2212 xi) 2 + (yj \u2212 yi) 2 3Specifically we use: cij = (xj \u2212 xi) + (yj \u2212 yi)"}, {"heading": "42 CHAPTER 4.

The algorithm keeps a register of the current positions occupied by each bee. We use the current fitness, f (S), as a quick and easy representation of the current position of a bee 4. If a bee tries to occupy the same position as another bee (i.e. they share the same candidate solution), then the bee trying to occupy that position is forced to re-explore the neighborhood and find another position.4This obviously does not work in circumstances where there is a reasonable probability that two candidate solutions, Si and Sj, f (Sj)."}, {"heading": "44 CHAPTER 4. ALGORITHM", "text": "The enforcement of the requirement that each bee must occupy a unique position has two advantages: it forces diversification between bees and sites, thereby promoting a larger share of the search space to be explored; and it increases the likelihood of escaping a local optimum, since a bee trapped in the local optimum now forces the rest of the hive to explore alternative positions, a feature that has a similar intent and effect to the Taboo lists provided by Taboo Search.Another feature of the Enhanced Bees algorithm is the role that websites play in concentrating exploration on specific areas of the search space.

To overcome this limitation, we instead use an approach inspired by the use of a cooling plan through simulated annealing. Bees are initially evenly distributed among each si-S site, ensuring that each site is explored equally. Then, in each \u03bb period, we reduce the number of sites maintained so that S = S \u2212 sw, where sw is the site with the least fitness. We measure the fitness of each site based on the fitness of its best found position. This process continues until a single site is left.

In the destruction phase of the LNS, when used for the VRP, typically a portion of the customers is removed from the solution by selecting only those changes that are most likely to improve the solution. The destruction phase of the Enhanced Bees algorithm consists of two phases: a destruction phase and a repair phase. In the destruction phase of the LNS, typically a portion of the customers is removed from the solution.

For our purposes, we define in context that for any two customers vi, vj, vj, V, then either vi, vj are geographically close to each other (i.e. cij is small), or they share an adjacent position within the same route, R = [..., vi, vj,...].The rationale for removing related customers is that they are most likely to be exchanged profitably with each other.

However, only feasible solutions may be counted as definitive solutions sent back by the algorithm. The second technique we use is the adjustment of the number of insertion positions considered as part of the repair heuristics.

As this process expands the number of insert positions that are considered heuristic by the repair, it also serves to expand the neighborhood of solutions surrounding a candidate solution.

It is adapted from a fairly recent algorithm, the Bees Algorithm, which was developed for continuous optimisation problems. We show that the results obtained by the Enhanced Bees Algorithm are competitive with the best meta-heuristics available for the Vehicle Routing Problem\u2014it is able to achieve results that are within 0.5% of the optimal solution on a commonly used set of test instances. We show that the algorithm has good runtime performance, producing results within 2% of the optimal solution within 60 seconds, making it suitable for use within real world dispatch scenarios. Additionally, we provide a short history of well known results from the literature along with a detailed description of the foundational methods developed to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
