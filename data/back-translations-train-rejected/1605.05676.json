This can also be done with other methods, such as counting black cells. However, our method is general and does not use prior knowledge, such as the color of the cells to be counted. For us, this result is a necessary condition for further investigation. The second experiment shows that the degrees of freedom, which refer to spatio-temporal patterns with high EVIFPP, adapt over time to the changing configurations of the system, showing that EVIFPP is capable of solving metabolism and mobility problems. We expect the same to apply to the proof of integration in relation to each partition and therefore also to the integration itself. The third experiment shows that under a variation of the initial state the degrees of freedom leading to spa-temporal patterns are very fast."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Three criteria we expect from such agent representation were motivated by a thought experiment involving a dynamic system model of the biosphere, and the literature was reviewed in the light of these criteria, and we presented our current candidacy to identify intrinsic spatial and temporal patterns in Bayesian dynamic networks, which are the basic building blocks of our approach to agent representation, and we argued that this approach can deal with the three criteria for agent representation that we have established. Experimentally, we have tested this for a rough approximation to our more involved concept of integration, but the experimental results are currently inconclusive in terms of tracking structures that are actually relevant to agents, so we see the value of this work primarily as a contribution to the discussion of the fundamentals of artificial life."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Christoph Salge, Olaf Witkowski, Nicola Catenacci-Volpi, Julien Hubert, Nathaniel Virgo and Nicholas Guttenberg for discussions on this topic.
