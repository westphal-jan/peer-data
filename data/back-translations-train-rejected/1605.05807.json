We now show that a library L for a goal G can be compiled at the beginning of a STRIPS planning problem PL (G), so that a plan for G satisfies the observations O iff \u03c0 for PL (G). Equipped with this match, and by setting the cost of all measures in PL to zero, so that no plan in the library is excluded due to their cost, a plan in the library for G corresponds to the observations O iff G to the optimal goal set in the theory T = < PL, G, O >, a set that can be calculated from the observation of the O conversion by using a standard plan for the planning problems P \u2032 L (G)."}, {"heading": "Plan Libraries", "text": "As is standard, we take a library L for a target G as a rooted, ordered AND / OR graph, where each node is an AND node, an OR node, or a leaf.

The children of an AND node n are AND nodes or leaves, while the children of an AND node are OR nodes or leaves. The children of an AND node n can be partially ordered; we write n \u2032 < n \u2032 to express that child n \u2032 must come from n before child n \u2032.

If the library is acyclic, it is sufficient to set N to the depth of the graph to ensure completeness; otherwise, parameter N sets a limit on the number of derivatives.

The plans in the first two libraries share a considerable amount of activities, e.g. kicking the ball or running towards the general direction of the opposing team, which do not take place or hardly take place in plans submitted by the latter two libraries. In Figure 2, we show the plan library for the frontal attention task. In the experiments, we test which plan libraries are compatible with a sequence of observations derived from one of them.
