However, in buildings with low consumption, the influence of occupants \"behaviour due to its influence on energy consumption and indoor climate through interactions with building physics becomes a determining consumption factor. Therefore, it is important to take into account the behaviour of occupants when estimating energy consumption. For example, if the air quality is poor, occupants may decide to open windows or doors depending on the type of windows, but also on the activities or wishes of other occupants. A high-performance building should be efficient for a wide variety of uses."}, {"heading": "STATE OF THE ART", "text": "In the scientific community of building physics, there is a growing interest in the behavior of residents due to their importance in reducing energy waste in buildings (Andersen et al, 2009).Residents \"behavior can be studied from building physics to human biology, through sociology and psychology, to describe thermal, visual, and indoor air quality. In the literature, three types of approaches can be found: deterministic approaches based on predefined scenarios and behavioral rules; statistical approaches based on factual observations, such as surveys; and social modeling approaches that model cognitive and considered behavior patterns."}, {"heading": "DYNAMIC BAYESIAN NETWORKS AS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A GENERAL TOOL FOR HUMAN BEHAVIOUR MODELLING", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "CO-SIMULATION MECHANISM", "text": "This year, it is at an all-time high in the history of the European Union."}, {"heading": "MODELLING OCCUPANTS IN AN OFFICE SETTING", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to live, in which they are able to live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "PHYSICAL MODEL OF THE OFFICE SETTING", "text": "The aim of this model is to predict the concentration of carbon dioxide in the office as a function of the door opening.
