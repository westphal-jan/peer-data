Can behavior that we think of as intelligent be replicated on a machine? If so, what consequences could this have for society? And what does it tell us about ourselves as human beings? Besides being a long-running topic of philosophical reflection and science fiction, AI is also a well-established scientific research area. Many universities have AI research labs, usually housed in computer science departments. The feats accomplished in such research have generally been far more modest than those imagined in the movies. But over time, the gap between reality and fiction has been closing. For example, selfdriving cars are now a reality. And the world outside academia has taken notice. The commercial opportunities are endless and technology companies are in fierce competition over the top AI talent. Meanwhile, there is a growing popular worry about where this is all headed. Most of the technical progress on AI is reported at scientific conferences on the subject. These conferences have been running for decades and are attended by a steady community of devoted researchers. But in recent years they have also started to attract a broader mix of participants. At the 2016 conference in Phoenix, one speaker was more controversial than any other in recent memory: Nick Bostrom. While the audience consisted mostly of computer scientists, Bostrom is a philosopher who directs the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford. He recently made waves with his book Superintelligence [1]. In it, he contemplates the problem that we may soon build AI that broadly exceeds human capabilities, and considers what steps we can take now to ensure that the result will be in our best interest. A key concern is that of an \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d: if we are intelligent enough to build a machine more intelligent than ourselves, then, so the thinking goes, surely that machine in turn would be capable of building something even more intelligent, and so on. The phrase \u201ctechnological singularity\u201d is sometimes also used to describe such runaway intelligence. Will humanity be left in the dust? Will we be wiped out?
