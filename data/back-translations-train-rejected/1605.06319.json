Introduction", "text": "Similes are speaking figures that compare two objects through the use of specific connecting words (Harris and others, 2002), but where the comparison should not be taken literally (e.g. \"hladan k'o krastavac\" - as cool as a cucumber), they are often used as metaphors, but connecting words (such as \"like\" and \"like\") are used explicitly (Cooper, 1986; Niculae, 2013). In many languages, comparisons are considered an important building block of spoken language and are part of cultural heritage. In Serbian, for example, Vuk Karadz \"ic tries to collect comparisons, along with other short speaking figures in the XIX century (Karadz\" ic, \"1849). While some of the collected comparisons are still used (e.g.\" bela \"kao sneg\" - white as snow), some have evolved (e.g. \"gladan kao\" kurjak \"- hungry as a wolf.\""}, {"heading": "2. Method", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Method Overview", "text": "The methodology consists of four steps (see Figure 1): first, we collect the documents for editing; second, we edit these documents and extract all the comparisons; third, we use machine learning to distinguish comparisons from the other expressions that serve as comparisons; last, a human curator checks the data and corrects any errors. In addition, users of our crowdsourcing website can suggest new comparisons and help collect the comparisons that were not collected by the text mining pipeline; the curator manually checks them."}, {"heading": "2.2. Crawler", "text": "In order to collect texts from which comparisons can be made, we have developed a series of crawlers created for specific websites. The aim was to download all potentially significant texts from these websites, but to skip meaningless parts or parts where comparisons are unlikely, such as menus, headlines and footers. To do this, each crawler will only extract text that is within the div HTML tag with a specific ID. Crawlers will follow links on every page they visit, but not outside the domain of the site. We have developed separate crawlers for the following four domains: \u2022 laguna.rs - one of the largest book publishers with abstracts, reviews and parts of the books on their website; ar Xiv: 160 5.06 319v 1 [cs.C L] 20 May 201 6 \u2022 rastko.rs - a project aimed at creating a digital library of books and articles in Serbian that are considered cultural heritage; \u2022 a large forum - a public one for rape.com."}, {"heading": "2.3. Modelling and extracting candidate similes", "text": "There are two main categories of comparison in Serbian: \u2022 Adjective: adjective + connecting word (e.g. \"kao\") + Noun Phrase (e.g. \"lep kao cvet\" - beautiful as a flower) \u2022 Verbal: verb + connecting word (\"kao\") + Noun Phrase (e.g. \"radi kao konj\" - \"works like a horse\") 1http: / / scrapy.org / Both of these categories can be modelled by this expression: (V | A | V se) (kao | k \u2032 o) (NP) (1) A typical noun phrase consists of a noun word that together with zero or more dependencies of different types, such as kakakakaz, adjective phrases, nougens, krasen, or crystal phrases are available."}, {"heading": "2.4. Simile classifier", "text": "The model would find similarities such as \"radi kao konj\" (works like a horse), but it would also filter out terms such as \"radi kao pravnik\" (works as a lawyer), which is not a comparison, but rather specifies a person's profession. There is no lexical feature that would provide a clue that these two phrases are in any way different, and only semantics (and context) would distinguish the comparisons from other expressions. However, current publicly available tools for Serbian process phrases are not at the semantic level, so we decided to rely on a classifier and manual verification of the phrases by a terminating curator. From the original data, we have created a sufficient number of true positive and false positive examples that can be used for machine learning. (These data were used to create a machine learning classifier that can distinguish true similarities from other phrases that have the same characteristics."}, {"heading": "2.5. Curation interface", "text": "We have created a web portal4 to view, search and edit the data set collected from the previous steps. It has the following curating features: \u2022 View all currently curated comparisons, sorted alphabetically \u2022 Search for comparisons. Searches are carried out using the family tree for Serbian, so that comparisons that are not exactly in the same form in the database can be retrieved. As Serbian is highly inflexible, the goal was to store only one canonical instance (an inflection) of each comparison. For example, \"beo kao sneg\" (m), \"bela kao sneg\" (f) and \"belo kao sneg\" (n) (\"white as snow\") in three different grammatical genders - male, female, castrate) are treated as expressions by our search algorithm."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "The crewmen downloaded 40,239 documents from the web (see Table 1), using a semi-automated workflow, we extracted potential comparisons and checked them manually, and a total of 446 real comparisons were eventually harvested. A manual review of the data also revealed that there were about 5,000 false positives. Our classification approach proved useful in filtering out some of them - the results are presented in Table 2.2https: / / github.com / nikolamilosevic86 / SerbianStemmer3http: / / ezbirka.starisloveni.com / download.html4http: / ezbirka.starisloveni.com. We merged the comparisons obtained from the web with the corpus published by Vuk Karadz'ic (Karadz'ic, 1849), which has collected 333 comparisons. Interestingly, there was only a small overlap between the two comparisons."}, {"heading": "4. Summary", "text": "In this article, we present initial work on building a corpus of comparisons in Serbian and a methodology for semi-automatic comparison creation. We have started the process by editing a number of websites that are likely to feature a number of comparisons. The current corpus, with 852 comparisons to our knowledge, is the largest comparisons corpus in Serbian. We believe that by dismantling other comparison websites and using crowdsourcing, the corpus will grow and stay up to date. Nevertheless, the current methodology needs to be improved through the use of semantic resources (e.g. WordNet) and contextualization. The International Standard Language Resource Number (ISLRN) of the Serbian Simile Corpus is 534-837-568-404-3. It is freely available at http: / / www.ezbirka. starisloveni.com /. The comparison code can be found on Git5."}, {"heading": "5. References", "text": "Aasheim, I. (2012). A contrastive study of similes in En-glish and norwegian.
