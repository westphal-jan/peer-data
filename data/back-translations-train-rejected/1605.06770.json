Firstly, the parallel subtitle data and its corresponding monolingual movie script data are crawled and collected from Internet. Then tags such as speaker and discourse boundary from the script data are projected to its subtitle data via an information retrieval approach in order to map monolingual discourse to bilingual texts. We not only evaluate the mapping results, but also integrate speaker information into the translation. Experiments show our proposed method can achieve 81.79% and 98.64% accuracy on speaker and dialogue boundary annotation, and speaker-based language model adaptation can obtain around 0.5 BLEU points improvement in translation qualities. Finally, we publicly release around 100K parallel discourse data with manual speaker and dialogue boundary annotation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 May 2016 10:50:07 GMT  (401kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06770v1", "7 pages, 3 figures, LREC 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 3 figures, LREC 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["longyue wang", "xiaojun zhang", "zhaopeng tu", "y way", "qun liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.06770"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.06770.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Automatic Construction of Discourse Corpora for Dialogue Translation", "authors": ["Longyue Wang", "Xiaojun Zhang", "Zhaopeng Tu", "Andy Way", "Qun Liu"], "emails": ["qliu}@computing.dcu.ie,", "tu.zhaopeng@huawei.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Discourse Corpus, Dialogue, Machine Translation, Information Retrieval, Movie Script, Movie Subtitle"}, {"heading": "1.

Building A Parallel Dialogue Corpus", "text": "As mentioned earlier, our featured parallel dialogue corpus is extracted from bilingual movie / episode subtitles and monolingual scripts. We are expanding previous work on movie scripts to include scripts from TV series such as Friends. From IMSDb and SimplyScripts4 and the like, we searched movie / episode scripts. In addition, we have collected bilingual English subtitles from multiple audiovisual translations3 Available at http: / / www.imsdb.com. 4Available at http: / / www.simplyscripts.com. Web resources such as Shooter5 and Opensubtitles are collected. 6 Based on the hypothesis that both a script and a subtitle exist for the same movie or the same episode, the method can be described in a pipeline as follows: (1) For a monolingual movie / episode script, we identify dialog boundaries and speaker boundaries based on the format and subtitle of each movie or episode, the method can be described in a pipeline as follows: (1) For a monolingual movie / episode script, we identify dialogue boundaries and speaker boundaries based on the format and speaker structure of each script (2) and its subscript structure (2)."}, {"heading": "3.1. Script and Subtitle", "text": "Figure 1 shows a browser snapshot that illustrates an episode script layout of Friends. There are three types of information: speaker, shot / scene, and action information in the script. The speaker element (red ellipses) contains the corresponding character that says the utterance (s). For example, the keywords \"SCENE J\" and \"CUT TO:\" refer to the beginning and end of a dialog. The action (green frame) contains all additional information of a narrative nature and explains what happens in the scene. In this work, we focus on the first two types of information, but ignore the final one. Figure 2 is the corresponding bilingual subtitle of the script in Figure 1. Subtitles are often organized into two formats: Advanced SubStation Alpha (ASS) and SubRip (Chinese script), both of which we associate with one line."}, {"heading": "3.2.

Experiments and Results", "text": "For the dialogue corpus construction, we apply our methods to a ten-year sitcom Friends. We extract and process both scripts and subtitles from friends (described in Section 3.1) and then bridge them (described in Section 3.2) to build a dialogue corpus in the format of Figure 3. For data processing, we use the sentence splitter and the English toolkit and our internal Chinese segmentor (Wang et al., 2012b). In addition, we deal with indexing and search tasks. Table 1 presents the main statistics of the resulting bilingual dialogue corpus. We receive 5,428 bilingual dialogs with the logged-in speaker and the dialogue."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We propose a novel approach to build a parallel dialogue corpus out of monolingual scripts and their corresponding bilingual subtitles. We identify the dialogue boundaries according to the scene or shoot tags in the script to segment the monolingual dialogue, and then assign the appropriate monolingual dialogues to the source part of the bilingual subtitles to obtain the bilingual discourse dialogues. Finally, we align the bilingual dialogue subtitles lines to produce appropriate MT training material. We expand the current resources of dialogue generation from movie scripts to movie / episode scripts and specify the current parallel corpus construction to bilingual dialogue corpus based on bilingual subtitles. We pilot this approach on a 10-year sitcom Friends and automatically generate 5,428 bilingual parallel dialogues. This is a quick way to manually compare the bilingual dialog corpus to a bilingual subtitle."}, {"heading": "6.

Firstly, the parallel subtitle data and its corresponding monolingual movie script data are crawled and collected from Internet. Then tags such as speaker and discourse boundary from the script data are projected to its subtitle data via an information retrieval approach in order to map monolingual discourse to bilingual texts. We not only evaluate the mapping results, but also integrate speaker information into the translation. Experiments show our proposed method can achieve 81.79% and 98.64% accuracy on speaker and dialogue boundary annotation, and speaker-based language model adaptation can obtain around 0.5 BLEU points improvement in translation qualities. Finally, we publicly release around 100K parallel discourse data with manual speaker and dialogue boundary annotation.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
