In a traditional face-to-face conversation, paralanguage, or the ancillary meaning- and emotion-laden aspects of speech that are not actual verbal prose, gives contextual information that allows interactors to more appropriately understand the message being conveyed. In this paper, we conceptualize textual paralanguage (TPL), which we define as written manifestations of nonverbal audible, tactile, and visual elements that supplement or replace written language and that can be expressed through words, symbols, images, punctuation, demarcations, or any combination of these elements. We develop a typology of textual paralanguage using data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. We present a conceptual framework of antecedents and consequences of brands' use of textual paralanguage. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 May 2016 14:22:03 GMT  (1276kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06799v1", "Forthcoming in the Journal of Consumer Psychology"]], "COMMENTS": "Forthcoming in the Journal of Consumer Psychology", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["andrea webb luangrath", "joann peck", "victor a barger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.06799"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.06799.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Textual Paralanguage and Its Implications for Marketing Communications", "authors": ["Andrea Webb Luangrath", "Joann Peck", "Victor A.

Trager (1958) described the parallelism of vocal qualities and vocalizations that qualify literal words. These vocal qualities are called the \"implicit\" three aspects of language (Mehrabian, 1970), since human language is inherently permeated by vocal tones. Communicating aspects of language alongside literal words has been common among playwrights for centuries. In cinema and theater, paralinguistic elements are inserted into scriptions to give directions, convey emotions, and facilitate interaction, guiding theatrical performance across languages, cultures, and time (Poyatos, 2008)."}, {"heading": "Visual Nonverbal Communication", "text": "Just as auditory aspects of the language of face-to-face communication are inherent, so are visual elements of communication. Birdwhistell (1970) examined kinesics, the conscious or unconscious body movements that possess communicative value, including human gestures and body language. An important physical communicator is the human face; some scholars claim that it is the primary source of communicative information alongside human language (Knapp et al., 2013). Subtle changes in facial muscle movements can communicate emotional states and provide nonverbal feedback (Ekman et al., 1987). Unsurprisingly, visual textual parallel linguistic elements exist in the form of facial emojisms. Nonverbal visual elements are not exclusively associated with physical movements. Visual style conveys information in direct communication through embellishment, clothing, style, tattoos, and cosmetics (Barnard et al, 2001)."}, {"heading": "Haptic Nonverbal Communication", "text": "In fact, it is.

In a traditional face-to-face conversation, paralanguage, or the ancillary meaningand emotion-laden aspects of speech that are not actual verbal prose, gives contextual information that allows interactors to more appropriately understand the message being conveyed. In this paper, we conceptualize textual paralanguage (TPL), which we define as written manifestations of nonverbal audible, tactile, and visual elements that supplement or replace written language and that can be expressed through words, symbols, images, punctuation, demarcations, or any combination of these elements. We develop a typology of textual paralanguage using data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. We present a conceptual framework of antecedents and consequences of brands\u2019 use of textual paralanguage. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. A customer of Whole Foods tweets that he received a bad cupcake from the grocer, to which Whole Foods replies, \u201cA bad cupcake?!!?! Oh No!!! I\u2019m so sorry. *sigh* Thank you for letting us know\u201d (Whole Foods Market, 2013). How does communication on social media affect brand perceptions? Marketers are communicating with customers using a \u201cshorthand, digital language\u201d (Smith, 2015), yet the nature of these communications is under-investigated. In marketing, research on linguistics has focused primarily on the effects of word choice, such as the effect of explanatory words on consumption experiences (Moore, 2012), refusal words on choice (Patrick & Hagtvedt, 2012), and vowel sounds in brand names on brand preferences (Lowrey & Shrum, 2007). We also see evidence that imperative messages (e.g., \u201cBuy Now!\u201d) are more effective in uncommitted consumer-brand relationships (Moore, ZemackRugar, & Fitzsimons, working paper), and assertive statements are more effective at garnering consumer compliance for hedonic products (Kronrod, Grinstein, & Wathieu, 2012). In contrast, our work focuses not on the words said, but on the way nonverbal information is conveyed in writing. As computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become more prevalent, people have evolved new ways of communicating. Electronic messages are often imbued with nonverbal cues that signal individual characteristics, attitudes, and emotions. Indeed, various researchers recognize that people adapt to the limitations of CMC by creating surrogates for missing social cues (Byron & Baldridge, 2007; Ganster, Eimler, & Kr\u00e4mer, 2012; Walther, 1996). The primary goal of this paper is to provide a framework for the surrogates that people are using in digital communications. We define textual paralanguage (TPL) as written manifestations of nonverbal audible, tactile, and visual elements that supplement or replace written language and that can be", "creator": "Word"}}}
