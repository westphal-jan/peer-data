What kind of progress are they making? Should I intervene? Is my communication and the didactic design adapted to my students? Our hypothesis is that the analysis of natural language interactions between students, and between students and teachers, provide very valuable information and could be used to produce qualitative indicators to help teachers' decisions. We develop an automatic approach in three steps (1) to explore the discursive functions of messages in a CSCL platform, (2) to classify the messages automatically and (3) to evaluate correlations between discursive attitudes and other variables linked to the learning activity. Results tend to show that some types of discourse are correlated with a notion of Progress on the learning activities and the importance of emotive participation from the Teacher.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 May 2016 02:39:26 GMT  (2197kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07268v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.CL", "authors": ["eliana scheihing", "matthieu vernier", "javiera born", "julio guerra", "luis carcamo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07268"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.07268.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Classifying discourse in a CSCL platform to evaluate correlations with Teacher Participation and Progress", "authors": ["Eliana Scheihing", "Matthieu Vernier", "Javiera Born", "Julio Guerra", "Luis C\u00e1rcamo"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index Terms - Tools of Collaborative Learning, Consequences for Learning, Discourse, Machine Learning.F"}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1.1 ICT challenges in Education", "text": "The emergence of massive open online courses (Coursera, edX, OpenClassrooms), e-learning platforms (Moodle, KhanAcademy) and computer-based collaborative learning platforms (CSCL) (Metafora, Claroline) opens a new horizon in terms of knowledge formation and dissemination. At the same time, Blended Learning [1] is a growing educational program in formal education that combines traditional teaching and distance learning via web platforms such as the Kelluwen Project [33]. Several considerations accompany this paradigm shift in education. We group these research lines under four challenges: 1) How to optimize the motivation and satisfaction of learners? (also called engagement) 2) How to optimize the skills acquisition and performance of learners? (also called progress) 3) How to predict learning behavior (engagement / discouragement, progress / mental block, learning style, etc.) How to optimize the role of the teacher?"}, {"heading": "1.2 The Natural Language: A source of data to explore the cognitive phenomena related to Learning", "text": "In the context of the CSCL, particular attention is paid to the development of interactions between learners. However, collaboration theory assumes that knowledge is not just a matter of memorising a list of facts, but is dynamically constructed through social relationships, joint activities and dialogues. [16] For this reason, social media (forums, chatrooms, microblogs, video conferences) play a particularly central role in the CSCL platforms [17] and socio-communicative skills play a key role in knowledge building. By analysing dialogues between learners on the CSCL platforms, previous studies have shown that various linguistic and cognitive phenomena influence or correlate the progress and engagement of learners: 1) mutual listening and dialogical cohesion [18] [19], 2) expression of positive / negative emotions [21], 3) expression of uncertainty and questioning [22] [23], 4) quality of reasoning and vocabulary used [25]."}, {"heading": "1.3 Overview of the research problem addressed in this article", "text": "In this article, we automate the analysis of the discourse of students and teachers in a CSCL platform and then examine how discursive phenomena correlate with other variables, such as the quantitative involvement of teachers, the degree of progress of learning activities or the didactic design applied. We believe that our work can be used to better assist teachers in monitoring the development of learning activities and to assist curriculum planners in developing better learning activities.Our methodology is divided into three steps. First, we use machine learning techniques to explore latent topics and discover discursive categories present in teachers \"messages. Second, we automatically classify the messages according to their main discursive categories. Finally, we examine correlations between different variables related to learning activities and discursive behaviors observed in the previous step.

In other words, in order to properly understand a sentence, a first step is to find out what its main function is in the communication situation and to answer the question: \"What is the purpose of this message?\" The well-known model of language functions introduced by Roman Jakobson [39] (Figure 2) defines six main communication functions according to which an effective act of verbal communication can be described: 1) the emotional function: the intention of the message focuses on the emotions and attitudes of the speaker towards what he is talking about. Example: \"I have difficulty understanding the exercise\" 2) the conative function: it focuses on the interlocutor who tries to influence his behavior through an order or by persuasion. Example: \"Moving in groups of two or three metaphors.\""}, {"heading": "3 THE KELLUWEN PROJECT AND THE DATASET", "text": "The Kelluwen project is an attempt to integrate the effective use of blended learning into the formal curriculum of public education in southern Chile.

A DD covers a unit of content as defined in the curriculum of Chile's public schools, and contains a series of activities that combine traditional classroom learning strategies with the use of social web tools such as WordPress, Youtube, etc. In this way, Kelluwen aims to translate the sharing and communication skills of the Social Web into formal learning activities in schools.A typical DD contains a sequence of 8 to 12 classroom activities lasting between 1 and 1 / 2 hours (typical lecture time).In DD, students work in teams with the aim of creating a result that is eventually published in a social web tool, enabling further peer review processes.To achieve this, activities are organized in three phases: 1) a motivational phase in which students are presented concepts and themes, they must start and integrate knowledge."}, {"heading": "3.2 The dataset", "text": "The average length of a message is 7.3 words and 44.8 characters, which makes it quite short even for a microblog post.

The problem of activdades (activities) is, for example, actividad (activity). For this module, we used the Spanish lemmatization model available in the TreeTagger tool [41], 3) Stopword filtering: a short list of grammatical words (such as aquel (das), cada (each)) are filtered to simplify the vectorial representation of messages; 4) Basic spell correction: In the same idea, several slight spelling errors are corrected by using regular expressions. In particular, it concerns some words that contain multiple vowels that perform such asuooooooooooooooooo (goooooood)."}, {"heading": "4 EXPLORING TOPICS IN MESSAGES", "text": "The first step of our methodology is mainly exploratory.

The results of the maximum log probability for the 3-topic experiment are presented in Table 1, where the 20 most likely words are shown within each them.A check of the probabilities within each theme shows that the top 20 words cover 34% (for topics 2 and 3) and 39% (for topic 1) of the theme, respectively. In the first study, we found that theme 3 contains a set of words related to the content of didactic designs (world, literature, water, etc.).When repeating the process for topics 4, 5 and 6 clusters, theme 1 and theme 2 are the same, and the other topics relating to the different designs (world, literature, water, etc.), we consider the 3 to be sufficient clusters, etc."}, {"heading": "4.2 Discussion on the exploratory results", "text": "In Table 1, we note that the topic 1 includes opinion words (good, interesting, entertaining) and words referring to collaborative learning activity (work, classmates, activity). Therefore, we believe that topic 1 refers to the messages when a learner or teacher expresses a subjective attitude about the learning experience or about the work of others. In Jakobson theory, this type of messages typically refers to the emotional function of language (image). Topic 22: The datasets and preprocessing modules are available at the following address: https: / / github.com / matthieuvernier /.3. These types of messages typically refer to the emotional function of language (image / 4. parameters used: burn-in = 100 000 and iterations = 500.000.5 Topic 1 (Emotives) Topic 2 (Phatic) Topic 3 (Referential) trabajo (Work) XD (Work)."}, {"heading": "5 CLASSIFYING MESSAGES", "text": "In the first step, we examined the messages of learners and teachers and identified that they could be divided into three discursive categories: Emotional, Phatic and Referential. The second step is to evaluate the feasibility of automating the classification of messages. Based on a reference corpus, we developed and evaluated two statistical models based on LDA and SVM to classify messages from the Kelluwen platform."}, {"heading": "5.1 Reference corpus & Manual annotation", "text": "To form a reference corpus, 500 messages were randomly selected from the original data set. Subsequently, 3 human judges determined the most important discursive function of each of the three functions identified in the previous step (emotive, phatic or referential). We used the Fleiss kappa [42] to measure the reliability of the agreement between the judges. For this task, the Fleiss kappa is 0.70, which is a good match according to the scale proposed by Landis et al. [43]. In other words, even if this task can be complex for humans in some cases (when messages have a really bad syntax or, for example, contain only one emoticon), most people are able to understand the intention with which a message was sent. Finally, the category for each message in the reference corpus is that which was selected by at least two judges. There are no cases in which all judges disagreed with the other two."}, {"heading": "5.2 Classification methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 SVM", "text": "The first method is based on an SVM-monitored learning approach. For each message, we apply the preprocessing described in Section 3.3 to form a vector representation. In addition to the class of the message, the vector attributes are the general form of words that exist in the entire corpus (excluding the stopwords), which in this case are 1,543 words. The attribute value is binary and indicates whether the word occurs in the message or not. For example, the vector representation of the example (1) contains three attributes with the value \"1\": no, entender (understand) and \": - (.\" Other attributes (the other 1,540 words) have the value \"0.\" (1) No Entendo: - (I do not understand: - ((emotional) For our experiment, we used the Sequential Minimum Optimization Algorithm (SMO) available in the Weka library."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 LDA", "text": "The second method of automatic classification of messages is based on the LDA approach presented in Section 4. In LDA, each word has a probability of belonging to a specific topic. Therefore, this classifier simply calculates the probability that a message belongs to class Ci as the product of the probability that each word of the message belongs to class Ci. The class with the best probability is the class held by this classifier. Since LDA is not directly suitable for a supervised classification, this classifier is mainly used as a starting point to evaluate the SVM classification. 6 LDA SVM class P R F1 P R F1Phatic 84.9% 59.0% 69.6% 87.6% 97.9% 92.5% 94.6% 73.0% 73.8% 73.8% 73.8% 73.8% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Reference class 47.2% 76.4% 58.4% 94.7% 72.6% 72.8% 72.8% Total 67.8% 67.1% of classification messages with class 92.8% SVM."}, {"heading": "5.3 Classification results & Discussion", "text": "To determine the effectiveness of both classifiers, we use 3 classic metrics in the text classification: (1) precision (P) measures the system's ability to avoid irrelevant solutions, the Recall (R) measures the system's ability to provide all relevant solutions, and the F1 score (F1) is the harmonious mean between precision and recall.

Each arrow is one of the variables considered, with the numbers of the didactic design ID positioned in the figure corresponding to each experience. Thus, for example, didactic design 21 (language activity via YouTube) is often associated with progress, emotional messages from teachers, and reference messages from students.

Additionally, this figure confirms a fairly strong negative correlation between progress and the average number of days between activities (variable mean)."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this article, we show that the analysis of natural interactions between students and teachers provides valuable information that could help teachers in their decisions regarding computer-aided learning. We demonstrated the ability to automate the analysis of these interactions, even when texts are short and loud. By using a combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques, we found that the messages of learners and teachers can be automatically classified according to three communication intentions described by Jakobson: creating or maintaining a communication channel (Phatic), exchanging information about the learning context (Referential) and expressing an emotion or a subjective attitude (Emotive). Results of a correlation calculation show that the types of discourse used by learners tend to have a relationship with the teacher qualitative participation and progress of learning activity."}], "references": [{"title": "The Past, Present and Future of Blended Learning: An in Depth Analysis of Literature", "author": ["B.

for teachers, especially when learners are working collaboratively: Are my students motivated? What kind of progress are they making? Should I intervene? Is my communication and the didactic design adapted to my students? Our hypothesis is that the analysis of natural language interactions between students, and between students and teachers, provide very valuable information and could be used to produce qualitative indicators to help teachers\u2019 decisions. We develop an automatic approach in three steps (1) to explore the discursive functions of messages in a CSCL platform, (2) to classify the messages automatically and (3) to evaluate correlations between discursive attitudes and other variables linked to the learning activity. Results tend to show that some types of discourse are correlated with a notion of Progress on the learning activities and the importance of emotive participation from the Teacher.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
