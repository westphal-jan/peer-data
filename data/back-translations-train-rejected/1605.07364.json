This work investigates the effects of non-Gaussian stochastic engines on the performance of metaheuristics when solving a real-world optimization problem. In this work, the bacteria foraging algorithm (BFA) was employed in tandem with four random generators (stochastic engines). The stochastic engines operate using the Weibull distribution, Gamma distribution, Gaussian distribution and a chaotic mechanism. The two non-Gaussian distributions are the Weibull and Gamma distributions. In this work, the approaches developed were implemented on the real-world multi-objective resin bonded sand mould problem. The Pareto frontiers obtained were benchmarked using two metrics; the hyper volume indicator (HVI) and the proposed Average Explorative Rate (AER) metric.

It can be observed in Table 5 and Figure 6 that the W-BFA, which is equipped with a non-Gaussian stochastic motor, outperforms all other approaches used in this work in terms of individual solution and degree of Pareto boundary dominance. However, it is possible that the choice of the non-Gaussian distribution used in the solution method depends on the type of solution landscape, although it is also equipped with a non-Gaussian stochastic motor. Due to this dependence, the effectiveness of the computational approach with a certain type of non-Gaussian stochastic motor may prove advantageous, but it is possible that the choice of the non-Gaussian distribution used in the solution method depends on the type of solution landscape."}], "references": [{"title": "Biomimicry of social foraging bacteria for distributed optimization: Models, principles, and emergent behaviors", "author": ["Y Liu", "KM Passino", "MA Simaan"], "venue": "Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Particle Swarm Optimization", "author": ["J Kennedy", "R Eberhart"], "venue": "IEEE Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Networks: Perth, Australia", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Cuckoo search algorithm for the selection of optimal machining parameters in milling", "author": ["AR Yildiz"], "venue": "operations.

structure of metaheuristic algorithms. This work investigates the effects of non-Gaussian stochastic engines on the performance of metaheuristics when solving a real-world optimization problem. In this work, the bacteria foraging algorithm (BFA) was employed in tandem with four random generators (stochastic engines). The stochastic engines operate using the Weibull distribution, Gamma distribution, Gaussian distribution and a chaotic mechanism. The two non-Gaussian distributions are the Weibull and Gamma distributions. In this work, the approaches developed were implemented on the real-world multi-objective resin bonded sand mould problem. The Pareto frontiers obtained were benchmarked using two metrics; the hyper volume indicator (HVI) and the proposed Average Explorative Rate (AER) metric. Detail discussions from various perspectives on the effects of non-Gaussian random generators in metaheuristics are provided. *Corresponding author: Ganesan T, School of Chemical Engineering, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, 5005 South Australia, Australia; E-mail: tim.ganesan@gmail.com Received September 29, 2015; Accepted November 27, 2015; Published November 30, 2015 Citation: Ganesan T, Vasant P, Elamvazuthi I (2015) Non-Gaussian Random Generators in Bacteria Foraging Algorithm for Multiobjective Optimization.
