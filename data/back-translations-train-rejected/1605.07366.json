We present our experiments in building an unsupervised corpus-driven template based tactical NLG system. We consider templates as a sequence of words containing gaps. Our idea is based on the observation that templates are grammatical locally (within their textual span). We posit the construction of a sentence as a highly restricted sequence of such templates. This work is an attempt to explore the resulting search space using Genetic Algorithms to arrive at acceptable solutions. We present a baseline implementation of this approach which outputs gapped text.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 May 2016 10:28:43 GMT  (228kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07366v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nikhilesh bhatnagar", "radhika mamidi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07366"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.07366.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}], "references": [{"title": "A Statistical NLG Framework for Aggregated Planning and Realization", "author": ["R.
