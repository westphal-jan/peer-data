CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The main advantage of the proposed model is its universality. This is due to the fact that the dialogue manager and the speech model are not dependent on the task to be performed. They are separate modules that can be updated independently of the system.In this report the following tasks were defined: The process of speech recognition was examined and presented, the specifics of the problem related to the speech recognition of children were analysed, an architectural model of a system for speech recognition of children was presented. Future work: A prototype of an information system based on the presented model to investigate the problems related to speech recognition of children up to 7 years of age. A linguistic adaptation of existing models is carried out in order to meet the limited vocabulary of children. \u2022 An adaptation of acoustic models and techniques is carried out to meet the specifics of language in children."}, {"heading": "4.
