INTRODUCTION", "text": "The design and realization of the language database is an integral part of speech recognition systems. Its quality and scope strongly influence the activities of recognized devices [12]. Therefore, each acoustic-phonetic database must contain in itself all the phonetic richness of language studies. In our case, the target group is children aged 4 to 6 years (kindergarten and preschool group) whose mother tongue is Bulgarian. Often, they cannot yet read and write, and some of them know the numbers. In practice, collecting the spoken language of such speakers has proved to be a difficult task and additional resources had to be used. For example, the spoken word is read, and then the child repeats it [4]. Frequently, the selected words appear too complicated and the children have difficulty in reproducing them. In addition, young children easily lose concentration and distract themselves, which further impedes the collection of data. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to collect a database that allows the recording of additional helpful information related to the support of the speech recognition process."}, {"heading": "2. ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM", "text": "According to [2] spoken language databases, two main objectives have to be solved - the first is to conduct basic research on the acoustic, phonetic, lexical, semantic, syntactic expressions of a language, and the second is to determine differences between speakers, such as gender, age, environment, etc. In the development of systems related to processing and speech recognition, what is essential is the organization, flexibility and size of the database. Also, the extent of actual coverage of the structure (syntax, word order, grammar, etc.) used in the language and its phonetic properties is important [9]. The first factor related to the design of the database determines the reaction time during speech recognition and the linguistic factor controls the specificity of the speakers.It is also known that the language of children contains a number of specific parameters [14], which transform them into a group of users with specific language requirements."}, {"heading": "3. PREPARATION FO DEVELOPING THE DATABASE OF SPOKEN SPEECH", "text": "There are three main aspects to consider when creating a spoken language database - the type of dictionary, the number of sessions performed with a speaker, and the technical aspects of the recording [Lamel et al., 1986]."}, {"heading": "3.1. Dictionary", "text": "In order to achieve satisfactory results in the recognition process with a recognition system, according to [7] the training must be carried out by the same target group whose language is recognized. Recordings must therefore be oriented towards infants (ages 4 to 6), which allows for fast and convenient recording, with an appropriate balance between gender and age. Typically, the dictionary covers the entire range of phonemes of the language. Here, we have difficulty with infants because they use a different vocabulary than adults. Therefore, we use suggestions from [1] Frequency dictionary. The speakers used must cover all sections of the existing language-specific characteristics at that age."}, {"heading": "3.2. The number of sessions", "text": "Session refers to all entries made by a speaker within a specified period of time (e.g. per 1 day). This defines the length of the recordings and the number of sessions for each child who participated in the study. Recordings must be as short as possible. Each recording contains one speaker's lecture."}, {"heading": "3.3. . Technical aspects", "text": "They contain a representation of the environment, technical equipment (sound card, microphone type, etc.) and algorithms to eliminate the noise. Speech must be collected in a realistic way.In our case, recordings are made at home, because from a psychological point of view it turns out that children at this age feel most relaxed and can communicate more easily with the leader of the experiment. Each recording will contain only one spoken word."}, {"heading": "4. MODEL OF CHILDREN\u2019S SPOKEN SPEECH DATABASE", "text": "Most speech recognition systems do not allow the use of interactive elements during the recording of the spoken language, such as moving objects, image changes, hearing different sounds. This system is an attempt to remedy this deficiency. A relationship chart of the proposed database is in Fig. 1. The three main points on which emphasis is placed are: the corpus (table \"words\"), the speaker (table \"speaker\") and performed recordings (table \"recordings\"). Let us now focus our attention on the information stored for each speaker, children whose language is collected. They consist of: full name, gender, age (years and months), date of birth, current address, number of children in the family, number of children in the order of birth, attendance at a kindergarten and if so, which kindergarten, whether attendance of additional courses (speech therapist, singing lessons, music lessons), deviations from normal development and diseases. The information collected about the recordings of the child, the location of the speech noise or the accompanying children, the emotional state of the recordings, the accompanying sound, etc."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENT", "text": "The experimental part consists of the development of a prototype model of the proposed language database (Fig. 2). There is a main form, which is available through the menu bar, the other modules. The software makes it easy to add new words to the database, there is an automatic phonetic transcription, which is consistent with the International Phonetic Alphabet and the use of illustrations and sound files. There is also the possibility to work with electronic papers of the speakers (about 10-15 of them), since we have to organize the \"word collection\" for different sessions. They are organized thematically (\"Seasons,\" \"Numbers,\" etc.) and a small group of words (about 10-15 of them), since the young child cannot spend long time (more than 30 minutes per day) in front of the computer. Once the collections are ready, one can continue recording."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This report fulfilled several tasks: firstly, the process of developing a database for the spoken language of children was introduced and examined; secondly, specific issues related to the recognition of children's language were analysed; and thirdly, but no less importantly, an architectural model of the language database was proposed. In the experimental part, a prototype system for the recognition of children in Bulgarian was presented; the important advantage of this model is the close focus and comprehensive multimedia representation of individual words in the corpus. In this way, the language of children can be recorded with minimal involvement of the tutor. This database is the beginning of the development of a prototype system for automatic speech recognition of children aged 4 to 6 years whose mother tongue is Bulgarian. In the future, the problem of quick access to the contents of large multimedia databases and the exploration of the acoustic diversity of existing databases is to be solved; the development of models for segmentation of phonemes from the words of the recorded language and the calculation of the excellent word rate is to be worked on."}, {"heading": "7.
