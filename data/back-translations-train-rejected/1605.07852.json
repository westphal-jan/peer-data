Stemming is a common strategy to this end. Among many approaches for stemming, statistical stemming has shown to be effective in a few number of languages, particularly those highly inflected ones. Common statistical approaches heavily relies on string similarity in terms of prefix and suffix matching. In this paper we propose a method that is able to find any popular affix in any position of a word; specifically finding infixes is a required task in Persian, Arabic, and Malay particularly in irregular formations and is a future challenge in informal texts. The proposed method aims at finding a number of transformation rules for expanding a word with its inflectional/derivation formations. Our experimental results on CLEF 2008 and CLEF 2009 English-Persian CLIR tasks indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms all the baselines in terms of MAP.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 12:25:26 GMT  (1026kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07852v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 21:37:19 GMT  (1019kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07852v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["javid dadashkarimi", "hossein nasr esfahani", "heshaam faili", "azadeh shakery"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07852"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.07852.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "SS4MCT: A Statistical Stemmer for Morphologically Complex Texts", "authors": ["Javid Dadashkarimi", "Hossein Nasr Esfahani", "Heshaam Faili"], "emails": ["dadashkarimi@ut.ac.ir", "h_nasr@ut.ac.ir", "shakery@ut.ac.ir", "hfaili@ut.ac.ir"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: stemming, infix recognition, comparison of inflection / derivative formation, dictionary-based, cross-language information acquisition."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to assert themselves, that they are able to trump themselves, and that they are able to trump themselves."}, {"heading": "2 SS4MCT: A Statistical Stemmer for Morphologically Complex Texts", "text": "In this section, we propose an unattended method for finding inflections in a language. To this end, we first introduce a transformation rule that represents an edit path that transforms the word w into w \u2032 based on a number of actions. Our goal is to estimate the probability of each transformation rule P (R) and to calculate the probability of generating inflections for a particular term (i.e. p (w \u2032 | w)). In sections 2.1 and 2.2, we present the proposed method in more detail, and in section 2.3, we propose a rating framework for the method."}, {"heading": "2.1 Transformation Rules", "text": "Each transformation rule contains a number of actions that turn a word into an inflection. If two terms are k points apart, the rule that transforms the input term into the output term contains k actions and the maximum probability of the POS tag of the input word. Each action consists of the following attributes: c, the differential sign, p, the position of that character (start, middle, and end), and o, the corresponding operation on the character in the MED algorithm (delete or insert). Intuitively, we define a few general positions for attachments to avoid the conciseness of the rules. A replacement operation can be replaced by a few insert / delete operations, so we ignore the replacement operation. Table 1 shows a series of examples of the rules."}, {"heading": "2.2 Probability of the Rules", "text": "To calculate the probability of generating a diffraction for a particular term (i.e. p (w \u2032 | w)), we can calculate the transformation rule (R) between w and w \u2032 and estimate p (w \u2032 | w) by p (R). To calculate the probability of each rule, we use a large collection of words from a document collection. For each word pair in the collection (w and w \u2032), we calculate the rule for transforming w into w \u2032 and count the number of times this rule has occurred in the collection. The higher the occurrence of a rule, the more likely it is that it is valid. Finally, we estimate the rule probability with maximum probability."}, {"heading": "2.3 How to Evaluate the Algorithm", "text": "In this section, we provide a framework for the originating algorithm to evaluate its effectiveness. We use dictionary-based cross-border information retrieval (CLIR) for this purpose. In heavily inflected languages, bilingual dictionaries contain only original forms of words. Therefore, query systems in dictionary-based CLIR are required to either stammer or leave documents and queries intact [8,4,12] or to extend the query by inflections. We have opted for the query enhancement approach, which is a widely used approach to compensate for the lack of diffraction options [9,3,5]. To this end, we used the following probabilistic framework [5]: p (ci, j | qi) = 1 p (ci, j \u00b2) = 1 p (ci, ci \u00b2, i \u00b2, j \u00b2) = 1 c (c \u00b2, j \u00b2) = 1 c (j \u00b2) = 1 (c \u00b2)."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "We used the Kullback-Leibler statistical language modeling framework of the Lemur toolkit for our on-demand task.
