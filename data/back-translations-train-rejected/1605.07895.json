Most of the early attempts at its solution used manually constructed linguistic and syntactic rules on small and domain-specific data sets. However, with the advent of big data, the availability of affordable computing power and the recent popularization of machine learning, the paradigm to tackle this problem has slowly shifted. Machines are now expected to learn generic causal extraction rules from labelled data with minimal supervision, in a domain independent-manner. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of causal relation extraction techniques from both paradigms, and analyse their relative strengths and weaknesses, with recommendations for future work.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 14:23:21 GMT  (421kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07895v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["nabiha asghar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07895"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.07895.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Automatic Extraction of Causal Relations from Natural Language Texts: A Comprehensive Survey", "authors": ["Nabiha Asghar", "David R.

NON-STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES", "text": "The idea of automatic information extraction from natural language texts began in the 1980s, in the wake of the increasingly affordable computing power and the growing popularity of machine learning. In 1989, Selfridge [25] wrote an interesting essay on why it would be very difficult to develop an automatic causal knowledge acquisition system based on natural language. He stressed that a good causal analyzer must necessarily emerge from a knowledge representation model that contains a semantic framework, while at the same time having domain knowledge, in order to accurately identify meaningful causal connections from each text. Furthermore, it was claimed that the tool should be able to deduce any unspecified direct components between the causal component and the causal component in order to generate a more precise and comprehensive causal chain, and should be able to disprove causally ambiguous statements."}, {"heading": "A.

STATISTICAL & MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES", "text": "The need to use a large amount of labeled, domain and type-independent text data and automatically extract implicit patterns in the text meant that machine learning techniques could potentially do much better than purely linguistic techniques.

In addition, we offer an in-depth discussion of at least five highly cited research studies from both paradigms. We observe that the extraction of causal relationships is one of the most difficult NLP issues, primarily due to the presence of implicit linguistic constructs that may or may not be causal depending on the textual context. Data sparseness is another problem for highly specialized areas where expert annotation is required, making it difficult to use minimally monitored techniques for this problem. By using advanced feature construction techniques, lexico-semantic resources such as WordNet, and powerful learning algorithms such as SVMs, the machine learning community is able to achieve reasonably good results in recent years."}], "references": [{"title": "Automatic detection of causal relations for question answering", "author": ["R.

Most of the early attempts at its solution used manually constructed linguistic and syntactic rules on small and domain-specific data sets. However, with the advent of big data, the availability of affordable computing power and the recent popularization of machine learning, the paradigm to tackle this problem has slowly shifted. Machines are now expected to learn generic causal extraction rules from labelled data with minimal supervision, in a domain independent-manner. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of causal relation extraction techniques from both paradigms, and analyse their relative strengths and weaknesses, with recommendations for future work.
