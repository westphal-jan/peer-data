A state is given by the special assignment of values to these variables: S = {f = v | v \u00b2 D (f), f \u00b2 F. The value of the variable f in state S is called S (f). Action Model A consists of operators a = < Ca, Ea >, where Ca is the cost of the action, and Ea = {< f, vo, vn > | f \u00b2 F; vo, vn > Ea \u00b2 D (f)} is the set of effects.

Furthermore, D is a vector of size m, whose ith element di is the change in a target f-shaped state from the current state to the final state, i.e. di = vg \u2212 vc; vg = fi-G, vc = fi-S; and let x be a vector of size n, whose ith element is xi-N. Then the following equality applies: Mx = D (1) The integer solution x to this system of linear equations with the least | x-shaped | gives the operator a lower limit required to solve the planning problem, i.e. the x-shaped solution is multiplicable."}, {"heading": "Sparse coding.", "text": "Since the operator is an integer, ideally we want an integer solution for Eqn 4 (which makes the problem mathematically insoluble = = 2P = 2P = 2P). Unfortunately, the polynomially bound Lagrangian method described above is not geared to this aspect, which would lead to poor heuristic values for certain problem areas. To describe this problem geometrically, we consider a plot domain with two yielding operators (of unit cost), so that x = < x1, x2 >. If the plane inscribed by Mx = D into the two-dimensional space is close to two of the axis, the l2 norm above the results is calculated in small fractions, and therefore a less informed heuristic method.

Each entry in the table represents the percentage difference of the original heuristic value and the optimal plan length of an average of 61% of all problems in each domain. The% Compliance column shows the average number of target weight variables in the problems. Lines 1-3 show the performance of our heuristic values in the original domains (\"-\" indicates that the heuristics could not be calculated due to the absence of target weight variables). Lines 3-6 show the performance in domains where% compliance has been increased (this was identified by identifying instances in the action model where variables assume a don't care condition, i.e. a value of -1, and replace it with appropriate values conditioned by domain axioms)."}, {"heading": "Discussion and Related Work", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Relation to Existing Heuristics.", "text": "The proposed heuristics have strong associations with both the heuristics of state change equations and the number of operators [8, 3, 10]. Especially compliant conditions capture the net change criteria very succinctly and are therefore extremely useful where such properties are relevant. Another interesting link to existing work is in relation to graph-based heuristics [2], except here we relax preconditions instead of deleting effects."}, {"heading": "Compliance.", "text": "Our approach works better in areas with many target-conforming conditions, e.g. in manufacturing areas [6] or in puzzles such as Sudoku [1]. Therefore, goal completion strategies and semantic conservation measures have a direct influence on the quality of heuristics. Interim representations such as Transition Normal Form (TNF) [7] should be investigated in this context."}, {"heading": "Landmarks.", "text": "We have discussed the simplest version of this formulation here, but it can be easily expanded to include more informative features such as boundary markers [9]; a boundary condition is added simply by subtracting the corresponding net change from D: di: di: ka \u00b7 (xn \u2212 xo) if < di, xo, xn > Ea and a: A is a measure characteristic with cardinality ka; and the closed solution remains valid. Indeed, observations regarding plan recognition with operator number markers and the same approach are valid, demonstrating the flexibility of our approach."}, {"heading": "Resource Constrained Interaction.", "text": "The approach is particularly relevant in the context of multi-agent interactions constrained by the use of \u03c0\u03b1 (\u03b7) of a common resource by an agent \u03b1 plan. For example, if an agent \u03b12 wanted to prevent the execution of his plan, he only had to ensure that \u03b7 s.t. \u03c0\u03b11 (\u03b7) + \u03c0\u03b12 (\u03b7) > | \u03b7 |. Similarly, in a collaborative environment, if agent \u03b12 wanted to ensure the success of the plan \u03b11, it would be necessary to ensure that agent \u03b51 (\u03b7) + \u03c0\u03b12 (\u03b7) \u2264 | \u03b7 |.In fact, since resource variables are compliant, our approach can provide quick estimates of an agent's intention without calculating the entire plan.This research is supported in part by ONR grants N00014-13-1-0176, N00014-131-0519 and N00014-15-201, NARO 1113-1113-WARF."}], "references": [{"title": "Linear systems, sparse solutions, and sudoku", "author": ["Prabhu Babu", "Kristiaan Pelckmans", "Petre Stoica", "Jian Li"], "venue": "Signal Processing Letters, IEEE,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Fast planning through planning graph analysis", "author": ["Avrim L Blum", "Merrick L Furst"], "venue": "Artificial intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1997}, {"title": "Flow-based heuristics for optimal planning: Landmarks and merges", "author": ["Blai Bonet", "Menkes Van Den Briel"], "venue": "In ICAPS,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Enhancing sparsity by reweighted l1 minimization", "author": ["Emmanuel J Cand\u00e8s", "Michael B Wakin", "Stephen P Boyd"], "venue": "Journal of Fourier analysis and applications,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2008}, {"title": "A note on the complexity of l p minimization", "author": ["Dongdong Ge", "Xiaoye Jiang", "Yinyu Ye"], "venue": "Mathematical programming,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Ai planning versus manufacturingoperation planning: A case study", "author": ["Dana S Nau", "Satyandra K Gupta", "William C Regli"], "venue": "In IJCAI,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 1995}, {"title": "A normal form for classical planning tasks", "author": ["Florian Pommerening", "Malte Helmert"], "venue": "In ICAPS,", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Lp-based heuristics for cost-optimal planning", "author": ["Florian Pommerening", "Gabriele R\u00f6ger", "Malte Helmert", "Blai Bonet"], "venue": "In ICAPS,", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2014}, {"title": "On the extraction, ordering, and usage of landmarks in planning", "author": ["Julie Porteous", "Laura Sebastia", "J\u00f6rg Hoffmann"], "venue": "In ECP,", "citeRegEx": "9", "shortCiteRegEx": "9", "year": 2001}, {"title": "An lpbased heuristic for optimal planning", "author": ["Menkes Van Den Briel", "J Benton", "Subbarao Kambhampati", "Thomas Vossen"], "venue": "In CP,", "citeRegEx": "10", "shortCiteRegEx": "10", "year": 2007}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 4, "context": "Secondly, minimizing the l0 norm is NP-hard [5].", "startOffset": 44, "endOffset": 47}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "To this end, we suggest minimization of l1-norm (l1-LP) or weighted l1-norm (\u03c9-l1-LP) [4] to enforce positive integer solutions.", "startOffset": 86, "endOffset": 89}, {"referenceID": 7, "context": "The proposed heuristic has close associations with both heuristics on state change equations and operator counts [8, 3, 10].", "startOffset": 113, "endOffset": 123}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "The proposed heuristic has close associations with both heuristics on state change equations and operator counts [8, 3, 10].", "startOffset": 113, "endOffset": 123}, {"referenceID": 9, "context": "The proposed heuristic has close associations with both heuristics on state change equations and operator counts [8, 3, 10].", "startOffset": 113, "endOffset": 123}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": "Another interesting connection to existing work is with respect to graph-plan based heuristics [2], except here we are relaxing preconditions instead of delete effects.", "startOffset": 95, "endOffset": 98}, {"referenceID": 5, "context": "in manufacturing domains [6] or in puzzles like Sudoku [1].", "startOffset": 25, "endOffset": 28}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "in manufacturing domains [6] or in puzzles like Sudoku [1].", "startOffset": 55, "endOffset": 58}, {"referenceID": 6, "context": "Intermediate representations such as transition normal form (TNF) [7] should be investigated in this context.", "startOffset": 66, "endOffset": 69}, {"referenceID": 8, "context": "We discussed the simplest version of this formulation here, but it can be easily extended to incorporate more informative features like landmarks [9].", "startOffset": 146, "endOffset": 149}], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "In this paper, we develop a computationally simpler version of the operator count heuristic for a particular class of domains.
