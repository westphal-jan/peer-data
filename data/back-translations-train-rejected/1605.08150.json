Fuster describes five cognitive functions: perception, memory, attention, language, and intelligence. We describe the Perception-Action Cyclec as it applies to cognitive radar, and then discuss long-term memory, memory storage, memory retrieval and working memory. A comparison between memory in human cognition and cognitive radar is given as well. Attention is another function described by Fuster, and we have given the comparison of attention in human cognition and cognitive radar. We talk about the four functional blocks from the PAC: Bayesian filter, feedback information, dynamic programming and state-space model for the radar environment. Then, to show that the PAC improves the tracking accuracy of Cognitive Radar over Traditional Active Radar, we have provided simulation results. In the simulation, three nonlinear filters: Cubature Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter are compared. Based on the results, radars implemented with CKF perform better than the radars implemented with UKF or radars implemented with EKF. Further, radar with EKF has the worst accuracy and has the biggest computation load because of derivation and evaluation of Jacobian matrices. We suggest using the concept of risk management to better control parameters and improve performance in cognitive radar. We believe, spectrum sensing can be seen as a potential interest to be used in cognitive radar and we propose a new approach Probabilistic ICA which will presumably reduce noise based on estimation error in cognitive radar. Parallel computing is a concept based on divide and conquers mechanism, and we suggest using the parallel computing approach in cognitive radar by doing complicated calculations or tasks to reduce processing time.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 May 2016 05:49:25 GMT  (1240kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08150v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["krishanth krishnan", "taralyn schwering", "saman sarraf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.08150"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.08150.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Cognitive Dynamic Systems: A Technical Review of Cognitive Radar", "authors": ["Krishanth Krishnan", "Taralyn Schwering", "Saman Sarraf"], "emails": ["samansarraf@ieee.org"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "I.

Cognitive Functions", "text": "In his book, CORTEX AND MIND: UNIFYING COGNITION, Fuster describes five cognitive functions: perception, memory, attention, language and intelligence. Perception refers to the understanding of the world or the environment around it. It goes beyond simple sensory input and includes functions of memory and attention. In neurobiological terms, perception involves the activation of cognits or cortical networks that make up memories. Memory deals with the ability to retain information about oneself and the environment. This information includes both conscious and unconscious knowledge, the mental traces of experience, acquired facts and relationships between facts. [1] Memory formation (sometimes called memory encoding) involves the formation of cortical networks and the strengthening of synapses that form these networks to create associations in which memories can be retrieved."}, {"heading": "C. Cognitive Dynamic systems", "text": "The first papers on cognitive dynamic systems in 2005 and 2006 did not refer to Fuster, the perceptual action cycle or any of the principles of cognition. However, cognitive radar was specifically inspired by the echolocation of bats, and it is not difficult to see how the perceptual action cycle is applied directly to bats? Ability to navigate their environment and locate food based on the sounds they emit. Subsequent papers on cognitive dynamic systems have adopted ideas from Fuster's work. Due to the similarity of the structure between cognitive radar and human cognition, in particular the overall structure of the perceptive action cycle, cognitive radar is well positioned to benefit from Fuster's work on the functions of cognition."}, {"heading": "II.

Attention", "text": "As already mentioned, attention refers to the efficient activation of cognits for a given task. There is no specific structure responsible for the activation of attention in the human brain, but it is a process or mechanism distributed throughout the cognitive cycle, action cycle, and memory structures. In the human brain, attention is responsible for the activation of relevant cognits in the memory, while inhibiting other cognits. Similarly, attention is used on the cognitive radar to locate a search area when a set of abstract features is compared to a signal in the system modal library or in the transmission waveform library, using the so-called \"explorative exploit\" strategy [6]. Starting from the point chosen as the center point in the previous iteration of the perception-action cycle, the matching process seeks a small group of points rather than an extensive search throughout the library. This strategy reduces the computational resources used in this matching process, as well as the stabilization of the system [3]."}, {"heading": "D. Cognitive Radar", "text": "There are two functional parts of the perception of people who are able to recognize a problem that cannot be found, namely the perception-action cycles and distributed memory. Perceptions performed in the recipient world play two important roles: the recognition of the unknown goal and its imitation behavior in relation to time [2]. As discussed above, the perception cycle generates an information gain when it processes signals from the environment, in which the order of gain increases from the last cycle to the next. Perceptions of perceptions in cognitive radar systems can be formulated in such a way that the feedback information can be formulated using the state vector. [3] Four functional blockages form the basis of the perception cycle in cognitive radars: Bayesian filtering, dynamic programming, and state models for the radar environment. These functional blocks are maintained in the following way: 1) People are identified with the Bayesian filter systems."}, {"heading": "III.

Risk Management and Cognitive Radar", "text": "Considering cognitive radar as a complicated system, there are many parameters and factors that need to be controlled in order to improve system performance and minimize any risks that might appear to be errors. In such a case, the concept of risk management from an economic point of view can be helpful in extracting risk factors from our system and solving arithmetic problems such as noise reduction. Risk management is an organized method for identifying and measuring risks and for selecting, developing and implementing options for managing risks [12]. 13 Explains the risk hierarchy in a given system. Risk planning is the continuous development of an organized, comprehensive approach to torisk management. The initial planning includes: defining a strategy; defining objectives and goals; planning, managing and monitoring activities; identifying resources, tasks and responsibilities; organizing and training IPT members in risk management; establishing a method for tracking risks and documenting them continuously; and establishing a method for determining and distributing risks."}, {"heading": "B. Spectrum sensing in cognitive radar", "text": "As discussed before, environmental perception is the first function of cognition. Technically, we must perceive the environment and extract the distinctive components from the environment. As with cognitive radio, there is a potential interest in using spectral scanning in cognitive radar. Therefore, we can consider spectral estimation as the discriminant for scanning the environment. Spectral scanning methods can be categorized into four methods: 1) Power spectrum using the equation: E [| x-T (\u03c9) | 2] = E [1T, 0 T x-T (t) ei\u03c9tdt, 0 T x (t) e \u2212 i\u03c9tdt, dt, dt, dt, dt, dt, dt, dt, dt, dt, dt, dt, dt, dt, (t) (2) (2) Space-time processing, 3) Time frequency analysis, 4) Spectral line components that have developed different algorithms in each approach, with their advantages and disadvantages."}, {"heading": "C.

In practice, parallel computing and processing are of potential interest in solving the above problems computationally. Although parallel computing seems to make the system more complex and expensive, the currently available Universal Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) can be used.

We describe the Perception-Action Cyclec (PAC) as it applies to cognitive radar, and then discuss long-term memory, memory storage, memory retrieval and working memory. A comparison between memory in human cognition and cognitive radar is given as well. Attention is another function described by Fuster, and we have given the comparison of attention in human cognition and cognitive radar. We talk about the four functional blocks from the PAC: Bayesian filter, feedback information, dynamic programming and state-space model for the radar environment. Then, to show that the PAC improves the tracking accuracy of Cognitive Radar over Traditional Active Radar, we have provided simulation results. In the simulation, three nonlinear filters: Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) are compared. Based on the results, radars implemented with CKF perform better than the radars implemented with UKF or radars implemented with EKF. Further, radar with EKF has the worst accuracy and has the biggest computation load because of derivation and evaluation of Jacobian matrices. In addition, we suggest using the concept of risk management to better control parameters and improve performance in cognitive radar, especially in noise reduction. We believe, spectrum sensing can be seen as a potential interest to be used in cognitive radar and we propose a new approach Probabilistic Independent Component Analysis (PICA) which will presumably reduce noise based on estimation error in cognitive radar. Parallel computing is a concept based on divide and conquers mechanism, and in this report we suggest to use the parallel computing approach in cognitive radar by doing complicated calculations or tasks to reduce processing time, increase speed of system and higher precision. With the increased use of parallel computing in other fields of engineering, General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) would be the best way to implement parallel computing in cognitive radar.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
