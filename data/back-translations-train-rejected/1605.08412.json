HTRtS2 includes a task of word recognition for segmented historical documents, see [SRTV14] for all further details. This data consists of page images from the Bentham Collection, a well-known transScriptorium project dataset.Our neural networks were previously used in the context of the OpenHaRT 2013 international handwriting competition in the appendix to the ICDAR 2013 conference, see [LLG13]."}, {"heading": "2 Short Description", "text": "Note 1.

Although they are mainly based on our traditional recurring neural network-based recognition engine ARGUS, the 14 variations result from the combination of 2 training programs, trn-1 / trn-2, with 7 decoding programs, dec-BP / dec-CE / dec-DM and2http: / / transcriptorium.eu / ~ htrcontest 3http: / / www.citlab.uni-rostock.de 4http: / / www.planet.dedering of the respective labels, reflecting both the increasing complexity of the programs and the expected improved quality of the handwritten text recognition task."}, {"heading": "2.2 Basic Scheme", "text": "For the general approach, we can briefly refer to earlier CITlab system descriptions [LLS13, LGSL14, SGLL14], as the overall scheme has not changed substantially."}, {"heading": "2.3 Preprocessing", "text": "We worked on line polygon images, see 2.4.1 for further explanation of the data. First, certain standard pre-processing routines were used, i.e. \u2022 Image normalization: contrast, size; \u2022 Write normalization: line curvature, stroke inclination, script inclination. Then, images were further standardized by CITlab's proprietary write normalization, ensuring a fixed image height of 96 pixels, with the body of the font suitably stretched in and out to cover the essential central part of the line image. Finally, these were the input images for subsequent processing with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)."}, {"heading": "2.3.1 Recurrent Neural Network", "text": "The resulting line images have been fed into the first core component of the engine, which we call the Sequence Processing Recurrent Neural Network (SPRNN). Note that we have complete line images with no further segmentation. The output of the SPRNN then consists of a certain number of vectors. This number is related to the line length, because each vector contains information about a certain image position. Specifically, the entries are understood to estimate the probabilities of each alphabet character at the position under consideration. Also, note that for HTRtS-2015 we worked with the alphabet that contains \u2022 all digits, lowercase letters and uppercase letters of the standard Latin alphabet, which are then used for decoding. Also, note that for HTRtS-2015 we worked with the alphabet that contains \u2022 all digits, lowercase letters and uppercase letters of the standard Latin alphabet\\ _"}, {"heading": "2.4.1 Training Data", "text": "trn-1 consists of all 1stBatch line polygons, i.e. images of 10 491 line polygons from 433 page. trn-2 contains trn-1 and all 2ndBatch page images: an additional 313 pages for which the line polygons were not available. trn-2 uses proprietary CITlab tools to extract a total of 3,968 additional line polygons, s.t. trn-2 finally contained 14,479 training samples. It is particularly noteworthy that we did not use the line images themselves from the data provided in HTRtS-2015, because they cover more distortions between adjacent text lines."}, {"heading": "2.4.2 Network Training", "text": "In both training programs, different networks were trained in a similar way: the number of training periods varied slightly between 50 and 60, and the decrease in learning rates was chosen accordingly. Furthermore, different experiments differed in certain hyperparameters (number of neurons, subsampling rate) and random selections of baseline weights, which were then optimized by gradient descent procedures. Finally, from a larger number of experiments, 10 networks were selected, monitoring training success on the basis of a validation dataset selected from the available training data due to the lack of separate data, see 2.4.1."}, {"heading": "2.5 Decoding Schemes", "text": "2.5.1 Dec-BP: Best Path decodingTwo basic transformations must also be applied to decode the confidence matrix: 1. Replace repeated occurrences of the same character with only one! 2. Delete all NaC symbols! serves to distinguish between correct character repetition and only repeated viewing of the same character while using the line image.Note also that these operations are often used in all decoding schemes! Below, we know how to proceed (or traverse) the confidence matrix from a character sequence to a valid string interpretation as a required recognition result. 2.5.2 Dec-CE: CITlab Expression decodingThe details of this decoding developed at CITlab will be ictionary."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "First of all, the CITlab team would like to thank our long-standing technology and development partner PLANET intelligent systems GmbH (Raben Steinfeld, Germany) for their extremely valuable and continuous support in all aspects of this work, without which participation in HTRtS-2015 would not have been possible! In particular, we have continued the software world of PLANET, which has been developed and substantially improved in various joint CITlab-PLANET projects over the past years. We would like to thank him in particular for the ongoing very helpful discussions and his continuous development support. As part of our current research and development project, this work was funded by the funding number KF2622304SS3 (cooperation project) of the Central Innovation Programme for SMEs (ZIM) of the Federal Republic of Germany (BMWi).
