Literature Review", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1. Sufficient data for falls", "text": "Most research in the field of fall detection focuses on the application of monitored classification methods. In this paper, such techniques are not reviewed and interested readers can refer to the work cited in Section 2. Several studies on fall detection are based on swelling techniques [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 38], where raw or processed sensor data is compared with one or more predefined thresholds to detect a fall (see Taxonomy (I) b in Figure 1). Most of these techniques require training data for falls and use knowledge from other areas or data analysis techniques to calculate thresholds for their identification. The problem with swelling techniques for fall detection is that it is very difficult to adapt thresholds to new types of falls and generalize them between different people [43, 5]. More information on these methods can be found in the surveys discussed in Section 2."}, {"heading": "4.1.1. One-Class Classification", "text": "When sufficient case data is available, single-class classifiers can be trained on falls to reject normal activities (see taxonomy (I) c in Figure 1). However, in realistic environments, such a strategy is highly unlikely, as the availability of sufficient real case data is difficult. Zhang et al. [44] train OSVM on falls and runaways from non-case ADL and show that falls can be effectively detected. Yu et al. [45] propose to train Fuzzy OSVM on fall activities captured by video cameras, and to optimize parameters based on falls and some non-case activities. Their method assigns blurred membership to different training samples to reflect their importance in classification and shows that they perform better than OSVM. Yu et al. [46] introduce a video-based fall detection system for older people. They extract multiple video functions and apply OCC techniques to determine whether falls are centered or located in new instances of OSVM, such as the ability to centralize or to test for new instances of fall."}, {"heading": "4.2. Insufficient data for falls", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.2.1. Sampling Techniques", "text": "In some situations, few real falls may be available during the training phase (see taxonomy (II) a in Figure 1). In these cases, Stone and Skubic [14] represent a two-stage fall detection system. In the first stage, the vertical state of a person is characterized in individual depth frame frames, followed by an ensemble of decision trees to calculate confidence in the occurrence of a fall. The data they collect have a fall ratio of 1: 400 compared to normal activities. They support normal activities s.t. The ratio is reduced to 1: 40 and forms a decision tree ensemble. The activities examined in their analysis are standing, sitting and lying positions, close (within 4 m) to far-falling locations, and occur in comparison to non-occurring falls and report better results compared to standard methods. Debard et al. [32] Falls represent an actual use where the data collected for the weighted areas of the M-balance are not weighted."}, {"heading": "4.2.2. Semi-Supervised Techniques", "text": "Manual tagging of activities can be very cumbersome, tedious and time-consuming. In most cases, in addition to some labeled data, there is a wealth of unlabeled data; such a case requires the introduction of semi-supervised methods for detecting falls (see Taxonomy (II) b in Figure 1). Liu et al. [49] present a semi-supervised learning mechanism based on surveillance to detect falls and other ADLs to overcome the exhaustive labeling of human activities, using spatial field constraint energy to support SVM-based interaction decisions with a Bayesian inference model, followed by a semi-supervised step to retrain the classifier by automatically noting the activities with the highest confidence. However, their method is sensitive to environmental changes and needs to be retrained in new situations. Fahmi et al al al al al. [50] present a semi-supervised case monitoring method using smartphones, first developing a multifiltered algorithm based on medley decision-room, then a semi-based algorithm."}, {"heading": "4.2.3. Cost Sensitive Classification and Decision Theory", "text": "The problem of lack of recognition is a good example of unbalanced learning methods, because the data for normal activities is easy to collect and sufficiently available compared to other cases. Traditionally maintained algorithms, however, expect balanced datasets to be dominated by the majority class. In order to deal with unbalanced classes, these algorithms will not be able to represent characteristics of the data and provide unfavorable accuracies when presented with unbalanced datasets [54], and their predictions can be dominated by the majority class. To deal with unbalanced classes, a cost-sensitive classification is carried out, in which the different costs in a classification are addressed problematically. This can be done either by presenting different cost matrix to a free classification or by changing the inner workings of a classification."}, {"heading": "5. Detecting Falls in the Absence of their Training Data", "text": "In a realistic environment, due to the lack of sufficient data for falls and the lack of knowledge and understanding of what these falls might be, approaches for detecting outliers / abnormalities (see Taxonomy (II) d in Figure 1) and single-class classifications (see Taxonomy (II) e in Figure 1) can be used. These techniques cannot directly identify falls because case samples are not available to classifiers during the training phase; however, they can indirectly identify falls as abnormal (or non-normal) activity. In these approaches, deviations from normal behavior are labeled as abnormal activity. Falls are one of the most common abnormal activities; therefore, such techniques can be adapted for detecting falls. However, the concept of normal activity must be clearly defined because any abnormal activity may not be a fall. If the data of normal activity is insufficient, then such techniques may cause excessive false alarms; however, new research shows that we can only identify them as normal falls based on [63, 65] or that they can be studied in models that are not in the past."}, {"heading": "5.1. Studies on Detecting Falls as Anomalies", "text": "In fact, most people are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "5.2. Studies on Anomaly Detection not Specifically Focused on Fall Detection", "text": "We discussed in Section 3 that fall detection methods in Category (II) (see taxonomy (II) d and (II) e in Figure 1) do not directly detect falls because either the training data for falls is insufficient or is missing during training. In such a scenario, a plausible approach is to identify a fall as an abnormal activity (or anomaly) that we discussed in the above section. Alternatively, several methods for detecting abnormal activity that are not specific to fall detection can also be adapted so that a fall can be identified as one of the abnormal activity or anomaly. Now, we are reviewing several abnormal activity detection techniques that collect data from either vision-based or portable sensors; only require training data from normal activities to learn the models and be able to identify abnormal activities. These methods may very well be adapted to the task of fall detection."}, {"heading": "5.2.1.
