ABSTRACTION AND HEURISTIC", "text": "In this section, we present the abstraction we use and the heuristics induced by it. The main goal of heuristics is to provide an estimate of the distance from a state to a destination without calculating the parallel composition. However, in order to provide informative estimates of the effects of synchronization, the effects must be taken into account up to a certain point. Therefore, we build an abstraction of the environment that, instead of looking at the cross-product of states, affects state quantities. More specifically, if the states contained in the set can be synchronized (with the standard parallel composition), then the synchronization action must be available from the set. At first glance, looking at the state strength of states may seem detrimental, but we also apply a rule of monotonous growth. That is, the attainable state sets are limited units containing all the states traversed from the starting state. Thus, the abstraction size in relation to the number of states we use in order to achieve the polynode length of the component in order to estimate the component."}, {"heading": "A.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we present DCS, a method that looks for a controller that explores the state space on the fly, guided by domain-independent heuristics. The method is better both in time and memory than other approaches to the selected case study, despite its complexity. The approach eschews maximization, as accessibility goals allow targeted search in a reduced part of the state space. Therefore, despite our efforts to keep the approach as general as possible, further experiments are needed to properly assess the universality of the technique. For this reason, we plan to work on automatic translations to simplify the comparison with other tools.These preliminary results show promise and therefore we intend to expand the technique. Our primary concern is to address general liability issues, as the application of the synthesis controller's requirements in such domains indicates."}], "references": [{"title": "Supervisory Control of a Class of Discrete Event Processes", "author": ["P.J.
