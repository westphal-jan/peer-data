We allow the construction of arguments whose deontic conclusions are candidates for separation. Next, we define a number of ways in which these arguments can attack each other, as if the conclusions of two arguments contradict each other. We borrow Dung's semantics [6] to evaluate arguments in relation to the attack relationships that exist between them. Conclusions of arguments that are evaluated positively are certainly separable within our framework. They can be interpreted as all-encompassing obligations - following Ross [28] - or spending obligations - following Makinson & van der Torre [18, 19].

A detailed examination of, for example, different approaches to prioritized reasoning or different concepts of specifically based conflict resolution is reserved for an extended accompanying paper. We conclude by mentioning three challenges for future research: the first is to include approval declarations; the second is to increase the \"logic\" of 15 other solutions to this problem, e.g. in [33]. Our framework is enhanced by allowing nesting and the truth-functional combination of formulas OA, A, B or A. The third is to broaden our focus beyond substantiated extensions and examine how our framework behaves when subjected to different kinds of acceptable reasoning."}], "references": [{"title": "Dialogues and HY-arguments", "author": ["M.
