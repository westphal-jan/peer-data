However the advances conceal equally important limitations in their reliance on: massive data sets; fortuitously constructed problems; and absence of any human-level complexity, including other human opponents. On the other hand, deep learning systems which do beat human champions, such as in Go, do not generalise well. The power of deep learning simultaneously exposes its weakness. Given that deep learning is mostly clever reconfigurations of well-established methods, moving beyond the state of art calls for forward-thinking visionary solutions, not just more of the same. I present the argument that general game playing artificial intelligence will require a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently human artefacts which therefore, as a class of problems, contain cases which require a human-style problem solving approach. I relate this argument to the performance of state of art general game playing agents. I then describe a concept for a formal category theoretic basis to a generalised player model. This formal model approach integrates my existing 'Behavlets' method for psychologically-derived player modelling:", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 19:07:48 GMT  (20kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00401v1", "Submitted to 2016 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games. 7 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 13:15:53 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00401v2", "Submitted to 2016 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games. 7 pages"], ["v3", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 12:18:24 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00401v3", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to 2016 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games. 7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI", "authors": ["benjamin ultan cowley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.00401"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.00401.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "How to advance general game playing artificial intelligence by player modelling", "authors": ["Benjamin Ultan Cowley"], "emails": ["ben.cowley@helsinki.fi"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The fact is that we will be able to assert ourselves, that we are able to change and change the world."}, {"heading": "A. Behavlets", "text": "A general model should provide insight into various facets of the player's behavior, for example, the cognitive information processing style of a player. It therefore requires a foundation of parameters that describe the subjective experience of the game. It will draw on established modeling tools, including at least: i) behavioral psychology; ii) general game design; and iii) actions in the context of a given game. I have already proposed the Behavlet Method [7] to incorporate facets i) to iii) above into composite features of the game that are defined across entire action sequences. The goal is to create features of the player model that are associated with valid psychological theory. The Behavlet Process integrates descriptive models for temperament theory, game design patterns, and patterns of player actions. The core concept is to capture behaviors with a certain known personality bias, such as aggression, caution, and thus observe the player's self-expression."}, {"heading": "B. Formalism", "text": "As one best represents them (or any other psychological model), the way in which the individual systems are examined is also crucial.

Summary", "text": "In this essay, I intend to provide a notation to present behaviors as action sequences in a formally defined simulation of a game system by extension [11]. The motivation is to create a representation of possible player actions and the archetypal behavioral traits that can shape these actions so that representation can be used as input for a learning system. Ultimately, the goal is to learn from real human behavior. Later in the essay, I will first give a brief literature review in the next section. In Section III, I will describe a formal model of a game system, before briefly showing in Section V how it can be used to represent some behaviors from [7]. Finally, in Section VI, I will suggest some future directions of work."}, {"heading": "II.

Complete Model", "text": "Based on this framework, I propose a modeling scheme for the game behavior that is descriptive rather than generative; i.e., the goal is to simulate the game components that relate to the player's actions, rather than deriving a simulation of the game behavior from a model of the game mechanics.Definition: Game G is also a composition of HCSs \u03a6X i, 1 < i \u2264 k, with each game pattern used to model a specific game pattern, and the composition (by the properties of the composition of monoids) is also an HCS.The \"base\" -MonoidX0 represents the core game framework, without circulation restrictions. A single game pattern is represented by a monoid pattern: (Xi, Mi, i), which is represented by an orbit OX i i, with a starting condition (q, x0), i, corresponds to the opening state of the game qi, an initial state of Xi."}, {"heading": "IV. BEHAVLETS-BASED FORMAL MODEL", "text": "As already mentioned, the intention is to formalize the behavilet method of player modeling. As stated in the formal model definition, this can be done by using orbits to represent the game patterns that occur in the game. Here, I describe this idea. To select this game pattern, one essentially has to select a game pattern associated with a temperament trait. Therefore, a well-chosen monoid representation of a pattern that corresponds to the behavilet logic defined in [7] is also a behavilet start state (q, x0) i equivalent to the behavilet concept of limited hardness defined in [7].An example illustrates the approach for which I am already peer-reviewed [9] and empirically tested."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "The approach I have described for a generalized player model relies on the behavioral method to create psychologically grounded characteristics of the game and redefines them as parts of a formal category theory model. The value of this approach is that behavioral models of certain games can be further generalized under a formal framework through the use of simulations."}, {"heading": "A. Potential applications", "text": "The primary use case for the described method is to record the variation of the player. Consider that if we model behaviors as elements of the game \u03a6X, then through the Behavlets method [7], each \u03a6X i will have a related behavioral trait. Thus, a game instance with a certain component of the game style can reflect the \"character\" of a particular player. Potentially, characteristics of the human game can be learned through enough such instances. It should also be noted that the method allows for abstraction and specificity: we can build a canonical game model and also simulate game instances quite simply from the same definitions, which allows the exploration of the space of possible game elements. This could be called personality profiling, but skill and strategy are also relevant considerations. Based on the work of [5], where the human being achieves near optimal solutions to hard problems, we can expect that the human skills provide the seeds for improved computer-based solutions."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "I argue that in order to promote general artificial intelligence play, it is necessary to include the player's perspective, since games are ultimately human artifacts and therefore contain cases that benefit from a human-style problem-solving approach, which implies the creation of a general player model. I have outlined a method for this based on integrating my previously published behaviors [7] with a formal game model, resulting in a vision for a general player model, not a complete and conclusive work that I hope will serve as an inspiration."}], "references": [{"title": "Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search", "author": ["D.

However the advances conceal equally important limitations in their reliance on: massive data sets; fortuitously constructed problems; and absence of any humanlevel complexity, including other human opponents. On the other hand, deep learning systems which do beat human champions, such as in Go, do not generalise well. The power of deep learning simultaneously exposes its weakness. Given that deep learning is mostly clever reconfigurations of well-established methods, moving beyond the state of art calls for forwardthinking visionary solutions, not just more of the same. I present the argument that general game playing artificial intelligence will require a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently human artefacts which therefore, as a class of problems, contain cases which require a human-style problem solving approach. I relate this argument to the performance of state of art general game playing agents. I then describe a concept for a formal category theoretic basis to a generalised player model. This formal model approach integrates my existing \u2019Behavlets\u2019 method for psychologically-derived player modelling: Cowley, B., & Charles, D. (2016).
