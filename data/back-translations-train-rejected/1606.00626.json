NTLs cause significant harm to the economy, as in some countries they may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed. The predominant research direction is employing artificial intelligence (AI) to solve this problem. Promising approaches have been reported falling into two categories: expert systems incorporating hand-crafted expert knowledge or machine learning, also called pattern recognition or data mining, which learns fraudulent consumption patterns from examples without being explicitly programmed. This paper first provides an overview about how NTLs are defined and their impact on economies. Next, it covers the fundamental pillars of AI relevant to this domain. It then surveys these research efforts in a comprehensive review of algorithms, features and data sets used. It finally identifies the key scientific and engineering challenges in NTL detection and suggests how they could be solved. We believe that those challenges have not sufficiently been addressed in past contributions and that covering those is necessary in order to advance NTL detection.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 11:14:47 GMT  (653kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00626v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Jul 2017 22:30:28 GMT  (272kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00626v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 04:25:54 GMT  (272kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00626v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["patrick glauner", "jorge augusto meira", "petko valtchev", "radu state", "franck bettinger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.00626"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.00626.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Challenge of Non-Technical Loss Detection using Artificial Intelligence: A Survey", "authors": ["Patrick Glauner", "Andre Boechat", "Lautaro Dolberg", "Jorge Meira", "Radu State", "Franck Bettinger", "Yves Rangoni", "Diogo Duarte"], "emails": ["first.last@uni.lu).", "first.last@choiceholding.com)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is a very complex matter."}, {"heading": "II. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE", "text": "The field of artificial intelligence (AI) seeks to both understand and build intelligent units [62]. This name was coined in 1955 during the preparations for the first AI conference at Darmouth College [39]. While most people think intuitively about robotics, AI has more applications, such as learning patterns from data. This chapter provides an overview of the AI methods relevant to NTL detection."}, {"heading": "A. Expert systems", "text": "Traditional AI systems were based on handmade rules. Such systems are also called expert systems because they incorporate expert knowledge into their decision-making process. While expert systems were initially successful in tasks such as diagnosing and treating nuclear reactor accidents [48] or deployment planning for autonomous underwater vehicles [33], they have the following shortcomings: (1) integrating expert knowledge into rules is a challenge, (2) many areas cannot be accurately described in rules, and (3) domain knowledge may change over time, requiring rule changes [31]. Nevertheless, expert systems are still used today."}, {"heading": "B. Machine learning", "text": "To avoid the inadequacies of expert systems, a diametrically opposed approach is to learn patterns from data, not from craft rules. This branch of AI is called machine learning or pattern recognition. Both approaches are valid and none is usually better or worse than the other in artificial intelligence [25]. Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed [50]. This characteristic has made it possible to significantly improve AI in various applications, such as handwritten digital recognition [35], facial expression recognition [71] or speech recognition [27]. Machine learning consists of three pillars: supervised, unsupervised and reinforced learning. The term data mining is strongly linked to machine learning, but has a broader scope, which includes data cleansing, data preprocessing and concrete applications.1) Restricted learning:"}, {"heading": "III. THE STATE OF THE ART", "text": "Detection of NTL can be treated as a specific case of fraud detection, for which a general overview is provided in [11] and [32]. It highlights expert systems and machine learning as key methods for detecting fraudulent behaviour in applications such as credit card fraud, computer intrusion and telecommunications fraud. This section focuses on an overview of existing AI methods for detecting NTLs. Readers are consulted for other surveys of previous efforts in this area [15] and [30]. Overviews of possible methods for manipulating a smart metering infrastructure can be found in [29] and [40]."}, {"heading": "A. Support Vector Machines", "text": "Support for Vector Machines (SVM) [69] is a state-of-the-art classification algorithm that is less susceptible to overuse. Consumption data from electricity customers of less than 400 highly unbalanced customers of approximately 260K customers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who each have 25 monthly meter totals between June 2006 and June 2008, are used in [43]. From these meter totals, the characteristics of daily average consumption per month are calculated. These characteristics are then normalized and used for training in an SVM with a Gaussian kernel. For this setting, a recall of 0.53 is achieved on the test bench. In addition, the credit rating (CWR) is used in [46]. It is calculated from the billing system of the electricity provider and reflected when a customer delays or avoids bills. CWR ranges from 0 to 5, where 5 is the maximum score."}, {"heading": "B. Neural networks", "text": "Neural networks [9] are loosely inspired by how the human brain works and allow complex hypotheses to be learned from the data. A grouping of five neural networks (NN) is trained in [41] using samples from a dataset with approximately 20K customers. Each neural network uses features calculated from the consumption time series plus custom, pre-calculated attributes. An accuracy of 0.626 and an accuracy of 0.686 are obtained from the test set. A dataset of approximately 22K customers is used in [17] to train a neural network. It uses the average consumption of the previous 12 months and other customer characteristics such as location, customer type, voltage and whether notes are read from the meter during this period. On the test set, an accuracy of 0.8717 is used, an accuracy of 0.6503 and a recall of 0.2947. Extreme learning machines (ELM weights) are neural networks that are read from one-sided to the other."}, {"heading": "C. Expert systems and fuzzy systems", "text": "Profiles of 80K low-voltage and 6K high-voltage customers in Malaysia having meter readings every 30 minutes over a period of 30 days are used in [47] for electricity theft and anomaly detection. A test recall of 0.55 is reported. This work refers to characteristics of [45], but it uses completely unclear logic that incorporates human expertise for detection. A database of ~ 700K Brazilian customers, ~ 31M monthly readings from January 2011 to January 2015 and ~ 400K inspection data are used. It deals with an industrial Boolean expert system and optimizes the unclear system parameters with stochaotic gradients."}, {"heading": "D. Genetic algorithms", "text": "The work in [43] and [46] is extended by the use of a genetic SVM in [44] for 1,171 customers, using a genetic algorithm to globally optimize the hyperparameters of SVM. Each chromosome contains the Lagrange multipliers (\u03b11,..., \u03b1i), the regulatory factor C, and the Gaussian kernel parameter \u03b3. This model achieves a test call of 0.62. A dataset of approximately 1.1 million customers is used in [18]. The paper identifies the much smaller sample of customers studied as the biggest challenge in NTL detection, and then proposes stratified samples to increase the number of inspections and minimize statistical discrepancy between them. The stratified sampling method is defined as a non-linear, limited optimization problem in which the total energy loss from power theft is minimized. This minimization problem is then solved with two (1) optimized algorithms and (2) algorithms first."}, {"heading": "E. Other methods", "text": "It builds graphics in the feature space and uses so-called \"prototypes\" or training samples, which become the roots of their optimal path tree nodes. Each graph node is classified on the basis of its most connected prototype. This approach is fundamentally different from most other learning algorithms such as SVMs or neural networks that learn hyperplanes. Optimal path forests do not learn parameters, which makes training faster but slower compared to parametric methods. They are used in [55] for 736 customers and achieve a test accuracy of 0.9021, which exceeds SMVs with Gaussian and linear cores, and a neural network that achieves test accuracies of 0.8893, 0.4540 and 0.5301."}, {"heading": "F. Summary", "text": "The most commonly used models include Boolean and blurred expert systems, SVMs, and neural networks. In addition, genetic methods, sacrificial and regression methods are used. The datasets range from 30 to 700K customers. However, the largest dataset of 1.1 million customers in [18] is not included in the table because only the variance is reduced and no other metric is available. Accuracy and retrieval are the most popular metrics in literature, ranging from 0.45 to 0.99 and from 0.29 to 1. Very few publications report the recall of their models, which ranges from 0.51 to 0.85. The challenges of finding representative metrics and comparing individual contributions are discussed in chapters IV-A and IV-F respectively."}, {"heading": "IV. CHALLENGES", "text": "The research outcomes discussed in the previous section point to several open challenges. These challenges do not relate to individual contributions, but are distributed among different contributions. In this section, we will focus on discussing these challenges necessary to advance the detection of NTL. Specifically, we will discuss common issues that have not received the necessary attention in previous research, and place them in the context of machine learning research as a whole."}, {"heading": "A. Class imbalance and evaluation metric", "text": "Unbalanced classes often appear in machine learning, but this fact is largely not addressed in the literature, which is well covered, for example, in [28] and [68]. Class imbalance also influences the choice of assessment metrics. Most NTL detection research such as [17], [18], [43], [54] and [66] ignore this topic and report high accuracy or callbacks. The following examples show why these performance metrics are not suitable for NTL detection in unbalanced data sets: for a test set with 1K customers, 999 of whom are regularly used, (1) a classifier that always predicts non-NTL data, an accuracy of 99.9%, whereas (2) a classifier that always predicts NTL data has a recall rate of 100%. While the classifier in the first example has a very high accuracy and a very intuitive NTL will never work, a very good TL will never work."}, {"heading": "B. Feature description", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is a method by which one can put oneself in the shoes of others. [34] This approach has led to breakthroughs in image analysis and speech recognition. [27] One possible method for overcoming the problem of NTL recognition is to find a way to take it upon oneself."}, {"heading": "D. Biased inspection results", "text": "In statistics, sampling has to represent the total population in order to draw valid conclusions. In statistics, and hence in machine learning, this is a long-standing problem, as discussed in [26]. In the preparatory work of [24], we found that the sample of previously examined customers may not be representative of all customers. One reason for this is, for example, that electricity utilities previously focused on specific neighborhoods where inspections were carried out. NTL classifiers trained on distorted inspection data may also be distorted. To our knowledge, this issue has not been addressed in the literature on NTL detection. Bias correction was first addressed in the field of computational learning theory [16]. We believe that it may be promising to explore in this direction. For example, a promising approach might be to re-work inspection data in order to be representative of the location and type of the customer."}, {"heading": "E. Scalability", "text": "The number of customers used in the research under investigation varies considerably. For example, [43] and [63] use fewer than a few hundred customers in training. [43] use a Gaussian kernel SVM, for which training is only feasible in realistic time for up to a few tens of thousands of customers in current implementations [14]. A regression model using the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse [59] is used in [63]. This model is also only scalable for up to a few tens of thousands of customers [50]. Models that are trained on up to a few tens of thousands of customers include [41] and [17] using neural networks. Training methods used in these papers do not normally scale to significantly larger customer databases. Larger databases with up to hundreds of thousands or millions of customers are used in [18] and [24] using an SVM with linear kernel or genetic algorithms to enable greater algorithms to be used by Google, we believe that a greater amount of algorithms will enable a more efficient use of data processing algorithms."}, {"heading": "F. Comparison of different methods", "text": "Comparing the different methods examined in this paper is difficult because they are tested on different sets of data as summarized in Table I. In many cases, the description of the data lacks basic characteristics such as the number of readings per customer, the proportion of NTL, etc. To make the results more comparable, joint efforts of different research groups are needed to improve the comparability of the performance of NTL detection systems on the basis of a comprehensive, freely available and sufficiently large dataset."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "In the literature, a variety of NTL detection methods are reported; expert systems and fuzzy systems are traditional detection models; in recent years, machine learning methods have become increasingly popular; the most commonly used methods are support vector machines and neural networks that outperform expert systems in most settings; these models are typically applied to characteristics calculated from customer usage profiles, such as average usage, maximum usage and change in usage in addition to characteristics of customer master data such as type of customer and connection type; orders of magnitude of databases used in the literature have a wide range from less than 100 to more than one million; in this survey, we have also identified the six main open challenges in NTL detection: dealing with unbalanced classes in the training data and selecting suitable evaluation metrics that describe features from the data; incorrect inspection results; the results we consider comparable with the results of the TL; and the results we consider available for the TL."}], "references": [{"title": "P", "author": ["M.

include electricity theft, faulty meters or billing errors has attracted increasing attention from researchers in electrical engineering and computer science. NTLs cause significant harm to the economy, as in some countries they may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed. The predominant research direction is employing artificial intelligence (AI) to solve this problem. Promising approaches have been reported falling into two categories: expert systems incorporating hand-crafted expert knowledge or machine learning, also called pattern recognition or data mining, which learns fraudulent consumption patterns from examples without being explicitly programmed. This paper first provides an overview about how NTLs are defined and their impact on economies. Next, it covers the fundamental pillars of AI relevant to this domain. It then surveys these research efforts in a comprehensive review of algorithms, features and data sets used. It finally identifies the key scientific and engineering challenges in NTL detection and suggests how they could be solved. We believe that those challenges have not sufficiently been addressed in past contributions and that covering those is necessary in order to advance NTL detection.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
