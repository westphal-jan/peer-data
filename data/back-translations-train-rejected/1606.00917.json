(2) We have opted for a system in which it only involves a limited number of jobs. (3) We have discussed it in the manner in which it concerns the classification of jobs that go beyond the existing k-NN pipelines. (3) To this end, we have an extension in the form of classifications for each of the 23 top-level SOC codes. (4) It concerns the classification of jobs in the corresponding top-level categories, which are then used in the existing k-NN pipeline, which leads to vertical classifiers. (5) We have chosen SVM as the coarse-level classifier because it is very important in the cascade of classification to achieve the top-level classes of text classification: they do not have the data and are based on sparse and high-dimensional classification of the classification of the M because it is very important to select the SVC classification (5)."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we described the existing semi-supervised, proximity-based, multi-class multi-label job title classification system currently in operation at CareerBuilder.com. We discussed the limitations of the system and proposed an extension in the form of a rough and fine-grained cascade architecture consisting of an SVM classifier and a k-NN classifier, which enables us to make progress toward our goal of having an automated O * NET job title taxonomy classification system and improving our parallel pipeline of finer-grained job title classifiers. Early A / B testing indicates that there is potential for increased visitor engagement on the site due to better, more precise and detailed job classifications. Our future work includes building the pipeline for fine-grained job title classification on the 4-digit O * NET SOC code, creating vertical classifiers for the job classifier A / B classifier job classifier, and finally, the publication of the PI for the job classifier A / B classifier."}, {"heading": "5.
