To send spam e-mails to a huge number of recipients, spam brokers and e-mail recipients, you only need to locate the e-mail addresses in chat rooms, websites, newsgroup archives, service provider directories, etc., is an important task of spam classification, which revolves around millions of people without much money [Androutsopoulos et al, 2006]. Anti-spam software companies and research groups that have been working on spam filters for some time have had limited success, mainly because spam filters are an adversarial classification task. In such tasks, a malicious adversary \"poisons\" the training data to miss a classification [Jorgensen et al, 2008]. To return spam e-mails to a huge number of recipients, mail recipients often resorts to spamming e-mails, or mass e-mailing."}, {"heading": "3 Corpus Preprocessing", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "3.4.1 Analyzing Temporal Features", "text": "As a novel solution to the spam problem, [Kiritchenko et al, 2004] used temporal characteristics of an e-mail to conventional content-based approaches to create a richer information space to work with. A simple example of a temporal characteristic retrievable from the message header timestamp is the day of the week or time of the day the e-mail was received. [Hao et al, 2009] presented temporal information in the form of temporal patterns, presented an algorithm for breaking down temporal patterns in an e-mail sequence, and described approaches for integrating temporal patterns into a content-based e-mail classification. [Hao et al, 2009] examined various spatial-temporal characteristics of e-mail senders, and explored ways to derive the reputation of an e-mail sender based only on such characteristics. To improve the state of things, they presented SNac's spatial-temporal characteristics to demonstrate that a spatial-sender classification system is robust in spatial senders."}, {"heading": "3.4.2 SMTP Path Analysis", "text": "SMTP path analysis works by learning about the \"spamminess\" or goodness of IP addresses by examining the history of e-mails sent via that IP address. SMTP traffic analysis, combined with traditional filters, improves the accuracy of filters. [Leiba et al, 2005] noted that studying IP addresses is useful and presented a new algorithm for learning the call of e-mail domains and IP addresses by studying the SMTP path used to transmit e-mails. Beverly and Sollins [Beverly and Sollins, 2008] examined a variety of characteristics of the SMTP flow and developed a spam classifier, \"SpamFlow,\" based on the statistical discriminatory power of these streams."}, {"heading": "3.4.3 Behavior Analysis", "text": "The behavior pattern of an e-mail is \"what the sender does when compiling or distributing e-mail.\" Legitimate e-mails predominantly have normal and meaningful behavior patterns, while spam e-mails exhibit abnormal or even contradictory behavior patterns. [Yeh et al, 2005] considered behavior patterns such as data forgery, time anomaly, relay anomaly, etc., and described them through meta-heuristics and used them as characteristics for the classification task. To detect spam and viruses as irregular monsters in the e-mail, [Hershkop, 2006] proposed some behavioral models, some of which were recipient frequency, group communication, the user's past activity histogram, etc. [Ramachandran and Feamster, 2006] examined spam behavior at the network level and found that most of the spam was received from a small number of regions of the IP address space."}, {"heading": "3.4.4 Analyzing Users Social Network", "text": "Social networks are very helpful in determining the trustworthiness of outsiders, and thus newer approaches to spam filtering have begun to exploit the interactions of social networks to differentiate between spam and ham. For their social network-based classification scheme, [Boykin and Roychowdhury, 2005] analyzed email header fields to construct a user's social network graph, and classified email messages based on the \"clustering coefficient\" of the graph subcomponent. The clustering coefficient is very low for spammers while it is high for a network of friends, and the algorithm proved immune to false positives and was able to correctly classify 50% of all emails. [Chirita et al, 2009] and [Golbeck and Hendler, 2004] further developed the idea of creating a social network graph to derive reputation ratings from individuals or email addresses."}, {"heading": "4 Methods for Mitigating E-mail Spam", "text": "Although there are \"social\" methods such as legal measures and personal measures (e.g. never responding to spam, never forwarding chain letters) to combat spam, they have so far seen a narrow effect on spam only by the number of spam messages received by users on a daily basis. Technical measures seem to be the most effective in fighting spam. Before machine learning, many different technical measures for spam filtering were used, such as - rules-based spam filtering, white lists, black lists, challenge response (C / R) systems, spam filtering, honey pots, OCR filters and many others, each with its own merits and demerits. Black lists, white lists, challenge response systems, etc., are origin techniques used by renowned filters. We briefly discuss some of these popular approaches: 4.1 Heuristic filters followed the \"knowledge engineering\" approach and were based on coded rules or heuristic knowledge."}, {"heading": "5 Machine Learning Approach to E-mail Spam filtering: The Algorithms", "text": "It is a subfield of computer science that explores the design and development of computer systems that automatically improve their performance in a task based on experience. Automatic email classification uses statistical approaches or machine learning techniques and aims to create a model or classification specifically for the task of filtering spam from a user stream that automatically improves their performance. Some of the mostpopular machine learning techniques to combat spam are Naive Bayes [M. Sahami, S. Dumais, D. Heckerman et al, 1998]. Support Vector Machines [] Woitaszek and Shaaban [2003], [Amayri and Bouguila, 2010], Decision Trees al, 2005]."}, {"heading": "6 Evaluation Measures and Benchmarks", "text": "If the number of legitimate messages and spam messages actually reflects the number of legitimate messages and spam messages that need to be classified, then we define the accuracy (Acc) and the error rate (Err) of the spam filters as -Acc (Acc) and the error (Err) of the spam filters as -Acc (Acc) and -S (Err) of the spam filters, which is considered both false positive and false negative. (L) However, the negative filtering implies asymmetrical error costs. Failure to identify a ham, i.e., false positive event is generally a more costly error than the absence of a spam (a false positive negative event)."}, {"heading": "7 Future Challenges and Conclusion", "text": "In fact, it is that it is a pure mental game in which it is a matter of understanding the world as it is, and as it is. It is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, and it is as it is, how it is, how it is, how it is, how it is, how it is, how it is, how it is, how it is, how it is."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "Future research will have to address the fact that email spam filtering is a co-evolutionary problem as the filter tries to increase its predictive accuracy, and spammers try to outdo the classifiers. Therefore, an effective approach should find a successful mechanism to identify the deviation or development of spam features. Of all the traditional approaches discussed so far, the only one that has been hugely successful against spam is content-based spam filtering. Fortunately, machine learning-based systems allow for learning and adaptation to new threats by responding to counterproactive measures taken by spammers. No single anti-spam solution could be the right answer. A multi-layered approach combining legal and technical solutions and more is likely to deal a fatal blow to such spam."}], "references": [{"title": "The Learning Behind Gmail Priority Inbox", "author": ["D Aberdeen", "A Slater"], "venue": "NIPS 2010 Workshop on Learning on Cores, Clusters and Clouds,", "citeRegEx": "Aberdeen and Slater,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Aberdeen and Slater", "year": 2011}, {"title": "A Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques for Phishing Detection", "author": ["S Abu-nimeh", "D Nappa", "X Wang", "S Nair"], "venue": "eCrime", "citeRegEx": "Abu.nimeh et al\\.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Abu.nimeh et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Identifying Potentially Useful Email Header Features for Email", "author": ["O Al-jarrah", "I Khater", "B Al-duwairi"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Al.jarrah et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Al.jarrah et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Content-Based Spam Filtering", "author": ["TA Almeida", "A Yamakami"], "venue": "The 2010 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Barcelona,", "citeRegEx": "Almeida and Yamakami,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Almeida and Yamakami", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Advances in Spam Filtering Techniques.
