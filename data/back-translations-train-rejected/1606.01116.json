Background", "text": "2.1. Noisy-OR Modeling The noisy-OR structure was introduced by Pearl 7 to reduce survey efforts in the construction of a Bayesian network. Heckerman and Breese 29 have included the general characteristics of the noisy-OR function and its generalizations in their definition of causal independence. Consider a binary variable Y with n binary parent variables Xi (see Figure 1-a). These variables can be either \"True\" (T) or \"False\" (F). Each Xi exerts its influence on a Bayesian network, X must be associated with a probability distribution p (Y)."}, {"heading": "3. Belief Noisy-OR model", "text": "We begin by discussing the uncertainty problem in NOR models. One of the existing approaches to express the uncertainty in NOR is the ImNOR model proposed by Fallet et al. 9. We will analyze the disadvantages of ImNOR and create a new NOR gate with the theory of belief functions.3.1. The uncertainty problem in the NOR structure is classically accepted that observations in the system are partially feasible. For example, it is difficult to determine whether an earthquake has occurred, especially when the size is small and the hypo center is deep. In such a case, there are some uncertainties about the state of the Boolean parent variables and it is intuitive for experts to give the ignorant modality. {T, F} Simon and Weber 26 have investigated a solution based on evidence network and the theory of belief functions to account for the uncertainty in the state of the binary parent variables in AND / OR."}, {"heading": "4. Network reliability analysis", "text": "In this section, we will discuss the application of BNOR to the problem of network reliability analysis. = > The definition of network reliability and the traditional Bayesian solution are recalled first. (Then, the reliability assessment strategy based on the BNOR model is detailed in detail.4.1. Network reliability and Bayesian network solutions are considered here as two-terminal reliability, defined as the probability that there is an operative path between source node n1 and sink node nN on the network. Nodes are assumed to be operational at any time, and edge failures are assumed to be statistically independent. Let graph G (N, E) represents a network in which N denotes the set of nodes and sink nodes nN. For the network shown in Figure 8-a, N = {n1, n2, n4}, E = {e1, e2, e3, e4}."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, the BNOR model is developed within the framework of belief functions as an extension of the traditional NOR model to express various types of uncertainty in the independent causal interactions. It has been proven that BNOR can be implemented to disseminate unsafe information through the use of Bayesian networking tools. In practice, BNOR is more flexible than existing NOR models because it provides a general Bayesian framework that allows us to adopt the exact inference algorithm in its original form without modification and then adjust necessary parameters to obtain results that meet the specific requirements of engineers. Finally, the application to the reliability problem of networked systems demonstrates the effectiveness of the BNOR model. BNOR is applicable to systems with binary variables. An extension of BNOR that adapts to multi-value variables should be considered a future development. Furthermore, the uncertainty of interlinkages in practice must not be given."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments.", "text": "This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.61135001, 61403310) and the study by the first author in France was supported by the China Scholarship Council."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "One difficulty faced in knowledge engineering for Bayesian Network (BN) is the quantification step where the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) are determined.
