Why it has these properties -- and whether they are intended to facilitate language learning -- is matter of contention. We argue that much of this disagreement stems from lack of a formal, guiding theory of how phonetic categories should best be taught to infant-like learners. In the absence of such a theory, researchers have relied on intuitions about learning to guide the argument. We use a formal theory of teaching, validated through experiments in other domains, as the basis for a detailed analysis of whether IDS is well-designed for teaching phonetic categories. Using the theory, we generate ideal data for teaching phonetic categories in English. We qualitatively compare the simulated teaching data with human IDS, finding that the teaching data exhibit many features of IDS, including some that have been taken as evidence IDS is not for teaching. The simulated data reveal potential pitfalls for experimentalists exploring the role of IDS in language learning. Focusing on different formants and phoneme sets leads to different conclusions, and the benefit of the teaching data to learners is not apparent until a sufficient number of examples have been provided. Finally, we investigate transfer of IDS to learning ADS. The teaching data improves classification of ADS data, but only for the learner they were generated to teach; not universally across all classes of learner. This research offers a theoretically-grounded framework that empowers experimentalists to systematically evaluate whether IDS is for teaching.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 00:59:41 GMT  (1234kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01175v1", "21 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["baxter s eaves jr", "naomi h feldman", "thomas l griffiths", "patrick shafto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.01175"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.01175.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Infant-directed speech is consistent with teaching", "authors": ["Baxter S.

These approaches overlook an important difficulty of the learning problem that infants face. Infants are not born knowing how many phonemes comprise their mother tongue, nor do they get a vertical feedback on which phonetic categories each component of utterances belongs to. To learn the places (means, \u00b5) and shapes (covariance matrices, appendix) of phonetic categories, infants must learn how many there are; and all of them infer which phonetic categories each example belongs to. Nature and the number of categories can be learned simultaneously using the Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM) process."}, {"heading": "Teaching", "text": "We use an existing teaching model that has been successfully used to capture human learning in a variety of scenarios that reflect the value of the hypothesis. [16, 17, 22, 23], among which optimal teaching data is derived from the inversion of the learning process. Instead of randomly picking data from the actual distribution, optimal data for teaching is sampled from the distribution that leads the learners to the correct conclusion. Thus, teaching involves guiding the learners to \"conclusions\"; not only toward the correct hypothesis, but away from alternatives. Mathematically, the teacher's goal is to maximize the subsequent probability that the learner will ultimately end up with the right hypothesis - in this case, the correct estimation of the mappings Z and the mixing parameters \u00b5 that represent the learners (all means \u00b5) and the variance matrices that express this idea - and allow there to be some stochasticity of teaching in the probability - that there is some probability in the teaching."}, {"heading": "Comparison with Human Infant-Directed Speech", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves.

Research has shown that people systematically vary their speech to different goals, with infant directed speech being a canonical example. It is natural to ask why. Is it for teaching? We have argued that a precise formalization of these hypotheses is a necessary step toward the answer. Building off work in social learning, our computational model of teaching phonemes illustrates limitations in existing literature. Our approach also points to a way forward, through the collection of more comprehensive datasets, and development of computational accounts that reflect the problems of learners and hypotheses posed by researchers.

"Infant-directed speech (IDS) has distinctive properties that differ from adultdirected speech (ADS). Why it has these properties \u2013 and whether they are intended to facilitate language learning \u2013 is matter of contention. We argue that much of this disagreement stems from lack of a formal, guiding theory of how phonetic categories should best be taught to infant-like learners. In the absence of such a theory, researchers have relied on intuitions about learning to guide the argument. We use a formal theory of teaching, validated through experiments in other domains, as the basis for a detailed analysis of whether IDS is well-designed for teaching phonetic categories. Using the theory, we generate ideal data for teaching phonetic categories in English. We qualitatively compare the simulated teaching data with human IDS, finding that the teaching data exhibit many features of IDS, including some that have been taken as evidence IDS is not for teaching. The simulated data reveal potential pitfalls for experimentalists exploring the role of IDS in language learning. Focusing on different formants and phoneme sets leads to different conclusions, and the benefit of the teaching data to learners is not apparent until a sufficient number of examples have been provided. Finally, we investigate transfer of IDS to learning ADS. The teaching data improves classification of ADS data, but only for the learner they were generated to teach; not universally across all classes of learner. This research offers a theoretically-grounded framework that empowers experimentalists to systematically evaluate whether IDS is for teaching.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
