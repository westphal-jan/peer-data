As usual, we used natural words as if they were variables. The type of string term is the number of occurrences of the delimiter \"1.\" I use lowercase letters from Latin. \"(for atomic string terms, I often use the standard convention of using words from the lexicon in place of such atomic string terms), lowercase letters roman letters a, b,.) for string terms without delimiters and lowercase letters greek letters, \u03b2, \u03b2."}, {"heading": "2.1 Formulas and sorts", "text": "We have already defined the type of a string term as the number of occurrences of the delimiter constant \"1.\" The type of a formula corresponds to the number of delimiters \"1\" that occur in its name. That is, a formula of the type n is assigned a string term of the form a0 + 1 +. + 1 + an (with all ai of the type 0 according to our notation convention). For a given grammar, its signature defines the grade of all atomic formulas occurring in grammar. We assume that the atomic formulas s, n, np, pp are assigned a grade 0 (some other atomic formulas, such as inf if they are used for Dutch verb clusters, have a grade 1). Table 1 shows how to calculate the type of complex formulas. All subformulas of a formula are assigned to one variety, so that if we calculate s (C / B) on the basis of its input formula, we obtain a type (C)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Natural deduction rules", "text": "Figures 1 and 2 indicate the natural deduction rules for the Lambek calculation and for the left-hull rules (the other winding rules follow the same pattern).The left-hull rules in Figure 2 correspond almost exactly to the interpretation of the formulas given in definitions 10 to 12."}, {"heading": "3 Proof nets", "text": "One of the objectives of proofreading in typological grammars is to list all possible measurements for a given sentence. The bureaucratic aspects of the subsequent proofreading make it difficult to use the subsequent calculation directly for this purpose, since the subsequent calculation allows for a large number of insignificant rule permutations. A somewhat better situation for the natural deduction is that the correction rules correspond directly to steps in the meaning composition, although there are still a large number of possible rule permutations for the \u2022 E and \u2022 KE rules. Correction networks are a way to present evidence that eliminates the \"bureaucratic\" aspects of subsequent corrections and simplifies the product rules of the Lambek calculation for the natural deduction. One of Morrill's open questions (2011) is whether the proofreading calculation has a correction calculation for the postponement."}, {"heading": "3.1 Links", "text": "Figures 3 and 4 show the linkages for displacement calculation structures. Each linkage connects three formulas to a central node. The formulas written above the central node of a linkage are the premises of the linkage, the formulas written below are its conclusions. The linear order of both the premises and the conclusions of a linkage is important. We distinguish between Par linkages, where the central node is filled in black, and tensor linkages, where the central node is not filled (this is the familiar distinction between tensor / par of multiplicative linear logic). Par nodes are further distinguished by an arrow pointing to the main formula of the linkage."}, {"heading": "3.2 Proof structures", "text": "A structure of evidence is a set of formulas and a set of linkages such as these. 1. Each linkage represents one of the linkages presented in Figures 3 and 4 (for specific values of A, B, C and k), 2. Each formula is the precondition for at most one linkage, 3. Each formula is the conclusion of at most one linkage. Formulas that are not the conclusion of a linkage are the hypotheses of the structure of evidence (the word \"conclusion\" is overloaded: we are talking about conclusions of evidence, conclusions of linkages and conclusions of evidence structures; if the intended use of the context is clear, I will use the word \"conclusion\" without further qualification). Entries of a structure of evidence are its hypotheses and the active conclusions of its linkages (i.e., the conclusions of all Par linkages in the structure of evidence are, except the implications, the arrow)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Abstract Proof Structures", "text": "The general strategy we follow to define a correctness criterion for evidence constructions is as follows: We first simplify some of the information that is irrelevant to deciding correctness in order to obtain abstract evidence constructions, then specify the correctness state of these abstract evidence constructions, using a graphic criterion that generalizes the evidence constants of the Lambek calculation from Moot & Puite (2002). A single vertex is a tensor tree, and a tensor tree is a connected, acyclic structure of tensor associations (to be more precise, the underlying undirected graph must be acyclic and connected). A single vertex is a tensor tree. In the face of an (abstract) evidence construction, its tensor trees are the maximum sub-structures that are tensor trees; that is simply the conjunction we get from the forest with the final construct of a single number of a 6."}, {"heading": "3.4 Contractions", "text": "The structural contractions Figure 8 shows the structural contractions. The \"+\" contraction essentially consists of two combs that combine the premises by a simple procedure from left to right. It is worth noting that some immediate consequences of this contraction are cited here: First, we simply eliminate trivial combs (which contain a single premise and a single conclusion, that is, if \u03b2 contains only a single premise) if their conclusion is the premise of another comb, and secondly, the structural contractions tensor trees to unique combs (this is no longer guaranteed once we add the synthetic connectives, as discussed in Section 4). The wrap operation \"\u00b7 k\" reflects the wrap operation at the level of abstract evidence structures, inserting \u03b2 to the separator indicated by k: If k, \"the premise must be 1 of type 0 (we replace the first sign by k and if)."}, {"heading": "3.5 Correctness of the calculus", "text": "We show that the two definitions of the proof net, contractibility and corresponding to a natural deduction proof codex = > > > contraction proof col, in order to establish that the contraction criterion is correct.

Axioms \u03b1: A correspond directly to the proofs with the required combs. Otherwise, we proceed with case analyses of the last rule of proof.

(2011, Chapter 5) (although addressing parasitic gaps in Section 5.5 would require a significant complication of the theory of evidence).The synthetic connectors by Morrill et al. (2011) require us to expand our methodology somewhat: as it is currently formulated, the proof-net calculation generates a single comb for each proof mesh. If we add the synthetic connectors, we can introduce a separator marker in a way that is only partially specified by the premise of the rule. For example, the condensation of (the widest) split A shown below is the set of strings that are achieved by inserting a separator symbol anywhere in front of other separator symbols (if any), and thus does not yield a unique contraction for this introduction rule."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a proof-net calculation for the postponement calculation and demonstrated its correctness.
