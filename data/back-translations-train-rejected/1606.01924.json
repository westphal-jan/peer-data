Therefore, improving the state of SSA is a global necessity, one that requires international cooperation, ever-expanding sensor networks, and the analysis and dissemination of SSA data. Achieving an ideal state of SSA is to achieve a general study of reality, in real time, to develop predictive awareness of the space environment. It is the study of the types of objects and their relationships in a particular domain. Formal methods and ontological categories in this philosophical discipline are often applied to computer and information science. Products are computational artifacts that represent the individuals, species and relationships of a domain. They represent objects and ontological categories that represent objects in this philosophical discipline."}, {"heading": "THE SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS DOMAIN", "text": "The universe of discourse, which needs to be expressed in an ontological framework, is the SSA domain. This paper defines situational awareness in space as situational awareness of the environments in orbit, near Earth and space. It includes the processes by which we attain this awareness, such as observation, detection, identification, tracking and prediction / propagation of space objects and orbits and trajectories of space objects; as well as the phenomena in the space environment. At another point, SSA was defined as: \"the ability to observe, understand and predict the physical location of natural and artificial objects in orbit around the Earth, with the aim of avoiding collisions.\" [2] \"Understanding and perceiving the Earth's orbiting population, the space environment and possible threats.\" [3] \"[...] The ability to accurately characterize the space environment and activities in space.\" [4] The last quote summarizes a central area of SO that will be useful to further define the scope of SO."}, {"heading": "SSA Activities and Goals", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it is only a matter of time before a result is achieved."}, {"heading": "ONTOLOGY AND COMPUTATIONAL ONTOLOGIES", "text": "In fact, most of them are just one of many who are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "APPLYING ONTOLOGY TO SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS", "text": "It is indeed the case that we are able to go in search of a solution."}, {"heading": "A FORMALIZED SSA SCENARIO", "text": "In fact, it is as if it is.

Space object catalogs with satellite observation data can be provided with the appropriate ontology classes to enable the exchange and interoperability of space data."}], "references": [{"title": "Ontological Architecture for Orbital Debris Data.", "author": ["Rovetto", "Robert J"], "venue": "Earth Science Informatics", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Space Situational Awareness Fact Sheet", "author": ["Weeden", "Brian"], "venue": "(Sept", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Space Situational Awareness: The Big Picture", "author": ["Weeden", "Brian"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Global Space Situational Sensors,\" 2010 Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Conference, Maui, Hawaii, September 15- 17", "author": ["Weeden", "Brian", "Cefola", "Paul", "Sankaran J"], "venue": "URL= http://www.amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2010/Integrating_Diverse_Data/Weeden.pdf http://www.cissm.umd.edu/papers/display.php?id=541 (Accessed December", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Simulating Space Surveillance Networks.
