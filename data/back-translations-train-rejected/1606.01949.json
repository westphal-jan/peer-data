An early paper on the planning of household appliances using computational markets was presented by Ygge in [YA96]. An overview of demand control solutions is presented in [PD11], while challenges in the development of market platforms and smart agents for smart grid control are discussed in [RVRJ12, KWK05, LBF10]. So far, different mechanisms for trading energy [SHPB12], cooperative games [ARR13] and on the basis of cost minimization and non-cooperative games [KWK05, AW14, CYN14, MRWJ + 10] have been used in particular for duplicate auctions (DA) [VRV + 10, IDSKG12, WSH + 14]. While energy trading in electricity grids as a method for coordinating energy resources is widely used in energy systems, and therefore, the use of computerized systems for trading has been widely developed, and the use of computerized systems as a way of managing energy resources is a way of trading."}, {"heading": "3 Problem statement", "text": "This study concerns the design of a microgrid controller, i.e. an agent that controls the energy that is exchanged with and in the local power grid."}, {"heading": "3.1 Modeling electrical loads", "text": "Each device is a collection of services, each described by an operating model and a usage model [MZE14, EMKE15]. In addition, the operating model describes the coordinated execution of the system components in the form of a state sequence, in which a state is defined as peak power Pi-N + and a duration di-N + in seconds. Furthermore, each state is associated with a start delay sensitivity, which defines the maximum tolerated start delay in seconds and an interruption sensitivity, in which the severity under which state operation can be interrupted is defined. The start delay sensitivity models the device delay sensitivity for the initial state, and the state sensitivity for the start delay sensitivity are different. These values affect the comfort of the user and correct device operation. it is also important to note that device services are classified as inflexible or inflexible due to their start delay sensitivity."}, {"heading": "3.2 Designing a power broker", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have established over the last five years."}, {"heading": "3.3 Efficient Power allocation", "text": "In order to identify the load that best meets the formulated price vector, i.e., the candidate associates the highest value of the available power, we can use market-based mechanisms. One possibility is to consider the formulated price vector as a reserve price and choose a price for progressive price uncertainty. As a customer breaks off the auction at a certain price, we can better assess its benefits than the offer. This leads to an easier process to determine the quantity of the purchase."}, {"heading": "4 Experiment", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Evaluation metrics", "text": "In this study, we attempt to compare the performance of different broker models. In particular, we have identified the following key indicators: Peak-to-average ratio The PAR is calculated as the ratio of peak power to average over the time window under consideration. This factor describes the proportion of peak power over aggregate demand and has a direct impact on the loss of the likelihood of load. It is therefore desirable to keep this value as low as possible, since a high PAR determines the reliability of the system and thus the inefficiency [LYH + 14].Service availability is the proportion of time in which a system is in working condition."}, {"heading": "4.2 Research questions", "text": "As previously introduced, the broker seeks to maximize profit by correctly formulating the retail price of multiple deployment periods. As costs are determined by the get-and-fit plans, this leads to a correct reflection of future supply costs and expected demand in the retail price. This leads directly to the following distinction: i) a pessimistic broker who calculates SLAs proportionately to their duration (the longer the reserve, the higher the price), and ii) an optimistic broker who maintains the same price for all SLA terms. These strategies are useful as baseline reference. Accordingly, the pessimistic broker largely agrees with individual SLAs (i.e., the shortest price available), highlighting the problems of market competition and service disruption that motivate this study. On the other hand, the optimistic broker attributes the same uncertainty to all SLA terms (i.e., the shortest available price), which can lead to the most economically naive loss of such a number."}, {"heading": "4.3 Setup", "text": "The performance of our approach depends on the consumption scenario in question, i.e. the number and type of loads, their usage model, etc. In order to fully control the simulation and evaluate different scenarios, we use synthetic performance data calculated using models from RAPSim [PKE14]. In detail, the calculation takes into account the width, length, area and efficiency of the devices as well as a cloud coverage model to calculate sunlight intensity. Consumption data comes from building 2 of [MEE + 14], which models the usage behaviour of a retired couple with an adult son. In particular, we chose the following devices: TV, dishwasher, tumble dryer, washing machine, refrigerator and coffee maker. A low-pass filter was applied to the measurements and a peripheral time detection was used to identify device events (see Fig 1)."}, {"heading": "5 The value of coordination and provisioning contracts", "text": "In order to evaluate the optimistic and pessimistic market participants, we first disable market-based allocation by setting the price sensitivity of all loads at 0.9 AC / kWh. Selected commission periods are: a uniform agreement requiring the immediate absence of the broker, namely 10, 30, 120, 600 and 1800 seconds. The scenario was simulated using the performance measurements of Building 2 in the first week of 2015 (i.e., January to January 7). We then vary the amount of grids available to the broker: Plan1: 0, Plan2: 1.5 kW, Plan3 kW in the second week until 6 pm and 1 kW otherwise, Plan4 kW and Plan5: 6 kW. Production depends on two different weather models (see Figure 6)."}, {"heading": "6 Modeling supply and demand to improve profit", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Broker modeling and training", "text": "As we have seen it, we must strive for effective profit maximization, in order to adapt the broker's behavior to the expected sequence of events that take place in each area. \"The way we do it,\" says the author, \"is the way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\" \"The way we do it.\""}, {"heading": "6.2 Brokers for specific scenarios", "text": "In the first experiment, we evaluate the fitness landscape using different scenarios, namely: i) different grid usage plans and ii) different seasonal and weather conditions. Fig. 1012 shows the fitness landscape for the proposed model over the winter (Fig. 10a) and the summer season (Fig. 10b). Differences in the availability of renewable energy determine the different suitability of the broker. The experiment continues by evaluating the different brokerage models in each training scenario, using the selected price measures. This allows a comparison of the trained brokers against the rule-based brokers. Accordingly, we select the best candidate network (i.e., in the latest generation) for use over 1 day and 1 week respectively. In addition, the trained brokers were placed under ideal and real weather conditions (i.e., as in their simulation use)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and future work", "text": "In fact, the majority of people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move"}], "references": [{"title": "Auctioning many divisible goods", "author": ["Lawrence M.
