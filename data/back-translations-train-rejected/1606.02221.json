The lowest number of resources that meets this requirement is the lower limit required to protect each target, while the upper limit is the number of resources, so that for each signal there is a response strategy that covers all targets in T psq, giving the Defender a benefit of 1.

To simplify the presentation, we assume that only one signal s is present in S, and that T-psq \"T, where s is omitted in our formulas, is placed at pi-P. The general case of multiple signals can be achieved by simply refining the notation; the additional computing costs due to signals are linear in their numbers.Generally, each resource i always moves along a coverage route. Let's call Ri the series of coverage routes for resource i, starting with pi (we will omit the onpi dependency, since P is always fixed to the extent of a signal response game).To calculate the coverage routes, we use the exact and approximate methods proposed in Strat5co [2015al]."}, {"heading": "4.1 Full coordination SRO (FC\u2013SRO)", "text": "In other words, D has full control over the resources at any time of the game. It calculates a common strategy for them and moves them together on the graph following it. This scheme can describe scenarios in which resources are connected to a central control unit from which commands are issued (e.g. police patrols equipped with radio transmitters).The security game resulting from this scheme is played by D and A. In which the number of resources connected to a central control unit is the probability of playing the common coverage route. We define Ipr as a function that returns when and only when the target t is protected by r (we allow r to be both a common and a single resource covering route) and 0 otherwise."}, {"heading": "4.2 Partial coordination SRO (PC\u2013SRO)", "text": "Another way to see this is to consider each resource as a separate player who is interested in working with others but cannot correlate with them. However, real scenarios that fall into this area can be characterized by resources for which communication with the control unit is not available (e.g. patrol units operating in stealth mode).Team games [by Stengel and Koller, 1997] are a suitable model to describe our security game under this coordination scheme. We define an m '1 game for which resource player D1,..., Dm compete with other players operating in stealth mode. Each resource strategy is defined as a zip."}, {"heading": "4.3 No coordination SRO (NC\u2013SRO)", "text": "If coordination between resources is not allowed, we exclude not only strategic correlation, but also joint planning. In this scenario, the resources are unaware and act as individual actors against A.

Let's start by solving the problem of finding the minimum resource placement by solving the associated SET-COVER formulation (or our polynomic algorithm with trees and cycles). If the problem cannot be solved exactly in a short time, we apply the greedy approximation algorithm of [Chvatal, 1979] and then apply a simple local search to improve the greedy solution. Once this step is complete, we have determined a number of resources and we solve the problem of finding the best allocation strategy for them. As mentioned above, the best allocation strategy, when no signal is triggered, is to place the m resources statically in the best coverage placement. Such placement is defined as the one from which the signal response game delivers the maximum expected benefit."}, {"heading": "6 Experimental evaluations", "text": "It is a single signal that covers the worst cases in relation to the terminology that we have collected, because we are discussing with the representatives of the Italian State Police. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \".\" \"\" We. \".\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We.. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We..\" \"\" \"We..\" \"\" We.. \"\" \"\" We.. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We..\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We..\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We.. \"\" \"\" We.. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We.. \"\" \"\" We.. \"\" \"We..\" \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We..\" \"\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We.\" We. \""}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and future research", "text": "In this thesis, we considered a security game with the presence of a spatially imperfect alarm system and addressed the novel generalization of settings in which the Defender can control multiple mobile resources. We proposed a solution for dealing with the new algorithmic problems that such a generalization entails. First, we addressed the problem of calculating the minimum number of resources required in a given environment, and then determining the best signal response strategy among different resource coordination schemes. Future research will include adapting our algorithms to cases where the number of resources available to D is greater than the resources required for minimal coverage of the placement. In addition, we plan to work on the model by allowing the presence of mispositions and missed detections in the alarm systems as well as the presence of multiple resources on the part of the attacker. These enhancements are, of course, driven by real requirements that security games must meet."}], "references": [{"title": "In 2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation", "author": ["Noa Agmon", "Sarit Kraus", "Gal A.
