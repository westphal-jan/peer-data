To bridge this research gap, we propose a relation algebra method for international relations computation. The proposed method will allow a relation computation which is previously subjective and incomputable. We also present three international relations as case studies to demonstrate the proposed method is a real-world scenario. The method will deliver the relation computation for the international relations that to support decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense ministry, presidential or prime minister office.

In order to explore trust issues, we have examined existing literature that finds trust (e.g. definition, formalism and theory) and international relations (J.Wheeler, 2012; Jelenc and Tr\u010dek, 2014; Mcknight and Chervany, 2001) in politics and in the social sciences, trust and international relations in philosophical forms subject to the ambiguity of natural languages."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "This section discusses the definitions of trust and its modeling in the sub-domains. The keywords \"trust\" and \"relationship\" provide many definitions in different disciplines. Searching for the keywords in a search engine shows that the definition of trust in a specific situation or state (Mcknight and Chervany) is important. Later, the definitions related to expansion in computer science are developed. A relationship of trust in social science can be understood as an expectation of others. (Mcknight and Chervany, 1996)."}, {"heading": "Trust Modeling", "text": "In order to enable the calculation of relations in computer systems, the definitions of trust must be communicated in a measurable or quantifiable notation such as statistical representations. (Dempster, 1967) The first attempt to represent trust in statistical representations was made by (Dempster, 1967).Dempster demonstrated a probability measurement, which consists in defining a higher and a lower probability for a complex mapping. Probability measurement is a generalization of the calculation in Bayesian theory. Its statistical scheme is adopted by (Shafer, 1979, 1976) and represents an elegant method for calculating trust. Later (in the years 1980-1995) many researchers treated both works as the basis for a concrete relation calculation, which they called the Dempster-Shafer theory in the early 1980s (Shafer, 2015).Later (J\u00f8sang, 1997) they extended a probability calculation for the Dempster-Shaper theory by introducing an artificial sensation theory."}, {"heading": "Bayesian Theory", "text": "The Bayean theory is often used in probability studies such as statistical inference, which is a process of drawing a conclusion from given hypotheses using data taken from a population. By the statistical inference, a probability of hypotheses being either true, false, or unknown can be derived using Bayean probability, which can be calculated using Bayean inference (or rule), which allows an update of the probability of a given hypothesis when new evidence is found, and contributes to a non-monotonous logic (1992) which enables a cautious conclusion (previously derived conclusion) when the new evidence invalidates the cautious conclusion. This formal logic is used in an artificially intelligent (AI) study to make a decision when past experiences and new experiences are gathered."}, {"heading": "Dempster-Shafer Theory", "text": "The belief function (Shafer, 1976) measures the degree of faith (or mass) in a question using the subjective probability for a related question. The degree of faith may not be tied to mathematical probabilities, and its probabilities depend on how closely related questions (or events) are to each other. Faith for a question can be combined with Dempster's rule that if the question relies on independent evidence objects, the belief function assigns a mass for each hypothesis (or question of interest). A total mass is a measurement of the total evidence (or belief of the given hypothesis H). The total mass that supports the given hypothesis H forms a lower limit of faith."}, {"heading": "Subjective Logic (Algebra)", "text": "Subjective logic (J\u00f8sang, 2015) is used to model and analyze incomplete information that involves uncertainty in a faith calculation, each faith being an accumulation of opinions in a finite state2. Opinions may contain a certain degree of uncertainty about its probability (J\u00f8sang, 2013). The degree of uncertainty can be interpreted as ignorance about the truth of a given state (or the actual probability). The calculation for subjective logic consists of an ordered quadrangle = (,,,) as an opinion that reads: is a mass of faith that a statement is true. Unbelief is a mass of faith that a statement is false. Uncertainty is neither true nor false of a given prognosis. Base rate is a binary probability with the absence of evidence. Where:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, is a statement is false. Uncertainty is a mass of faith that is neither true nor false of a given prognosis."}, {"heading": "Related Literatures", "text": "In fact, it is the case that you are able to move into another world, in which you have to move into another world, in which you have to move into another world, in which you can move into another world."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "In this section, we present a brief summary of our research work, starting with the development of research hypotheses.

Clustering or grouping related events for specific real estate reduces the complexity in determining the values of real estate and helps to shorten the search time of the entire data in public areas (e.g. Internet, news, etc.) If at least a single event related to the given real estate is found, the given real estate is included in a calculation of the relations. It may not be strong enough to provide solid evidence for the given real estate, but it will help to enable the calculation of the relationship. Dempster-Shafer's theory of evidence can also be applied to event verification, but it requires too much effort. Another problem with the real estate that has been assigned to one or more events can activate and deactivate (or switch over several times) during the observation period."}, {"heading": "Weightage", "text": "In fact, it is a way in which the United States and other countries are able to pursue and defend their own interests, including the United States of America."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, without being able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "Contribution and Future Work", "text": "The proposed method has enabled the calculation of relationships that were previously subjective and unquantifiable, working seamlessly with the existing trust methods, which are the Dempster-Shafer theory, Joseph's subjective logic, and Bayean theory. We have also submitted interesting case studies to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method. We believe that our method can help researchers who are researching international relations. Government officials working in the State or Defense Departments can use our method as a quantitative methodology for international trust evaluations. 7 We do not receive or use material that could lead to actions of a cybercrime, terrorism, espionage, or other illegal activity. The Defense Department can use our method to identify a nation that can be identified as trustworthy or neutral; or an enemy nation that can be considered a terrorist nation or insecure nation."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this thesis we have modeled the Relation Algebra for International Nations Relations. The purpose of the Relation Malaysia Algebra Method is to enable relationship calculations and trust modeling. Previously, there was no such method to perform the relationship calculations for international relations that are subjective and unquantifiable. We have also presented the international nation relations between USA-GBR, USA-IRN and USA-IND as case studies to demonstrate the proposed method in a real-world scenario. We have achieved our research goals by applying and verifying the relationship Algebra with the case studies. We plan to publish the relationship algebra for Common Criteria participating nations in the next publication.

It examined trust for international relations and its calculus, which related to Bayesian inference, Dempster-Shafer theory and subjective logic. Based on an observation in the literature, we found no literature discussing the calculus method for the international relations. To bridge this research gap, we propose a relation algebra method for international relations computation. The proposed method will allow a relation computation which is previously subjective and incomputable. We also present three international relations as case studies to demonstrate the proposed method is a real-world scenario. The method will deliver the relation computation for the international relations that to support decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense ministry, presidential or prime minister office. The Department of Defense (DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be identified as a friendly, neutral or hostile nation.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
