We argue that as we look into the future, wearable devices are going to be cheaper and more prevalent and textual data will play a more significant role. Data captured by lifelogging devices will increasingly include speech and text, potentially useful in analysis of intellectual activities. Analyzing what a person hears, reads, and sees, we should be able to measure the extent of cognitive activity devoted to a certain topic or subject by a learner. Test-based lifelog records can benefit from semantic analysis tools developed for natural language processing. We show how semantic analysis of such text data can be achieved through the use of taxonomic subject facets and how these facets might be useful in quantifying cognitive activity devoted to various topics in a person's day. We are currently developing a method to automatically create taxonomic topic vocabularies that can be applied to this detection of intellectual activity.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 08:11:54 GMT  (124kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02440v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.HC", "authors": ["gregory grefenstette", "lawrence muchemi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02440"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.02440.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the Place of Text Data in Lifelogs, and Text Analysis via Semantic Facets", "authors": ["Gregory Grefenstette", "Lawrence Muchemi"], "emails": ["gregory.grefenstette@inria.fr,", "lawrence.githiari@inria.fr."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "iConference 2016 YOU on LifeloggingOn the Place of Text Data in Lifelogs, and Text Analysis via Semantic FacetteGregory Grefenstette1, Lawrence Muchemi2 1INRIA, Saclay, France 2University of Nairobi, Kenya & INRIA, Saclay, France"}, {"heading": "Abstract", "text": "In recent years, the number of people who are able to draw attention to a particular topic or topic has more than doubled in recent years.
