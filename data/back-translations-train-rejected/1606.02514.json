Introduction", "text": "Definitions are the source of knowledge to consult when searching for the meaning of a term, but the manual creation and updating of glossaries is a costly task requiring the joint effort of domain experts (Navigli and Velardi, 2010). Using lexicographic information in the form of definitions has proven useful not only for glossary building (Muresan and Klavans, 2002; Park et al., 2002) or Question Answering (Cui et al., 2005; Saggion and Gaizauskas, 2004), but also more recently in tasks such as Hypernym Extraction (Espinosa-Anke et al., 2015b), Taxonomy Learning (Velardi et al., 2013; Espinosa-Anke et al., 2016) and Knowledge Base Generation (Delli Bovi et al., 2015)."}, {"heading": "2. Data Modelling", "text": "DEFEXT is a poorly supervised DE system based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) that trains a seed model based on a set of manually validated definitions and distractors, iteratively adding highly probable definitions and most likely undefined sentences, such as fragments of text that express a personal opinion. What sets DEFEXT apart from any monitored system is that, thanks to its iterative architecture (see Figure 1), it gradually identifies more suitable definitions with greater reach for non-standard text than a system trained only on WordNet glosses or Wikipedia definitions (experimental results supporting this claim are briefly discussed in Section 3)."}, {"heading": "2.1. Corpora", "text": "We publish DEFEXT together with two automatically commented data sets in column format, each row representing a word and each column a feature value, with the last column reserved for the token designation, which is in our DEF / NODEF setting. Sentence division is encoded as a double line break. These corpora are enriched versions of (1) The Word Class Lattices Corpus (Navigli et al., 2010) (WCLd); and (2) A subset of the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (Bird et al., 2008) (ACL-ARCd). Statistics on their size in tokens and sentences, as well as the definition distribution (in the case of WCLd) are contained in Table 1.ar Xiv: 160 6.02 514v 1 [cs.C L] 8J un2 016."}, {"heading": "2.2.

Bootstrapping", "text": "We have implemented on DEFEXT a bootstrapping approach inspired by the well-known Jarowsky algorithm for Word Sense Disambiguation (Jarowsky, 1995). It works as follows: Starting from a small set of seed-labeled examples (in our case, WCLd), a large target set of cases to be classified (ACL-ARCd), and a learning algorithm (CRF), the initial training is performed on the initial seed to classify all the target data. These highly-classified cases are appended to the training data until convergence or a number of maximum iterations is reached. We apply this methodology to the bootstrapping process and extract the highest confidence definition and highest confidence absence for each iteration from the target corpus, retrain and reclassify it."}, {"heading": "3. Experiments and Evaluation", "text": "In the course of the bootstrapping process, the trained models gradually become aware of the linguistic peculiarities of the genre and register of a target corpus, enabling the collection of fragments of definition with a specific syntactic structure that may not exist in the original seeds. In this section, we summarize the main conclusions from the experiments carried out using two pre-recorded test data sets, namely the W00 corpus (Jin et al., 2013) and the MSRNLP corpus (Espinosa-Anke et al., 2015c) 4. The former is a manually annotated subset of ACL anthology that exhibits high domain specificity as well as considerable variability in terms of the introduction and definition of a term (e.g. by comparison or by placing the defined term at the end of the sentence), the latter being manually composed from a series of abstracts available on the Microsoft Research website, i.e. the first set of cases to be an abstract plurality in the sentence, and thus the first one in the set of the plurality."}, {"heading": "3.1. Definition Extraction", "text": "Starting with the WCLd corpus as seed data and the ACLARCd collection for bootstrapping, we performed 200 iterations and recalculated precision, recall, and F score at record level for both the W00 and MSR NLP corpora for each iteration. At Iteration 100, we recalculated the statistical features of the bootstrapped training data (which included 200 additional sets, 100 from each label).The trend for both corpora shown in Figure 2 shows that the model improves in classifying definition knowledge in corpora with greater variability than the performance on the W00 corpus suggests."}, {"heading": "3.2. Human Evaluation", "text": "In this additional experiment, we evaluated the quality of the extracted definitions during the bootstrapping process. To this end, we performed 100 iterations of the ACL-ARCd4Available at http: / / taln.upf.edu / MSR-NLP RANLP2015 5http: / / academic.research.microsoft.com. 6Note that, for clarity's sake, we removed all meta information from the original data sets and presented experts in NLP 200 sentences (100 candidate definitions and 100 distractors) in mixed order. Note that since the ACL-ARC corpus is derived from parsing pdf papers, a considerable amount of noise arises from different formatting, the presence of equations or tables, and so on. However, all judgments were presented in their original form, including noise, as we found in many cases, even noise could give the reader an idea of the context in which the sentence was pronounced."}, {"heading": "3.3. Technical Details", "text": "As already mentioned, DEFEXT is a bootstrapping wrapper around the CRF + + toolkit, where input data must be pre-processed in column-based format. Specifically, each sentence is encoded as a matrix, with each word being a line and each attribute represented as a column, each of which is tab-separated. Normally, the surface shape or problem of the word will be in the first or second column, followed by other attributes such as language part, syntactic dependency, or body-based attributes. The last column in the record is the sentence name, which in DEFEXT is either DEF or NODEF, as it is designed as a sentence classification system. Once training and target data are appropriately pre-processed, DEFEXT can easily be invoked in any Unix machine. Further implementation details and command line arguments can be found in the documentation of the toolkit, as well as in the entire code."}, {"heading": "4. Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "We have presented DEFEXT, a system for weakly monitored DE at the sentence level. We have summarized the most outstanding features of the algorithm by pointing to experiments that have taken the NLP domain as a use case (EspinosaAnke et al., 2015c), and added an additional human evaluation to it. We have also covered the most important prerequisites for it to function properly, such as data format and command line arguments. No external Python libraries are required, and the only requirement is the installation of CRF + +. We hope that the research community in lexicography, computer lexicography or corpuslinguistics will find this tool useful, for example, to automate term and definition extraction, as support for glossary generation or hypernymic (is-a) relationship extraction."}, {"heading": "5.
