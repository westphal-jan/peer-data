Note that the source of four out of five of these records is the same set of midi files used in [BLBV12], which also provides pre-processed data. This work provided \"piano roll\" representations, which essentially consist of a regular temporal grid (period an eighth note) of on / off indicators for each midi note number. While piano roll is an excellent simplified music format for early studies of symbolic music modeling, it has several limitations, as discussed in previous work [Wal16]. To name such a limitation, the piano roll format does not explicitly represent the endings of notes and therefore cannot distinguish between, say, two consecutive eighth notes and a single quarter note. To address these limitations, we have extracted additional information from the same set of midi files."}, {"heading": "2 Preprocessing", "text": "We have applied the following processing steps and filters to the raw midi data. \u2022 Combining piano \"sustain pedal\" signals with key information to obtain an equivalent individual note on / off events. \u2022 Removing duplicate / overlapping notes occurring on the same midi channel (although technically not allowed, this still occurs in real midi data due to the permissive nature of the midi file format). \u2022 Removing midi channels with less than two note events (these occurred in the MUS and CMA records and were always information tracks containing authoring information and receipts, etc. \u2022 Removing midi channels with fewer than two note events (these occurred in the MUS and CMA records and were always information tracks containing authoring information and receipts, etc.). \u2022 Removing midi channels with less than two note events likely to intersect with a previously occurring MMA file event."}, {"heading": "3 Splits", "text": "The four sets of data used in [BLBV12] maintain the original training, testing and validation splits used in this work. For CMA, we took a cautious approach to data sharing. The main problem was data duplicates, since the midi archive provided to us contained several versions of several parts, each of which was slightly differently encoded by a different transcriptor. To reduce the statistical dependence between the traction, test and validation fragments of the CMA set, we used the following method: 1. We calculated a simple signature vector for each file consisting of the concatenation of two vectors, the first being the normalized histogram of the midi note numbers in the file. For the second vector, we quantified the event duration into a set of meaningful containers and calculated a normalized histogram of the resulting quantified duration."}, {"heading": "4 Basic Exploratory Plots", "text": "Figures 2-5 provide some basic exploratory diagrams; note that the note distribution and number of notes per piece diagram is self-explanatory; note that the number of pieces per piece (bottom left) is set to one for the entire JSB dataset, due to a regrettable lack of midi-track information in these files, many of which are actually four-part harmonies; the pieces in the NOT dataset contain either one part (for pure melodies) or two (for melodies with accompanying chord accompaniments); the PMD dataset contains up to six parts (for a three-part Bach fugue, in which left and right hands are followed separately); MUS contains up to 27 parts (for Bach's Matthew Passion); and the CMA datasets contain two pieces with 46 voices - Ravel's Valses Nobles et Sentimentales and Venus, in which left and right hands are followed separately."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Special thanks to Pierre Schwob of http: / / www.classicalarchives.com, who has allowed us to release the data in the form described by us."}], "references": [{"title": "Harmonising Chorales by Probabilistic Inference", "author": ["M.
