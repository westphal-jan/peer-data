Introduction", "text": "Simplified Boardgames is a class of fairytale chess-like games that was first introduced in [1] and slightly expanded in [3] (see [2] for an alternative expansion).The class is designed to learn the rules of the game by watching games.The Simplified Boardgames language describes turn-based zero-sum games involving two players on a rectangular board, with figure movements being a subset of a regular language.Here we offer a formal specification for Simplified Boardgames. Despite the fact that the class was used in several essays, its formal grammar was not yet clearly defined, and some questions remained unclear.Such a definition is crucial for further research into AI competitions, procedural content generation, translations, etc. By way of comparison: Metagame system, which can be considered the predecessor of Simplified Boardgames, its grammar was explicitly explained in [7]."}, {"heading": "2.

The simplified board game version of Gardner. However, the movement rules of the available pieces are explained in the < PIECES > section and generated from the \"pieces\" without a terminal. A piece can have at most one movement rule consisting of the letter of the piece and a regular expression. A piece without the movement rule is allowed but cannot be moved. For a given piece, the set of legal moves is the set of words described by a regular expression using an alphabet containing triplets, where x and each y are relative column / row distances, and on the other piece {e, p} the contents of the target square are described: e shows an empty square, p a square occupied by a separate piece. Let's assume that x. \""}, {"heading": "3. Summary", "text": "In contrast to Metagame, Simplified board games include games with asymmetry and position-dependent moves (e.g. chess beginner's double pawn move).The use of finite automata to describe the figure rules and thus to generate moves enables a quick and efficient calculation of all legal moves in a board setup. The regularity of the description also makes it convenient for e.g. process-based content generation [4, 5].However, it causes some important limitations. Actions such as castling, en-passant or promotions are impossible to express, since all moves depend on the game story. Although the absolute position of a piece is not available, this annoyance can be cleverly circumvented, so that it is possible to describe e.g. chess builders an initial two-square lead."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning Rules of Simplified Boardgames by Observing", "author": ["Y.
