Introduction", "text": "In recent years, the complexity and power of the human brain / mind system has been further revealed by several studies, and a myriad of questions relating to mechanisms and functions have still not been answered. An increasing number of biologically inspired studies and publications have been read in the scientific community, ranging from approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) to outcomes of general interest in information technology (IT). It has been widely acknowledged that emotions play an important role in human life Picard (1997); Arbib and Fellous (2004); Marsella and Gratch (2003). However, traditional AI approaches do not take into account all dynamics and creative aspects of the mind and therefore call for new attacks on the problem of mind modeling. There are several projects worth mentioning in the context of emotions and affection simulation in cognitive architectures: Kansei implements an emotionally oriented approach Nagamachi (2010), Emotions are considered in CogAff and Chrisley Simulatics."}, {"heading": "2. The problem", "text": "It has historically been believed that AI systems can be built on traditional computer architectures for specific purposes, and that with enough computing power and memory resources, plus some good algorithms, a human-like symbolic intelligence was feasible. It was only a matter of time, money and technology after the initial excitement in this regard (mainly in the 50s of the last century) and numerous failures in achieving the desired results, it has lately been hypothesized that this may not be the case. Technically, the neuroendocrine system that provides the mechanisms for brain activity may not be a turing machine, although the functioning is not fully understood at the moment. Specifically, it is not clear whether higher functions performed by humans, such as awareness, epiphenomena of the brain itself or note.Despite this fact, and the acceptance of the fact that we are unable to model the full neuroendocrine system in the von Neumann architecture, can help to develop parallels between the two, and specific relationships between the two."}, {"heading": "3. Our cognitive affective architecture: NEUCOGAR", "text": "In this section we present our novel approach to artificial cognitive architectures, the NEUromodulating COGnitive ARchitecture (NEUCOGAR), the idea being to map monoamine neuromodulators to emotional states applied to computer system parameters. Our work is based on the following considerations: 1. Emotions are natural and necessary modulators simultaneously amplified and modelled by social external factors or even internal thought.3. Several modular models are available: Geneva emotion wheel, Plutchicks \"Wheel of Emotions\" Plutchik (2001) or Cube of Emotion Lovheim (2012). Plutchiks \"Cube of Emotion Lovheim et al."}, {"heading": "3.1. From real emotions to artificial ones", "text": "The idea behind the assignment of neuromodulators to system parameters is to create a link between the Von Neumann architecture (abstractly a Turing Machine) and the neuroendocrine system. Our research makes it possible to implement a biologically inspired architecture based on neuromodulators. As we will show in the next sections, this innovative approach can open up new avenues in the automatic control and development of computer systems, and our goal is to take radically different paths."}, {"heading": "3.2. NEUCOGAR in details", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where there is only one person who is able to take care of another person who is able to take care of another person."}, {"heading": "4. Validation", "text": "To validate our approach, we have implemented dopamine neuromodulation of the fear response in the computer system and are reviewing an axis of our model. In this section, we report on preliminary experiments we have conducted. Specifically, in section 4.1, we describe the setup of the experiment, while in section 4.2, we present the results obtained."}, {"heading": "4.1. Experiment description", "text": "The experiment looks for the validation of dopamine neuromodulation and its influence on a cerebral cortex and thus on thought processes. We generally assumed that thought processes operate analogously to, or could be expressed as such, computer processes. We implemented a nigrostriatal dopamine pathway published by Albin et al. (1989), which is equipped with some extensions for feedback loops and additional connections according to modern neuroscientific findings, as in Fig. 2. Dopamine neuromodulation is modulated by an area of the brain called substantia nigra compacta (SNc), which produces dopamine and projects it onto another area of the brain called striatum to balance between the pathways. The mammalian striatum consists of neurons with different dopamine receptors: D1 and D2 balance direct and indirect (in Fig.) cerbit ultivative pathways (in the Followed Coratum \u2192 is stimulated by a teebit)."}, {"heading": "4.2. Results", "text": "In our simulation with the spiking tool NEST for neural networks, we wanted to show these mechanisms, with particular emphasis on the neuromodulation of dopamine. In particular, we observed during the experiments the spiking activities of the thalamus and the motor cerebrum, which responded to this nerve modulation. We therefore created a spiking network model of the entire nigrostriatal signaling pathway, which simulated its behavior in the simulation timeframe of 0.1000 ms. At 400 ms, we triggered a volume transmission of dopamine in substancia nigra and observed the effects in both the thalamus and the motor cerebrum. Figure 3 describes the reaction of the thalamus. It shows the increasing spiking activities immediately after the input of substancia nigra, highlighting a growing activity on computing power and increasing its utilization. As a side effect, this reinforced the synapses among neurons, thereby increasing the persistence of the data."}, {"heading": "5.
