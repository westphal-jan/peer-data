INTRODUCTION", "text": "A significant amount of research in the disciplines of Music Content Analysis and Content-based Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has been plagued by the inability to distinguish between solutions and \"horses\" [Gouyon et al. 2013; Urbano et al. 2013; Sturm 2014a; 2014b]. In its most basic form, a \"horse\" is a system that looks as if it is solving a particular problem when in fact it is not [Sturm 2014a]. This was exactly the case with Clever Hans [Pfungst 1911], a real horse that was claimed to be able to do arithmetic and other features of abstract thinking. Clever Hans appeared to answer complex questions that were asked of him, but he had actually learned to respond to the involuntary cue of his many inquisitors who were faced with scanning the correct number of times. The \"tricks\" circumvented the discovery for a few reasons: 1) which cue was almost undetectable."}, {"heading": "2. THE PROBLEM OF MUSIC CONTENT ANALYSIS", "text": "(...) (...) (...) (...) (...)

Conclusion", "text": "We know that DeSPerF-based systems are sensitive to temporal events that repeat themselves within a specific frequency range and time window, which limits what DeSPerF-BALLROOM can use to generate the FoM in Fig. 1. For example, due to its lack of spectral resolution, it cannot use melodies or harmonies to detect elements of UV, A. As it marginalizes the quefrency information, it cannot be differentiated based on instrumentation. It seems that the only knowledge a DeSPerF-based system can use must be temporally within a 10-second window. Before we can go any further, we need to develop an understanding of how DeSPerF-BALLROOM has been trained and tested, and therefore what Fig. 1 could mean. In the next section, we will analyze the teaching and test materials used to produce DeSPerF-BALLROOM, and its FoM in Fig. 1."}, {"heading": "4. THE MATERIALS OF TEACHING AND TESTING", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "4.3. Conclusion", "text": "Although the explicit and intended purpose of BALLROOM is to detect and distinguish rhythmic patterns, we see that there are indeed many other tasks a system could perform in reproducing the basic truth. Indeed, the usual experimental approach to music content analysis used to produce the FoM in Fig. 1 has no ability to distinguish between them. Just as in the case of Clever Hans's demonstrations, if a music content analysis system were to detect indeed characteristic rhythms of some BALLROOM labels, its FoM might pale in comparison to a system that has no idea of rhythm at all (Fig. 9). Fig. 1 provides no evidence for claims that DeSPerF-BALLROOM identifies the waltz by recognizing its characteristic rhythmic patterns, tempo, instrumentation and / or any other factor."}, {"heading": "5. SEEKING THE \u201cHORSE\u201d INSIDE THE MUSIC CONTENT ANALYSIS SYSTEM", "text": "It is obvious that DeSPerF-BALLROOM knows something about the recordings in BALLROOM; otherwise, its FoM in Fig. 1 would not be so significantly different from chance. As described in the previous section, this could be because the system performs a series of tasks, whether by detecting rhythms, detecting tempo, or using statistics with completely opaque relationships to the music content. In this section, we will describe several experiments to explain Fig. 1."}, {"heading": "5.1.

Experiment 3: System output dependence on the rate of onsets and periodic stresses", "text": "In this experiment, we observe how the behavior of the system changes when the input exhibits repetitive structures that include a period that includes multiple intrusions. We perform this experiment in the same way as the previous one. We synthesize each recording in the same way, but stress every second, third, or fourth repetition of the white noise eruption. We generate stress in two ways. In the first case, each stressed eruption has an amplitude that is four times higher than that of an unstressed intrusion. In the second case, all unstressed intrusions are generated by a high-pass filtering of the white noise eruption (pass band frequency 1 kHz). We generate a total of 200 recordings for each of the stress periods, and each type of stress, with break rates logarithmic between 50 and 260 intrusions per minute. Finally, we record the system output for each recording (pass band frequency 1 kHz)."}, {"heading": "5.4.
