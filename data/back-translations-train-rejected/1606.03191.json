INTRODUCTION", "text": "The analysis of development gaps in development economics is essentially using classes typology theory by comparing the level of GRDP for the current year with that of the previous year, both in terms of the total GRDP and GRDPforming sector itself. Classes typology theory divides the level of development into four quadrants according to the rules of each based on the comparison of the average growth rate and the average contribution of each development sector to obtain specific quadrants of development (as shown in Table 1 for more details). This study intends to conduct discussions to generate a new approach to analyzing the inequality of development of an area combined with the concept of fuzzy system with classes typology. The expected result is of course able to provide a new approach to analyzing development differences from the perspective of information technology. Both methods have advantages in accordance with the position of each concept. Classes typology widely used by scientists to determine the quadrant of development."}, {"heading": "2.

Basically, each hazy system will apply a different principle of each other, applying a combination of rules, both the pure hazy systems and the TSK hazy system with haziness and debuzzyfication. The main problems facing the pure hazardous systems are that the input and output of hazardous systems (in the form of natural language) can be either real values of a variable, while in engineering science the input and output of real values of a variable.

The value of the GRDP is calculated according to two approaches. The first approach is a direct calculation based on data-relevant areas related to the products and services produced. The second approach is based on an indirect calculation by adding economic value and national value-added to the group of economic activity concerned. The results of the calculation and are then presented in the form of the calculation of the GRDP at current prices and constant prices. In this study, the GRDP is used at current prices as data to be analyzed."}, {"heading": "3.

Similarly, the earlier stages of fuzzy systems, RD and RC values for the province are calculated to obtain the following results (as shown in Table 4).The next step is the comparison of the value of fuzzy systems and RC values for the province. In this step, the class rules shown in Table 1 are used to compare the value of RD and RC between districts / cities in the province. Classification according to the Development Gap GDP Indicator as follows (see Table 5): Based on Table 5, it can be seen that the agricultural sector (V1) of Kota Cilegon lies in Quadrant I (K1), which sectors have developed and grown in leaps and bounds."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "The test results in Kota Cilegon showed that the model is generally able to analyze the inequality sector GRDP of a region. However, this model requires further studies in connection with the fuzzy rule used in the process of steps 2 and 3 of the developed model. Results between fuzzy classes and the traditional class typology showed a highly significant difference. In the model developed, which is dominated by the inequality quadrant I (K1), while the traditional typology classes shows the quadrant diverse but dominated by quadrant IV (K4), the cause of this difference may be less precise by adopting rules of the classes, so that the resulting fuzzy rule is still not quite correct. Subsequent studies can develop models by combining decision structures to extract rules from data classification using national data."}, {"heading": "7.
