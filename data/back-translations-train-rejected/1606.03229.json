As a result, the behavior exhibited is that of modular systems, each responsible for specific functional domains.The development of cognitive science has recently shown that living beings actually integrate multiple functionalities that work in parallel and the emergence of higher functions such as consciousness may not be possible without the complex cooperation of such subsystems.In this paper, we present a three-dimensional model that provides a computational framework for an ecosystem of cognitive units, which is then extended to computer systems and then extended to specific IT domains such as robotics, services, or networks.The model must be viewed as a multivisionary representation of phenomena such as artificial consciousness, artificial creativity, and artificial intuition. Any view can best be illustrated by an analogy with known anthropocentric domains: physiology, psychology, philosophy (P), artificial creativity, and artificial intuition."}, {"heading": "2 The P 3 anthropocentric model", "text": "The human brain follows a non-centralized subsumption architecture, in which consciousness is a very important but non-determining level of administration; it must operate outside our complete control in dynamic environments; it explains why people who face similar environmental conditions react differently according to their inner states, memories, or necessities; this can be justified by the fact that the topology of cognition is distributed throughout the body, the cultural realm, and the brain. To date, attempts by artificial intelligence to reproduce or imitate complex behaviors have failed, as similar adaptive and multi-layered systems are achieved; our goal is to develop more efficient, problem-solving, and innovative AI systems that offer a new architectural design; we see three areas as the real modules of a truly intelligent system that produces complex behaviors, reasoning, and belongs to a consistency, as shown in Figure 1, Bottom up: Physiology, Psychology, and Philosophy-3, which we view as the starting point for a new approach to the P in these areas."}, {"heading": "2.1 The Layers", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "2.2 Integrating domains", "text": "In this body, several mechanisms are based on internal and external data sets, which must be analyzed in real time in order to elicit adequate responses if the organism that wants to survive and fulfill its intentional needs (saving energy, acquiring energy, communicating data - as reproduction or cultural transmission -, maintaining the system - playing, practicing, etc.).This internal process of data management is managed by the brain, at the level of psychology, fully modelled and controlled by emotional mechanisms that allow the evaluation of the acquired data and its application during the decision-making processes."}, {"heading": "2.3 Abstraction", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive themselves are not able to survive themselves, \"he said in an interview with the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.\" I don't think I'm able to survive myself, \"he told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, adding,\" I don't think I'm going to be able to survive myself. \"He added,\" I don't think I'm going to be able to survive myself. \"He added,\" I don't think I'm going to be able to survive myself. \"He added,\" I don't think I'm able to survive myself. \""}, {"heading": "3 A P 3 Computing System Model", "text": "Based on the anthropocentric P 3 model of Fig. 1 in this section, we map the three layers identified there into the corresponding layer for an abstract computer system. In our view, a computer system is a physical and / or abstract system, such as computer machines, devices, robots, networks, distributed systems, software, services, algorithms, workflows, data, in computer science and engineering. In this way, Fig. 2 specifies a new paradigmatic approach to computing, identifying three layers: MetaComputing, MindComputing, PhysioComputing. These layers interact with each other and implement functionalities of the corresponding P 3 model layers, i.e. physiology, psychology and philosophy, with relationships, interactions and basic mechanisms of the previous model remaining specialized only in computer systems."}, {"heading": "3.1 PhysioComputing", "text": "PhysioComputing implements the physiology of computing. It is therefore usually connected to the hardware and low-level software, such as firmware, and provides the basic functionality for the proper functioning of a computing system. From an abstract point of view, PhysioComputing provides the basic mechanisms that implement the most important functionality for the functioning of a computing system. The scope of PhysioComputing includes structural, functional, organisational and communicative aspects of computing systems."}, {"heading": "3.2 MindComputing", "text": "MindComputing is the psychology of computing. It should take into account the details of phenomena at a high level, taking into account broader and more conceptual approaches to artificial intelligence based on the concepts, mechanisms and functionalities introduced and provided at a lower level by PhysioComputing. From the perspective of abstract computer systems, PhysioComputing implements advanced and improved mechanisms, strategies and strategies for local optimization of the system, with the system only being considered introspectively. Scope of MindComputing therefore consists in implementing improved services or systems in addition to the basic mechanisms, processes and functionalities of the lower level."}, {"heading": "3.3 MetaComputing", "text": "MetaComputing is the philosophy of computing. Based on the concepts, mechanisms and policies of MindComputing and PhysioComputing, it offers a further abstraction from a more general point of view, i.e. taking into account the interaction of the entire computing system with the environment from the outside. This is a meta-level where the computing system is considered as part of the environment and its interactions with the other systems or elements are taken into account. The scope of MetaComputing includes definitions and high-level meta views of the problems, thus providing meta solutions that are enforced as policies and mechanisms at lower MindComputing and PhysioComputing levels."}, {"heading": "4 Applications", "text": "In order to bring the narrative to a more practical perspective, we offer some examples of possible applications of the framework P 3 described above. We describe areas of social networks and cognitive robotics that are represented in the three level perspectives of philosophy, psychology and physiology. This three-focal view of the complex phenomena could be useful in several areas that will be demonstrated below."}, {"heading": "4.1 Social Network", "text": "One of the most important applications of the concepts described so far takes place in the field of social networks. Internet and Web form a global artificial organism / ecosystem on which actual life can be built in the broadest sense. At the level of physiology (PhysioComputing), this organism (node of the network) represents the basic \"building block\" of the living ecosystem that can be built on it. Applications such as Facebook allow users to create profiles and self-identification in living organisms. Facebook profiles at the psychological level (MindComputing) represent precisely the subjective self-characterization of users in relation to other people who populate the network. The metaphor also applies at the philosophical level (MetaComputing), where meta-analysis of the activities of the organism is carried out. Here, for example, the analysis of big data or opinion polls is located. The system has the peculiar ability to think about itself at this level, and this can be evaluated by users themselves [5]."}, {"heading": "4.2 Cognitive robotics", "text": "Another application of MetaComputing, MindComputing and PhysioComputing to the cognitive field of robotics gives rise to three new areas: MetaBotics, MindBotics, HardBotics. Where in HardBotics we were able to identify the following concepts: artificial living systems that are able to regenerate through universal living \"bricks / cells.\" Neural systems in particular might be able to reshape their connections / \"synapses\" and the generation of new neurons through \"artificial neurogenesis.\" MindBotics contains definitions of multiple phenomena: affects, high-level emotions, temperament, psychotypes, consciousness, etc. In turn, a robotics system could fit into Marvin Minsky's philosophical \"Model of 6\" [6] by utilizing emerging effects of living \"artificial bricks / cells\" such as pattern adaptations, predictions, associative learning, reflections, self-awareness, etc., to extend their systems reflection, etc."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Works", "text": "Viruses (which are still under discussion as to whether they belong to the realm of living beings) also have basic objectives in the fields of nutrition and reproduction; once these systems have acquired tools to process larger data arrays, they can generate more complex patterns of interaction, a basis well understood by neurobiologists but difficult to translate into current AI applications. - The approach presented in this paper aims to create a more coherent framework for agent design that identifies three closely related areas even though they operate at different functional levels. - The basis of artificial life lies in the idea of physiocomputing. - Self-emerging characters based on the self-organization of connections and signals processed by living cells (neurons) are the main goal of MindComputing. Consciousness, for example, is interpreted as a self-emerging property of neural networks. - From a functional perspective, consciousness is the result of data multiintegration, but the feeling of creating a conscious level of processing is based on elaborate work."}], "references": [{"title": "Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology", "author": ["J.
