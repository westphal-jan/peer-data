Most techniques have been developed after an intensive experimental process, and it is thought that these techniques exploit the underlying structure of industrial cases. However, there have been few recent attempts to accurately characterize the structure of industrial SAT cases with respect to complex networks. The research community of complex networks has developed analysis techniques and algorithms to study real diagrams that can be used by the SAT community. In this paper, inspired by the results of complex networks, we examine the community structure or modularity of industrial SAT cases. In a diagram with a clear community structure or high modularity, we can find a division of their nodes into communities, so that most of the edges of the same community connect variables."}, {"heading": "1.

Related Work", "text": "The previous version of this paper [4] was a groundbreaking contribution to many other work. The community structure correlates with the runtime of CDCL SAT solvers [33, 34] and was also used to improve the performance of multiple solvers. Martins et al. [29] Partition MaxSAT instances that use the community structure to identify minor unsatisfactory subformulas. This method is used by Neves et al. [30]. Sonobe et al. [40] use the partition obtained with the community structure to improve the performance of a parallel SAT solver. The community structure is used to identify relevant erudite clauses, and the performance of multiple CDCL SAT solvers is improved by the original instance containing this set of useful clauses [5]. An important problem for developing new SAT solution techniques specializing in industrial problems is the limited number of these benchmarks and the high cost of solving them."}, {"heading": "3.

In the case of SAT instances, we have shown that this model is suitable for studying random formulas.

have experienced a remarkable progress on solving industrial instances. Most of the techniques have been developed after an intensive experimental process. It is believed that these techniques exploit the underlying structure of industrial instances. However, there are few works trying to exactly characterize the main features of this structure. The research community on complex networks has developed techniques of analysis and algorithms to study real-world graphs that can be used by the SAT community. Recently, there have been some attempts to analyze the structure of industrial SAT instances in terms of complex networks, with the aim of explaining the success of SAT solving techniques, and possibly improving them. In this paper, inspired by the results on complex networks, we study the community structure, or modularity, of industrial SAT instances. In a graph with clear community structure, or high modularity, we can find a partition of its nodes into communities such that most edges connect variables of the same community. In our analysis, we represent SAT instances as graphs, and we show that most application benchmarks are characterized by a high modularity. On the contrary, random SAT instances are closer to the classical Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi random graph model, where no structure can be observed. We also analyze how this structure evolves by the effects of the execution of the SAT solver. We detect that new clauses learnt by the solver during the search contribute to destroy the original community structure of the formula. This partially explains the distinct performance of SAT solvers on random and industrial SAT instances.", "creator": "gnuplot 5.0 patchlevel 0"}}}
