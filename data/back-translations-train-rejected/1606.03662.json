Traditional methods include offline manual survey, which is very time consuming, and analytic models based on census data, which are un- able to adapt to the dynamic market. The rapid increase of the availability of big data from various types of mobile devices, such as online query data and offline positioning data, provides us with the possibility to develop automatic and accurate data-driven prediction models for business store placement. In this paper, we propose a Demand Distribution Driven Store Placement (D3SP) framework for business store placement by mining search query data from Baidu Maps. D3SP first detects the spatial-temporal distributions of customer demands on different business services via query data from Baidu Maps, the largest online map search engine in China, and detects the gaps between demand and sup- ply. Then we determine candidate locations via clustering such gaps. In the final stage, we solve the location optimization problem by predicting and ranking the number of customers. We not only deploy supervised regression models to predict the number of customers, but also learn to rank models to directly rank the locations. We evaluate our framework on various types of businesses in real-world cases, and the experiments results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. D3SP as the core function for store placement has already been implemented as a core component of our business analytics platform and could be potentially used by chain store merchants on Baidu Nuomi.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 Jun 2016 03:42:10 GMT  (3641kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03662v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["mengwen xu", "tianyi wang", "zhengwei wu", "jingbo zhou", "jian li", "haishan wu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03662"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.03662.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Store Location Selection via Mining Search Query Logs of Baidu Maps", "authors": ["Mengwen Xu", "Tianyi Wang", "Zhengwei Wu", "Jingbo Zhou", "Jian Li", "Haishan Wu"], "emails": ["xumengwen@baidu.com", "wangtianyi02@baidu.com", "wuzhengwei@baidu.com", "zhoujingbo@baidu.com", "wuhaishan@baidu.com", "lijian83@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Tags Business; Store Placement; Multi-Source Data; Machine Learning"}, {"heading": "1.

In this paper, we aim to first identify a few candidate locations by identifying demand centers, and then classify them by predicting the custom number that each location can have. Figure 2 shows the overall frame of our paper, and further details are as follows. In a city, there may be many locations that can be selected to open a store. Our first step is to find multiple demand centers Ld = {l1, l2,..., lm} as candidate locations for a store category C or a specific brand of chain stores B. Map query data is used to find the demand points where users query a POI or POI of the same category. Thus, we get the demand centers Ld = 1 store location, then we transform the problem of a specific store location into a store location, or a specific problem of a store location."}, {"heading": "3. OBTAINING DEMAND CENTERS", "text": "Our work is inspired by the fact that map queries reflect the targeted demand of users. Each query contains a source location and a destination. The source location has demand, while the destinations can meet demand. An ideal place to open a new business is where there is a lot of demand but little supply. In this section, we try to identify such places with the knowledge of map query data. We start by analyzing user demand and then suggest methods to identify the demand centers."}, {"heading": "3.1 User Demand Analysis", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to decide for themselves what they want, and they are able to decide whether they want to or not."}, {"heading": "3.2 Finding Demand centers", "text": "To find demand centers, we have three steps: Identification of need points, without supply and clustering of need points. Identify need points. In the first step, we will identify and characterize demand, e.g. Starbucks. As we have already explained, we extract timestamps and locations from each query, including specific requests with targeted keywords Starbucks or general requests with categories or tags of coffee from \"nearby\" queries. We then characterize the temporal and spatial characteristics of need points. After we have identified the geographical distribution of need points, we must identify the gap between demand and supply. For specific requirements, we directly exclude areas where an offer already exists. Here, the exclusion is based on distance characteristics. From the distribution of source and target distance, we identify a threshold of 80%, i.e. 80% of users will not get to a store that is further away from the corresponding distance."}, {"heading": "4. RANKING PROMISING LOCATIONS", "text": "In the demand centers, we rank these promising locations next. In this work, we use monitored machine learning models to evaluate the locations. There are two directions. First, we can directly apply learn-to-rank methods. Second, we can predict the number of customers using regression models and then evaluate them based on the predicted customer numbers. We look at both in our work as shown in Section 4.1. Then, we will present the functions we use in our models."}, {"heading": "4.1 Ranking Algorithms", "text": "Considering a list of demand centers Lm, we use the monitored learning methods to rank or predict the number of consumers of a new business in Lm | The places with higher values are the optimal places. The starting method is to randomly classify Lm, and the places ranked at the top are the results.Learning To Rank Challenge. We first apply directly to rank methods. The method we use in this paper is LambdaMART [4], which is a widely used trick to rank method in many works and the winner of the 2010 Yahoo! Learning To Rank Challenge. It is a combination of increased tree MART and a learn to rank methods LambdaRank.Regression. For the regression method we consider linear regression with regulation (lasso) and the kernel methods, including support vector regression (SVR) [10] and kernel regression (kression)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Features", "text": "In this part, we will introduce the characteristics extracted from the multi-source data, which reflect the quality of the area for the new store, including functionality, transportation options, competition, economic development, etc. If you specify a location l and category C of the new store to be opened, the characteristics Fl can be extracted from the integrative dataset indexed in the geographical POI index. Remember that the area is centered around l a disk with a radius of r (1 km). Distance from the center of the city. The popularity of a store depends not only on local information about the location, but also on its geographical location in a city. To see how customers allocate for one type of store in a city, we draw the thermal image maps of consumer behavior for explicit inns and coffee shops in Beijing, respectively, in Figure 8."}, {"heading": "5. EVALUATION", "text": "Given a POI category or brand, we first evaluate the performance of our prediction method against existing POIs of the same category or brand.

The ranking of the places based on the actual popularity (number of customers) of these POIs is also obtained from the POI customer data set. The position of the location li in LR is marked with rank (li). To evaluate the ranking performance of our result, we use the nDCG @ k (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) metric [12] and the nSD @ k (Normalized Symmetric Difference) metric proposed in [16]."}, {"heading": "5.2 Evaluation data and algorithms", "text": "We use two categories of shops, which are Express Inns and Coffee Shops, to evaluate the performance of our system."}, {"heading": "5.3 Feature importance", "text": "Before we show the results of the prediction algorithms, we use Random Forests with the impurity of Gini to determine the meaning of the characteristics for the two categories of POIs, which is represented in 10. The characteristics from top to bottom are the price of real estate in the vicinity, the popularity of the area, the number of POIs, the competition, the transportation, the distance to the city center and the category of an area. The meaning of the characteristics of coffee shops and express inns is quite different. For coffee shops, the most important characteristics are the popularity of the area, the competition and the distance to the center. However, real estate prices, competition and transportation are the key characteristics for express inns. This is noteworthy: the real estate price can affect the price of express inns. When tourists opt for a hotel, they tend to choose the cheap and convenient. Coffeeshops usually attract people in the vicinity. Competition exists everywhere and is important for all kinds of POIs that we can recognize the importance of experimenting with the results of the category."}, {"heading": "5.4 General demands accuracy", "text": "In this section we evaluate the accuracy in the situation of general demand, and the categories are the coffee shops and fast food restaurants. We first evaluate the test categories in Beijing using the above two metrics with different learning methods. The evaluation results in Table 3 show that our results with the Learning-to-Rank algorithm and the ensembled methods are far better than the result of the random baseline method. The accuracy of the results with the nDCG @ 10 shows that the performance of the algorithms we have trained is higher than the accuracy of the results. Table 3 shows the accuracy of the results that are evaluated with the nDCG @ 10. We measure the performance of the algorithms based on the features we have trained."}, {"heading": "5.5 Specific demands accuracy", "text": "In contrast to general requirements, for specific requirements we evaluate two brands of coffee shops and fast food restaurants of the chain, namely \"Starbucks\" and \"Home Inn,\" using nDCG @ 5 and nSD @ 5. We randomly select 20% of the data and remain as training data. Table 2 shows the average results of the ten repeated experiments. Comparing them with the initial value of 0.510, Random Forests is the optimal learning algorithm for \"Starbucks\" with nDCG @ 5 = 0.740, which provides an improvement of about 45%. For \"HomeInn,\" the optimal learning algorithm is LambdaMART with nDCG @ 5 = 0.748. Even the lowest nSD @ 5 are 0.56 and 0.65 for \"Starbucks\" and \"Home Inn,\" respectively. The above results show that our framework also works well in the branches."}, {"heading": "5.6 Real cases", "text": "Now we are examining two real cases that may somehow reflect the effectiveness of our framework (both the requirement part and the learning part): The two cases are \"Starbucks,\" which opened in January 2016, and the hotpot restaurant \"HaiDiLao,\" which opened in September 2015. We get the location with the requirements based on the map query data from April 2015 to June 2015, which is far from the existence of two new stores. The locations with the requirements of \"Starbucks\" and \"HaiDiLao\" are shown in Figure 11 (a) and Figure 11 (b), respectively. Note that we exclude the existing stores open at that time. We train the random forests model using the two brands of existing chain stores. The ranking of locations with the requirements of \"HaiDiLao\" is [\"4,\" \"1,\" \"9,\" \"\" 2, \"\" \"6,\" \"\" 12, \"5,\" \"\" \"\" 8, \"\" \"\" \"\" 10, \"\" \"\" list 3, \"and\" the \"list is located between the\" Top 5, \"the\" in the \"Location."}, {"heading": "6. RELATED WORK", "text": "Researchers have focused on various techniques, including spatial interaction models, multiple regression discriminant analysis, and so on. [11] Spatial interaction models are based on the assumption that the intensity of interaction between two sites decreases with distance, and that the usability of a site increases with the intensity of use and proximity of compatibly arranged sites [1, 2, 25, 15]. Specifically, the work in [15] deals with spatial interaction theory, customer density estimates, and miniMax decision criterion to address site selection issues. The authors of [2, 25] use theoretical models of optimal locations by maximizing the number of residents it attracts in Euclidean space or road network. By saying that a site attracts a resident, we mean that the location is closest to the location where the resident lives among all existing businesses."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this article, we propose a novel framework D3SP for the problem of optimal store placement. Our framework combines the spatial distribution of user requirements with the popularity and economic characteristics of each location. Also, the integration of multiple data sources allows us to extract rich features from existing stores. The evaluation results show the effectiveness of our proposed method for optimal store placement both in experiments and in real business scenarios."}, {"heading": "8. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] A.

Traditional methods include offline manual survey, which is very time consuming, and analytic models based on census data, which are unable to adapt to the dynamic market. The rapid increase of the availability of big data from various types of mobile devices, such as online query data and offline positioning data, provides us with the possibility to develop automatic and accurate data-driven prediction models for business store placement. In this paper, we propose a Demand Distribution Driven Store Placement (D3SP) framework for business store placement by mining search query data from Baidu Maps. D3SP first detects the spatial-temporal distributions of customer demands on different business services via query data from Baidu Maps, the largest online map search engine in China, and detects the gaps between demand and supply. Then we determine candidate locations via clustering such gaps. In the final stage, we solve the location optimization problem by predicting and ranking the number of customers. We not only deploy supervised regression models to predict the number of customers, but also learn to rank models to directly rank the locations. We evaluate our framework on various types of businesses in real-world cases, and the experiments results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. D3SP as the core function for store placement has already been implemented as a core component of our business analytics platform and could be potentially used by chain store merchants on Baidu Nuomi.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
