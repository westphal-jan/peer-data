MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING AND AED", "text": "In supervised learning labels for all instances are known during the training and the learner tries to find decision boundaries that can best separate these designated instances. As we are involved in detecting the presence or absence of an event in a record, we will basically deal with binary cases where labels are either \u2212 1 or 1. Instances that belong to the target class are described as positive (+ 1 label) and those that do not belong to the target class as negative (-1). Multiple learning can be described as a generalised form of supervised learning. Here, labels are not known for every instance, instead labels for a bag full of instances are known. A bag is described as positive if at least one instance in it is labelled as negative. This implies that all instances in a negative bag can be labelled as negative."}, {"heading": "2.1. Audio Feature Representation", "text": "The first step is the parameterization of all audio recordings by basic features such as Mel Cepstra coefficients (MFCC); the MFCC characteristics for all available audio are then used to learn a code book through clustering algorithms (e.g. Kmeans); then, for each given recording, their MFCC vectors are quantified to a cluster in the code book; and finally, a histogram is used that represents the number of MFCC vectors that belong to each cluster as a feature representation for recording. We need a form of feature representation that can represent robust short-term audio segments (instances of pockets). [19] showed that it is better to use the number of MFCC vectors that are used to detect events using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)."}, {"heading": "3. MIL ALGORITHMS", "text": "The first two algorithms, referred to as miSVM and MISVM [20], are based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The standard SVM algorithm was modified to work in the MIL domain. Although a few other SVM formulations for the MIL domain were proposed [18], miSVM and MISVM were the first SVM formulations for MIL and were well suited for a variety of MIL tasks. Our third MIL algorithm is a more general approach called miFV, which attempts to solve the scalability problem in the MIL paradigm. Our proposed novel MIL method is also based on the idea behind the MIL. We offer a brief description of these methods."}, {"heading": "3.1. miSVM and MISVM", "text": "miSVM is the first method to be used in this area. [20] To ensure a positive constellation, all positive bags are initialized in positive bags with positive bags. [20] miSVM is the first method to be used in positive bags. [20] miSVM is an instance in which the labels for positive bags are positively processed. [20] This formulation is used in an iterative manner. [20] It results in mixed-integer programming in which the labels of the instance and the separation levels of the hyperplanes are shared. An optimization of heuristics is used to solve it in an iterative manner. First, standard SVM is solved with the current assigned labels for positive bags."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "text": "We used TRECVID-MED 2011 database, which is then tested on the fourth set. We do all this in different ways. We used TRECVID-MED 2011 database [26] to evaluate different MIL algorithms. It seems as if all FV algorithms are superior. Weak labels are obtained for 8 acoustic events on a subset of the database. Binary classifiers are taught to detect the presence or absence of each of these events. The total number of positive pockets for each event in the datasets is as follows: Cheering-171, Children Voices - 33, Clapping - 102, Crowd - 142, Drums - 25, Engine Noise- 80, Laughing - 30 Please note that one bag can be positive for several events and it may be considered negative for all 8 events. Datasets are divided into 4 sets."}, {"heading": "5. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This paper dealt with scalability issues in the detection of audio events. We addressed scalability issues on two fronts. Firstly, this work is directly related to the detection of audio events where acquiring heavily labeled data is extremely difficult and expensive, which imposes limitations on the vocabulary of audio events and the amount of training data available for audio events. The aim of this work was to provide a way to address these scaling problems. Our claim is that obtaining weak labels is much easier than obtaining strong labels. We then successfully demonstrated that multiple instance learning frames can be used to learn from weakly labeled data. Secondly, the scalability of the MIL algorithm even for AED tasks. Standard MIL algorithms such as miSVM and MISVM can be used to detect thousands of instances of scalability problems themselves, because the number of data instances can be multiplied by thousands."}, {"heading": "6.
