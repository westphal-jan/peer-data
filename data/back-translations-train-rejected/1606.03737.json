Data about Public Transport", "text": "The data relate to March 2015 and include the following: bus stops; terminals; bus GPS; and ticket validation. Bus stops are places where passengers enter and exit. In total, this data set has 4783 geo-referenced data sets. Bus lines have 359 data sets that contain information about the direction of the route and its itinerary. Bus stops, the smallest of the data sets, as they have only seven data sets, are a place designed to provide a better service in user conversion, different bus routes pass through terminals. The Bus GPS data set has around 104 million data sets. Buses register their location every thirty seconds. In a total of 2034 buses operating in Fortaleza in March 2015, the data from the bus in Fortaleza is validated."}, {"heading": "B. Generating the Origin-Destination Matrix", "text": "The problem we faced was that we did not say exactly where the passenger got on the bus, because they include the time in which a particular user validated his ticket at the bus stop. However, this geographical coordination is not necessarily the origin of the passenger, since he / she may not have obtained the validity of the ticket at the bus stop. He / she may, for example, have stayed at the back of the vehicle in which the bus is approaching its destination. This problem can be minimized, as we have explained in more detail. Unfortunately, with regard to the user's destination, there is no accurate record indicating where the passenger got off."}, {"heading": "C. Statistical validation of the representativeness of the OD sample spatial", "text": "It is expected that the samples will guarantee with some degree of reliability that the estimated ODs are correct. A major challenge is to ensure that the sample is not spatially distorted, for example that the embarkations on the bus used in the estimates are not proportional (taking into account the bus stop).To validate the sample spatially, we have reviewed the correlation between the embarkations used to estimate the embarkations to the bus stops in Fortaleza."}, {"heading": "A. Supply Transport Network", "text": "The transport infrastructure network of a city's buses is decisive for the movement of people who use the same routes to reach their desired places for daily activities. In the specific case of the bus network, the nodes are stops, and the bus lines that lead people between these stops are the edges. The timetable of a route is the number of stops visited during a route. It is said that a route terminates its timetable when the bus reaches its last stop.We can therefore model a network as a directional graph, G (V, E), with links, V (B) representing the stops and edges, e (E), the supply between two stops. Formally, the weight of the edge represents the weight of the edge,"}, {"heading": "B. Demmand Transport Network from the passenger route", "text": "The simplest case of a route change is when the passenger gets from the point of departure to the expected destination. The first problem in this situation is to identify this other line. It is trivial for cases where the connection with the passage of the map was registered on another bus, which indicates that it is a continuation of the route. The problem is that the connections are sometimes made at the terminals where it is not necessary to re-validate the map. Passengers who make connections at the terminals get on the bus from the entrance door and no longer need maps. It is then necessary to estimate in which terminal this connection was established."}, {"heading": "C.
