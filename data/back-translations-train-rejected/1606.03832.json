Label propagation", "text": "Let G (V, E) be an undirected network, V is the set of N nodes, E is the set of edges. Each node v (v, V) has a label cv. Use Nv to denote the set of neighbors of the node v. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) uses the network structure alone to guide its process, starting with an initial configuration where each node has a unique label. Then, at each step, a node (in asynchronous version) or each node (in synchronous version) can update its current label to the label shared by the maximum number of neighbors. For the node v, its new label can be updated with j = arg max l {| u: cu = l, u = Nv |}, (7) where | X | is the cardinality of the set X, and Nv is the set of nodes v the neighbors of the node of the node label, so that each neighbor of the node label is randomly selected to form a new neighbor, if there are multiple neighbors."}, {"heading": "III. APPROACH", "text": "Inspired by LPA and EK-NNclus, we propose here the ELP algorithm for detecting communities. After an introduction of the concept of node influence, the entire ELP algorithm is presented in detail. Let's look at the network G (V, E), let's let the degree of the node be i di, and A = (aij) N \u00b7 N stands for the adjacence matrix, where aij = 1 indicates that there is a direct edge between the nodes i and j."}, {"heading": "A. The influence of nodes", "text": "Definition 1.

The value \u03c1i describes the meaning of the node i to some extent. The nodes that play a central role in the network have relatively high local densities. Definition 2. Definition: The influence of the node v on its adjacent node u is adjustable and can be set to 1 by default. Many similarity measures can be assumed here. In this essay, the simple Jaccard index is assumed: sim (u, v) denotes the similarity between node u and parameter \u03b7 is adjustable and can be set to 1 by default."}, {"heading": "B. Evidential label propagation", "text": "In this case, the importance of each node in the neighborhood should be considered equivalent in the updating process, not vice versa. That is, the labeling of an important node that can play a central role in the network should be more likely to be maintained in the updating process. Here, we assume that community centers are surrounded by neighbors with lower local densities and that they have a relatively low resemblance to other communities. Then, the labeling of an important node that can play a central role in the network can be used."}, {"heading": "C. Update order", "text": "In ELP, the labels of the nodes are updated in a random order \u03c3. Therefore, we can recognize different communities with different arrangements of the nodes (i.e., different egos), which leads to a stability problem. Like LPA, ELP updates the labels of the nodes asynchronously. Starting from the asynchronous strategy, nodes that update the labels earlier with stable labels will have a positive effect on the later updated ones [20]. To find a good update order, we first introduce the concept of influence variance asVi = influence variance asVi = influence variance on local labeling. (1) To find the absolute value of the labeling (x), we first introduce the concept of influence variance asVi = influence variance on local labeling. (2) We call labeling the absolute value of labeling (x)."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this section, several experiments are performed on graphs. Results are compared with LPA and EKNNclus. It should be noted that EK-Nclus are each used for relational datasets with given differences. (25) We can apply the normalized mutual information to graph datasets to evaluate the quality of the captured communities. NMI of two partitions A and B of the graph, NMI (A, B), can be calculated.

CONCLUSION", "text": "The proposed approach is based on the conventional LPA and the cluster algorithm EK-NNclus. By introducing the node influence, a new strategy for evidence mark propagation is developed. After the propagation process, the domain name of each node is determined on the basis of its plausibility. Experimental results illustrate the advantages of the ELP. It can be used to simultaneously detect the overlapping nodes and outliers. To define the influence of each node, different similarity measures can be assumed. In particular, if there are some attributes describing the characteristics of the nodes, a similarity index is a better choice taking into account both the topological graph structure and the attribute information. Therefore, we intend to discuss the effects of different similarity measures on ELP and the application of ELP on graphs with attribute information in our future research."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.61135001, 61403310)."}], "references": [{"title": "Finding and evaluating community structure in networks", "author": ["M.E.
