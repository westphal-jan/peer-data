Propagation and search must generally be complicated due to the NP completeness of the CSPs. Therefore, finding a fair balance between efficiency in terms of computation time and effective performance in terms of filtering has always been an important issue in the constraint program community. This paper goes a step further by providing a probable analysis of the constraint network associated with each constraint problem (CSP), leading to a probability-based binary CSP model that allows us to view both the macrostructure (i.e., the interactions between variables by the constraints) and the microstructure as predisposition."}, {"heading": "2 Background material and notations", "text": "We consider the classical definition of binary constraint networks. A binary constraint network N is a triplet < X, D, C >, where X is a set of n variables, D is the set of their finite domains, and C is the binary constraints, which are believed to be unique without loss of generality. We write: Cij the set of constraints between Xi and Xj, C (Xi) the set of constraints in which Xi is involved, and \u0439 (Xi) the set of network solutions, that is, the values in D1 x... \u00d7 Dn that satisfy all constraints of Cij alone; \u03c0i the i-th projection of Nn. Constraint propagation aims to recognize values in Civicivicivicivicivicivicivici when Civicivicivicivicivicivicivicivicivici and Civicivicivicivicivicivicivicivicivicivici is when Civicivicivicivicivicivicivici is."}, {"heading": "3 A probabilistic-based model for CSP", "text": "The solution methods often focus on the state of a variable within the network called microstructure. In addition, the solution methods use criteria based on statistical information based on the past states of variables / constraints. However, such a standpoint loses a lot of information because no information about the future state of the network is taken into account and the global structure of the network is ignored. In this section, we present an original probabilistic model for binary CSP that allows us to define criteria based on the future state of variables that take into account both the macro structure and the microstructure of the constraint network. Assuming that a domain is modified, we want to know which values are more likely than arc inconsistent. First, we introduce a probabilistic model of the network that allows us to properly define the domain modifications as probable events."}, {"heading": "3.1 Probabilistic model for arc-inconsistency", "text": "First, we can explain in detail how to calculate the probability for a value of a given variable (none of the possible values); second, we can go a step further by estimating the expectation of the number of arc-inconsistent values in a range where a variable value (a potential event) occurs (a potential event); second, by anticipating the expectation of the number of arc-inconsistent values in a range where a variable value (a potential event) occurs (a potential event). An interesting question about predicting the meaning of the value w could be its ability to be consistent. Then, basic information must be formalized if it is assumed that at least 3 values could be removed from Dj (b)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Propagation of the probabilistic information", "text": "Given the limitation of the N network, the function that calculates the probability for a given probability is considered consistent.
