QAP was introduced by Koopmans and Beckmann (1957). It can be defined as a problem to assign a plant to a location specified with mutual distances between sites and mutual flow between facilities. The goal is to assign each plant to a location where the total cost is minimized so as to minimize the total cost of the plant. Also, the number of plants and locations where n = (dkl) is set as input, so that all elements are real, and let fij between plants and facilities j, dkl the distance between the site and the location. Also, let n the number of plants and locations where n = {1, 2, 3,. The formulation of the QAP can be defined as follows (Koopmans and Beckmann 1957): min."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "Chunguo Wu, Na Zhang, Jingqing Jiang, Jinhui Yang and Yanchun Liang (2007) have proposed a novel approach to solving the problem of workplace planning by using the Bacteria Foraging Algorithm. Chunguo Wu et al. have described that BFO is an evolutionary calculation algorithm based on the feeding behavior of Ecoli bacteria, and it is a random search algorithm. The main objective of the BFO algorithm is to eliminate those bacteria that have weak feeding methods and maintain those bacteria that have pioneering feeding methods to maximize energy per unit of time. S. Subramanian and S. Padma (2011) have described that it is used to minimize costs and improve efficiency in parallel by using multiobjective BFO optimization methods. Jing Dang et al. (2008) have described the BFO elimination algorithm as the next algorithm that generates life-cycle signals inspired by other bacteria."}, {"heading": "3 Bacteria Foraging Algorithm", "text": "The BFO method introduced by Kevin M. Passino (2002) is to eliminate these bacteria, which ultimately have bacteria that have breakthrough dietary methods to maximize the energy obtained per unit time. In this process, each bacterium communicates with other bacteria by sending signals in which bacteria proceed to the next step to collect nutrients when previous factors have been satisfied. BFO is based on four principal parts: 1) chemotactic, 2) heating, 3) reproduction, and 4) elimination and dispersion. Das et al. 2009).3.1 ChemotacticIn biological terms, the chemotactic process of moving bacteria for food collection is the chemotactic process. The Ecoli bacteria can move in two different ways, swimming and diving."}, {"heading": "4 Multiobjective Bacteria Foraging Algorithm", "text": "In the BFO algorithm, bacteria try to find concentrated nutrients to avoid harmful substrates. In this case, there is only one goal that the search explores. Instead, Multijective Bacterial Foraging Optimization (MOBFO) focuses on solving multi-objective optimization problems. The main goal of such problems is to find all values that may be fulfilled for all fitness functions. Since different decision makers have different ideas about fitness functions, it is not easy to find a single solution to multi-objective optimization problems without interacting with decision makers. Therefore, the MOBFO presents a series of pareto-optimal solutions for decision makers. The main goal of multi-objective optimization problems is to obtain a non-dominated front that comes close to the true Pareto front. Thereafter, the MOBFO is proposed with the integration between health sorting approach and pareto-dominance solutions to multi-objective MOBFO problems."}, {"heading": "5 Proposed Method", "text": "Bacteria feed algorithm is one of the bio-inspired algorithms that can solve QAP. Since QAP is a non-linear problem, most likely sensible solutions can be achieved with deterministic algorithms (P.Ji et al. 2006).The reason why BFO was chosen to solve QAP problems is that both are geometrically relevant to find the solutions. In addition, BFO representation is an optimization algorithm that can avoid locally optimal solutions in elimination and distribution step and leads to a global optimum. So, many times NP-hard problems like QAP that need to be stopped by local optima, with optimization algorithms like BFO.In this paper, BFO and MOBFO are used for solving QAP and mQAP. The chemotactic step is the updating part of BFO in which we use some of GA (K. Deb et al 2002) operators as well as crossover operator and transmitter operator."}, {"heading": "5.1.1 Mutation", "text": "As mentioned above, the mutation operator modifies the current solution in the updated part of the algorithm (step 2, chemotactic). In this algorithm, we used three different mutation methods: swap mutation (Banzhaf, W 1990), which is one of the simplest mutation methods; p / 3 mutation (P. LARRAN et al. 1999); and inversion mutation (Fogel, D. B 1990). The results indicate that BFO is more adaptable with the swap mutation method.In the swap mutation, two places in the solution are randomly selected and exchanged; in the p / 3 mutation method, the given solution size (p) is divided into 3 blocks and behaves like a swap mutation, i.e. two blocks are randomly selected and exchanged; and in the inversion mutation, two random numbers in the solution size are generated and the corresponding range of these random numbers are converted into a new solution."}, {"heading": "5.1.2 Tabu Search", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate until it is able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Uniform Like Crossover", "text": "Essentially, crossover is a completely random operator that transfers information from parents to offspring. So far, many types of crossover are available for different purposes, here we have selected one of very famous ones. The operator Uniform Like Crossover (ULX) was introduced by Tate and Smith (1995) and applies mainly permutation-based solutions. Crossover combines two permutations A and B of size P and creates a new solution. Likewise, ULX Crossover compares the elements in A and B and copies the same elements with the solution. After that, one of the A and B is selective, based on solutions. The first element of this permutation transfers bacteria to the first site in the solution and creates a new solution. Then, for the second site, the second element of a permutation other than bit is transferred. If the transferred element is repeated twice, it does not need to be transmitted."}, {"heading": "6 Experimental Results", "text": "The experimental environment is P4 PC machine with 1GB of memory; operating system is windows 7; software development is MATLAB 2010a. We tested our BFO on 14 instances in QAPLIB. The results were compared with original BFO solutions previously available in QAPLIB. Table 1 shows the algorithm settings available in QAPLIB. Also, the standard deviation (SD) of our BFO and the results obtained for P. Ji et al (2006) and Z. Drezner (2003) were compared. Table 1 shows the algorithm settings tested in QAPLIB. Table 2 shows the results of individual objective distances. It can be determined that our BFO is better than the original BFO results in terms of optimal results. Andour BFO performed better than Z. Drezner (2003) and P. Ji et al (2006) when the problem is not large."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "Since QAP is a NP-hard problem, its solution cannot be achieved in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, this is one of the reasons why scientists are trying to find an adaptive combinatorial optimization algorithm to address this problem. To this end, we modified the BFO algorithm for the solution of QAP and mQAP. The proposed algorithm is also based on the optimization of bacteria that have been developed in two ways: single-objective optimization and multi-objective optimization. To this end, two genetic algorithms have been used to update the mechanisms, crossover and mutation, to update the solutions."}, {"heading": "8 Compliance with Ethical Standards:", "text": "Conflict of Interest: Author S.
