While the explicit channel transmits overt messages, the implicit ones transmit hidden messages about the communicator (e.g., his/her intentions and attitudes). There is a growing consensus that providing a computer with the ability to manipulate implicit affective cues should allow for a more meaningful and natural way of studying particular non-verbal signals of human-human communications by human-computer interactions. In this pilot study, we created a non-dynamic human-computer interaction while manipulating three specific non-verbal channels of communication: gaze pattern, facial expression, and gesture. Participants rated the virtual agent on affective dimensional scales (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) while their physiological signal (electrodermal activity, EDA) was captured during the interaction. Assessment of the behavioral data revealed a significant and complex three-way interaction between gaze, gesture, and facial configuration on the dimension of pleasure, as well as a main effect of gesture on the dimension of dominance. These results suggest a complex relationship between different non-verbal cues and the social context in which they are interpreted. Qualifying considerations as well as possible next steps are further discussed in light of these exploratory findings.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 22:41:50 GMT  (727kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04165v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI", "authors": ["katie hoemann", "behnaz rezaei", "stacy c marsella", "sarah ostadabbas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04165"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.04165.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Using Virtual Humans to Understand Real Ones", "authors": ["Katie Hoemann", "Behnaz Rezaei", "Stacy C.

Hypotheses", "text": "In general, we suspect that any non-verbal behavior of the agent influences the participants \"affective assessments. Specifically, we predict that there will be major effects so that the two levels of each condition will have the opposite effect on the effect. For example: a facial configuration of smiling (level 1) leads to increased joy, decreased arousal and increased dominance; while a facial configuration of the furrowed forehead (level 2) leads to decreased joy, increased arousal and decreased dominance. This hypothesis is based on previous work in social psychology, communication and affective computer literature (e.g., [38], [24], [41], [27], [42], [43]."}, {"heading": "III.

Electrodermal Activity Evaluation", "text": "Electrodermal activity consists of two main components: tonic reaction and phasic reaction. Tonic skin conductivity refers to the current or basic level of skin conductivity in the absence of certain discrete environmental events. Phasic skin conductivity refers to event-induced changes caused by a momentary increase in skin conductivity (similar to a peak superimposed on the tonic skin conductivity), which is sampled at a higher frequency (more than 100 Hz), then filtered and sampled according to a specific order. However, in order to achieve good classification results with pattern recognition and machine learning, the EDA sensor used for this experiment with a frequency sampling of 4 Hz is too low to provide an accurate and reliable measurement of electrodermal activity."}, {"heading": "C. Classification Results", "text": "Most of them are part of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques. Classifiers such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and others [46], are useful to identify emotional classes of interest. Regression techniques [46] can also be used to obtain a continuous estimate of emotions for example in the valence-arousal space. Before concluding emotional states, it is important to define some physiological traits of interest. It is very difficult to find certain traits in physiological signals that always correlate with the affective status of users. These variables often differ from one user to another and they are also very sensitive to the daily variations, as well as to the context of emotion induction."}, {"heading": "IV.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "Both Behnaz Rezaei and Katie Hoemann designed the procedure: Katie chose the psychological measures and Behnaz the physiological measures. Both Katie and Behnaz designed and developed the characteristics of the virtual agents and the VR scenarios. Katie wrote the scenario dialogs, recorded the audio files and cleaned them and contributed to the configuration of the assets and to the generation of the BML code for the virtual figure. Behnaz completed all the encodings and scripts of the scenarios as well as additional plant configurations.Katie was the primary author for the introduction, related work, psychological approaches / methods, behavioural outcomes and discussion sections. Behnaz was the primary author for the physiological approach / methods and physiological data evaluation / outcomes. The authors would like to thank Dr. Stacy Marsella for his continued support and suggestions for the appropriate software platform for the realization of this project. Dan Feng was instrumental in the support throughout the development process - and we would not have been able to learn this without the BML language, including the language."}], "references": [{"title": "Probabilistic assessment of user\u2019s emotions in educational games", "author": ["C.

"abstractText": "Human interactions are characterized by explicit as well as implicit channels of communication. While the explicit channel transmits overt messages, the implicit ones transmit hidden messages about the communicator (e.g., his/her intentions and attitudes). There is a growing consensus that providing a computer with the ability to manipulate implicit affective cues should allow for a more meaningful and natural way of studying particular non-verbal signals of human-human communications by human-computer interactions [1], [2]. In this pilot study, we created a non-dynamic human-computer interaction while manipulating three specific non-verbal channels of communication: gaze pattern, facial expression, and gesture. Participants rated the virtual agent on affective dimensional scales (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) while their physiological signal (electrodermal activity, EDA) was captured during the interaction. Assessment of the behavioral data revealed a significant and complex three-way interaction between gaze, gesture, and facial configuration on the dimension of pleasure, as well as a main effect of gesture on the dimension of dominance. These results suggest a complex relationship between different non-verbal cues and the social context in which they are interpreted. Qualifying considerations as well as possible next steps are further discussed in light of these exploratory findings.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
