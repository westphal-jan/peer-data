We have first estimated an Origin-Destination matrix of buses users from datasets about the ticket validation and GPS positioning of buses. Then we represent the supply of buses with their routes through bus stops as a complex network, which allowed us to understand the bottlenecks of the current scenario and, in particular, applying community discovery techniques, to identify clusters that the service supply infrastructure has. Finally, from the superimposing of the flow of people represented in the OriginDestination matrix in the supply network, we exemplify how micro-interventions can be prospected by means of an example of the introduction of express routes.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 01:44:16 GMT  (978kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04190v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1606.03737"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1606.03737", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["carlos caminha", "vasco furtado", "vl\\'adia pinheiro e caio ponte"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04190"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.04190.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Micro-interventions in urban transport from pattern discovery on the flow of passengers and on the bus network", "authors": ["Carlos Caminha", "Vasco Furtado", "Vl\u00e1dia Pinheiro", "Caio Ponte"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it has come to the point where we are able to put ourselves at the top of the EU, \"he said in an interview with the German Press Agency.\" It is as if we are able to put ourselves at the top of the EU, \"he said.\" But it is not that we are able to integrate into the EU. \""}, {"heading": "A.

The stops are places where passengers board and disembark. In total, this data set has 4783 geo-referenced data sets. Bus lines have 359 data sets that contain information about the direction of the route and its itinerary. Bus stops, the smallest of the data sets, as they only have seven data sets, a terminal is a place designed to provide a better service when transhifting the user, different bus routes pass through terminals. the bus GPS data sets have around 104 million data sets.

Generating the Origin-Destination Matrix", "text": "The problem we were faced with was that the raw data did not allow us to say exactly where the passenger had boarded the bus because they included the time in which a particular user had validated his ticket at the bus stop. However, this geographical coordination is not necessarily the origin of the passenger, since he / she did not check the validity of the ticket at the bus stop. He / she might have stayed, for example, at the back of the bus until the moment the bus approached its destination. We can further minimize this problem as we have not done the validity of the ticket. Unfortunately, with regard to the user's destination, there is no accurate record showing where the passenger got off."}, {"heading": "C. Statistical validation of the representativeness of the OD sample spatial", "text": "It is expected that the samples will guarantee with some degree of reliability that the estimated ODs are correct. A major challenge is to ensure that the sample is not spatially distorted, for example that the embarkations on the bus used in the estimates are not proportional (taking into account the bus stop).To check the total number of embarkations at the bus stops, we have checked the correlation between the embarkations used and the total number of embarkations at the bus stops in Fortaleza."}, {"heading": "A. Public Transport Network", "text": "The transport infrastructure network of buses in a city determines the movement of persons who reach their desired places for the fulfilment of daily activities. In the specific case of the bus network, the nodes are stops, and the bus lines that people run between these stops are the edges. The timetable of a route is the number of stops that are visited during a route. It is said that a route ends its timetable when the bus reaches its last stop.Therefore, we can model a network as a directed graphic, G (V, E), with vertices, V (B), which represent the stops and edges, e (E), delivers between two stops. Formally, the weight of the edge, which represents the bus offer between two stops vi and vj (V).This offer is then calculated from the sum of stops and edges, the weight, the distance of which passes two bus stops, the weight, the weight, the weight, the vehicle, the weight, the total route, the vehicle, the number of vehicles, the route, the number of vehicles, the number of vehicles, the number of vehicles, the vehicle, the weight of the number of the route, the number of vehicles, the number of the vehicle, the number of the vehicle, the number of the vehicle, the number of the route, the number of the number of the vehicles, the number of the vehicle, the number of the number of the vehicle, the number of the number of the route, the number of the vehicle, the number of the vehicle, the number of the number of the vehicle, the number of the distance, the number of the number of the number of the number of the vehicles, the number of the number of the route, the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the bus stops, the number of the bus lines, the number of the bus, the number of the bus, the number of the number of the number of lines, the number of vehicles, the number of the bus, the number of the lines, the number of the bus, the number of the bus, the number of the bus, the number of the lines, the number of the bus, the number of the bus, the number of the bus and the number of the bus lines, the number of the number of the bus, the number of the bus, the number of the bus lines, the number of the bus"}, {"heading": "B.
