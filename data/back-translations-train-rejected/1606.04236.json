Due to storage limitations, placing the optimal content into local caches is crucial. Cache content placement is challenging since it requires knowledge about the content popularity distribution, which is often not available in advance. Moreover, content popularity is subject to fluctuations as mobile users with different interests connect to the caching entity over time. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for context-aware proactive cache content placement. By regularly observing context information of connected users, updating the cache content accordingly and observing the demands for cache content subsequently, the algorithm learns context-specific content popularity online over time. We derive a sub-linear regret bound, which characterizes the learning speed and proves that our algorithm asymptotically maximizes the average number of cache hits. Furthermore, our algorithm supports service differentiation by allowing operators of caching entities to prioritize groups of customers. Our numerical results confirm that by exploiting contextual information, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in a real world data set, with an increase in the number of cache hits of at least 14%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 07:53:47 GMT  (568kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04236v1", "30 pages, 9 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 16 Dec 2016 15:03:53 GMT  (940kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04236v2", "32 pages, 9 figures, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, seethis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "30 pages, 9 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["sabrina m\\\"uller", "onur atan", "mihaela van der schaar", "anja klein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04236"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.04236.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Context-Aware Proactive Content Caching with Service Differentiation in Wireless Networks", "authors": ["Sabrina M\u00fcller", "Onur Atan", "Mihaela van der Schaar", "Anja Klein"], "emails": ["a.klein}@nt.tu-darmstadt.de", "oatan@ucla.edu,", "mihaela@ee.ucla.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before."}, {"heading": "II.

Wireless Caching Entity", "text": "The caching unit is characterized by a limited storage capacity and a reliable backhaul connection to the core network. In its cache memory, the caching unit can store up to m files from a finite content library, where we assume, for convenience, that all files are of the same size. In order to inform users in its environment of available files, the caching unit periodically sends out information about currently buffered files [17] - [19]. If a user is interested in a file that the caching unit has stored in its cache, he requests the file from the caching unit and is served by localized communication. In this case, no additional load is transferred to the macro cache network or backhaul network. If the file is not stored in the caching unit, the user does not request the file from the caching unit."}, {"heading": "B. Customer-Specific Service Differentiation", "text": "Another option is to define the number of cache hits as the target of cache content placement, one reason being the restrictions imposed by net neutrality restrictions. However, for an information station operator, such as a CP or a third-party provider, the goal might not be simple to store the most popular content that has a number of users. On the other hand, the operator could offer differentiated services to its customers (this can be both end users and CPs) by offering different types of service that relate to different levels of prioritization; these types of service could relate to end users and, for example, relate to the pricing policy that is prioritized compared to a user with free access to the cache content, which could mean that popular content is cached preferentially among paying users."}, {"heading": "C. Context-Specific Content Popularity", "text": "The popularity of content is generally not static, but depends on the preferences of a user. From a user's point of view, his personal preferences for content may depend on various factors. We refer to such factors as context dimensions and categorize them into the following classes as summarized in Table II. Personal characteristics are, for example, demographic factors (e.g. age, gender), emotional state and previous experiences. User devices refer to the device type (e.g. smartphone, tablet) that is used to access and consume content, as well as their capabilities and battery status. Environmental conditions are determined, for example, by the location of the user 10 and its characteristics, the time of day or the day of the week, and external events (e.g. football game, concert) that may be both periodic and aperiotic. Of course, this categorization of possible context dimensions is not exhaustive and the effects of each individual dimension on the popularity of content are pre-determined by the data, the user may not be able to access those data (e.g. football game, concert), which may be both periodic and aperiotic. Of course, this categorization of possible context dimensions is not exhaustive, and the effects of each individual dimension on the popularity of content may be unknown from the outset of files, due to the fact that the contextual nature of the caching unit may be required for most of the files currently accessing only part of the files."}, {"heading": "D.

ANALYSIS OF THE REGRET", "text": "In this section, we give an upper limit on the regrets R (T) of the learning algorithm m m-CAC, which is specified in (3). The limit of regrets is based on the natural assumption that the expected demands on the files are similar for similar contexts. For example, at a similar time of day and for users with similar characteristics, there are also similar demands on the files. Such an assumption is crucial to learn from previous observations and can be captured by the following condition. Assumption 1: There is L > 0, \u03b1 > 0 that applies to all f-F and to all x, y-X, that the upper limit of regrets is the same."}, {"heading": "VI. MEMORY REQUIREMENTS", "text": "The memory requirement of m-CAC is mainly determined by the counter values that the algorithm keeps during its runtime. If m-CAC is executed with the parameters of theorem 1, the number of records in PT is limited by (hT) D = dT 1 3\u03b1 + D \u2264 2DT D 3\u03b1 + D. The required memory is thus limited by | F | 2DT D 3\u03b1 + D above and thus sublinear in the time horizon T. This means that the algorithm for T \u2192 \u221e would require infinite memory. However, for practical approaches only the counter values of such records p above the limit to which at least one of the context vectors of the connected users has already belonged."}, {"heading": "VII.

Exploiting the Multicast Gain", "text": "So far, we have assumed that during the delivery phase of each time window t, with each content request, a file will be delivered immediately to the requesting user. To this end, however, our algorithm can be expanded to benefit from the broadcast character of the wireless medium through multicasting, which has proven beneficial for caching in small cell networks [13]. To this end, each time window t is divided into a number of intervals. Within each of these intervals, user requests are monitored and accumulated, and after a short waiting period, the user requests monitored in the meantime are served. Such multicast transmissions reduce the traffic required for data transmission. In order to exploit the knowledge acquired so far about the popularity of content, user requests for files with low estimated demand could be served immediately, thereby preventing unnecessary delays in cases where another user request and thus multicast transmission could not be met, for example, with high priority."}, {"heading": "B. Rating-Based Context-Aware Proactive Caching", "text": "In the previous sections, we assumed that the caching company would perform the placement of cache content relative to the requirements of the content, i.e. the number of df (x) requests, to maximize the number of (weighted) cache hits. However, in the case of a CP operating an info station, its goal might be not only to store the frequently requested content, but also to get high ratings from its end users. Consider the case where end users rate content according to their consumption in a range [rmin, rmax]. R +. For a context x, we let rf (x) be the random variable that describes a user's rating with context x when requesting a file f and then evaluating it. 4 Then we define the random variable df (x): = 0 if the file f is not requested (x), if the file f is requested, (7) 4g., no request may be given and no ratings may be given in the range."}, {"heading": "C. Asynchronous User Arrival", "text": "So far, we have assumed that within a timeframe, the very users who are connected to the local caching unit in monitoring the user context will request files after updating the cache content. However, if the user connects asynchronously to the local caching unit, our proposed algorithm should be adjusted. If, after updating the cache content, a user disconnects directly and does not request a file even though he has been considered for cache content placement, it should be taken into account that his vanishing demand is the result of disconnection, i.e. he should be neglected when updating estimated requirements. Therefore, in m-CAC, counters are not updated to disconnect users. If a user connects to the local caching unit after placing cache content, his context has not been taken into account in the caching decision. However, his requests can be used to learn faster by updating the estimated requirements based on his requests."}, {"heading": "VIII.

This algorithm works on the assumption of foresight, i.e., complete knowledge of user requirements within the coming timeframe. The optimal oracle selects the highest number of requests within this timeframe. The second reference algorithm is called m-UCB, which consists of a variant of the UCB algorithm. UCB is a classic learning algorithm for multi-armed bandit problems [34], which embraces logarithmic regret, not taking into account context information, i.e. logarithmic regret is related to the average expected demand over the entire context space. Whereas in the classical UCB an action is taken in each timeframe, the logarithmic regret is not taken into account."}, {"heading": "C.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we introduced a context-sensitive, proactive caching algorithm based on contextual, multi-armed bandits for placing cache content with a local caching unit on a wireless network. In order to deal with unknown and fluctuating popularity of content within the ever-changing local user population, the algorithm regularly monitors context information of connected users, updates cache content, and monitors demand for cached content. As a result, over time, the algorithm learns context-specific content popularity online, enabling proactive customization of cache content according to the fluctuating popularity of local content. In addition, we derived a sublinear 28bound due diligence that describes how quickly the algorithm converts to optimal cache content placement and proves that our proposed algorithm asymptotically evaluates the average number of cache hits in addition to the algorithm's ability to support cache algorithms."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The work of Sabrina Mu \u00bc ller and Anja Klein was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) as part of the project B03 in the Collaborative Research Centre (SFB) 1053 - MAKI.

to improve the efficiency in wireless content delivery. Due to storage limitations, placing the optimal content into local caches is crucial. Cache content placement is challenging since it requires knowledge about the content popularity distribution, which is often not available in advance. Moreover, content popularity is subject to fluctuations as mobile users with different interests connect to the caching entity over time. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for context-aware proactive cache content placement. By regularly observing context information of connected users, updating the cache content accordingly and observing the demands for cache content subsequently, the algorithm learns contextspecific content popularity online over time. We derive a sub-linear regret bound, which characterizes the learning speed and proves that our algorithm asymptotically maximizes the average number of cache hits. Furthermore, our algorithm supports service differentiation by allowing operators of caching entities to prioritize groups of customers. Our numerical results confirm that by exploiting contextual information, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in a real world data set, with an increase in the number of cache hits of at least 14%.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
