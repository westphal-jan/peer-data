Motivated by the desire to understand users \"movement patterns, this paper presents a new data structure, the context tree, which summarizes the context behind users\" actions in a single hierarchical model. Furthermore, the paper proposes a method for generating context trees from geospatial trajectories and land use information, and provides concrete implementations for each stage of the method, namely augmentation, filtering and clustering. A context tree itself consists of clusters on multiple scales describing the contexts in which the user was immersed, a simple collection of information that would have previously remained hidden, and forms the basis for understanding and predicting the actions and behaviors of groups and individuals."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "These techniques identify areas where time has been spent but are unable to identify locations where non-stationary activities have taken place.

Privacy concerns are the main obstacle to making such data publicly available, and as a result, there are only a limited number of public data sets, each of which has some drawbacks. To overcome these problems, many researchers have collected data for their own work [Ashbrook and Starner, 2003; Si la-Nowicka et al., 2015; Thomason et al., 2015a]. However, the use of such private data sets reduces the reproducibility of work, and thus the use of public data is preferred.

A significant location determination, for example, can extract places on different scales and therefore there cannot be a single basic truth. Existing literature addresses this by examining the properties of the results of such techniques and comparing these properties with expected results. Thus, Guidotti et al. [2015] create synthetic trajectories with known properties and develop metrics to compare extracted places with desirable properties. Thomason et al. [2015a] compare properties of the identified places with acceptable ranges of values derived from the knowledge of the input data, as well as the applicability of the technique using examples. For classification in travel mode, Si laNowicka et al. [2015] compare the results with a small group of manually labeled subtrajectories.

Each leaf node of the tree represents a real feature or element with which the user is likely to have interacted, be it a specific building, area, or individual feature (e.g. a bank in a park). These individual elements are connected by context nodes that represent a context on a particular scale, where the time the user has spent within a context is likely to have had similar goals or goals, and is identified by exploring the time the user spends with elements with similar properties or elements that are interacted with in a similar way.

A trajectory is a temporal sequence of data points that locate a person or entity: T = (p1, p2, p3,..., pn), where pi = {ti, li, ai} is an individual trajectory point consisting of time (ti), place (li, e.g. a < lat, lng > pair) and accuracy (ai, typically measured in meters). In addition to such trajectories, land usage data may also be used to identify locations and entities that are significant to the user. Land usage data are viewed as sets of units with associated information. In this case, a unit directly represents an object, characteristic, or area, e.g. a postcard, a unit, or field, the land usage data is considered to be combined into a residential unit or a residential unit."}, {"heading": "4.1 Element Extraction", "text": "The process of obtaining relevant land use elements is illustrated in Figure 3. A raw geological trajectory (Step 1) is superimposed on a land use dataset (Step 2), using the accuracy recorded by a positioning device (e.g. GPS, measured in meters) (Step 3), so that all elements that are fully or partially within the radius are stored next to the original trajectory point (Step 4). This process is automatically completed by iterating through each trajectory point and queriing the land use dataset for each element that intersects or covers part of the radius of accuracy."}, {"heading": "4.2 Filtering", "text": "Since the element extraction method (Section 4.1) extends the trajectories with all land use elements that are within the accuracy radius of a trajectory point, it tends to record a significant number of elements with which the user has not interacted. To cope with these noise elements, a filtering method can be used. Our proposed filter is a generalized version of a weighted average filter, a technique typically used to smooth out noisy signals, modified to work across sets of land use elements and shown in Figure 4. The filter receives a Bu filter of elements and selects from this Bu filter based on an assigned weight in a three-step process: 1. A Bu filter of points and associated land use data is selected. 2. Land use elements in the Bu filter are weighted and evaluated. 3. Elements are selected based on their inclusion in the output."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Bu\u21b5er Selection", "text": "Due to the nature of the geospatial data acquisition systems, a continuous and even development over time is not to be assumed, and therefore the selection of an index based on a fixed number of points would be inappropriate. Instead, we use a fixed time width for the index and consider all points that fall within this period. (An index therefore consists of a point that comes under consideration, and the points that fall within seconds immediately before or after it.) The pseudo-code for maintaining such an index is represented in the 1.ALGORITHM 1 bus er Management1 algorithm: points (p1, p2,...) / / Input index 2: 300 / / / Input parameters that specify the width of an index is displayed in the 1.ALGORITHM 1 bus er Management1 algorithm: points (p1, p2,...) / / Input index 2: 300 / / / / Input parameters that specify the width of the index (points): [5 / / point: / 7 / / / / point: The index / 7 / / / / / point is built."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Scoring", "text": "The points are then applied to each land use element in the busier, weighted by the number of points the element is associated with, the accuracy of these points, and the time distance from the point under consideration. Since we are dealing with quantities and not the filter that simply averages the values over the busier, the process is modified by assigning weighted values to each set element and then selecting elements according to a threshold. Combining these factors into a score results in: Score (e) = Xp2Pe \u2713 1 ap \u2713 1 dist (p, pc). | Pe | (1) where Pe is the set of all points associated with element e, ap is the accuracy value of point p (in meters, so that low values indicate that there is likely to be less noise), PC is the point under consideration, the width of the busier (p, pc)."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Selection", "text": "When each element in the bus is assigned a score, the selection can be made either by using a fixed threshold to discard low-score elements, or by limiting all elements to their score by using soft thresholds. Soft threshold is a technique commonly used in signal processing where a core is applied to the calculated scores, bringing higher values closer to 1 and lower values closer to 0. While soft threshold eliminates the need to apply a fixed threshold, this work is only about whether or not an element is included in the output set, and therefore we use a threshold, t, where each element with a normal score is greater than t part of the output set and the remaining elements are discarded."}, {"heading": "4.3 Data Summarisation", "text": "Once filtered, advanced trajectories contain a record of where a person was at a given time, along with the real characteristics with which they were likely to interact. These interactions are summarized into continuous periods of time, taking into account each land-use element encountered. If the same land-use unit is associated with two consecutive points, it can be assumed that it is also associated with the period between these points, if such a period is clearly small. An example summary is shown in Figure 4 (right). If the time between two consecutive points is large, it cannot be determined whether the user has stopped interacting with an element and resumed before the next occurrence of data collection, and thus a time limit between two consecutive points associated with the same element is given as tmax. If the time between two consecutive points is greater than tmax, then the interactions are split, a technique that can also be used in applications for location extraction of 2016, Montoason, 2010 and Thomatica, during Perez."}, {"heading": "5 Contextual Clustering", "text": "The identification of similar contexts takes place through clustering, which takes into account both the characteristics of the elements and the characteristics of the user interactions in order to identify similarities. Rather than aiming to identify a single level of clusters that would limit the usefulness and applicability of the clusters to a single scale, the goal here is to build a hierarchical model that is built by gradually merging land-use elements that represent similar contexts in a context tree, the representation of which was previously shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "5.1 Building Clusters", "text": "First of all, each land use element is different and is treated as a singleton cluster (i.e. a cluster with exactly one element).Each cluster formation merges several of these clusters to represent a context and a new higher level in the hierarchy, with pointers between the layers considered to be parents and children. That is, when two clusters are merged at one level into another cluster, the original clusters are considered to be children of the new cluster.This section describes how clusters are merged in terms of their characteristics.

The calculated values are between 0 and 1 (inclusive), where a score of 1 means that the words are interchangeable. Therefore, the semantic similarity between two groups of tags, t1 and t2, is called: TagSim (t1, t2) = P t2t1 argmaxSim (Sim (t, t21), Tagtags (t, t22), Sim (t, t2ci) | Tag (t2) = similarity (Slarity) (Slarity) (Slarity) (Slarity) (Slarity) (Slarity), Slarity (Slarity) = similarity (Slarity), Slarity (1), Slarity (1, Slarity (1), Slarity (1, Slarity), Slarity (22), Slarity (22), Slarity (Slarity)."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Feature Similarity", "text": "The context of an activity or period of time depends not only on the place where the time is spent, but also on additional factors.

This is achieved by examining the properties of the generated context trees and comparing them with expected results, while providing small, representative examples demonstrating the effectiveness of a section shown by these procedures. This section evaluates the proposed context tree data structure, along with the production method proposed in Sections 4 and 5.

The aim of filtering is to remove noise and focus the data on elements with which the user is likely to have interacted at a particular time. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the elements after filtering should be more similar than before, with less variation caused by the inclusion of random elements. To investigate this hypothesis, Figure 11 shows the average similarity of the key elements (i.e. only the key part of the \"key: value\" pair that makes up the tags of an element of a broad type, such as \"buildings\") both before and after filtering for a particular user over 1000 points of its data.

Figures 12a and 12b show that increasing tmax leads to fewer but longer periods of time being extracted. In the rest of this paper, we use tmax = 1200 (i.e. 20 minutes) because it provides enough time for a user to have stopped interacting with an element and resumed later, without splitting too many interactions unnecessarily."}, {"heading": "6.4 User-informed Evaluation", "text": "In fact, it is such that the majority of them are in a position to survive themselves without there being a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process, to a process in which there is a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process in which there is a process, to a process, to a process in which there is a process, to a process, to a process in which there is a process, to a process, to a process, to a process in which there is a process, to a process, to a process, to a process to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process, to a process"}, {"heading": "6.5 Context Trees", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it is only a matter of time before a decision is made, until a decision is made."}, {"heading": "7 Context Tree Pruning", "text": "When context trees are fully stored, the maximum amount of information is retained, but there are applications where reducing the size of a tree may be desirable.

Sets of tags are combined from the parent clusters by incorporating their association, while times and coordinate sets are merged in a way that combines overlapping components into individual elements, and thus, by combining child clusters into a parent cluster, information is removed.
