However, the time of the structured SSCSP solution requires a linear operation at the distance between A and B and the time of the BFS depends on the structure of the graph. However, the comparison of the two approaches immediately shows that in the iteration i of the structured SSCSP solution all nodes are required which depend on the implementation and the architecture that is available. The structured SSCSP solution can be regarded as a kind of parallel version of the BFS. However, if there are sufficiently many parallel processes available and with the corresponding implementation, BFS may have a similar runtime. The time complexity of the graphics solution depends on the implementation and the architecture. The structured SSCSP solution can be regarded as a kind of parallel version of the BFS."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We compared the approach to a symbolic graph search algorithm by estimating the amount of physical work required to construct a shortest path. We came to the conclusion that the structure and complexity of both approaches can easily be mapped to each other. This is surprising, since the solution to the problem occurs immediately with mild abstraction, i.e. through the use of physical objects; we are not aware of the internal structure and physical complexity of the approach. In comparison, the symbolic graph-based algorithm can only be designed and applied with available knowledge of data and diagrams. What is the reason for our perception of the different complexity of the symbolic approach versus the physical problem-solving approach to the shortest path problem? In the symbolic approach, we compose algorithms from structurally simple elements, taking advantage of knowledge of the length of the path segments and explicitly combining these elements to build, in essence, the network of the paths of the network, the paths of the parts of the network we do not yield, the parts of the network."}], "references": [{"title": "A note on two problems in connexion with graphs", "author": ["E.W.
