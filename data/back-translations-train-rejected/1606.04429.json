Being able to pick out representative words within a document can lead to substantial improvements in document clustering. In the case of web documents, the HTML markup that defines the layout of the content provides additional structural information that can be further exploited to identify representative words. In this paper we introduce a fuzzy term weighing approach that makes the most of the HTML structure for document clustering. We set forth and build on the hypothesis that a good representation can take advantage of how humans skim through documents to extract the most representative words. The authors of web pages make use of HTML tags to convey the most important message of a web page through page elements that attract the readers' attention, such as page titles or emphasized elements. We define a set of criteria to exploit the information provided by these page elements, and introduce a fuzzy combination of these criteria that we evaluate within the context of a web page clustering task. Our proposed approach, called Abstract Fuzzy Combination of Criteria (AFCC), can adapt to datasets whose features are distributed differently, achieving good results compared to other similar fuzzy logic based approaches and TF-IDF across different datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 15:44:52 GMT  (1854kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04429v1", "This is the accepted version of an article accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems"]], "COMMENTS": "This is the accepted version of an article accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["alberto p garc\\'ia-plaza", "v\\'ictor fresno", "raquel mart\\'inez", "arkaitz zubiaga"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04429"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.04429.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Using Fuzzy Logic to Leverage HTML Markup for Web Page Representation", "authors": ["Alberto P.

Study of FCC and Individual Criteria", "text": "As an initial comparative study of the existing FCC approach, we propose and analyze four variations of this term, taking into account one for each criterion so that the system's output only depends on one criterion at a time. Table I shows an example rule for a system that relies solely on the emphasis criterion to determine output. We used the MFT reduction because it selects the most highly weighted characteristics without transforming them. This allows us to perform a fairer comparison of different term weights.Table II and Figure 2 show the results of each criterion versus FCC, where each column shows performance for different characteristics ranging from 100 to 5,000, as well as the average.For bank search, FCC outperforms all individual alternatives and shows the importance of the combination of criteria. Among the individual criteria, frequency is best, while position is the root. Results for Web KB are very different."}, {"heading": "B.

AFCC: ANALYZING AND TUNING THE MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS", "text": "We are now putting forward a Membership Function Customization Proposal that will lead to the definition of a revised and novel approach called the Abstract Fuzzy Combination of Criteria (AFCC). First, we will perform a qualitative analysis of the membership features we use, and then we will test AFCC by evaluating and analyzing its performance in comparison to the techniques previously studied."}, {"heading": "A. Analysis of the Membership Functions", "text": "It is worth remembering that different datasets for each criterion have different frequency distributions. Few terms in a collection tend to be in many documents, while many terms are rarely used. The effect of normalizing frequencies in terms of the most common term is that low values are compressed and therefore underrepresented, and this compression effect would be exacerbated if the total maximum of the collection were used for the normalization process. In fact, what we call high or low fuzzy sets for FCC and EFCC are symmetrically defined, with the exception of highlighting. Therefore, some of the fuzzy sets defined for FCC and EFCC would correspond to the initial state of most tuning processes of fuzzy rule-based systems. In fact, what we call high or low are not absolute values, but relative values. Therefore, a term is considered important because its normalized frequency is higher than most others, and a certain value that is high, or low depends on the frequency of each term being distributed as 1)."}, {"heading": "B. Tuning of the Membership Functions", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "C. Empirical Analysis of AFCC", "text": "Since AFCC is a modification of the fuzzy logic-based approach, we use FCC and EFCC as baselines, as well as TF-IDF. We apply the MFT reduction in all cases to compare the weight functions in the same conditions.Table IX and Figure 7 show F1 values for these representations. On the one hand, by looking at the results under the fuzzy logic-based representations, AFCC outperforms the rest in WebKB in all cases, while in Banksearch better results are obtained than the others with 2 out of 5 vector sizes, with a higher average F1 score. This could be due to the fact that the frequency distributions in Banksearch are rather harmless."}, {"heading": "D. Statistical significance", "text": "In addition, we include FCC in the comparison. We are interested to see the global improvements of the new AFCC proposal with respect to the original baseline. We divided each data set into 100 different partial sets, which are 50% smaller than the original, with the size of each category in relation to the original. We conducted 100 experiments per vector size corresponding to each partial set, resulting in a total of 4,500 different cluster experiments. We calculated the statistical significance between the F1 values of each pair of representations (AFCC-FCC, EFCC-FCC, AFCC-EFCC) with a coupled two-step t test for each vector size. In Table X and Figure 9, we show for each vector size and representation the average F1 values of the 100 cluster sets (one per sub-dataset, AFCC-EFCC) the better results in terms of the composition of the FCC and the better results in terms of the average results between the respective serums and the representation of the composition we determine."}, {"heading": "VIII.

Being able to pick out representative words within a document can lead to substantial improvements in document clustering. In the case of web documents, the HTML markup that defines the layout of the content provides additional structural information that can be further exploited to identify representative words. In this paper we introduce a fuzzy term weighing approach that makes the most of the HTML structure for document clustering. We set forth and build on the hypothesis that a good representation can take advantage of how humans skim through documents to extract the most representative words. The authors of web pages make use of HTML tags to convey the most important message of a web page through page elements that attract the readers\u2019 attention, such as page titles or emphasized elements. We define a set of criteria to exploit the information provided by these page elements, and introduce a fuzzy combination of these criteria that we evaluate within the context of a web page clustering task. Our proposed approach, called Abstract Fuzzy Combination of Criteria (AFCC), can adapt to datasets whose features are distributed differently, achieving good results compared to other similar fuzzy logic based approaches and TF-IDF across different datasets.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
