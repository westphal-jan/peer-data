DATA AND METHODS", "text": "We have therefore collected our own data, covering almost all Supreme Court cases from October 2007 to June 2012."}, {"heading": "III. RESULTS", "text": "Given the severe limitations on exact matches in previous and subsequent cases, our results are surprisingly rich. Due to time constraints, we analyzed only 100 of the original 944 snippets; we found seven cases of precedent-setting amicus-short language that warranted further attention. Manually analyzing our results is a difficult task, as the legal language must be carefully considered for the following conditions. This decision whether a snippet is an amicus-set precedent (ASP) is not always straightforward. The snippet is \"interesting,\" i.e. the linguistic overlap is more significant than just a turn of the phrase (noise). 2) The snippet had no precedent before it was used by the amicus. Specifically, it is not a quote or direct paraphrase from previous laws or opinions of the Supreme Court (this review was necessary by limiting exact matches to Lexis Advance. 3) The language is not from the petition."}, {"heading": "A. Third-party language", "text": "First, in Wal-Mart v. Dukes (OT 2010), Wal-Mart filed the largest class-action lawsuit in U.S. history, in which six women alleged that the company systematically discriminated against female employees. In a 5-4 decision in favor of WalMart, the court found that the six defendants could not represent all 1.5 million female employees of the company as one class, overturning earlier decisions that had upheld the class-action suit. In its amicus letter in support of Wal-Mart, Intel Corporation cited from a review of class-action lawsuits. Although this article was published in a respected revision of the law, it was the work of an academic - after the Supreme Court joined Intel to quote verbatim from the article, its language gained federal presidential status. Since 2011, the exact wording has been cited in 108 cases (See Figure 2). This is a relatively common type of ASP: Third-party language gains precedent after being used in an Amicus."}, {"heading": "B. Original amicus language", "text": "A second class of overlaps can be found in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. Caperton challenged the constitutionality of a judge who did not recall a case in which one of the parties donated $3 million to his campaign. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that it was indeed unconstitutional for a judge not to withdraw on the basis of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. The Conference of Chief Justices filed a brief in which they discussed the implications of the upcoming decision and how they might affect public confidence in the judicial system. Majority opinion attributes the original language from the letter directly as a concise summary of one of the key points of the case. In this case, the original short language reached a federal precedent. In fact, the exact quotation of opinion in Fig. 3 was cited nine times after the decision. This type of overlapping language is most striking - amicus language is used in the majority opinion as the authority and subsequent precedent of the ruling."}, {"heading": "C. Amicus paraphrase", "text": "One example is Givenin Padilla v. Kentucky, where Padilla argued that it is a lawyer's duty to advise on the risk of deportation in a criminal case. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that, in the context of the Sixth Amendment, a lawyer is in fact obliged to advise his client on the risks of deportation. Elena Kagan, then Solicitor General (and current Supreme Court Justice), made a brief plea for a stricter definition of the roles and duties of the council in the adversarial system of the United States. In her letter, Kagan uses an earlier opinion of the Supreme Court, but paraphrases it emphatically with her own language quoted directly from the opinion (see Figure 4)."}, {"heading": "IV. LIMITATIONS", "text": "Our findings have several limitations. First, none of us is familiar with legal specifics to determine the relevance and factual accuracy of our findings; the evidence seems strong enough to worry about the results presented here, but much of the linguistic overlap we find could be considered common practice or uninteresting by a lawyer; the main technical limitation of our method is the exact search within Lexis Advance; with a \"softer\" method of searching, we would have been able to automatically obtain potentially more and higher-quality results, for example, because we could have ignored cases where an amicus cited previous federal precedents with only minor changes; manually sorting out such cases was a tedious and potentially error-prone task; and we would most likely have also missed later manifestations of language matches that would have highlighted stronger precedents (see the discussion in Section 2 above); and we would not have had to consider just language that was cited in our original argument."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have outlined a novel method for finding the origins of the precedent-setting legal language in amicus pleadings of the Supreme Court. We then follow this language from abstract to majority opinion to precedent and later court cases. Given the authors \"lack of legal experience, our findings should be viewed with some caution; however, we believe that our findings appear compelling enough to warrant further investigation. We believe that our findings strongly suggest that in certain cases, Amici has been able to define language that creates a federal precedent. Whether or not this is inherently problematic is a philosophical question; we believe that precedent by private interest groups in any case damages the public legitimacy of the institution of the Supreme Court (see [12]). Together with other arguments put forward in [1], we believe that our findings merit a review of the role of the\" Friends of the Court \"in the Supreme Court's review of Supreme Court practice."}], "references": [{"title": "The Trouble with Amicus", "author": ["Larsen", "Alli Orr"], "venue": "Facts (December", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Friends of the court: Examining the influence of amicus curiae participation in US Supreme Court litigation.", "author": ["Collins", "Paul M"], "venue": "Law & Society", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2004}, {"title": "The rise of conservative interest group litigation.", "author": ["O\u2019Connor", "Karen", "Lee Epstein"], "venue": "The Journal of Politics", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 1983}, {"title": "Quality Over Quantity: Amici Influence and Judicial Decision Making", "author": ["Box-Steffensmeier", "Janet M", "Dino P.
