Methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Dataset", "text": "We analyze users who comment on 413 public Facebook pages in the United States that support conflicting narratives - i.e. science and conspiracy - over a 5-year window (January 2010 to December 2014). Science pages aim to disseminate scientific knowledge and rational thinking, while conspiracy pages disseminate controversial information that is generally lacking in evidence and most often contradictory to official news. Such an investigation room is defined using the same approach as in [12, 6], with the support of various Facebook groups that are very active in monitoring conspiracy stories. On Facebook, there is something for positive feedback on the post, whereas a comment is the way in which users formulate their personality and collective online debates. Here, we consider a user embedded in science (conspiracy) when she is polarized toward science (conspiracy) - i.e. when and only when she has more than 95% of her total likes in posts that Science users have made available, or when we have analyzed at least 750 conspiracy pages, leaving at least 67 users to be trusted."}, {"heading": "2.2.

(...)"}, {"heading": "3.2. Personality and Echo Chambers", "text": "In a further step, we want to identify the dominant personality models (PM) within the echo chambers of science and conspiracy. Table 1 shows the ten most important personality models of users who support science and conspiracy. A personality model is characterized by five labels - one for each of the five major dimensions, i.e. extraversion, emotional stability, reliability, conscientiousness, openness - which indicate whether a user has a certain personality trait (\"y\") or an inverse (\"n\") or neither (\"o\"). For example, the personality model \"nyyoo\" shows users who are introverted, emotionally stable and consensual. Our results show that the dominant personality model in both echo chambers is \"nynny\" and shows the strong prevalence of individuals who enjoy interactions with close friends (low extraversion), are emotionally stable (high emotional stability), are suspicious and antagonistic to others."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusions", "text": "In online social media, users consume different information according to their preferences. Influenced by confirmation bias and selective exposure, they join virtual polarized communities where they reinforce their existing beliefs. In this post, we compare personality traits - i.e. extraversion, emotional stability, convenience, conscientiousness, and openness - of about 30K users embedded in different and contradictory echo chambers using a quantitative analysis of a massive dataset (more than 3M comments). Our results show that such personality traits are similarly distributed within polarized communities, with the exception of emotional stability, which is higher among users who support the conspiracy-like narrative. Furthermore, we find very similar and significant correlations between personality traits of users who support contradictory narrations. Furthermore, we show that the dominant personality model is equally distributed in both echo chambers. In particular, the most frequent advocates of science and low levels of affection (with low emotional inclination), others enjoy low emotional stability (with low inclination)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The author thanks Fabiana Zollo, Michela Del Vicario, Antonio Scala and Walter Quattrociocchi for valuable discussions.

appreciation for unusual ideas, imagination, and novel experiences [39].", "startOffset": 117, "endOffset": 121}], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "In online social networks, users tend to select information that adhere to their system of beliefs and to form polarized groups of like minded people. Polarization as well as its effects on online social interactions have been extensively investigated. Still, the relation between group formation and personality traits remains unclear. A better understanding of the cognitive and psychological determinants of online social dynamics might help to design more efficient communication strategies and to challenge the digital misinformation threat. In this work, we focus on users commenting posts published by US Facebook pages supporting scientific and conspiracy-like narratives, and we classify the personality traits of those users according to their online behavior. We show that different and conflicting communities are populated by users showing similar psychological profiles, and that the dominant personality model is the same in both scientific and conspiracy echo chambers. Moreover, we observe that the permanence within echo chambers slightly shapes users\u2019 psychological profiles. Our results suggest that the presence of specific personality traits in individuals lead to their considerable involvement in supporting narratives inside virtual echo chambers.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
