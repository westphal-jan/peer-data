Now, benefiting from the big data in cellular networks, it becomes possible to make the analyses one step further into the application level. In this paper, we firstly collect a significant amount of application-level traffic data from cellular network operators. Afterwards, with the aid of the traffic \"big data\", we make a comprehensive study over the modeling and prediction framework of cellular network traffic. Our results solidly demonstrate that there universally exist some traffic statistical modeling characteristics, including ALPHA-stable modeled property in the temporal domain and the sparsity in the spatial domain. Meanwhile, the results also demonstrate the distinctions originated from the uniqueness of different service types of applications. Furthermore, we propose a new traffic prediction framework to encompass and explore these aforementioned characteristics and then develop a dictionary learning-based alternating direction method to solve it. Besides, we validate the prediction accuracy improvement and the robustness of the proposed framework through extensive simulation results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 14:13:57 GMT  (170kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04778v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 03:52:23 GMT  (8109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04778v2", "Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications on March 26, 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["rongpeng li", "zhifeng zhao", "jianchao zheng", "chengli mei", "yueming cai", "honggang zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04778"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.04778.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Learning and Prediction of Application-level Traffic Data in Cellular Networks", "authors": ["Rongpeng Li", "Zhifeng Zhao", "Jianchao Zheng", "Yan Chen", "Chengli Mei", "Yueming Cai", "Honggang Zhang"], "emails": ["}@huawei.com).", "honggangzhang}@zju.edu.cn).", "longxingren.zjc.s@163.com,", "caiym@vip.sina.com).", "meichl@ctbri.com.cn)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is a way of putting oneself at the centre of the public's attention, benefiting from the large data networks on mobile networks.

Furthermore, this work shows traffic at the application level and shows the different properties between the different types of service.

In addition, \u03b1 \u2212 stable models lead to strong erratic results with properties of heavy tailed distributions and long-term dependence. Therefore, they arise naturally for the characterization of traffic in wired broadband networks [33], [34] and have been evaluated in resource management analyses [35], [36]. \u03b1 \u2011 stable models, with few exceptions, do not exhibit a closed expression of the probability density function (PDF) and are generally specified by their characteristic functions. Definition 1. A random variable T should obey stable models if there are parameters 0 < \u03b1-stable models; \u03b1-dependent operations 0, 0, 1 \u2264-scale function, so that their size-scale function depends on the following."}, {"heading": "B.

evaluation of the performance of telecommunications networks and attracts a lot of attention in wired broadband networks. Now, benefiting from the big data in cellular networks, it becomes possible to make the analyses one step further into the application level. In this paper, we firstly collect a significant amount of application-level traffic data from cellular network operators. Afterwards, with the aid of the traffic \u201cbig data\u201d, we make a comprehensive study over the modeling and prediction framework of cellular network traffic. Our results solidly demonstrate that there universally exist some traffic statistical modeling characteristics, including \u03b1-stable modeled property in the temporal domain and the sparsity in the spatial domain. Meanwhile, the results also demonstrate the distinctions originated from the uniqueness of different service types of applications. Furthermore, we propose a new traffic prediction framework to encompass and explore these aforementioned characteristics and then develop a dictionary learning-based alternating direction method to solve it. Besides, we validate the prediction accuracy improvement and the robustness of the proposed framework through extensive simulation results.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
