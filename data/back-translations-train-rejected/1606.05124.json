Existing BSP approaches typically assume data association is given and perfect, an assumption that can be harder to justify while operating, in the presence of localization uncertainty, in ambiguous and perceptually aliased environments. In contrast, our data association aware belief space planning (DA-BSP) approach explicitly reasons about DA within belief evolution, and as such can better accommodate these challenging real world scenarios. In particular, we show that due to perceptual aliasing, the posterior belief becomes a mixture of probability distribution functions, and design cost functions that measure the expected level of ambiguity and posterior uncertainty. Using these and standard costs (e.g.~control penalty, distance to goal) within the objective function, yields a general framework that reliably represents action impact, and in particular, capable of active disambiguation. Our approach is thus applicable to robust active perception and autonomous navigation in perceptually aliased environments. We demonstrate key aspects in basic and realistic simulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 10:22:04 GMT  (992kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05124v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.SY", "authors": ["shashank pathak", "antony thomas", "asaf feniger", "vadim indelman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05124"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.05124.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Robust Active Perception via Data-association aware Belief Space Planning", "authors": ["Shashank Pathak", "Vadim Indelman"], "emails": ["shashank@technion.ac.il", "antony.thomas@technion.ac.il", "asaff@technion.ac.il", "vadim.indelman@technion.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them are able to survive themselves without there being a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is in which there is a process in which there is a process in which"}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the solution to problems that have arisen in the past is not a solution, but a solution that is capable of bringing about a solution."}, {"heading": "1.2 Contributions", "text": "In summary, our main contributions in this Paper1 can be summarised as follows: (a) relaxation of the adoption of the data association is solved for a general data association-aware GNP framework (DA-GNP) with GMM priorities (b) consideration of the active data association aspect for both planning and conclusions, therefore providing a closed loop framework (c) reducing some of the known recent GNP approaches to degenerated cases of DA-GNP (d) that have empirical results to support two claims: data association is critical for a robust GNP, and the principle-based approach of DA-GNP can be scalable enough to be applied to practical problems."}, {"heading": "2 Notations and Problem Formulation", "text": "The robot records observations of various scenes and objects in the environment and uses these observations to infer application-dependent random variables of interest (e.g. past and current robot positions).However, the following three spaces are involved in the problem as illustrated in Figure 1: Pose space and observation space, which contain all possible perspectives a robot can take in relation to a particular environmental model and in the context of the task.

In practice, however, the majority of the weights will be negligible, and thus the remaining number of components of Mk + 1 in Eq can be denounced.

Standard cost functions in the literature typically include terms such as control usage cu, distance to the target cG and uncertainty c\u03a3, see e.g. [11,33]. In our case, however, the specific form of the latter should be reviewed and an additional term should be introduced that quantifies the level of ambiguity. In this section, therefore, we will briefly discuss these two terms, starting with the cost of posterior uncertainty. Since in our case, unlike ordinary GPs, the posterior belief is multimodal and presented as a mixture of Gaussians, all epiN (X-ik + 1), see Equation (23), we can define several different cost structures depending on how we treat the different modes."}, {"heading": "3.7 Formal Algorithm for DA-BSP", "text": "Considering a GMM belief b [Xk] and a candidate action UK, we first propagate the belief to obtain b [X \u2212 k + 1] and then simulate future observations {zk + 1} (line 2).

We evaluate our algorithm for conclusions (close) and active planning (see Table 2).

If the robot does not think about perception aliasing, it takes greedy measures (in terms of control costs and position uncertainty) and fails to be unambiguous, while DA-GNP successfully approaches planning with data association, as shown in Fig. 5b. Although not observed here, GNP cannot guarantee an optimal global solution (without control and uncertainty costs), and similarly DA-GNP cannot provide a global minimum cost path for a full definition - a problem known as NP-hard [10]."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "Such an assumption, however, is less appropriate in view of the uncertainty of localization, while it operates in ambiguous environments in which two scenes might look similar when viewed from appropriate viewpoints. In this work, we have developed a data association-conscious approach to faith planning (DA-BSP) that loosens the aforementioned assumption. Our framework rigorously takes into account aspects of data association within the BSP, taking into account various sources of uncertainty (uncertainty in robotic movement, perception and possibly in the observed environment). As such, it is able to better deal with ambiguous perceptual situations by appropriately calculating faith expansion and expected costs arising from candidate actions, and, in particular, using it for active disambiguity. Thanks to this connection inherent in planning, DA-BSP regards data association as parsimonious and a simple threshold for an explicit application of the data association-conscious faith planning as part of real planning."}], "references": [{"title": "Motion planning in non-gaussian belief spaces for mobile robots", "author": ["S.

data association (DA) within planning, while considering additional sources of uncertainty. Existing BSP approaches typically assume data association is given and perfect, an assumption that can be harder to justify while operating, in presence of localization uncertainty, in ambiguous and perceptually aliased environments. In contrast, our data association aware belief space planning (DA-BSP) approach explicitly reasons about DA within belief evolution, and as such can better accommodate these challenging real world scenarios. In particular, we show that due to perceptual aliasing, the posterior belief becomes a mixture of probability distribution functions, and design cost functions that measure the expected level of ambiguity and posterior uncertainty. Using these and standard costs (e.g. control penalty, distance to goal) within the objective function, yields a general framework that reliably represents action impact, and in particular, capable of active disambiguation. Our approach is thus applicable to robust active perception and autonomous navigation in perceptually aliased environments. We demonstrate key aspects in basic and realistic simulations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
