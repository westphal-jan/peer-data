[1] Focusing on conformity, that is, on a scenario in which the goal is to assess how a company's actual behavior relates to execution, is a fundamental notion of adherence to business principles in order to assess the quality of a process model and understand how it relates to the actual behavior of a company that provides the basis for the re-design, governance, and improvisation. [2] The use of event log is hard and potentially erroneously misrealized."}, {"heading": "2 Dealing with Incomplete Event Logs", "text": "To do this, we must first examine what incomplete event logs are (Section 2.1), and then understand how to adapt the notion of compliance to deal with partial data on the conduct of the process (Section 2.2), using a simple example described in this essay using the BPMN language.4 We will focus on structured process models in the sense of [6]. Generally, this is limited to the class of models that consist recursively of entry and exit blocks, in which each cleavage has a corresponding link that corresponds to its species, including pathological patterns that are notoriously difficult to characterize (e.g., nested OR contributions), with coverage covering a wide range of interesting use cases. 5 For clarity, we use BPMN, but our framework is linguistically inconsistent."}, {"heading": "2.1 Classifying Process Execution (In)Completeness", "text": "In fact, he says, he has found himself in a position to take the lead, in the way in which he is able to assert himself and in the way in which he is able to assert himself."}, {"heading": "2.2 Refining the Notion of Compliance", "text": "In our work, we look at prescriptive process models, i.e. models that describe the only acceptable designs, which correspond to the so-called \"de jure\" models in [5] and therefore require a definition of compliance to characterize the degree to which a given track corresponds / complies with the model. Traditional concepts of compliance are typically considered on the assumption that the track is a faithful footprint of reality and requires that the track is an end-to-end valid execution that can be fully reproduced on the process model. We call this notion of compliance strong compliance. Track (1) is an example of a track that is fully compliant with the POS process and requires that strict compliance is too restrictive when the track may be incomplete. In fact, incompleteness in a track impedes the possibility of reproducing compliance on the process model."}, {"heading": "3 Abduction and Incomplete Logs", "text": "Since the goal of this work is to provide automated procedures embedded in a tool that identifies conformant traces in the presence of incomplete event logs, given the prescriptive knowledge contained in a process model, we can schematize the entrance to our problem into three parts: (i) an instance-independent component, the process model described in this paper using BPMN; (ii) an instance-specific component, i.e., the (partial) protocol, and (iii) meta-information attached to the activities in the process model, indicating which are actually always, never, or possibly observable (i.e., logged) in the event log; and the third component is an extension of a typical business process specification that we propose (follow and extend the approach described in [9]) to provide prescriptive information about the (non) observability of activities."}, {"heading": "3.1 The SCIFF in short", "text": "??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}, {"heading": "3.2 Encoding Structured Processes and Their Executions in SCIFF", "text": "We want to illustrate how the various components of an (incomplete) event log and structured process activity are captured individually. (A log is a series of tracks, each of which is executed by a series of observed (atomic) events.) Thus, logging the execution of an observable activity in SCIFF is presented as an event, while the hypothesis of the execution of an unobservable activity is represented by a never-observable ABD (see Figure 3a). In the face of an event occurring in T, we use a function that represents the execution of an observable activity (a, T) = {H, T) when an observable activity is represented."}, {"heading": "3.3 Compliance in SCIFF: Declarative Semantics", "text": "We are prepared to provide a formal idea of compliance with the provisions in their various forms, such as is not necessary for our explanation. - We do this by extending the declarative semantics of SCIFF, which is provided in [7] to justify the incompleteness (i.e., the observability of the features). - The structured approach is indeed in accordance with a SCIFF specification S = < KB, A, IC >, where: (i) KB is a logical program [12] that contains the definition of accessory predicates; (ii) A = {ABD / 2}; (ii) IC is a set of ICs that defines the coding in Section 3.2. - A (execution) track and an abductive explanation follows as follows: A Trace T is a set of terms of type H (e, Ti) in which e is a term is described."}, {"heading": "3.4 Dealing with Process Execution (In)Completeness in SCIFF", "text": "We have already illustrated, using the POS example, how definition 4 can be used, on a very abstract level, to address compliance with a partial trace. In this section, we will illustrate in more detail how SCIFF can be used to resolve the three domains of incompleteness identified in Section 2.1.Trace and Event Incompleteness are treated by SCIFF in a uniform manner. In fact, the log / event incompleteness problem boils down to checking whether a given protocol (possibly endowed with incomplete traces / events) is compliant with a prescriptive process model. We consider entering the process model, along with information about the observability of its activities, a maximum length for completed tracks. Compliance is determined by the execution of the SCIFF evidence procedure and the evaluation of possible inductive responses. We proceed as follows: 1. We transform the process model with its observability, metainformation automatically missing in an IFF specification."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is not a purely formal decision, but a purely formal one."}, {"heading": "4.1 Discussion", "text": "The purpose of the experiment was to emphasize the algorithm in marginal cases. In fact, we note that on the one hand, we deliberately nested the model, in particular by adding a loop, which is a source of complexity, and on the other hand, we tested situations that are very unlikely in practice. Wecan certainly assumes that in typical scenarios, the number of (partial) observable activities, which in most cases are performed by humans, usually does not exceed half of the total activities (i.e.% AOA > 50%), and that from the% AOA parameter and the length of the partial track, a good estimate of the limit on the trace length can be made, thus avoiding useless loops (if any) iterations. In such settings, the performance of the seductive procedure is reasonable for the different types of incompleteness. For example, they are sufficient for keeping a few seconds, if at most a single event description is completely unknown, up to about 4.5 minutes, if 4 event descriptions are missing."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "The problem of incomplete traces has been addressed by a series of work in the field of process discovery and conformity, some of which [2,3] have addressed the problem of alignment of event logs and procedural / declarative process models [2,3]. Such work examines the search space of possible steps to align the protocol with the model. Our goal is not to manage generic aberrations between models and protocols, but to focus on a specific type of incompleteness: the model is correct and the protocol may be incomplete. We can divide existing work aimed at identifying possible model-conforming \"worlds\" from a series of observations into two groups: quantitative and qualitative approaches, the former relying on the availability of a probable model of execution and knowledge."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have presented an inductive framework to support the monitoring of business processes (and in particular compliance verification) by attacking the various forms of incompleteness that may be present in an event log. As for future development, the SCIFF framework is based on first-order logic, paving the way for (i) the inclusion of data [24], (ii) the extension of other types of workflows (e.g. timeframes as in [25]), and (iii) the exploration of probability models to deal with incomplete knowledge."}, {"heading": "18.
