Although names are strong gender indicators, the names of Twitter users are rarely used as a feature; probably due to the high number of ill-formed names, which cannot be found in any name dictionary. Instead of relying solely on a name database, we propose a novel name classifier. Our approach extracts characteristics from the user names and uses those in order to assign the names to a gender. This enables us to classify international first names as well as ill-formed names.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 10:24:29 GMT  (228kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05467v1", "9 pages (8 pages in actual proceedings), 2 figures, 8 tables, conference: MISNC, SI, DS '16, August 15 - 17, 2016, Union, NJ, USA"], ["v2", "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 12:38:04 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05467v2", "9 pages (8 pages in actual proceedings), 2 figures, 8 tables, conference: MISNC, SI, DS '16, August 15 - 17, 2016, Union, NJ, USA"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages (8 pages in actual proceedings), 2 figures, 8 tables, conference: MISNC, SI, DS '16, August 15 - 17, 2016, Union, NJ, USA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["juergen mueller", "gerd stumme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05467"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.05467.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Gender Inference using Statistical Name Characteristics in Twitter", "authors": ["Juergen Mueller", "Gerd Stumme"], "emails": ["mueller@cs.uni-kassel.de", "stumme@cs.uni-kassel.de", "permissions@acm.org."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "CCS Concepts \u2022 Information Systems \u2192 Information Extraction; Assessment of Access Results; Data Mining; \u2022 Human-Centered Computing \u2192 Social Networks; Keywords Gender Inference; Classification; Experimentation; Social Networks; Twitter"}, {"heading": "1.

Second, the nam dict dataset is the largest dataset we know that includes non-American names. Following is a brief description of both datasets: Census: The Census dataset was created in 1990 by the US Census Bureau and consists of three files, one for female first names, one for male first names, and one for all surnames.

Only 9,060 of the 12,681 users could be reached through the Twitter API to date. This breakdown is broken down into 3,471 male and 5,589 female users (according to AMT employees).

We used a grid search technique with a 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions to find the best parameter, which is \u03b3 = 0.1745521 and cost = 1 with an accuracy of 70.9% and a kappa value of 0.419. The standard method for assigning genders to names without classification would be by random guess.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Our first contribution was the suggestion of a novel name classifier - NamChar - that is able to identify a first name as one of the two genders by using only a small set of characteristics extracted from the written first name. We evaluated the performance of all possible name characteristics and selected the statistically significant characteristics. Our second contribution was the introduction of an improved Gender Consequence Classifier for Twitter users. We observed that only using a larger name database will not improve the performance of the Threshold Classifier. The best results were obtained from our NamChar Threshold Classifier. There are some topics that might be interesting for further investigation. It is surprising, for example, that users only used the Lovins text to calculate k-top stems and co-stems during feature calculation. The Porter stemmer [22] has since become a de facto standard and has largely replaced the Lovins."}, {"heading": "7.

Instead of relying solely on a name database, we propose a novel name classifier. Our approach extracts characteristics from the user names and uses those in order to assign the names to a gender.
