Different Aggregation Strategies", "text": "In this paper, we consider the resulting normalized degree of nodes according to their highest normalized degree or their normalized layer WA. \"For the aggregation of these multiple criteria, a single operator is increasingly used, representing the maximum weighting of different, possibly conflicting criteria [14]. He explained that the aggregation of multiple criteria in a decision-making problem can be scaled from a series of alternatives between two extreme cases of pure OR and pure AND. In pure OR, the maximum value among the criteria is the result of the aggregation, and in pure AND, the minimum value among the criteria is of interest. In the first case, this is a solution that meets at least one criterion, in the second case even the least satisfactory criteria must be high."}, {"heading": "III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "Figure 2.a presents the resulting rankings of two airports in the air transport networks (all four carriers) (78 layers each). (\u03b2 = \u03b2 = 78 layers) A curve for each normalization method (\u03b2 = 99 layers) is plotted against the selected \u03b2-value representing the aggregation strategy. Rankings are relative rankings of the 9 common nodes that exist in all four layers. However, keep in mind that a high \u03b2-value (high ORness = high ANDness) prefers nodes with a high minimum degree of centralization in at least one layer, a \u03b2-value of 0 (an ORness of 0.5) ranking points according to their average degree of centralization and a low \u03b2-value (high ORness = high ANDness) preferring nodes with the highest minimum degree of centralization. In relation to all four layers, Manchester Airport is an interesting case, as shown in Figure 2.a) Its actual grade in the four layers of the airlines is maximum (5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, and 5, respectively)."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "The intuitive examination of the centrality of nodes in this paper shows that even seemingly simple and insignificant modeling decisions, such as normalization and aggregation strategies, result in very different ranking positions of nodes in multiplex networks. Furthermore, the visual method presented in this paper allows to categorize nodes based on their sensitivity to different aggregation or normalization strategies, for both or for none. Furthermore, the small dataset of an airline network is the first promising example that leads to very interesting insights. The large dataset of a tweet network shows even more interesting cases that exhibit a very high sensitivity to the choice of both aggregation and normalization strategies. Another interesting case can be found in the medium-sized dataset of a law firm: it shows a high sensitivity to the choice of aggregation strategy. The experimental results underscore the need to relate all kinds of preliminary processing steps to analyzing the diversity resulting from it."}], "references": [{"title": "Betweenness centrality measures for directed graphs", "author": ["D.R.
