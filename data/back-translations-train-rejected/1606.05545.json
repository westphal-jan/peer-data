On the one hand, we exploit some of the main advantages of unsupervised algorithms: (1) the interpretability of their output, in contrast with most supervised models, which behave as a black box and (2) their robustness across different corpora and domains. On the other hand, by introducing the concept of compositional operations and exploiting syntactic information in the form of universal dependencies, we tackle one of their main drawbacks: their rigidity on data that are differently structured depending on the language. Experiments show an improvement both over existing unsupervised methods, and over state-of-the-art supervised models when evaluating outside their corpus of origin.

In the sentence \"He is not very handsome, but he has something I really like,\" people have the ability to conclude that the word \"very good,\" \"not\" the whole expression \"very handsome\" and \"but\" impairs the relevance of \"he is not very handsome\" and increases the word \"he has something I really like.\" On this basis, a person could justify a positive general mood to this sentence. Our most important contribution is the introduction of the first universal and unattended model for compositional sentiment analysis (SA), which is driven by syntax-1http: / / grupolys.org / software / UUUSA / based rules. We are introducing a formalism for compositional operations that allows the creation of arbitrarily complex rules for dealing with relevant phenomena for SA, for any language and syntactic dependency annation."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "The approach is limited by the curse of dimensionality, although collecting data from the target domain can help reduce this problem (Kiritchenko et al., 2014).

Each arc of the form (i, d, j) corresponds to a syntactic dependence between the words wi and wj; where i is the index of the header or parent, j is the index of the dependent or infantile word, and d is the dependency type representing the type of syntactical relationship between them. Following common practice, we use the node 0 as a dummy root node, which is the head of the syntactic root word (s) of the sentence i. We write i d \u2212 \u2192 j as an abbreviation for (i, d, chili) E, and we define the dependence on the k types if they are not relevant."}, {"heading": "3.2 Operations for compositional SA", "text": "The system will use a series of compositional operations to propagate changes to the semantic orientations of the nodes in the tree. Once all relevant operations have been performed, the SO of the sentence is stored as \u03c30, i.e., the semantic orientation of the root node.A compositional operation is triggered when a node in the tree corresponds to a given condition (related to the related PoS operations, dependency types and / or word forms); and it is applied to a perimeter of one or more nodes, which is calculated from a number of levels in the tree and then applies an application scope function. Formally, we define our operations as follows: Definition 2. Give a dependency tree T (V, E), a compositional operation is a tuple o = (prognostics, C, forecasting, forecasting, forecasting) that we are using a function."}, {"heading": "3.3 An algorithm for unsupervised SA", "text": "To perform the operations and calculate the SO of each node in the dependency structure of the sentence, priority i is set by executing the SO of each word with a subjective lexicon, as traditional, unattended approaches do (Turney, 2002). Some options for obtaining multilingual subjectivity lexicon are SentiStrength (subjective data for up to 34 languages) or the approach of Chen and Skiena (2014), which introduced a method of building senticons for 136 languages. Our implementation supports the lexicon format of SentiStrength, which can be inserted directly into the system. Furthermore, we offer the option of creating different dictionaries to avoid conflicts between homonymous words (e.g. \"I'm fine\" versus \"They gave me a fine\").Then we traverse the parse tree in poststoral application of algorithms to update setic orientations."}, {"heading": "4 NLP tools for universal unsupervised", "text": "The Gimpel et al. (2011) system serves as a starting point for performing state-of-the-art universal, unsupervised and syntactic sentiment analysis. Although it was originally intended for English tweets, we have found that it performs well in many other language families (Romance, Slavic, etc.) and rely on the free distribution of the Toutanova and Manning tags (2000) for part-time tagging. Dependency parsers are built with MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007) and MaltOptimizer (Ballesteros and Nivre, 2012). We have trained a number of taggers and parsers for different languages using the tag universal and dependency sets (Petrov et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2013). Table 1 shows their performance under standard metrics. Tagging3 and parsing4 models are also available."}, {"heading": "5 Defining compositional operations", "text": "In this section, we will show the definition of the most important rules we have used to evaluate our system.

We will use examples that follow these universal guidelines as they are available in more than 40 languages and, as shown in \u00a7 6, the same rules can be competitive in different languages."}, {"heading": "5.1 Intensification", "text": "Intensification amplifies or diminishes the sensation of a word or phrase. Simple cases of this phenomenon can be: \"I have huge problems\" or \"That's a bit disappointing.\" Traditional lexicon-based methods treat most of these cases with simple heuristics (e.g. amplifying or diminishing the sensation of the word after an amplifier), but ambiguous cases can occur where such lexical heuristics are not enough. For example, \"huge\" can be a subjective adjective that introduces its own SO (e.g. \"The house is huge\"), but also an amplifier when it modifies a subjective noun or adjective (e.g. \"I have huge problems\" in which it makes \"problems\" more negative). Universal compound operations overcome this problem without the need for any heuristics. A dependence tree already shows the behavior of a word within a sentence thanks to its dependence type, and the role it plays in language."}, {"heading": "5.1.1 \u2018But\u2019 clauses", "text": "Compositional operations can also be defined to deal with more difficult cases, such as clauses introduced by \"but,\" which are considered a special case of intensification by authors such as Brooke et al. (2009) or Vilares et al. (2015a). It is assumed that the main sentence associated with \"but\" loses its relevance to the reader (e.g. \"It is expensive, but I love it\"). Figure 3 shows our proposed compositional process for this clause, formally: (weighting \u03b2, w, w, but), as we must first process more intensively the local phenomena before solving adversatives that are larger in scope."}, {"heading": "5.2 Negation", "text": "Negation is one of the most difficult phenomena to deal with in South Africa, as its semantic scope cannot be local (e.g. \"I do not plan to make you suffer\").Existing unguarded lexical approaches are limited to looking at a section to guess the extent of the negation, so it is likely that they consider terms as part of the scope that should not be negated from a semantic point of view. Dependency types help us determine which nodes should act as negation and which should be their sphere of influence. To make it short, let's just illustrate some relevant negation cases and illuminating examples in Figure 4. Formally, the proposed compositional operation is to address most forms of negation under universal guidelines: (shift, w-negations, w-negations, t-U-d-neg, 1, 2, dest-lm-branchacomp, sub-jr), which represents the rare U tag."}, {"heading": "5.3 Irrealis", "text": "Irrealis refers to linguistic phenomena that are used to refer to non-factual actions, such as conditional, subjunctive, or desirable sentences (e.g., \"He would have died if he had not gone to the doctor\"). It is a very complex phenomenon to deal with, and systems are usually unable to address this problem, or they simply define rules to ignore sentences that contain a list of unreal stopwords (Taboada et al., 2011). In this study, we do not go into this phenomenon in detail, but only propose a rule that deals with \"if\" constructions (e.g., \"if I die [...]\" or \"if you are smart [...],\" considering that the phrase it contains should be ignored in the final calculation. Formally: (weighting, w, w, if), times, times, times, times, times, times, times, times, times, times, times, times, times, times, and times its graphical representation would be very similar to an illustration (1)."}, {"heading": "5.4 Discussion", "text": "Figure 5 provides an analysis of our introductory sentence \"It is not very handsome, but it has something I really like\" and shows how compositional operations accurately grasp semantic composition. It is difficult to measure the scope of our rules and the potential of these universal compositional operations, since it is possible to define operations of any complexity for any number of relevant linguistic phenomena. In this line, Poria et al. (2014) define a series of English sentic patterns to determine how feelings flow from concept to concept in a variety of situations (e.g. complementary relationships, direct nominal objects, relative sentences...) via a dependency tree according to the guidelines of De Marneffe and Manning (2008)."}, {"heading": "6 Experimental results", "text": "We compare our algorithm with existing approaches in three languages: English, Spanish and German. The availability of corpora and other unattended SA systems for English and Spanish allows us a richer comparison than in the case of German, where we only have an ad hoc corpus. We compare our algorithm with respect to two of the most popular and widely used unattended systems: (1) SO-CAL (Taboada et al., 2011), a language-dependent system available for English and Spanish, guided by lexical rules at the morphological level, and (2) SentiStrength, a multilingual system that does not use a PoS tagging or parsing step to perform multilingual analysis, and instead relies on a set of subjectivity lexics, snippet-based rules and the treatment of non-grammatical phenomena (e.g. writing replication), we also take into account the Spanish evaluation system developed for the corpus."}, {"heading": "6.1 Resources", "text": "For the evaluation, we selected the following standard English corporas: \u2022 Taboada and Grieve (2004) corpus: A general domain collection of 400 long reviews (200 positive, 200 negative) about hotels, movies, computer or music ua topics, extracted from epinions.com. \u2022 Pang and Lee (2004) corpus: A corpus of 2 000 long movie reviews (1 000 positive, 1 000 negative). \u2022 Pang and Lee (2005) corpus: A corpus of short movie reviews (sentences). Specifically, we used the test split used by Socher et al. (2013), removing the neutral as they did the neutral for the binary classification task (total: 1 821 subjective sentences). To demonstrate the universal capabilities of our system, we include a rating for Spanish presented by Brooke et al. (2009) (200 positive and 200 negative long reviews from ciao.es).For German, we rely on a data set of 2 000 positive reviews (1 000 positive and 1 Spanish sonica)."}, {"heading": "6.2 Comparison to unsupervised approaches", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of us are able to play by the rules they have given themselves, and that they are able to play by the rules they have given themselves."}, {"heading": "6.3 Comparison to supervised approaches", "text": "However, in real applications, a sufficiently large training corpus corresponding to the target texts in terms of genre, style, length, etc., is often not available; and the performance of the monitored systems has proved controversial on domain transfer applications (Aue and Gamon, 2005).Table 5 compares our universal uncontrolled system with Socher et al. (2013) to a number of companies: (1) the collection used in the evaluation of Socher et al., system (Pang and Lee, 2005), a corpus of the same domain, i.e., movies (Pang and Lee, 2004), and the Taboada and Grieve (2004) collection. Socher et al.'s system provides set polarity classification with five possible outputs: very positive, neutral, negative, very negative, very negative."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and future work", "text": "In this article, we have described, implemented and evaluated a novel model for universal and unattended sentiment analysis, driven by a set of syntactic rules for semantic composition. Existing unattended approaches are purely lexical, their rules are heavily dependent on the language in question, or they do not consider any kind of natural language processing steps to be able to handle different languages using shallow rules. To overcome these limitations, we introduce, from a theoretical and practical perspective, the concept of compositional operations to arbitrarily define complex semantic relationships between different nodes of a dependency tree. Universal parts of the language tagging and parse dependencies make it possible to create multilingual sentiment analyses of compositional operations that effectively deal with semantic compositions over natural language sentences. The system is not limited to any corpus or language, and can be adapted to any new definition or other."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "David Vilares is supported by the Ministeriode Educacio, Cultura y Deporte (FPU13 / 01180).
