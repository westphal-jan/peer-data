Motivation", "text": "Data-driven HR is the current trend in HR departments to replace the outdated notion of the support function and transform HR into a proactive consultant and educational partner within a business environment. Specifically, the \"talent war\" and the volume of job applications for vacancies lead to new dimensions in the processing of candidate profiles and the search for the best fit candidate. Recruiters and HR managers can easily biased or inadvertently apply \"filters\" 1 to candidates without having a full 360 degree view of a single candidate. In addition, the problem of assigning internal and external candidates when multiple profiles and positions need to be filled multiplies the efforts required. Candidates can easily flood recruitment inboxes via online1, e.g. just looking for a specific keyword or degree; and lack of domain knowledge for a position to fill channels. This is important because Erica Breuer says customized recruitment inboxes can easily flood over online1, so that candidates are actively seeking a specific keyword or degree; and lack of domain knowledge for a position to fill channels."}, {"heading": "2. From Document to Information", "text": "Most external job seekers 3 need to provide multiple documents to prove their education, employment entitlement, language certificates, formal training and a re-summary of what previous work experience, training, awards, skills and more indicate. We observed that most re \"sume\" s are provided as a pdf document and use their typical structured skills, because a simple text extraction (e.g. xpdf's pdf2text [3]) can cause job searches on online portals, such as linkedin, to focus largely on professionals3. External - outside an organization Xiv: 160 6.05 611v 2 [cs.C L] 21 Jun 20in mixed segments (see Figure 1), the use of layout information is crucial. To correctly identify all entities in a re \"sume,\" we employed segment-specific processors."}, {"heading": "3. From Information to Knowledge", "text": "The goal is to get a complete picture of the fit of a candidate for a particular position. Therefore, we need to combine several dimensions of information, such as skills, education and work experience. In this section, we will show how to measure the fit in each dimension and how to merge them to get a final ranking that represents the fit of a candidate."}, {"heading": "3.1. Scoring", "text": "In our prototype, each candidate is assigned a score between 0 and 100, which indicates their match with a given job description. The score is the weighted average of the three categories: education, work experience and skills. By default, the skills score is twice as important as the other two."}, {"heading": "3.2. Education", "text": "For the university rankings, we used: Times Higher Education [6] and QS [7], both of which contain a score between 0 and 100, with 100 being the top 5. We use the average of both scores. If a university is not included in one of these rankings, its score for that ranking is counted as 0. We know this may be unfair, but almost all the universities we reviewed for our prototype were represented in at least one of the rankings. By default, the score is a constant number: 20 (Bachelor), 35 (Master) or 50 (PhD student). The sum of the scores of the degree and university ranking results in the final score. Note that only the most recent university and recent degree are taken into account, rather than the previous one. One of the reasons is that certain school types, e.g. high schools, are not considered for college rankings that would result in a zero score."}, {"heading": "3.3. Work Experience", "text": "Our second value refers to work experience, which depends on the duration of employment as well as the employer's score. The younger the employment is, the more this employment contributes to the work experience score. To simplify it, each month of experience is worth one point. It is extremely difficult to classify employers. Not only because the data for each individual company out there (especially start-ups and SMEs) is lacking, but also because there is no single criterion to classify them. In addition, to how much a ranking criterion such as \"turnover\" or \"number of employees\" supports an individual's aptitude and level of experience, in order to have at least a certain level of employer quality in our ranking, we have relied on the previous selectivity of the employer in hiring. To evaluate the career progress of workers on the basis of their current employer, we do not have enough data to consider the entire career, we take the average educational value of its employees as the employer's score-weighted sum of the experience score."}, {"heading": "3.4. Skills", "text": "The skill score is the average value of all desired skills. In order to calculate a certain skill score, we match the skills with the skills of the candidate. For each skill skill, the distance (see section 2) to the desired skills is calculated and 5. For THE 100 means \"perfect\" and for QS 100 means \"first.\" The score for these skills is calculated as follows: score = scorematch \u2212 \u03b1 distance (1), whereas scorematch is a constant that reflects the score for exactly matching skills of the distance zero. Other skills are based on distance penalties, which are regulated by the \u03b1 parameter."}, {"heading": "4. Prototype Application", "text": "To learn about the potential of our application, we built a prototype that allows to filter, classify and compare candidates. In [8] we provided a screencast that shows all the important skills."}, {"heading": "4.1. Ranking Candidates", "text": "The candidates are assigned several points, as described in section 3.1, on the basis of which they are sorted according to the ranking in different visualizations (see section 4.3) of the candidates. Either a weighted overall ranking can be applied or a fine-grained, focused ranking based on individual skills, education or professional experience."}, {"heading": "4.2. Filtering Candidates", "text": "To filter candidates, there are 6 different options available to the user (see Figure 3). One option is to filter according to the required qualifications. Another option is to specify the minimum number of years of professional experience. Note that filtering does not affect scoring, it only helps to reduce the pool size of candidates. The user can also select any combination of skills to determine a desired candidate profile. Skills selection is supported by 6. Recruitment consultants or HR managers based on the large body of 800k profiles, as described in Section 2. Note, skills scoring and ranking are based on the random model of our training profiles. The advantage of this is that new skills appear and are mapped automatically as long as new qualification profiles are added. The disadvantage is that we may experience a slight delay in correctly assigning new skills, as some occurrences of these new skills are required. In addition, users can start adding job skills and even using related ones at any time."}, {"heading": "4.3. Comparing Candidates", "text": "4.3.1. Cards. The standard method of displaying candidates is the map view shown in Figure 4 A. Each candidate is represented by a map that includes the most important aspects such as name, score and most recent grade. Each card also has a chart that breaks down the score of candidates in the three categories (education, work experience and skills).The user can quickly see which category a candidate surpasses or falls behind. Generally speaking, the larger the triangle in the chart, the better the candidate's score is relative to all the other candidates. Conventional features such as book marking of candidates or direct contact options are also available.4.3.2. Points. A tabular view of the scores is shown in Figure 4 B. This view allows the user to quickly assess how a candidate matches specific skills. There is a column for each of the three main categories as well as all desired skills."}, {"heading": "4.4. Inspecting Candidates", "text": "One of the main features of the application is the analysis and explanation of the match between the candidate's qualification sets and the work profile requirements. On the profile page (see Figure 5), on the left, the original match is embedded, while the extracted information is grouped into maps on the right. 4.4.1. Context. Above an object of the extracted information cards, e.g. a skill, all occurrences of that skill are highlighted in the original match, giving the user the opportunity to easily check the context of that skill and learn more about it. Projects or classes have included this skill, for example, under 4.4.2. Related Skills - desired skill map. Not only does the desired skill map visualize the quality of the qualification profile skills, but each skill can also be expanded to show the best similar skills and degree of similarity. For example, Scilab is only a 90% match. As this skill is not explicitly mentioned in the job profile, i.e."}, {"heading": "5. Summary and next Steps", "text": "This research prototype demonstrates how to apply a data-driven approach with multiple data sources to guide a user in bringing together candidates and jobs. ML and NLP enable us to build a pipeline that first extracts all relevant information from newly accepted applicants and provides it in a structured way. In addition, once newly prepared applications are processed, external data for employers and educational institutions is also included to calculate candidate matches. Recruiters can tailor their search and filtering to specific job roles. In addition, there are multiple options and dimensions to compare candidates. Ultimately, the application allows detailed analysis of newly prepared evaluations to validate ranking and appropriate recommendations. However, since we have developed a prototype, there are potential next steps and areas for further improvement. First, weights for calculating evaluations are not yet optimized. Specifically, user research is necessary in order to evaluate different configurations, and to further focus on the most important areas of the work we are doing."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank the team of the SAP Innovation Center, Palo Alto: Frank Blechschmidt, Fredrick Chew, Pascal Crenzin, Stephan Haarmann, Michael Janke, Jaeyoon Jung, Roger Li, Bhumi Patel, Stefan Selent and Rene \u0301 Springer."}], "references": [{"title": "Don\u2019t just copy and paste: 4 things to put on LinkedIn but not your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, http://mashable.com/2016/03/27/ differences-linkedin-resume", "author": ["Erica Breuer"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2016}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 0, "context": "This is important, because according to Erica Breuer, tailored r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are still the most effective way to apply for a job [2].", "startOffset": 123, "endOffset": 126}], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Recruiters usually spend less than a minute looking at each r\u00e9sum\u00e9 when deciding whether it\u2019s worth continuing the recruitment process with the candidate.
