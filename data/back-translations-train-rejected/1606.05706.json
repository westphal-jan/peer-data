An isotonic Conditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) based sequential model is proposed to make predictions on sentence- or segment-level.

We evaluate our agreement and disagreement tagging model on two disparate online discussion corpora -- Wikipedia Talk pages and online debates. Our model is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in both datasets.

Our model inputs the text units x = {x1, \u00b7 \u00b7, xn} in the same sequence and outputs a sequence of sentiment labels y = {y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, yn}, with labels in O being strongly disagreed (NN), disagreed (N), neutral (O), agreed (P) and strongly agreed (PP). Furthermore, elements in the partial arrangement O exhibit a proper relationship \u2264. In this context, we differentiate agreement and disagreement with varying intensity, as the output of our classifier can be used for other applications, for example, the detection of disputes in which \"strongly disagreed\" (e.g. NN) plays an important role."}, {"heading": "3.2 Isotonic Conditional Random Fields", "text": "Conditional Random Fields (CRF) have been successfully applied in numerous sequential labeling tasks (Lafferty et al., 2001). Given a sequence of statements or segments x = {x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, xn}, the probability of labels y for x according to the linear chain CRF is given by the following factors: p (y | x) = 1Z (x) exp (p), p (yi, xi)))), p < \u03c3, \u03c4 > f < \u03c3, \u03c4 > (yi \u2212 1, yi), p, p, p, p, w > (yi, xi)), p, p, p, p, p, p, p > (yi \u2212 1, yi) and g <."}, {"heading": "3.3 Features", "text": "Characteristics with numerical values are first normalized by standardization, then divided into 5 categories.

Dependency relationships have proven effective for various tasks of emotion prediction (Joshi and PensteinRose, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Hassan et al., 2010; Abu-Jbara et al., 2012). We have two versions of the dependency relationship as characteristics, one being the original form, another gen-2The complete implementation is based on MALLET (McCallum, 2002).

In general, it takes as input a series of seed samples (e.g. sentiment words in our case) and the similarity between pairs of samples, which are then assigned values iteratively to the unlabeled samples (see algorithm 1). The construction of the diagram G is discussed in Section 4.1. Sentiment keywords in the new lexicon are listed in Table 2.Input: G = (V, E), wij words [0, 1], positive seed words P, negative seed words N, number of iterations T Output: {yi} | V-1 i = 0yi = 0yi = 1.0 \u2212 vii."}, {"heading": "4.1 Graph Construction", "text": "Traditional lexicographs like General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966) usually consist of polarized unigrams. As we mentioned in Section 1, uniigrams lack the ability to capture the mood conveyed in online discussions. Instead, bigrams, dependency relationships, and even punctuation can complement uniigrams. Therefore, we consider four types of text units as nodes in the diagram: unigrams, bigrams, dependency relationships, sentimental dependency relationships. Sensation dependency relationships are described in Section 3.3. We replace all relationship names with a generic label. Text units that appear in at least 10 discussions are retained as nodes to Noise.Edge Set E. As Velikovich et al. (2010) and Feng et al.

AAWD consists of 221 English Wikipedia Discussions with Agreement and Disagreement Notes.3The comment by AAWD is, of course, made at the statement or turn level, where a move is defined as a continuous body of text pronounced by the same participant. Annotators either mark each statement as consent, disagreement or neutrality, and select the appropriate text areas, or label the whole move. Each turn is commented on by two or three people. In order to create an expression-level label for instances that have only one deviation, we assume that they are labeled the same as the turn. To train our sentiment model, we transform matches and discord labels (i.e. 3-way) in the text as the inputs and expressions."}, {"heading": "5.2 Comparison", "text": "We compare two basic lines. (1) Base line (polarity) is based on counting the sentiment words from our lexicon. A statement or segment is predicted to match if it contains more positive words than negative words, or discord if more negative words are observed. (2) Base line (distance) is extended by (Hassan et al., 2010). Each sentiment word is associated with the nearest pronoun of the second person, and a surface distance can be calculated between them. The first is an RBF kernel SVM approach based on Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1999) (SVM), which is used for predicting sentiment (Hassan et al., 2010) and (dis) Conformity Detection (Yin et al., 2012) in online debates."}, {"heading": "6 Results", "text": "In this section, we will first show the experimental results for agreement at the sentence and segment level and for identifying disagreements in two types of online discussions - Wikipedia discussion pages and online debates. We will then provide a more detailed analysis of the features used in our model. In addition, we will discuss various types of errors made in the model."}, {"heading": "6.1 Wikipedia Talk Pages", "text": "For AAWD, we calculate two versions of the F1 values. Rigorous F1 values are calculated based on the actual values. For soft F1, a sentence if never flagged by a commentator at the sentence level and assumes its match / disagreement from the turn-level note is treated as truly positive when predicted to be neutral. Table 3 shows our most important results on the Wikipedia talk pages (AAWD data set). Without downsampling, our isotonic CRF-based systems with the new lexicon outperform the comparative approaches to detecting matches and discrepancies according to the Pairedt test (p < 0.05). We also perform downsampling by removing deviations that contain only neutral statements. However, it does not always help with performance. We suspect that the classifier is less likely to make neutral predictions in the training data, but to achieve slightly more mixed results, which in turn leads to slightly better results."}, {"heading": "6.2 Online Debates", "text": "Similarly, the F1 values for agreement, disagreement and neutrality for online debates (IAC dataset) are presented in Table 4. Our two isotonic CRF-based systems achieve significantly better F1 values than the comparison. Specifically, our system delivers the best results with the new lexicon. For SVM and linear chain CRF-based systems, we also add new sentiment characteristics constructed from the new lexicon, as described in Section 3.3. Wecan sees that these sentiment characteristics also increase performance for both compared approaches."}, {"heading": "6.3 Feature Evaluation", "text": "The results are listed in Table 5. As can be seen, performance improves incrementally with each new set of characteristics. We also use the \u03c72 test to highlight some of the prominent characteristics on the two sets of data. Table 6 shows that in online debates (IAC) some characteristics are highly thematic, such as \"the man\" or \"the scientist.\" This observation is consistent with the conclusion in Misra and Walker (2013) that characteristics with topic information are indicative for the detection of similarities and inconsistencies."}, {"heading": "6.4 Error Analysis", "text": "On closer inspection of the data, we found two types of errors: First, people express their disagreement not only through the use of idiosyncratic words, but also by providing contradictory examples. This requires a deeper understanding of the semantic information embedded in the text. Techniques such as textual entanglement can be used in the further work. Second, a sequence of sentences with sarcasm is difficult to recognize. For example, \"Bravo, my friends! Bravo! Goebbles would be proud of your ability to embellish information.\" We observe terms such as \"Bravo,\" \"friends,\" and \"be proud,\" which are indicators of positive feelings but have a sarcastic tone. We believe that a model capable of recognizing sarcasm would further improve performance."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We present an isotonic CRF-based match and disagreement detection model that delivers labels at the sentence or segment level. We bootstrap the construction of a sentiment lexicon for online discussion and code it into domain knowledge for the isotonic CRF learner. Our sentiment tagging model has been proven to outperform current approaches both on Wikipedia talk pages and in online debates.
