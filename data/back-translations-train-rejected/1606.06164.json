In this essay, we examine the use of negations in the image description. A negation is a word that conveys that something is not the case. Negations are often used when there is a discrepancy between what the speakers expect and what is actually the case (see e.g. Leech, 1983; Beukeboom et al., 2010). For example, if Queen Elizabeth of England wears negations in public, instead of a dress, (1a) would be acceptable because she is known to wear a dress."}, {"heading": "2 Data", "text": "We focus on denials of the Flickr30K dataset (Young et al., 2014), which were detected by lexical string matching using regular expressions, with the exception of verbs. For the verbs, we checked whether one of the tokens starts with a defect, omitted, misses or fails. Our search yielded 896 sentences, of which 892 are unique and 31 are false positives. Table 1 shows the frequency for each negative term. We performed the same analysis for the Microsoft COCO dataset (Chen et al., 2015) to see if the percentage of denials is constant. Our approach yielded 3339 sentences on2We provide all of our codes, data and annotation policies online.

Our categorization is the result of manually reviewing all the data twice: the first time to develop a taxonomy, and the second time to apply this taxonomy to all 892 sentences. Note that our categorization is meant as a practical guide to be used for generating natural language. There is already a unifying explanation for why people use negations (unexpected absence, see (Leech, 1983; Beukeboom et al., 2010). The question is how people use negations, what they negate, and what kind of knowledge is needed to produce these negations. The first use of negation is to indicate that something is missing: (2) a man without a shirt, the tennis. A woman graduating without a cap, without a cap. Shirts and shoes are most often absent in patches called the 30K."}, {"heading": "4 Annotating the Flickr30K corpus", "text": "Two of the authors commented on the Flickr30K corpus based on the categories listed above with two objectives: validating the categories and developing annotation guidelines for future work. By going through all the sentences of negations, we were able to identify borderline cases that could serve as examples for the final guidelines. Using the categories defined in Section 3, we achieved agreement between the commenters of Cohen's \"0.67\" with a 77% agreement. In addition to our categorization, we found 39 examples where negations are also used to provide contrasts (in addition to their use in relation to the above categories). Two examples show: (13) a. A man shaves his neck, but not his beard. A man in a penguin with a penis with two penguins does not lead to a negation (two examples of negations)."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "The negations used by crowdworkers would probably have required some form of \"world knowledge.\" We are now discussing potential sources for identifying a candidate for negation in the description of an image (Valenti et al., 2012). In addition, we also need to understand the differences between the scene types, both from a computational (Oliva and Torralba, 2001) and a human perspective (Torralba et al., 2006). (b) The prominent absence category provides evidence for two types of expectations that play a role in the use of negations: general expectations (people should wear shirts, cf. 2a) and situation-specific expectations (students at graduation ceremonies typically wear hats, cf. 2b). (c) The negation of the action / behavior category requires action recognition, which is a challenging problem in still images (Poppe, 2010). The ability to automatically recognize this knowledge would help people make an image similar to 2009 (if they were contradictory)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We investigated the use of denials in the Flickr30K dataset. The use of denials implies that the descriptions contain a combination of objective and subjective interpretations of the images. However, denials are only a kind of subjective language in image description datasets. We expect that different subjective language usages (e.g. more discourse marker as before or though) can be observed relatively easily in this and other datasets. Furthermore, it would be interesting to investigate the use of denials in different languages, such as the German-English Multi30K dataset (Elliott et al., 2016). We encourage further research to discover other types of subjective language in visual and language datasets and to investigate how subjective language can influence language generation."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgments", "text": "EM and RM are supported by the Dutch Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Spinoza Prize awarded to Piek Vossen (SPI 30-673, 2014-2019).
