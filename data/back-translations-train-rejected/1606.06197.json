An interpreter adds \"feeling,\" expression, articulation, phrasing or swing. If we describe the composer as the sender, the musical interpreter as the transmitter and the recipient as the recipient, a lack of expressiveness arises when the interpreter is absent. A composition based on simple, common notation, which is played rigidly and mechanically just like written notes. The aim of the current work is to model the artistic expression and cognitive processes of a human musician in order to obtain a living interpretation through the computer. A second goal is to gain a deeper knowledge of polyrhythmic music and timing structures."}, {"heading": "1.1 Music Analysis", "text": "The rhythmic analysis approach is based on an adapted model of David Temperley's Preference System for Cognition of Fundamental Musical Structures [Temperl01]. In addition to the Temperley model, which derives a global meter, this approach identifies local polymetric structures for each rhythmic instrument in a musical ensemble, which can be the result of temporary ternary sequences in a global double meter (three over two) or binary sequences in a ternary meter (two over three)."}, {"heading": "1.2 Micro Timing", "text": "While the bars of the metric structure are isochrome, the bar divisions are not. In jazz, variations of the bar and the corresponding rhythmic feeling are referred to as swing. Consecutive eights are listed as long-short patterns. Butterfield [Butterf11] states that the swing also includes different degrees of velocity to create a vital drive, kinetic energy and sense of forward impulse by \"pulling against the pulse.\" Pulses were considered isochronic time intervals to represent a time frame at the lowest (or subdividing) level of the meter. Polak notes, however, that non-isochronic subdivisions of the bar in relation to stable clock patterns are fundamental to a metric system [Polak10]."}, {"heading": "2 Micro Timing", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Timing patterns as rhymic feels", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "2.2 Timing Measurements", "text": "To confirm the hypothesis that the micro-timing could be an overlapping binary / ternary swing, I focused on the analysis of polymetric West African percussion music of the Malinke from Guinea and the southern regions of Mali, in particular recorded djemb\u00e9 performances by drummer Billy Nankouma Konat\u00e9 and his father Famoudou Konat\u00e9. 900 bars were measured, and the empirically observed timing structures were determined by measuring time spans between the intervals of successive drum beats. Measurements of each bar were normalized to a reference duration of one bar to compare timing patterns at different tempi."}, {"heading": "2.3 Timing Model", "text": "The optimal values for the parameters are calculated by minimizing the sum of the quadratic errors of the model. The prediction of the model is compared with the confidence intervals of the measurements. [1] However, Famoudou Konat\u00e9 is the first single player of Les Ballets Africains de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e. Recordings were recorded with a Zoom H4 mobile recorder in Guinea and at workshops in Germany. [2] The ternary part was a sequence of tone, slap (TSS); the binary part was TTSS. An isochronous division divides the beat into a downbeat and an offbeat with a ratio of 1: 1. If a beat is considered as a reference, we get the normalized pulse lengths (0.5, 0.5), where the unit of both time intervals is \"normalized.\""}, {"heading": "3 Structural analysis of rhythmic patterns", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Metric Structure", "text": "In fact, it is like being able to hide without being able to play by the rules.

Here, a simple approach is used to group sound events: (Gap Rule) According to Tenney et al. [Tenney80], we prefer gaps as phrase boundaries (closure) when the gap is greater than the gaps on both sides, especially those where the ratio of the gap to the previous one is greater. In addition, the following rule of preference is given: (Signature Rule) We prefer phrases where local metric structures are modulated. This means that there is a tendency to group sound events that are located within the same local meter."}, {"heading": "4 Musical interpretation based on the recognized musical structure", "text": "The musical performance of the drum computer is based on the derived metric structure and the derived phrase structure. Therefore, a list of good interpretations (high score according to the preference rules) is considered. As the rhythmic sequence is played, the currently selected interpretation is switched from time to time to create a lively interpretation. Also, the swing parameters are slightly varied in a smooth, continuous manner. According to the results of the timing measurements presented in this paper, the amount of binary swing for sequences is increased.
