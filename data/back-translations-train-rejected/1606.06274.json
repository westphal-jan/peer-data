Current unsupervised approaches utilize features from grammar structures, to induce semantic roles. The dependence on these grammars, however, makes it difficult to adapt to noisy and new languages. In this paper we develop a data-driven approach to identifying semantic roles, the approach is entirely unsupervised up to the point where rules need to be learned to identify the position the semantic role occurs. Specifically we develop a modified-ADIOS algorithm based on ADIOS Solan et al. (2005) to learn grammar structures, and use these grammar structures to learn the rules for identifying the semantic roles based on the context in which the grammar structures appeared. The results obtained are comparable with the current state-of-art models that are inherently dependent on human annotated data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 19:53:53 GMT  (308kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06274v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vivek datla", "david lin", "max louwerse", "abhinav vishnu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06274"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.06274.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Data-Driven Approach for Semantic Role Labeling from Induced Grammar Structures in Language", "authors": ["Vivek Datla", "David Lin", "Max Louwerse", "Abhinav Vishnu"], "emails": ["vivek.datla@philips.com,", "davidlin@baylor.edu,", "maxlouwerse@tilburg.edu,", "abhinav.vishnu@pnnl.gov"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Dre eeisrVnlrrsrteeaeeeteeteerteerteerrrrrrrrrrrteeeeaeteeteeteerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}, {"heading": "Data-driving SRL procedure", "text": "rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide nlrtee\u00fceaeVrlrrlrrrrteeeee\u00fce, nlrVo eid rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide nlrteeeeeeeaeVrlrrrrrrrlrrrrf\u00fc ide nlrrrrrrrrrrf\u00fc ide nlrf\u00fc ide nlrrrf\u00fc ide nlrrrrrrrf\u00fc ide nlrrrf\u00fc ide nlrrrrrf\u00fc ide nlrrrrrrrrrrrf\u00fc ide nlrrrrrrrrf\u00fc ide nlrrrrrrrrrf\u00fc ide nlrrrrrrrrrrf\u00fc iuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrllllrrrrrrrrrrrrrrlllllllrrrrrrrrrrrrrllllllrrrrrrrrrrrlllllllrrrrrrrrrlllllrrrrrrrrrrllllrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrlllllllllrrrrrrrrllllllrrrrrrlllllllllllllllrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrlllllllllllllllllrrrrrrr"}, {"heading": "Semantic role labeling", "text": "The semantic role we perform as a task is to learn from a corpus of sentences commented on with semantic roles. < < / \"We treat each sentence as a single entity (as semantic roles that refer to terms from a sentence). We first analyze each sentence by learning the hierarchical structural rules from the m-ADIOS algorithm. After analyzing the sentences, we search for patterns and collect contextual information around them. This information is used as characteristics for a classifier that supports learning and labeling of each sentence. Data: Propbank We illustrate this process by using PropBank Kingsbury and Palmer (2002) as our corpus. PropBank annotated text from Penn Treebank and Wall Street Journal Corpus is used. PropBank is based on predicates in the majority of cases they are verbal. Each predicate has a set of arguments that we associate (from ARG0 to ARG5)."}, {"heading": "Summary of Dataset Creation", "text": "To test the performance of m-ADIOS in the generating structure that encodes semantic roles, we use sentences in PropBank and analyzed sentences obtained after parsing sentences with rules we learned from the language. Let's take a close look at the example: The sentence \"john fedexed his package to his mother\" is analyzed based on the rules generated from the PropBank corpus. After parsing, we get a tree-like structure that is represented by a bracket scheme. Figure 5 shows the tree representation of the same bracket scheme. Figure 6 represents the structure with the Stanford parser. We can observe that patterns take the role of the \"head,\" similar to that of the noun phrase (\"NP\"), the verb phrase (\"VP\"), etc. Patterns have learned from the grammar rules that we do not have correct phrase boundaries in contrast to the strict adherence to phrase boundaries in traditional parsers."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Based on the 7 characteristics shown in Table 3, and the class designation given to each instance of patterns following the section, we have performed a 10-fold cross-validation classification using Bayes, Naive Bayes and Random Forest models. We report on all results with the measurements precision P = No. of the correct components identified Toal No. of the components identified. Table 4 shows the classification results relatively high, as the chance of finding the correct tag is only 0.125. Classification is done with a large amount of confidence as well as the interrater reliability with Cohens. Table 4 shows the classification results. Accuracy is relatively high given that the probability of finding the correct tag is only 0.125. Classification is done with a high degree of reliability. (k > 0.6) These can be attributed to the scarcity in the patterns attributed to the patterns obtained from the language."}, {"heading": "Future Work", "text": "Because of the strict generalization in our model, patterns that overlap greatly in their context can be called equivalent. After learning the rules, we convert them into grammar rules and analyze the sentences from which we have learned the rules. Theoretically, these rules can be extended to all other sentences that have the same words. In practice, however, this becomes a major disadvantage, since we have the problem of scarcity simply because many words can occur in different contexts and the order in which they appear makes a big difference in the formation of patterns. To overcome this problem, we plan to apply the method used by Datla, Lin and Louwerse (2014) to create apparent disadvantages of the language and to learn structures based on the inducing parts of the language."}], "references": [{"title": "Unsupervised argument identification for semantic role labeling", "author": ["O.
