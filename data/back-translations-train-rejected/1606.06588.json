SETUP", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Comparison of Tactile Sensors", "text": "For all our experiments, we used one of two tactile sensors designed for robotic hand use - BioTac and the fingertip sensor of the iCub robot (hereinafter incorrectly referred to as iCub). However, there are some significant differences between the innards and the functioning of these two sensors, which we will discuss in more detail below. BioTac sensor is structurally composed of a rigid core surrounded by an elastic skin filled with a conductive fluid. On the other hand, iCub has a solid internal support covered by a flexible PCB [9]. The PCB is surrounded by a conductive silicone foil that forms the second terminal of the sensor. Due to the elastic nature of the shell, coupled with a liquid interface between skin and core, BioTac can mimic the softness of the human finger."}, {"heading": "B. Hardware", "text": "We carried out experiments with a parallel manipulator with three joints and three degrees of freedom (Fig. 3). A linear motor acts as the end effector for the parallel manipulator, moving along the z-axis perpendicular to the common surface of the manipulator and the force-torque sensor. The force-torque sensor used is a Nano-17 from ATI Industrial Automation. The curvature caps of 1Taxel are a touch version of the pixel, which is understood as a tactile element. 2See http: / / robot-systems.com /.different radii can be attached to the FTS, which is also mounted on the common surface. Brackets are designed to attach the sensors to the end effector in such a way that the touch point remains the same for both BioTac and iCub."}, {"heading": "C. Electronic Circuitry", "text": "The linear motor is connected to the embedded system via a serial RS232 interface, and the force-torque sensor delivers analog data to the Teensy microcontroller, where it is then converted into SPI signals via the built-in A / D converter. BioTac is connected directly to the system via SPI, but the iCub protocol is converted from InterIntegrated Circuits (I2C) to SPI."}, {"heading": "D. Software", "text": "The force exerted by the linear motor on the sensors is controlled by a low-pass filtered signal from the force sensor, which is filtered to prevent vibrations during force control, and the force recorded for machine learning is the unfiltered force data."}, {"heading": "E. Data Acquisition", "text": "We gathered data for two different tasks, a regression task and a classification task. In the first task, the force in the vertical direction is to be estimated based on the raw taxel reactions. In this experiment, the tactile sensor touches a flat surface. This differs from the classification tasks, in which we let the tactile sensors touch one of five curved surfaces (see Fig. 4). In all experiments, the force applied to the tactile sensors is gradually increased from 0-5 N to the recording of 5000 samples, resulting in a period of approximately 60 seconds. Each experiment was performed three times to obtain three different data sets for training, validation and testing of our models."}, {"heading": "III. ESTIMATION AND RECOGNITION", "text": "In all cases, a minimal but necessary degree of pre-processing was used for both force estimation and curvature detection, and the first 600 samples were discarded because they had only initialized the build-up. We also performed a simple form of outlier removal: if any of the force or taxel responses violated a \"three sigma rule,\" the sample was discarded by adjusting a Gaussian distribution to a single channel and checking whether the difference to the mean exceeded three standard deviations. Furthermore, we found it beneficial to apply a ZScore transformation individually to each of the sets: each of the training, validation and test sets was divided by its standard tax deviation after subtracting its fiscal significance [8]."}, {"heading": "A. Force Estimation", "text": "Preliminary experiments showed that little was gained by using complex nonlinear models, such as random forests or neural networks, via simple linear regression; we also attribute this to the relative simplicity of the task due to the small deviations in the data; the only methodological improvement over a simple linear model was the use of a sparse linear model, i.e. lasso (see [7] for a good introductory text); we attribute this to its lower sensitivity to drift, since the drift of the taxa is not taken over by many, but only by a few sensors; and to achieve greater robustness, we implemented a window-based mean filter by using sensor measurements from the time step t \u2212 k to t to predict the t'th force value; the only hyperparameters based on the validation theorem and k were matched to the validation value and found in both models."}, {"heading": "B. Curvature Recognition", "text": "The choice of the model was therefore mainly driven by its ease of use and reproducibility, as well as the ability to model nonlinear decision boundaries. An F1 score of 0.79512 was achieved for the iCub. BioTac achieved an F1 score of 0.60488. Note that random rate leads to an F1 score of 0.2. We show the confusion in validation and testing in Fig. 7. The perfect prediction would show a clear diagonal line in the confusion matrix."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "It is obvious that the iCub finger sensor, which is relatively stiff and measures on the surface, encodes the curvature globally and the force locally. BioTac, which is soft and measures \"on the bone,\" does exactly the opposite by encoding the force globally and entangling the curvatures at low force. Although these results are not unexpected in retrospect, we provided experimental evidence. Above all, we see this as a springboard for future assessments of such hardware: the space of tasks and sensors still needs to be covered. The tasks considered are remarkably simple and not necessarily representative of the tasks a tactile sensor would be subjected to. For example, we need to perform similar tests with different force profiles, more diverse surfaces and more tactile sensors."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "Part of this work was supported by the TACMAN project, EC Grant Agreement 610967, within the FP7 Framework Programme."}], "references": [{"title": "Slowly adapting mechanoreceptors in the borders of the human fingernail encode fingertip forces", "author": ["I.
