INTRODUCTIONComplex signals and high-dimensional datasets developed from a variety of fields of science, as physics, engineering, genetics, molecular biology and many others, can be natural modelling as values on the edges of weighted graphs [1], [2].

Graph Signal Processing", "text": "Consider a diagram G = (V, E, W) of N nodes and E edges, where V indicates the quantity of nodes and E. The weight function W: V \u00b7 V \u2192 R reflects the extent to which two nodes are related to each other. WG is the weight matrix associated with this function. The combinatorial laplac LG = DG \u2212 WG, which is associated with the diagram G, is always symmetrically positively semi-defined, therefore it is characterized by a complete set of oral eigenvectors [11] based on the spectral theorem. We call it UG (n,) = u (n). Therefore, the laplac matrix can be decomposed as LG = UG\u041aGU \u0445 G, with a set of ormal eigenvectors [11]. Let us let x: V \u2192 R be a diagram signal defined on the diagram node whose value is the n-component of the signal \u0445n (n)."}, {"heading": "III. TIME-VERTEX REPRESENTATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Definition", "text": "The signals evolve over time via the N vertices of graph G. We refer to the cartesian product between time and graph 2 as the time-vertex domain and the X vertex signal. The time-vertex domain can be interpreted as a cartesian product between the generic graph G = (V, E, W) with laplac LG and the ring graph GT (assuming periodic boundary conditions in time) with laplac LT. The common LT is (LT \u00b7 LG) x = LGX + XLT (1), whereby the second term is obtained using the property of the Kronecker product (M1 M2) x = M2XM 1. In Equation (1), the laplac LT represents the discrete second order derived in terms of time: [XLT] (n, t + 1) \u2212 2T (n, n \u00b7 K, T \u00b7 T (T), T \u00b7 K (T \u00b7 T), T \u00b7 T (T \u00b7 K) (T), T \u00b7 K (T) (T \u00b7 K)."}, {"heading": "B. Joint Time-Vertex Fourier Transform", "text": "Since the time-vertex representation is derived from the Cartesian product of the two original domains, the common time-vertex-Fourier transformation (JFT) is obtained by applying the GFT to the graph dimension and the DFT along the time dimension [13]: X: X: (, k) = 1: TN: n: 1T \u2212 1: t = 0X: (n: t) u: (n) e \u2212 j\u03c9k t T, which can be conveniently rewritten in matrix form as follows: X: X: JFT (X) = U: GXUT. (3) The spectral domain helps define the function localization on the graph as in [8]."}, {"heading": "IV. DYNAMIC GRAPH WAVELETS", "text": "The DGW differ from the classical wavelengths in that they are not extended versions of an original mother wavelength. In fact, they propagate functions on the graph that evolve over time according to a PDE. We will use the common representation of the signal to characterize spectral relationships between the two domains and solve the PDE in the spectral range to obtain a useful tool for analyzing time-vertex signals that evolve according to this dynamic process. Finally, we will use the nucleus to form the set of DGW. Due to the lack of translation invariance of the graph, the nucleus will always operate in the graph spectral range and be located on the graph by means of the localization operator as in [8]. On the contrary, the time dependence can be defined either in the spectral or in the time range. In this contribution, we will use the time domain for convenience."}, {"heading": "A. Heat diffusion on graph", "text": "Let us first give a basic example of our model: The diffusion of heat on a graph can be considered a simple dynamic process over a network. It is described by the following (discretized) differential equation: X (n, t) \u2212 X (n, t \u2212 1) = \u2212 sLGX, (4) with initial distributionX (i, 0) = preservation (i). The solution of the closed form is given by X = e \u2212 stLG\u0443. Therefore, the heat diffusion core is isK (sLGX, t) = e \u2212 s\u043a\u0430t (5), where the parameter s is thermal diffusivity in classical heat diffusion problems and can be interpreted as a scale parameter for multi-scale dynamic graph wave analysis [9]. This equation models the spread of a function on the graph over time. However, in the present work we want to focus on a dispersion process, moving away from a starting point over time."}, {"heading": "B. The wave equation on graphs", "text": "In order to model functions that develop on a graph, we mainly use the PDE, which is associated with the wave equation. Here, the wave equation is defined on the graph and differs as such from the standard equation. This partial differential equation relates the derivative of second order in time to the spatial Laplat operator of a function: (LT IG) x = \u2212 \u03b12 (IT LG) x XLT = \u2212 \u03b12LGX (6), where \u03b1 is the propagation velocity parameter. If one assumes a vanishing initial velocity, i.e. the first derivative in the time of the initial distribution equation yields zero, the solution of this PDE can be written with the function calculus as [14]: X (\u00b7, t) = K (sLG, t) = Kt (7), where the equation in the initial distribution equation (n) = X (0) and Kt, s = K, is the equation of numbers."}, {"heading": "C. General definition", "text": "In the following, we will generalize the DGW on the basis of any time apex nucleus. The goal is to design a transformation that will help in the detection of a class of dynamic events on graphs based on an initial common distribution \u03a6m, \u03c4 (n, t) = [\u0418m'\u03c6] (n, t) located around the apex m and time \u03c4. The general expression of the DGW Wm, \u03c4, s at the time t and at the apex n can be written as follows: Wm, \u03c4, s (n, t) = [Kt, s\u03a6m, \u0432] (n, t), \u0432 t \u2265 0 (11), where, as before, Kt, s = K (sLG, t) is the matrix function K applied to the scaled laplac sLG and parameterized by time t. Depending on the dynamic graph nucleus, the DGW of a wave solution can mix the wave process, a diffusion or a dynamic process."}, {"heading": "D. Causal Damped Wave Dynamic Graph Kernel", "text": "We define the DGW as the solutions of Equation (6) for different \u03b1 = \u221a s. In addition, we need two additional properties. First, we want the shaft to be causal, i.e. to have a starting point in time. Second, the wave propagation in many applications is influenced by attenuation over time. Therefore, we introduce a damping term. DGW, which is defined in the graph spectral range, is defined as W is (\u03bb, t) = H (t) e \u2212 \u03b2t cos (t-arcs (1 \u2212 s2)), (12) where H (t) is the heaviside function and e \u2212 \u03b2t is the dampled decreasing exponential function in time. Secondly, the damping term has two remarkable effects. First, it reduces the importance of the selected boundary conditions in time (e.g. periodic or reflective), since the shaft disappears before it touches it. Secondly, it favours the construction of a frame of DW that we see is involved in: the lower boundary of DW."}, {"heading": "E.

We consider various seismic events whose epicenters have been located in different areas of New Zealand 1. Each waveform consists of 300 seconds that are sampled at 100 Hz, starting a few seconds before the seismic event. Seismic waveforms can be modeled as oscillating attenuated waves.
