Linguistic resources are invaluable because they capture generalizations from domain experts. However, resource construction is expensive, so it is not always possible to find an existing resource that captures exactly the set of optimal lexical properties for a downstream task. Resources that capture more coarse-grained, general properties can be used instead, e.g. WordNet for semantic evaluation (Fellbaum, 1998) or Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993, PTB) for syntactical evaluation. Since these properties do not exactly match the task, the intrinsic evaluation tests for a necessary (but possibly insufficient) set of generalizations (Pellbaum, 1998) or Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993, PTB) for syntactical evaluation of panners can be used."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "In fact, it is as if it were a way in which people in individual countries, in the EU, in the EU, in the EU, in the EU, in the EU, in the EU, in the EU, in the EU, in the EU, in the USA, in the USA, in the EU, in the EU, in the USA, in the USA, in the EU, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the EU, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the United Kingdom, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the United Kingdom, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the"}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced QVEC-CCA - an approach to intrinsic evaluation of word embedding. We have also shown that both QVEC and QVEC-CCA are not limited to semantic evaluation, but are general approaches to evaluate word vector contents in terms of desired linguistic properties. Semantic and syntactic linguistic characteristics that we use to construct linguistic dimension matrices are rather crude, so the proposed evaluation may approximate a number of downstream tasks, but may not be sufficient to evaluate fine-grained characteristics. In future work, we propose to find existing semantic, syntactic, morphological and typological resources (e.g. universal dependencies Treebank (Agic \u0301 et al., 2015) and WALS (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013), as well as multilingual resources (e.g. Danish Supersenses (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2015) to make better use of additional matececececal resources."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the National Science Foundation with the IIS-1526745 Award.
