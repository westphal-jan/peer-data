In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. In particular, we introduce methodology that not only quantifies these divergences, but also reveals whether they are from widespread discussion or a few popular retweets within these groups. We find that #BlackLivesMatter exhibits many informationally rich conversations, while those within #AllLivesMatter are more muted and susceptible to hijacking. We also show that the discussion within #BlackLivesMatter is more likely to center around the deaths of Black Americans, while that of #AllLivesMatter is more likely to sympathize with the lives of police officers and express politically conservative views.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 05:23:01 GMT  (938kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06820v1", "24 pages, 29 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 15:52:06 GMT  (938kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06820v2", "24 pages, 29 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 28 Jul 2016 17:28:11 GMT  (937kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06820v3", "24 pages, 29 figures"], ["v4", "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 02:41:31 GMT  (753kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06820v4", "25 pages, 28 figures"], ["v5", "Sat, 20 May 2017 03:36:05 GMT  (750kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06820v5", "26 pages, 27 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages, 29 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["ryan j gallagher", "rew j reagan", "christopher m danforth", "peter sheridan dodds"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06820"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.06820.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Divergent discourse between protests and counter-protests: #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter", "authors": ["Ryan J.

In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis of over 860,000 tweets, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. We find that #AllLivesMatter facilitates opposition between #BlackLivesMatter and hashtags such as #PoliceLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter in such a way that historically echoes the tension between Black protesters and law enforcement. In addition, we show that a significant portion of #AllLivesMatter use stems from hijacking by #BlackLivesMatter advocates. Beyond simply injecting #AllLivesMatter with #BlackLivesMatter content, these hijackers use the hashtag to directly confront the counter-protest notion of \u201cAll lives matter.\u201d Our findings suggest that Black Lives Matter movement was able to grow, exhibit diverse conversations, and avoid derailment on social media by making discussion of counter-protest opinions a central topic of #AllLivesMatter, rather than the movement itself.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
