INTRODUCTION", "text": "Recognition of event-related queries is a challenging task [4, 10, 13]. It is the first step before applying a suitable time-conscious query and ranking model to improve overall effectiveness and search experience [2, 7, 15, 16]. One way to detect events is to analyze changes in query popularity of those queries that are frequently repeated, not those in the long tail. In popular queries, search traffic typically exhibits certain temporal patterns that change over time, such as sharp peaks, weekly or monthly periodicity, and seasonality. Examples of pointed queries break NewsPermission, digital or printed copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use are granted at no charge, provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial reasons, and that copies of this note and the complete quotation of the first page of this third-party work must be reproduced."}, {"heading": "2016, Pisa, Italy", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead in order to achieve the objectives I have mentioned."}, {"heading": "2. PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "Given training samples {{X1, Y1}, {X2, Y2},., {Xm, Ym}, each Xi is a query instance that is a vector of characteristics, i.e. Xi, Rd, and d is the dimension of attribute space consisting of various metrics aimed at identifying the type of events. We use different characteristics, namely time series characteristics from signal processing [3, 6, 9], along with characteristics consisting of click information [8] and standard statistical characteristics [11, 18]. In total, there are 28 different characteristics derived from two main sources (short-term query protocols and a long-term, external document collection). The reason for using these data sources is twofold. First, we want to detect events by temporal search patterns shown in query logs, such as, burstiness, trend, or seasonality."}, {"heading": "3. STACKED MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON", "text": "It has long been a cherished belief in the field of neural network research that the composition of multiple layers of nonlinearity is the key to efficiently modelling complex relationships between variables and achieving a better generalization of tasks. [24] This viewpoint is motivated in part by knowledge of the layered architecture of the human brain, such as overcoming one or more hidden layers."}, {"heading": "4. PRELIMINARY RESULTS", "text": "In this section we will first explain our experimental settings including data sets, relevance assessments and evaluation methods. We conducted experiments with different learning methods on an MLP model and then applied the stable learning method to our proposed S-MLP model. Learning methods play an important role in training neural networks that influence convergence performance, such as speed and optimization ability. Therefore, we varied the size of the training data and compared different learning methods in their convergence rates and loss values. Finally, we will show comparison results with the most modern methods and discuss the experimental results of our evaluation."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experimental Setting", "text": "The first set of data is the AOL query log, which consists of more than 30 million queries covering the period from March 1 to May 31, 2006; the second set of data we used is the MSN query log, which consists of about 15 million queries. User information is anonymized and adult queries are ignored from our study; for an external time collection, we used the New York Times Annotated Corpus, which contains over 1.8 million articles covering a period from January 1987 to June 2007; there is no standard data set for our problem of multi-level query classification; so we created a series of ground-level events consisting of 837 manually identified events; we simulated the hit time, every two weeks, and extracted a set of features for each event-related query."}, {"heading": "4.2 Learning Methods of MLP", "text": "Different learning methods are compared with different portions of training data; their convergence curves are illustrated in Figure 3. As can be seen, the model tends to converge while a greater proportion of training data is learned; while small data is used for training, any sound can cause distortion, and therefore, when 20% to 40% of training data is used, there are more tremors for most learning methods. Seven types of learning methods are compared: constant learning rate, gradually decreased learning rate with Nesterov's dynamics, constant with dynamics, gradually decreased with dynamics, Adam method and constant with Nesterov's dynamics. Among them, the Adam [17] method outperforms other methods in terms of convergence and small loss function values. Therefore, we apply the Adam method in the later part of the experiments."}, {"heading": "4.3 Comparison with State-of-the-art", "text": "Finally, we compare our S-MLP model with state-of-the-art methods and show their comparative precision in classifying multiclass in Figure 4. Our S-MLP model has significantly outperformed other methods, achieving 89% mean mean precision (MAP) compared to Naive Bayes (47%), LibSVM (51%) and MLP (69%). Remarkably, our S-MLP model outperforms other methods in classifying breaking and meme events where most other methods fail."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We proposed an approach to detecting event-related queries based on a deep learning model. Deep neural networks are very meaningful in representing training data, which is also confirmed in experiments that the more MLPs stacked in the model, the better performance is achieved. Stacking multiple non-linear hidden layers makes the model very deep, so that it can have very complicated relationships between inputs and outputs, i.e. multiple classes of events. However, overfitting in such networks can be a serious problem. As explained in [22], many of these complicated relationships will be the result of sampling noise, so that they will exist in the training set, but not in real test data, even when pulled from the same distribution, which also leads to overadjustments. For our future work, overfitting is our most important consideration. One option would be to adopt units that randomly fall along with their connections from the neural network so that they overlap during training."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning Deep Architectures for AI", "author": ["Y.
