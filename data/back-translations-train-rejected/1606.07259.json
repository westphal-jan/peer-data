For example, a motion sensor in a bedroom can be triggered by tossing and turning in bed or by getting up. We try to derive the actual activity depending on the context (time, previous events, etc.). In this paper we introduce the notion of label refinements, which links more abstract event descriptions with their more refined counterparts. We present a statistical evaluation method to determine the usefulness of a label refinement for a given event log from a process perspective.

Introduction", "text": "The process mining task is the automatic or semi-automatic analysis of events that are logged during the execution of processes, with event records containing information about what was done, by whom, for whom, when, etc. However, events are grouped into cases (process instances), e.g. per patient for a hospital log or per insurance claim for an insurance company. An important task within the process mining is process discovery, which focuses on extracting interpretable models for which the corresponding author is responsible.

These event labels are then used as transition / activity in the process models created by process discovery algorithms."}, {"heading": "2. Label Refinements & Process Models", "text": "In this section, we introduce the terms associated with event logs and re-labeling functions for tracks and then define the terms of refinements and abstractions. We also introduce the Petri net process model of notation. We use the usual sequence definition and designate a sequence by listing its elements, for example, we write < a1, a2,.., a > event for a (finite) sequence s: {1,., n}. An event of elements from any alphabet A where s (i) = ai for each i universe,., n}. The length of a sequence s: {1,.,., n}. \u2192 A is the element of sequences s1 and s2 denotes the concatenation of sequences s2. A language L via an alphabet is a series of sequences about A. Lp is the prefix closure of a language L (with L Lp).An event is the most elementary element of an event."}, {"heading": "3.1. Label Refinement Quality", "text": "Comparing the languages generated by models is not feasible due to their complexity; for many classes of process models, including petri nets, the problem of language inclusion is simply not decidable. Therefore, we need a different, practical approach to decide on the usefulness of refining the re-labeling function. Let's start by discussing the usefulness by comparing the detected models. Let's look at event log L, re-labeling functions l1, l2, l3 so that l2, l1, l3, l1 and event logs L1 = l1 (L), L2 = l2 (L), L3 = l3 (L). Let the N1, N2, N3 in Figure 4 be the petrinets that by applying the process discovery to L1, L2, L3 or the event log L1 = l1 (L), L2 = l3 (L), L3 = (L), L3 (L), L2 = 3 (L) are not interconnected to each other because there is no sense between the results within L1 and L3 (L = 1)."}, {"heading": "4. Evaluation Method for Label Refinements for Process Models", "text": "In the previous section, we showed that we can compare the usefulness of a label refinement by examining the petri net we obtained with the process refinement. However, a naive method for evaluating label refinement would be to apply the process refinement to all possible label refinements. However, the number of label refinements under consideration can be large and the process finding is a mathematically costly task. Therefore, this naive approach quickly becomes mathematically unfeasible. We now present a way to estimate the usefulness of a label refinement based on statistics and protocol relations. Algorithm 1 shows the steps of the label refinement evaluation method. The evaluation method consists of an entropy component that measures whether a label refinement makes the protocol statistics more unbalanced, and a statistical test that verifies whether there is a label refinement that makes a statistically significant difference to at least one statistical measure of the two."}, {"heading": "4.1. Log Statistics", "text": "Event order patterns are critical for most process discovery algorithms. Table 2 provides an overview of known log-based order relationships described in the process discovery literature. Let L be an event log. The formal definitions of these log-based order statistics are as follows: \u2022 # + L, > (b, c) is the number of occurrences of b in the tracks of L directly followed by c, i.e. in some log-based order statistics."}, {"heading": "4.2. Information Gain", "text": "The binary entropy function, Hb (p) = \u2212 p log2 p \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) log2 (1 \u2212 p), where 0 log2 0 = 0, is a measure of uncertainty. However, the binary entropy function represents a degree of non-determinism. Non-deterministic, unbalanced, logged statistics are helpful for the process discovery algorithms, which are based on protocol statistics, as they provide a low level of uncertainty about the mining algorithm. Low entropy in the protocol statistics indicates a high predictability of the process, making it easier to create a reasonable process model.Consider the quota tables in Table 4, based on protocol statistics generated from Table 1 between events labeled Tossing & Getting up and events labeled Living Room Motion. On the right side of the table, separated by the bar, are the protocol splits of the pre-logs-logs-logs-logs-logs-logs-logs-logs-logs-logs-logs."}, {"heading": "4.3. Statistical Testing", "text": "Relative information gains can be high for refinement if the generated refined terms are rare. Statistical testing of log statistical differences in addition to the calculation of relative information gains allows us to distinguish between information gains obtained by chance and actual information gain. Fisher's exact test5 is a statistical significance test for the analysis of contingency tables. When applied to the above table, it calculates a p-value for the null hypothesis that a1 and a2 events are equally likely to have a log relation to labeling b. Fisher's exact test assumptions for independence and row and column totals that need to be fixed. Independence of individual observations could be influenced by group-specific observation."}, {"heading": "4.4. Correcting for Multiple Testing", "text": "The computational complexity indicates the number of hypotheses performed. If a large number of potential label refinements are evaluated, the evaluation method described is susceptible to the repeated test problem. The larger the number of hypotheses tested, the higher the probability that the null hypothesis is incorrectly discarded in at least one of the hypotheses tests. By applying a Bonferroni correction 3.4 to the hypotheses tests performed in the statistical evaluation method of label refinements, the familial error rate remains constant."}, {"heading": "4.5. Example Case", "text": "Let's look at the event log in Table 1 and imagine a scenario in which an elderly carer knows from experience that the alarm clock is always set to 8: 30 a.m. On the basis of this expert knowledge, we are able to define a label refinement in such a way that all bedroom movements after 8: 30 a.m. are considered to be wake-up events, while all other bedroom movements are considered pivotal and turning events. The right column shows the refined labels obtained through this expert function. To evaluate the usefulness of this label refinement from the point of view of the process model, we apply the statistical evaluation method described in Section 4. As a parameter, we set the significance threshold to the frequently used value 01.1. Table 5 shows the result of the statistical tests performed as part of the label refinement evaluation. Four hypotheses tests have been performed, followed by Bonferroni-correction of each statistic is immediately indicated as 0,000.14."}, {"heading": "5. Real life evaluation", "text": "We apply our label refinement to a series of candidate-label refinements to illustrate the effects of label splits in the context of real life processes. Van Kasteren's dataset consists of 1285 events occurring in the days from midnight to midnight. Candidate refinements consist of two event locations each based on time."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "We have developed a theoretical and conceptual idea of when label refinements and abstractions are useful from the point of view of process discovery. On the basis of this notion of utility, we have demonstrated a statistical and information theory-based framework for evaluating the usefulness of a label refinement or abstraction. In addition, we have demonstrated the applicability of this statistical framework in a real-life smart home case, where our method has selected two label refinements from a larger set of candidates that have increased the precision of the resulting process model. Methods for automatically tracing useful label refinements from event attributes have yet to be explored. Such methods can produce a series of label refinements by candidates, according to which the statistical evaluation method described in this paper can be used to select the most promising label refinement from a range of candidate label refinements."}], "references": [{"title": "A survey of ontology evaluation techniques", "author": ["J.
