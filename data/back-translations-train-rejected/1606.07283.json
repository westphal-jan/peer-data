In many cases, events recorded in the event log are too fine-grained, causing process discovery algorithms to discover incomprehensible process models or process models that are not representative of the event log. We show that when process discovery algorithms are only able to discover an unrepresentative process model from a low-level event log, structure in the process can in some cases still be discovered by first abstracting the event log to a higher level of granularity. This gives rise to the challenge to bridge the gap between an original low-level event log and a desired high-level perspective on this log, such that a more structured or more comprehensible process model can be discovered. We show that supervised learning can be leveraged for the event abstraction task when annotations with high-level interpretations of the low-level events are available for a subset of the sequences (i.e., traces). We present a method to generate feature vector representations of events based on XES extensions, and describe an approach to abstract events in an event log with Condition Random Fields using these event features. Furthermore, we propose a sequence-focused metric to evaluate supervised event abstraction results that fits closely to the tasks of process discovery and conformance checking. We conclude this paper by demonstrating the usefulness of supervised event abstraction for obtaining more structured and/or more comprehensible process models using both real life event data and synthetic event data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 12:12:45 GMT  (1178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07283v1", "paper to appear in the proceedings of the SAI Intelligent Systems Conference 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "paper to appear in the proceedings of the SAI Intelligent Systems Conference 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["niek tax", "natalia sidorova", "reinder haakma", "wil m p van der aalst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07283"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.07283.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Event Abstraction for Process Mining using Supervised Learning Techniques", "authors": ["Niek Tax", "Natalia Sidorova", "Reinder Haakma"], "emails": ["n.tax@tue.nl", "n.sidorova@tue.nl", "reinder.haakma@philips.com", "w.m.p.v.d.aalst@tue.nl"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "II.

Conditional random fields model the conditional probability distribution of the label sequence using a loglinear model. We use linear chain conditional random fields, a subclass of conditional random fields that is widely used for sequence labeling tasks and takes the following form: p (y | x) = 1Z (x) exp (\u2211 t = 1-k-kfk) exp (t, yt \u2212 1, yt \u2212 x), where Z (x) is the normalization factor, X = < x1."}, {"heading": "IV.

In addition, we describe functions on XES event logs in a general way through the use of XES extensions. Figure 6 provides a conceptual overview of the monitored event abstraction method. The approach takes two inputs, 1) a set of annotated tracks that are tracks in which the high-level events that a low-level event belongs to (the label attribute of the low-level event) is known to all low-level events in the track, and 2) a set of uncommented tracks that are tracks in which the low-level events are not associated with the high-level events.

Evaluating High-level Event Predictions for Process Mining Applications", "text": "Existing approaches in the field of activity detection assume time frames in which each time frame is represented by a feature vector describing the sensor activity or status during that time frame. Therefore, evaluation methods in the field of activity detection are window-based and use evaluation metrics such as the percentage of correctly classified time frames IEEE 6 | P a g e [12], [18], [11]. There are two reasons to deviate from this evaluation method in a process mining setting: First, our method works on events instead of time frames. Second, the accuracy of the resulting high-level sequences for many process mining techniques (e.g. process detection, conformity testing) is much more important than the accuracy of the prediction of each minute of the day. We use Levenshtein similarity, which expresses the degree in which two traces are similar, using a metric which is based on a maximum distance (known as a sequence) from a deviation (a variation)."}, {"heading": "VI. CASE STUDY 1: SMART HOME ENVIRONMENT", "text": "We use the Smart Home environment protocol described by Van Kasteren et al. [11] to evaluate our method of monitored event log abstraction. The Van Kasteren protocol consists of multi-dimensional time series data with all binary dimensions, with each binary dimension representing the state of an in-home sensor. These sensors include motion sensors, open / close sensors and power sensors (discredited to 0 / 1 states)."}, {"heading": "A. Experimental setup", "text": "We transform the multidimensional time series data of sensors into events by treating each sensor interchange point as an event. Cases are generated by grouping events that occurred on the same day, with a midnight cut-off point. High-level labels are provided for the Van Kasteren dataset. The generated event log based on the Van Kasteren dataset has the following XES extensions: Concept The sensor that generated the event. Time The time stamp of the sensor interchange point. Lifecycle begins when the event represents a change in sensor value from 0 to 1 and complete when there is a change in sensor value from 1 to 0.Note that annotations are provided for all tracks in the received event log. To assess how well the supervised event abstraction method has been generalized to uncommented tracks, we artificially use a portion of the tracks to apply the abstraction model and not apply them to a reference set."}, {"heading": "B. Results", "text": "Figure 7a shows the result of the inductive miner [6] for the low-level events discovered in the Van Kasteren dataset. The resulting process model starts with many parallel activities that can be executed in any order and contains many unobservable transitions back. This strongly resembles the flower model, which allows any behavior in any order. From the process model we can learn that toilet flush and cupboard cups often co-exist. Furthermore, the process model points out that food cabinet is often followed by dishwasher. There appears to be very little structure at this level of the event granularity. The average levenshtein similarity between the predicted high-level trace traces in the leave-one-trace-out-cross-validation experimental setup and the soil truth trace at high level is 0.7042, which shows that the superior event abstraction method produces traces that are fairly similar to the bottom truth-out-the result we predicted at the bottom 7b of the inductive level."}, {"heading": "VII. CASE STUDY 2: ARTIFICIAL DIGITAL PHOTOCOPIER", "text": "Bose et al. [30], [31] created a synthetic event log based on a digital photocopier to evaluate its uncontrolled methods of event abstraction.

Experimental setup", "text": "We commented on each low-level event with the correct high-level event using domain knowledge from the current process model as described by Bose et al. [30], [31]. This event log is generated by a hierarchical process in which the highest-level events are defined Capture Image, Rasterize Image, Image Processing and Print Image in terms of a process model. The Print Image sub-process includes, among other things, the events Writing, Developing and Fusing, which are themselves defined as sub-processes. In this case study, we are rearranging the task so that the protocols Capture Image, Rasterize Image and Image Processing, Writing, Fusing and Developing.IEEE 7 | P a eSubprocesses Writing and Developing both contain the event types Drum Spin Start and Drum Spin Stop. In this case study, we are focusing in particular on the Drum Spin Start and Drum Spin Stop events, since they do not make the abstraction task trivial in the sense of this event a higher-level event, not a larger one."}, {"heading": "B. Results", "text": "The confusion matrix in Table II shows the aggregated results of mapping low-level events Drum Spin Start and Drum Spin Stop to high-level events development and writing. Results show that the monitored event abstraction is able to detect the many too many mappings between the low and high levels as it maps these low IEEE 8 | P a g eevents to the correct high-level events without making mistakes. Levenshtein similarity between the aggregated high-level test folds and the soil guidelines is almost perfect: 0.9667. Figure 8a shows the process model obtained with the low-level events in artificial photocopy. The two sections in the process model surrounded by high-level lines are examples of high-level events that are high-level."}, {"heading": "VIII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we described a method for abstracting events in an XES event log that is too low, based on supervised learning. An implementation of the described method was provided as a plug-in to the ProM 6 Process Mining Toolkit. We introduced an assessment metric for predicted high-level tracks that is more similar to process mining than time window-based methods commonly used in sequence marking. Using a real event log from a smart home domain, we showed that supervised event logs can be used to enable process finding techniques at the highest level, even when process models detected by process mining techniques on the original low events are unstructured. Finally, we showed onIEEE 9 | P a synthetic event log that can be used to detect smaller, more intelligible process models at the highest level, in order to interpret the process as too large at the low level."}], "references": [{"title": "Process mining: Discovery, conformance and enhancement of business processes", "author": ["W.M.P. van der Aalst"], "venue": "Springer Science & Business Media,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Workflow mining: Discovering process models from event logs", "author": ["W.M.P. van der Aalst", "A.J.M.M.

in processes from event logs. In many cases, events recorded in the event log are too fine-grained, causing process discovery algorithms to discover incomprehensible process models or process models that are not representative of the event log. We show that when process discovery algorithms are only able to discover an unrepresentative process model from a low-level event log, structure in the process can in some cases still be discovered by first abstracting the event log to a higher level of granularity. This gives rise to the challenge to bridge the gap between an original low-level event log and a desired high-level perspective on this log, such that a more structured or more comprehensible process model can be discovered. We show that supervised learning can be leveraged for the event abstraction task when annotations with high-level interpretations of the low-level events are available for a subset of the sequences (i.e., traces). We present a method to generate feature vector representations of events based on XES extensions, and describe an approach to abstract events in an event log with Condition Random Fields using these event features. Furthermore, we propose a sequence-focused metric to evaluate supervised event abstraction results that fits closely to the tasks of process discovery and conformance checking. We conclude this paper by demonstrating the usefulness of supervised event abstraction for obtaining more structured and/or more comprehensible process models using both real life event data and synthetic event data.
