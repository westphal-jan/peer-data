As such, they are a very attractive target for the creation of procedural content generation (PCG), i.e. the creation of artifacts via an algorithm. Most PCG levels have been achieved by man-made rules, from early computer games such as Rogue to modern games such as No Man's Sky. Much of the academic work has been done in this area using classic AI techniques such as Constraint Satisfaction (Smith, Whitehead and Mateas 2010), Answer Set Programming (Smith et al. 2012), Evolutionary Algorithms (Sorenson and Pasquier 2010) and others. More recently, statistical AI, i.e. Machine Learning (ML), techniques such as Bayes Nets (Summerville et al al al. 2015), Markov ins (Snodgrass, Philip and Guzn 2015), Plius (Naha), for example."}, {"heading": "RELATED WORK", "text": "Collecting resources to create a common corpus is commonplace in areas like Natural Language Processing (NLP). A large number of corporas exist in the NLP community, but the two most notable are COCA: \"the Corpus of Contemporary American English\" (Davies 1990) and the Wall Street Journal Corpus (Paul and Baker 1992). Similarly, many corporas are available in the machine learning community for a variety of different tasks, including image classification (Krizhevsky, Nair, and Hinton 2016), handwriting recognition (Lecville and Cortes 2016), and speech recognition (Godfrey, Holliman, and McDaniel 1992)."}, {"heading": "DATASETS", "text": "There are three annotation formats: tile, chart and vector. A breakdown of the games can be found in Table 1. Most of the games in the corpus are 2D tile-based side scrolling games, which are all annotated with the tile format, as are the levels of Doom, Doom 2, Mario Kart and the first quest of The Legend of Zelda. Levels from The Legend of Zelda series, which have a spatial level structure, are also annotated in graph format, and the levels from the Doom series can also be found in vector format."}, {"heading": "Annotation Formats", "text": "It's not that we're not able to find such a solution, \"he said.\" But it's not that we want it, \"he said.\" It's not that we want it, \"he said.\" But it's that we don't want it. \"\" It's not that we want it. \""}, {"heading": "TOOLS", "text": "In addition to the levels, we also included tools we used in the processing, including a tile-based platformer A \u0445 solver and a parser and raster for Doom WAD files. The Platformer Solver takes a JSON file that acts as a legend (and tells it which tiles are fixed) and the dynamics of the game (what does a jump arc look like) and creates paths through a particular level. The Doom parser and raster takes WAD files (the data format for Doom and Doom-like tiles) and produces either the SVG or tile-based levels found in the corpus."}, {"heading": "POTENTIAL USAGE", "text": "In the hope of stimulating future research, some potential applications of the VGLC are listed below."}, {"heading": "Corpora Based Procedural Content Generation", "text": "The tile format is designed so that almost any text-based approach (Markov chains, recursive neural networks, etc.) can produce results, but due to their grid-based nature, they can also be translated into a form that can easily be used for image-based methods (Markov random fields, revolutionary neural networks, etc.) The graph could be used for graphical learning or other graph-based approaches (spectral analysis, relational learning), which can also be processed, such as in the work of London o and Missura (none and Missura 2015), or Summerville and Mateas (Summerville and Mateas 2016), where simulated agents run through levels to determine how a player could actually cross the levels. We know that the only games used for a company-based generation, Super Mario Bros., Kriid Icarus, The Legend and other games are of importance for the round."}, {"heading": "Design Analysis", "text": "Dahlskog and Togelius (Dahlskog and Togelius 2012) conducted an analysis on 20 levels of Super Mario Bros. to find design patterns that could be used for PCG research, but even in the Super Mario Bros. area, this corpus contains another 34 levels to be analyzed. Similarly, Dormans (Dormans 2010) performed an analysis of the mission and physical structure of a level from The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and although none of the 3D Zelda games is included in this corpus, there are 48 levels from the 2D games in the series that could be analyzed."}, {"heading": "Style Transfer", "text": "All work was concentrated on a single game or series, and when work comprised several games, the work was always divided up. Following the work of Gatys et al. (Gatys, Ecker and Bethge 2015), there was an interest in applying different artistic styles to images, similarly, we imagine that an interesting way for future work could be to reinvent levels of one game in the style of another, or a user could sketch the skeleton of a level and in turn generate variations based on different game styles."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We present this corpus in the hope of helping the community. Any group of researchers who have used corpora-based approaches to machine learning have had to reinvent this admittedly not-quite-exciting wheel, so we expect this work to be adopted by the community to focus on more exciting and innovative work. VGLC is already available online (https: / / github.com / TheVGLC / TheVGLC) and ready to go. We also encourage researchers to contribute additional games and tools to this corpus to make it more useful to the community."}], "references": [{"title": "Patterns and procedural content generation: Revisiting mario in world 1 level 1", "author": ["Dahlskog", "S.
