In this paper we will consider the question of whether strategies implied by theories of strategic behavior can be used by automated agents that interact proficiently with people. We will focus on automated agents that we built that need to interact with people in two negotiation settings: bargaining and deliberation. For bargaining we will study game-theory based equilibrium agents and for argumentation we will discuss logic-based argumentation theory. We will also consider security games and persuasion games and will discuss the benefits of using equilibrium based agents.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 00:30:07 GMT  (308kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07514v1", "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "authors": ["sarit kraus"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07514"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.07514.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Human-Agent Decision-making: Combining Theory and Practice", "authors": ["Sarit Kraus"], "emails": ["sarit@cs.biu.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "R.

That is, we assume that the automated agent, when interfering in the interaction, should act as best as possible to realize his preferences. Game theory is the mathematical theory of strategic decision-making [28], and therefore it seems that game theory could be a suitable analytical tool to understand how a strategic agent can and should act, and that it could also be useful in designing automated agents and protocols for interactions. However, game theory assumes that all players will act as well as possible to realize their preferences. Unfortunately, people tend to make mistakes, and they are influenced by cognitive, social, and cultural factors that impede interaction."}, {"heading": "2 Multi-issue negotiations", "text": "Over the years, we have developed and implemented several automated agents for multi-topic negotiations, and in multi-topic negotiations, the actors must come to an agreement on multiple topics. Each topic is associated with a set of possible values, and the actors must agree on a specific value for each topic. Negotiations can end with the negotiators signing an agreement or one of the parties withdrawing from the negotiations. If the crisis does not end within a pre-determined period of time, the status quo will be implemented, and every outcome of the negotiations is associated with a benefit for both actors. A summary of our agents is shown in Table 1."}, {"heading": "2.1 EQH agent", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules that they have set themselves, and they will be able to play by the rules that they have set themselves in order to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "2.2 QOagent and KBagent", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2.3 NegoChat Agent", "text": "There is a lack of the natural language processing necessary to facilitate real-world interactions. To meet this challenge, we first developed an NLP module that benefits people in a chat-like environment (see Figure 1 for the negotiation system interface to chat-based negotiations). We found that simply changing the KBagent to include an NLP module is insufficient to create a good agent for such constellations, and the revised agent has achieved relatively low usage (see Figure 1 for the chat-based negotiation interface)."}, {"heading": "3 Negotiations and Actions Interleaving", "text": "These studies were conducted in a configurable system called Colored Trails (CT) 1, a game played by two or more participants on a board of colored squares. CT is an abstract, conceptually simple, but extremely versatile game in which players negotiate and exchange resources to achieve their individual or group goals. It provides a realistic analogy to multi-agent tasks, but does not require extensive domain modeling [15, 18]. A summary of the agents we developed is listed in Table 2.1See http: / / www.eecs.harvard.edu / ai / ct."}, {"heading": "3.1 Revelation games", "text": "We often considered the negotiation situations in which participants do not have information about each other's preferences as an obstacle to achieving favorable results. In particular, we examined a particular class of such settings, which we call \"disclosure games,\" in which two players have the opportunity to exercise their privacy before starting two rounds of alternating negotiations. This information is narrowed down to the scope of possible agreements and leads to an agreement, but it also leads to players being exploited by others (see examples of such games in Figure 2)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Non-binding agreements", "text": "We looked at two players \"CT settings, in which both had to complete their individual tasks by reaching agreements and exchanging resources; the number of rounds of negotiations was not determined in advance, and the negotiation protocol was an alternating offer protocol that allowed the parties to choose the extent to which they would honor their respective agreements during the negotiations. [19] That is, there are three phases in each round of the game: negotiation, transfer, and movement; the negotiation phase consisted of two rounds of alternating offers in which the players could reach an agreement on the exchange of resources; after each negotiation phase, the game moved to the\" transfer phase, \"in which both players could transfer resources to each other so that none of the other players could see what the other player was transferring until the end of the phase. A player could choose to transfer more resources than he had agreed upon, or a subset of resources that he had agreed upon."}, {"heading": "3.3 Contract Game", "text": "We studied commitment strategies in a three-player CT game. The game is called Contract Game and is analogous to a market where participants enter into and commit to contracts or have to exit contracts to succeed. [20] The game consists of three players, two service providers and one customer. Service providers compete for repeated contract offers to customers consisting of exchanging resources in the game (see an example of such a game in Figure 4). We formally analyzed the game to calculate subgame perfect balance strategies for the customer and service providers in the game based on contracts that involve engagement. To evaluate agents using balance strategies, we conducted extensive empirical studies in three different countries, the US, Israel and China. We ran several configurations in which a single agent played participants in different roles."}, {"heading": "4 Argumentation Agent", "text": "An automated agent can help a human being if he engages in an argumentative dialogue by using his knowledge and arithmetic advantage to provide arguments to him. Argumentation has been extensively studied using well-established argumentation theory (see [41] for a summary). Therefore, in the first step in developing an automated agent to advise people in such an environment, we have taken into account the capabilities of argumentation theory to predict people's arguments. In [38] we presented extensive studies in three experimental constellations of varying complexity showing the lack of predictive power of existing argumentation theory. Secondly, we used machine learning techniques (ML) to provide a probability distribution of all known arguments on partial observation. That is, our ML techniques provided the probability that each argument will be used next in a given dialogue. Our model achieves 76% accuracy in predicting the three main arguments of the people we sought to base hypocrisy on the PRE, and the PRE agents we only used in redividing the arguments of the PRE model of the people last time."}, {"heading": "5 Security Games", "text": "In recent years, we have seen the successful use of Bayesian Stackelberg games in the allocation of limited resources to protect critical infrastructure, an interesting effort led by Prof. Milind Tambe of USC. The first application is the ARMOR (Assistant for Randomized Monitoring over Routes) system, which was deployed at Los Angeles International Airport to initiate checkpoints on the roads that require the airport and the dog patrol routes within the airport terminals. Other applications include IRIS, a randomized schedule for the deployment of the US Federal Marshal Service (FAMS), which requires significant scalability in terms of the algorithms required in the deployment of airport terminals."}, {"heading": "6 Persuasion Games", "text": "A persuasion game involves two players: a sender who tries to convince another agent (the recipient) to take a certain action [17]. Convincation games are similar to both the negotiation games and the security games [43]. They are similar to the negotiations and arguments games, as one player tries to convince another player to do something, as in the negotiations. Furthermore, the inclusion of a limited rational model of the recipient is beneficial for the sender and the attacker. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether balance strategies in the persuasion games are beneficial. Furthermore, the inclusion of such a model in the receiver model is advantageous, as the inclusion of rational models in the defenders is advantageous."}, {"heading": "7 Discussions", "text": "The state-of-the-art agent, NegoChat, for multi-issue negotiations integrates methods from several disciplines: qualitative decision-making, machine learning and heuristics based on psychological theories. None of the equilibrium agents developed have been successful in interacting with humans. Dependence on heuristic and machine learning makes the transfer of NegoChat from one scenario to another and from one culture to another problematic, as was recently demonstrated when we tried to conduct experiments with NegoChat, which was developed based on data collected in Israel and Egypt. We had to spend a lot of time and effort to make this transfer possible. Likewise, in most cases the equilibrium agent was not successful in the CT game settings. The only exception is the contract game. We believe that the success of the equilibrium agent in the contractual game has to do with the specifics of the game."}, {"heading": "8 Acknowledgment", "text": "This work was partially supported by ERC grant No. 267523."}], "references": [{"title": "Collaborative health care plan support", "author": ["O.

An important question is whether we can use these theories to design agents for interacting with people? On the one hand, they provide a formal design specification for agent strategies. On the other hand, people do not necessarily adhere to playing in accordance with these strategies, and their behavior is affected by a multitude of social and psychological factors. In this paper we will consider the question of whether strategies implied by theories of strategic behavior can be used by automated agents that interact proficiently with people. We will focus on automated agents that we built that need to interact with people in two negotiation settings: bargaining and deliberation. For bargaining we will study game-theory based equilibrium agents and for argumentation we will discuss logicbased argumentation theory. We will also consider security games and persuasion games and will discuss the benefits of using equilibrium based agents.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
