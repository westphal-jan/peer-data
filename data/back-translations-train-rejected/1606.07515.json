An immediate question is: Whenever Group G is a real subgroup of the group of all actors, what do the other actors know about the fact that this event is taking place? Here, we will model situations in which there is common knowledge among the other actors that the event is taking place, but not what the members of the group are learning. As discussed in the introduction, this corresponds to a natural class of information exchange events, namely publicly observable private communication, such as a meeting in a closed space that is being observed. This is captured by a global model update: in each state, a connection to another state is removed for each G member if it is not the case that there is a connection to that state for all members of G-Formell, if a model M = (S, V) and a group of actors G, the (global) G-dissolved update of M operations is the model M-G, where M | G languages exist as an H model."}, {"heading": "3.1 Some Validities", "text": "Let's start with a trivial validity: Dissolution has no effect on a single coalition.
