CSP was realized in the distributed programming language OCCAM (see INMOS [12]). The main difference is that we use epistemic formulas and primitive communication calls that do not require synchronization. Moreover, the syntax of our distributed programs is very limited. In order to define gossip logs, we introduce calls and epistemic guards in return. Throughout the escore essay, we assume a fixed limited group A of at least three agents. We assume that each agent holds exactly one secret and that there is a bijection between the group of agents and the group of secrets. We use P to denote the set of secrets (for propositions). Furthermore, it is assumed that any secret containing the identifying agents belongs to the secret."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 Calls", "text": "Each call concerns two agents, the caller (a below) and the called agent (b).

After this call, the called agent learns all the secrets of the caller, pull, written as b. After this call, the caller learns all the secrets of the called agent. Variables for calls are referred to as c, d. Under misuse of the notation, we write a \"c\" to indicate that agent a is one of the two agents involved in the call c (e.g. for c: = ab we have a \"c\" and b \"c).
