Johan helped us place faith-based learning in the broader context of long-term doxastic protocols [7], and furthermore gave us his continued support and encouragement for our work on this line of research. Nick pointed out the connections between our work and the notions of TD space and locally coherent frameworks. Konstantin pointed out the connections with the concept of layering and provided the counterexample to the evidence of Proposition 5. His critical feedback on our early drafts was really important in clarifying our thoughts and cleaning up our evidence, so it is fair to say that this paper in its current form owes much to Konstantin Genin. Thomas Icard's comments on an earlier draft and our friendly interactions with him on related topics during our visits to Stanford are greatly appreciated."}], "references": [{"title": "On the Logic of Theory Change: Partial Meet Contraction and Revision Functions", "author": ["Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n", "Peter G\u00e4rdenfors", "David Makinson"], "venue": "Journal of Symbolic Logic", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1985}, {"title": "Inductive inference of formal languages from positive data", "author": ["Dana Angluin"], "venue": "Information and Control", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1980}, {"title": "Belief revision as a truth-tracking process", "author": ["Alexandru Baltag", "Nina Gierasimczuk", "Sonja Smets"], "venue": "In K.
