As Section 2 argues, the assumption that axioms apply in all states of the model is unwarranted; in fact, DLR itself rejects formal results, but they are not sufficiently general to exclude standard spatial models of the unconscious.

Although we believe that the attitude towards questions is primary, we will follow the literature on consciousness in order to axiomatise an idea of attention that has events as objects.

Just as with AC, if we understand more clearly the character of attention and conceivability and the distinction between sentences and what they express, the DLR axioms lose traction. The clearest case concerns plausibility and attention. One consequence of the contrapositivity of plausibility is K\u0441 \u2192 A\u0442. But this principle is wrong for attention. You know that there are more than four stars in the universe, but we doubt that you dealt with the question of how many stars there are before reading the previous clause.

[21] and [22]). In standard models for the space of the state, such as ours, it is trivial to add meaningful quantifiers without such consequences. To illustrate this, we write v [E / p] for the evaluation function that maps p to E and any other sentence letter q to v (q): 5J, pKM, v = E JKM, v [E / p] To illustrate that these quantifiers behave as one would expect, note that in state 1 of the example described in Section 4.3, the agent knows that she is unaware of nothing without knowing something that she does not know: K pU pKU is true in this state."}, {"heading": "4.7 Closure and Automorphisms", "text": "One might wonder whether we can also impose the limitations that what the agents are aware of must be closed under consciousness and knowledge. In other words, whether there are models on which the following axioms are valid: A-4ij Ai p \u2192 AiA j pAK-4 Ai p \u2192 AiK j pIn order to provide models that confirm these principles, we adapt the coherence limitation of [13].6 The idea behind this can most easily be described for consciousness as conceivable by taking the equivalence relations of partition models to represent a relationship of indistinguishability using conceptual resources available to the relevant agent in the relevant state. Coherence requires that if two states are indistinguishable in this way, there is a way to permutate the state space in a way that preserves all the structural facts about knowledge and consciousness, as well as all the events that the relevant agent is aware of."}, {"heading": "5 Decision Theory", "text": "In Section 4.5, the example of the number of stars illustrates how one can believe and know things in which one does not participate; clearly, this kind of inattention can also influence voting behavior. An advantage of standard state spaces is that we can use the usual decision-theoretical framework to represent the effects of inattention on voting behavior. 7The usual decision-theoretical representation of an agent's beliefs uses a measurement space < S, B, \u00b5 >.8 To generate a partial model, we enrich this description of the agent by selecting BC, a complete atomic subalgebra of B to produce a representation of what the agent pays attention to in the context of the election: < S, B, \u00b5, BC >. The atoms of BC are a division of S so that this structure produces a partial model of ignorance. The distribution that the agent \"uses\" in an election context is given as Alzit (C = E) for certain events that can be interpreted as E for certain factors."}, {"heading": "5.1 Speculative Trade", "text": "Building on the work of [2], [41] Alice demonstrated her famous \"no-trade\" theorem, which illustrates the extreme strength of S5 knowledge together with a common earlier one. Accordingly, one goal of representing \"limited\" agents such as those with limited attention is to escape such paradoxes (for this perspective see [45], [38]). Accordingly, we are now providing a partial DLR model with a common earlier state in which speculative trading is possible. As is known (see [16], [50], [49]), the \"no-trade\" theorem generally does not apply if agent-accessibility relationships Ri are merely transitive and reflexive, but not necessary to form an equivalence relationship. Plausibility is incompatible with Ri, which forms an equivalence relationship ([42])."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Standardized state-space models of attention and conceivability are at least as successful as current non-standard state-space models. However, the non-standard models are more complicated, and it is unclear whether this complexity offers any advantages in terms of predictive power or accuracy. Standardized state-space models of these phenomena promise to lead to a rich and worthwhile theory that poses technical and conceptual challenges and links to related work by linguists, philosophers, and logicians - as well as to work on limited thinking elsewhere in economic theory."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgments", "text": "Thanks to Eddie Dekel, Bart Lipman and Tim Williamson for the very helpful discussions on the drafts of this paper.
