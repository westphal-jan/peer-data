Consider the counter-fact, if Nixon had pressed the button, there would have been a nuclear holocaust. Call it the Nixon couterfactual.

We have presented theorems for completeness that show that the ceteris paribus logics thus obtained is ultimately reduced to the underlying counterfactual logic; in our case Lewis's VC.
