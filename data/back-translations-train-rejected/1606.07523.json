However, although this line of research has introduced many interesting mathematical and theoretical concepts into the field of routing, it has refrained from formulating its models as user requirements to be filled by various routing algorithms. The axiomatic approach that addresses problems with this outlook was first introduced in CS contexts as extensions to classical theory of choice [4] and has been applied to ranking systems [1, 2] and trust systems [3], as well as to other multi-agent setups such as multi-marketing [6]."}, {"heading": "3 Setup", "text": "Before introducing our axioms, we start by setting up our routing model.

In the course of examining this issue, we have developed several characteristics that we believe would be desirable by system planners. For example, robustness or the ability of a routing protocol to prevent small changes from disrupting the entire routing process is a characteristic that is needed especially in fast, changing networks. Of course, creating a structure of possible interactions between agents defined by a connection graph is not limited to information routing on networks such as the Internet. Considering organizations in which workers are connected according to their ability to each other, and instead of sending messages between them, we are trying to construct an organizational hierarchy, we face a similar challenge. Again, robustness is a desirable characteristic, as it means that some workers, if they have a deteriorating relationship with others, if they are not very managerial in the organization, will then consider \"having little impact on other economic obligations (in this case, we can only fully examine many).\""}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank Michael Schapira for his insightful discussions on this topic.
