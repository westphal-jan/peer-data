Then we develop a simple logical special-purpose language to formally express some key properties of our preference-sight models. Lastly, we show how short-sight SSDM scenarios call for substantial enrichments of existing fixed-point logics that have been developed for the classical BI solution concept.

The former is complete and perfect in the sense that the outsider has all the options in view along with the objective quality of those options, and thus can explicitly indicate the reward of each situation for the decision maker. In contrast, the decision maker's views may be limited to a near future, especially in large-scale environments. Furthermore, due to limited foresight, the actor may also falsely think about the quality of different decisions, leading to what we call subjective preferences. Both of the above perspectives are crucial: the former provides a complete picture of the environment, the latter shows the actual play of the decision maker.

A formula of LFP (FO), reflecting the recursive nature of BI, is constructed in [4, 6] to define the classic BI relationship, based on the above-mentioned property RAT. Now, we have shown that the vision-constrained SCBI is also a recursive game formula. Can we define the local BI relationship in visible trees - and if so, how? The answer is yes, but we need an extension. Instead of a binary relationship bi as in [4, 6] that characterizes SCBI, a ternary relationship in visible trees called Bisight is needed.

Of course, they can be extended to comprehensive multi-player game scenarios with short-sightedness, and for such a game model we can build on [14], which allows us to assume that the current player only knows his own eye, and that he believes that other players can see as much as he can see, and will play according to that belief. That is, this model excludes more complex forms of interactive knowledge and thinking, but based on the same assumption, our model in this essay can be extended directly to multiplayer cases. The only thing we need to do is to add an agent designation to SSDM: although players may change over time, everything, including vision, preference, and action, can be modelled from the perspective of the current player. We will not cite results for the extended multiplayer model, as they are quite similar to what we have already shown."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "Many recent game theory papers focusing on limited rationality have used a model of games with consciousness [15, 17, 21, 13, 16]. This approach generalizes the classical representation of large-scale games by modeling players who may not be aware of all paths. [14] While short-sightedness games are a well-educated subclass of conscious games, there is a fundamental difference in focus. Players in the latter approach may not know some industries, but they can always see some endgame strategies, while in the former the player's view only includes intermediate stories and consciously excludes all endgames. Furthermore, we have shown how short-sighted games allow for the natural coexistence of two views of a game, those of initiates and those of outsiders."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "I would like to thank Fenrong Liu for our fruitful collaboration on earlier versions of this paper.

scenarios in which an agent is limited by his/her computational ability to foresee all the available moves towards the future \u2013 that is, we study scenarios with short sight. We focus on how short sight affects the logical properties of decision making in multi-agent settings. We start with single-agent sequential decision making (SSDM) processes, modeling them by a new structure of \u2018preference-sight trees\u2019. Using this model, we first explore the relation between a new natural solution concept of Sight-Compatible Backward Induction (SCBI) and the histories produced by classical Backward Induction (BI). In particular, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the two analyses to be equivalent. Next, we study whether larger sight always contributes to better outcomes. Then we develop a simple logical special-purpose language to formally express some key properties of our preference-sight models. Lastly, we show how shortsight SSDM scenarios call for substantial enrichments of existing fixed-point logics that have been developed for the classical BI solution concept. We also discuss changes in earlier modal logics expressing \u2018surface reasoning\u2019 about best actions in the presence of short sight. Our analysis may point the way to logical and computational analysis of more realistic game models.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
