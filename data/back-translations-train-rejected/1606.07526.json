The model is a special case of DEL model checking. We provide a parameterized complexity analysis, considering several aspects of DEL (e.g., number of agents, size of preconditions, etc.) as parameters. We show that model checking for DEL is PSPACE-hard, also when restricted to single-pointed models and S5 relations, thereby solving an open problem in the literature. Our approach is aimed at formalizing current intractability claims in the cognitive science literature regarding computational models of ToM.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 00:32:51 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07526v1", "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["iris van de pol", "iris van rooij", "jakub szymanik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07526"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.07526.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Parameterized Complexity Results for a Model of Theory of Mind Based on Dynamic Epistemic Logic", "authors": ["Iris van de Pol", "Iris van Rooij", "Jakub Szymanik"], "emails": ["i.p.a.vandepol@uva.nl", "i.vanrooij@donders.ru.nl", "j.k.szymanik@uva.nl"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "R.
