Cooperative behavior when non-cooperation is a dominant strategy (with respect to the material payoffs) is particularly puzzling. Here we propose a novel approach to explain cooperation, assuming what Halpern and Pass call translucent players. Typically, players are assumed to be opaque, in the sense that a deviation by one player in a normal-form game does not affect the strategies used by other players. But a player may believe that if he switches from one strategy to another, the fact that he chooses to switch may be visible to the other players. For example, if he chooses to defect in Prisoner's Dilemma, the other player may sense his guilt. We show that by assuming translucent players, we can recover many of the regularities observed in human behavior in well-studied games such as Prisoner's Dilemma, Traveler's Dilemma, Bertrand Competition, and the Public Goods game.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 01:02:30 GMT  (84kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07533v1", "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295.

Formally, a (finite) normal form game G is a tuple (P, S1,.., si), where P = {1,.., N) is the set of players, Si is the set of strategies for player i, and Ui is the beliefs of player i. \"Let S = S1\" \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 SN and S \u2212 i \"6 = i.\" We assume that S is \"finite\" and that N. \"In standard game theory, a player is assumed to have i\" s beliefs about the strategies used by other players; i \"is rational if his strategy is the best answer to these beliefs. The default definition of the best reaction is the following. Definition 2.1\" A strategy si \"is an answer to a strategy i.\""}, {"heading": "3 Social dilemmas", "text": "There are situations where there is a tension between the collective interest and the individual interest: each individual has an incentive to deviate from the common good and act selfishly, but if everyone deviates, then they are all worse off. Many personal and professional relationships, the depletion of natural resources, the lowest dollar, energy security, and price competition in the markets can all be considered instances of social dilemmas, as we said in the introduction that we can formally consider a social dilemma as a normal form game with a unique Nash balance and a unique welfare maximization profile of companies, both of which are pure strategy profiles, so that the usefulness of each player is greater than its usefulness when playing sN. While this is a fairly limited game, it includes many that have been fairly well studied. Here, we focus on the following games: Prisoner's Dilemma. Two players can either cooperate (C) or a defect (D)."}, {"heading": "4 Explaining social dilemmas using translucency", "text": "As we suggested in the introduction, we hope to use transparency to explain cooperation in social dilemmas \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2, even if the players cannot see each other. We expect people to become accustomed to the assumption of a certain degree of transparency in their everyday interactions, which typically occur face to face, that they bring these strategies and beliefs into the laboratory environment, even if they may be inappropriate. To do so, we need to make assumptions about the beliefs of an actor who has these beliefs (\u03b1, \u03b2, C) if he intends to cooperate (parameter C stands for cooperation) and believes that (a) if he deviates from them, then any other actor will realize this regardless of the likelihood that he will apply these strategies. (b) If an actor j realizes that he will not cooperate, then he will fail; and (c) all other players will either cooperate or be flawed, and they will cooperate with probability."}, {"heading": "5 Comparison to other approaches", "text": "Here we show that approaches (which we are aware of) are different parameters from those of Charness and Rabin and possibly those of Bolton and Ockenfels. < / p > p > p > p > p > p > p < p > p > p < p > p > p > p > p (s) p > p (s) p > p (s) p > p (s) p > p (s) p > p (s) p (s) p (s) p (s) p (s) p (s) p (s) p > p > p (s) p > p (s) p > p (s) p > p (s) p > p (s) p (s) p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p.\" \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p. \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p. \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p.\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "We have presented an approach that explains a number of well-known observations regarding the extent of cooperation in social dilemmas, although this argument is limited to two factors. Furthermore, our approach can also be used to explain the apparent contradiction that people collaborate more in a one-sided approach when they do not know the other player's dilemma than when they do. In the latter case, Shafir and Tversky [44] can find that most people (90%) make mistakes, whereas in the former case only 63% of players do not know strategies that predict this behavior: If player 1 knows that player 2 makes decisions, then there is no translucency, our model predicts that player 1 knows defects for sure, if player 1 does not know strategies and believes that he is translucent to some degree, then, as shown in Proposition 4.1, he is willing to cooperate."}], "references": [{"title": "Selfishness level of strategic games", "author": ["K.R.

Typically, players are assumed to be opaque, in the sense that a deviation by one player in a normal-form game does not affect the strategies used by other players. But a player may believe that if he switches from one strategy to another, the fact that he chooses to switch may be visible to the other players. For example, if he chooses to defect in Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, the other player may sense his guilt. We show that by assuming translucent players, we can recover many of the regularities observed in human behavior in well-studied games such as Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, Traveler\u2019s Dilemma, Bertrand Competition, and the Public Goods game.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
