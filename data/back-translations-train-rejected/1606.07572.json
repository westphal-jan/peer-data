While there are numerous works that focus on establishing that two resources are identical and on adding more instances of an already existing relation, the problem of finding new relations between any two given datasets has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, given two entity sets, we present an unsupervised approach to enrich the LOD cloud with new relations between them by exploiting the web corpus. During the first phase we gather prospective relations from the corpus through pattern extraction and paraphrase detection. In the second phase, we perform actual enrichment by extracting instances of these relations. We have empirically evaluated our approach on several dataset pairs and found that the system can indeed be used for enriching the existing datasets with new relations.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 06:00:42 GMT  (34kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07572v1", "Technical report"], ["v2", "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 04:49:49 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07572v2", "Technical report"], ["v3", "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 11:12:42 GMT  (55kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07572v3", "Technical report"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["subhashree s", "p sreenivasa kumar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07572"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.07572.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Enriching Linked Datasets with New Object Properties", "authors": [], "emails": ["ssshree@cse.iitm.ac.in", "psk@cse.iitm.ac.in"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 6.07 572v 3 [cs.D B] 4S ep2 017Although several RDF knowledge bases are available through the LOD initiative, the ontology scheme of such linked datasets is not very rich.

To this end, we have developed a system, DART, whose functioning combines contextual similarity checking and paraphrase recognition techniques into a unified framework for discovering new relationships from web patterns. DART then attempts to ground the discovered relationships in the linked data set to discard irrelevant relationships and identify new relationships. The fully automated grounding method proposed in this paper also generates future property axioms for enriching the linked data sets. The results collected reveal the potential of DART to uncover many interesting relationships between a given class pair, leading to the growth of a relationship-rich LOD. DART surpasses the state-of-the-art system in terms of validity and number of relationships. As part of our future work, we intend to improve the exploration validation and validation methods for their validation."}], "references": [{"title": "Extending the Coverage of DBpedia Properties using Distant Supervision over Wikipedia", "author": ["Alessio Palmero Aprosio", "ClaudioGiuliano", "Alberto Lavelli"], "venue": "In NLP-DBPEDIA@ISWC (CEUR Workshop Proceedings),", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction Using Ontology Class Hierarchy-Based Features", "author": ["PedroH.R.

LOD initiative, the ontology schema of such linked datasets is not very rich. In particular, they lack object properties. The problem of finding new object properties (and their instances) between any two given classes has not been investigated in detail in the context of Linked Data. In this paper, we present DART (Detecting ArbitraryRelations for enriching T-Boxes of Linked Data) an unsupervised solution to enrich the LOD cloud with new object properties between two given classes. DART exploits contextual similarity to identify text patterns from the web corpus that can potentially represent relations between individuals. These text patterns are then clustered by means of paraphrase detection to capture the object properties between the two given LOD classes. DART also performs fully automated mapping of the discovered relations to the properties in the linked dataset. This serves many purposes such as identification of completely new relations, elimination of irrelevant relations, and generation of prospective property axioms. We have empirically evaluated our approach on several pairs of classes and found that the system can indeed be used for enriching the linked datasets with new object properties and their instances. We compared DART with newOntExt system which is an offshoot of the NELL (Never-Ending Language Learning) effort. Our experiments reveal that DART gives better results than newOntExt with respect to both the correctness, as well as the number of relations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
