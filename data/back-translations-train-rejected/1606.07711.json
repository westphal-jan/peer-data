Introduction", "text": "It has been a central theme of this discipline since the beginnings of Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Weaver et al. 2005) and today it is still a central theme of this discipline. This is because it is important for many NLP tasks such as text understanding (Kilgarriff 1997), text development (Dagan and Glickman 2004), opinion forming (Smr\u017e 2006), sensations (Rentoumi et al. 2009) and information gathering (Zhong and Ng 2012). All these applications can benefit from the disambiguization of ambiguous words as a preliminary process; otherwise they remain on the surface of the word, affecting the coherence of the data to be analyzed (Pantel and Lin 2002)."}, {"heading": "2.

Word Sense Disambiguation as a Consistent Labeling Problem", "text": "WSD can be interpreted as a meaning-marking task (Navigli 2009), which consists in assigning a meaning-marking task to a target word. As a marking problem, we need an algorithm that fulfils this task in a consistent way, taking into account the context in which the target word occurs. Following this observation, we can formulate the WSD task as a problem of satisfaction limitation (Tsang 1995), in which the marking process must fulfil some constraints in order to be consistent. This approach gives us the opportunity not only to exploit the contextual information of a word, but also to find the most appropriate meaning association for the target word and the words in its context. This is the most important contribution of our work that distinguishes it from existing WSD algorithms. In fact, in some cases we only use contextual information without imposing consistencies that can lead to inconsistencies in the assignment of related words."}, {"heading": "4.

It was introduced by Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) to develop a mathematical framework capable of modelling the fundamentals of decision-making in interactive situations. In its normal form, it represents strategies we use in this article. It consists of a finite group of players I = {1,.., n}, a set of pure strategies for each player Si = {s1,..., sm}, and a utility function ui: S1 \u00d7 Sn \u2192 R, which associates strategies to payouts. Any player can adopt a strategy to play a game, and the utility function depends on the combination of strategies played simultaneously by players who are not only involved in the strategy of a single player. An important assumption in game theory is that players are rational and try to maximize the value of the strategy."}, {"heading": "4.2 Evolutionary Game Theory", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

Players can choose a specific strategy from among the strategies Si = {1,..., c}, each expressing a specific hypothesis about their class affiliation and c being the total number of classes available. We consider Si to be the mixed strategy for player i as in Section 4. The games are played between two similar words, i and j, and only imply interaction between them in pairs. The Zij payout matrix of a single game is defined as a meaningful similarity matrix between the senses of the word i and the word j. The payout function for each word is additive separable and is calculated as described in Section 4.2.1, the problem being formulated in this way is not equivalent."}, {"heading": "5.1 Implementation of the WSD Games", "text": "This year, it is time for us to be able to move into a new world, in which we are able to understand the world and in which we are able to create a new world."}, {"heading": "5.2 Implementation Details", "text": "In this context, it is also worth mentioning the fact that both are \"very strange\" situations, in which it is a \"very strange\" situation, in which it is a \"very strange\" situation. \"It is a very strange situation,\" he says, \"but it is a very strange situation.\" \"It is a very strange situation,\" he says, \"but it is a very strange situation.\" \"It is not as if such a situation would occur,\" he says, he says, \"but it is a very strange situation.\""}, {"heading": "5.3 An example", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it can only take one year to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution."}, {"heading": "6.

Conclusions", "text": "In this article we have introduced a new method for WSD based on game theory. We have given a comprehensive introduction to the WSD task and explained the motivations behind the choice to model the WSD problem as a satisfaction problem. We have conducted an extensive series of experiments to find the similarity measures that work better within our framework. We have also evaluated our system with two different implementations and compared our results with the most advanced systems. Our method can be considered a continuation of the knowledge based on approaches. We have combined and compared the methodology of these three approaches. This model is used to perform a consistent labeling of the senses."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the Samsung Global Research Outreach Program.
