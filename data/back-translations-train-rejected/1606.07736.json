There is considerable interest in evaluating VSMs without having to embed them in a full NLP system. Such an intrinsic evaluation strategy, which has gained popularity in recent years, uses the offset approach to solving word analogy problems (Levy and Goldberg, 2014; Mikolov et al., 2013a; Turney, 2012). This method assesses whether a linguistic relationship - for example, between the base and the rounded form of a verb (debugging and debugging) - is consistently encoded as a specific linear offset in space. If this is the case, estimating the offset using a word pair that is related in a particular way: We should place the displacement of words that relate in a particular way between other word pairs - and, for example, going out and rhyphenating."}, {"heading": "2 Analogy functions", "text": "x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x,"}, {"heading": "3 Experimental setup", "text": "Analogy problems: We use the analogy data set proposed by Mikolov et al.

A number of these categories, sometimes referred to as \"syntactic,\" test whether the structure of space captures simple morphological relationships, such as the relationship between the base and the linear form of a verb (screaming: screaming). Others evaluate the knowledge that space encodes the world, e.g. the relationship between a country and its currency (latvia: latvia latvia). A last category that does not fit neatly into one of these groups is the relationship between the base and the linear form of a verb (screaming: screaming).

This variability crosses the difference between world knowledge and morphological categories; performance in currencies and adjectives-to-adverbs was poor, while performance was high in capitals and comparatives. Although ADD and MULTIPLY always outperformed accuracy in baselines, the margin differed in the various categories. The most striking case is the plural category in which the accuracy of ONLY-B. 70, and even ADD-OPPOSITE achieved reasonable accuracy (.45)."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "The success of the offset method in solving word analogy problems was assumed to indicate that systematic relationships between words in space are represented as consistent vector offsets (Mikolov et al., 2013c).The current note examined potential difficulties with this interpretation, but a literal (\"vanilla\") implementation of the method did not accomplish the task: the nearest neighbor of an economy \u2212 a + b was almost always b or an economy. Even if these candidates were excluded, part of the success of the analogy could also be achieved by baselines ignoring one or even both and an economy. Finally, reversing the direction of the analogy significantly impaired accuracy, even if the same offset was involved in both directions. Baseline performance varied far beyond analogy categories. Baseline performance was poor in the adjective-to-superlative relationship and was very high in the plural category."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "I thank Ewan Dunbar, Emmanuel Dupoux, Omer Levy and Benjamin Spector for their comments and discussions.
