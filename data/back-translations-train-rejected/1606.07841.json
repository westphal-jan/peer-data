Here both the quality of the decisions and the ease of making them are enhanced. In this regard, we propose a PDS framework, named RADAR, based on the research in Automated Planning in AI, that aids the human decision maker with her plan to achieve her goals by providing alerts on: whether such a plan can succeed at all, whether there exist any resource constraints that may foil her plan, etc. This is achieved by generating and analyzing the landmarks that must be accomplished by any successful plan on the way to achieving the goals. Note that, this approach also supports naturalistic decision making which is being acknowledged as a necessary element in proactive decision support, since it only aids the human decision maker through suggestions and alerts rather than enforcing fixed plans or decisions.

Systems that do not support naturalistic decision-making have adverse effects on workflows that cause frustration among decision-makers (Feigh et al., 2007). In (Parasuraman et al., 2000) a study on the consequences of human performance at different levels and types of automation is provided, in which aspects such as mental workload and situational awareness are considered as evaluation criteria. (Parasuraman et al., 2000) A model for types and levels of automation that provides an objective basis for deciding which system functions to automate shows that human use of automation can lead to distortions and commission errors, underlining the importance of reliability of automation (Parasuraman et, 1997, and Parasuran al, 2008) that different elements of human interaction are observed in the context."}, {"heading": "PROPOSED PROACTIVE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM: RADAR", "text": "Now we will briefly present the proposed Proactive Decision Support System (PDS) - RADAR, based on automated planning technologies. First, we will introduce the various elements of the PDS system and then briefly present the details of the methodology behind the creation of proposals and warnings. The various elements of the Planning PDS system are: \u2022 Tasks / Goals: The tasks or goals that need to be achieved clearly represent an important and necessary element. \u2022 State / Context, Resources: The current state or context is needed for the PDS system to generate relevant warnings. Resource availability is also part of the context that we separately point out as an important part of the context. \u2022 Model, Measures / Decisions: The model consists of rules that are applicable in the world in which the plan is being executed. Measures are, for example, part of a model that provides information about when a particular measure is applicable (which are the conditions that need to be met in order for the current state to be achieved), what impact that measure may have."}, {"heading": "Generating Suggestions and Alerts (PDS)", "text": "Since the boundary stones are the states that need to be visited in order to achieve the objectives, if there is no way to reach a particular boundary, the system can generate an alarm that signals that the target cannot be achieved, perhaps because there are no measures available to help with the visit to the boundary in question, or because the conditions for measures that can help to reach the boundary are not met. In some cases, the conditions that are not currently met for a measure to be applicable may be due to resource constraints. In such cases, the system instead generates a suggestion that these resources are needed to accomplish the task."}, {"heading": "Case Study: Fire-fighting Domain", "text": "Most of them are not able to save themselves, most of them are able to save themselves, most of them are able to save themselves, most of them are able to save themselves, most of them are not able to save themselves, most of them are not able to save themselves, most of them are not able to save themselves, most of them are not able to save themselves, most of them are not able to save themselves, most of them are not able to save themselves, most of them are not able to save themselves, most of them are not able to save themselves, most of them are not able to save themselves, most of them are not able to save themselves."}, {"heading": "EVALUATIONS WITH HUMANS ON UTILITY", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to be able to try to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "We presented a Proactive Decision Support Framework (PDS) called RADAR, which is based on research on automated planning in the field of artificial intelligence and supports the human decision maker in her plan to achieve her goals by providing warnings and suggestions on possible drawbacks in the plan and resource constraints, by identifying and analysing the milestones that a successful plan needs to achieve before the goals are achieved.
