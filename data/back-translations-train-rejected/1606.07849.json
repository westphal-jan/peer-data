Unsurprisingly, there is a growing interest in developing automatic methods for summarizing meetings (e.g. Zechner (2002), Maskey and Hirschberg (2005), Lin and Chen (2010), Murray et al.).

In addition, they evaluate their system."}, {"heading": "3 Focused Summarization as Relation Extraction", "text": "Given the DRDAs for each meeting grouped (not necessarily correctly) according to the decisions they support, we place each cluster of DRDAs (ordered by time within the cluster) into a \"decision document.\" The goal will be to create a decision abstract for each such decision document. We will obtain constituent and dependent analyses using the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003; de Marneffe et al., 2006). Using the corpus of constituent-based decision documents as input, we will use and modify the system of Chen et al. (2011) to identify decision criteria and decision content relationships for each cluster. 4 (Section 6 will clarify how the learned decision criteria are used to identify decision content relationships.)

(2011) probabilistic relationship learning model used for both Decision Cue and Decision Content Relationship Extraction. The parameter estimation and constraint encoding through posterior inference are presented in Section 5. The relationship learning model takes as input clusters of DRDAs, sorted by time of expression and concatenated in a decision document. We assume that one decision is made per document. The aim of the model is to explain how the decision documents are generated from the latent relation variables. The downstream regulation technique (Section 5) tends to draw conclusions about the declarative limitations of relation instances. Instead of strictly extracting relation instances, features and constraints are designed in such a way that the model detects various relationship types and ensures that the identified relation instances are coherent and significant."}, {"heading": "5 Parameter Estimation and Inference via Posterior Regularization", "text": "In order to determine global preferences for the relative instances (e.g. the syntactic structure of the expressions), we set expectations for posterior distributions during the inference to limit inequality (Graca et al., 2008)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Variational inference with Constraints", "text": "Suppose we are interested in estimating the posterior distribution p (\u03b8, z | x) of a model q q in general, in which the CLL divergence to the true posterior LL (\u03b8, z) and the latent variables and observations are to be estimated. (1) A mid-range assumption is made for variable inference, where q (\u03b8, z) = q (\u03b8, z) q (z) is minimized. Then, we can minimize Equation 1 by performing the coordinate deviation from q (\u03b8, z) and q (z). Now, we intend to have a finite control over the posterior regions to induce meaningful semantic parts. For example, we would like most of the extracted relation cases to be instances to satisfy a set of predefined syntactic patterns z.

For each type of relationship, we need at least 80% 5 of the induced relationship instances in the expectation of corresponding to one of the following syntactic patterns: \u2022 The indicator is a verb and the argument is a noun phrase. The keyword of the argument is the direct object of the indicator or the nominal subject of the indicator in the expectation that this threshold is suitable for decision relationship, so we take it out (Chen et al., 2011).

If we use the standout relation messages identified by GRE as summaries, the ROUGE results will be significantly more powerful than the second, so we will only list the best results for their system in this paper.
