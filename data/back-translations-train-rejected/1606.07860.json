Independently of formal semantics, healthy spatio-linguistic abstractions provide a human-centered and cognitively adequate mechanism for logical-automated reasoning about spatio-temporal information (Bhatt et al. 2013).Research in qualitative spatial representation and reasoning has been driven primarily by the use of relative algebraic semantics."}, {"heading": "3 ANSWER SET PROGRAMMING MODULO THEORIES", "text": "The semantics of stable models is the most widely used theory of non-monotonous thinking with important practical applications. It is able to express a number of non-monotonous and standard types of argumentation, e.g. causal effects of actions, a lack of information and various assumptions of completeness (e.g. the absence of ramifications resulting in state restrictions) (Gelfond 2008), which makes it very attractive for thinking about space, actions and change in an integrated way. In the following, we present a definition of stable models based on syntactical transformations (Bartholomew and Lee 2012), which represents a generalization of earlier definitions from (Ferraris et al. 2011), (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988) and (Ferraris 2005)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Bartholomew \u2013 Lee Functional Stable Model Semantics", "text": "For predicate symbols (constants or variables) u and c, if u and c are predicate symbols, and for the expression x (u (x) = c (x)), if they are function symbols.

Then, the SMT problem is to check whether a given first order formula, i.e., with a model that extends the background theory. ASPMT is a generalization of ASP analogous to a generalization of SAT that works with SMT (the syntax of ASPMT is the same as the syntax of SMT).It is shown in (Bartholomew and Lee 2013) that a narrow portion of ASPMT instances can be converted into SMT instances and, as a result, off-the-shelf SMT solvers (e.g. Z3 (De Moura and Bj\u00f8rner 2008) can be used for arithmetic superreals to compile stable models of ASP."}, {"heading": "4.1 The Qualitative Spatial Domain QS", "text": "Qualitative spatial calculations can be divided into two groups: topological and position calculations. With topological calculations such as the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) (Randell et al. 1992), the primitive units are spatially extended spatial regions and could possibly even be spatio-temporal 4D histories, e.g. for motion pattern analysis. Alternatively, point-based abstractions with orientation calculations can suffice within a dynamic range comprising translational movements (e.g. using the Oriented-Point Relation Algebra (OPRAm) (Moratz 2006).

Theory is based on a single connectivity predicate C (x, y) interpreted as topological closures of regions x and y that have at least one common point (i.e. the regions touch each other at their boundaries or their interiors).The system consists of an additional module for spatial thinking and Z3 as an SMT solver.

OUTLOOK", "text": "We have presented ASPMT (QS), a novel approach to arguing about space and spatial changes within a KR paradigm. By integrating dynamic spatial reasoning within a KR framework, namely responses to programming (module theories), our system can be used to model behavioral patterns that characterize high-level processes, events, and activities as identifiable in terms of a general characterization of common sense in terms of space, actions, and change (Bhatt 2012; Bhatt and Loke 2008). ASPMT (QS) is able to develop a solid and complete spatial reasoning, and to combine qualitative and quantitative spatial information if they do not argue monotonically; this is due to the approach of coding spatial relations as polynomial constraints, and the solution with SMT solvers for the theory of real nonlinear arithmetics."}], "references": [{"title": "Handbook of Spatial Logics", "author": ["M.
