The CMU pronouncing dictionary is used to count syllables of words that fill this structure.4 Wikipedia provides a generic text corpus that we used to generate n grammars, with more frequent constructions in haikus.5 The Wikipedia data was also processed with GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) to create a semantic vector space model of topics based on word collisions. 6 In short: 1. Haiku corpus \u2192 POS tagger \u2192 grammatical skeleton fragments. 2. General text corpus \u2192 n grammar model. 3. General text corpus \u2192 theme vectors. 4. Combine skeleton fragments to make aikhau template 5. syllable slots."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "\"I\" n, \"the author continued,\" is a nei. \"D\" u \"i\" n \"i.\" D \"i\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \"u\" u \""}, {"heading": "6 Discussion and Related Work", "text": "Towards automated evaluation Some of the evaluation dimensions are built into the way the poems are constructed. As mentioned above, form is explicitly considered for haikus. To a certain extent are also sense and thema.Sense: we have a n-gram model of text probability, which gives a higher score for constructions that are frequently observed phrases.Topic: we have a vector model of the subject word (s), and can determine the distance to the vector given by the sum of words in the poem. Results could certainly be improved in this regard: further, compared to a single haiku, our rengas ask for a much more interpolation of meaning on the reader's side. Questions with form re-emerge here: our generated rengas does not meet the classical constraints. Results should be with the addition of \"audio equaliser style\" parameters such as priority, dither and saturation."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In terms of Ventura's hierarchy of creative levels, the haiku system seems to be in the \"generalization phase.\" Our Renga writing experiments with FloWr brought with them a \"filtration aspect.\" The research topics discussed above point to a direction for future work in terms of the stages of \"foundation\" and \"creativity.\""}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This research was supported by the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) programme of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission under the FET Open Grant number 611553 (COINVENT)."}], "references": [{"title": "Automated haiku generation based on word vector models", "author": ["Alham Fikri Aji"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Aji.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Aji.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Robert Zimmer", "author": ["Mohammad Ali Javaheri Javid", "Tim Blackwell"], "venue": "and Mohammad Majid al Rifaie.", "citeRegEx": "Ali Javaheri Javid et al.2016", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2016}, {"title": "Maria Teresa Llano", "author": ["John Charnley", "Simon Colton"], "venue": "and Joseph Corneli.", "citeRegEx": "Charnley et al.2016", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2016}, {"title": "Simon Colton", "author": ["Joseph Corneli", "Anna Jordanous", "Rosie Shepperd", "Maria Teresa Llano", "Joanna Misztal"], "venue": "and Christian Guckelsberger.", "citeRegEx": "Corneli et al.2015", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2015}, {"title": "Lexical priming: A new theory of words and language", "author": ["Michael Hoey"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Hoey.,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Hoey.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "An evolutionary algorithm approach to poetry generation", "author": ["Hisar Maruli Manurung"], "venue": "Ph.D. thesis.
