Specifically, for both templates, we form two multicultural logistic regression classifiers for relationships that are based on one v.s. all strategies. Feature Design. Our features are based on standard lexical and flat syntactic characteristics (i.e. POS tags, dependency relationships) from literature. We also look at the words and their POS tags between the entity pairs or entity pairs. A gazetteer feature is constructed to indicate whether the sample is in freebase."}, {"heading": "3.1.

Formally, a search session S is represented by a sequence of units e0, e1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, el, as described in Section 2.2. We calculate the probability of the sessions on the basis of Markov models with different histories, the higher order model taking into account a longer history. The probability of the session S is expressed as the product of the units of which S is composed, where the probability of each unit depends on the previous n \u2212 1 units (i.e. order-n): P (S) = 1 P (ei | i \u2212 1 i \u2212 n + 1), where e j i denotes the sequence ei,..., ej.

Results: Entity and Relation Extraction", "text": "Due to the large size of the test data, we automatically acquire designations by comparing queries and units with names longer than two words in the Gazetteer. The resulting designations are taken as the gold standard for evaluation. As some of our classifier's predictions are outside the Gazetteer, underestimating accuracy, we only report callbacks to measure how many units or relationships are retrieved from the models. In the test phase, we assume that our models only have access to the part of the Gazetteer that has been observed in training. Compare. We compare 1) two baselines and 2) a linear CRF that predicts entity spans and their types simultaneously [13]. Baseline 1 (Gazetteer Only) is constructed by comparing the units in the Gazetteer with the queries, selecting the longest matching when a token is mapped to multiple units. For Baseline 2 (no session), we follow [25] to establish a significantly better relationship between the units in the query and the results."}, {"heading": "4.
