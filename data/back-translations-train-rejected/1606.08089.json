Here, we analyze causal precedence in the biomedical domain as distinct from open-domain, temporal precedence. First, we describe a novel, hand-annotated text corpus of causal precedence in the biomedical domain. Second, we use this corpus to investigate a battery of models of precedence, covering rule-based, feature-based, and latent representation models. The highest-performing individual model achieved a micro F1 of 43 points, approaching the best performers on the simpler temporal-only precedence tasks. Feature-based and latent representation models each outperform the rule-based models, but their performance is complementary to one another. We apply a sieve-based architecture to capitalize on this lack of overlap, achieving a micro F1 score of 46 points.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Jun 2016 21:55:40 GMT  (473kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08089v1", "To appear in the proceedings of the 2016 Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in the proceedings of the 2016 Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["gus hahn-powell", "dane bell", "marco a valenzuela-esc\\'arcega", "mihai surdeanu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08089"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.08089.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "This before That: Causal Precedence in the Biomedical Domain", "authors": ["Gus Hahn-Powell", "Dane Bell", "Marco A.

By combining the surface, syntactic, and taxonomic characteristics outlined in Table 3, we trained a number of statistical classifiers to detect causal precedent relationships between pairs of events in our corpus. For training and testing purposes, we treated as a negative example any instance that was not labeled \"E1 before E2\" or \"E2 before E1.\" We examined the following statistical models: a linear core SVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), logistic regression (Fan et al., 2008), and random forest9 (Surdeanu et al., 2014)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Latent Representation Models", "text": "In fact, we find ourselves able to stir and stir up the aforementioned brainlcsrc\u00fcehcS in order to stir them up."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "We summarize the performance of all these models on the dataset previously introduced in Table 4. We report on results with microprecision, recall and F1 scores for each model. With less than 200 cases of causal precedent occurring in 1000 annotations, training and testing was performed for both the label-based classifiers and for latent feature models with stratified 10-fold cross-validation. For the latent feature models, training was parameterized to a maximum of 100. Furthermore, the binding of nucleotide-free Ras to PI3KC2\u03b2 inhibits its lipid kinase activity. PI3KC2\u03b2 and Ras complexes can then be transferred to distal sites, such as early endosomes (EE), where ITSN1 then binds to PI3KC2\u03b2, resulting in the release of nucleotide-free Ras and the activation of lipid kinase activity."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "Overall, the results are promising, especially in light of the deliberate decision to omit (causal) regulatory responses in this task, since they are already covered by the reach reading system. However, the deterministic models created so far remember extremely little, making it difficult to determine their accuracy. An analysis of the Reichenbach model reveals a source of this limited reach. In short, although authors could describe causal mechanisms using temporal indicators such as tension and aspect, a temporal description in this area is rare enough not to be represented in our randomly sampled database. Table 5 illustrates the lack of overlap with informative time aspect combinations; a single tense is used per pass, and no perfect aspect is used. Likewise, the time expressions required by the deterministic precedent rules within and between sentences are rare enough to render them ineffective in this sample."}, {"heading": "5.1 Model overlap", "text": "As Chambers et al. (2014), Mirza (2016) and many other algorithms have shown, models can be applied sequentially in \"sevens\" to achieve higher quality results. Ideally, each model in a sieve-based system captures different portions of the data through a mixture of approaches, making this method different from more naive ensembles in which the contributions of a single component would be washed out.

At this point, we limit our discussion to the most prominent feature shared by the majority of false positives. Discourse information More than half of the false positions have contrastive discourse features that indicate that a discourse model could improve discrimination against classifiers. Example 8 shows such a contrasting structure in which a clause (and an event) is introduced that is contrastive and therefore both temporally and causally distinguishable from the following clause (and the event)."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "Although they focused on the temporal order, Chambers et al. (2014) adopted a seven-based approach, with high-precision deterministic sieves preceding and limiting more precise, precise machine-learning sieves. As with our system, deterministic sieves were linguistically motivated and had the added advantage of using expressions over time (during, on Friday, etc.), as well as events that are typically absent from the biomedical domain. Mirza (2016) implemented a hybrid seven-based approach to detecting causal relationships between events, including a set of causal verbal rules and corresponding syntactic dependencies, as well as a label-based classic. However, both work focus on open-domain texts. To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate causal precedent cases in the biomedical domain."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "These are the first experiments on the automatic annotation of causal precedents in the biomedical field. Although the lack of temporal expressions and other regular linguistic cues makes the task particularly difficult in this area, the initial results are promising and show that a seven-based system of models tested here improves performance over the most powerful single component. Both the annotation corpus and the models described here represent major steps towards linking automatic reading with a larger, more informative biological mechanism."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under the ARO contract W911NF-141-0395."}], "references": [{"title": "An investigation of coreference phenomena in the biomedical domain", "author": ["Dane Bell", "Gus Hahn-Powell", "Marco A.

Here, we analyze causal precedence in the biomedical domain as distinct from open-domain, temporal precedence. First, we describe a novel, hand-annotated text corpus of causal precedence in the biomedical domain. Second, we use this corpus to investigate a battery of models of precedence, covering rule-based, feature-based, and latent representation models. The highestperforming individual model achieved a micro F1 of 43 points, approaching the best performers on the simpler temporalonly precedence tasks. Feature-based and latent representation models each outperform the rule-based models, but their performance is complementary to one another. We apply a sieve-based architecture to capitalize on this lack of overlap, achieving a micro F1 score of 46 points.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
