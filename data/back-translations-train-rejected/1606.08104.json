For example, n = 1 P1 = (ABA) and n = 2 corresponds to P2 = (ABABA). It is easy to verify the symmetry of Pn and thus apply PathSim. The corresponding pendulum matrix for Pn is M = (WABWBA) n and consequently the similarity between item i and item j can be calculated by equation (1). Suppose we define N meta path P1, P2,.., PN, with the corresponding similarities s1, s2,..., sN, the total similarity should be measured as a weighted aggregation, e.g. s = N = 1: metn = 1. As suggested in [18], the length of the element is relatively long enough to measure S2p."}, {"heading": "4 Optimizing Profile Similarity", "text": "Before the discussion, we first listed the notations used in this section in Table 1. Note that vectors and matrices are made bold. Each profile contains rich text to describe the attribute. Therefore, more effective methods of content analysis and measures of text similarity are crucial for the recommendation. Most designed text similarity recommendation systems measure the cosinal similarity of two terms, with each word weighted by tf \u00b7 idf [2,17]. Nevertheless, it is possible to go beyond the definition of tf \u00b7 idf, where tf represents the local term weight and idf the global term weight. While tf could be derived offline using different methods, idf requires further optimization, as suggested by [9]. Thus, the global term could be optimized with the guidance of PathSim and the similarity of the vector."}, {"heading": "4.1 Squared Error Loss Function", "text": "In this section, the loss function could be defined as the quadratic error that could optimize the global event frequency: min wJ = 12% Sf \u2212 Sp \u2212 2F + 2% Sp \u2212 Sp \u2212 2F + 2% Sp \u2212 2F, where the np \u2212 2F is, on which we could optimize the global event frequency: min wJ = 12% Sf \u2212 Sp \u2212 2F + 2% Sp \u2212 2F, where the np \u2212 2F is, which is actually the squared sum of all elements of the matrix. w stands for the vector of the wk, and we penalize 2% Sp."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Evaluation", "text": "In order to evaluate the method we have proposed, extensive experiments have been carried out, which, however, we present only partially due to space constraints."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experiment Setup", "text": "The results reported in this section are based on the NIPS dataset2. It contains paper-author and paper-word matrices extracted from the co-author network at the NIPS conference over 13 volumes. We consider authors as users, papers as items, and the contents of papers as items. Thus, the data has 2037 users (authors) and 1740 items (papers), where 13649 words were extracted from the corpus of item profiles. The contents of the papers are pre-processed in such a way that all words are converted into lowercase letters and stopped words are removed. It can be noted that the NIPS dataset is very sparse, which means that some authors can publish only one or two items, demonstrating the importance of proper use of page information for recommendations. We have used 5 times Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOCV) to evaluate our proposed method."}, {"heading": "5.2 Effect of Initial Value", "text": "First, we evaluate the impact of the initial value we set for global weights on the performance.

The result is shown in Figure 1, which shows the superiority of idf over chance. The result demonstrates the usefulness of ancillary information in this dataset and we then set the initial value of the global term as idf."}, {"heading": "5.3 Effect of Parameters", "text": "In this set of experiments, the validation is performed to select the most appropriate parameters. \u03bb varies from 0 to 0.05 and grades 0.005 and np is set to 1.2.3. we draw the lines in Figure 2. three lines are drawn to distinguish between np = 1 (red line), np = 2 (blue line) and np = 3 (green line), respectively.

Since Figure 2 represents the performance along with the procedure, we find the best value as 0.01 for np = 1, 0.02 for np = 1 and 0.025 for 3. We increase the performance of 00p = while we have shown that 001 is more robust than 0.001 for preceding."}, {"heading": "5.5 Comparison of Algorithms", "text": "Since the Top-N recommendation methods have been extensively studied, we only compare our method with some state-of-the-art methods, e.g. Slim [13] and LCE [17]. We also include the pure tfidf method to calculate the item similarity for the recommendation. To distinguish, we call our proposed method crap (meta-path-based item similarity to learn global term weights). We present the result in Figure 4, where all the comparative algorithms have been optimized for the best settings. Figure 4 (a) shows that the recommendation of crap is consistently better than the other three methods. Note that Slim performs worst, due to the scarcity of the data set. LCE also used Item profile and has thus achieved good performance. It is also worth noting that the pure tfidf has relatively acceptable results and crap as the collaborative optimized tfid.If it holds up well to the structural results (Figure 4), HARb also holds up well."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a content-based Top-N recommendation system by using item profiles. First, we used PathSim to measure item similarity on top of heterogeneous relationships between users and items, and then optimized the global term weights towards the similarities of PathSim. To facilitate training, the derivative was reformulated into a matrix form that could easily be parallel. We conducted extensive experiments, and the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method."}], "references": [{"title": "Fab: content-based, collaborative recommendation", "author": ["M.
