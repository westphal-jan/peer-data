Is there any scientific way to understand the origin of this mysterious force that drives the behavior of even the stupidest naturally intelligent systems and is completely absent in their smartest artificial analogs? Can we build AI systems that could be curious about something, systems that would have an intrinsic motivation to learn? Is such a motivation quantifiable? Is it implementable? I will discuss this problem from the standpoint of physics. The relationship between physics and intelligence is a consequence of the fact that correctly predicted information is nothing but an energy resource, and the process of thinking can be viewed as a process of accumulating and spending this resource through the acts of perception and, respectively, decision making. The natural motivation of any autonomous system to keep this accumulation/spending balance as high as possible allows one to treat the problem of describing the dynamics of thinking processes as a resource optimization problem. Here I will propose and discuss a simple theoretical model of such an autonomous system which I call the Autonomous Turing Machine (ATM). The potential attractiveness of ATM lies in the fact that it is the model of a self-propelled AI for which the only available energy resource is the information itself. For ATM, the problem of optimal thinking, learning, and decision-making becomes conceptually simple and mathematically well tractable. This circumstance makes the ATM an ideal playground for studying the dynamics of intelligent behavior and allows one to quantify many seemingly unquantifiable features of genuine intelligence.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 01:53:02 GMT  (1649kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08109v1", "79 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "79 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alex ushveridze"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08109"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.08109.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Three informal lectures on physics of intelligence", "authors": ["Alex Ushveridze"], "emails": ["alex.ushveridze@capella.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of us are able to orient ourselves in a different direction than in a different direction, that is, in the direction in which they are moving.

They can perform complex tasks, learn quickly, outperform humans in many areas and even pass Turing test3. Tomorrow's AI system will likely look smarter4. Enormous progress in this direction is actually spurred by impressive advances in the field of \"deep learning\" with all its sub-areas such as sparse auto-encoders, limited machines and other things. The concept of an auto-encoder - a learning machine that first codes (compresses) external information and then decodes (decompresses) it attempts to reproduce its original version - proved to be extremely fruitful. There are at least three reasons for this. Firstly, from an architectural point of view, the auto-encoder is universal and can be applied to all data. Secondly, it needs a supervisor and lies in the background of truly autonomous AI systems."}, {"heading": "1.1.

All we have to do now is to make the same movement every time we gain access to a new cylinder: simply move the diaphragm from the old position 1 to the new position 1 without opening it, as shown in the figure below: Here, the colored vertical lines represent the initial (red) and final (green) positions of a diaphragm.

The evolutionary operator describes calculations, it is uniform and does not lead to loss of information. Its only meaning (for us) is to prepare the state for energy extraction, and this is the main reason why we need calculations. The operator responsible for energy extraction is not uniform and leads to complete loss of information. In the language of quantum mechanics, we can say that the state vector collapses. This formalism reveals striking similarities with mathematical formalities of quantum mechanics, especially with its path-integral formulation.

Second, it plays a unifying role in physics that reveals startling similarities between its seemingly unrelated branches. Overall, the development of physics in the 20th century was driven only by these two trends of abstraction and unification, the first of which led to an enormous number of models - the idealized mathematical structures that allow one to isolate the most important features of complex systems and study them in a relatively simple way. The latter essentially allowed similarities between these systems to be found and merged, thereby unifying our knowledge of nature. The main distinguishing feature of all of these models - both intermedial and final - was that they were incredibly simple and incredibly rich at the same time. The most impressive achievement of this combined modeling theory and the creation of unification forces (the great forces of unification) in the UT was that all of unification forces were at the core of unification."}, {"heading": "Is the phenomenon of intelligence complex or simple?", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to be able to try to find a solution that we are able to find, where we have to try to find a solution."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "I would be very grateful for comments and feedback."}], "references": [{"title": "Game of Life Cellular Automata. s.l.:Springer", "author": ["Adamatzky", "A. e"], "venue": "The Use of Information Theory in Evolutionary Biology.

Is there any scientific way to understand the origin of this mysterious force that drives the behavior of even the \u201cstupidest\u201d naturally intelligent systems and is completely absent in their \u201csmartest\u201d artificial analogs? Can we build AI systems that could be curious about something, systems that would have an intrinsic motivation to learn? Is such a motivation quantifiable? Is it implementable? Will we ever see artificially built systems having their views, values or goals? Or maybe the only mission of AI is to imitate intelligence, fool Turing test judges and build next-generation gadgets? These are the main questions I will try to address here, in these lectures. I will discuss this problem from the standpoint of physics. Treating intelligence as a physical phenomenon will not only allow us to understand what its driving force is, but will also give us a powerful formalism capable of studying it mathematically in a systematic and unified way. The relationship between physics and intelligence is a consequence of the fact that \u201ccorrectly predicted information\u201d is nothing but an energy resource, and the process of thinking can be viewed as a process of accumulating and spending this resource through the acts of perception and, respectively, decision making. The natural motivation of any autonomous system to keep this accumulation/spending balance as high as possible allows one to treat the problem of describing the dynamics of thinking processes as a resource optimization problem. Here I will propose and discuss a simple theoretical model of such an autonomous system which I call the Autonomous Turing Machine (ATM). The potential attractiveness of ATM lies in the fact that it is the model of a self-propelled AI for which the only available energy resource is the information itself. For ATM, the problem of optimal thinking, learning, and decision-making becomes conceptually simple and mathematically well tractable. This circumstance makes the ATM an ideal playground for studying the dynamics of intelligent behavior and allows one to quantify many seemingly unquantifiable features of genuine intelligence. A closer look at this subject reveals its cross-disciplinary nature: it turns out that there are many striking parallels between diverse branches of artificial intelligence on the one hand and theoretical physics and business economics on the other hand. For this reason, I wanted to target this text to a maximally broad audience, including physicists, computer scientists, business analysts and philosophers of science. I hope that this explains its somewhat informal and not quite academic style and also a relatively high-level character of references. 1 Email: alex.ushveridze@capella.edu", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
