The latter seem to give more insights. They have the form of the announcement models in the announcement logic, and in fact we have seen that valid true lies come with strong syntactical limitations. In the private lie example, we have also modeled actions that involve factual changes.

The investigation can be considered an obvious next step in the light of existing in-depth investigations of successful and self-refutable updates of the agents \"knowledge, i.e. models that interpret epistemic attitudes with equivalence relationships. We have applied this not only to the KD45 models for believing agents, but also to models without structural properties. Then, two new types of updates come to the fore: true lies (which come true after a lie announcement) and impossible lies (which remain false even after a lie announcement) and iterations of such announcements. An open question about these iterations is what are usually valid formulas realizable."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Yanjing Wang would like to thank Ce'dric De'gremont and Andreas Witzel for discussing the example in Section 7, and he would like to thank them for their support through the National Program for Special Support of Outstanding Professionals.

In that logic, we can call an announcement a lie if the announced formula is false. A true lie is then the announcement of something false that makes it true. This analysis of a lie is not entirely according to the traditional view of agents lying to each other: you are lying to me if you believe \u00ac\u03c6 but you say to me that \u03c6 with the intention to make me believe that \u03c6. If we model the realization of this intention (namely that indeed I believe you), and incorporate all belief aspects, we get \u2737a\u00ac\u03c6\u2192 [\u2737a\u03c6]\u2737b\u2737a\u03c6 (where agent a lies to agent b). Abstracting from all belief aspects gives us \u00ac\u03c6 \u2192 [\u03c6]\u03c6. Although the former is more precise, it is not uncommon, if not customary, to abstract from the source and the justification of the lie so that we get \u00ac\u03c6 \u2192 [\u03c6]\u2737b\u03c6, from where it is not a big step to \u00ac\u03c6 \u2192 [\u03c6]\u03c6, the main focus of our investigation. (In order to make this identification, we can think of agent b as the special agent who is able to distinguish all states, for whom it holds that \u2737b\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c6.) This simplied schema \u00ac\u03c6 \u2192 [\u03c6]\u03c6 is clearly in opposition to the schema \u03c6 \u2192 [\u03c6]\u03c6 for the so-called successful formulas. (In truthful public announcement logic the successful formulas are those for which [\u03c6]\u03c6 is valid. In that logic [\u03c6]\u03c6 is equivalent to \u03c6 \u2192 [\u03c6]\u03c6. But in believed public announcement logic, where announcements are independent of the truth of the announced formula, [\u03c6]\u03c6 is not equivalent to \u03c6 \u2192 [\u03c6]\u03c6.) In this work we mainly investigate true lies, successful formulas, and yet other notions in believed announcement logic, and also the iteration of such announcements. We also present results in this work that are not for believed announcement logic, but that are still related to iterated announcements, or to lying. In the logic of believed public announcements, interpreted on KD45 models encoding belief, the announced formula can be false and true before the announcement and can also be false and true after the announcement; and even beyond that, when iterating that same announcement, this value can change in arbitrary ways after each next announcement. In This analysis of lying goes back to Augustine (1988).
