Motivated by the use cases where there is a large budget of identical positions, a generalization of submodular optimization to integer grids is proposed by [6]. Previously, submodular functions were generalized to grids across the grid of submodular properties. A function f: ZE + \u2192 R + is a reduction of grids of submodular if for all x, y: Z E + f (x) + f (y) modular constellation of modules (x).

This problem has been taken into account in [7] (in fact, a more general setting is even taken into account where c is a subadditive function), but there is an error in the proof. [7, Claim 5.2] uses the equality f (x) = f (xL), which is incorrect as it could happen that f (xL) > f (x \u0445) is an equality for the usual special case, where \u03b1 = maxx-P f (x), but not for the general case considered in [7].
