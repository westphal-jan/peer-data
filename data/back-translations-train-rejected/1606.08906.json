This more general idea is often captured under the term 'self-configuration'. Despite the importance of such capability, research work on this feature appears isolated by technical domains. It is not easy to tell quickly whether the approaches chosen in different technological domains introduce new ideas or whether the differences just reflect domain idiosyncrasies. For the sake of easy identification of key differences between systems with self-configuring capabilities, I will explore higher level concepts for understanding self-configuration, such as the {\\Omega}-units, in order to provide theoretical instruments for connecting different areas of technology and research.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 22:36:38 GMT  (5529kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08906v1", "46 pages, 62 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "46 pages, 62 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["aleksander lodwich"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08906"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.08906.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "1 Self-organization, structural stability and self-organization"}, {"heading": "Configuration", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "Frameworks", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into a different world, in which they are able to move, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in"}, {"heading": "Configurations", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to surpass themselves, to surpass themselves, to surpass themselves, to surpass themselves, to surpass themselves, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive, to survive."}, {"heading": "Configurations", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world in which they are able to live, in which they want to live."}, {"heading": "Space", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them will be able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves, and that they will be able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

The downside of this model lies in the way we can understand decision-making in the self-configuring system: With the help of eq. 4, the environment, the plant and the controller are all involved in \"decision-making\" by having a parametric function. I do not find it clarifying to have a set of functions that depend on magic properties of the input. Alternatively, the ji () function must classify the input in order to make a decision.

Mechanisms based on randomness may prevent the system from being repeatedly confronted with the same error that requires certain impasses. On the other hand, it may also prevent the reproduction of ideal system configurations. 4.2.3 Approaches based on MemoryA systems may lack an adequate mechanism for inferencing better configurations when faced with insufficient performance. However, it may simply remember configurations that were not necessarily optimal and that it accidentally found before. Memory can be used to easily restore the stored configurations and then allow the adjustment mechanisms to be optimized."}, {"heading": "Configuration", "text": "The configuration of the systems can be divided between several components. Depending on where certain functions have been assigned, we can distinguish several types of configurable systems (see Figure 39).When we speak of self-configurable systems, we usually imply self-3 capability.

However, the criterion for fragmentation of storage media is different from the plant: The amount of shared information (i.e. the commonality of information) in the configurations can be reduced. However, the rationale behind choosing such a criterion is the assumption that the environment and system state will evolve under some kind of inertia. In this case, configurations that are used in close proximity to time can significantly reduce the small number of bits required to achieve a new configuration, which is the smaller improvement because it is more likely that overwriting of the more common configuration parts is unavoidable (see Figure 44).An architectural model for this approach is shown in Figure 45: 6.4 Compressing the configuration as a means of optimizing bandwidth."}, {"heading": "Refactoring", "text": "\"Consider the uppermost behavior in Figure 52: It is a single plant configuration in the input (configuration) space and the plant produces a sequence of configurations in the output (configuration) space. However, given the mission of the workplace, the behavior produced (in this case a cyclic attractor) may be an approximation of an ideal behavior (fine line). If the system wanted to approximate the ideal behavior of the plant but is associated with a non-decompatible plant, then the approximation may be very limited. Imagine that the behavior can only be configured in terms of width, height and velocity. Now, the goal of refactoring is to gain additional configuration possibilities, which could be achieved by searching for piecewise functional substitutions (possibly approximations) of the original monolithic plant behavior as seen in the middle of Figure 52. This could be achieved by splitting the plant into four sections (and rationalization) of the bandwidth."}, {"heading": "Behavior", "text": "In theory, a system can not only be reconfigured for important events, but can also perform more frequent configuration updates, the reconfiguration then becomes an integral part of the behavior of a system. This means that the basic units of any dynamically developing (self) configurable system cannot be understood as its attainable static configurations. Figure 57 represents this idea and also shows bi-modal behavior and possible transitions between two behaviors (mode 1 & 2). Figure 57: Behavior as a history of reconfigurations. A system can have meta configurations that produce characteristic reconfiguration patterns (behaviors). This example shows how the design of mode switches can affect the performance of plants (edy)."}, {"heading": "Modes", "text": "It is not possible to clearly serve any hazardous conditions that must be performed with high reliability. The simpler the behavior, the more reliable it can be to re-evaluate the role of modal style, the more it may be that the reconfiguration processes are not considered an integral part of the system behavior (see fig. 47). However, I see other reasons to follow multimodal (\"jumpy\") reconfigurations: Consider the number 61 for a while, while the system behavior is defined in a hazardous configuration space.

adaptive in a more general sense. This more general idea is often captured under the term \u201cself-configuration\u201d. Despite the importance of such capability, research work on this feature appears isolated by technical domains. It is not easy to tell quickly whether the approaches chosen in different technological domains introduce new ideas or whether the differences just reflect domain idiosyncrasies. For the sake of easy identification of key differences between systems with self-configuring capabilities, I will explore higher level concepts for understanding self-configuration, such as the \u03a9 units, in order to provide theoretical instruments for connecting different areas of technology and research. 1  Self\u00adorganization, Structural Stabiliy and Self\u00ad", "creator": "Writer"}}}
