Results are presented as follows: < Table 15 approximately here > It appears from Table 15 that the three methods have similar results. Note that the MCDM method depends to a large extent on the values of the weight coefficients of the criteria under fixed preference of the criterion weights, i.e. the relative importance given to certain criteria. Sometimes, the final selection criteria change when there is a very small change in the weight coefficients of the criteria."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "This study proposes the Credibilistic Mean Value (TOPSIS) model, which is based on a combination of other MCDM methods; the operator of a fuzzy variable to facilitate a more accurate analysis of alternatives, taking into account several criteria in an imprecise environment; the proposed method is successfully applied to select the preferred disposal methods (s) for municipal solid waste for inaccurate data; (s) This model also provides the expected optimal choice for the disposal method (s) after effectively avoiding vague and ambiguous judgments; in many practical MCDM problems, different relative weights of criteria need to be taken into account as these are influenced by the socio-economic-ecological state of a country; (for municipal waste management); for example, a particular disposal method might not be accepted as the optimal solution for all countries; it is obvious that the sensitivity analysis is being carried out (Table 16 & 17); the proposed scenario shows that it is not the optimal choice in all cases (4)."}], "references": [{"title": "An analytic network process model for municipal solid waste disposal options", "author": ["S.
