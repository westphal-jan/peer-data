As we will see, the basic idea is the need for evolution, existing techniques, in a cost-effective way. It is extremely important to deal with the wealth of data in a meaningful way in order to (a) improve the performance of the model and (b) minimize the interventions of the experts. Thus, the first steps in the SSL field began around 1960, when scientists began to use new (i.e. previously unseen, undescribed) data to improve the capabilities of their models. Since then, and to this day, SSL field continues to encompass, motivated by the abundance of data of our age."}, {"heading": "1.1 Definition of semi-supervised machine learning", "text": "SSL is the task of machine learning to derive a function from marked and unmarked data. SSL thus falls between unsupervised learning, e.g. (Ranzato et al., 2007; Konstantinos Makantasis et al., 2013), and supervised learning, e.g. (Doulamis et al., 2003; Kosmopoulos et al., 2011). The basic idea lies in the usefulness of unmarked data (Seeger, 2001); when used in conjunction with a small amount of marked data, the performance of the model can be significantly improved in terms of accuracy, precision, etc. The use of unmarked data is based on various assumptions regarding its structure and characteristic space properties. Overall, there are three main assumptions that can be used either alone or in combination. Assuming that at least one suitable regulator is formed and used over the unmarked data, the model is trained and the overall performance evaluated.SSL is used as a problem solution or as a combination."}, {"heading": "1.2 A brief history", "text": "The concept of such an approach was fairly simple; learning a model, using it with new data to produce results, and using the new results to further explore the model, the latter appearing as transductive learning (Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 1974; Vapnik and Sterin, 1977), in which case the labeling process only occurs on the currently available (unlabeled) data. Unlike inductive inferences, no general decision has been made. In the 1970s, the Fisher estimation problem appeared to be a linear discriminatory rule with unlabeled data (Hosmer, 1973; Medicare achlan, 1977; Medicare achlan and Ganesalingam, 1982; O'neill, 1978). The main approach involved mixing Gaussians and the expectation of maximized algorithms into an iterative phase."}, {"heading": "1.3 Practical value of SSL", "text": "Acquisition of marked data for a learning problem often requires a skilled human agent (e.g., to transcribe an audio segment, the background in an image, etc.) or a physical experiment (e.g., determining the 3D structure of a protein to determine whether there is oil in a particular place).The costs associated with the labeling process can therefore make a fully labeled training set unfeasible, while acquiring unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive. In such situations, SSL can be of great practical value. SSL is also of theoretical interest in the field and as a model for human learning. A great advantage is the ease of implementing existing techniques; SSL can be directly or indirectly involved in a machine learning task. Semi-monitored SVMs are a classic example of the direct use of SSL assumptions in the miniature world."}, {"heading": "2 Understanding the SSL field", "text": "In this section, we delve into the world of SSL using mathematical notations and formulations.

To understand the techniques used and the approaches proposed in this thesis, someone needs to understand the basic formulations on the site3. First, we start with some basic notations, most of which agree with (Zhu and Goldberg, 2009a).

Smooth assumption: Dots that are close to each other are more likely to share a label. This is also generally accepted in supervised learning and leads to a preference for geometrically simple decision boundaries (Zhou et al., 2004). 2. Smooth assumption: Data tend to form discrete clusters, and dots in the same cluster tend to share a label (although data that share a label may be distributed across multiple clusters). This is a specific case of smoothing assumption and leads to feature learning using cluster algorithms (Li et al., 2008)."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Regularization", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "2.2.3 The importance of feature selection", "text": "When analyzing complex data, one of the biggest problems arises from the number of variables involved; analysis with a large number of variables usually requires a large amount of memory and computing power, or a classification algorithm that outperforms the training sample and generalizes poorly to new samples. Trait extraction is a general term for methods of constructing combinations of variables to circumvent these problems, while still describing the data with sufficient accuracy. In other words, poor traits compromise the accuracy of the model. The work of (Makantasis et al., 2015a) shows that low-level traits are not sufficient for complex visual recognition tasks, but selecting good traits does not guarantee good performance. The work of (E. Protopapadakis et al., 2015) shows that selecting the most important traits is not sufficient to perform complex visual recognition tasks."}, {"heading": "2.2.4 Possible risks", "text": "The possible problems depend on the technique used and can be categorized as basic theoretical problems and implementation problems. (1) The associated assumptions (s) are a common approach to making some assumptions regarding the undescribed data distributions (especially if we work with generative models (Vandewalle et al., 2013). (2) Degeneration in the non-informant function (Nadler et al., 2009) has shown that the diagrams of Laplacian methods (and more specifically the regulatory approach (Zhu, 2003) and the spectral approach (Belkin and Niyogi, 2002) are not well positioned in space.
