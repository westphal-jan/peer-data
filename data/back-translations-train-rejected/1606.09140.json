However, a network for a wide range of relation algebras, including dot algebra, Allen interval algebra, RCC8, and many others, is satisfactory if and only if it is qualitatively satisfactory. Contrary to conventional composition, the weak composition resulting from qualitative representations need not be associative, so that we can generalize network satisfaction problems over non-associative algebras by taking into account. We prove that qualitative representations have many advantages in terms of computation over ordinary representations: While many finite relation algebras have only infinite representations, each finite qualitatively representable algebra has a finite qualitative representation; the representational problem for (the atomic structures of) qualitative network algebra is always qualitative-associative; we are always comparable to an NP."}, {"heading": "1.

Maddux defines two such weaknesses: the semi-associative law x; (1; 1) = (x; 1) = (x; 1) = (x; 1) and the weak-asocial law [Mad82] (x \u00b7 1 \u2032); (1) = (x \u00b7 1 \u2032); 1); 1. In the definition of the qualitative calculation given by [LR04], identity 1 \u2032 is required to be an atom and in this case the weak law of associativity is to be kept safe (since x \u00b7 1 \u2032 is either 0 or 1 \u2032), as shown in [WHW14, section 3].

Conclusion", "text": "Let us examine some of the advantages of qualitative representations. For many applications in knowledge representation, it is natural to express that a certain relationship can be dissected in some way, without insisting that such a decomposition must always exist, for example, if it is claimed that y occurs strictly later than x, it may be the case that a z occurs in between, but not necessarily. In order to model applications in the real world using relative-like algebras, it is often necessary to consider some kind of representation for our algebras that would be excluded if we limited ourselves to strong representations. For relation verbs such as RCC8, where we want to look at separate regions and regions with holes, it has been known for some time that strong relational representations are problematic. Thus, the fact that qualitative representations encompass a very broad class of different representations that significantly expand our ability to model different situations."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The authors would like to thank Dr. Todd Niven for his significant contribution to the early development of this work."}], "references": [{"title": "Maintaining knowledge about temporal intervals", "author": ["James Allen"], "venue": "Communications of the ACM,", "citeRegEx": "Allen.,? \\Q1983\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Allen.", "year": 1983}, {"title": "RCC8 is polynomial on networks of bounded treewidth", "author": ["Manuel Bodirsky", "Stefan W\u00f6fl"], "venue": "Proceeding of the twenty-second international joint conference on Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "Bodirsky and W\u00f6fl.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bodirsky and W\u00f6fl.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "A survey of qualitative spatial representations", "author": ["Juan Chen", "Anthony G.
