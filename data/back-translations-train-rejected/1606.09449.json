Identifying tractable fragments and developing efficient algorithms for such fragments are thus important objectives in order to complement the sophisticated ASP systems available to date. Hard problems can become tractable if some problem parameter is bounded by a fixed constant; such problems are then called fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). While several FPT results for ASP exist, parameters that relate to directed or signed graphs representing the program at hand have been neglected so far. In this paper, we first give some negative observations showing that directed width measures on the dependency graph of a program do not lead to FPT results. We then consider the graph parameter of signed clique-width and present a novel dynamic programming algorithm that is FPT w.r.t. this parameter. Clique-width is more general than the well-known treewidth, and, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first FPT algorithm for bounded clique-width for reasoning problems beyond SAT.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 12:14:33 GMT  (40kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09449v1", "A short version of this paper has been accepted to ECAI 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 12:00:28 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09449v2", "A short version of this paper has been accepted to ECAI 2016 and TAASP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "A short version of this paper has been accepted to ECAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.DS", "authors": ["bernhard bliem", "sebastian ordyniak", "stefan woltran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.09449"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.09449.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["(bliem@dbai.tuwien.ac.at)", "(sordyniak@gmail.com)", "(woltran@dbai.tuwien.ac.at)"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 6.09 449v 2 [cs.A I] 3 0D ec2 01"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "An undirected graph G is a tuple (V) that goes from G (V) -V (V) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V (G) -V) -V (G) -V (G) -V) -V (G) -V (G) -V) -V (D) is a tuple (V) where V or V (D) is the vertex group and A (D) is the strongly connected component of a diagram D."}, {"heading": "3 Directed Width Measures", "text": "Since many representations of ASP programs with respect to steered graphs are based on a certain \"proximity to the city,\" it is natural to consider parameters for ASP that are relevant to steered graphs.

First, we made some negative observations that show that most directed width measurements (applied to the dependency graph or incidence graph of a program) do not lead to FPT results. On the other hand, we have converted a theoretical traceability result (implicit from previous work [31]) for the parameter clique width (applied to the signed incidence graph of a program) into a novel dynamic programming algorithm. The algorithm is applicable to any program whenever a defining k expression is given. It is expected that the algorithm runs efficiently, especially for small k, i.e. programs where the signed incidence graph has a small client width."}], "references": [{"title": "A trichotomy for regular simple path queries on graphs", "author": ["G.

Hard problems can become tractable if some problem parameter is bounded by a fixed constant; such problems are then called fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). While several FPT results for ASP exist, parameters that relate to directed or signed graphs representing the program at hand have been neglected so far. In this paper, we first give some negative observations showing that directed width measures on the dependency graph of a program do not lead to FPT results. We then consider the graph parameter of signed clique-width and present a novel dynamic programming algorithm that is FPT w.r.t. this parameter.
