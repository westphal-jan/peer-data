In this manuscript the authors applied various machine learning algorithms to a problem in the domain of medical diagnosis and analyzed their efficiency in predicting the results. The problem selected for the study is the diagnosis of the Chronic Kidney Disease.The dataset used for the study consists of 400 instances and 24 attributes. The authors evaluated 12 classification techniques by applying them to the Chronic Kidney Disease data. In order to calculate efficiency, results of the prediction by candidate methods were compared with the actual medical results of the subject.The various metrics used for performance evaluation are predictive accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity. The results indicate that decision-tree performed best with nearly the accuracy of 98.6%, sensitivity of 0.9720, precision of 1 and specificity of 1.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 07:00:07 GMT  (432kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09581v1", "6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables"], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Jul 2016 08:14:43 GMT  (310kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09581v2", "6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["sahil sharma", "vinod sharma", "atul sharma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.09581"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.09581.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Performance Based Evaluation of Various Machine Learning Classification Techniques for Chronic Kidney Disease Diagnosis", "authors": ["Sahil Sharma", "Vinod Sharma"], "emails": ["sahiil91@live.com", "vnodshrma@gmail.com", "dr.atul15@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "A.

The data set contains data from 400 persons from the southern part of India between the ages of 5 and 90 years. In total, there are twenty-four parameters, most of which are clinical in nature and the rest physiological in nature. Table 1 summarizes various parameters. In the pre-processing of the data, the missing values were treated by replacing numerical and discrete integer values with the mean of all cases with the same class designation as the instance in question and nominal values with attribute mode.Table 1 Various parameters used and their permitted values.Parameters allowed values Discrete integer values Blood pressure Discrete integer values Discrete integer values Discrete integer values Specific integer values (specific density Nominal density not available) Discrete predictive values (1,005,1,010,1,015,020,025) Albumin nominal values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values (2,4,5) Nominal blood pressure Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values (2,4,5) Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood pressure 1,4.5 Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values (2,4,5) Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood pressure 1,4,5 Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood pressure 1,4,5 Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values 1,4,5 Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood pressure 1,4,5 Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values (1,005,5) Nominal blood values Nominal blood pressure 1,005,5 Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values (1,005,5,5) Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood value (1,005,5,5 BC) Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood pressure 1,005,5,5,5,5 Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood values Nominal blood value (1,005,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"}, {"heading": "B.
