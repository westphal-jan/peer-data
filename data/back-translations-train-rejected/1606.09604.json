Our approach starts by training a feature-based statistical model, then converts this model to a rule-based variant by converting its features to rules, and \"snapping to grid\" the feature weights to discrete votes. In doing so, our proposal takes advantage of the large body of work in machine learning, but it produces an interpretable model, which can be directly edited by experts. We evaluate our approach on the BioNLP 2009 event extraction task. Our results show that there is a small performance penalty when converting the statistical model to rules, but the gain in interpretability compensates for that: with minimal effort, human experts improve this model to have similar performance to the statistical model that served as starting point.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 18:23:47 GMT  (313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09604v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marco a valenzuela-escarcega", "gus hahn-powell", "dane bell", "mihai surdeanu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.09604"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.09604.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "SnapToGrid: From Statistical to Interpretable Models for Biomedical Information Extraction", "authors": ["Marco A.

IE applications, for example, range from analyzing literature (Iyyer et al., 2016) to converting thousands of publications into complex proteins that represent signaling pathways (Cohen, 2015). By and large, most of these approaches are implemented using machine learning (ML). Generally, ML approaches in which the machine learns directly from the data are better than approaches in which human experts encrypt the structure to be extracted."}, {"heading": "2 Approach", "text": "We show in Section 3 that this is advantageous, even if the domain experts have limited time to work on the task and do not have access to data other than the model itself. To achieve this \"man in the loop\" goal, we propose the following three-step algorithm: 1. Train a statistical model for the present IE task (Section 2.1). The model may consist of several statistical classifiers, e.g. logistic regression, and not classifiers based on latent representations, e.g. neural networks. One limitation is that these classifiers may be function-based classifiers, e.g. logistic regression, and not classifiers based on latent representations, e.g. neural networks."}, {"heading": "2.1 Step 1: Build Statistical Model", "text": "Our statistical model is based on the most powerful approach to evaluation in 2009 (Bjo \ufffd rne et al., 2009). The approach is summarized in Figure 1. Similar to (Bjo \ufffd rne et al., 2009), our approach consists of two classifiers: the first classifier recognizes and labels event trigger words in the input text; the second classifier extracts and labels relationships between event triggers and potential event participants, which can be either protein units or other event triggers. Both classifiers are implemented using multi-stage logistic regression (LR), but our conversion process (steps 2 and 3) is independent of the underlying statistical model, so in principle other function-based classifiers could be used that assign explicit weights to features, such as perceptrons or linear support vector machines."}, {"heading": "The Trigger Classifier", "text": "The first classifier sequentially identifies each word in the input text as triggering a specific BioNLP event class or Nile as usual. We implemented the following features: Surface features: These features include the original and lemmatized words and the presence of the word in a gazetteer of known event triggers (which are automatically constructed from the training data); these features are generated for the word to be classified, as well as for the words that surround it within a window of n-tokens. In our experiments, we used two windows with n = 1 and n = 4; furthermore, sack-of-word features are generated for the windows and for the sentence as a whole. Syntactic features: These features capture the syntactic dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) that are directly connected to the token. All syntactic information was represented using Stanford dependencies (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008) and Corekit became Neolal, Manning (2014)."}, {"heading": "The Event Participant Classifier", "text": "This classifier pairs all triggers determined by the previous classifier with other named entities (in this case proteins) or event triggers occurring in the same sentence. These pairs are then classified into one of the possible participant relationships or Nile, indicating that there is no relationship between the pair. This classifier uses the following characteristics: Syntactic characteristics: These characteristics are based on the shortest path linking the two mentions (trigger and candidate) in Stanford's syntactic dependency graph. Two versions of the shortest path are used: lexicalized (the capture of words along the path) and unexicalized one.Surface characteristics: These characteristics include: the order of the two mentions in the text, their distance in the form of tokens, the number of entities and triggers in the sentence, the language parts and words of the mentions, and the number of triggers and entities between mentions."}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "Currently, Odin rules capture paths (via sequences or directional graphs) anchored at both ends (e.g. from an event trigger to an event argument) (Valenzuela-Escarcega et al., 2015; Valenzuela-Escarcega et al., 2016). Therefore, Odin cannot represent the following information: wordbag characteristics, syntactic paths that are not anchored at both ends (such as dependencies associated only with event trigger candidates), and characteristics that count the presence of tokens or units in the text. In Section 3, we analyze the performance drop when such characteristics are removed from the model."}, {"heading": "2.2 Step 2: Convert the Statistical Model to a Rule-based Model", "text": "Once the statistical model is constructed, we apply the lossy process below to transform it into an interpretable one."}, {"heading": "Converting Features to Rules", "text": "First, we convert the characteristics encoded in the statistical model into rules in the language of Odin (Valenzuela-Escarcega et al., 2015; Valenzuela-Escarcega et al., 2016). Generally, the previously introduced characteristics consist of conjunctions of information bits, each corresponding to a different rule fragment. For example, such a conjunction for the classification of event participants captures the type of expected trigger (e.g. phosphorylation), combined with 1As from June 2016 - Name: phospho _ event label: Phosphorylation pattern: | trigger: Phosphorylation theme: Protein = > nsubjpass1 \"Figure 2: Example of a rule for classification of event participants composed of a single feature. The feature captures the passive nominal subject (nsubjpass) starting from a phosphorylation outgoing (>) trigger and landing on a protein."}, {"heading": "Converting Weights to Votes", "text": "For this reason, we would ideally prefer to exclude them completely from the interpretable model. Conceptually, this is simple: we could use the weights to select the most likely output formula for a rule (from the previously generated options) and then discard it. However, our early experiments showed that this works poorly because it forces the algorithm to ignore the inherent ambiguity of the language captured by the statistical model by weights. For example, the trigger classifier learns that \"recruits\" serve as triggers for two different events, binding and localization, and consequently assigns different weights to the two labels, which are weighted on trigger attributes WeightsF-Requ frequency \u2212 5 0 5 100 200 600 1000 Relation-Weights Frequency \u2212 6 \u2212 4 \u2212 2 40 200 400 600 800Figure 3: weights of the two classifiers that we resolve on trigger basis requ-frequency class 200-Weights \u2212 10000 Relevance \u2212 600-100 Relevance \u2212 10005."}, {"heading": "2.3 Step 3: Edit the Rule-based Model", "text": "The final step of our proposed approach is to have human experts improve this model by working directly on it. The only limitations were: (a) they were not allowed to look only at the rules learned and not at the training data, and (b) they had to complete the process within an hour. Of course, this setting is artificial and unrealistic; we forced it in this work to demonstrate the interpretability of the model produced."}, {"heading": "3 Empirical Results", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it only takes one year to get to the next round."}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "Most biomedical IE systems in the academic world rely on supervised machine learning, including the most powerful system in the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task (Bjo \ufffd rne et al., 2009) and several approaches that improve its performance (Miwa et al., 2010; McClosky et al., 2012; Miwa et al., 2012; Bui and Sloot, 2012; Venugopal et al., 2014). Rule-based approaches (Appelt et al., 1993; Cunningham et al., 2002; Piskorski et al., 2004; Li et al., 2011; Chang and Manning, 2014) are preferable, however, when appropriate systems need to be used over long periods of time during which they need to be maintained and improved, as has been acknowledged in industry (Chiticariu et al., 2002). We are bringing these two divergent directions together by combining the benefits of ML with the interpretability of rule-based approaches."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We have proposed a simple approach that combines the advantages of machine learning models for information extraction (such as learning directly from data) with the advantages of rule-based approaches (interpretability, easier maintainability), starting with the formation of a function-based statistical model, then transforming this model into a rule-based variant by transforming its properties into rules and its property weights into discrete adjustments, learning from data similar to machine learning approaches, but producing an interpretable rule-based model that can be worked on directly by experts. BioNLP 2009 event task as a test bed shows that while there is a small performance penalty when the statistical model is converted into rules, the gain in interpretation compensates for this. In this work, we focused on building function-based classifiers, particularly logistic regressions, due to their potential extensions to remote supervision (DS), where training data is automatically generated."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under the ARO contract W911NF-141-0395."}], "references": [{"title": "Fastus: A finite-state processor for information extraction from real-world text", "author": ["Jerry R.

Our approach starts by training a feature-based statistical model, then converts this model to a rule-based variant by converting its features to rules, and \u201csnapping to grid\u201d the feature weights to discrete votes. In doing so, our proposal takes advantage of the large body of work in machine learning, but it produces an interpretable model, which can be directly edited by experts. We evaluate our approach on the BioNLP 2009 event extraction task. Our results show that there is a small performance penalty when converting the statistical model to rules, but the gain in interpretability compensates for that: with minimal effort, human experts improve this model to have similar performance to the statistical model that served as starting point.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
