While the complete modeling of such structures is impractical owing to the high level of complexity inherent to linguistic constructions, under a limited domain, certain tasks can still be performed. Recently, statistical techniques aiming at analysis of texts, referred to as text analytics, have departed from the use of simple word count statistics towards a new paradigm. Text mining now hinges on a more sophisticate set of methods, including the representation of texts as complex networks. In this perspective, networks represent a set of textual elements, typically words; and links are established via adjacency relationships. While current word-adjacency (co-occurrence) methods successfully grasp syntactical and stylistic features of written texts, they are unable to represent important aspects of textual data, such as its topical structure. As a consequence, the mesoscopic structure of texts is often overlooked by current methodologies. In order to grasp mesoscopic characteristics of semantical content in written texts, we devised a network approach which is able to analyze documents in a multi-scale, mesoscopic fashion. In the proposed model, a limited amount of adjacent paragraphs are represented as nodes, which are connected whenever they share a minimum semantical content. To illustrate the capabilities of our model, we present, as a use case, a qualitative analysis of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", a novel by Lewis Carroll. We show that the mesoscopic structure of documents modeled as networks reveals many semantic traits of texts, a feature that could be explored in a myriad of semantic-based applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 19:47:17 GMT  (846kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09636v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 25 Feb 2017 00:06:48 GMT  (1508kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09636v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["henrique f de arruda", "filipi n silva", "vanessa q marinho", "diego r amancio", "luciano da f costa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.09636"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.09636.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Mesoscopic representation of texts as complex networks", "authors": ["Henrique Ferraz de Arruda", "Vanessa Queiroz Marinho", "Diego Raphael Amancio", "Filipi Nascimento Silva", "Luciano da Fontoura Costa"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is a complex system in which the different types of texts that exist in a complex system of syntactical constraints and semantic relations are interwoven with each other.

CONCLUSION", "text": "To investigate the mesoscopic properties of texts modeled as networks, we proposed a novel approach that takes into account the semantic similarity between text segments. In contrast to previous studies, we modeled sequences of adjacent paragraphs as nodes in a network whose linkages are made solely by content similarity, allowing us to grasp two important features present in written texts: wide-ranging correlations and the evolution of history over time. The main feature of our approach concerns its ability to analyze documents in a multi-scale manner. Specifically, two parameters control the scale: (i) the number of paragraphs in each window and (ii) T: the threshold used to cut connections between nodes with low contextual similarity. We tested our approach in a well-known book, \"Alice's Adventure in Wonderland,\" by applying network visualization techniques to the mesoscopic networks generated."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors confirm financial support from Capes-Brazil, S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) (Grant no. 2015 / 08003-4, 2015 / 05676-8, 2014 / 20830-0 and 2011 / 50761-2), CNPq-Brazil (grant no. 307333 / 2013-2) and NAP-PRP-USP.6 (a) (b) FIG. 2: Visualization of the network G1, which is the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland with a threshold T1 = 0.41.
