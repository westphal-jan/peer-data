First, wherever possible, LGBP uses elevated inference rules to compactly represent large amounts of factors and variables within a cluster whenever it is efficient. We refer to this type of lifting process as regional lifting.

In future work, our first goal is to develop an elevated regional graph algorithm that bundles formulas in top-level regions, so that (1) the complexity of the inferences in each cluster is limited and (2) the number of messages in the model is minimized.
