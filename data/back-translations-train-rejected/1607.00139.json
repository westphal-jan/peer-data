This article describes TensiStrength, a system to detect the strength of stress and relaxation expressed in social media text messages. TensiStrength uses a lexical approach and a set of rules to detect direct and indirect expressions of stress or relaxation, particularly in the context of transportation. It is slightly more effective than a comparable sentiment analysis program, although their similar performances occur despite differences on almost half of the tweets gathered. The effectiveness of TensiStrength depends on the nature of the tweets classified, with tweets that are rich in stress-related terms being particularly problematic. Although generic machine learning methods can give better performance than TensiStrength overall, they exploit topic-related terms in a way that may be undesirable in practical applications and that may not work as well in more focused contexts. In conclusion, TensiStrength and generic machine learning approaches work well enough to be practical choices for intelligent applications that need to take advantage of stress information, and the decision about which to use depends on the nature of the texts analysed and the purpose of the task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 07:50:02 GMT  (401kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00139v1", "Thelwall, M.

It is necessary to improve the range of traffic flows (e.g. Wen, Lu, Zhou, Shi, etc.)."}, {"heading": "Psychological stress", "text": "On the physiological level, stress means the release of a number of chemicals into the bloodstream to prepare for a fight or flight reaction, but which can also be stressed by the stress hormone cortisol (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004), which increases blood sugar levels; this type of stress can be scientifically detected by measuring heart rate or testing for cortisol in Saliva, but can also be derived from self-report questionnaires (Arora et al, 2010). In contrast, psychological stress is a subjective feeling of pressure or strain as a result of a stressor in the external environment or internal perceptions of an inability to cope with a situation (Jones, Bright, & Clow, 2001). Stress and negative emotions often occur together, with any cause being a cause of an effect of stress and tension."}, {"heading": "Stress during travel", "text": "A non-academic study of a convenience sample of business travelers found that the main causes of travel-related stress are delayed or lost luggage, poor Internet access, not short economy flights, airport delays and nightly stopovers at the airport (Segalla & Ciobanu, 2012), and the flights themselves are a major source of anxiety for some travelers (Bricker, 2005), as well as commuting (Novaco, Stokols, & Milanesi, 1990) and travel sickness (Reason, & Brand, 1975), although some people like to travel (Ory & Mokhtarian, 2005). Jetlag can also be particularly stressful for those doing difficult tasks shortly after a trip (Waterhouse, Reilly, & Edwards, 2004), showing that context matters. During commuting, factors causing delays are also likely to cause stress (Stokols, Novaco, Stokols, & Campbell, 1978), but the level of commuters (Edwards & Edwards, 2004) is important."}, {"heading": "Detecting stress", "text": "A number of non-textual methods for passive detection of stress have been developed, for example, stress horoscopes can be detected in the sound waves of people talking to each other (Lu et al., 2012), and this could become a standard tool within smartphones; a more forceful approach is to detect physical reactions such as sweating or heart rate in order to detect certain stressors during the day (Bakker, Pechenizkiy, & Sidorova, 2011; Sakr, Elhajj, & Huijer, 2010; Sysoev, Kos, Sedlar, & Pogacnik, 2014) or during a commute (Healey & Picard, 2000); Within social media, a neural networking approach is used to detect short-term or longer-term stress in social media for individuals based on a number of factors, including the emotions expressed in their tweets (Lin et al, 2014); stress can be derived passively from activity patterns from mobile phones (Pentoloon)."}, {"heading": "Psychological relaxation", "text": "In psychology, relaxation refers to a state without tension and anxiety and is often seen as the exact opposite of stress, anxiety or tension (Pagnini, Manzoni, Castelnuovo, & Molinari, 2013); relaxation therapies are often suggested for anxiety disorders (Pagnini, Manzoni, Castelnuovo, & Molinari, 2013) and stress (e.g. Iglesias, Azzara, Argibay, et al., 2012; Werneburg, Herman, Preston, et al., 2011); stress in the workplace can be reduced through yoga programs (Wolever, Bobinet, McCabe, et al., 2012); other recognised relaxation techniques against stress include breathing exercises, muscle relaxation, jaw relaxation, listening to relaxed music, watching a relaxed movie or distraction (e.g. from the cause of anxiety)."}, {"heading": "Sentiment analysis", "text": "The task of detecting stress and relaxation is similar to the existing task of detecting sentiment in text. Sentiment analysis systems can classify texts into positive / negative categories (Turney, 2002), positive / negative / neutral categories (Pang & Lee, 2004), by strength of positivity and negativity (Thelwall, Buckley, & Paltoglou, 2012), by value and emotion (Paltoglou & Thelwall, 2013), by general polarity and sentiment strength on a single scale (Taboada, Brooke, Tofiloski, Voll, & Stede, 2011), or by strength and emotion (Neviarouskaya, Prendinger, & Ishizuka, 2010). Programs can try to classify whole texts or extract and classify parts of a text as in aspect-based (Liu, 2012) and concepts based on legends (Poria, Cambria, Winterstein, & Huang, 2014)."}, {"heading": "The TensiStrength approach", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world, where they will be able to move to another world, where they will be able to move to another world, where they will be able to move to where they are."}, {"heading": "Research Questions", "text": "The aim of this study is to assess the ability of TensiStrength to detect stress and relaxation in social web texts, especially with a focus on short-term problems and travel. Since the sentiment analysis is likely to be close to the stress / relaxation analysis, it is logical to compare TensiStrength with the similar SentiStrength program from which it was derived. It is also important to compare it with generic machine learning to assess whether machine learning is likely to be more precise. Therefore, the following research questions drive the study.1. Can TensiStrength estimate the strength of stress and relaxation in social web texts with a degree of accuracy comparable to, or at least significantly better than, that of chance? 2. Is the monitored version of TensiStrength more precise than the unattended version? 3. Is TensiStrength more accurate than the similar sentiment analysis program SentiStrenth 4. Is it a learning algorithm based on learning algorithms?"}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "TensiStrength was evaluated by applying it to human-coded texts from a purposeful corpus of 3,066 tweets in the English language \u2022 These tweets were collected using keywords from a variety of sources, as described below (see attachment for a full list of terms), although over a one-month period in July 2015 and then randomly sampled. The extent to which stress and relaxation appear in tweets depends on the topic of the tweets and the context and so, in order to evaluate the program on different types of tweets, several small businesses were collected and then combined into a large overall corpus. The number of tweets in each was approximately proportional to the number of total tweets collected. \u2022 Common short tweets, which contain a list of common terms and are likely representative of typical tweets. \u2022 Emotion terms that contain a list of emotion terms from the SentiStrength lexicon. \u2022 Tweets: tweets containing a list of offensive terms."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The correlations for the unsupervised version of TensiStrength (upper half of the cells in Tables 3 and 4) show that it performs significantly better in both stress and relaxation strength detection than randomly (a correlation of 0), although it also performs substantially worse than trained human coders. It performs better on the most important MAD measure of both stress and relaxation than unsupervised SentiStrength (lower half of the cells in Tables 3 and 4), with the sole exception of stress strength on the stress corpus."}, {"heading": "Corpus Tweets Corr.

Exact Within 1 MAD", "text": "The most important MAD values for the monitored version of TensiStrength (upper half of cells in Tables 5 and 6) are better than the corresponding MAD values for the unmonitored version of TensiStrength (upper half of cells in Tables 3 and 4), showing that the monitored mode is preferable to the unmonitored mode. Overall, the performance of the monitored TensiStrength (upper half of cells in Tables 5 and 6) is about the same as that of the monitored SentiStrength (lower half of cells in Tables 5 and 6) for the authoritative MAD measure of stress, but better for relaxation. This shows that the monitoring reduces the gap between TensiStrength and SentiStrength in the task of detecting the voltage."}, {"heading": "Corpus Tweets Corr.

Therefore, machine learning performs better than TensiStrength for stress detection and stress strength detection as long as correlation is not the primary concern. Choosing the method has an impact on the results, but most methods produce at least as good results as TensiStrength overall."}, {"heading": "Method Corr. Feat. Exact Feat. Within 1 Feat.

An important limitation is the nature of the corpus used for the evaluation. This was a useful and relatively balanced series of tweets that include a series of tweets, but the performance of the program may vary for other collections of text, such as those on a particular topic or from sources other than Twitter. Four of the six tweets were constructed from terms contained in the lexicon of TensiStrength or SentiStrength, and so their performance may vary at other levels of the company that include other stress-related terms. Methods are also limited by the fact that the coders and programs do not have access to any context above the tweet, such as the name of the twitter and the text of related tweets. This information would have improved people's classification accuracy more than the classification of automated methods."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The results show that TensiStrength is able to detect expressions of stress and relaxation in tweets with an appropriate level of accuracy compared to human coders, more accurately than a similar sentimental analysis program, but not as accurately as generic machine learning methods based on the same data. Unsupervised TensiStrength therefore provides an appropriate level of accuracy in a variety of different Twitter subrecorporations and shows that it is flexible enough to work in a number of different contexts. TensiStrength can therefore be used as a standard solution for detecting stress and relaxation, although genericmachine learning methods should instead be selected for tasks where stress-related topic recognition does not play a role, especially for sentences with multiple topics. The relatively small difference between the monitored performance of SentiStrength and TensiStrength is surprising as they are different from almost half of the tweets collected."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This research was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under funding agreement 636160-2, the Optimum project www.optimumproject.eu."}], "references": [{"title": "Stress, sleep and restitution", "author": ["T. \u00c5kerstedt"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "\u00c5kerstedt,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "\u00c5kerstedt", "year": 2005}, {"title": "The Imperial Stress Assessment Tool (ISAT): a feasible, reliable", "author": ["R.

This article describes TensiStrength, a system to detect the strength of stress and relaxation expressed in social media text messages. TensiStrength uses a lexical approach and a set of rules to detect direct and indirect expressions of stress or relaxation, particularly in the context of transportation. It is slightly more effective than a comparable sentiment analysis program, although their similar performances occur despite differences on almost half of the tweets gathered. The effectiveness of TensiStrength depends on the nature of the tweets classified, with tweets that are rich in stress-related terms being particularly problematic. Although generic machine learning methods can give better performance than TensiStrength overall, they exploit topicrelated terms in a way that may be undesirable in practical applications and that may not work as well in more focused contexts. In conclusion, TensiStrength and generic machine learning approaches work well enough to be practical choices for intelligent applications that need to take advantage of stress information, and the decision about which to use depends on the nature of the texts analysed and the purpose of the task.", "creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 15 for Word"}}}
