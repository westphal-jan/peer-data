INTRODUCTION", "text": "Entities play a central role in the interaction between social media and online news [1]. Millions of tweets are generated daily via local and global news, including people's reactions and opinions to the events depicted in those messages. Trending personalities, organizations, companies or geographical locations are building blocks of news stories and their comments. We propose to extract entities from tweets and their related context to understand what is said on Twitter about these entities and, consequently, to create a picture of people's reactions to recent events. Against this background, and using text-mining techniques, this work examines and evaluates ways to characterize specific entities by determining: (a) the main terms that define this entity and (b) the associated sentiment. To achieve these goals, we use theme modeling [2] to identify themes and relevant terms and phrases of daily entity tweets by identifying the aggregates (the) associated with them."}, {"heading": "2. METHODOLOGY", "text": "The main objective of the proposed system is to obtain a characterization of a particular unit in terms of the themes and feelings mentioned over time, i.e. to obtain a classification for each unit / day combination."}, {"heading": "2.1 Tweets Collection", "text": "To collect and process raw Twitter data, we use an online reputation monitoring platform [6] that can be used by researchers interested in tracking entities on the Web. It collects tweets from a predefined sample of users and applies the disambiguity of entities. [7] In this particular scenario, we use tweets from January 2014 to December 2015. To extract tweets related to an entity, two main characteristics must be defined: its canonical name, which should uniquely identify it (e.g. \"Cristiano Ronaldo\"), and a set of keywords that most likely refer to that entity when mentioned in a sentence (e.g. \"Ronaldo,\" \"CR7\"). Entity-related data is provided from a knowledge base of Portuguese entities, which can then be used to retrieve tweets from that entity by selecting those that contain one or more of these keywords."}, {"heading": "2.2 Tweets Pre-processing", "text": "Before analyzing the text in the tweets, we apply the following operations: 1. If a tweet has less than 40 characters, it will be discarded; 3. Keywords used to locate a particular company will be removed from the associated tweets; 2. Remove all hyperlinks and special characters and convert all alphabetical characters to lowercase; 3. Keywords used to locate a particular company will be removed from the associated tweets because these words do not contribute to a topic or mood; ar Xiv: 160 7.00 167v 1 [cs.S I] 1 July 201 64. A number of Portuguese and English stopwords will be removed - these contain very common and non-significant words such as \"that\" or \"a\"; 5. Any word with less than three characters will be removed, except for some white words that may actually be significant (e.g. \"PSD\" may refer to a Portuguese political party); these steps are intended to clean up the text and to improve the results, as well as to eliminate some of the remaining words, which may undermine the results."}, {"heading": "2.3 Topic Modeling", "text": "Topic extraction is done using LDA [2], which can determine the topics in a set of documents (a corpus) and a distribution of document topics. As we create each document in the corpus that contains every word used in tweets that refer to an entity, we can retrieve the most relevant topics about an entity on a daily basis in one day. Of each of these topics, we select the most related words to identify it. The system supports three different approaches with LDA, which produce different results: (a) the creation of a single model for all entities (i.e. a single corpus), (b) the creation of a model for each group of entities that fit into a similar category (i.e. sports, politics) and (c) the creation of a single model for each entity."}, {"heading": "2.4 Sentiment Analysis", "text": "Using SentilexPT [8] - a sentiment lexicon for the Portuguese language that can be used to determine the sentiment polarity of each word, i.e. a value of -1 for negative words, 0 for neutral words and 1 for positive words. A visualization system has been created that displays the most frequently mentioned words for each unit / day and their respective polarity using correspondingly colored and larger circles known as SentiBubbles."}, {"heading": "3. VISUALIZATION", "text": "The user interface allows the user to enter an entity and a period of time he wants to find out about and displays four sections: the first shows the most commonly used terms on that day within circles, which have two properties: size and color. Size is defined by the frequency of the term and color by its polarity, where green is positive, red is negative and blue is neutral. Subsequently, some sample tweets with the words contained in the circles are highlighted with their respective mood color. Users can click on a circle to view tweets containing that word, and a trend line is created that shows the number of tweets per day on a graph for the two years analyzed. Finally, the main themes identified are shown, showing the identifying words for each topic."}, {"heading": "4.
