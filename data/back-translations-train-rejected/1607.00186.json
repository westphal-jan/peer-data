(2016ab) makes the strong claim that \"the debate on the existence of sophisticated mental grammars was settled with Chomsky's The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (1957 / 1975)... But this debate has often been revived.\" But when it has been \"settled,\" the question arises as to why it is \"revived.\" In fact, it is not even clear whether the focus of the debate is what is innate, what is modular, what is universal, what is recursive, what is the \"Gradience\" of grammar, or the validity of theories encompassed in terms of three letters: \"Minimal\" G, \"\" Poetek, \"\" Poetsky \"(1991),\" Computing, \"Commandence\" Commandence \"of Gradicy\" of Grammality \"or\" Machine. \""}, {"heading": "2 Poverty of Science", "text": "While Pinker (1984, 1994, 1997) adheres to the Chomsky paradigm and defends an innate modular representation of our linguistic ability, he treats our scientific capacity within the same framework, turning both our language and our science into evolutionary artifacts rather than finding ways to model the world. This blurs the distinction between popular biology / psychology / theory and science, unless, by applying this limited rationality, we have managed to develop solid logics for argumentation, as they may be expressed in formal mathematics, learning algorithms, and falsificationist representations of science. Carruthers et al. (2002 / 2004) set out to explore Pinker's representation and subtract its negative conclusions about science. What distinguishes popular science from real science is that there is a logic of evidence that requires evidence, while evidence that has led to the formation of our hypotheses, even unconsciously, cannot be used as a model for, or a theory itself."}, {"heading": "3 Poverty of Evolution", "text": "It is clearly difficult to make demonstrable predictions for evolutionary theories - Darwin's theory was an example of pseudo-scientific intelligence in Lakatos (1970) - but there are ways, and in particular we can adopt the computational metaphor and treat evolution as an algorithm. To provide support for LAD compared to its alternatives, its predictions must be different from those derived from alternative models of language acquisition, development and emergence provided by cognitive linguistics. A computerized cognitive linguistic model suggests mechanisms based on ideas of similarity (metaphor), within and beyond modalities (Powers, 1997) that are important for survival (fitness) and that also predict other higher-level phenomena (analogy, metaphor, metonymy, metonymy, etc.) and provide explanations for gripping phenomena not used in science."}, {"heading": "4 Poverty of Dichotomy", "text": "This raises the question of whether problems with acceptance are syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic, and Berwick et al. (2016a) expect them to be syntactic and dichotomous, rather than the gradient of grammaticality that Lau, Clark & Lappin (LCL: 2014.2015) examine by correlating human Likert scale judgments with a statistical model. Berwick questions whether observed correlations are strong enough to accept that acceptance was a matter of probability (by concluding a question about the severity of human judgments with a question about the probablistic nature of grammar) The fact that certain simplistic probability or neural models do not correlate as strongly as they would correlate with human judgments, without a competing LAD-PAP model facing it, does not prove whether LAD-PAP is correct, language is probable, or acceptance is stamped (nor does it clearly contradict the underlying causes for both)."}, {"heading": "5 Poverty of Tagging", "text": "The most common reason sentences are mislabeled is part of ambiguity (POS), without recognizing the flexibility of English to force a word that is intrinsic or overwhelmingly a POS: a meaning can only be licensed in certain contexts, so the grammatical possibility is no different. Some words have a helpful or modal role and a literal meaning (be, have, go,...). A noun can generally be used to express an action that involves that object (e.g. a body part - \"He shoulders the player aside, heads the ball to a teammate, then brings it back to its destination.\") This is examined by Entwisle (1997, 1998), which leads to a critique of parsers and metrics that \"improve\" by ignoring such decisions and tending to or preferring the most common POS terms."}, {"heading": "6 Poverty of Psychology/Biology", "text": "Known for his political and philosophical arguments and polemical style, as well as for his linguistic contributions, Chomsky's arguments in his linguistic writings often share this political, polemical, and philosophical flavor. Indeed, such discussions of -isms in many places characterize the clash and clash of disciplinary views that triggered the emergence of cognitive science in general, and cognitive linguistics in particular, as arguments spilling over disciplinary lines and researchers attempted to synthesize interdisciplinary theories that were consistent in different forms of theory and evidence. Chomsky's (1959) \"linguistic\" perspective on Skinner's (1957) \"Behavioral Theory\" is actually what catapulted him to fame, though he was criticized both for his understanding of several behavioral errors \"in 1970 and for his linguistic contributions, and his arguments regarding his linguistic contributions, and his arguments in his linguistic writings, 2006 and his 2006, and his 25Palmer arguments."}, {"heading": "7 Poverty of Generative Linguistics", "text": "Chomsky is also credited with bringing \"generative\" formalism to linguistics, but Pullum (2011) points out that Chomsky's first published book, \"Syntactic Structures\" (SS: Chomsky (1957), did not address the question of whether English was a finite state language or an innate language acquisition device (LAD) in the 1950s. Nor did he address in \"The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory\" (LSLT) the draft of the 1955 typewriter, which was updated in 1956 in manuscipt and cited by Berwick in limited edition in the United States in 1957, not even in the final, heavily revised form published in 1975. SS (Chomsky, 1957) advocates a transformative generative grammar (TGG), building on an unformalized notion of transformations (linguistic theory, which Harris proposes to include Gnap and Gnap)."}, {"heading": "8 Poverty of Grammar", "text": "Powers and Turk's (1989) argument that Chomsky's approach is not neurological or computationally plausible presents evidence for violating Chomsky's agreed assumptions (Hockett, 1961) as well as discussing the implications of computerized language learning models. We have a rich supply, with early models such as Adriaans (1992ab, 1993), Anderson (1975), Block (1975), Ellison (1993), Entwisle (1997), Finch (1993), Gold (1967), Horning (1969), Powers (1983, 1991a), Siklossy (1971), and Turk (1984,1988,1990) and extends beyond the reach of grammar. It is worth noting that the phonology work of Bird and Ellison (1994) is traced back to that of Goldsmith (1976, 1991a), who developed his work (with some difficulty it seems) within the framework of the Chomskian model."}, {"heading": "9 Poverty of the Stimulus", "text": "Mirror neurons fire not only when the subject performs an action, but when they see someone doing the action. We divide the imitation into three different paradigms: 2a. the child speaks and the parent echo (mirroring), 2b. The parent speaks and the child echo (echolalia) and 2c. The child speaks and is directly mirrored (through a physical mirror or camera and monitor setup), which are listed in decreasing order of meaning and commonality: the parent echo the child much more than vice versa (Oostenbroek et al., 2016), and this is anchored in the kind of peek-a-boo games with children, as well as in the encouragement and shaping of the child's protocols (Dada said that the mirror or camera is not available, and the child must learn to recognize himself, and the fascination with mirrors and cameras therefore comes relatively late."}, {"heading": "10 Poverty of the Poverty argument", "text": "Chomskian linguistics relies heavily on gold (1967) in its 1989 argument for the Poverty of Stimulus (PoS), claiming that language cannot be learned because babies do not receive the negative information (stimuli) required for learning. However, the results of Gold (1967), Horning (1969) and Adriaans (1992ab) show that superfinite languages can be learned without such an explicit stimulus. Gold (1967) noted that its evidence collapses when input is ordered, for example, when a simple use of a construction is used before a recursive use of the construction (calling this \"anomalous text\" and opening the door to ignoring). Horning (1969) generalized this to probable information (namely, using clear non-recursive constructs sufficiently frequently to overcome the noise-like effects of excessively complex constructs that are consistent with psycholinguistic evidence that we already have in the language (which we can only learn in the 1980s)."}, {"heading": "11 Poverty of the Acceptability argument", "text": "It is important to observe that the Khomsk assumption that language is recursive is only an assumption (if it is part of the minimal program). In terms of computer science theory, it is possible that language is recursive and not recursive - that is, there is a finite amount of real estate that can be reallocated as needed, with the brain being a finite state automatic (FSA) and not an endless \"stack\" that grow as needed, generating sentences of unlimited length and complexity."}, {"heading": "12 Conclusion", "text": "Here, in each column, we have covered topics that are debated elsewhere at Booklength, taking into account less accessible pre-web theses and books, as well as early works directed against Chomsky (1957 / 75), as well as recent contributions replicated with TGG examples from (Berwick et al., 2016a). Finally, we focus on Berwick's title, stressing that the debate is anything but settled by Chomsky. \"Why take a chance?\" Acceptance judgments are influenced by contextual factors (the PoS examples) as well as modality (spoken against written) and of course register oneself, dialect, idiolectics, etc. (for the purposes of this paper, we assume that there is such a language as \"English\"). With acceptance judgments, we balance comprehensibility (I can find out what was meant) with suitability (it could have been better expressed)."}], "references": [{"title": "and E", "author": ["Pieter W.

Berwick does not in his abstract mention Gold\u2019s concerns about what it means to learn a language, or his concept of \u201cLanguage Identification in the Limit\u201d which is often juxtaposed against the idea of \u201cProbably Approximately Correct\u201d, but Berwick specifically questions the counterargument that \u201cdifferences in acceptability judgements can be closely approximated ... from probabilistic accounts\u201d. We discuss his recent critique of computational experiments that show acceptability judgements correlating with probabilities from simple computational models. This paper agrees with the view that this debate has long since been settled, but with the opposite outcome! Given the embers have not yet died away, and the questions remain fundamental, perhaps it is appropriate to refuel the debate, so I would like to join Bob in throwing fuel on this fire!", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
