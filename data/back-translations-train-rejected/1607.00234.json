We extended the neutrosophic set respectively to Neutrosophic Overset {when some neutrosophic component is over 1}, Neutrosophic Underset {when some neutrosophic component is below 0}, and to Neutrosophic Offset {when some neutrosophic components are off the interval [0, 1], i.e. some neutrosophic component over 1 and other neutrosophic component below 0}. This is no surprise with respect to the classical fuzzy set/logic, intuitionistic fuzzy set/logic, or classical/imprecise probability, where the values are not allowed outside the interval [0, 1], since our real-world has numerous examples and applications of over-/under-/off-neutrosophic components. For example, person working overtime deserves a membership degree over 1, while a person producing more damage than benefit to a company deserves a membership below 0. Then, similarly, the Neutrosophic Logic/Measure/Probability/Statistics etc. were extended to respectively Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off-Logic, -Measure, -Probability, -Statistics etc. [Smarandache, 2007].", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 02:17:59 GMT  (2293kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00234v1", "170 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "170 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["florentin smarandache"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00234"}, "pdf": {"name": "1607.00234.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Neutrosophic Overset, Neutrosophic Underset, and Neutrosophic Offset ", "authors": ["Florentin Smarandache"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Florentin SmarandacheNeutrosophic Overset, Neutrosophic Underset, and Neutrosophic OffsetFlorentin SmarandacheNeutrosophic Overset, Under- / Under- / OffLogic, Probability, and Statistics2Peer-Reviewer: Dr. Surapati Pramanik, Professor (Assistant), Department of Mathematics, Nandalal Ghosh B.
