Therefore, most cities have made significant investments in ICT infrastructure over the past decade, including computers, broadband connectivity and recently detected infrastructures. However, these infrastructures have enabled a range of innovative services in areas such as participatory sensors, urban logistics and ambient assisted living. Such services have been widely deployed in several cities, demonstrating the potential benefits of ICT infrastructure for businesses and citizens themselves. In recent years, we have also seen an explosion of sensor deployments and social networking services, along with the emergence of social networks. 2011) and Internet technologies (Perera et al., 2013; Sundmaeker et al., 2010) Social and sensor networks can be combined to provide a variety of value-added services to smart cities already as they have been dismantled through Internet applications."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to outdo themselves by taking themselves to task.

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS EXPERIMENTS AND", "text": "PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT"}, {"heading": "4.1 Introduction", "text": "The term sentiment analysis refers to an automatic classification problem. Its techniques attempt to distinguish between sentences of natural language that convey positive (e.g. happiness, pride, joy), negative (e.g. anger, sadness, jealousy) or even neutral (no-sentiment texts such as statements, messages, reports) emotions (designated as sentiment for our purposes) (Pang et al., 2002).A human being is capable of understanding a wide variety of emotions from textual data.This understanding process is based on complicated learning processes that we all go through while using our language as a means of communication, whether active or passive. It requires imagination and subjectivity to fully understand the meaning and hidden connections of each word in a sentence, two things that machines do not process.The most common practice is to extract numerical features from natural language (Godbole et al., 2007). This process translates this complex means of communication into something that machines can process."}, {"heading": "4.2 Natural Language Processing", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to orient themselves in a different direction from that in which they have gone."}, {"heading": "4.3 Dataset Improvements", "text": "At the heart of sentiment analysis is the data set. We are collecting and using ever larger sets of data to better train algorithms to distinguish what is positive from what is negative. Traditional storage techniques are increasingly cumbersome for large sets of data. ArrayLists and most collections add a large amount of overhead to the data, not only increasing the space needed to store it, but also delaying the analysis process. Therefore, new techniques for data storage and recovery are needed, techniques that allow us to store even larger sets of data and access them with even smaller delays. The most commonly used such technique is the hash list (Fan and Khademi, 2014), which first hacks the data in a certain predefined amount of buckets and then creates a list in each bucket to resolve any collisions."}, {"heading": "12 + ((B \u2212 E) \u2217 12) + (E \u2217 4)", "text": "In this case, each of us has our own bucket in which all pieces of data are placed in a small number of buckets in which it spreads. In this case, it is so that there is a doubling of the amount of memory of 1110 MB. (...) However, the best case for storage is the time in which all pieces of data are in a small number of buckets. (...) In this case, for N = 5, S = 11881376, we have a memory size of 1110 MB. (...) The best case for storage is if all pieces of data are in a small number of buckets, in the large list of buckets, S = 11881376, U = 1188, B = 2, E = 200610, E = 200610, we have an average memory size of 23 MB."}, {"heading": "4.4 Results", "text": "We measured three main KPIs for comparison of results: Two of them (success rate, kappa variable) measured the success ratio of the classification and one (execution time) measured the algorithmic improvement. We present them below. We perform experiments with 5 grams in the classic ArrayList format, in hash lists and in Dimensional Mapping. After storing the N-grams in these formats, we applied a 10-fold cross-validation to each of the seven machine learning algorithms we selected: naive Bayesian networks, C4.5, support vector machines, logistic regression, multilayer perctrons, best-first trees and functional trees. We then recorded the three KPIs for each of these 21 experiments. The results for the first two KPIs are shown in the following bar table. In the same diagram, we recorded the KPIs for threshold-based classification using an arbitrary threshold value."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The RADICAL platform, as presented in the current paper, successfully combines input from citizens accessed via smartphone applications and social networks in the context of smart city applications to create a test bed for the application of multiple analytical functionalities and techniques; the use of the resulting large aggregated datasets poses several challenges, the most important of which is timely efficient analysis; with a focus on data storage and representation, the experiments explored several techniques to find the optimal algorithmic approach to dimensional mapping; and in the future, the authors plan to use even larger and more complex datasets to further exploit the effectiveness of these social networking services.
