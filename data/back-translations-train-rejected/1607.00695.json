Our analysis shows that Pareto optimal results in a group remain optimal when the number of agents in the group is increased in many practical scenarios. This has implications for bottom-up approaches, since Pareto optimal results can first be calculated in subgroups and then used in scenarios that affect the entire group. We conducted experimental analyses of preferences taken from users in real-life scenarios and confirmed that this principle can be applied to a wide range of areas. Our results on performance and applicability indicate that we are able to calculate a significant ratio between the final pareto limit within subgroups. Conversely, we analyzed the applicability of our approach by considering how the ratio of pareto results increases with the size of the group. Our theoretical results do not show that this increase is as expected in all of the theoretical profiles."}], "references": [{"title": "Dynamic multi-agent task allocation with spatial and temporal constraints.
