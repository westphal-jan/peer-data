Bayesian mixture models", "text": "The main challenges lie in the lack of observability of the agreement between specific data points and their sources and the lack of a priori information about the number of sources [20]. Nonparametric methods place priors on the infinite dimensional space of the probability distributions and provide an elegant solution to the above modelling problems. In particular, the Dirichlet process (DP) allows the model to accommodate a potentially infinite number of mixing components [16]: p (x | 1: PM mixture) is an elegant solution to the above modelling problems.

Modelling topic evolution over time", "text": "We will now show how the described HDP-based model can be applied to the analysis of temporal thematic changes in a longitudinal corpus. Based on the assumption of a temporally locally static corpus mentioned above, we can start by discrediting time and dividing the corpus into epochs. Each epoch encompasses a certain contiguous period of time and has associated with it all documents with timestamps within that period. Each epoch is then modeled separately on an HDP theme, with models corresponding to different epochs that include its hyperparameters and the corpus level. Hence, if n is the number of epochs, we get n sets of themes that relate to it."}, {"heading": "III. EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION", "text": "We are now empirically analysing the performance of the proposed framework on the basis of a large real dataset."}, {"heading": "A. Evaluation data", "text": "We used the PubMed user interface to access the US National Library of Medicine and retrieve scientific articles from it. We searched for a publication on metabolic syndrome (MetS) using the key term \"metabolic syndrome\" and collected essays in English. Berardinelli et al. [8] was the earliest to publish. We collected all relevant publications until the last publication indexed by PubMed on January 10, 2016, resulting in a corpus of 31,706 publications. [1] Pre-processing: The raw data collected by PubMed is in the form of free text. To prepare it for automatic analysis, a series of \"pre-processing steps\" are required to remove words that are largely uninformative, reduce the spread of semantically equivalent terms, and then select terms that are included in the vocabulary that are learned about topics."}, {"heading": "B. Results", "text": "Results have been normalized by the total number of connections between two epochs to reflect changes in the total number of topics over time. Our results are summarized in Fig. 2. A significant difference between the two diagrams is easily discernible - over the entire span of the data corpus, the number of Bhattacharyya distance connections also formed by the use of the KLD is less than 40% and in most cases less than 30%. An even greater difference is seen when examining the proportion of KLD connections - it is always less than 25% and most of the time less than 15%."}, {"heading": "IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we presented an example of the importance of the use of advanced machine learning techniques in the analysis and interpretation of medical literature. We described a novel framework based on non-parametric Bayesian techniques, capable of extracting and tracking complex, semantically significant changes in the subject structure of a longitudinal document corpus. Furthermore, this work is the first to describe and present a method for distinguishing between two types of subject structure changes, namely the topic division and what we call the topic specification. Experiments on a large corpus of medical literature dealing with metabolic syndrome were used to illustrate the performance of our method. Finally, we developed a web application that allows users such as medical researchers to upload their data sets and apply our method for their analysis; the application and its code will be freely made available after publication."}], "references": [{"title": "Assessing blinding in clinical trials", "author": ["O.
