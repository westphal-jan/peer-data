Data collection.", "text": "We are focusing our attention on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, known as SLE or simply \"Lupus.\" Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a disease in which the immune system attacks cells and tissues of the body, resulting in inflammation and damage. There is no cure for SLE and its course is unpredictable. Figure 1 shows the most common manifestations of SLE and more information on its symptoms can be found at http: / / www.lupusuk.org.uk /. As documented below, the literature on SLE has increased dramatically over the past 20 years. Criteria for selecting the abstracts included in the study are based on guidelines provided by the specialized SLE research group at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, Spain. Basically, abstracts must have two features to be included in this research: First, the name \"SLE\" should be on the title of the study, and any abstraction should refer to clinical studies."}, {"heading": "2.2 Features of the dataset.", "text": "The final corpus contains 118,094 characters corresponding to 6,834 different words, which corresponds to an average length of 233 characters. No lemmatization was performed and the words took their graphic form. Words with an occurrence of less than 5 abstracts and a frequency of less than 10 times were removed. Prepositions, conjunctions, personal pronouns and demonstratives were also removed. Figure 2 shows the structure of the corpus. It has 506 lines and 1120 columns. Lines are associated with the abstracts, while the columns with the words."}, {"heading": "2.3. Aims of the statistical analysis of the bibliography", "text": "Bibliographic Content Studies is a discipline that attempts to capture the most important topics in a research area. By using associations or distinctions, researchers could track changes, advances and innovations in large textual datasets. In this perspective, it makes sense to count words for topic identification because it concludes that documents using the same words are closely related in subject and field (Benz\u00e9cri, 1981). In this respect, correspondence analysis (CA) techniques (Benz\u00e9cri, 1973, 1981; Lebart, L., Salem, A., & Berry, 1998; Murtagh, 2005) have proven to be a suitable tool for searching for similarities between documents by occurring words at the same time. The above techniques make CA a useful tool that can be applied to text mining (Bansard et al., 2007; Kerbaol, Bansard, & Coatrieux, 2006; Kerbaol & Bansard, Bersard & Bansard, 2006; Rennbaol, & 2000; Rennbaol, & 2000."}, {"heading": "2.4. Correspondence analysis", "text": "From a content point of view, correspondence analysis (CA) is an essential statistical method for performing text mining (Benz\u00e9cri, 1981; Lebart, 1998; Murtagh, 2005). First, the corpus must be encoded into a lexical table on which rows are abstractions, while words are columns. Weights for line abstractions and column words are automatically applied to CA analysis. Proportionality between the margins of the lexical table, length of abstractions and word counts are also managed during analysis. Similarly, rows and columns spaces given by square distances are used to calculate the main axes on each table. Consequently, abstracts are mapped more closely if they use a similar vocabulary, and words are mapped closer if they are more frequently present in the same way."}, {"heading": "2.5. Multiple factor analysis for contingency tables", "text": "According to Escofier & Pag\u00e8s (2008), Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) offers the possibility of introducing chronology as an active part of the analysis and further mapping abstracts based on their vocabulary."}, {"heading": "2.5.1. Principles", "text": "The MFACT (B\u00e9cue-Bertaut, \u00c1lvarez-Esteban, & Pag\u00e8s, 2008; B\u00e9cue-Bertaut & Pag\u00e8s, 2004) is an extension of the MFA. It is able to create multiple tables by juxtaposing several quantitative, categorical and frequent columns. To apply MFACT to this research, the data is structured as follows: The abstracts are described both by vocabulary and by chronology. MFACT gives both vocabulary and chronology an active role, but balances their influence in global analysis. If there is a relationship between chronology and vocabulary, the given axis is strongly correlated to them. B\u00e9cue-Bertaut et al. (2008) explains in detail how MFACT is applied to text mining."}, {"heading": "2.5.2. Types of results", "text": "In the case of the particular structure described above, MFACT provides the following results: Global results for active rows and columns: eigenvalues, representations of line abstracts and column words. In this global representation, the distance between two abstracts corresponds to the weighted sum of distances induced both by the vocabulary (as performed in CA on the lexical table) and by the standardized chronology (classical Euclidean distance). Partial results for the active rows and columns: overlapping representations of the abstracts from either chronology or vocabulary, facilitating the discovery of those abstracts that are more advanced in the use of the vocabulary (here called pioneering work because their vocabulary is used in an advanced manner). Illustrative columns can be introduced and displayed on the most important graphs. Year-in-categories and journal, both of which are considered categorical illustrative variables, are of interest."}, {"heading": "2.5.3. Validation", "text": "A permutation-based test evaluates the importance of the first global eigenvalue, which takes into account the link between chronology and vocabulary. The null hypothesis is the interchangeability of the publication year with respect to abstracts or, accordingly, the absence of a chronological dimension in vocabulary variability. Thus, the rows of the column year are randomly permutated, for each permutation a MFACT is performed, resulting in an empirical distribution of the first eigenvalue under the null hypothesis. A large number of replications allows the p-value associated with the observed value of the first eigenvalue to be obtained (one-tail test)."}, {"heading": "2.6. Lexical characteristics of periods", "text": "As mentioned above, a chronological division of the corpus is achieved by cutting off the course of the years from the point of view of the vocabulary (partial representation of the vocabulary), where large gaps between consecutive years represent significant changes in the vocabulary. The lexical characterization of the periods facilitates the understanding of the introduced novelties. To characterize these periods, the following characteristics can be identified (Lebart, L., Salem, A., & Berry, 1998): The characteristic words of each period or of the words whose frequency in a period is much greater than the randomness might suggest; the characteristic increments or words whose frequency increases significantly in comparison with the preceding periods; the increments designate topics that appear new in the corpus or increase their presence sharply; the chronological characteristic words that are assigned to the period or groups of consecutive periods that best characterize it."}, {"heading": "2.6.1. Characteristic words", "text": "With the aim of identifying very frequent (compared to very rare) words in parts of the corpus, e.g. those formed by grouping abstracts on an annual basis or by journals, the test described below is carried out: - n.., the total number of occurrences in the whole corpus; - n.j, the number of occurrences in part j; - ni.., the total number of words i in the whole corpus; - nij the number of words i in part j. The total number of words i in part j is compared with the other counts that are randomly extracted from the whole corpus with all possible samples composed of n.j occurrences (which is the zero hypothesis). If the word i occurs relatively more frequently in part j than in the whole sample, that is, if nij / n.j > ni. / n.. (rarer than in the whole sample), the value of jinnj1 (jinnj1) is composed by the Period (1)."}, {"heading": "2.6.3. Chronological characteristic words", "text": "Certain words characterize a group of consecutive periods better than a single period. Therefore, each word is successively tested as a possible characteristic word of each period (first level), each group of two consecutive periods (second level), each group of three consecutive periods (third level), etc. Each test is assigned a p-value. At the end of the process, each word is assigned as a chronological characteristic word of the period or group of periods it best characterizes, i.e. the group of periods associated with the lowest p-value (provided that this p-value is below 0.05)."}, {"heading": "3.1. Glossary of frequent words", "text": "Based on the glossary of the main topics, SLE is divided into six groups: etiology, epidemiology, symptoms, prognosis, diagnosis and treatment. Note that a word can occur in more than one topic."}, {"heading": "3.2. CA on the abstracts\u00d7words table", "text": "The first two axes, with eigenvalues of 0.30 and 0.27, correspond to the axes to which a large number of words and abstracts contribute. Note that they constitute a small part of the global inertia (a total of 2.72%).This low percentage, typical of the handling of large substitute matrices but very important in terms of the hypothesis of independence between words and abstracts, is often associated with a satisfactory structure of data, as discussed by Lebart et al. (1998).Figure 5 shows the metacs and metadocks that characterize the first main level. These metacs and metadoccs collect words and abstracts whose contribution is more than 6 times the mean contribution of their respective attitudes on one of the first two axes."}, {"heading": "3.3. Chronological evolution", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.3.1. MFACT: global analysis on the first plane", "text": "The first eigenvalue of MFACT is equivalent to 2 (Escofier, B., & Pag\u00e8s, 1992); the first axis, on which the words contribute 33.4% and the year contributes 66.6% of the inertia direction, is an average value; in this case the maximum is equal to 2 (Escofier, B., & Pag\u00e8s, 1992); the first axis, on which the words contribute 33.4% and the year contributes 66.6% of the inertia direction, is a dispersion direction present in both groups of columns; words and chronology, which differ from the first main axis of the axis of the axis, is the first axis of abstraction."}, {"heading": "3.4. Segmentation homogeneous periods", "text": "The periods 1994-2000, 2001-2006 and 2007-2012 are described by their lexical characteristics, which allow a characterization of the evolution of vocabulary, and the results are consistent with these Figures 6. Changes in the lexicon are mainly due to clinical symptoms, their etiology and the presence of new drugs developed. Figure 6 shows how studies in the medical sciences related to SLE were diversified from 1994 to 2012. In the period 1994-2000, the main topic \"symptom\" and treatments were based exclusively on \"anti-malaria\" (chloroquine and hydrochloroquine) and \"anti-inflammatory\" (methotrexates and cyclophosphamide) drugs, which were introduced both in 2001 and 2002 without any notable changes."}, {"heading": "3.4. Pioneer abstracts.", "text": "The overlapping representation of partial abstracts from the point of view of chronology or vocabulary from 2010 makes it possible to enter the abstracts with a vocabulary before their date. However, the volume of words only contributes to 33.4% of the inertia of the first axis, whereas the year of the column contributes 66.6%. This unequal contribution of both columns to the first axisinertia results in the sub-points \"chronology\" being placed on average farther away from the centering on the first axis than the sub-points \"vocabulary.\" This is particularly clear that the oldest dated abstracts are derived from their low numbers in the same year. These abstracts tend to present a partial point \"vocabulary\" mechanically before the sub-point \"chronology.\" On the contrary, this effect, unnecessarily marked, works first in the opposite direction, in the case of the most recent abstracts, which allow to interpret partial points \"vocabulary\" before the sub-points."}, {"heading": "4. Discussion", "text": "This study examined the approaches associated with the study of a word table, which is a special 2-way contingent table. Specifically, in this word table, each cell of our analytical unit is found: word, keyword or lemmas. The main purpose of this analysis is to obtain relevant information from the bibliographic databases by engaging in text mining. Correspondence analysis proved to be an appropriate statistical method to process this type of data for the discovery of significant word groups. Multifactor analysis with contingency tables (MFACT) was also suitable for discovering trends over the years and documenting pioneers. At the end of this research, proof was provided of the flexibility of these methods, which can be used as strategic tools to track impacts and trends in virtually any scientific bibliography, regardless of their subject matter."}, {"heading": "5.
