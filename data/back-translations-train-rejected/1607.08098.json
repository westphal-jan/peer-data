Consequently, the speed of progress in the development of such a system is directly related to the speed at which knowledge bases can be compiled and to their quality. We are trying to solve the problem of knowledge acquisition for an economic information system and are developing a supervised multi-strategic learning paradigm. This paradigm centers on a collaborative datamining strategy, in which expert groups work together using data mining techniques to acquire new knowledge derived from heterogeneous machine learning data models. The Actias system is our approach to this paradigm. It is the result of applying the graphical logic language of sketches to knowledge integration. The system is a collaborative data mining workplace in which the knowledge database of the information system is an algebraic structure. It results from the integration of background knowledge with new knowledge from data modeling tasks, which are presented as data modelling rules for specific tasks."}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "2 THE ACTIAS SYSTEM STRUCTURE OVERVIEW", "text": "These methods take into account the collaborative nature of the system. They classify users according to their workplaces and profiles in a data mining team. This decomposition extends the CRISP-DM specification by driving the creation and management of a business knowledge repository, defining the heart of the system from different perspectives."}, {"heading": "3 DATA MODELLING USING SKETCHES", "text": "This year, it has become one of the largest nodes in the world, with the largest number of nodes in the world."}, {"heading": "4 COLLABORATIVE DATA-MINING", "text": "The use of sketches for data modeling has been criticized as too complicated, especially in terms of formalism and the way in which the specification process is thought about, which differs from that of standard methods. At first, its use may seem exaggerated, but once the sketch methods are understood, this structure can quickly be applied to a variety of different data extraction problems with a certain degree of domain independence. Help in developing collaborative data mining strategies, as a way to share business knowledge between people with different profiles and expertise. Discovering knowledge from data can be seen as teamwork where different experts work together to specify business and data exploration processes, including applying different methods for storing and integrating data in a repository, specifying the data structure, manipulating models from data, extracting relevant information from models, and integrating knowledge."}, {"heading": "5 INFORMATION MODELLING", "text": "The Actias System Information Modeling methodology has the goal of defining a business sketch model based on the small part of the world associated with the Business Information System. This small part of the world corresponds to the business universe of discourse (UoD). The models of the data specification must be considered as possible states of the UoD, and the information can be stored on their structures or equivalents in the Business IS. This process is incremental according to the business knowledge needs and evolution. Therefore, the problem is to know whether the specification and its changes are compatible with the existing IS information structure. This requires the development of a strategy to validate the model against the IS structure."}, {"heading": "6 EXTRACTION PROCESS SPECIFICATION", "text": "A simple but typical approach could include processing data after processing the results. There are many possible options for each stage, and only a few combinations are valid. The primary goal of the extraction method is to support it, based on the fact that it is a graphical language based on the methods that enable structured definition and design techniques. (2) The definition and management of the language is effected by the fact that it is an atomic language. (3)"}, {"heading": "7 KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION", "text": "After performing an extraction process, the generated model or a set of models may provide new insights into the business that should be made available to other users by enriching the domain sketch model. This requires the development of an interface that can represent rules extracted from models and calculate their relative importance to the information stored in the Actias Data Warehouse. This requires the normalization of the models, since the system uses different types of machine learning models. To do this, we use probabilistic horn clauses. These types of rules are easily extracted from symbolic models, and if the model is connectionist, it is translated into a symbolic model by means of a mining process. The probabilistic horn clauses are similar to the way human experts express their expertise, and users are familiar with this type of expression of newly extracted knowledge. This is important in validating a knowledge base by experts, and for the use of knowledge, they have an important graphical advantage that they can easily translate into logic."}, {"heading": "8 KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION", "text": "Knowledge integration methods allow the combination of any collection of learned models, i.e. they can be generated by a collection of heterogeneous or homogeneous data models; this integration can be done on the extraction process as a post-processing integration function, or by the method of knowledge integration, if it is done on the basis of model-extracted horn clauses; integration on extracted rules can be done on the basis of their sketch-linguistic representation, and only on the basis of rules selected, for example, by the knowledge engineer; the use of sketches simplifies this task, since the sketch model of a rule set associated with a data model can be considered a model of a horn theory; and to then integrate the rule sets extracted, for example, from two models, correspond to two horn theories that have been extensively examined for sketches, and can be executed algorithmically for finite sketches; and to update the knowledge base with the new findings, the integration process is applied to all business models."}, {"heading": "9 KNOWLEDGE DEPLOYMENT", "text": "The system uses a web-based interface to provide knowledge, through which the user accesses models, performs extraction processes and views business knowledge. If the interface is used to access a model, a prediction or distribution is generated depending on the type of model.The consistency of a theory extracted from a model changes over the life of the IS, which requires updating the rule trust used in the business specification. This type of update takes place through an interface for providing knowledge, executing the required extraction process.The rules database used on the business definition of Sketch is accessible and represents the business knowledge base. This information can be used to define smart systems using the business information system. This strategy is used to simplify the direct use of the sketch."}, {"heading": "10 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "The Actias system is in the specification phase. Its success depends on the degree of integration achieved between its modules. Its ease of use strongly depends on the way the interfaces simplify the sketch specification process and the query definition, and how this process is integrated into the IDEF0 data processing specification tool CASE. We are currently developing prototypes for these interfaces. This is the first in a series of articles examining the benefits of using the sketch formal language to specify a discourse universe of the information system. We are extending the results of deterministic structure modeling based on finite sketches to a probabilistic framework, which will allow us to apply sketch logic sequencing techniques to the business model."}, {"heading": "11 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work is partially supported by the research project No. 37 / 2003 of the Instituto Polite \u0301 cnico de Lisboa."}], "references": [{"title": "A Comparation of Ranking Methods for Classification Algorithm Selection", "author": ["P.
