Anomalous detection refers to the problem of detecting patterns in data that differ from the expected behavior. It is an important and challenging problem with a wide range of applications, including computer intrusion detection, video surveillance, credit card fraud and biometrics [17, 8]. Many anomaly detection algorithms are based on the availability of a distance (or similarity) between data samples and search for anomalies by finding samples that are far away from their closest neighbors (see [20] and references therein). These algorithms are usually called similarity and are widely used due to their simplicity and robustness. In contrast, feature-based algorithms strive to embed the data in a relatively one-dimensional euclidean area and make use of others (or euclidean)."}, {"heading": "3 New PDE continuum limits", "text": "8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8,"}, {"heading": "4 Real-time anomaly detection", "text": "We propose here a modification of the PDA data to determine whether Yt is an anomaly that can only be considered as a current dataset.

Streaming experiments consist of a total of 1500 samples with a window history of T = 500. To emphasize the adaptive nature of our algorithm, each of these experiments produces a significant trend change in the middle of the stream. The third and final experiment was performed with real footpath data from a video surveillance problem. To evaluate the performance of the streaming algorithm, we use a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and its resulting Area Under the Curve (AUC). We look at how the AUC varies over time as the algorithm takes points from a stream.

The two similarity criteria were simply taken as component-wise differences; the nearest neighbouring parameters were given as k1 = 6, k2 = 7. At each step in the simulated current, there was a 0.05 probability of pulling out of the anomalous region. Figure 3 (a) shows the resulting AUCs at any point in time.

Each attribute is then assigned to a categorical distribution with the parameters p1,.., pni, j, which in turn are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution with the parameters \u03b11,., \u03b1ni, j.

The second was their difference in walking speed given by the 2-distance between the velocity histograms of each trajectory.As a preliminary experiment, we tested the anomaly detection and anomaly classification on 1666 trajectories from a single day. These trajectories were manually marked as normal or anomalous by [20]. In each experiment, the training group consisted of 500 trajectories randomly drawn from a total of 1666 trajectories on that day.

We have demonstrated convergence rates for continuity approximations and presented the results of numerical experiments with synthetic and real data that show that our algorithm can adapt quickly and efficiently to a changing data stream. Although we focused on the problem of anomaly detection in this paper, the ideas are not limited to this context. In fact, non-dominated sorting is often used in multi-objective optimization, and the ideas in this paper are potentially applicable to any such application, leaving many interesting problems for future work."}, {"heading": "A Derivation of new continuum limits", "text": "We give here derivatives of the new PDE continuum of n 2, and assume that in the order of the n 2 Pareto fronts there will be n 2 Pareto fronts.
