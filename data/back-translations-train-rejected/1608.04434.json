It could be used to handle large distributed data such as HDFS and traditional file systems such as FAT, NTFS, and exFat (Thusoo et al., 2009). In addition, HiveQL, an SQL-like language, is created to query data about Hadoop that translate the query to MapReduce jobs for high performance (Thusoo et al., 2009). The Pig is a high-grade declarative query language inspired by SQL-like languages."}, {"heading": "4.

Findings: Advantages and Disadvantages of KOSHIK", "text": "KOSHIK provides an architecture that uses Hadoop and related tools, as well as individual NLP tools and language models, and simplifies the construction of an entire NLP system. Adopting this architecture could allow people working with an NLP system to focus on their own professional areas. For example, linguists could focus on building effective language models to improve the accuracy of NLP, while algorithm designers could deploy high-performance NLP analysis components. If KOSHIK uses the Mate and Stanford sentence recognition component, it has the potential to process other human languages in the future as NLP tools continue to add new language models. Another advantage is that KOSHIK supports different types of document types, and it receives related APIs to expand the compatible document types of Mate and Stanford. In addition, KOSHIK with HDFS has the ability to analyze a large set of data with high input and forwarding capabilities."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "Natural language processing plays an important role in search engines, language-to-text conversion tools, smart assistants, and artificial intelligence, and it will continue to influence the user experience on the Internet. As more and more data is generated, there will be different types of data that will be processed on big data platforms. Hadoop provides useful tools and has a mature ecosystem that is ideal for processing natural language. There are already some research reports and software tools for natural language processing that use Hadoop. KOSHIK is one that provides an NLP architecture that uses Hadoop and Hive to process large amounts of data. It is friendly to developers and linguists because it can separate these two types of work and allow them to focus on their own areas, thereby enhancing the performance of the NLP system. KOSHIK's architecture is expandable; it provides APIs to add new features to the system."}, {"heading": "7. Recommendations", "text": "Based on the architecture of KOSHIK and the processing speed of large amounts of data, this architecture could increase processing speed by using Spark and GPU processing. Spark is a cluster computing system maintained by Apache and supports in-memory computing, which can improve data analysis speed as quickly as possible compared to the original MapReduce method in Hadoop (Zaharia, Chowdhury, Franklin, Shenker & Stoica, 2010). Based on test results from Zaharia et al. (2010), where they used Spark to analyze 39 GB of wiki data, the query time with Spark was 0.5 to 1 second. Hadoop query took 35 seconds, so Spark is much faster than Hadoop. Currently, GPUs are successfully integrated into Hadoop and MapReduce frameworks that could increase data processing speed within Java programs (Yadav, Bhadoria & Suri, 2015)."}], "references": [{"title": "Natural language processing and machine learning: A review", "author": ["F.
