Our task is to discover the nature of this resistance as it occurs in man, and to try to copy it into a universal machine. [Turing] Discipline is thus the execution of a universal [Turing] discipline, that is, the execution of an ordinary computer program. \"What is additionally required to produce intelligence, we call initiative.\" This means that Turing assumes that intelligence cannot be fully represented by any other correspondence kurtammon."}, {"heading": "2 Existence", "text": "The result is that the number of people who are able to remain in the city in which they live will diminish.

The principle of logical existence abstracts the logical aspects from the principle of physical existence. It is used to prove a theorem that states that a physical rule, which represents the implementation of the principle of existence, produces a sequence that cannot be calculated by any Turing program. The principle of logical existence can be considered a new principle of logic that has never been used before in a mathematical proof. The principle of existence overcomes the incompleteness of formal systems and the limitations of the Turing machines because it describes the perception of the physical existence of Turing programs as a whole. This allows a general reference and application of formal systems to themselves as a whole that cannot be achieved within formal systems themselves."}], "references": [{"title": "The Automatic Development of Concepts and Methods", "author": ["K.
