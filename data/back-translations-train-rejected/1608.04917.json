On one hand, we analyze their co-voting patterns and, on the other, their retweeting behavior. We make use of two diverse datasets in the analysis. The first one is the roll-call vote dataset, where cohesion is regarded as the tendency to co-vote within a group, and a coalition is formed when the members of several groups exhibit a high degree of co-voting agreement on a subject. The second dataset comes from Twitter; it captures the retweeting (i.e., endorsing) behavior of the MEPs and implies cohesion (retweets within the same group) and coalitions (retweets between groups) from a completely different perspective.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 10:10:14 GMT  (457kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04917v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 14 Oct 2016 09:47:42 GMT  (531kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04917v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["darko cherepnalkoski", "reas karpf", "igor mozetic", "miha grcar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.04917"}, "pdf": {"name": "1608.04917.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Cohesion and Coalition Formation in the European Parliament: Roll-Call Votes and Twitter Activities", "authors": ["Darko Cherepnalkoski", "Andreas Karpf", "Igor Mozeti\u010d", "Miha Gr\u010dar"], "emails": ["Darko.Cherepnalkoski@ijs.si"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 8.04 917v 1 [cs.C L] 17 August 2We examine cohesion within and coalitions between political groups in the Eighth European Parliament (2014-2019) by analysing two completely different aspects of the behaviour of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the political decision-making process. On the one hand, we analyse their voting behaviour and on the other hand their retweeting behaviour.

There are numerous studies reported in the literature that successfully correlate social media activity with phenomena such as the election results. We analyze two completely different aspects of how MEPs behave in political decision-making processes.

Firstly, we look less at their behaviour in elections, and secondly, we look at their retweeting patterns, so we draw on a similar work from two different areas of science: on the one hand, we look at the behaviour of politicians in literature, and on the other hand, we look at how they behave in order to better understand political and political processes, the latter being thoroughly researched in the field of data mining (particularly in the field of mining and network analysis), and on the other hand, this is the first paper to examine legislative behaviour in the EU."}, {"heading": "2 Results and Discussion", "text": "In this section, we give an overview of the data and present the results on cohesion within and coalitions between political groups in the European Parliament."}, {"heading": "2.1 Data", "text": "The RCV data is available in the form of XMLs. From the same website we also received the Register of Active MEPs [31]. This Register, although available as XML data, poses a challenge when integrated with the RCV documents, due to the IDs of the MEPs in the Register, which differ from the IDs of the same MEPs in the RCV documents. We used a method based on Jaccard removal to identify the missing mappings. In addition, we linked the individual MEPs to their Twitter ID, thus establishing an explicit link between the MEP and their twittering activities.The European Parliament consists of 751 Members. Within the period of our study, from 1 October 2014 to 29 February 2016, 36 MEPs left the European Parliament and were replaced by 36 new MEPs."}, {"heading": "2.2 Cohesion of political groups", "text": "In this section, we will first analyse the degree of cohesion of the political groups in the European Parliament by treating the vote as an agreement and networking.

Right-wing ENL and EFDD are by far the most coherent groups with an average of over 230 retweets, and all other groups have a significantly lower average number of retweets, ranging from 46 to 91. ENL and EFDD MPs post by far the most retweets (over 240), while at the same time more than 94% of their retweets are directed at members of the same group. Furthermore, these two groups stand out in the way the retweets are distributed within the group. A large proportion of EFDD retweets (1755) go to Nigel Farage, the group's leader. Similarly, a very large proportion of ENL's retweets (2324) go to Marine Le Pen, the group's leader. Farage and Le Pen are by far the most retweeted MPs, with the third group scoring 666 points."}, {"heading": "2.3 Coalitions in the European Parliament", "text": "The observation of ideological tendencies in coalition building within the European Parliament has already been made by other authors [12] and is confirmed in this study. Fundamental patterns of coalition building in the European Parliament can already be seen in the Co-Voting Network in Fig. 2A. It is noteworthy that the level of ties between European political groups indicating the level of cooperation in the European Parliament is almost exactly the same as the seating arrangement. In line with Western parliamentary traditions, the political groups in the European Parliament range from the Nordic Greens (GUE-NGL) and the Social Democrats (S & D) on the left to the conservative and right-wing populist groups (EPP, ECR, EFDD, ENL and NI) on the right. Looking at the level of cooperation between the various groups, the liberal ALDE appears to have a Euralism mediating role between the left and right-wing populist groups (ECR, EFDD, ENL and NI) on the left."}, {"heading": "2.3.1 Co-voting coalitions", "text": "Figure 6 and 7 give a more detailed understanding of coalition formation in the European Parliament. Figure 6 shows the degree of agreement or cooperation between political groups as measured by Krippendorff's Alpha, while Figure 7 is based on the outcome of ERGM. We focus first on the overall results shown in the right-hand figures of Figures 6 and 7. The strongest level of cooperation is observed using both methods between the two main parties (EPP and S & D) on the one hand and the liberal ALDE on the other. Furthermore, we see a strong tendency of the Greens to vote with the Social Democrats (fifth strongest coalition of Alpha and third strongest of ERGM) and the Nordic Greens (third strongest coalition of Alpha and fifth strongest of ERGM), these results underline the role of ALDE and Greens-EFA as mediators for the larger groups in order to achieve a majority. Although the two largest groups together have 405 seats, significantly more than the 376 votes required for large cooperation between the two largest groups (with both listed as the strongest groups)."}, {"heading": "2.3.2 Coalitions within individual policy areas", "text": "Next, we will focus on coalition building in the two selected policy areas. However, the area of State and Development of the Union is dominated by cooperation between the two major groups, S & D and EPP, as well as ALDE. Furthermore, we observe a high level of cooperation between groups generally considered pro-integration, such as the Greens-EFA and GUE-NGL. We also observe, especially in Fig. 6, a relatively high level of cooperation between groups considered Eurosceptic, such as the ECR, EFFD, ENL and the Group of Non-Aligned Members. The dichotomy between supporters and opponents of European integration is even more pronounced within the policy area of Economic and Monetary System. In fact, we are taking a closer look at these two areas as they are both controversial and highly significant. Our results reflect how controversial this area is. Again, both methods reflect the cooperation between S & D and EPP as the strength of the European Union."}, {"heading": "2.3.3 Coalitions on Twitter", "text": "The first insight into coalition building on Twitter can be seen in the retweet network in Fig. 2B. The ideological alignment of the political groups from left to right is reflected in the retweet network. Fig. 8 shows the strength of the coalitions on Twitter, as estimated by the number of retweets between MPs from different political groups. On the other hand, the strongest coalitions are formed between the right-wing groups EFDD and ECR and ENL and NI. At first, this may be surprising as these groups do not form strong coalitions in the European Parliament, as in Fig. 6 and 7. On the other hand, the MEPs from these groups are very active Twitter users. As mentioned above, the MEPs from ENL and EFDD post the largest number of retweets. Furthermore, 63% of retweets outside ENL retweets are retweets from NI and 7 retweets from NI. This effect is even more pronounced among the MEPs from EFDD, whose ECR account is responsible for 74% of their retweets from other countries."}, {"heading": "2.3.4 Formation of coalitions", "text": "In order to better understand the formation of coalitions in the European Parliament and on Twitter, we look at the strongest cooperation between political groups at three different thresholds. < 4 > 4 > 4 > Groups in the European Parliament, we choose a high threshold of Alpha > 0.25, and a negative threshold of Alpha < \u2212 0.25 (which is very antagonistic). Thus, we observe the general patterns of coalition and opposition building in the European Parliament and in the two specific policy areas. For cooperation on Twitter, we choose a high threshold of RT > 10, a medium threshold of RT > 1, and a very low threshold of RT < 0.001. The strongest cooperation in the European Parliament across all policy areas is shown in Fig 9G. Unsurprisingly, the strongest cooperation within the groups is (in the diagonal)."}, {"heading": "2.3.5 Relation between co-voting and retweeting", "text": "The results shown in Figure 10 quantify the extent to which communication in one social context (Twitter) can explain cooperation in another social context (co-voting in the European Parliament). A positive value indicates that the matching behaviour in the retweet network is similar to that in the co-voting network, which is specific to a single policy area. On the other hand, a negative value implies a negative \"correlation\" between retweeting and co-voting of MEPs in the two different contexts. Figure 10 bars correspond to the coefficients from the randomly covaried terms of the ERGM and describe the relationship between retweeting and co-voting behaviour of MEPs. The coefficients are aggregated for individual policy areas by means of a meta meta analysis. A detailed description of the methodology can be found in the section \"A network-based measure of co-voting.\" Overall, we observe a positive correlation between retweeting and co-voting in the EU, which is clearly different from the correlations between the European Union and the European security areas, which are only the strongest in terms of the external security."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusions", "text": "This is the only point on which the EU member states have agreed that the EU member states can agree on a common line, which is in line with what the EU Commission and the EU Commission have decided on with regard to the EU member states.

Although it holds the legislative function in the EU political system, it has been elected every five years since 1976 by universal suffrage covering all EU citizens, irrespective of their country of residence. Currently, the European Parliament has 751 members representing about 500 million citizens, representing an electorate of about 375 million. In this respect, the electorate is second only to India. It is the largest supranational parliamentary body in the world [34]. Although the European Parliament has long had the reputation of being a toothless institution, its powers have gradually been extended in recent years. The most important treaties in this regard were the Treaty of Maastricht of 1993 and the Treaty of Lisbon of 2009, the former granting Parliament veto legislation that comes from the Council, standing on an equal footing in the legislative process."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Political groups in the Eighth European Parliament", "text": "Most of them belong to the eight European parties that launched the integration process."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Roll-call voting in the European Parliament", "text": "In accordance with parliamentary traditions, the vote in the European Parliament is essentially a show of hands, and the President of the sitting then decides by visual assessment whether the majority is in favour or against the proposal in question. This method is a quick and simple way of establishing majorities in votes where only a simple majority is required. However, in certain cases, the votes are carried out by roll-call votes [40]: 1. In the event of close decisions or if Members feel that the judgment of the President is incorrect, the decision can be appealed; the President then has the opportunity to hold the vote again, this time using the electronic voting system (Article 181); 2. roll-call votes are applied at the request of at least 40 Members of Parliament, at the latest the evening before the parliamentary session (Article 180). However, a request for a secret ballot composed of the same number invalidates the roll-call vote. 3. The election of the European Commission (Article 118) is a motion of censure against the members of the European Commission."}, {"heading": "4.2.4 Policy areas", "text": "The roll-call voting data covers eight policy areas. Below is a brief description of the different policy areas [41, 42]: Area of Freedom, Security and Justice: This policy area concerns domestic policy and policies relating to justice and freedom of movement within the EU. It also includes the harmonisation of legal systems and cooperation at the level of police and justice between Member States. Well-known projects attributed to this policy area are the Schengen area, the European arrest warrant and Frontex patrols. Community policies: Concern European political parties and the interaction of the European Parliament at European and national level. It also covers the implementation of European treaties and all general issues relating to the EU institutions. Economic and Monetary System: This policy area covers all issues relating to the EU economic and monetary system and regulations relating to financial regulation, taxation, competition and the free movement of capital and payments."}, {"heading": "4.3 Co-voting measured by agreement", "text": "In this section, we show how the voting behavior of MEPs can be quantified by measuring the agreement between them. We treat individual RCVs as observations and MEPs as independent observers or advisors. If they cast the same vote, there is a high degree of agreement, and if they vote differently, there is a high degree of disagreement. We define cohesion as the level of agreement within a political group, a coalition as a coordination agreement between political groups and opposition as disagreement between different groups. There are many well-known measures of agreement in the literature. We chose Krippendorf's Alpha Reliability (Alpha) [5], which is a generalization of several specialized measures. It works for any number of observers and is applicable to different types and metrics (e.g. nominal, ordered, interval, etc.). Generally, Alpha is defined as Alpha = 1 \u2212 DoDe, where the actual discrepancy between observers (De) and MEPs (Agreement) is."}, {"heading": "4.4 A network-based measure of co-voting", "text": "In this section, we describe a network-based approach to analysing the participation behaviour of MEPs. The nodes in the network are MEPs, and an undirected lead between two MEPs arises when they cast the same vote in a roll-call vote. We are interested in the factors that determine coalition formation in the European Parliament, as well as cohesion within political groups. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent communication in another social context, i.e. the retweeting behaviour of MEPs, can explain the participation of MEPs. To this end, we apply an exponential random diagram model [6] to individual roll-call voting networks and aggregate the results using meta-analysis."}, {"heading": "4.4.1 Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM)", "text": "ERGMs allow us to examine the factors relevant to the process of network formation. Network metrics, as described in the abundant literature, serve to gather information about the structural properties of the observed network. However, a model that examines the processes driving network formation must take into account that there can be a variety of alternative networks. If we are interested in the parameters that influence network formation, we must consider all possible networks and measure their similarity to the networks originally observed. If ERGMs build on this idea, let us assume a random graph Y composed of a series of n nodes and e-edges, we must consider all possible networks and measure their similarity to the networks originally observed."}, {"heading": "4.4.2 Meta-analysis", "text": "Given the number of roll-call votes, it seems easy to interpret the different roll-call voting networks as multiplex networks and to combine them into a weighted network, which could then be analysed by an ERGM adapted to evaluated networks. [44] However, there are two reasons to take a different approach: firstly, the aggregation of roll-call voting data leads to an extremely dense network, which leads to serious convergence problems for the ERGM. Secondly, the roll-call voting data contain information on the different policy areas covered by the individual votes. As we are interested in how coalition building in the European Parliament differs in different areas, a method is required that allows for an ex-post analysis of the corresponding results. We have therefore opted for a meta meta-analysis approach, as described by Snijders et al. [45] and Lubbers [46]. This approach allows us to summarize the results by decompressing the coefficients into average effects and class-specific deviations."}, {"heading": "4.4.3 Specification of the ERGM", "text": "According to our research question, namely the evaluation of the factors driving the process of network formation within the roll-call co-voting network, the ERGM is specified with the following parameters: 1. Edge: This parameter can be understood as an intercept that balances the number of edges in the network. 2. Nodematch country: This parameter adds a network statistic to the model, i.e. the number of edges (i, j) where countryi = countryj. The coefficient indicates the homophilic mixing behavior of MEPs in relation to their country of origin. In other words, this coefficient indicates how relevant the nationalities are in the formation of edges in the co-voting network. 3. Nodematch national party: This parameter adds a network statistic to the model: the number of edges (i, j) with the country of origin."}, {"heading": "4.5 Measuring cohesion and coalitions on Twitter", "text": "Each MEP active on Twitter is a node in that network. An edge in the network between two MEPs exists when one MEP retweets the other. The weight of the edge is the number of retweets between the two MEPs. The resulting retweets network is an undirected, weighted network. We measure the cohesion of a political group A as an average retweet, i.e. the ratio of the number of retweets between the MEPs in the group retweets (A) to the number of MEPs in group | A |. The higher the ratio, the more each MEP (on average) retweets from the same political group, the higher the cohesion of the political group. The definition of the average retweets (RT) of a group A is: RT (A) = retweets (A) = retweets (A) | This measure of group A | we do not capture the retweets within the group, but rather the greater cohesion of the group A."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially supported by the EU projects SIMPOL (No. 610704) and DOLFINS (No. 640772) as well as the Slovenian ARRS Knowledge Technologies programme (No. P2-103)."}], "references": [{"title": "Limits of electoral predictions using Twitter", "author": ["D Gayo-Avello", "PT Metaxas", "E.

aspects of the behavior of the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the policy-making processes. On one hand, we analyze their co-voting patterns and, on the other, their retweeting behavior. We make use of two diverse datasets in the analysis. The first one is the roll-call vote dataset, where cohesion is regarded as the tendency to co-vote within a group, and a coalition is formed when the members of several groups exhibit a high degree of co-voting agreement on a subject. The second dataset comes from Twitter; it captures the retweeting (i.e., endorsing) behavior of the MEPs and implies cohesion (retweets within the same group) and coalitions (retweets between groups) from a completely different perspective. We employ two different methodologies to analyze the cohesion and coalitions. The first one is based on Krippendorff\u2019s Alpha reliability, used to measure the agreement between raters in data-analysis scenarios, and the second one is based on Exponential Random Graph Models, often used in social-network analysis. We give general insights into the cohesion of political groups in the European Parliament, explore whether coalitions are formed in the same way for different policy areas, and examine to what degree the retweeting behavior of MEPs corresponds to their co-voting patterns. A novel and interesting aspect of our work is the relationship between the co-voting and retweeting patterns.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
