However, one challenging question for measuring sensitivity in user-generated content is the recognition of idiosyncratic expressions. For example, after Apple launched its iPhone 6S, it is difficult to get the vocabulary out of the park. \"Shit hot\" and \"Shit hot,\" which are used to express the feeling of \"best\" and \"excellent,\" seem to be negative for a long time. Therefore, a fundamental task of analyzing user-generated sentimentality is to identify the polarization of this sentimentality."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Since a good sentiment lexicon is critical to the identification of sentiment expressions, such as SMS messages and tweets (5), various methods have been proposed in recent years to generate lexicon. For example, sentiment strengths can be propagated with synonymous relationships between words; the relationship can only include sentiment synsets in WordNet (3, 4), syntactic patterns in Corpora (6) and contextual information in sentences (7); in addition, the construction of domain-specific lexicon (8) and the use of crowdsourcing annotations (9) have been studied in previous work; other methods that directly model sentence sensations (10, 11).Our work also relates to the generation of lexical databases. The most commonly used English lexical dictionaries are WordNet (4), where words, meanings, relationships are well compiled in the structured database. Similar words are summarized as distinct sentences syntax."}, {"heading": "3 SlangSD: A Sentiment Dictionary of Slang Words", "text": "In this section, we present how we collect slang words from UD and how we assess the sensitivity of slang words."}, {"heading": "3.1 Collecting Slang Words", "text": "Urban Dictionary is an online crowdsourced dictionary of slang words, founded in 1999, in which words, their meaning and all other elements are uploaded by online volunteers. A word can have multiple meanings, so the order in which it is displayed depends on user votes. In summary, we searched through 5 elements of a slang word, including meaning, sample sentences, related words, upvote, downvote. Note that all the slang words listed have at least one meaning and one sample sentence, while some of them are without related words and have few voices. Since UD was famous for its satirical characterization, many meanings are sarcastically uploaded, such as \"LoL,\" of which is the most popular meaning (abbreviation of Laurence).7 Therefore, we suggest using only the related words for voice classification. Next, we will introduce details on how we use available resources to solve the problem."}, {"heading": "3.2 Estimating Sentiment Strength", "text": "When estimating the sensitivity of slang words, we scale the strength from -2 to 2, where -2 is strongly negative, -1 is negative, 0 is neutral, 1 is positive, and 2 is strongly positive. Sensation lexicon: First, since a small portion of slang words from UD were also defined by existing sensation lexicons, such as SentiWordNet (1), LIWC (13), MPQA (12), and the sensation lexicon compiled by previous work (3), we use these existing definitions to label the corresponding words. For example, we used the words that originate from UD to appear in existing sensation lexicons, such as \"comical\" and \"coarse,\" with their sensation lexicons strength in existing lexicons. For words that have different sensitivity levels in other lexicons, we take the average."}, {"heading": "3.3 Extending SlangSD", "text": "The extension of SlangSD consists of two steps: the acquisition of new slang words and the labelling of their sensory polarity; both steps can be automated. One way to obtain newly generated slang words is to query UD on the basis of the date of creation of new words. Thus, slang words created on July 14, 2016 can be retrieved by query UD by calling up \"http: / / www.urbandictionary.com / yesterday.php? date = 2016-07-14.\" Slang words can be retrieved so regularly or periodically by retrieving data table 2: Statistics of data concepts.Instances Slang Positive NegativeSMS 2.000 645 286 253Twitter 1.598.962 572.641 220.928 225.364 part, \"2016-07-14.\" As in section Positive Negative NegativeSMS 2.000 645 286 253Twitter 2.962 572.662 Slangle41, Slang terms can represent the Slanglems"}, {"heading": "4 Utility of SlangSD", "text": "In this section, we will examine whether SlangSD is useful for identifying feelings from user-generated content in practice. Next, we will conduct experiments to evaluate its usefulness on real data sets."}, {"heading": "4.1 Twitter and SMS Data", "text": "To evaluate SlangSD, we use tweets from Twitter and messages from Short Message Service (SMS). Twitter data is collected by Twitters Streaming API10. This API returns a subset of tweets at random. 9https: / / dev.twitter.com / rest / public / search / 10https: / / dev.twitter.com / streaming / reference / post / statuses / filterAs usual for large-scale captioning of tweets (20, 21), we use a predefined set of Emoticons11 to highlight the mood strength of tweets. The SMS data set is sampled from SemEval 2013 data set 12, which is publicly available.The data set contains sentences from short message services labeled with mood polarity.The statistics of the data sets are shown in Table 2. SMS is a small data set containing 2,000 messages. 645 messages contain words listed in SlangSD, which are negative, with a greater probability of 286% and a greater probability of 253."}, {"heading": "4.2 Experimental Settings", "text": "Sentiment analysis methods can generally be divided into sentence structure-based methods and lexicon-based methods. Sentence structure-based methods focus on the composition of words (11) and lexicon-based methods focus on finding important subjective expressions (22), such as sentiment words / phrases and negations, to determine polarity. Below, two corresponding algorithms are selected for comparison purposes. DeeplyMoving is a state-of-the-art lexicon-based method for identifying sentiment strengths in sentences (11). DeeplyMoving focuses more on sentence structures and has been widely used to reduce biases. SentiStrength (22) is a state-of-the-art lexicon-based method for identifying sentiment strengths in user-generated contents. 11https: / en.wikipedia.org / wiki List of emocons 12tcriseth / 2014 / Sentivalk.meq.lang.org /."}, {"heading": "4.3 Sentiment Analysis Results", "text": "The results show that DeeplyMoving achieves the lowest accuracy of all three models, and the SentiStrength model performs better than DeeplyMoving. It focuses more on identifying subjective expressions in short and informal texts. By including SlangSD, SentiStrengthSSD achieves the best result of the three methods. To further explain how SlangSD facilitates the problem of mood analysis on slang words, we report the results on tweets and messages containing slangwords, which are shown in Table 4 and Table 5 respectively. The one-on-one setting is used to calculate the precision, recall and F-Score. You can see that SlangSlangSicon performs significantly better in terms of F-Scores than SlangSlanggthSSD in negative tweets. As UD is known for satire, the results show that SlangSlangSgicon-Slanticon-Senticon-Sensicon-SensitionSenticon-SensitionSlangSlangSlangSlangSlangSlangonSensitionSlangSenton-SensitionSlangSlangSenton-SensitionSlangSlangSlangSenton-SensitionSlangSlangSlangSlangSentSSD is better suited."}, {"heading": "5 An Example Illustrating how to use SlangSD", "text": "In this section we will introduce how to include SlangSD with SentiStrength. We will briefly illustrate the process in Figure 2. The first step is to download the configuration files and the executable file of the software.13 The configuration files contain several dictionaries for SentiStrength. Secondly, to use the additional expressions, we will download the dictionary file \"SlangSD.txt\" 14 and append it to \"IdiomLookupTable.txt.\" We suggest to use \"IdiomLookupTable.txt\" because there are many phrases in SlangSD. These phrases share the similar format of idioms (a word combination).The fourth step is to load the configuration files. Then, SentiStrength can be used to classify the mood of the data sets. If the 3rd and 4th steps are skipped, the original results are based on Slang15 without the SlangD configuration."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Although methods are being proposed to address this problem, a key challenge in identifying sentiments in informal / short text is the lack of lexical resources to understand the sensitivity of slangSD. To this end, we propose a web-based learning approach to build the first SlangSentiment dictionary called SlangSD by leveraging the available online resources. It is shown that SlangSD can effectively improve the state-of-the-art informal text sense analysis tool and that it can easily be integrated as an additional SlangSentiment lexicon. Future work will include the continued addition of new slangwords to extend the reach of SlangSD, and maintaining the vocabulary of SlangSD through updates and ratings. The publicly available SlangSD will allow collective efforts to use SlangSlangSD in various sentiment analyses: tasks.http: / download.http: / / slang.wlv.lv.html / http: / starstars.load.html"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank DMML members for their feedback and assistance in this work, which is funded, in part, by ONR N00014-16-1-2257 and the Department of Defense under the MINERVA initiative by ONR N000141383.Reviews and Notes1.
