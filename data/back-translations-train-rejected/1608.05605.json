While the implementation of WSD will favor most natural language processing applications, the disambigualization of concepts is a critical component of applications based on clinical and biomedical texts in which the same word can denote different concepts, and can therefore elicit radically different reactions. This problem of ambiguity is the fact that clinical text is generally louder than other areas and contains a wide variety of abbreviations, some of which may be specific to a single hospital or physician. Furthermore, there is a distinct absence of large amounts of commented clinical texts, even in English, which poses a problem for supervised approaches to Word Sense Disambiguation."}, {"heading": "2 Related Research", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most people are able to feel how they are, to behave, and that they are able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "3 Materials", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Test Corpus", "text": "We use the MSH-WSD corpus (Jimeno-Yepes et al., 2011), which consists of a series of 203 ambiguous terms, each associated with several concepts, to evaluate our approach. Of the 203 terms in the corpus, 106 are regular terms, 88 acronyms, and 9 can be acronyms and regular terms. Up to 100 MeSH abstracts have been retrieved for each of these concepts, resulting in a set of 37,888 abstracts. In our approach, all abstracts have been pre-processed using the tokenizer from the Pattern package (De Smedt and Daelemans, 2012), and all stopwords have been removed from Scikit learning using the English stopword list (Pedregosa et al., 2011)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Word vectors", "text": "We evaluate our approach using three sets of vectors: the first set was trained using a small set of Medline abstracts1, and a second set of vectors created on the entirety of the MIMIC III corpus of clinical notes (Johnson et al., 2016). For both sets, we used the word2vec implementation of gensim (R-ehu-r-ek and Sojka, 2010), using negative sampling skip programs, a frequency intersection1 The specific IDs of these abstracts are in the online appendix of 5 and a negative sample of 15. In addition, we used a third set of vectors available at the BioASQ organizers2, which was trained on a much larger set of Medline abstracts2. 3 The model statistics are visualized in Table 1."}, {"heading": "4 Approach", "text": "Similar to the 2-MRD approach described above, our approach creates concept vectors by replacing each word in each definition with the vector representation of that word. This generates an M \u00d7 n matrix for each definition, where M is the dimensionality of the word vector, and n the number of words contained in that definition. Then, for each definition, we obtain a single vector of dimensionality M, applying a compositional function to the matrix, giving us so-called definition vectors that represent the entire meaning of the definition in a vector. Each concept can then be represented by an M \u00d7 d matrix, where d is the number of definitions that a concept has in the UMLS. Finally, we apply a second compositional function to this matrix, giving us a single vector of dimensionality M that represents the combined meaning of all definitions."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and future work", "text": "In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to WSD in the biomedical field that achieves comparable performance with existing methods without taking into account the relational information from anonymity, making the approach easily transferable to other languages for which such ontologies may not exist, and to other areas. High accuracy in word embedding modification also opens up interesting prospects for improvement; better word representation leads to an improvement of our approach without modifying the approach itself. Furthermore, we would like to experiment with various composition functions for the composition of the definition and concept vectors."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Part of this research was carried out as part of the Accumulate IWT SBO project, which is funded by the State Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT).
