The main problem following the discussion is the problem to find and describe a language structure for external and internal flow of information of companies. We anticipate that the language structure of external and internal base flows determine the structure of companies. In the structure modeling of an abstract industrial company an internal base flow of information is constructed as certain flow of words composed on the theoretical parts-processes-actions language. The language of procedures is found for an external base flow of information for an insurance company. The formal stochastic grammar for the language of procedures is found by statistical methods and is used in understanding the tendencies of the health care industry. We present the model of human communications as a random walk on the semantic tree", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Aug 2016 18:50:21 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05694v1", "40 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "40 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vladislav b kovchegov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05694"}, "pdf": {"name": "1608.05694.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "THE LANGUAGES OF ACTIONS, FORMAL GRAMMARS AND QUALITIVE MODELING OF COMPANIES", "authors": ["VLADISLAV B.

First of all, we want to clarify what modeling means. If a person or groups of people use any process or device, he / she or she can know what kind of language this process uses. For example, many people use cars every day. They need to keep a lot of information about cars in mind; the types of sounds and / or vibrations that are normal for the engine and so on. Very often, cars do not know how a car transfers the chemical energy from the fuel into the mechanical movement of the vehicle in order to get the vehicle going. All of these attributes could be considered as the language with which the car speaks to you. More often than it is likely that a driver does not know how a car translates the mechanical movement of the vehicle into the language, but they definitely know something about the language of the cars. So, any process or device communicates with us and uses a language. Sometimes, this language is very primitive, but the process speaks to us through a very complex language."}, {"heading": "1.

The main problem following the discussion is the problem to find and describe a language structure for external and internal flow of information of companies. We anticipate that the language structure of external and internal base flows determine the structure of companies. In the structure modeling of an abstract industrial company an internal base flow of information is constructed as certain flow of words composed on the theoretical parts-processes-actions language. The language of procedures is found for an external base flow of information for an insurance company. The formal stochastic grammar for the language of procedures is found by statistical methods and is used in understanding the tendencies of the health care industry.We present the model of human communications as a random walk on the semantic tree.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
