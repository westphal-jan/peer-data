To pilot test an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that selects peer change agents (PCA) to disseminate HIV testing messaging in a population of homeless youth. Methods. We recruited and assessed 62 youth at baseline, 1 month (n = 48), and 3 months (n = 38). A Facebook app collected preliminary social network data. Eleven PCAs selected by AI attended a 1-day training and 7 weekly booster sessions. Mixed-effects models with random effects were used to assess change over time. Results. Significant change over time was observed in past 6-month HIV testing (57.9%, 82.4%, 76.3%; p &lt; .05) but not condom use (63.9%, 65.7%, 65.8%). Most youth reported speaking to a PCA about HIV prevention (72.0% at 1 month, 61.5% at 3 months). Conclusions. AI is a promising avenue for implementing PCA models for homeless youth. Increasing rates of regular HIV testing is critical to HIV prevention and linking homeless youth to treatment.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Aug 2016 19:28:55 GMT  (101kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05701v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["eric rice", "robin petering", "jaih craddock", "amanda yoshioka-maxwell", "amulya yadav", "milind tambe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05701"}, "pdf": {"name": "1608.05701.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Robin Petering", "Amulya Yadav"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The aim of the pilot is to test an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that selects peer change agents (PCA) to disseminate HIV tests in a population of homeless adolescents.
