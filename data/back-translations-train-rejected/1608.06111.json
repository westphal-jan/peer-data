To introduce the transitional actions of our parser, we need additional notation. A configuration of our parser is a triple (B, A), where A is the set of AMR edges constructed to this point. To introduce the transitional actions of our parser, we use a function that shows indices from x to AMR graphs. For each i-edge [n], one (i) is a graph Ga = (Va, Ea) representing the setic contribution of the word to the aforementioned AMR fragments."}, {"heading": "4 Training the System", "text": "Several components need to be learned: (1) a transition classifier that predicts the next transition given the current configuration, (2) a binary classifier that decides whether or not to re-enter after a reduction, (3) a concept recognition step for each layer to calculate one (\u03b20), and (3) another classifier to label edges after each LArc or RArc."}, {"heading": "4.1 Oracle", "text": "To train our system with data, we need an oracle - an algorithm that delivers transition sequences that maximize the intersection between the gold standard graph and the graph dictated by the sequence of transitions, given a gold standard AMR graph and a set of transition sequences. Informally, statics means that if the actual configuration of the parser has no errors, the oracle provides a transition that does not initiate an error. Shortest stack means that the oracle prefers transitions that minimize the number of elements in the stack. Considering the current configuration (\u03b2, A) and the gold standard graph G = (Vg, Ag), the oracle is defined as testing the conditions in the given order and applying the action associated with the first game: 1. If it is possible for the first sentence to be reduced to the first sentence."}, {"heading": "4.2 Transition Classifier", "text": "Like all other transition systems of this type, our transition system has a \"controller\" that predicts a transition based on the current configuration (amongShift, LArc, RArc, and Reduce), and the examples from which we learn this controller are based on features extracted from the oracle transition sequences in which the oracle is applied to the training data. As a classifier, we use a forward-facing neural network with two hidden layers of 200 tanh units and a learning rate set to 0.1, with linear decay. Entering into the network consists of concatenating embedding for words, POS tags, and Stanford parser dependencies, one-hot vectors for named units, and additional sparse features extracted from the current configuration of the transition system; this is reported in more detail in Table 3. Embedding for words and POS-based words were pre-programmed from blank POS tags and blank features."}, {"heading": "4.3 Concept Identification", "text": "This routine is called every time the transition classifier decides to shift; it is called a (\u00b7) in \u00a7 3. This component could be learned in a supervised way, but we have not been able to improve a simple heuristic that works as follows: During training, for each shift decided by the oracle, we store the pair (\u03b20, \u2190 \u2212 \u03c0 (i) in a phrase table. Parsing then selects the most common graph H for the given token. In other words, a (i) approaches the graph that is in the training set among all events of the token xi. An obvious problem with the phrase table approach is that it does not generalize to invisible words. Furthermore, our heuristics rely on the fact that the mappings observed in the data are correct, which is not the case when the alignments generated by JAMR contain an error. To alleviate this problem, we can call New York a phrase that there is."}, {"heading": "4.4 Edge Labeling", "text": "Each time the transition classifier opts for an LArc or RArc operation, the edge marker must choose a label. There are more than 100 possible labels such as: ARG0,: ARG0-of,: ARG1,: location,: time and: polarity. We use a forward-facing neural network similar to the requirements of the transition classifier, with features shown in Table 4. The accuracy of this classifier in the development group is 77%. Label rules Sometimes, the label predicted by the neural network is not a label that meets the requirements of the AMR. For example, the: top label can only be applied if the node from which the edge begins is the special node. To avoid generating such erroneous labels, we use a set of rules shown in Table 5. These rules specify which labels are allowed for the newly generated edge, so that we only take into account those from which the edge starts."}, {"heading": "5 Fine-grained Evaluation", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "We compare our parser10 against two available parsers: JAMR (Flanigan et al., 2014) and CAMR (Wang et al., 2015b; Wang et al., 2015a), with the LDC2015E86 dataset for evaluation. Both parsers are available online and were recently updated for SemEval-2016 Task 8 (Flanigan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). However, CAMR's SemEval system, which reports a match score of 67, is not publicly available. CAMR has a quadratic worst-case complexity (although linear in practice). In JAMR, the concept identification step is quadratic and the relation identification step is O (V | 2 log | V), with the number of nodes in the AMR graph. Table 7 shows the results obtained by the parsers on all previously introduced metrics."}, {"heading": "7 Related Work", "text": "The first data-driven AMR parser is based on Flanigan et al. (2014). The problem is addressed in two separate phases: concept identification and relation identification. They use a sequence marking algorithm to identify concepts and define the relationship prediction task as a limited combinatorial optimization problem. Other suggestions include a synchronous hyperedge replacement grammar solution (Peng et al., 2015), a synchronous-based approach to concept identification, and propose a better way to handle this task: an action classifier to generate concepts by applying predefined actions. Other suggestions include a synchronous hypercanon replacement grammar-grammar-grammar solution (Peng et al., 2015), a synchronous graphical graphics-graphics approach to generate concepts by using predetermined actions. Other suggestions include a synchronous hypercanon replacement grammar-grammar-grammar-grammar solution (Peng et al, 2015), a grammar-grammar-grammar solution (a synchronous-based graphics-graphics approach to the use of given grammar rules by creating a stack of grammar grammar-grammar-grammar-suggestions)."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "We presented a transition system that builds AMR diagrams in linear time by processing the sentences from left to right, trained with upstream neural networks. The parser demonstrates that it is possible to perform AMR analysis using techniques inspired by dependency parsing. We also found that it is less informative to evaluate the entire parsing process with smatch than to use a collection of metrics to evaluate the various subproblems in the parsing process. We also demonstrated that our left-to-right transition system is competitive with publicly available state-of-the-art parsers. Although we do not achieve the best results in the smatch score, we have the same or better results for some of the proposed metrics. We hope that moving away from a single-metric rating will further accelerate progress in AMR parsing."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank the three anonymous reviewers Sameer Bansal, Jeff Flanigan, Sorcha Gilroy, Adam Lopez, Nikos Papasarantopoulos, Nathan Schneider, Mark Steedman, Sam Thomson, Clara Vania, and Chuan Wang for their help and commentary.
