INTRODUCTIONThe problem of the traveling salesman (TSP) is a well-known NP-Hard problem. It raises the following question: How can a traveling salesman visit all N cities at least once and return to his starting point in the most efficient way possible? Efficient in this context can be referred to distance, time or money. Due to its importance in the real world scenarios such as supply networks and supply chains, it has been extensively investigated and many optimization algorithms have been suggested in the literature [1], [2]. However, humans have repeatedly proven to be better than computer algorithms in certain cases of the problem [4], [5]. Another emerging scenario in which TSP is relevant are open world computer games, sometimes referred to as Free Roam, which allow players to freely explore a huge virtual world, complete missions and collect collectibles in their preferred order. Some famous games falling into this category are Grand Theft, World of Warcraft, Assased and Far Into Far."}, {"heading": "II. ALGORITHM", "text": "The algorithm of interest is based on the following game strategy: Always collect the item closest to your current position first. A player would generally use this strategy because it is simple and does not require much planning. In order to find the optimal solution, an algorithm was used that is based on an exhaustive search. It takes into account all possible permutations of the collectibles and is thus guaranteed to find the optimal solution. As the number of permutations is proportional to the factor number of collectible errors N!, this algorithm only works if N \u2264 13, which subsequently affects our analysis. The greedy algorithm works as follows: Algorithm 1: Greedy Algorithm 1: Procedure GREEDY (Start pos, C) 2: Current pos: Starts pos: 3: V \u2190 4: while | V | < | C | do 5: Next pos, c dist dist (current pos, c), what the next pos, C\\ V\\ proe.8: During the game, two positions will not be determined exactly."}, {"heading": "III. RESULTS", "text": "To illustrate this, we used an extract from the Far Cry 3 world, where collectibles are marked by jars (Fig. 1).Unsurprisingly, the performance of the greedy algorithm depends on the starting position, as shown in Fig. 2. In the first case, the route chosen by the greedy algorithm is suboptimal, resulting in a total distance of 3601 (Fig. 2 - upper left), as opposed to the optimal distance of 2764 (Fig. 2 - upper right), which is a difference of 30.2%. In the second case, a different starting location is chosen, which results in the greedy algorithm finding a solution that comes very close to the optimal solution (2961 \u2212 2883 or a difference of 2.4%), as seen in the similar routes in the second line of the Fig.Although this example is complicated, a detailed analysis is required to quantify the performance of the greedy algorithm as optimal."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this manuscript, we examined how a greedy algorithm compares to an exhaustive search for a variant of the Traveling Salesman problem that is relevant in many open-world computer games. We found that the main advantage of the greedy algorithm is that it can be performed by a player the way he plays, since no complex calculations are required, as opposed to an exhaustive search that can only be performed by a computer. We found that the performance of the greedy algorithm is comparable to the optimal solution, with the difference depending on the number of collectibles and the choice of starting point. For N = 11, the greedy algorithm resulted in routes that are on average 7.3% longer. Even when human errors were included in the estimation of distances, the greedy algorithm was on average less than 16.9% worse than the optimal solution, depending on the degree of errors. Unfortunately, our analysis was limited by the fact that the optimal solution is difficult to calculate with the complexity, N is always the closest to collecting the results for us > 13, which are the closest to the ones to collecting strategy."}], "references": [{"title": "Dynamic programming treatment of the travelling salesman problem.", "author": ["Bellman", "Richard"], "venue": "Journal of the ACM (JACM)", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1962}, {"title": "Genetic algorithms for the travelling salesman problem: A review of representations and operators.", "author": ["Larraaga", "Pedro"], "venue": "Artificial Intelligence Review", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Computation of the travelling salesman problem by a shrinking blob.", "author": ["Jones", "Jeff", "Andrew Adamatzky"], "venue": "Natural Computing", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Human performance on the traveling salesman problem.", "author": ["MacGregor", "James N", "Tom Ormerod"], "venue": "Perception and Psychophysics", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 1996}, {"title": "Human performance on the traveling salesman and related problems: A review", "author": ["MacGregor", "James N", "Chu", "Yun"], "venue": "Journal of Problem Solving,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2011}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 0, "context": "Because of its importance in real world scenarios such as delivery networks and supply chains it has been extensively studied and many optimization algorithms have been proposed in the literature [1], [2], [3].", "startOffset": 196, "endOffset": 199}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": "Because of its importance in real world scenarios such as delivery networks and supply chains it has been extensively studied and many optimization algorithms have been proposed in the literature [1], [2], [3].", "startOffset": 201, "endOffset": 204}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "Because of its importance in real world scenarios such as delivery networks and supply chains it has been extensively studied and many optimization algorithms have been proposed in the literature [1], [2], [3].", "startOffset": 206, "endOffset": 209}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "However, humans have repeatedly been shown to perform better than computer algorithms on specific instances of the problem [4], [5].", "startOffset": 123, "endOffset": 126}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "However, humans have repeatedly been shown to perform better than computer algorithms on specific instances of the problem [4], [5].", "startOffset": 128, "endOffset": 131}], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Since Pokemon Go sent millions on the quest of collecting virtual monsters, an important question has been on the minds of many people: Is going after the closest item first a time-and-cost-effective way to play?
