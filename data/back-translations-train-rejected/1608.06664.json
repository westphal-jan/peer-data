INTRODUCTIONIn order to make the data points in high-dimensional space H visible to humans, a method of word embedding (or dimension reduction) is used to map the data points into a lower dimensional space L. The method of word embedding attempts to maintain a relationship between the data points in H after they have been mapped to L. The output of the dimension reduction algorithm is a series of data points that are unevenly scattered across the visualization space. This helps to explain cluster behavior, including cluster and intra-cluster behavior between the data points. However, there are also some drawbacks: 1) The clusters confuse with others, some data points overlap with others. Overlapping makes the information less perceptible. 2) The data points are denser in some areas. The heterogeneity of the data points makes human interaction with the data points more difficult. To better use the visualization space, we suggest distributing the data points evenly over the visualization points."}, {"heading": "II. METHOD", "text": "The algorithm we propose is called the Split Diffuse (SD) algorithm (algorithm 1 > Split Diffusion Point) (algorithm 1), and it tries to implement the strategy given above. We follow the Split Diffuse (SD) algorithm in string c. At the end of the recursion, the placement of each point p is resolved. To achieve this uniformity in space L, the data points are essentially diffused from the denser area into the coarser area of the SD algorithm (S (p), forming a 2h x 2h array. This means that the mapped data points are evenly distributed in a 2h x 2h square. To achieve this uniformity in space L, the data points are essentially diffused from the denser area of the SD algorithm into the coarser area of the SD algorithm, meaning that the mapped data points are distributed evenly in a 2h x 2h square."}, {"heading": "III. PERFORMANCE", "text": "In order to measure the performance of the SD algorithm, we randomly generate the topics in 2D space L. We define deviation I as the ratio of the injured topology restrictions.

However, there are completely similar limitations in a 2D space L. A loose metric ErrII is defined in such a way that the restriction in dimension a is not violated if S (pi) | a = S (pj) | a.The random topics are generated by a 2D space over the uniform approach U, where the topics within a square are sampled; and the Gaussian approach G, where the topics of the two-variant Gaussian distribution are sensed, whereby the deviation by the magnitude of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the deviation of the devi"}, {"heading": "IV. APPLICATION AND CONCLUSION", "text": "We use the SD algorithm to analyze cybersecurity behavioral content. The goal of the system is to detect behavioral anomalies based on the access logs. A log entry usually has a timestamp, a unique identifier of a user, an action, and the content on which the action was performed. If punctuated correctly, the path, content, and / or any metadata related to that access can be considered a document designated as a content topic. We use the latent dirichlet allocation model [3] to decide the topics between all of these content documents within a reference period. In our system, 64 topics are generated in a word vector space of 19K + dimensions. Relevance between a content document and each topic is measured, and the anomaly or risk of access is quantified by comparing the topics involved in that access with the topics involved in the historical accesses of the same user."}], "references": [{"title": "Multidimensional scaling: I. theory and method", "author": ["W.S.
