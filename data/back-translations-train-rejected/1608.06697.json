It contains semantic explanations for the attributable use of 24 evaluation adjectives, accompanied by brief comments or supportive observations. The assumptions and operational principles of the NSM approach (cf. Goddard (2011), Goddard and Wierzbicka (2014) are explained in GTT, along with the analytical process that led to the explanations proposed below. The analysis drew on corpus data from WordsBanks Online, a commercially available corpus service. For the background of the study of evaluation language in general, and its application to sentiment analysis, see Martin and White, and Taboada et al al. (2011).Evaluation adjectives, and the language of evaluation in general, present fascinating challenges for the semantic description, both due to their harder injectivity as well as the number of subjectives."}, {"heading": "1 TEMPLATE A WORDS", "text": "Words that fall under Template A, for example, big, wonderful, grandiose, awesome, fabulous, terrible, terrible, can be described as \"I-thought-plus-feeling\" words. These words are openly subjective, modelled in the explanations of the main component \"I think like this....\" Then there is a model thought that begins with a strong evaluation in this set of explanations: either \"this X is very good\" or \"this X is very bad.\" The special character of each evaluation stems from the thought component, which is different for each adjective. The template is completed by a component that indicates that the speaker feels something very good or \"something very bad\" because of the way he thinks, as it may be the case."}, {"heading": "1.1 Template A+", "text": "a great X, e.g. a great movieI think about it like this: \"this X is very good, people can think\" this can't be like this \"\" if I think like this, I feel something very good because of a fabulous X, e.g. a fabulous movie, holidayI think about it like this: \"this X is very good, I didn't know before that the X (= such things) can be like this, I want to say more about it, but at the same time I don't know what to say\" if I think like this, I feel something very good because of the impressionistic, fabulous feels wonderfully close, but there are places where one or the other is strongly preferred or gives other implications; compare a wonderful opportunity and? a fabulous opportunity. Fabulous sounds enthusiastic, breathless, deliberately exaggerated."}, {"heading": "1.2 Template A\u2013", "text": "A terrible X, for example, a terrible movie; a terrible error I think about it like this: \"this X is very, very bad, something very bad can happen because of it.\" If I think like this, I feel something very bad because it is a terrible X, for example, a terrible movie, a terrible job, a terrible stay I think like this: \"this X is very bad, something very bad can happen to someone because of it.\" If I think like this, I feel something very bad because it is like this \u2022 Awful seems more subjective, more personalized than terrible; cf. this is terrible for you vs. * This is terrible for you. Similarly, a sentence like I have a terrible pimple seems quite ordinary, but would be strange because it sounds better than terrible, because it sounds less terrible."}, {"heading": "2 TEMPLATE B WORDS", "text": "Words that fall under the B templates (subtypes B1 and B2) are referred to as \"experiential\" evaluators. Examples are: entertaining, appealing for B1, gripping, exciting for B2. They differ from the words of template A in several respects. First, they are less overtly subjective, modelled in the explanations by a component that states that \"someone can think this way.\" That is, these evaluation words in this group work are associated with the time period in which someone experiences the stimulus (sees, reads, or otherwise is exposed) and ascribes certain thoughts and associated feelings to that hypothetical person. Second, words in this group say something about the \"experience\" of the things evaluated. In short, this means that the thoughts and feelings presented are linked to the period in which someone experiences the stimulus (sees, reads, or is otherwise exposed). Third, the template contains an additional semantic component that alludes to a potential physical effect on the affected person."}, {"heading": "2.1 Template B1+", "text": "It is interesting - e.g. an interesting documentary, an interesting reading, = > during this time (e.g. when this person watches this film, reads this book; when certainties happen to this person), this person can often think like this: \"I want to know more about what can be good, when someone says something about it, it can be good if I think about it for a while.\" If this person thinks like this, he can feel something because he does not feel it the way people feel it at this time. \u2022 The word interesting implies not only that he wants to know more, but also aspects of discursive engagement and cognitive engagement (vents in the press). A compelling moment, a compelling performance, a compelling story = > during this time (e.g. when this person watches this film, reads this book; when certain things happen to this person), this person can think like this: \"something happens in many cases where God predominates in the press.\""}, {"heading": "2.2 Template B1\u2013", "text": "a boring one - e.g. a boring lecture, boring meetings = > during this time (e.g. if this person sees this movie, reads this book; if this person sees certain things happen to this person), this person can think about it like this: \"this is like a lot of things were before I didn't want it to be like this that I want to do something else now.\" If someone thinks like this, he / she can feel something bad through it. Boring is in a way a half-opposite to interesting, but it's less demanding. Children use the word boring much earlier than interesting. It implies that someone \"turns\" to the happening \"and intentionally finds it.\" a predictable - e.g. a predictable act that ends during this time (e.g. if this someone sees this movie, reads this book; if certainties happen to this someone), this person can often think like this: \"something happens now, I knew beforehand that this would happen,\" if someone thinks like this, he / she can feel something bad at this moment, she / he / she will explain something to her, but this person is interesting, she / he / she is more interesting."}, {"heading": "2.3 Template B2+", "text": "As I said, this group of words follows a very similar structure to the B1 group, but with an additional component that suggests some kind of potential physical response."}, {"heading": "2.4 Template B2\u2013", "text": "A disgusting behavior - for example, disgusting behavior, a disgusting sighting during that time (for example, when that person watches this movie, reads this book; when certainties happen to that person), that person can often think, \"Someone is doing something very bad now, something very bad is happening because of that.\" If someone thinks that way, he / she cannot simultaneously feel something very bad about it. \u2022 In WordBanks, his / her most frequent attributive uses are not at all generic nouns like thing (e.g. the most disgusting thing I have ever seen / heard) or abstract nouns that indicate human actions and behaviors, e.g. disgusting habit / acting, disgusting behavior. \u2022 Disgust is hardly ever modified by already including VERY in its meaning. \u2022 There are sectarian links with someone who is sick (someone) and someone who touches that someone reading this book."}, {"heading": "3 TEMPLATE C WORDS", "text": "Words that fall under Template C, such as powerful, memorable, haunting, disturbing, etc., focus not on what it was like to have the experience, but on the subsequent ongoing effect on the viewer (reader, participant, etc.). The middle part of the explanations that model this \"after-effect\" contains psychological components that revolve around semantic primates such as THINK and FEEL. Moreover, as far as we can see, such words always imply a broad rating as good or bad, which appears as the final component of the template. Powerful (in terms of evaluation, such as a strong movie) and memorable are explicated in GTT."}, {"heading": "3.1 Template C+", "text": "Impressive - e.g. a haunting book / film; a haunting melody, if someone does something like that for a while (e.g. watches this film, reads this book, listens to this music), something happens to that person because of it, then it happens for a while: this person can't think about it, if this person thinks about it, this person can't feel something because this person can think about it like this: \"I felt this some time ago, I know when I felt it,\" if this person thinks like this for a while, he / she can feel something bad, at the same time he / she can feel something good because he / she can think like this: \"this is good,\" an inspiring story, an honor, an accounting, if someone does something like this for a while (e.g. watches this film, reads this book, listens to this music), something happens to this person because, for a certain time afterwards it is like this: this person can do something like this, if he / she can find it very good: \"these things I can do very well, if they can do these things very well.\""}, {"heading": "3.2 Template C\u2013", "text": "a depressing one - e.g. a depressing film, a depressing story, a narrative; a depressing song, if someone does something like that for a while (e.g. watching this film, reading this book, listening to this music), something happens to that person because of it, for a while after that it is like this: this person sometimes thinks: \"very bad things happen to people at many times, they don't want it to be like that, at the same time they can't do anything about it.\" if this person thinks like that, he / she can't think such a bad thing because of it: \"that's bad,\" a disturbing one - e.g. a disturbing film; disturbing images when someone does something like that for a while (e.g. watching this film, reading this book, listening to this music), something happens to this person because it is like that, for a while after that it is like that: this person can't think about it, he / she can't think about it, he / she can't imagine such a bad thing because he / she can't do it well:"}, {"heading": "4 TEMPLATE D WORDS", "text": "Words that fall under Template D, such as complex; excellent; brilliant, are purely cognitive assessments. That is, although they can imply feeling, they do not encode feeling. Within this group, there are several recognizable subgroups, but the differences concern the type of semantic components involved rather than the template structure. Complex, outstanding, outstanding, impressive and brilliant are explained in GTT."}, {"heading": "4.1 Template D+", "text": "an original - for example, an original story, a truly original idea, if someone knows what this X is, that person can think about it like this: \"I know that there was no such thing before, I know that it exists now because someone has done something, not like someone else has done before, that's good.\" \u2022 The word original has a unique but related meaning, which we see in contexts like the original proposal:... The above explanation refers to the evaluating meaning (roughly, \"creative\"), which, as you can see, often occurs with a modifier, for example, very, really, everywhere.

Relatively, even if the word ends with -ing and has the appearance of a participatory adjective, it implies a holistic assessment. A dismal one - e.g. a dismal failure, a dismal situation, if someone knows what this X is like, that someone can think about it like this:\" this is a very bad thing, very few such things (= things like this) are like that, when people think about it, they can feel something very bad, because it is \"a very sad one - e.g. a sad performance, in a sad state, if someone knows that this X is bad someone, someone can think about it very bad someone, very bad someone, very bad someone, very bad someone, very bad someone, very bad someone, very bad someone, very bad someone."}], "references": [{"title": "Semantic analysis: A practical introduction", "author": ["Goddard", "Cliff."], "venue": "2nd edn.
