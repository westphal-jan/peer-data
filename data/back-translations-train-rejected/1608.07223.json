The introduction of complementary strategies, in a quite general way, provides a tool to mimic the basic ingredients of a wide scope of real games. We find that only for the player having the higher offensive expertise (the dominant player ), maximizing the offensive always increases the probability to win. For the non-dominant player, interestingly, a complete minimization of the offensive becomes the best way to win in many situations, depending on the relative values of the defense expertise. Further simulations on the interplay of defense expertise were done separately, in the context of a fully-offensive scenario, offering a starting point for analytical treatments. In particular, we established that in this scenario the total number of moves is defined only by the player with the lower defensive expertise.

Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they have set themselves in order to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "2. Complementary strategy", "text": "The motivation behind the complementary strategy can be easily understood if we go back to our baseball game example = constant strategy with mixed results. Before starting the game, a lineup of nine individuals must be selected from among the entire team, and this lineup, barring minor changes, will consequently be maintained throughout the game. As we have already pointed out, this is tantamount to choosing a particular strategy. In a good approximation, it can be taken into account that the lineup with the best offensive performance of a player may not be the same as the one with the best defensive performance. In fact, individuals who have specialized the team generally in one of the two performances are. In this way, a specific line to maximize offensive performance will minimize defensive performance, and vice versa. In our model game, we define the complementary strategy as a number 0 \u2264 1, according to which a player i makes an offensive move each turn, or a defensive move with a probability of 1 \u2212 2 (see Fig. 2)."}, {"heading": "3. Role of defensive expertise: fully-offensive strategy", "text": "In order to better understand the effect of defensive expertise, we implement the fully offensive strategy in this section, rather than an artificial extreme case. In this scenario, the offensive expertise values are fixed at the maximum value, i.e., o1 = o2 = 1, while the area of defensive expertise d1 \u2265 d2 is carefully studied. The fully offensive strategy shown in Fig. 5 consists of a fixed algorithm for each move and is exactly the same in both players: at each turn, the players will always capture a piece, provided that there is one to capture, or to make a defensive move differently. This capture at the beginning of the tree in Fig. 5 allows to equally neglect the influence of offensive performance. Although this strategy is an artificial extreme case and does not correspond to every real game format, we show that it is very useful to study the isolated effects of defense. We ran simulations for opponents with defensive expertise d {0, 0.5, 0.75, 1}."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusions", "text": "We have presented a comprehensive numerical study of a simple model game with zero-sum game. This type of game covers a wide range of real sports for which a systematic study of the interplay between expertise and strategy has not been definitively undertaken. With this motivation, we have implemented a complementary strategy that maximizes offensive performance by minimizing defensive performance, and vice versa, in a continuous manner. This approach mimics real situations, such as selecting a specific lineup of a baseball team. Far from simplicity, our model shows that there is a rich scenario in terms of winning expectations that can be visualized by the winning matrices. The winning matrix is constructed using statistical simulations and allows the identification of the best strategies in a number of different scenarios. Our results suggest that the general belief that \"the best defense is a good offensive\" applies only to the dominant player. For the non-dominant player, the best strategy he adopts is strongly dependent on the four expert scores (defensive and both)."}, {"heading": "5.
