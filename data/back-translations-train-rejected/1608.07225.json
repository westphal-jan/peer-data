To accelerate the calculations, the system can be replaced by a faster approximation model. To create this model, a series of results is required for different parameter values. The set of parameter values has an impact on the accuracy of the approximation model. Different sampling methods for this set of parameters were proposed in [4]. Taking into account the number of inputs of the system and n the number of possible values by an input variable xk, the choice of n sample vectors can be represented by points on a hypercube of size and dimension k. Among the proposed designs, we focus on the Maximin Latin hypercube design (LHD). The LHD implements the Latin constraint: each coordinate in [1; n |] must appear only once in each dimension. In other words, the coordinates of any node differ in all dimensions."}, {"heading": "2 Typical approach to solve Maximin LHD with Simulated Annealing", "text": "SA is a metaheuristics most commonly used for discrete search spaces inspired by a metallurgical process. It consists in visiting the search space with a disturbance of the configurations and deciding whether the mutated configuration should be selected. Therefore, it alternates phases of heating and slow cooling to influence this choice: As in physics, we give the configuration the opportunity to find the lowest energy. It has been proven that SA approaches the global minimum probability of the metropolis [1]. Several ingredients are mandatory for SA [3]: a disturbance (a mutation), an evaluation function Hpot (also referred to as potential energy) and a temperature decrease T (k), where k is the iteration number. The probability of acceptance depends on T (k) and the gap of potential energy between the new and the old configuration."}, {"heading": "3 New perturbation targeting LHD", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Principle of the perturbation", "text": "To clarify its principle, we define the concept of the neighborhood: Definition 1 (neighbor of a point). For a given instance k / n, a point p1 of a configuration \u03c9 is a neighbor of the point p2, if and only if there is a dimension j for which the coordinates of these two points are closest possible. In other words, a point p1 (j) \u2212 p2 (j) | = 1. The new 1D-train mutation consists in taking a critical point as before and taking one of its neighbors. Then, we exchange the coordinates in one of the dimensions affected by the neighborhood. We choose a 3 / 5 instance to illustrate 1D-train. Table 1 specifies the coordinates of the points of a configuration. First, we select a critical point: dmin is determined by the points p1 and p2, so we take points p2 (on the axis x, neighbors on 4 and neighbors on the axis) and the coordinates on the z-axis are."}, {"heading": "3.2 Performance Evaluation", "text": "We reproduced the experiments carried out in [6], where the same value of the parameter p (p = 10) was reached for 4 / 25, 9 / 10 and 8 / 20 to show its performance (Table 2). SA performs a linear thermal descent until the temperature T = 0 is reached. The initial temperature is determined by a series of preliminary runs. We calculated 100 effective runs and here present the average within the 95% confidence interval. To explain the efficiency of the 1D train, we can refer to the SA problem of the migrating Salesman. Article [7] shows that the perturbations that move the smallest number of runs change the best number of points as m2 and m3. Consequently, 2 (n \u2212 2) distances are modified by all these mutations. However, we assume that the changes in the distances are smaller because the changes in the coordinates are \u00b1 1 thanks to the neighboring plot."}, {"heading": "4 New evaluation function targeting Maximin", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Presentation of a Maximin effect: narrowing the distribution of distances", "text": "We study the properties of distances obtained with the \u03c6p evaluation function in SA solutions. We represent all distances of a configuration in histograms and identify properties that allow us to establish a better evaluation function below. From now on, we distinguish three cases relative to values of n and k. We note the mean value of D for each configuration as D (k, n) = kn (n + 1) 6 as shown in [9]. Case n \u2264 kIn this case (see Figure 2, 50 / 40), the distances of potential solutions are concentrated around the mean. It is highly likely that two randomly taken points will be neighbors. This explains why one point is close to all others in SA solutions and we are talking about unimodal distribution. In our example 50 / 40 in Figure 2, the statistical range of D relative to D, DminD \u2212 DminD = 34013667 = 2.5% is narrow."}, {"heading": "4.2 Definition of evaluation function \u03c8", "text": "We propose to use a weighting function \u0433p, \u03c3 to replace the usual function \u03c6p. (3) The idea is to add weights wi \u2265 1 for each distance concept d \u2212 pi. These weights determine whether the distance is close to each other. If one distance is far from the other, the weight will be high. Consequently, it forces the distances to be close to each other. A single disadvantage is their complexity in O (n4). There are various ways to reduce this complexity. First, it is possible, for example, to take into account only the differences that exist in relation to | Dj \u2212 Di | 2 \u2264 5\u04452. In this way, we avoid calculating terms that can be considered negligible (e \u2212 5 1). Instead of adding (n \u2212 2) distances, we can select n (Dj) distances arbitrarily."}, {"heading": "4.3 Tuning of parameter \u03c3 and its justification", "text": "We focus on the parameter \u03c3: given that we aim to provide a large number of values, we must tune it globally. It must depend directly on nand k, with no preliminary experiments for each instance k / n. Consider the definition of p = n, \u03c3, this variable is introduced to regulate the magnitude of the exponential expression. We see that we should examine the variance of a random variable approximately in the magnitude of | Dj \u2212 Tue \u2212 2.This is why we are trying to give the expression of a linear function of k and n, which is similar to typical values. To establish it, we are investigating the variance of a random variable: which is based on Theorem 2.Theorem. Let D (k, n) be the random variable representing each square distance."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we present new techniques for treating the Maximin LHD construction, the first being the 1D Move mutation specifically tailored to the LHD structure, which is very efficient for local search for LHDs because it allows you to follow a step-by-step path on the cost surface without jumping over possible minimums, and the second tool, the p evaluation function, focuses directly on maximin optimization. As numerous problems, including Maximin designs, include this criterion, we emphasize that this function can be used for many other applications. In the Maximin LHD context, the p function attempts to find solutions by narrowing a number of possible distances. SA, with 1D-Move and p, \u03c3, provided better results than those considered \"the most well-known\" in most cases without any special coordination."}], "references": [{"title": "Statistical cooling: A general approach to combinatorial optimization problems", "author": ["E.
