Analysis, investigation and other types of interaction can be performed more efficiently on the topic grid than on the output of existing methods for dimension reduction.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "If there are multiple measurements of the individual samples, the data in a high-dimensional space H is described by these measurements. In order to make these high-dimensional data points visible to humans, a word embedding technique (or dimension reduction) is used to map the data to a low-dimensional space L. Usually, L is a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) space.

METHODS", "text": "In order to make better use of the visualization space, we proposed dividing the data points evenly across the visualization space. In the meantime, the cloud of data points is deformed in the same space defined by the dimension reduction algorithm of choice. This deformation is referred to as S. In the meantime, it is desirable to maintain the point-by-point relationship maintained by the dimension reduction algorithm of choice. Our strategy in approaching this goal is prioritized as follows: 1. Points are uniformly prioritized after mapping p.2. The point-by-point topology is retained. S tries to keep point pj on the same side of point pi as before mapping.3. The point-by-point geometry is pursued as follows: If the pi is far from pj, S (pi) is far from S (pj).The algorithm we propose is called the split-diffuse (SD) algorithm (SD) algorithm that follows the strategies."}, {"heading": "3. INTERACTING WITH THE DATA", "text": "The motivation to make better use of the visual space stems from the need to interact with enormous amounts of data. Consider the case that there are millions of elements that are shipped to a city each month. How can we easily observe the difference in monthly shipping patterns? Meanwhile, vectoring each element as a data point, with all the data points on a chart being hard to read. Instead, using clustering algorithms to group the points and show the representatives is a better way to present the shipping theme. However, with existing dimension reduction techniques (Figure 1 (a) - (d)), it is difficult to visually compare the difference and interact with the representative points for more detail. In our use case, we apply the SD algorithm to support the analysis of behavioral content in the cyber security domain. The goal of the system is to detect behavioral anomalies based on access data."}, {"heading": "4. FUTURE WORK", "text": "In addition to the domain of cyber security, the topic grids can be applied to other domains with free-form text protocols to analyze the behavior described by the protocols. Possible use cases include e-commerce, credit card transactions, customer service, or other behavioral data with large amounts of data to be analyzed. It is also possible to apply the topic grids to the structured data on which any cluster algorithm can generate cluster centers. Data points are then organized into these cluster centers, just as we use the topic to represent associated log entries."}, {"heading": "5. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] M. Belkin and P. Niyogi.
