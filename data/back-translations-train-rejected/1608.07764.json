[6] Consider the phenomenon of speech. The different situations in which the spoken words \"hello\" and \"hello\" are pronounced necessarily involve different movements of air molecules, so that we can say that language transcends molecular movements. In the case of consciousness, it is widely believed that consciousness watches over our brain, as it is observed that different conscious experiences are associated with different brain states. Consider the scenario of a class of schoolchildren, one of whom is called Alice, and another Bob. Is Alice's consciousness superior to class? Well, how we observe that any change in consciousness about Alice's consciousness must correspond to a physical change in the classroom that focuses on Alice's brain. But we can ask a slight universal question - the physical distinction in both cases is not overconscious."}, {"heading": "4 Computational Supervenience and Counter-", "text": "Factual Equivalence The basic idea of computer-aided supervenience theory is that a conscious state submits to a calculation. Of course, there are many running programs that perform the same calculation, the most trivial example being programs that perform the same steps for a certain period of time, but then drift apart after that time, which is the source of the first person's indeterminism, but it is also true that two different programs can run the same sequence of machine states without being mathematically equivalent to each other. The simplest example of such a difference could be when program A executes the \"or\" statements on registers x and y, and B executes the \"and\" statements. If it happens that both x and y contain the same value (both true and false), then the resulting machine state is identical to each program. But the two programs are quite different, as if the two registers have different values, the resulting machine state would be completely different.We call this a \"physical case,\" if two were factually different. \""}, {"heading": "5 Maudlin\u2019s Olympia Argument", "text": "Following Hoffman's story The Sandman, Maudlin refers to the former machine as Klara and the second as Olympia. One could argue that in both cases the machine goes through exactly the same sequence of states, but in the second case the calculation is absolutely trivial - reading the machine state from a record. The unspoken assumption is that Olympia is too simple to be conscious. One could argue that Olympia is not counterfactually correct. Klara does the calculation and would thus produce a different result if some of the intermediate results were different."}, {"heading": "6 Multiverse objection to Maudlin\u2019s argument", "text": "If the interpretation of quantum mechanics is true in the truest sense of the word, then we must also consider that the counterfactors will occur in alternative universes. In Maudlin's setup, the program either has fixed inputs that correspond to a specific story, or it has no inputs that may correspond to a dreaming state. If the situation is a fixed input, then it is easy to see that the quantum multiverse must also contain versions of the same program with different inputs. If it is the non-input situation, then counterfactual states must also occur in any physical implementation, due to the possibility of error or noise in implementation. Thus, if counterfactual situations are physically realized somewhere in the multiverse, then one can no longer claim that the attached Clare physically inactive in Maudlin's thought experiment."}, {"heading": "7 The Movie Graph Argument", "text": "Marchal originally presented his argument in French as l'argument du graphe filme [3], literally the filmed graph argument, which was translated into English as the Movie Graph Argument. The idea is that conscious calculation is implemented as a graph (or network) of state objects (e.g. abstract neurons) embedded in a sheet of glass and exchanging photons for messages, allowing a film camera to record a film about the operation of the artificial brain. Then, he separates part of the network between neurons by projecting the film back into the network as if they were still connected, and the result, like Maudlin's argument, is a physically identical process (at the state level) but not identical."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "Physical supervenience is simply not compatible with computer supervenience in a non-robust universe. For physical supervenience to be compatible with computer supervenience, we must inhabit a multiverse that, as mentioned above, is a robust case. The anthropic principle is the notion that our physical environment is compatible with our physical existence within that environment. This is a form of physical supervenience, and observed evidence consistently suggests that the anthropic principle is true. If we are to claim that we are not living in a multiverse, then we must abandon the computational supervenience thesis. But that would mean that a copy of a conscious program need not be conscious, which contradicts the so-called \"yes, doctor\" axiom of computationalism. So we would also have to abandon the computational supervenience."}, {"heading": "A Measure over the universal dovetailer", "text": "Fix a universal machine U, and let P be the entirety of all programs of U.
