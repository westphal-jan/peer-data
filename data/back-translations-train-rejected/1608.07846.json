To extend these ideas to the scientific field, Microsoft researchers describe the ability to analyze large amounts of data as the basis of a fourth basic research paradigm for understanding nature, the experimental, theoretical and simulation-based paradigms [5]. Sequencing the human genome was an early, high-profile scientific application of this ability [6]. A key method of data analysis in genomics and other medical sciences is the use of ontologies [7, p. 1251]: In the search for biologically and clinically meaningful data generated by today's high-throughput technologies, a common strategy is the creation and analysis of \"annotations\" in science."}, {"heading": "2.

If the manager is opportunistic in their treatment of accounting elements, the auditor can negotiate with them about advice."}, {"heading": "4. Summary and Future Work", "text": "In this paper we postulate that the operationalization of management theories as ontologies is novel and feasible. We then demonstrate a case study development of an auditor decision-making ontology using an already existing, YODA @ ssb Belief-Desires-Intention (BDI) ontology. We also postulate that such operationalization may be useful because automated conclusions can be used as data analysis methods using theories. Moreover, this concept is very preliminary and there are many potential obstacles to its further development. It may be that most management hypotheses are so abstract that they cannot be applied concretely to real data without unrealistic assumptions."}, {"heading": "6. Bibliography", "text": "[1] E.
