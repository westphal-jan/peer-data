However, the gates of data generation have recently been opened to a wider base of users who started participating increasingly with casual labeling, rating, annotating, etc. The increased online presence and participation of humans has led not only to a democratization of unchecked inputs to algorithms, but also to a wide democratization of the \"consumption\" of machine learning algorithms' outputs by general users. Hence, these algorithms, many of which are becoming essential building blocks of recommender systems and other information filters, started interacting with users at unprecedented rates. The result is machine learning algorithms that consume more and more data that is unchecked, or at the very least, not fitting conventional assumptions made by various machine learning algorithms. These include biased samples, biased labels, diverging training and testing sets, and cyclical interaction between algorithms, humans, information consumed by humans, and data consumed by algorithms. Yet, the continuous interaction between humans and algorithms is rarely taken into account in machine learning algorithm design and analysis. In this paper, we present a preliminary theoretical model and analysis of the mutual interaction between humans and algorithms, based on an iterated learning framework that is inspired from the study of human language evolution. We also define the concepts of human and algorithm blind spots and outline machine learning approaches to mend iterated bias through two novel notions: antidotes and reactive learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 02:37:21 GMT  (334kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07895v1", "This research was supported by National Science Foundation grant NSF-1549981"]], "COMMENTS": "This research was supported by National Science Foundation grant NSF-1549981", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC", "authors": ["olfa nasraoui", "patrick shafto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.07895"}, "pdf": {"name": "1608.07895.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Human-Algorithm Interaction Biases in the Big Data Cycle: A Markov Chain Iterated Learning Framework", "authors": ["Olfa Nasraoui", "Patrick Shafto"], "emails": ["olfa.nasraoui@louisville.edu", "patrick.shafto@rutgers.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

In the following, we will expand our analysis to the more realistic case where users have the choice of whether to act on a given input or not. Suppose people have some target hypothesis, h *, which represents an optimal performance for the algorithm. However, data is composed of an input provided by the algorithm, x, an output, y, and an action, a. The indicator variable a assumes a value of 1 if people have given an answer, and a value of 0 if people have not. If the value of y is not observed, it is recorded as y = zero. This form triples d = (x, y, a) = {(x1, y1, a1) if people have given an answer, and a value of 0 if people have no choice."}, {"heading": "2.3 A Blind Spot to Learning and to Human Exploration", "text": "In the following, we will introduce formal definitions that allow quantification of the extent and impact of interaction bias on humans and algorithms, beginning with the definition of the term \"blind spot\" in relation to human interaction with an algorithm. (This is the set of data elements from a universe of existing items or data sets, D, available for which a relevant filter algorithm is available, for which the probability of learning through human interaction with the algorithm that has used previously learned hypotheses is lower than or equal to the number of data elements from a universe of existing items or data sets, D, available to a relevance filter algorithm. (10) Analog concepts and metrics can be defined from the algorithm's perspective rather than human strategies, by replacing the probability that an item is seen or discovered by humans with the probability that it is observed, in particular, together with a relevance."}, {"heading": "2.5 Comparison with existing work and limitations", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to be able to go in search of a solution that is capable, that we are able, that we are able to find a solution that is capable of us, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution."}, {"heading": "3. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE OUTLOOK", "text": "There is a long tradition in machine learning of algorithms whose performance is guaranteed in the context of unbiased data. Similarly, there is a long tradition in the psychology of human learning of treating learning as a conclusion based on unbiased data. Humans and algorithms are increasingly engaged in interactive processes in which neither humans nor algorithms receive unbiased data. What are the long-term consequences of these iterative interactions on the performance of algorithms? On human knowledge? The unique contributions of this preliminary research result from bringing together mathematical, algorithmic, behavioral and computational perspectives from computer science and psychology to understand how algorithm performance and human behavior depend on each other and how these dependencies affect long-term performance."}, {"heading": "4.

machine learning algorithms have relied on reliable expert labels to build predictive models. However, the gates of data generation have recently been opened to a wider base of users who started participating increasingly with casual labeling, rating, annotating, etc. The increased online presence and participation of humans has led not only to a democratization of unchecked inputs to algorithms, but also to a wide democratization of the \u201cconsumption\u201d of machine learning algorithms\u2019 outputs by general users. Hence, these algorithms, many of which are becoming essential building blocks of recommender systems and other information filters, started interacting with users at unprecedented rates. The result is machine learning algorithms that consume more and more data that is unchecked, or at the very least, not fitting conventional assumptions made by various machine learning algorithms. These include biased samples, biased labels, diverging training and testing sets, and cyclical interaction between algorithms, humans, information consumed by humans, and data consumed by algorithms. Yet, the continuous interaction between humans and algorithms is rarely taken into account in machine learning algorithm design and analysis. In this paper, we present a preliminary theoretical model and analysis of the mutual interaction between humans and algorithms, based on an iterated learning framework that is inspired from the study of human language evolution. We also define the concepts of human and algorithm blind spots and outline machine learning approaches to mend iterated bias through two novel notions: antidotes and reactive learning.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
