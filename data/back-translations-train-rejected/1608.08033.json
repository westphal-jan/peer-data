Introduction", "text": "The extension of logical systems of mathematical fuzzy logic (MFL) with hedges is axiomatized by Ha \u0301 jek [1], Vychodil [2], Esteva et al. [3], among others. Hedges are called turkey stressing or truth-depressing when they, respectively, strengthen or weaken the meaning of the proposal applied.

In this section, therefore, we will expand FLn to include hedge connectors to model human knowledge and thinking. In addition to expanding language and the definition of formulas, new logical axioms are added to characterize the properties of the new connectors. One of the most important properties should be the conservation of logical equivalence. Definition 8 [7] Ln \u2192 L should be an n-ary operation. It is called logically appropriate if it meets the following condition: There are natural numbers k1 > 0,.., kn > 0 such that (a1) b1, k1, kn, a1."}, {"heading": "3.1.

Therefore, there may be axioms expressing dual relationships of hedges in addition to axioms expressing their comparative truth modification strength. In this subsection, FLn is extended by many dual hedges in which each hedge has its own dual uniformity. Definition 10 (FLn with many dual hedges) On the syntactic aspect, FLn is expanded as follows (where n is a positive integer): (i) Language J is expanded into a language Jdh in which a finite definition H = {s1,. sn, d1,., dn} additional non-connectives in which si's are truth-stressed hedges, and di's truthdepressing units are. (ii) The definition of formulas is broadened by adding the following: If A is a formula and h is an ix, ii is a formula."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we extend fuzzy logic in the narrower sense by many hedge combinations to provide a basis for the presentation and argumentation of human knowledge. In fuzzy logic in the narrower sense, both syntax and semantics are gradually evaluated in [0,1]. The graduated approach to syntax can be seen as an elegant and natural generalization of classical logic for inferences under vagueness, since it allows to explicitly present and argue with partial truths, i.e. to prove partially true conclusions from partially true premises, and enjoys the Pavelka-like completeness. FLn is extended in two cases: (i) Each hedge has no dual, and (ii) each hedge can have its own dual. In addition to expanding the language and definition of formulas, new logical axioms are added that characterize the properties of hedge combinations."}, {"heading": "5.
