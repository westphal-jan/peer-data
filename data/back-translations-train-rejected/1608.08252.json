Deviant executions of a business process include those that violate compliance rules, or executions that undershoot or exceed performance targets. Deviance mining is concerned with uncovering the reasons for deviant executions by analyzing business process event logs. This article provides a systematic review and comparative evaluation of deviance mining approaches based on a family of data mining techniques known as sequence classification. Using real-life logs from multiple domains, we evaluate a range of feature types and classification methods in terms of their ability to accurately discriminate between normal and deviant executions of a process. We also analyze the interestingness of the rule sets extracted using different methods. We observe that feature sets extracted using pattern mining techniques only slightly outperform simpler feature sets based on counts of individual activity occurrences in a trace.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 21:14:01 GMT  (2878kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08252v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["hoang nguyen", "marlon dumas", "marcello la rosa", "fabrizio maria maggi", "suriadi suriadi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08252"}, "pdf": {"name": "1608.08252.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 8.08 252v 1 [cs.A I] 2 9A ug2 016ABusiness Process Deviance Mining: Review and EvaluationHOANG NGUYEN, Queensland University of Technology, Australia MARLON DUMAS, University of Tartu, Estonia MARCELLO LA ROSA, Queensland University of Technology, Australia FABRIZIO MARIA MAGGI, University of Tartu, Estonia SURIADI SURIADI, Queensland University of Technology, AustraliaBusiness Process Deviance refers to the phenomenon of a subset of business process executions deviating in a negative or positive manner with respect to their expected or desirable results.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "It includes, among other things, procedures for the automated discovery of process models from event logs, techniques for verifying the conformity between a particular process model and an event log, and techniques for analyzing and predicting business processes based on event logs. This work deals with business processes that are executed on the basis of event logs - a family of process logs that aims to analyze event logs to explain why a business process deviates from its normal or expected execution. Such deviations can be negative or positive in nature - see the theory of positive deviation [Spreader and Sonenshein]. Positive deviation corresponds to executions that result in high process performance, such as achieving positive results with short execution times, low resource consumption or low costs."}, {"heading": "2.

EVALUATION SETUP", "text": "In this section the evaluation structure is introduced: First the used data sets are described, then the methods for feature extraction and classification."}, {"heading": "3.1. Datasets", "text": "We used six sets of data derived from five real-world event logs. We chose these data sets to cover the classification of \"normal\" and \"deviant\" cases based on time and non-time criteria. Note that case and track in this paper are interchangeable, as well as characteristics and patterns. In the former criterion, the difference between deviating and normal cases based on process duration is w.r.t. a duration threshold (i.e. slow vs. normal processes); in the latter criterion, the difference between case types depends on an outcome attribute of the case (e.g. missing or successful results).The six logs fall into two sets (including the first two logs in Table I and II). Software behavior [Lo et al. 2009] These two logs contain conclusions in which each event is a software command."}, {"heading": "3.2. Model construction", "text": "Considering a marked event log (i.e. a log in which each track is designated as \"normal\" or \"deviant\"), the first stage of character acquisition (< f1 >, l) is where the individual types transform into a vector space using standard classification techniques. In this context, a set of characteristics is converted into a vector of characteristics (< f1 >, l) in which the value of each characteristic is used for identification and marking (normal or deviant).The value is the number of characteristics in the track. We use a selection technique such as that used in [Cheng et al]. 2008] and [Lo et al]. This technique selects a characteristic based on the weight of its statistical correlation with the result classes."}, {"heading": "4. ACCURACY EVALUATION", "text": "We measured the accuracy of the prediction in relation to the standard term of accuracy defined as tp + tntp + tn 3688% of the results for 3688, where tp is the number of tracks correctly classified as deviating (true positives), tn is the number of tracks correctly classified as normal (true negatives), fp is the number of false positives and fn is the number of false negatives. In addition, we also report on the range below the ROC curve (AUC) of each classifier. The AUC corresponds to the probability that a random negative sample is higher than a random positive sample in the list of samples most likely to belong to the deviating class. AUC has shown that the accuracy of classification techniques is suitable for both balanced and unbalanced datasets. [Er and Garcia 2009] This choice makes the results more comparable across datasets."}, {"heading": "5. RULES INTERESTINGNESS EVALUATION", "text": "We extracted rules from the six sets of data on seven interesting attribute types using decision tree classifiers. This technique takes the path from one leaf node of the tree to the top as a rule. All decision trees are formed with uniform input parameters. As a result, there are seven rule sets for each set, one per attribute type. The rule takes the form of A = > B, where antecedent A is a combination of several selectors in the form of attribute OP as a relational operator. For each data set, we compare the quality of these rule sets on a number of selected metrics and observe the effect of pattern types on rule quality. The metrics used in our evaluation include: \u2022 Rule Length: the number of operators in the antecedent part of the rule. This is averaged from all rules of a rule set. \u2022% Generalization al al al al al."}, {"heading": "5.1. Patterns and Rules", "text": "Across all data sets and functional types, we observe that patterns with a high Fisher score are often chosen to form rules with high coverage based on the number of cases covered, which is justified because the decision tree would include these patterns as the preferred splitting pattern based on their strong discriminatory power (Gini index is used for the decision tree in our experiment).The higher the Fisher score of a pattern, the more rules they participate in and the higher the coverage these rules have. Several representative examples are reviewed in detail as follows. In particular, IP / Schedule provides a remarkable pattern: \"364 198 361\" (each number represents an activity).The associated rule with high coverage is: IF \"364 198 361\" \u2265 0.500 THEN, which means that if this pattern occurs, the track would have a bad result. Conversely, no IA-based rules are formed based on these three events, which means no individually resulting activity."}, {"heading": "5.2. Rules Interestingness Measures", "text": "Differential metrics are used to evaluate the quality of a set of rules. Rule length is calculated by determining the average length of individual rules.% Generalization is calculated by formula (1). For probability-based measures, cumulative interest is calculated by first sorting rules within a set of rules in decreasing order of measurements, and then accumulating these values from the highest to the lowest. Cumulative measurement for one type of feature is visualized as an upward curve based on the number of rules (Fig. 10,11,12). Our observation is summarized as follows: The graphs selected for illustration due to the space limitation. For the set of rules, the IP-based rulebook consistently has a high interest over the others, except for the TR and TRA are the best (Fig. 10)."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our prior art review found that existing business process deviance mining techniques are based on the extraction of patterns from business processes that either use individual activity frequency or frequent or discriminatory pattern mining approaches. Empirical evaluation has shown that in the context of structured (predictable) business processes, pattern mining approaches significantly exceed the basic approach in terms of accuracy. On the other hand, in the case of business processes with high levels of variability, the accuracy improvement achieved through the use of pattern minerals is negligible. The latter observation suggests that when business processes exhibit high variability, no clear composite patterns arise, and that such patterns do not add predictable power over simple activity numbers. However, we observed that the use of composite patterns (be they frequent or discriminatory) generally have positive effects on the interest of reduced rule sets."}], "references": [{"title": "A new framework for itemset generation", "author": ["Charu C Aggarwal", "Philip S Yu."], "venue": "Proc. of PODS.

Deviant executions of a business process include those that violate compliance rules, or executions that undershoot or exceed performance targets. Deviance mining is concerned with uncovering the reasons for deviant executions by analyzing business process event logs. This article provides a systematic review and comparative evaluation of deviance mining approaches based on a family of data mining techniques known as sequence classification. Using real-life logs from multiple domains, we evaluate a range of feature types and classification methods in terms of their ability to accurately discriminate between normal and deviant executions of a process. We also analyze the interestingness of the rule sets extracted using different methods. We observe that feature sets extracted using pattern mining techniques only slightly outperform simpler feature sets based on counts of individual activity occurrences in a trace.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
