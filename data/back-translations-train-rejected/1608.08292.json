Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we propose novel solutions to two of the fundamental but interrelated problems of PPS. The first concerns the formation of energy-based balance groups within a particular class of customers. In this paper, multi-family houses are considered as customers. To solve the group-building problem, we apply a Bayesian MCMC-based dividend strategy that includes a statistical measure (periodic standard deviation of demand from each customer) and generates a number of balance groups. The purpose of creating a balance group is to select similar customers whose aggregate demand has greater predictability, which helps PPS plan the supply contract. Bayesian MCMC proves to be an effective aggregation strategy that not only provides appropriate grouping, but also provides important demand-centric insights into each group (e.g. the ceiling on the storage capacity required to reduce the imbalance of actual demand)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The authors would like to thank Digital Grid Co., Ltd. and the University of Tokyo.
