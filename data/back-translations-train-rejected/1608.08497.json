This task is fraught with difficulties and uncertainty, making the knowledge provided by human experts essential for successful assessment. Today, the increasing number of progressively complex systems has led to an urgent need to produce tools that support the expert-led process of system-security assessment. In this research, we use weighted averages (WAs) and ordered weighted averages (OWAs) with evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to create aggregation operators that model parts of the assessment process. We show how individual overall ratings for security components can be produced from ratings of their characteristics, and how these individual overall ratings can be aggregated to produce overall rankings of potential attacks on a system. As well as the identification of salient attacks and weak points in a prospective system, the proposed method also highlights which factors and security components contribute most to a component's difficulty and attack ranking respectively. A real world scenario is used in which experts were asked to rank a set of technical attacks, and to answer a series of questions about the security components that are the subject of the attacks. The work shows how finding good aggregation operators, and identifying important components and factors of a cyber-security problem can be automated. The resulting operators have the potential for use as decision aids for systems designers and cyber-security experts, increasing the amount of assessment that can be achieved with the limited resources available.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 15:21:42 GMT  (617kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08497v1", "Computers and Security, Volume 62, September 2016, Pages 229-245"]], "COMMENTS": "Computers and Security, Volume 62, September 2016, Pages 229-245", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CR", "authors": ["simon miller", "christian wagner", "uwe aickelin", "jonathan m garibaldi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08497"}, "pdf": {"name": "1608.08497.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Modelling Cyber-Security Experts\u2019 Decision Making Processes using Aggregation Operators", "authors": ["Simon Miller", "Christian Wagner", "Uwe Aickelin", "Jonathan M.

Introduction", "text": "Because the use of malware in everyday life for tasks such as internet banking, e-commerce and e-government can be highly insecure, the risk of cyber crime is a growing concern (see Detica and Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (2011), Anderson et al. (2013) and Cruz et al. (2014)). Assessing security risks associated with proposed systems at their design stage is a non-trivial task that involves managing multiple sources of uncertain information. For example, it is very difficult to estimate the cost of a successful attack, the likelihood of a rare attack, because the tools and technologies available to attackers / defenders are constantly changing (Tregear, 2001). Due to these difficulties, a large amount of expertise is required to carry out such assessments. Typically, cyber security experts are employed as they can provide comprehensive assessments based on considerable expertise and insight, while being able to assess the feasibility of existing cyber security tools and software processes (e.g. anti-malware)."}, {"heading": "2. Background", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Cyber-Security Assessment", "text": "Nowadays, the use of the Internet and mobile networks has become the norm 4. Although a variety of everyday tasks including banking, email, e-government, e-commerce, VOIP, social networks and mobile telecommunications, an increasing number of sensitive interactions are taking place online, leaving them vulnerable to attacks by cyber criminals who can read, modify or delete from the ground up. At the same time, the volume and availability of tools to support attackers in their actions is also increasing. These tools lower the barrier to entry for attackers, since far less technical expertise is required to operate them than to launch an attack from scratch. Accumulation of the situation is also the fact that it is often unclear how defensive security products achieve their claims, namely whether they are effective at all."}, {"heading": "2.2.

Evolutionary Algorithms", "text": "The most popular EA, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) (see Holland (1975) and Goldberg et al. (1989)), begins by generating a random initial population of solutions, using fitness-based selection and copy, crossover, and mutation operators to come up with near-optimal solutions. GA's advantage is that it is able to browse a large area of the solution space while evaluating a small percentage of possible solutions, which is critical for problems like those seen in this paper, where there are many more possible solutions than they are practical to evaluate. The use of a GA to search for suitable OWA weights is demonstrated in Nettleton and Torra (2001) and Torra (2011), and in our own previous work, Oagents significantly expands the weights of the OAA."}, {"heading": "2.5. Statistical Analysis", "text": "Spearman's Rho (Spearman, 1904), also known as Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficent, measures the statistical dependence of two ranking data. The coefficient is a number in [-1,1] that indicates the degree of correlation; 1 stands for a perfect positive correlation; 0 means there is no correlation, and -1 stands for a perfect negative correlation. Pearson's r (Pearson, 1895) is used to measure the correlation between component characteristics and overall difficulties. Carson's r, also known as Pearson ProductMoment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC), is a method that measures linear correlation between two sets of values (interval or ratio data); a value of zero indicates no correlation and a value of one indicates a perfect correlation. In both methods, values above 0.5 are generally interpreted as strong correlation."}, {"heading": "2.6. Experimental Validation", "text": "The experimental results and statistical analyses presented in this paper are not formally tested against predetermined null hypotheses or similar, as Tukey 1962 (Tukey, 1962) discussed. The general validation of experimental methods in this paper is presented with respect to the degree to which it is possible to model parts of decision-making processes in the field of cyber security using statistical aggregation of components within attack vectors. As this is explorative, there are no explicit tests for falsification - however, there is an informal null hypothesis that security \"experts\" are not experts and that no correlations, associations or aggregations could be found linking the evaluation of subcomponents to rankings of attack vectors. However, the main purpose of this work is to conduct exploratory data analyses to explore the extent to which it is possible to link future analyses with new methods of hypotheses that could perform systematic evaluation."}, {"heading": "3.

Thirty-nine highly experienced GCHQ cybersecurity experts, including system and software architects, technical security consultants, penetration testers, vulnerability researchers, and specialized systems assessors, participated in decision-making.

OWA/WA Aggregation", "text": "The methodology in this paper is based on determining the \"optimal\" weights for WA or WA aggregating the assessment of the difficulty of compromising the various components in a number of attack vectors. This, in turn, allows both the ranking of attack vectors in terms of their overall difficulty and providing an understanding of which components in a security system contribute most / least to an overall system that is compromised. Below we will briefly outline the methodology and detailed reasoning for both the WA and the OWA. In all, 26 security components have been evaluated, each belonging to one or more of the stated technical attacks. Table 2 lists the attacks, and their constituent security components. Note that some components appear more than once in the same attack, this is more than one instance of a component that needs to be attacked."}, {"heading": "4.2.

From Factor Ratings to Security Component Ratings", "text": "In this section, we will use the described EA to perform a search for WA weights. In these experiments, we will show how the overall difficulty assessments for safety components can be derived from assessments of their properties using WAs where the weights were detected using an EA. In addition to generating overall difficulty assessments, this process will also show which questions contribute most / least to the overall assessments. In this case, it is not rankings that are compared, but ratings. Therefore, Spearman's RHO is not a suitable comparison method, so an alternative method for calculating fitness has been established. The \"error\" is calculated directly by taking into account the sum of absolute differences between the derived hop assessments and the actual hop assessments of the experts. Each expert's error value is then used to calculate an MSE value for all the experts, which is used as the fitness value for each solution."}, {"heading": "5.1.

Extended Experiments", "text": "In these extensive experiments, the best EA configuration found for each question is used in 30 runs with different random seeds. The purpose of these experiments is to assess the consistency of the EAs and to see the best results we can reasonably expect with the EA. In experiments with the attack question, the best configuration (test 15) is used; Appendix B shows that several configurations have achieved the best result for the circumvention question, from which we have chosen arbitrarily to use the configuration from test 1. Table B.7 shows a summary of the results for the attack question. The results are extremely stable, there is little difference in the results over the 30 runs. Table B.8 gives details of the best WA found.] [Table 8 about here.] [Table 9 about here.] The results of the attack question experiments show that there are clear differences in the relative meaning of each question."}, {"heading": "6. From Security Component Ratings to Attack Rankings", "text": "In this section, we describe how the EA was used to search for OWA weights. OWAs are to be used to aggregate the general levels of difficulty of security components to create attack difficulty rankings. In these experiments, three expert groups were used: Odd Experts, i.e. experts assigned an odd number, even experts, i.e. experts assigned an even number and all experts. This was done so that OWAs discovered with a group (i.e. odd) can be applied to the alternative group (i.e. even) to assess their robustness, and the entire group can be used to obtain the best OWAs that can be found for the entire expert group for comparison purposes. Advanced experiments are used with the best configuration found with the entire group to test the stability of the configuration and to further explore the best OWAs that can be found."}, {"heading": "6.1. EA Configuration", "text": "First, a series of experiments was conducted to find ideal EA configurations for use in these tests. Details of these experiments and their results can be found in Appendix A.1. The best OWAs found are presented in Table B.4 and the best results from these experiments are presented in Table B.13. The best OWAs found for the odd and even groups are evaluated for their robustness, and the best EA configuration for the entire group is used in advanced experiments. [Table 13 about here]"}, {"heading": "6.2. OWA Robustness", "text": "To assess the robustness of the OWAs found by the EA, the best OWAs found for the odd group were applied to the straight group and vice versa, and the results of these experiments are provided in Table B.14. It can be seen that while there is some deterioration in performance when the OWAs are applied to the alternative group, they produce rankings that are strongly correlated with the actual rankings of the experts (i.e., Spearman's Rho > 0.5 indicates a strong correlation), which indicates that they are robust. Since these OWAs work well in their alternative (invisible) group, it is to be expected that OWAs trained with random data will work well on invisible data. [Table 14 on this.] 6.3. Advanced experiments take the best configuration found in the entire grouping, and perform 30 runs of different random seeds to give an assessment of the stability of the OAs, and to allow for a better understanding of the EAs to be expected on the basis of the expected."}, {"heading": "7. From Factor Ratings to Attack Rankings", "text": "In this section, we will use the best WAs and OWAs, as described in the previous sections, to derive the ranking of attacks from the assessments of the difficulty factors; this is a two-step process: First, the best WAs are used to calculate the overall difficulty ratings for security components from the assessments of the factors of this difficulty; second, the derived overall difficulty ratings are summarized using the best OWA to compile attack ratings. Table B.17 shows the WA and OWA operators used, and Table B.18 gives a summary of the results. Note that in this case, ranking pairs as such are compared by subtracting the Rho value of the spearhead from 1, as in Section 6. For this reason, one can see that the minimal error is the complement of the maximum Spearman's Rho, as they refer to the same person. In the previous experiments, where the overall difficulty components of the Rho are calculated from the safety components, the experts have been compared by comparing the difficulty components of the difficulty components of the 17."}, {"heading": "8. Discussion", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take a few days to reach an agreement."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have presented a method to find good aggregation operators for generating rankings of technical attacks on a proposed system and assessments of security components, with the added benefit of highlighting prominent factors and security components as well. To do this, we have used a data set collected during a decision-making process at GCHQ in which cyber security experts performed security assessment tasks based on a realistic system proposal. Results showed that with the proposed method, it is possible to assess rankings of technical attacks on a system using assessments of security components, assessments of security components based on assessments of certain factors, and these results show the ability to reduce assessments of generic security components (or their properties) in scenarios to assess the impact of changing / shifting components within a system design. Work has yielded important insights that allow the construction of security assessment tools that provide expert support through tools that have the potential to require system designers, the tools, and the time and resources required for system development."}, {"heading": "10.

Part 1 - Evolutionary Operator Proportions", "text": "Table B.19 shows the configurations tested in the first part. For all these experiments, 1% elitism was applied to a population of 250 + 250 generations. Population and generational values were arbitrarily selected to explore operator proportions. Adequate values for population and generations are investigated in later experiments. [Table 19 on this subject.] The best results for these experiments are given in Table B.20. Results for all three groups show that configurations with a high proportion of mutations and a smaller proportion of crossover experiments work best and that the proportion of copy has little impact on the results. As the best individuals are automatically copied via elitism from one generation to the next, this can reduce the impact of the copier. Table B.21 provides details of the OWAs found in each of the best experiments listed in Table B.20.

It should be noted that in the first part of the tests, two configurations were best for the entire group, both were tested in this part. The best result for the whole group was obtained in Table B.23 with operator proportions from test 2. In this group of experiments, there are much less deviations in the results than in the first part of the tests; the change in operator proportions had a greater impact on the results than the change in population sizes and number of generations.

This task is fraught with difficulties and uncertainty, making the knowledge provided by human experts essential for successful assessment. Today, the increasing number of progressively complex systems has led to an urgent need to produce tools that support the expert-led process of system-security assessment. In this research, we use Weighted Averages (WAs) and Ordered Weighted Averages (OWAs) with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to create aggregation operators that model parts of the assessment process. We show how individual overall ratings for security components can be produced from ratings of their characteristics, and how these individual overall ratings can be aggregated to produce overall rankings of potential attacks on a system. As well as the identification of salient attacks and weak points in a prospective system, the proposed method also highlights which factors and security components contribute most to a component\u2019s difficulty and attack ranking respectively. A real world scenario is used in which experts were asked to rank a set of technical attacks, and to answer a series of questions about the security components that are the subject of the attacks. The work shows how finding good aggregation operators, and identifying important components and factors of a cyber-security problem can be automated. The resulting operators have the potential for use as decision aids for systems designers and cyber-security experts, increasing the amount of assessment that can be achieved with the limited resources available.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
