Multi-label classification is one of the actively researched machine learning paradigm that has gained much attention in the recent years due to its rapidly increasing real world applications. In contrast to traditional binary and multi-class classification, multi-label classification involves association of each of the input samples with a set of target labels simultaneously. There are no real-time online neural network based multi-label classifier available in the literature. In this paper, we exploit the inherent nature of high speed exhibited by the extreme learning machines to develop a novel online real-time classifier for multi-label data streams. The developed classifier is experimented with datasets from different application domains for consistency, performance and speed. The experimental studies show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of speed and accuracy and can classify multi-label data streams in real-time.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 15:14:06 GMT  (1007kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08905v1", "8 pages, 7 tables, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1609.00086"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 7 tables, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1609.00086", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["rajasekar venkatesan", "meng joo er", "shiqian wu", "mahardhika pratama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08905"}, "pdf": {"name": "1608.08905.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Novel Online Real-time Classifier for Multi-label Data Streams", "authors": ["Rajasekar Venkatesan", "Meng Joo Er", "Shiqian Wu", "Mahardhika Pratama"], "emails": ["RAJA0046@e.ntu.edu.sg", "EMJER@ntu.edu.sg", "shiqian.wu@wust.edu.cn", "m.pratama@latrobe.edu.au"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "A.

Performance Metrics", "text": "The complexity of multi-label problems leads to a unique feature of multi-label classifiers, the so-called partial correctness of results. Since both the number of labels and the label identities must be predicted by the multi-label classifier, the problem of partial correctness arises. The classifier can incorrectly predict either the number of labels corresponding to an input sample or the identity of the corresponding target labels. Therefore, the hammer loss measurement is used to quantify the performance of the classifier, longitudinally with accuracy, precision, recall and formula 1. Hammer loss is calculated as a fraction of false labels to the total number of labels. Hammer loss for an ideal classifier is zero. Training time and testing time of the proposed technology are also evaluated and compared with the state of the art."}, {"heading": "B.

novel extreme learning machine based online multi-label classifier for real-time data streams is proposed. Multi-label classification is one of the actively researched machine learning paradigm that has gained much attention in the recent years due to its rapidly increasing real world applications. In contrast to traditional binary and multiclass classification, multi-label classification involves association of each of the input samples with a set of target labels simultaneously. There are no real-time online neural network based multi-label classifier available in the literature. In this paper, we exploit the inherent nature of high speed exhibited by the extreme learning machines to develop a novel online realtime classifier for multi-label data streams. The developed classifier is experimented with datasets from different application domains for consistency, performance and speed. The experimental studies show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of speed and accuracy and can classify multi-label data streams in real-time.
