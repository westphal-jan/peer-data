Below, we present our research on these two classes. To our knowledge, there is not a single work in the current literature that compares big data predictive analytics for orbit prediction in real-time."}, {"heading": "2.1 Time-series, Real-time Analysis Tools", "text": "There are two logical methods of process data streams: maintaining a small number of elements that characterize the data stream (and often the application we are tackling), and requiring much smaller space and time to process it. Fixed parts of the data are loaded into a memory buffer, and the machine algorithms are applied only when they also take into account past performance for optimization."}, {"heading": "2.2 Trajectory Prediction Models", "text": "In terms of models for predicting moving models and maneuvers used in recent literature, they can be divided into three categories that take into account their dimensional space: 1-D, 2-D and 3-D. The 3-D models are commonly used in air traffic control systems, and 1-D and 2-D models are commonly used in land and maritime systems [19]. If a single model cannot capture the required behavior of a target, a multiple model approach has also been proposed. In [20] Ristic et al, we use historical AIS ship motion patterns to predict the movement of a ship based on the Gaussian sum filter."}, {"heading": "3 Approach", "text": "As mentioned above, the central challenge facing this work revolved around the real-time prediction of the trajectories of seagoing ships using real data streams that communicate their position, direction, ID and some other metadata. This research is motivated by the fact that providing valid and accurate estimates of future ship positions includes valuable knowledge for decision-making processes by shipowners, insurance companies, coastguards, port management, etc. The prediction model is based on the premise that a ship's past behavior can help to derive knowledge about its future position. As we refer to data streams, it is crucial to clarify that the definition of past behavior is subtle and largely depends on time and computational resource constraints. As shown in [26], when large amounts of historical motion recordings are available and multiple scans of the data can be tolerated, the results can be remarkably accurate."}, {"heading": "3.1 Baseline work", "text": "In our previous paper [6], we used a fixed time window processing model and applied a series of semi-supervised learning methods. The key concept is that for each batch fed into the algorithm, the prediction was measured against the actual position, which was then reported in the immediate future, using an iterative process to refine the model. Thus, the performance of the prediction algorithm was such that the result was at least one unit of time ahead of the record with the predicted position. Each algorithm made a prediction with the fixed window stack and evaluated itself by performing a training step against the actual position. All algorithms suffered from the cold start problem, especially because there was no distinction between the semantics of the vessels, i.e. each vessel record was treated as a record that contributed equally to the model. This simply means that there was no separation of models between vessels, geographic areas or other distinct parameters of the model, even if there were clear intuitions reported in our previous paper [26]."}, {"heading": "3.2 Assumptions and approach", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this project is a project, which is a project that is, first and foremost, a project that aims to put people's needs at the centre and, first and foremost, to put people's needs at the centre."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data and pre-Processing", "text": "The data set included 1,315,474 AIS entries relating to 2,874 unique vessels, including all types of vessels (cargo, tankers and passenger vessels, fishing boats and recreational craft) operating in the Aegean Sea (especially in the range of latitude from 36,08462 to 39,48708 and length from 24,45557 to 26,58691), for a period of 30 days starting on 1 November 2014. To satisfy this need, we use the entire data set and apply 10-fold cross validation, using the same split in all models. When implementing the real-time data stream analysis service, we need to maintain a number of entries in order to evaluate our system."}, {"heading": "4.2 Machine Learning Models", "text": "We constructed two models for each set of different \"prediction interval\" fields, one for predicting latitude, and one for longitude, and tested various applicable configurations that flirt with the models \"input features (latitude, longitude, speed, course). However, some combinations of the set of these options were not feasible, while some other parameters such as the instances taken into account for training and evaluating the model. A particular example refers to the amount of subsequent data sets in a 20\" time interval. The results show the superiority of a 10-node training, multi-layer perception."}, {"heading": "4.3 Evaluation of the real-time data-stream analysis service", "text": "This year, the number of new arrivals to the US is many times higher than in previous years."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "This work focuses on modelling the trajectory of ships through real-time analysis, monitoring, spatio-temporal time series. The model does not make assumptions and categorisations between ship characteristics, nor does it take into account application semantics, but rather attempts to process the data stream as it arrives, provided that each new dataset equally contributes to a single trajectory forecasting model. This limitation is set to ensure the replicability and scalability of the model, to any moving object-object forecasting model. Unlike previous approaches, which considered specific implementations of machine learning algorithms, in this work we use a forward model based on traditional multi-scan machine learning algorithms. We show that the model can help with real-time queries that achieve better accuracy than simple kinematic learning model 31."}, {"heading": "6 References", "text": "[1] \"Large-Scale Data Analysis Using Machine Learning Framework for Trajectory Prediction Algorithms over Ququiuous Data.\" [Online] Available: http: / / sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov / SBIR / abstracts / 14 / sbirselect / phase1 / SBIR-14-1-S-A20.018672.html.
