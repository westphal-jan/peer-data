Therefore, k-monotone functions are natural generalizations of the classical monotone functions, which are the 1-monotone functions. Motivated by the recent interest in k-monotone functions in the context of circuit complexity and learning theory, and by the central role that monotonicity testing plays in the context of property testing, we initiate a systematic study of k-monotone functions, in the property testing model. In this model, the goal is to distinguish functions that are k-monotone (or are close to being k-monotone) from functions that are far from being k-monotone. Our results include the following: 1. We demonstrate a separation between testing k-monotonicity and testing monotonicity, on the hypercube domain {0, 1}d, for k \u2265 3; 2. We demonstrate a separation between testing and learning on {0, 1}d, for k = \u03c9(log d): testing k-monotonicity can be performed with 2 \u221a d\u00b7log d\u00b7log 1/\u03b5) queries, while learning k-monotone functions requires 2 \u221a d\u00b71/\u03b5) queries (Blais et al. (RANDOM 2015)). 3. We present a tolerant test for functions f : [n] \u2192 {0, 1} with complexity independent of n, which makes progress on a problem left open by Berman et al. (STOC 2014). Our techniques exploit the testing-by-learning paradigm, use novel applications of Fourier analysis on the grid [n], and draw connections to distribution testing techniques. \u2217Columbia University.
