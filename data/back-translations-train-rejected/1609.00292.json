In order to save the budget, it is important to ensure a high quality of crowdsourcing labels, thereby reducing the total cost of collecting labels. Since the self-confidence of workers often has a close relationship to their skills, one possible method of quality control is to require workers to work on problems only when they feel safe by offering them an uncertain option. On the other hand, the possibility of enabling workers to use the uncertain option also leads to the potential risk of budget wastage. In this work, we propose analysing whether providing an uncertain option actually leads to a significant cost reduction, as well as setting the trust threshold. We also propose an online mechanism that represents an alternative to threshold selection, when crowd sourcing is difficult to estimate: the safe distribution of the ability of the crowdsourcing option."}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "In recent years, crowdsourcing has become a popular method of collecting labels. The power of crowdsourcing rests on two conditions: one is to get a highly accurate assessment of the true labels by compiling the labels of workers; the other is that the cost of collecting labels is not great, so it is much more economical than recruiting the experts."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "In fact, most work focuses on accurately estimating the underlying labels (Raykar et al., 2012; Dalvi et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015).The aim of this work is to improve learning performance, without directly factoring in the cost of label collection., 2016; Dalvi et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015., 2016; the cost of label collection."}, {"heading": "3. Problem Formulation", "text": "We consider the tasks of binary label collecting and the adoption of the well-known Dawid-Skene model (Dawid and Skene, 1979; Zhou et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014; Karger et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2015; Li and Yu, 2014) under the binary classification case. Under the D-S model, the tasks are assumed to be homogeneous, meaning that the potential costs for different tasks are the same. As a result, in the rest of the paper, we focus on dealing with the costs of a single task. We assume the anonymous adoption of the workers introduced in Karger et al. (2011) for mass modeling. Denoting situation i as an employee's ability, i.e. the probability that the returned label is correct, the process of selecting a number of anonymous workers is presented as independent."}, {"heading": "4. Analysis on Quality Ensured Mechanisms", "text": "In this section, we focus on examining quality-assured mechanisms that ensure that labels are only accepted when the ability is above the threshold. We propose analyzing the characteristics that the crowd-ability distribution should fulfill in order to be effective. Analysis is based on simple statistics of crowd-ability distribution, such as mean and variance, which can be estimated when sufficiently described gold standard examples are available. In this section, the aim is to show the main framework of analysis that forms the basis for analyzing the uncertain mechanism that is in Section 5.To show that a quality-assured mechanism is effective, it is necessary to compare the complexity of both situations with and without the mechanism."}, {"heading": "5. Analysis on Unsure Mechanisms", "text": "In this section, we begin to consider unsafe mechanisms. In the previous analysis, quality-assured mechanisms guarantee that the accuracy of the labels returned is actually above T. However, due to the discrepancy between self-confidence and ability, an unsafe mechanism is no guarantee of this characteristic. In particular, if one is confident about his / her work, it is indeed possible that this confidence is so misleading that the actual ability is below 1 / 2. This is a pessimistic assumption of the mass, since it is assumed that an employee will always be overconfident about his / her work. Recall, which is carried out under quality-assured mechanisms, is the main contract term for cost-related is1 (2T \u2212 1) 2 prs. Under unsafe mechanisms, only the confidence of an employee is available."}, {"heading": "6. Discussion on Payment Strategy", "text": "The above analysis assumes that the return of labels and the choice of an insecure option are paid equally. To avoid this problem, it is helpful to devise alternative incentive-compatible payment methods (Shah and Zhou, 2015). As an example, the following payment method can be used: We assume that the choice of an insecure option is paid for honest behavior, assuming that workers are eager to opt for a higher-paid option when their confidence is high, avoiding the risk caused by accidental guessing. It is not difficult to generalize the analysis to this method, as there is only a constant scaling of costs in different ways."}, {"heading": "7. Online Algorithm with Unsure Option", "text": "For the practice of insecure setting, it is important to determine the confidence threshold T. After prior analysis, the confidence threshold T = 1 verse = 1 verse can be transferred to the problem of estimating some simple statistics of crowdsourcing tasks. If sufficient examples are not available, it is difficult to perform statistical estimates with satisfactory accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose an online algorithm based on the bandit setting. We assume that standard golden examples are only used for labor force verification mechanisms, as in Section 5.The task is to correctly select confidence threshold T, which can be treated as bandit arms. We can model the crowdsourcing process as the following bandit game: When a new task comes, a random worker is pulled from the crowd, and a confidence threshold T is updated by some bandit algorithms."}, {"heading": "8. Experiments", "text": "We use synthetic data to test the theoretical results and the on-line bandit algorithm. In the experiments, a series of binary labeling tasks is generated, and the ground-truth labels are uniformly scanned from {\u2212 1, 1}. Workers \"ability is scanned from beta distributions, with the parameters {\u03b1, \u03b2} being selected as {0.55, 0.5}, {1.1, 1} and {2.2, 2}. The corresponding mean is 0.52 and the variances are 0.1217, 0.0805 and 0.0480. The goal is to simulate the polarized, uniform and uni-modal cases of crowd-ability distributions with an average close to 1 / 2. Once the ability of an employee i is scanned, the label described is scanned from a Bernoulli random procedure, setting the random draw with parameter variations. The uncertain mechanism is used as described in Section 5, to safely refer to the inscription for the worker."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusions", "text": "We show that simple statistics on distribution, i.e. mean and variance, are sufficient to investigate the effectiveness of an uncertain mechanism. Motivated by theoretical analysis, we also propose an online algorithm to determine the trust threshold. Future work is to consider a more comprehensive modeling of tasks and crowds, then more complex crowdsourcing scenarios can be worked on. We also hope that our work will be a motivation for further studies on how crowdsourcing learning can be supported by the use of subjective insecurity among workers."}], "references": [{"title": "Large-scale markov decision problems with kl control cost and its application to crowdsourcing", "author": ["Y.

For saving budget, it is important to ensure high quality of the crowd-sourced labels, hence the total cost on label collection will be reduced. Since the self-confidence of workers often has close relationship with their abilities, a possible way for quality control is to request workers to work on problems only when they feel confident, by means of providing unsure option to them. On the other hand, allowing workers to choose unsure option also leads to the potential danger of budget waste. In this work, we propose the analysis towards understanding when providing unsure option indeed leads to significant cost reduction, as well as how the confidence threshold is set. We also propose an online mechanism, which is alternative for threshold selection when the estimation of the crowd ability distribution is difficult.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
