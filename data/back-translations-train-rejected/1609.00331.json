Unverifiability of Software", "text": "Unverifiability has important consequences not only for mathematicians and philosophers of relative verification, but has also recently become an important issue in software and hardware verification, which can be regarded as special cases of verification [18, 19]. Like much of the published mathematical evidence, software is known to contain enormous amounts of errors [71], perhaps up to 50 per thousand lines of code 2, but perhaps up to 2,3 [72]. Similarly, intended interpretations are abstract machines, just as with mathematical evidence. If their intended interpretations are target machines, then we encounter the problem of determining the reliability of the verification programs themselves (\"How do we verify programs?\")."}, {"heading": "5.1 Artificial Intelligence Unverifiability", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "Our early work suggests that the \"verifier\" could be examined as a new mathematical object of interest for future studies and predicts a significant benefit from our improved understanding of the subject. For example, an artificially intelligent verifier could be used to re-examine all previously published mathematical evidence, thereby greatly increasing the accuracy of all evidence that depends on previous work. Problems such as the infinite relapse of verifiers may be insoluble, but methods such as probabilistic verification should be able to give us as much certainty as we are willing to pay for it. Any progress in the proposed \"verifier theory\" will have additional benefits beyond its contribution to mathematics by making it possible to design safer advanced artificial intelligence, an issue that is set to become one of the greatest problems in science in the coming decades [85, 86]."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The author is grateful to Kenneth Regan, Edward Frenkel, and Sebastien Zany for valuable advice on this subject.
