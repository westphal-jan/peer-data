However, our understanding of citation behavior has been limited to small-scale manual citation analysis. We perform the largest behavioral study of citations to date, analyzing how citations are both framed and taken up by scholars in one entire field: natural language processing. We introduce a new dataset of nearly 2,000 citations annotated for function and centrality, and use it to develop a state-of-the-art classifier and label the entire ACL Reference Corpus. We then study how citations are framed by authors and use both papers and online traces to track how citations are followed by readers. We demonstrate that authors are sensitive to discourse structure and publication venue when citing, that online readers follow temporal links to previous and future work rather than methodological links, and that how a paper cites related work is predictive of its citation count. Finally, we use changes in citation roles to show that the field of NLP is undergoing a significant increase in consensus.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 00:40:15 GMT  (154kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00435v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DL", "authors": ["david jurgens", "srijan kumar", "raine hoover", "dan mcfarland", "dan jurafsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00435"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.00435.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Citation Classification for Behavioral Analysis of a Scientific Field", "authors": ["David Jurgens", "Srijan Kumar", "Raine Hoover", "Dan McFarland", "Dan Jurafsky"], "emails": ["jurgens@stanford.edu", "srijan@cs.umd.edu", "raine@stanford.edu", "dmcfarla@stanford.edu", "jurafsky@stanford.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Quotations play a key role in scientific development. Quotations from an essay reinforce its arguments and link it to an intellectual lineage (Latour, 1987), while citations from an essay allow communities to evaluate its intellectual contribution and quality (Cole and Cole, 1971; Lindsey, 1980; Hirsch, 2005).

While research on citation function has been ongoing for a long time (Swales, 1986; White, 2004; Ding et al., 2014), there is still no field-scale dataset for the citation function, and so we still do not understand how the authors of a field citation formulate their citations and how this framing affects readers. Ding et al, 2004, we do not have a dataset function for the first thing, and there is still no dating thing in the association function."}, {"heading": "2 A Corpus for Citation Function", "text": "Quotations play a key role in supporting the contributions of authors during a scientific paper. Several schemes have been proposed for classifying these different roles, ranging from a handful of classes (Nanba and Okumura, 1999; Pham and Hoffmann, 2003) to twenty or more (Garfield, 1979; Garzone and Mercer, 2000). Although suitable for manual expert analysis, such schemes do not fit our goal of automatic field-scale classification. As they tend to be one-dimensional, they cannot characterize centrality or function (Swales, 1986), they often contain fine-grained distinctions that are too rare to identify detailed field or author knowledge (Ziman, 1968; Swales, 1990; Harwood, 2009). Motivated by the desire to examine large-scale trends in scientific behavior, we address these problems by unifying the common aspects of multiple approaches in a two-dimensional model."}, {"heading": "2.1 Classification Scheme", "text": "Our classification is based on two themes for the citation role: (1) citation centrality, which reflects whether the quote is used to position the post in a broader context, or is indispensable to understanding the post itself (Moravcsik and Murugesan, 1975; Chubin and Moitra, 1975; Swales, 1986; Latour, 1987; Valenzuela et al., 2015) and (2) citation function, which reflects the specific purpose a quote serves in the discourse, e.g. provides background information or serves as a contrast (Oppenheim and Renn, 1978; Spiegel-Russ, 1977; Teufel et al., 2006a; Garfield, 1979; Garzone and Mercer, 2000). These themes capture complementary information and, as we will see, disclose significant patterns in author behavior. (21For notational clarity, we use the term reference point for the work cited, and the citation for the 2016 topic, because we use the citation in the 1975 text, because it is considered to be a third potential subject)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Annotation Process and Dataset", "text": "Annotation Guidelines were created using a pilot study of 10 contributions from the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (ARC) (Bird et al., 2008). Annotators completed two rounds of pre-comments to discuss their process and design guidelines, all of which were then duplicated by two trained annotators using the Brat tool (Stenetorp et al., 2012) and then fully evaluated to ensure their quality. The quotation scheme was applied to a random sample of 52 papers from the ARC. Each paper was edited with ParsCit (Councill et al., 2008) to extract citations and their references. As expected from previous studies (Teufel et al., 2006a; Dong and Scha fer, 2011), some citation functions were rare, so we attempted to revise the rare classes SUTURE, CONTINUATION and MOTIVATION."}, {"heading": "3 Automatically Classifying Citations", "text": "The structure of a scientific article provides several clues to the purpose of a quote. Our work relies on several approaches (Herna \u0301 ndez-Alvarez and Gomez, 2016) to develop a classifier based on (1) structural characteristics that describe where the quote is located, (2) lexical and grammatical characteristics for the way the quote is described, (3) field characteristics that take into account the location or other external information, and (4) usage characteristics as the reference is quoted throughout the essay.

Scientific work usually follows a structured narration according to section: Introduction, Methodology, Results and Discussion (Skelton, 1994; Nwogu, 1997).Each part of the narration adopts argumentative steps designed to convince the reader of the claims of the work (Swales, 1986; Swales, 1990).We expect this narration to be reflected in the use of its quotations in sections, with this section reflecting the 1974, the framework for the hypothesis that section 1274 has been applied."}, {"heading": "5 Venues and Citation Patterns", "text": "We used the same experimental setup as in the previous section. Figure 3 shows citation function by location for the 134,127 citations. We note that similar locations have similar citation functions. Journals have the highest proportion of BACKGROUND citations, suggesting that their extra space and timing are better suited for positioning. Conference venues devote proportionately more space to contrast and comparison, presumably because new NLP work is presented at conferences for the first time and therefore a demonstration of the proposed technique is better than existing ones. Workshops, on the other hand, have relatively few comparisons and use more BACKGROUND; the experimental nature of workshop work probably leads to fewer potential comparative perspectives."}, {"heading": "6 Citation Network Navigation", "text": "s understanding of their behavior is an important part of the understanding of scientists collecting their goals and strategies. However, while human navigation has been extensively researched in hyper-networked networks such as Wikipedia (e.g. West and Leskovec (2012), we know very little about how scientists trawl through their citation networks (Rouse et al., 1982) and Whitehead Jr., and no studies have looked at real-world data tracking user behavior. Have readers generally followed links to methodologies to follow essential papers? ACL Anthology provides an opportunity to examine these questions in detail, as the anthology server logs allow us to estimate when readers follow quotes from one paper to another."}, {"heading": "7 Predicting Future Impact", "text": "The scientific narrative narrated by quotations provides the reader with support for his claims and technical competence (Latour, 1987, p. 34). This framework could influence the perception of the work and, ultimately, how it is received and quoted within the community (Shi et al., 2010). Is the narrative a paper constructed by quotation roles (the way it compares with related works, or motivates, or refers to the ultimate quotation number) to its reception? Experimental Setup To quantify the effects of quotation use, we test its ability to predict the cumulative number of citations received within the first five years of publication by a paper known to be highly representative of the final quotation number (Wang et al., 2013). Our base model consists of state-of-art features for predicting the quotation numbers (Yan et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2012; Chakraet al, 2014; Dong et, 2016; and Dong, 2014; and Dong, Dong, 2014)."}, {"heading": "8 The Growth of Rapid Discovery Science", "text": "As scientific fields evolve, new subfields are often based first on methodological technology, triggering a community discussion about the best way to use and improve technology (Moody, 2004).NLP has observed the emergence of several such subfields from the early grammatical approaches in the 1950s-1970s to the statistical revolution in the 1990s to the most recent methodological models (SPA, Jones, 2001; Anderson et al., 2012).Collins (1994) has suggested that one field can undergo a certain shift in what he calls rapid discovery science (a) achieves high consensus on research topics and methods, and (b) develops genealogies of methodological technologies that build on another. As a result of increased consensus, one field emphasizes the movement toward new research problems rather than reviewing the results of earlier approaches. Collins claims that this shift characterizes natural sciences, but not many social sciences that tend to emphasize this process."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "Using a new corpus with citation function and centrality, we develop a state-of-the-art classifier that identifies the importance of new uncontrolled features in relation to theme models and argumentation structures and identifies all quotations for an entire field (with all data and materials published at https: / / github. com / anon). Subsequently, we show that citation function and centrality reveal outstanding behaviors of writers, readers, and the field as a whole: (1) Authors are sensitive to discourse structure and place of quotation, (2) readers follow temporal thread ideas and not methodological threads when surfing citation networks, (3) the way in which an author relates their work to literature is predictable for the number of citations they receive, with the community preferring well-motivated works that integrate and compare with other works, and (4) the NLP field as a whole has an increased consensus - which is a quick reference to the science and a need for validated work."}], "references": [{"title": "Reference scope identification in citing sentences", "author": ["Amjad Abu-Jbara", "Dragomir Radev."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2012 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT),", "citeRegEx": "Abu.Jbara and Radev.,? 2012", "shortCiteRegEx": "Abu.Jbara and Radev.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Towards a computational history of the ACL: 1980-2008", "author": ["Ashton Anderson", "Dan McFarland", "Dan Jurafsky."], "venue": "Proceedings of the ACL-2012 Special Workshop on Rediscovering 50 Years of Discoveries, pages 13\u201321.", "citeRegEx": "Anderson et al\\.,? 2012", "shortCiteRegEx": "Anderson et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Sentiment analysis of scientific citations", "author": ["Awais Athar."], "venue": "Technical Report, University of Cambridge, Computer Laboratory.", "citeRegEx": "Athar.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Athar.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Circleview: Scalable visualization and navigation of citation networks", "author": ["Peter Bergstr\u00f6m", "E James Whitehead Jr."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2006 Symposium on Interactive Visual Information Collections and Activity (IVICA).

We perform the largest behavioral study of citations to date, analyzing how citations are both framed and taken up by scholars in one entire field: natural language processing. We introduce a new dataset of nearly 2,000 citations annotated for function and centrality, and use it to develop a state-of-the-art classifier and label the entire ACL Reference Corpus. We then study how citations are framed by authors and use both papers and online traces to track how citations are followed by readers. We demonstrate that authors are sensitive to discourse structure and publication venue when citing, that online readers follow temporal links to previous and future work rather than methodological links, and that how a paper cites related work is predictive of its citation count. Finally, we use changes in citation roles to show that the field of NLP is undergoing a significant increase in consensus.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
