Figure 2 shows the general workflow of algorithm selection. We will describe instance characteristics for the TTP later (in Section 5), but a simple feature is, for example, the number of cities. Based on these instance characteristics, we select an algorithm from a portfolio of 21 TTP algorithms that we have described in Section 4.2 to solve the instance at hand. The selection step is typically accomplished with machine learning. Based on collected training data (i.e. instance characteristics and performance data on training instances), we learn a machine learning model that maps from instance characteristics to a well-functioning algorithm."}, {"heading": "3.2 Popular Algorithm Selection Approaches", "text": "One of the first successful algorithm selection procedures for satisfaction problems was SATzilla [49]. Two main concepts were used: (i) Learning an empirical performance model [19, 25] that predicts the performance of an algorithm for a particular instance, and (ii) the static algorithm scheme [15, 21, 49], which provides a sequence of algorithms with a respective runtime budget. SATzilla uses such a static scheme for \"pre-compensation\" to solve simple instances without the compression of features. Other approaches include classification models (e.g. ME-ASP by [28], and CSHC by, which directly assigns algorithms."}, {"heading": "4 Benchmarking of TTP Algorithms", "text": "An important step in creating algorithm portfolios is to conduct experiments in which the performance of algorithms is determined on the basis of the available problem instances.

We outline the most important of these as follows: 3 \u2022 The instances have 51 to 85,900 cities, based on instances from the TSPlib of [43]; \u2022 For each TSP and KP combination, there are three different types of knapsack problems: uncorrelated, uncorrelated with similar weights, and strongly correlated types, where the last type is difficult for different types of knapsack solvers due to [29, 41]. \u2022 For each TSP and KP combination, there are three different types of knapsack problems: uncorrelated, uncorrelated with similar weights, and strongly correlated types, with 41 of the last type for different types of knapsack solvers]."}, {"heading": "4.2 Benchmark Results", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is not a purely formal solution, but a purely formal one."}, {"heading": "5 Instance Features for the TTP", "text": "In total, we look at 55 TTP instance characteristics.

Here, we look at the lowest, middle and middle edge costs, as well as the ratio of the edges to the distances where the distance is smaller than the mean distance, the proportion of distances where the distance is smaller. In this sense, the difference between the distances is greater than the mean distance, the proportion of different distances (i.e., the standard deviation of the distance), and we look at the mode frequency, quantity and mean.

First, we examined the performance of 21 existing TTP algorithms using the full original set of 9720 TTP instances created by Polyakovskiy et al. [41], and defined 55 instance characteristics for TTP. Then, we examined various approaches to the resulting algorithm selection problem, showing very significant improvements over the individual best algorithms and closing the gap between these and an omniscient oracle by 90%. Finally, we examined which algorithms contribute most to the portfolio and found that the algorithms with the best average performance (e.g. the complex C3-C6 and MATLS and the black intelligence approaches starting with M) were quite important for the portfolio due to their performance on small and medium-sized TTP instances. Interestingly, the relatively simple heuristic S5 will continue to utilize the overall TTP performance of all the other benchmarks, so we can perform well on the large instances of this TTP and thus the most important TTP algorithms of all."}], "references": [{"title": "Chained Lin-Kernighan for large traveling salesman problems", "author": ["D Applegate", "WJ Cook", "A Rohe"], "venue": "Journal on Computing", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Or-library: Distributing test problems by electronic mail", "author": ["EJ Beasley"], "venue": "Journal of the Operational Research Society", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1990}, {"title": "Ant colony optimization techniques for the vehicle routing problem.
