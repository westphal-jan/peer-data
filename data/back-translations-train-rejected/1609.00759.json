MiniSAT (ID) takes as input the grounded ECNF constraints, while CPLEX takes as input the MIP translations (in the form of MPS files) explained by the transformation of ECNF in the previous section. If there are six problems, we also check the performance difference between our automatic translations and a direct MIP model."}, {"heading": "4.1 The benchmark set", "text": "Our yardstick consists of a mixture of artificial intelligence and operations research problems. Table 1 provides an overview. Problems classified as search problems are considered optimization problems with constant objective function - any workable solution is an optimal solution. Search problems are considered for two reasons: First, because we study the feasibility of a MIP backend for the IDP system, we are also interested in the performance of a MIP solution for non-optimization problems. Second, the practical difference between solving a search or optimization problem is often only a relatively simple optimization constraint compared to other, more critical problem features. Note the two different specifications of the NQueens problem: one is based on a Boolean variable for each field on the chessboard and the other on a CP basis with a variable for each row on the chessboard."}, {"heading": "4.2 Evaluating the MIP backend", "text": "This year, it is so far that it will only take a few days to achieve an outcome in which everyone else will participate."}, {"heading": "4.3 Comparison with direct MIP models", "text": "To take this into account and measure the scope for improvement in our MIP translation, we compared the results of the transformed MIP model with reasonably optimized direct MIP models. These direct MIP models were either taken from the literature or constructed by hand, with the exact origin shown in the last column of Table 1. To keep the comparison fair, we used only MIP models that were \"simple\" in the sense that no column generation, decomposition approaches, or special cut-generation algorithms were used. Essentially, the model must be solvable with a classic branch-and-solve algorithm."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and future work", "text": "This work confirms that the IDP system is no exception to other systems - a MIP backend allows IDP to solve a variety of additional problems. However, the MIP cannot completely replace the CP backend. Certain deep planning problems are not satisfactorily solved, and the lack of tightness in the translation of reified linear sums with 6 = or = operators raises problems.We also point out that integrity constraints should be dropped for level mapping variables.Finally, we do not agree with the view that the performance of CPLEX is less than competitive for problems relating only to binary variables and constraints [15]. Our experiments show that the performance of CPLEX for Boolean problems such as Maximum Clique, NQueens logic and chromatic numbering will be more than competitiveying.As for future work, it would be interesting to improve the tightness of the linear transformation with operators = 6 or = 6."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "Supported by the Belgian Bureau for Science Policy (BELSPO) at the inter-university attraction COMEX.
