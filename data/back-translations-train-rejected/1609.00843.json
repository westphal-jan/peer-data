Therefore, in order to perform the real-time classification of streaming data, the execution speed of the classifier should be lower than the arrival rate of the streaming data. Therefore, a high-speed classifier is indispensable for real-time streaming data applications. The proposed universal classifier utilizes the high-speed nature inherent in the ELM. The training time and testing time of the proposed universal algorithm for each data set are shown in Table 4.

The possibility of partial correctness in multi-level classification results is measured in the evaluation of other parameters such as accuracy and F1 labelling. Results are tabulated in Table 6.
