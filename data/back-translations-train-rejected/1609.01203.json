State of the art", "text": "The RBM [9] is a graphical probability model (Figure 2 on page 6), which consists of a series of I visible units v = (v1,..., vI), each representing a binary random variable. These visible units usually model the observed data, in which case I am equal to the dimension of the observed vectors. Note that this model can easily be extended to continuous variables [8]. A series of ofJ binary random variables (h = h1, hJ) are referred to as hidden (or latent) units. Hidden variables are not directly observed and model explanatory factors for the visible units distribution. They are connected to visible units by weights Wij, which activate model dependencies between the visible and hidden units."}, {"heading": "3. Projective orchestration", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "4. Live Orchestral Piano (LOP)", "text": "In this section, we introduce the Live Orchestral Piano (LOP) application, which is the first software that provides a way to compose music with a complete classical orchestra in real time, simply by playing on a MIDI piano. The aim of this framework is to rely on the knowledge gained through the model introduced in the previous sections to transfer the projection from a piano melody to the orchestra, and the software is implemented on a client / server paradigm, which makes it possible to separate the orchestral computation from the interface and the sound rendering engine, making it easy to implement multiple interfaces, and it should also be noted that the separation of computation and rendering takes place on different computers, making it possible to separate the orchestral rendering plugins from the interface and the sound rendering engine."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion and future works", "text": "To select the most appropriate model, we proposed an assessment framework called orchestral inference, based on an orchestral inference task. We evaluated the performance of the cRBM and FGcRBM and observed the better performance of the cRBM model. The general goal of building a generative model for time series is one of the most prominent themes for the machine learning field. Orchestral inference sets a slightly more specific framework in which the time series generated are conditioned by another observed time series (the piano score). In addition, the ability to grasp the far-reaching dependencies that structure music appears to be a challenging and rewarding task. The high dimensionality of the data and its scarcity are a major obstacle to learning algorithms (the piano score). A first remark is that a larger database is needed to capture each model sufficiently complex to adequately represent the underlying distribution of a project orchestration."}, {"heading": "6.
