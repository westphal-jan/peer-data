Philippine Context", "text": "However, the system only includes buses, MRI, LRT1 and LRT2 routes; however, Jeepneys, which is the main mode of transport in the Philippines, is not included in the system. Transit.com.ph, a system produced by the Philippine Transit App Challenge 2013, aims to produce a local version of Google Transit by adding more local modes of transport. However, this system currently only operates the transport system of the city of Cebu; the routes of Metro Manila are not yet fully implemented, so it is only possible to return the foot route from the origin to the destination. Sakay.ph, also produced by the Philippine Transit App Challenge 2013, was successful in creating a local version of the Google Transit application. Your system is able to calculate for a number of routes for the given origin and destination, complete with complementary traffic information.You were also able to integrate route suggestions, the Google Transit system, which is not the most important route occurring."}, {"heading": "A. OpenTripPlanner (OTP)", "text": "OpenTripPlanner is an open-source, multi-modal travel planning system jointly developed by a team of passionate developers from around the world, coordinated by OpenPlans and TriMet. It is a joint effort between TriMet, OpenPlans and the developers of Five Points, OneBusAway and Graphserver, and has been identified as the most promising open source multi-modal travel planning software system with an active developer community, as B McHugh reports [20]. The system would be set up using bike and walking data from OSM and GTFS data from relevant transit authorities, both of which are discussed in detail. OpenTripPlanner includes most of the key features desired in a multi-modal public transport travel planner. It is also important to note that it has an active community that continues to add new features and improve the software. What increases the effectiveness and efficiency of the system is its flexibility in being able to provide open data specifications and repositories, such as OSS and GTM."}, {"heading": "B. OpenStreetMap (OSM)", "text": "OpenStreetMap is maintained by the non-profit foundation OpenStreetMap and is an open-access international database of open-source data to which individuals contribute through their local community. The public and organizations such as transportation companies with open-access data add geographical information to the system. Although most contributors are volunteers, there is an increasing number of commercial organizations and government agencies that contribute to the project. These contributors collect information by driving, cycling or walking along roads and paths and record every step with the help of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Data from the system can be easily shared and viewed by requesting a download or viewing a simple web-based application. Anyone interested in providing and using data over any area can do so. If someone finds an error in the data, he or she is free to correct it accordingly. As the system uses crowdsourcing, the ability to gather information from multiple sources, the public is able to contribute to the database, rather than just a large amount of data, is responsible for creating the data."}, {"heading": "C.
