As alternatives to the manual procedures that we propose, we propose two opposing approaches: to establish confidence in the correctness of invariants and to emphasize their suitability for CPS. Firstly, we will apply statistical model checks (SMC), a standard method for analyzing and verifying invariants, and secondly, we will not recognize their suitability for CPS."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Next Steps", "text": "In this short paper, a novel approach to learning CPS invariants was proposed, which trains an ML technique such as SVM for positive and negative traces of sensor data, the latter achieved by applying mutation operators to copies of programs in the cyber part - the part of the CPS that we can most easily control. We presented a preliminary study on SWaT, a raw water treatment plant that suggests the effectiveness of invariant design in this way. Furthermore, we outlined the use of SMC and symbolic execution to build confidence in the accuracy of the learned invariants, and discussed their use in CPS applications such as physical test stations. Much work remains to determine the effectiveness of our approach to CPS. First, we will automate - as far as possible - our experiment on the SWaT simulator to allow classifiers to perform on multiple additional mutants and initial states of CPS that do not exhibit such behavioral differences."}], "references": [{"title": "Distributed detection of single-stage multipoint cyber attacks in a water treatment plant", "author": ["S.
