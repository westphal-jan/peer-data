Recent research2 has achieved similar results, with little improvement compared to Covell et al. \"s results. Based on Ely et al.\" s taxonomy and their studies with clinicians at the interface of Care2-4, the most important types of information needed for treatment and diagnosis are treatment and diagnosis. Treatment questions (drugs and other therapies) account for about 44% of the questions asked, and diagnostic questions represent about 38% of the questions asked. The goal of this research is to provide physicians with a graphical representation of treatment options."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "The methods are divided into two parts: A) Description of the system that generates an interactive representation of the treatments for a treatment chosen by the user; and B) System Assessment."}, {"heading": "A. System Architecture", "text": "The system for automatically generating treatment indicators consists of a pipeline that combines the following informatics tools and methods: 1) a query processing tool using UMLS Metathesaurus7 to extract concepts, 2) Semantic Medline Database8 to extract treatment relationships, 3) a term-frequency-based algorithm to eliminate non-specific treatment names, 4) a ranking of the remaining treatments based on standardized frequencies and 5) a graphical interface to learn interactively about the treatments. Figure 1 shows the system architecture and procedure."}, {"heading": "1. Query Processing", "text": "As shown in Figure 1, the query of a clinical topic (e.g. heart failure) is initially processed with a UIMA-based (Unstructured Information Management Architecture9) concept extraction pipeline, which maps concepts in narrative text on the UMLS metathesaurus. Components in the pipeline are: \u2022 tokenization or division of the query into individual tokens - adapted to the OpenNLP suite10; \u2022 Lexical normalization or conversion of words into a canonical form - the terminology of the Lexical Variant Generation (LVG) from the UMLS metathesaurus is compressed by i) the terms are converted into lowercase letters; ii) the terms in which the normalized word has more than one token are removed; and iii) the terms that have the same basic form - the Lexical Variant Generation (LVG) terminology is removed from the UMLS metathesaurus and the UMLS metathesaurus is composed as the minor terms; and ii) the UMLS metathesaurus is primed as the minor terms in the UMho."}, {"heading": "2. Treatment extraction from Medline abstracts", "text": "Semantic Medline Database (SemMedDB) 8 is a query of semantic predications (subject-predicate object-triple) extracted by SemRep13, a semantic interpreter of biomedical texts. The query we use searches SemMedDB for sentences in which the object of the sentence is related to disorder and the predicate of the sentence \"TREATS\" (e.g. radio frequency ablation treats atrial fibrillation) is. Algorithm 2 of our previous workplace 14 describes in detail how the queries are created to obtain the relevant semantic predications. Additionally, the query is limited to being novel by eliminating predications that have a generic argument determined by hierarchical depth in the metathesaurus [2]. The query then yields a series of treatments for the disorder (example: constipated heart failure) that are mentioned in medline abstracts."}, {"heading": "3. Eliminating non-specific treatment names", "text": "When treatments were extracted from the Semantic Medline Database, many commonly known procedures such as \"Therapeutic Procedure\" and \"Adjustment Action\" had to be removed, and because these procedures were unimportant to a physician, they had to be removed while maintaining the relevant treatments, some of which were removed using a feature included in SemMedDB that circumvents concepts according to their relative granularity in the terminology hierarchy. Furthermore, we calculated the number of abstracts in which the combination of procedures (e.g. \"Adjustment Action\") and disorders (e.g. \"Congestive Heart Failure\") appears in Medline compared to the number of abstracts in which the treatment itself appears in Medline. Treatments in which the former number was relatively small compared to the later number (< 1%) were categorized as broadly named procedures, and therefore these procedures were removed from the dataset."}, {"heading": "4. Normalized-frequency based ranking", "text": "There are several ways in which treatments can be sorted. We have chosen to normalize treatments initially by their presence in Medline abstracts over individual years (1980-1985, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2005, 2006-2010 and 2011-2013) and construct a linear combination of these normalized frequencies with a combination that gives more weight to recent years, while the other gives equal weights to individual years, and also offers the option in the interface (which will be discussed in the next section) for the clinical user to choose his own weights. Normalization over individual year ranges has been evaluated by using the formula below. Emin represents the minimum value over each year range; Emax the maximum value over each year range. If a clinician is interested in treatments that have been widely used in recent years, we evaluate treatments by evaluating weights of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 weights in each year range."}, {"heading": "5. Graphical interface", "text": "In building the user interface, we tried to convey simplicity and provide a reasonable starting point for clinicians to start collecting information for a specific disease treatment. In building the first iteration of the tool, we first identified use cases that a clinician would have when he started collecting treatment information for a specific disease. In the first use case we identified, clinicians are looking for novel disease treatments in scientific journals. In the second use, clinicians are looking for established disease treatments in scientific journals. In the third use case, clinicians are more interested in treatments that are studied over a certain period of time than the others. Finally, in the fourth use case, the clinician compares the number of individual disease treatments with their overlaps to find popular treatment combinations."}, {"heading": "B. System Evaluation", "text": "For the evaluation study, we used a case-study approach by evaluating the output of the summary knowledge system for the treatment of two diseases: atrial fibrillation (a topic that is relatively well understood) and heart failure (a topic that is less covered but is an increasingly complex field with knowledge from the vast literature).For atrial fibrillation, we compared the system rankings with the practice guideline - Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (Compilation of 2006 ACCF / AHA / ESC and 2011 ACCF / AHA / HRS Recommendations).15 For atrial fibrillation, we compared the system rankings with the practice guideline - 2013 ACCF / AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: Executive Summary: A Report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation / American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.16 For both diseases, we report the precision, reset values and the number of treatments for the top score."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Atrial Fibrillation", "text": "After extracting the \"atrial fibrillation\" treatments from SemMedDB, 623 treatments were degraded, generalizing several treatments that would not benefit a clinician. By using aids and a threshold frequency of 1%, we cleaned up the data of these non-specific treatments. In performing the cleansing, 360 of these treatments were removed and 263 treatments remained. In these 263 treatments, we used our two rankings, which were explained in the paragraphs. New methods of treatment Weight method: The five best treatments produced with this method, together with its UMLS concept Unique Identifier, are ablation (C0547070), Electrometer shock (C0013778), Anticoagulation (C0003281), Stroke prevention (C12772828289) and Heart ablation (C0162563). The precision recall curve for this weight method C05470778 and 12728778 are presented in the Treatment Score."}, {"heading": "Congestive Heart Failure", "text": "After extracting \"heart failure\" treatments from SemMedDB, 1,608 treatments were performed, several of which were generalized procedures that would be of no use to a physician. 1,355 were removed and 253 treatments remained when the cleanse was performed, and we used our two methods described in the methods. New Weighing Methods: The five best treatments produced with this method are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (C0003015), Adrenergic beta antagonists (C0001645), Cardiac resynchronization therapy (C1167956), Brain sodium peptides (C0054015) and Digoxin (C0012265).The accuracy recall curve for this method of weighing beta antagonists (C0001645), cardiac resynchronization (C0011656), Cnatrioxin (1200265) and digioxin (1200265)."}, {"heading": "Interface", "text": "To use the tool, a physician would follow the steps outlined below (see Figure 6 for a screenshot): 1. Clinicians search for a disease about which they would like to receive more information, either by entering the disease name or the UMLS concept Unique Identifier. 2. Clinicians select a treatment trend they are interested in (novel, consistent, custom) 3. Clinicians sort treatments (trend matches: least, treatment matches: least to least) 4. Clinicians select treatments they want to see graphically displayed over time based on the number of mentions."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Atrial Fibrillation: The precision and recall curve indicates that precision decreases as the recall increases. A web interface must display a sufficient number of treatments so that both precision and recall are moderately high. However, in the case of the new established treatment method, the f-score of 0.611 is highest with an accuracy of 0.667, and the recall at this precision is 0.611. This intersection is reached for 60 treatments, and the same intersection applies to the established treatment method. In the case of 60 treatments, the f-score is 0.595, which is about as high as the highest f-score, 0.609 for this method. Heart Failure: In the case of the new treatment method, the best intersection for f-score is 0.4915, which occurs for 80 treatments. Although the highest f-score is 0.503 (which occurs for 100 treatments), 80 treatments would be a better intersection number."}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "The analysis was conducted on only two diseases: \"Atrial Fibrillation\" and \"Heart Failure.\" Although this may be enough to generalize the cardiology system, further experiments are needed to generalize it for all diseases. The 1% threshold used as part of the data cleanup is determined arbitrarily by looking at different data sets. Although this value was helpful in removing several generalized procedures, only a few generalized procedures such as \"hospitalization\" and \"secondary prevention\" have not yet been filtered out. In the future, we will include these thresholds and conduct analyses of treatments for different diseases and work out an optimized value for them. Another limitation is that, like any text mining system, SemRep disregards few relationships (leading to lower memory for our system) and incorrectly allocates relationships (leading to lower precision). In a previous study, the average precision of semantics for predicting four diseases was not predicted."}, {"heading": "Conclusion and Future work", "text": "In the case of atrial fibrillation disorder, the maximum f-score for the new treatment method is 0.611, which is the case for 60 treatments. In the case of heart failure disorder, the maximum f-score for the new treatment method is 0.503, which is the case for 100 treatments. By observing the accuracy, recall and f-score of the ranking methods we have proposed, we can conclude that the extraction and ranking scheme we have proposed could be a good solution for presenting the treatment methods. The analysis we have performed concerned only two diseases, \"atrial fibrillation\" and \"heart failure.\" In the future, we will perform similar analyses for a greater number of diseases. By analyzing these results, we aim to find a generalized optimal solution for other disorders. We discussed various limitations that reduce the accuracy of the results produced. In future studies, we will seek solutions to these limitations."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was made possible by the funding of the National Library of Medicine K99 / R00 LM011389."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2014, "abstractText": "Clinicians are expected to have up-to-date and broad knowledge of disease treatment options for a patient.
