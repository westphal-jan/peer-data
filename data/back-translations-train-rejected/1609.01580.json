This initial screen was conducted using a query from the Enterprise Data Warehouse to identify patients with a possible acute heart failure exacerbation. This screen primarily detects patients based on intravenous diuretics (used to draw fluid from patients with constipation) or blood tests indicating heart failure (brain-natural peptide above 100 ng / dl). The results of this EDW query were manually classified by a cardiologist and a nurse, both experts in identifying patients with potential heart failure. Pictured in Table 1 is the classification scheme. Although we have five colors here, we treat Grey, Red and Purple as a \"Other\" class in our algorithm. Our goal here is to automatically classify different patients into these three classes of patients by automatically calling the Enterprise Data Warehouse MEW Medicine from the Northwestern MEW Medicine."}, {"heading": "Color Description", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "System Overview", "text": "To separate the system into simpler parts, we split our classification system into four components - a rules-based classifier and a machine learning-based classifier. For the two classifiers, all we needed to do was change the implementation of the second and third components in their pipelines. That is, for the rules-based approach, we first extracted data elements and assigned patients to colors according to specific rules. For the machine learning approach, we created functions for all patients \"notes to create a feature matrix and then trained several models on this feature matrix. The entire workflow can be described as follows: 1. The Profile Builder analyzes the raw data to the patient profile, which is an aggregated JSON matrix that contains all of his / her information. With this profile, we will be able to perform analyses against each patient."}, {"heading": "Profile Builder", "text": "NMEDW's raw data are clinical notes created by various physicians, nurses and related health professionals who care for a patient during a particular hospital stay. As we perform the analysis for each patient, we have created a profile for each patient by aggregating all of their information into a JSON file that contains all of the patient's clinical notes."}, {"heading": "Rule Based Approach", "text": "The rules-based approach performs the classification by extracting the correct data elements from patients \"notes and allocating the data elements to specific classes according to specific rules. The intuition of this approach simulates that clinicians make the selection. Data elements. Deciding which data elements to extract requires a lot of domain knowledge. Table 1 shows the data elements we have extracted to feed into the classifier, which are five arolean variables that are fed into the rules-based classifier. These data elements are all compiled by heart failure experts. Note that we first extract the keywords listed in the table and then generate the data elements according to the keywords. For example, when we extract the keywords\" cardiology \"or\" cardiologist, \"we set the variable\" cardiology consulted \"to\" true, \"otherwise\" wrong. \"For the extraction of these keywords, we comply with these regular expressions."}, {"heading": "Machine Learning-Based Approach", "text": "Features. Feature selection8-10 is very important in machine learning. In this approach, we experimented with several features, including n-grams and UMLS concepts derived from cTAKES, 11, etc., for each of the clinical notes in addition to the structured fields for each patient. Before extracting the features, we also performed pre-processing steps, such as removing stopwords, removing short words with less than four characters and replacing all numbers with a placeholder \"NUM.\" Then, we built feature matrix for each patient against these features. Model training. We used 10-fold cross-validation to train and evaluate the classifiers at the patient level. In this approach, we chose four machine learning models, including Na\u00efve Bayes, 12 SVM with RBF kernel, SVM with linear kernel, 13 and logistic regression, 14 to test their performance kit and then choose the first source of the problem by fixing the classifier."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Rule-based classification: Table 2 shows the classification result for rule-based classifiers. We have run our algorithm against all 3834 patients and achieved an accuracy of 69.4%. \u2212 However, we believe that the rule-based classifier will improve significantly with more domain knowledge.Here [1] we first calculate for each class the number of patients with True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN) and then calculate the metrics as follows:"}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We can make several important observations from the classification of rule-based approach and machine learning-based approach. For the rule-based approach, the accuracy of the green class (the patient has active heart failure, but no cardiology service is consulted) is low, since many gray records (the patient does not have heart failure) are wrongly classified as green. This is intentional in designing the algorithm, because it is clinically more important to capture all cases of heart failure, even at the expense of misclassifying cases without heart failure as active heart failure. Accuracy can be improved by further work in identifying words in the documentation that represent heart failure, as well as extracting concepts that highlight the severity of the condition. In addition, the prediction is likely to be significantly improved with the improvement and better use of NLP algorithms for context recognition, so that we are better able to ascertain timing hypotheses for heart failure or general-purpose clinical solution18."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Based on our findings, we conclude that the machine learning approach performs better than the rules-based approach with an accuracy of 87.5% compared to 69.4%. However, our implementation of the rules-based approach is not complete. We believe that it could be improved by classification rules learned from machine learning algorithms. Combined, both algorithms will not only improve outcomes to ensure that the system will be useful for hospital-wide monitoring of active heart failure, but will also make the classifications interpretable."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We recognize support from the National Library of Medicine, et al.
