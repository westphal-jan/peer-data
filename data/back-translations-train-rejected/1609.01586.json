Furthermore, clinicians typically rely on patterns they have learned from patients in their own environment, thereby missing the benefit of screening patients or diagnosing them based on latent knowledge and patterns across an entire healthcare system. However, an automated process for predicting and early diagnosis would be faster and would serve as an independent judge. Rare or orphan diseases defined in the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 as diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States (equivalent to about 6.5 patients per 10,000 inhabitants 3) represent a specific case for this. There are about 8,000 rare diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis, and they often appear to be chronic or debilitating early in life."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Table 4 shows the optimal configuration for each classification algorithm measured using the average ten-fold cross-validation value F1. However, since the number of positive instances in the dataset is very small, the number of closest neighbours (KNN) assumes the lowest possible value 1 (K in KNN). However, KNN and NB give a very low F1 value compared to other complex algorithms because they respond to outliers and do not perform adequate feature selection. These algorithms attach the same importance to all characteristics, resulting in poor performance. On the other hand, SVM, DT and assembly methods give a high F1 score due to the complexity of the models and the ability to perform feature selection intrinsically. Furthermore, the assembly method AdaBoost is expected to outperform the rest of the algorithms by combining the results of other weak learners to arrive at the final hypothesis."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This work is very relevant to an emerging direction in clinical informatics research, focusing on the development of patient similarity measures derived from EHR data for use in a variety of areas. For example, Zhang et al uses patient similarity and drug similarity for personalized medicine. 35 Wang et al tries to provide treatment recommendations and Sanders et al uses similarity to visualize patients are similar.27.28 Li et al uses topological similarity measures to identify subgroups of type 2 diabetes patients.31 Huang et al applied such metrics to analyze clinical pathways and Lee et al applied to predict mortality for individual patients."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We have developed a machine learning system to automatically identify cardiac amyloidosis patients using EHR data. We performed data processing, parameter estimation, feature selection and model selection to achieve a very high cross-validation F1 value of 0.98 with Random Forest, an ensembles machine learning classifier. We also reported on some of the most predictive features. However, our system needs to be validated for its operational value across the healthcare system by running on system-wide EHR data to identify rare disease patients and manually verify accuracy."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "Reference 1.
