Objective: The objective of this paper to present Clinical Recommendation Type System (CRTS), a common type system that can effectively represent a clinical recommendation in a structured form. Methods: CRTS is built by analyzing 125 recommendations and 195 research articles corresponding to 6 different diseases available from UpToDate, a publicly available clinical knowledge system, and from the National Guideline Clearinghouse, a public resource for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Results: We show that CRTS not only covers the recommendations but also is flexible to be extended to represent information from primary literature. We also describe how our developed type system can be applied for clinical decision support, medical knowledge summarization, and citation retrieval. Conclusion: We showed that our proposed type system is precise and comprehensive in representing a large sample of recommendations available for various disorders. CRTS can now be used to build interoperable information extraction systems that automatically extract clinical recommendations and related data elements from clinical evidence resources, guidelines, systematic reviews and primary publications.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 15:02:03 GMT  (2648kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01592v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["ravi p garg", "kalpana raja", "siddhartha r jonnalagadda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01592"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.01592.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Ravi P Garg", "Kalpana Raja", "Siddhartha R Jonnalagadda"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": ""}, {"heading": "Original Paper", "text": "Ravi P Garg, MSc1, Kalpana Raja, PhD1, Siddhartha R Jonnalagadda, PhD1 * 1Division of Health and Biomedical Informatics, Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL CRTS: A type system for representing clinical recommendations Abstract Background: Clinical guidelines and recommendations are the driving wheels of the evidence-based medicine (EBM) paradigm, but these are available primarily as unstructured text and are generally highly heterogeneous in nature.

It has become impossible for clinicians to keep track of every study published in their field. It is also known that medical errors that could have been prevented are the main cause of US patient deaths [2], and this situation is accompanied by a continuous increase in healthcare costs and disease complexity [3]. The recent advances and successes of information extraction systems such as Watson [4] and large amounts of publicly available data, information and knowledge offer a huge opportunity to mitigate these errors and control healthcare costs through new computerised approaches to integrate clinical decision support (CDS) [5] and evidence-based medicine (EBM) [6]. CDS systems aim to assist physicians and healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making [7-10]. EBM refuses to apply medicines based on the best available literature from the major healthcare problems associated with the integration of M and EB3 [11]."}, {"heading": "Clinical Knowledge Systems and Clinical Practice Guidelines", "text": "In fact, the number of patients who are eligible for the treatment of heart attacks, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, strokes, stro"}, {"heading": "Type Systems for Information Extraction Algorithms", "text": "In fact, it is such that most people are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want.

RG and KR authors separated the analysis and the discrepancies were assessed by consulting SRJ. Furthermore, all data elements are summarized in an exhaustive list."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Proposed type system", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before we reach an agreement."}, {"heading": "Population", "text": "In clinical terms, the population is defined as a group of people who have the same characteristics and problems. [39] This definition does not provide details of different data elements used to define a population group. To reduce any ambiguity, we need to concretely define in CRTS the different data elements we use to represent a population group. These data elements are divided into four subtypes: demography, problem, intervention and laboratory results. First, all patients in the population group must share the same demographic. Theoretical demographic data commonly used in clinical recommendations include age, gender, ethnicity and country. In CRTS, we include these data elements as characteristics in the clinical subtype referred to as demographics. Second, a population group is characterized by the medical condition (s) or disorder (s). The recommendation requires that the patient group either have a particular disorder or that it exists in the past."}, {"heading": "Suggestion", "text": "Suggestion is the second main component of the recommendation. Suggestion is the advice given by summarizing the evidence published in medical publications and articles for a particular group of patients. Examples of suggestion (italics) can be found in Tables 1 and 2. Analyzing a large number of recommendations, we find that suggestion is an intervention with optional comparison. We use the same type of intervention that we used to define the population type, including all its characteristics and characteristics. In addition, several interventions can be proposed for specific conditions in some recommendations. We collect this information in the form of specifically designed CNF (AND / conjunction of ORs / Disjunctions) and DNF (OR / disjunction of Ands / Conjunctions) XML expressions. We embed the comparative information in expression types alongside AND and OR expressions."}, {"heading": "Outcome", "text": "The result, the expected result of following the proposal for the population, is the third main component of the recommendation. The result can be quite general, such as \"reducing shocks\" or \"preventing further blood loss,\" or it can be specific to the laboratory results: \"maintaining digoxin 15 values between 0.5 and 0.8 ng / ml.\" In our current type system, we have two clinical subtypes that represent outcomes: General Output and Lab Values. General Output has the characteristics Id and OutputText. Id is the concept identification given to the block, while OutputText is the text margin that denotes the output set. Subtype Lab Values is the same subtype as previously described for the population."}, {"heading": "Recommendation representation example", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "Key Aspects of CRTS", "text": "A. Strong: Existing representation techniques such as ontologies or type systems used by information gathering systems such as MetaMap do not define overarching concepts such as population, suggestion, and outcomes, and therefore fail to communicate the meaning behind clinical recommendations. However, our XML-based type system provides a highly compact, structured form for recommendations and clearly defines the important types, subtypes, and features to symbolize clinical recommendations. As a result, CRTS is better suited to represent clinicians \"information needs and the data elements that need to be extracted from automated systems. B. Comprehensive and definable: As mentioned in Section 2.1, list-based representations such as PICO, PICODR, PIBOSO, Cochrane Handbook, STARD, and CONSORT are ambiguous definitions of concepts based on concepts and images, as well as the ability to cover all aspects of clinical recommendations."}, {"heading": "Applications", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Knowledge Summarization", "text": "Due to the exponential growth in clinical trials and the number of electronically available publications, it is difficult for clinicians to keep pace with the latest medical updates and automated approaches to summarizing knowledge. However, due to the heterogeneity, complexity and abundance of concepts in medical publications and articles, existing automated summary techniques do not produce good results when applied directly to the compilation of summaries. Existing approaches that summarize the biomedical literature use vector similarity [63], conceptual agreement [64], but very limited association extraction [65]. Accuracy or generalizability of the systems is severely limited, and these problems can be solved by a structured intermediate representation that can effectively symbolize citation. As has been demonstrated in other areas, structured representation plays a very important role in abstractive text creation [66-68]."}, {"heading": "Citation retrieval", "text": "Our proposed type system can also be extended and used for indexing quotes. It has already been shown that searching for quotes with the PICO framework works better than traditional methods of gathering information based on unstructured text [69-71]. CRTS-based indexes would be more powerful than PICO-based indexes or other list formats because they provide a more compact structured form for each of the data elements, and the indexed data could then be queried using XML path [72] or other techniques."}, {"heading": "Limitations and Future Work", "text": "Although CRTS has several benefits already discussed in this section, we have identified four limitations: First, the data elements with which we designed the type system have been compiled by analyzing recommendations for RF and AFib and subsequently validated for six other disease states. Nevertheless, the generalizability and comprehensibility of the data elements covered in the current version need to be validated for several other disorders. We expect this to happen prospectively, and since our representation is based on the type system format, it is easy to add new data elements in the form of features or subtypes. Second, the primary goal of 24 CRTS is to create a unified framework that represents extracted data elements from different sources and can be used as the backbone for various applications based on biomedical information extraction. Although we have demonstrated the usefulness of CRTS with such applications from some examples, the implementation and usability of CRTS is not yet evaluated."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced CRTS, a common type system for presenting clinical recommendations. We have shown that our proposed type system is accurate and comprehensive, mapping a wide range of recommendations for various diseases and conditions. We also list the data elements that need to be extracted from the unstructured and heterogeneous text of recommendations in order to create a type-based summary. We are currently extracting these required data elements manually, but in future work an automated system for extracting them can be built. We have also shown that the type system can also be used to present recommendation information from the scientific literature. The proposed type-based structured summary can be used in a variety of medical applications such as CDSS, Knowledge Summary and Citation Repetition. 25"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was made possible by funding from the National Library of Medicine: R00LM011389."}, {"heading": "Abbreviations", "text": "AFib: Atrial Fibrillation CDS: Clinical Decision Support CRTS: Clinical Recommendation System EBM: Evidence-Based Medicine HF: Heart Failure ICD: Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator NLP: Natural Language Processing 26"}, {"heading": "Multimedia Appendix 1", "text": "Further examples of recommendations in CRTS27 28 30 references 1.
