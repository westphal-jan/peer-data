However, a major obstacle is the vast amount of patient data available as unstructured free-form text in electronic health records. Here we propose an information extraction-based approach that first automatically converts unstructured text into a structured form. The structured data are then compared against a list of eligibility criteria using a rule-based system to determine which patients qualify for enrollment in a heart failure clinical trial. We show that we can achieve highly accurate results, with recall and precision values of 0.95 and 0.86, respectively. Our system allowed us to significantly reduce the time needed for prescreening patients from a few weeks to a few minutes. Our open-source information extraction modules are available for researchers and could be tested and validated in other cardiovascular trials. An approach such as the one we demonstrate here may decrease costs and expedite clinical trials, and could enhance the reproducibility of trials across institutions and populations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 15:05:25 GMT  (370kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01594v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["abhishek kalyan adupa", "ravi prakash garg", "jessica corona-cox", "sanjiv j shah", "siddhartha r jonnalagadda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01594"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.01594.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "AN INFORMATION EXTRACTION APPROACH TO PRESCREEN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS FOR CLINICAL TRIALS", "authors": ["ABHISHEK KALYAN ADUPA", "RAVI PRAKASH GARG", "JESSICA CORONA-COX", "SANJIV J.

Introduction", "text": "The creation and acceptance of eHealth records (EHRs) has aroused widespread interest in the use of clinical data for secondary purposes and research [1]. Such an application, which can greatly benefit from an EHR-based approach, is clinical trial screening and recruitment. Clinical trial screening is a process that helps physicians and researchers determine whether a particular patient is suitable for a study based on certain eligibility criteria. Eligibility criteria are usually divided into two parts: inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria are characteristics that prospective subjects must be included in the study, while exclusion criteria are those that prevent potential subjects from being included in the study."}, {"heading": "2.

Methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Patient Records and Eligibility Criteria \u2013 Data Description", "text": "The patient records used in this study are from the EPIC EHR, which is used by Northwestern Memorial Group. The initial group of patients we considered for our experiments was very broad to ensure that we did not miss any patients who could be included - patients whose RF is currently covered by ICD-9 CM diagnostic code 428.0 or who had an echocardiogram last year. We selected 198 of these patients for development and 3002 patients for validation. Each patient's data consists of five types of reports: occurrences, problem list, echocardiography reports, laboratory reports and current drug list. Meetings contain two types of files: names of diagnosis and notes on the progress of the encounter. The characteristics of the patient records for both records are summarized in Table 1. We have 40 eligibility criteria - 7 for enrollment and 33 for exclusion - for the PARAGON clinical study."}, {"heading": "3.2 Algorithm", "text": "The information from the patient data is extracted as part of separate modules designed to extract the data elements relevant to PARAGON, but reusable for other clinical trials. After extraction, we categorize the modules as: (1) structured data norms, (2) unstructured data norms, (3) unstructured data norms used to extract data elements that already exist in structured form. This module is divided into two submodules. We extract the values for age, hematology and blood pressure."}, {"heading": "4. Evaluation and Results", "text": "We compared our methods iteratively with the development of 198 patient reports. A study coordinator read each patient file, extracted elements of data from relevance to PARAGON and compared them with the eligibility criteria. For the 198 patient shares, it took two weeks (80 hours) until we had 40 patients (20%) who had advanced for further analysis according to the eligibility criteria."}, {"heading": "5. Discussion", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "Through our results and discussions, we have shown that any automated recruitment system is sufficient to significantly reduce the workload of patient recruitment, even if it cannot completely replace manual intervention. Our system hypothesizes that performance can be significantly improved by converting unstructured free clinical text into a structured form. To confirm our hypothesis, we have built modules that extract key data from the unstructured text based on pre-defined eligibility criteria. We evaluated our system using two sets of data: one of 198 patients and one of 3002 patients. Our experiments show extremely favorable results and confirm our hypothesis. For future research, we aim to evaluate the reproducibility of our system for PARAGON studies at other institutions. We also intend to build further modules to use the framework for other clinical trials."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was made possible by funding from the National Library of Medicine: R00LM011389 and R01LM011416 and Novartis.

adapt existing rule-based systems to make sure the data elements are not in their negated form using a rule-based negation detection algorithm, the data elements refer to the current status (as opposed to historical condition or a hypothesis for conducting a test) and the data elements correspond to the patient (as opposed to a family member or relative) [41, 42].", "startOffset": 360,

able to automate the data extraction and decision-making tasks that are typically relegated to clinical research study coordinators. However, a major obstacle is the vast amount of patient data available as unstructured free-form text in electronic health records. Here we propose an information extraction-based approach that first automatically converts unstructured text into a structured form. The structured data are then compared against a list of eligibility criteria using a rule-based system to determine which patients qualify for enrollment in a heart failure clinical trial. We show that we can achieve highly accurate results, with recall and precision values of 0.95 and 0.86, respectively. Our system allowed us to significantly reduce the time needed for prescreening patients from a few weeks to a few minutes. Our open-source information extraction modules are available for researchers and could be tested and validated in other cardiovascular trials. An approach such as the one we demonstrate here may decrease costs and expedite clinical trials, and could enhance the reproducibility of trials across institutions and populations.", "creator": "Word"}}}
