Searching the MEDLINE database directly or with query expansion methods returns a large number of citations that are not relevant to the query. The current study presents a citation retrieval system that retrieves citations for evidence-based clinical knowledge summarization. This approach combines query expansion, concept-based screening algorithm, and concept-based vector similarity. We also propose an information extraction framework for automated concept (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Disease) extraction. We evaluated our proposed system on all topics (as queries) available from UpToDate for two diseases, heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The system achieved an overall F-score of 41.2% on HF topics and 42.4% on AFib topics on a gold standard of citations available in UpToDate. This is significantly high when compared to a query-expansion based baseline (F-score of 1.3% on HF and 2.2% on AFib) and a system that uses query expansion with disease hyponyms and journal names, concept-based screening, and term-based vector similarity system (F-score of 37.5% on HF and 39.5% on AFib). Evaluating the system with top K relevant citations, where K is the number of citations in the gold standard achieved a much higher overall F-score of 69.9% on HF topics and 75.1% on AFib topics. In addition, the system retrieved up to 18 new relevant citations per topic when tested on ten HF and six AFib clinical topics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 15:10:39 GMT  (1666kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01597v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["kalpana raja", "rew j sauer", "ravi p garg", "melanie r klerer", "siddhartha r jonnalagadda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01597"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.01597.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Hybrid Citation Retrieval Algorithm for Evidence-based Clinical Knowledge Summarization: Combining Concept Extraction, Vector Similarity and Query Expansion for High Precision", "authors": ["Kalpana Raja", "Andrew J Sauer", "Ravi P Garg", "Melanie R Klerer", "Siddhartha R Jonnalagadda"], "emails": ["sid@northwestern.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, we are able to go in search of a solution that is tailored to the needs of the patients.

Identifying relevant citations with a corresponding clinical trial is a major challenge without a well-focused query.

The PICO framework is expanded to PICOTT (patient / population - intervention - comparison - result - type of question asked - type of study design), 11 PECODR (patient / population / problem - exposure / intervention - comparison - result) 24 and PIBOSO (population - intervention - background - result - study design - others). 25 NLM provides a web-based application for PICO with spelling checks to structure the clinical query. 26 Schardt et.11 used the NLICM comparison to improve the clinical approach."}, {"heading": "Vector Space Model", "text": "The Vector Space Model (VSM) is a mathematical model commonly used by information retrieval (IR) systems.13 Measuring relevance with VSM is effective in the context of IR systems.28,29 The degree of similarity between the input query q and the retrieved quote ci (represents a given quote in a set of retrieved quotations) is calculated using a similarity metric such as Cosine (CC).The cosinal similarity metric is calculated as the ratio of the point product of two vectors q and ci to their magnitude.30. \""}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "System Framework", "text": "In fact, most of them are unable to play by the rules they have set themselves."}, {"heading": "Preprocessing", "text": "The use of abbreviations is common in MEDLINE quotations and is usually defined when used for the first time.
