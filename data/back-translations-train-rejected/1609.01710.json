Such data collection, when performed manually, requires enormous effort and is very time consuming. Although many studies have confirmed the possibility of automating this task using video cameras, we found that few have shown good performance in very tight situations or from a scene with a viewing angle. This paper focuses on tracking pedestrians under heavy shutter from an angle range. Our automated tracking system consists of two modules that work one after the other: the first module recognizes moving objects as spots. The second module is a tracking system. We use probability distribution from the detection of each pedestrian and use Bayesian updates to track the next position.The result of such tracking is a database of pedestrian paths over time and with certain numbers of previous people we have demonstrated that the system can track a large number of people under certain conditions."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "Pedestrian Detection", "text": "The first module recognizes moving objects as blobs. For this module, we have two options: 1. Without prior information: This option generates a generic background image and then subtracts it from the video data to obtain the foreground scene. 2. With previous information: Since we are pedestrians wearing a red hat, we recognize the red hat only by color. We assume that the background model follows the Gaussian distribution, so we calculate the mean and deviation of the image sequence by means of recursive time sequence.

These binary blobs are used as masks for the color image to obtain the color blobs, and the following properties are calculated for each frame. In each column of the calculation, we look at three consecutive frames (i.e. frame t-2, t-1, and current frame t), all of which properties of the blobs are stored in a multidimensional attribute representing two consecutive frames each. We become a frame t-2 in the matrix-2 and t-1 in the matrix-1, or frame t-1 in the matrix-1 in the matrix-1 and t-1 in the matrix-1."}, {"heading": "Results & Analysis", "text": "The result of our detection system without prior information is relatively good for detecting pedestrians in less crowded situations as shown in Figure 3, with only 80% accuracy. The top left image is the original image of the video scene. The crowded scenes, as shown in Figure 3, show the captured pedestrians. The bottom left image shows the tracking results in the image coordinates. In crowded scenes, the tracking without prior information produces a low level of accuracy below 40%. The crowded scene, as shown in Figure 3, was captured during a pedestrian experiment at Ateneo de Manila University, Philippines, for the examination of microscopic pedestrians. The video was shot from the third floor of a building (about 10 meters high) at an unknown angle. The camera was not calibrated.We use prior information to detect the blobs, our algorithm was able to track the lane with much higher results and in some ways more than 90% of the algorithm was able to find the pedestrians after 10 frames were lost."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We have tried to solve this problem by using uncalibrated video cameras from above. We compare two detection options: one without prior information and the other with prior information about the scene. We then use the same tracking algorithm to track them. It has been shown that previous information significantly increases the accuracy of detection. We have also introduced a new algorithm to calculate the probability of the tracking system using the Bayean update in a probability tree. It has been shown that the tracking system can detect more than 90% of the pedestrian even in crowded situations and even when they zigzag. Improving such a system for both part detection and tracking, in order to have a faster and more reliable system, would be the subject of further research."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This project is supported by the Pedestrian Research Group of the University of Ateneo De Manila."}], "references": [{"title": "Tracking Groups of People, Computer Vision and Image Understanding", "author": ["S.J.
