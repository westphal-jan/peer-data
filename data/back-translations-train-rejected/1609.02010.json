The sets of L formulas, L sentences and atomic L sentences are defined in the usual way. If D is a non-empty group, we denounce from At (D, P) the sets of ground atomic M models < D > by a set of L sentences and atomic L sentences defined in the usual way. A classical Herbrand L structure can be considered a tuple. < D, I > where I am an L interpretation of D.A here and there is L structure, is a subset of M (D, P)."}, {"heading": "4 Equilibrium Alpha Graphs", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one is able to find a solution that is able to find a solution that adapts to the needs of the people."}, {"heading": "5 Equilibrium Beta Graphs", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to assert themselves, that they will be able to assert themselves, that they will be able to assert themselves, and that they will be able to assert themselves."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "By introducing a minimal deviation from Peirce's existential graph (the introduction of rectangles), we have presented a diagrammatic representation of the Quantified Equilibrium Logic and the ASP programs. In fact, the current formulation allows the representation of any intermediate logic since it has only just made it possible to define implications, disjunctions, and universal quantification as primitive constructions, rather than derived operators in terms of conjunction, negation, and existential quantifications.This note is a preliminary proposal, but evidently much remains to be done. First, it is still unclear how to provide a fully visual semantic characterization, especially for beta diagrams. Another desirable feature would be a set of consequences and equivalence diagrams that circumscribe rules covering QHT in a solid and complete way.From the ASP perspective, it is interesting to note that QAPEL does not have a direct ASP formula to begin with: ASP is not a form equivalent to ASP."}], "references": [{"title": "Conceptual graphs for a data base interface", "author": ["J.F.
