Crowds of people can be used for post-processing ASR transcripts (McGraw et al. 2010; Wald 2011). The writing system proposed in (Lasecki et al. 2012) allows laymen to add captions to speech in near real time (less than 5 seconds latency). The study reported in (Gaur 2015) analyzes the latency of transcriptions obtained from errors in an ASR output from crowds. In the above studies, a worker must be familiar with the spoken language. This may limit the crowd base for underfunded languages due to the significant discrepancy between the population of native speakers in the world and the crowd workers who speak that language (Pavlick et al. 2014). Therefore, in (Jyothi and Hasegawa-Johnson 2015; Radadia et al 2016) the language is not familiar with that language (Pavlick et al. 2014)."}, {"heading": "Corpus Creation", "text": "The mentioned words are chosen in such a way that the total bodies are phonetically rich for each language. In addition, the length of the selected words is on 4-8 arpabets.S Since the expressions in nature depend on the speakers, it may be that they depend on the speakers."}, {"heading": "Experimental Results", "text": "Crowd Bias against Rejection: We observed that crowd distribution is distorted on the quadrant, where the accuracy when the real world is listed is greater than 50%, while the accuracy when the word is not listed is less than 50%. This shows that the majority of people cannot exercise the reject option when similar sounding options are present in the list. Therefore, in the rest of the paper, we focus on the cases where the correct word is always present in the list shown to the worker. Table 1 shows that task difficulties are increasing (i.e., the options are phonetically similar), performance is being demoted. We highlight that even an accuracy of 45%, as observed for the most difficult options, is significantly better than the random accuracy of 20% (or 25%). Meanwhile, for Indo-European languages the average accuracy, especially for the relatively simple tasks (0124)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "However, in cases where the true value is part of the option list, it has been observed that a disparate group can identify the right option even for fine-grained (phonetically approximate) decisions. There is early evidence that some language pairs (or demographics), even though they are not native, can match better, and there is evidence that voting errors are not correlated, as demonstrated by gains in accuracy from even majority decision-based strategies."}], "references": [{"title": "Acquiring speech transcriptions using mismatched crowdsourcing", "author": ["Jyothi", "P.
