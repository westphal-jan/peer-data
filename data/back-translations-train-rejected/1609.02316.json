THE COMPETITION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. The game", "text": "The world is a labyrinth with peach-colored walls that are not passable. In the middle is a haunted house where the ghosts begin and reappear even after consumption. Pills are placed in the corridors so that Mrs. Pac-Man can collect them, as well as larger power pills that allow Mrs. Pac-Man to consume the ghosts and collect extra points. A view of the game is shown in Figure 1. The different characters in the game are shown in Figure 2. Eating a pill brings Mrs. Pac-Man 10 points and eating ghosts gives her 200 points for the first ghost, but doubles each time to up to 1600 points for the fourth ghost. Maximum points for a maze where n is the number of pills in the labyrinth are 10n + 4 x 200 (+ 400 + 800 + 1600)."}, {"heading": "B. Partial Observability", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of us are in a position to put ourselves in another world, in which they put themselves in another world, in which they find themselves in another world, in which they find themselves in another world, in which they do not find themselves again, in which they do not find themselves again, in which they do not find themselves again, in which they do not find themselves again, in which they find themselves again, in which they do not find themselves, in which they live themselves, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "C. Messaging", "text": "Communication is the cornerstone of teamwork and crucial to the creation of cooperative agents. In competition, communication is strongly controlled by the game to force agents to share information rather than trying to control each other's actions. The communication component consists of two main parts - the messenger and the message. Messages that are allowed will be listed in Table II. Messages that are allowed will have a major impact on the ability and even potentially the design of the controllers. In early versions of the messaging system, there were more messages planned so controllers could ask other controllers where they were and where they were going. Logically, it was clear that most controllers would ask for this information and get every answer (as soon as enough time passed). It therefore made sense to simply remove the messages and allow controllers to pass on the information spontaneously."}, {"heading": "D. Sample Controllers for Ms. Pac-Man vs Ghosts", "text": "In fact, most people are able to move to another world in which they are in the position in which they find themselves."}, {"heading": "E. Sample Controllers Results", "text": "These basic controllers may not be the best agents for the game, but they offer simple comparisons between them as they are based on the same strategy; the only difference between them is the addition of PO and the effects of it are obvious. If you run these controllers over 1000 runs in each combination, you deliver the ones in Table IV. It is clear that PO represents a major handicap for the agent for the same strategies. Unlike COG, the addition of PO to Ms. Pac-Man resulted in the score falling to only 45% of the previous performance. Adding communication skills to the PO ghosts, Ms. Pac-Man could only achieve 33.43% of her previous score. This is a huge difference between two very simple algorithms and clearly shows the benefits of communicating in this scenario.7"}, {"heading": "F. Competition Tracks", "text": "The competition was originally held with two main tracks: the first track allowed participants to submit a code to control the Pac-Man character; the second track allowed participants to submit a single class to control the spirits; the revived competition will also include two tracks: the first track will allow entrants to submit a code to control Ms. Pac-Man, but they will operate within the constraints of the PO; and the second track will allow entrants to submit four controllers - one for each ghost - operating under the constraints of the PO."}, {"heading": "G. Entrant Ranking", "text": "If this process takes too long, participants will be evaluated using the Glicko2 rating algorithm [9], as recommended for similar contests [23], which are used to calculate games in competition at regular intervals, updating the results, and the final results will be calculated using a full round robin of the top ten ghost and Pac-Man controllers before they are announced at the IEEE Computational Intelligence and Games Conference (CIG)."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we presented a major update of the Ms. PacMan Vs Ghost Team contest, which will take place at CIG. We introduced the PO restriction that has been added to the environment, and investigated the impact that the ability to communicate has on the performance of ghosts when incomplete information is available. Finally, we introduced the two tracks: PO Ghosts and PO Ms. Pac-Man. The controllers used in this essay were of a very basic nature, and there is much more potential that can be realized. This contest aims to explore PO in real-time gaming and communication within PO constraints. There is still much to be done in the future. The current contest has only 4 labyrinths for participants to play on. Additional labyrinths can be created and included. The contest has maintained the original balance of a Ms. Pac-Man and 4 ghosts. The competition could be widened to allow for changes to that balance, or more of both."}, {"heading": "V.
