However, learning the meaning of natural language commands is a challenging task (Dukes 2014; Perera and Allen 2013; Chen and Mooney 2011), especially if the robot has little or no prior knowledge of natural language expressions. Due to the high flexibility of natural language, it is not trivial for a robot to capture all phrases in natural language when its interpretation module is first built. Popular crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk offer a fast and inexpensive way to collect interactive data from participants in a variety of different communities. Therefore, simulation of the human machine's interaction process to gather information on crowdsourcing platforms has attracted a lot of research interest (Nguyen, Wallace and Lease 2015; Hladka \u0301, Hana and Luksova \u2012 2014; Goldberg, Wang and Kraska 2013) to further educate the robots on the diversity that we can train."}, {"heading": "Phrase-based Machine Translation Model", "text": "To address the problem of translating natural language commands into a language that can be understood by robots, we first define a robot language that consists of predefined keywords in the robotic task areas. For example, in the task domain of navigation, we define the following keywords. \u2022 Action: = Navigate \u2022 Object: = Traffic Barrels | Buildings | Auto \u2022 Relation: = left | right | rear Each robot language command can be deterministically constructed using a combination of keywords in the task areas. See Figure 1 for an illustration. We then adapt a phrase-based machine translation model to translate robotic commands from the natural language into the robot language. For the phrase-based machine translation model, the key component is the extracted phrase table that stores multiple lexical entries."}, {"heading": "Experiment", "text": "We will present the process of collecting experimental data on Amazon Mechanical Turk, a popular crowdsourcing platform, and extract parallel lexical entries using Moses (Koehn et al. 2007), a machine translation tool."}, {"heading": "Stimulation and Data Collection", "text": "By showing an image depicting the behavior of a robot, a Turk is first asked to give a command in English (referred to as s) that clearly indicates the spatial information between objects in the robot's vicinity. Next, the Turk is shown some robot concepts in several drop-down lists and is asked to select the right robot concepts that can be used to construct a robot command (referred to as r) for the same image. Finally, we simulate the scenario in which the robot can actively ask for a turnover (referred to as t) of the robot command r to better understand it. In total, we collect 88 tuples of (s, t, r) for the navigation task and 120 tuples of (s, t, r) for the manipulation task."}, {"heading": "Phrasal Lexicon Extraction and Translation", "text": "If we compare the second column with the third column in Table 1, we find that more lexical entries are extracted from parallel sentences between t and r than from those between s and r. This convinces us that bouncers usually paraphrase natural language commands that are more semantically associated with robot language commands after they are shown the robotic concepts. Table 2 shows some lexical entries extracted from natural language commands, paired with robot language commands r. We find that the extracted lexical entries capture the similarity between source language commands and target language commands, thus generating many epic entries from natural commands."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we simulate human robot communication on Amazon Mechanical Turk and collect robot commands for navigation and manipulation tasks using crowdsourcing. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of bridging the gap between natural voice commands and robot voice commands using paraphrasing. We will conduct our future work in several challenging aspects: First, lexical entries from different but similar robot tasks can be shared across tasks. Second, machine learning can be integrated by paraphrasing with active learning techniques. Robots can think about the confusing phrases and actively ask their human partners to paraphrase them."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was carried out in part through joint participation in the Robotics Consortium sponsored by the US Army Research Laboratory under the Collaborative Technology Alliance Program (Cooperation Agreement W911NF-10-2-0016) and in part by the ONR under the MURI grant \"Reasoning in Reduced Information Spaces\" (No. N0001409-1-1052).The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted to represent, either explicitly or implicitly, the official guidelines of the US Government's Army Research Laboratory."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning to interpret natural language navigation instructions from observations", "author": ["Chen", "D.L.
