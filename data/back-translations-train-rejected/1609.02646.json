In contrast to other graph prob- lems such as community discovery, which finds groups of highly connected nodes, the role discovery problem finds groups of nodes that share similar graph topological structure. However, existing work so far has two severe limitations that prevent its use in some domains. Firstly, it is completely unsupervised which is undesirable for a number of reasons. Secondly, most work is limited to a single relational graph. We address both these lim- itations in an intuitive and easy to implement alternating least squares framework. Our framework allows convex constraints to be placed on the role discovery problem which can provide useful supervision. In par- ticular we explore supervision to enforce i) sparsity, ii) diversity and iii) alternativeness. We then show how to lift this work for multi-relational graphs. A natural representation of a multi-relational graph is an order 3 tensor (rather than a matrix) and that a Tucker decomposition allows us to find complex interactions between collections of entities (E-groups) and the roles they play for a combination of relations (R-groups). Existing Tucker decomposition methods in tensor toolboxes are not suited for our purpose, so we create our own algorithm that we demonstrate is pragmatically useful.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 03:13:55 GMT  (1195kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02646v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sean gilpin", "chia-tung kuo", "tina eliassi-rad", "ian davidson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.02646"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.02646.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Some Advances in Role Discovery in Graphs", "authors": ["Sean Gilpin", "Chia-Tung Kuo", "Tina Eliassi-Rad"], "emails": ["sagilpin@ucdavis.edu", "tomkuo@ucdavis.edu", "eliassi@cs.rutgers.edu", "davidson@cs.ucdavis.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to move into another world, in which they are able to integrate themselves, and in which they are able to move into another world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they are able to integrate themselves, in which they are able to integrate themselves, in which they are able to integrate themselves, in which they are able to integrate themselves, and in which they are able to integrate themselves, and in"}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The basis for role discovery in graphs using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was first proposed in a series of papers at the KDD [22].

The RolX method [21] used NMF to simplify the characteristics into a set of roles and researched their use for graph conformity, generation of sense and transfer of learning processes. Many previous papers had applied NMF to other data mining problems (e.g. [40] [28]), but theirs was the first to apply it to role discovery.

Our algorithm for solving the problem of guided role finding is a well-researched approach that is used to find the decomposition shown in Equation 2. Like many unrestricted NMF solvers, it uses the alternative approach of the smallest squares [35, 7]. Non-negative minimum squares is a well-researched approach that can be used to find a solution for a matrix (G or F), while holding the other constant that is commonly known as the least square alternative (ALS).

In a general context, thrift has been shown to have two main advantages: (1) thrift and (2) improved predictive power, the latter motivated by Occam's inputs: \u2022 V: node attribute matrix, which contains n nodes described by f topological structural characteristics. \u2022 G: assignment matrix, which meets all constraints. \u2022 F: role definition matrix, which satisfies all constraints of G or F. \u2022 R: number of roles (learning methods r, which have been described in previous work [21]). Outputs: \u2022 G: role assignment matrix, which meets all constraints. \u2022 F: role definition matrix, which satisfies all constraints of F. \u2022 Algorithm: sparse learning formulas exist for many learning situations such as linear regression (LASSO), kernel assignment methods (SVM), and coance matrix are limited to F."}, {"heading": "4.2 Diversity", "text": "In the NMF forms of role finding, nothing prevents the roles to which nodes are assigned (i.e. the G matrix) and the role definitions (i.e. the F matrix) from overlapping greatly, which can be particularly undesirable for the F matrix, since it means that all roles are highly similar. This can be overcome by enforcing a diversity requirement, so that each role uses a different set of characteristics (for the F matrix) and nodes are assigned different role combinations (for the G matrix). Our formulation for role allocation diversity (G matrix) and role definition diversions (F matrix) uses orthogonality as follows: argmin G, F | V \u2212 GF | 2 are subject to the principle: G \u2265 0, F \u2265 0 \u0445 i, j GT \u2022 iG \u2264 G \u2022 j G \u2022 j \u2264 G = j \u0445 i, j \u00b7 j \u2264, FTj \u2022 where a combination of F and F can be assigned as a top limit."}, {"heading": "4.3 Alternative Role Discovery", "text": "In this literature, the most interesting problems can be found in large data sets that contain complex phenomena, and there may be several explanations for the data. However, most unattended learning algorithms expect that there is only one good explanation for the data and return an explanation. In many situations, it may be the case that the returned explanation is undesirable because it is either unusable or not new. Consider the IMDB (Internet Movies Database) dataset. If the resulting roles assign actors to the studios for which they work, then this is not particularly new. Here, work to discover alternative roles allows a previously discovered set of role assignments (G) or role assignments (G). If the resulting roles assign actors to the studios for which they work, this is not particularly novel."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments for Guided Role Discovery", "text": "Our experiments show how restraints can be useful in graph role finding. Role finding requires the user to specify the number of roles to use and a set of characteristics for a graph. In the first case, we used the Minimum Description Length (MDL) described in [21] to automatically select the number of roles, and in the second case, we used the approach described in [22]. We show that role finding can be used to improve the results of the identity resolution problem between two graphs, and that it can be further improved by using economy or diversity constraints. By using economy or diversity constraints, we improve role definitions that lead to more significant role assignments and more precise identity resolutions.

A disk of the core (depending on orientation: from left to right, from top to bottom, or from back to front) can represent an E-group, role, or R-group. Different sections of the same orientation can then be used to compare the similarity of E-groups, roles, and R-groups. For example, in Figure 8, if we look at the sections that correspond to different E-groups from a multirelational role recognition result, a direct comparison of the sections results in a very detailed comparison of the E-groups because we compare whether they have, for example, role / R-group combinations in common. However, if we look at aggregations of these sections, we can get a rough comparison, for example, if the E-groups play the same roles or not, or if they participate in the same R-groups."}, {"heading": "8.2 Visualizing Core as an Interaction Graph", "text": "Further visual understanding of the phenomenon in the multirelational graph can be achieved by visualizing the nucleus as a graph. This is achieved by creating a node for each E group, role, and R group. Of course, this will be a heterogeneous graph. An entry in the nucleus could then be represented in this graph as a clique on the triplet (E group, role, R group) it corresponds to. Since each edge corresponds to a Tucker core entry, its edge can be weighted according to that core value entry and interpreted as similarity. However, if we focus on primarily understanding groups of units, we can create a tripartite graph like Figure 9 that removes the edge between role and R group."}, {"heading": "8.3 Analysis of the Interaction Graph", "text": "Given the interaction graph described in the previous subsection, which shows the relationship between E groups, roles, and R groups, we can analyze this graph in any way we like. A popular approach to simplifying graphs is, for example, to embed the graph in a two-dimensional space. Figure 16 shows such an embedding by means of PCA of the graph in \"hyperedge form.\" This is a n \u00b7 m matrix, where each column in the matrix represents a hyperedge and the entry i, j has the value 1 when node i is involved in the hyperedge j. This heterogeneous object embedding can be interpreted in such a way that each cluster represents a collection of E groups, roles, and R groups that interact frequently."}, {"heading": "8.4 Macroscopic Properties Derived from the Interaction Graph", "text": "Given the interpretation of the nucleus as an interaction graph, we can better understand the macroscopic properties of role dynamics by analyzing the properties of the interaction graph. The metrics we are investigating are motivated in Table 5 along with their calculation, which aims to give the user a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics of the graph. The simplicity property indicates how strongly aligned E-groups, roles and R-groups are, while the division property measures how many roles and R-groups are distributed among different groups of units. The variability property captures the extent of the imbalance in the complexity of different nodes in the interaction graph by measuring both the variance of nodes degrees and the entropy of the stationary distribution along a random path along the interaction graph. Another important property we measure is the stability of the results we discover. At this point, we would like to answer the question of how robust patterns can be found within the interaction graphs and how easily change due to these patterns."}, {"heading": "8.5 Complex Analysis Via Role Transfer", "text": "Our work has so far learned both the E groups, role definitions and the R groups from one multirelational graph. However, we can transfer these definitions from another source by fixing them as constants in Tucker decomposition. For example, if we want to transfer a set of existing roles, we can adapt algorithm 1 and not solve them for the F matrix that defines the roles. This allows us to examine many interesting questions, such as how transferable the roles from other graphs are to explain another multirelational graph. We know this particular type of transmission in Figure 18, but other types of transmission are possible. We are now discussing all types, but due to space constraints experiments show only for role transfer. Roll transfer can be used to determine to what extent roles in different multirelational graphs are similar or dissimilar. If there is a particularly interesting set of roles that have been studied in another graph, they can play a new graph to see how to be transferred to this graph."}, {"heading": "9 Empirical Results", "text": "As in our previous work, all the codes and datasets on our website are made publicly available. As we wanted to focus on the analysis of both multi-relational graphs and collections of similar multi-relational graphs for transmission, we focused our empirical analysis on the Coosponsorship Network Data [15, 16] datasets. This dataset consists of congressional data for over 30 years of Congress. Members of Congress have the ability to add their names to a bill to lend support to it (so-called coosponsoring), and it has been argued that this bill is a good measure of congressional interaction because legislators make considerable efforts to persuade other members of Congress of their bills. Using this publicly available information about coosponsorships, each Congress can be split into a multi-relational graph, with approximately 450 different nodes (congressional representatives) collectively forming coosponsores and consortia that generate approximately 10,000 bills per Congress (many amendments)."}, {"heading": "9.1 Studies on a Single Multi-Relational Graph", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do and what they want to do."}, {"heading": "9.2 Studies Across Multiple Multi-Relational Graphs", "text": "There were two experiments we conducted to analyze these multilateral graphs and to gain insights into them. Firstly, in Figure 17 we analyzed how the Republican characteristics of the learned interaction graphs as shown in Figure 18, while the results of our analysis of the learned interaction graphs are shown in Figure 17. Secondly, we determined how well the roles learned from one congress can be transferred to others as shown in Figure 18. Figure 17 shows that the results of our macroeconomic analysis of the learned interaction graphs from the series of 96 and 1 congresses are transferred to others."}, {"heading": "10 Conclusion", "text": "It is about the discovery of nodes that perform similar functions in networks but do not necessarily belong to the same community. Previous work has had two limitations: they are completely unattended and focus on individual relationship variables. We propose a framework that allows convex constraints to be incorporated into NMF to allow for a range of predictive formulations. In particular, we examine three types of guidelines: thrift and diversity can be used to create simpler and more interpretable role definitions and assignments, and they can reduce overuse and achieve better results for authors \"adaptation between the KDD conference and other conferences."}, {"heading": "11 Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors are grateful for the support of this research by ONR grants N00014-09-1-0712, N00014-11-1-0108 and NSF grants NSF IIS-0801528.

In contrast to other graph problems such as community discovery, which finds groups of highly connected nodes, the role discovery problem finds groups of nodes that share similar graph topological structure. However, existing work so far has two severe limitations that prevent its use in some domains. Firstly, it is completely unsupervised which is undesirable for a number of reasons. Secondly, most work is limited to a single relational graph. We address both these limitations in an intuitive and easy to implement alternating least squares framework. Our framework allows convex constraints to be placed on the role discovery problem which can provide useful supervision. In particular we explore supervision to enforce i) sparsity, ii) diversity and iii) alternativeness. We then show how to lift this work for multi-relational graphs. A natural representation of a multi-relational graph is an order 3 tensor (rather than a matrix) and that a Tucker decomposition allows us to find complex interactions between collections of entities (E-groups) and the roles they play for a combination of relations (R-groups). Existing Tucker decomposition methods in tensor toolboxes are not suited for our purpose, so we create our own algorithm that we demonstrate is pragmatically useful.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
