METHODOLOGY", "text": "In order to measure changes in the behavior of items or deviations from their original status, there should be at least one measurement value for the same attributes considered at different times. Data should be divided into multiple segments based on the number of consecutive measurements of the items, so that each data segment contains a single value of these measurements at any given time. Items at each point of time should be clustered using the same cluster algorithm and identical parameters (such as the number of clusters). After clustering, each item will be a member of a single cluster at any given time. For consistent times, items may belong to the same clusters or they may drift from one cluster to another. The first is the quantification of deviations (change in labeling) between any two points of time by using external cluster validity.

In both sets of data, as they approach the end of the game, players tend to contribute less and their expectations of other players \"contributions decrease accordingly.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In the proposed method, each element is clustered individually at each point in time using the same parameters and cluster algorithms. Once the difference between the elements has been clustered, cluster names of the first cluster and other consistent clusters are measured instead of ground truth labels and provided clusters, a method that has been proven to work well for both synthetic and real game data of public goods. Synthetic metrics such as Rand, VI and AUC work very well by reflecting the number of jumps in a quantifiable scaler. Other metrics such as Jaccard and FM were very good at detecting changes, but they tended to exaggerate the amount of changes that took place in clusters. For public goods data sets, it was possible to gradually change from one point in time to another small number of players who had drifted away from their original clusters in both 10 and 27 rounds."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors would like to thank Simon Gaechter and Felix Kolle from the School of Economics at the University of Nottingham for providing us with data from the experiment on public goods and for taking the time to explain it to us."}], "references": [{"title": "Social Preferences, Beliefs, and the Dynamics of Free Riding in Public Goods Experiments", "author": ["U.

important issue in public goods game is whether player\u2019s behaviour changes over time, and if so, how significant it is. In this game players can be classified into different groups according to the level of their participation in the public good. This problem can be considered as a concept drift problem by asking the amount of change that happens to the clusters of players over a sequence of game rounds. In this study we present a method for measuring changes in clusters with the same items over discrete time points using external clustering validation indices and area under the curve. External clustering indices were originally used to measure the difference between suggested clusters in terms of clustering algorithms and ground truth labels for items provided by experts. Instead of different cluster label comparison, we use these indices to compare between clusters of any two consecutive time points or between the first time point and the remaining time points to measure the difference between clusters through time points. In theory, any external clustering indices can be used to measure changes for any traditional (nontemporal) clustering algorithm, due to the fact that any time point alone is not carrying any temporal information. For the public goods game, our results indicate that the players are changing over time but the change is smooth and relatively constant between any two time points.
