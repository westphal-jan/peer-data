This information of network connectivity is not accurately available, at the low voltage level, due to uninformed changes that happen from time to time. In this paper, we propose a novel data--driven approach to identify the underlying network topology including the load phase connectivity from time series of energy measurements. The proposed method involves the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its graph-theoretic interpretation to infer the topology from smart meter energy measurements. The method is demonstrated through simulation on randomly generated networks and also on IEEE recognized Roy Billinton distribution test system.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 07:52:25 GMT  (158kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02678v1", "Submitted to IEEE transaction on smart grid"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to IEEE transaction on smart grid", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.LG", "authors": ["jayadev p satya", "nirav bhatt", "ramkrishna pasumarthy", "aravind rajeswaran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.02678"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.02678.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Identifying Topology of Power Distribution Networks Based on Smart Meter Data", "authors": ["Satya Jayadev", "Aravind Rajeswaran"], "emails": ["ee15d202@smail.iitm.ac.in,", "niravbhatt@iitm.ac.in,", "ramkrishna@ee.iitm.ac.in,", "aravindr@smail.iitm.ac.in,"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has come to the point where there is only one person who is able to take care of another person who is able to take care of another person."}, {"heading": "II.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)", "text": "It is one of the widely used tools of multivariate data analysis with many applications. It was primarily developed as a method for decoding data and dimensionality reduction (24). Recently, PCA was applied to identify a model in the presence of noise [24], [25]. In this paper, we will use the method of identification with PCA from measurements and, we will revisit it. (1) Model identification with PCA: Let zm (j) be defined as a sample of n variables measured in the jth time, as follows: zm (j) = [zm1), z m 2 (j), z m n (j). The measured values are corrupted by random noise, resulting in an error in the samples. The vector of the measured variables can be written as follows: zm (j) = zt (j)."}, {"heading": "B. Graph Theory Overview", "text": "In this section, certain concepts of algebraic graph theory that belong to this work are revised. 1) Graph and sub-graph: A graph G = (NG, NE) contains a series of nodes (NG) and edges (NE) whose connectivity represents a network of physical or abstract elements. A graph should be directed if its edges are directed from one node to another. S is a sub-graph of G with a set of nodes NS-NG and edges ES-EG, so that ES contains all edges with both endpoints in NS. A graph should be connected if there is a path between each pair of its nodes, otherwise the graph will be separated. The connected sub-graphs of a separate graph are referred to as its components. 2) Tree: A tree is a graph without circuits (or loops) and two nodes in a tree can be connected by a unique path."}, {"heading": "C. Types of Distribution Networks", "text": "Based on the topology of the network, the distribution networks are classified as follows: i Radial distribution network: In this configuration, each of the feeders and distributors is fed from a single source. Therefore, this type of network is characterized by the presence of a unique path from the source (substation) to each consumment.ii Main distribution network of the ring: In this configuration, the feeders and distributors can be connected to multiple sources to ensure greater reliability of the power supply. Therefore, multiple sources are available to feed a load, and there may be multiple paths between these sources and loads. However, the circuit breakers are configured during network operation to supply only one source to a load, and an electrically active path between them is unique. Therefore, the active network can still be considered radial."}, {"heading": "III.

Since the paths from the substation to each of the consumers are unique, as described in Section II-C. The diagram of a distribution network is a tree, as shown in Fig. 2.

The main advantage of such assignment is that it also allows us to determine the phase identity of single-phase consumers."}, {"heading": "B. Energy measurements", "text": "Since we assume that smart meters are installed at all nodes in the network, energy measurements in watt hours (Wh) are collected at regular intervals, usually fifteen or thirty minutes, at a central location and stacked into a data matrix, Z: Z = [zij] (n \u00b7 N) (17), where zij, henceforth referred to as zmi (j), the energy measurement corresponds to the ith node in the jth time interval, n the number of nodes in the network and N the number of measurements recorded per node."}, {"heading": "C. Energy Conservation", "text": "In this section, the concept of energy saving is illustrated by an example. Consider a diagram of an electricity grid with eight energy meters (referred to as nodes 1, 2,.., 8) connected by seven power lines (referred to as edges a, b,.., g), as shown in Fig. 3. The incoming energy is recorded at each node by an energy meter. The principle of energy saving implies that the sum of the energies of incoming lines is equal to the sum of the energies of outgoing lines at each node. Take noise-free readings at nodes 1, 2,..., 8 in Fig. 3, by applying the principle of energy saving, for all times j = 1,., N: zt1 (j) (j) = 2 (j) + z t 3 (j)."}, {"heading": "D. Losses and Errors", "text": "In practice, we need to consider various sources of noise in the measurements in order to be able to infer the underlying topology with the help of data. (These sources of noise and their contributions in the measurements are nex.1) Technical losses: The technical losses include the constant losses such as iron losses, dielectric losses and the variable losses such as copper losses. The latter vary with the load in the network and also depend on the length of the measurement lines. These losses are modeled as errors in the measurements, as they affect the energy savings between the node measurements.

Now, the problem is reduced to finding the connectivity of a forest of directed trees, which is similar to the phase identification problem. By deriving the connectivity between all possible successive layers, the entire network topology can be identified. Let the layers be numbered from bottom to top, as in Fig. 4.

Phase Identification", "text": "The network is constructed using random number generators in MATLAB R \u00a9, as follows: 1) The number of consumers connected per phase is randomly (uniformly) selected between 75 and 100. 2) The N measurements for each of the consumer meters are taken from one of the three uniform distributions, with ranges (0 \u2212 100), (0 \u2212 300) and (0 \u2212 500) to take into account for consumers with different ranges of load. 3) Now, the N measurements for each of the three phase meters are determined by summing the measurements of the consumers connected to them, or. 4) The relative distances of consumers from the transformer are randomly assigned, from a series of numbers. The product of these distances is taken with the respective consumer measurements and scaled to the range (5 \u2212 10). Since the technical losses of consumer loads and their distances depend on the transformer, these products are taken as percentages over the consumer measurements to calculate losses."}, {"heading": "B. Topology Identification", "text": "The proposed algorithm for topology identification is tested by simulation of data for bus 2 of the Roy Billinton Distribution Test System [29], which, according to our formulation, has 2004 nodes. The simulation is performed as follows: 1) The N-values for each of the metering devices were selected from a uniform distribution, with mean and maximum values corresponding to the average and peak loads of the consumers, as mentioned in [29]. 2) The relative distances of the consumers from their source transformer and those of the transformers from their source feeder devices were randomly assigned. 3) The transformer and feeder metering values are then determined in each of the N-time intervals by an appropriate summation of the metering values. 4) The noise in the samples due to technical losses, random errors and time synchronization errors are added in a similar way as described in section V-A. The above simulation is repeated 10 times with different number of metering values from N., the success rate and the algorithms are shown in table II."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "The proposed approach uses PCA and its graph theory interpretation to derive the topology from energy measurements; the proposed algorithms have been confirmed by simulation of random networks and also by simulation of the Roy Billinton Distribution Test System. The proposed method accurately derives the underlying topology when sufficient data is available; in addition, the problem can be solved in polynomic time, and therefore the solution can be easily put into practice. 8 In the future, we propose to use this technique to solve the problems of detecting changes in topology, loss estimation and detection of non-technical losses such as power theft. We also propose to expand this approach to include the underlying network of missing data scenarios."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We would like to thank Prof. S.

In this paper, we propose a novel data\u2013 driven approach to identify the underlying network topology including the load phase connectivity from time series of energy measurements. The proposed method involves the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its graph-theoretic interpretation to infer the topology from smart meter energy measurements. The method is demonstrated through simulation on randomly generated networks and also on IEEE recognized Roy Billinton distribution test system.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
