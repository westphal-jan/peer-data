Some Dialectal Arabic varieties, notably Egyptian Arabic, have received some attention lately and have a growing collection of resources that include annotated corpora and morphological analyzers and taggers. Gulf Arabic, however, lags behind in that respect. In this paper, we present the Gumar Corpus, a large-scale corpus of Gulf Arabic consisting of 110 million words from 1,200 forum novels. We annotate the corpus for sub-dialect information at the document level. We also present results of a preliminary study in the morphological annotation of Gulf Arabic which includes developing guidelines for a conventional orthography.

Introduction", "text": "Most Arabic Natural Language Processing Programs (NLP) are designed to serve the modern standard Arabic (MSA), the official written language in the Arab world. Using such tools for understanding and processing dialectical Arabic (DA) is a challenging task due to the phonological and morphological differences between DA and MSA. Furthermore, there is no standard orthography for DA, which only complicates matters. Some DA variants, especially Egyptian Arabic, have recently received some attention and have a growing collection of resources that include commented corpora and morphological analysts and taggers. Gulf Arabic (GA), generally defined as the diversity of Arabic spoken in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), lags behind in this respect."}, {"heading": "2.

Dialectal Orthography", "text": "Due to the lack of standardized spelling rules for DA, the phonological differences to MSA, and the dialectical variations within the dialects themselves, there are many orthographic variations for written DA content. Authors in DA are often incompatible with others and even with themselves, regardless of the context, when it comes to the written form of a dialect, writing with MSA-driven orthography or phonologically driven orthography in Arabic script or even Latin script (Darwish, 2013; AlBadrashiny et al., 2014). These orthographic variations make it difficult for computorial models to correctly identify and substantiate the words of a particular dialect (Habash et al., 2012b), so a conventional form for orthographic notations is important. Habash et al al al al al al al al al al al. (2012b) suggested a conventional orthography for dialectal Arabic COECT (CODA in general) dialectal dialectal (CODA in general) models were developed for the conventional DA in 2016."}, {"heading": "2.3.

Contributions to DA morphology analysis are generally based on either enhanced available MSA tools to cover DA features, as in the work of Abo Bakr et al. (2008) and Sal-loum and Habash (2011), or on direct modeling of DA without relying on existing MSA contributions (Habash and Rambow, 2006). One of the notable recent contributions to Egyptian Arab morphological analysis is CALIMA (Habash et al., 2012a). The CALIMA analyst for EGY and the frequently used SAMA analyzers for MSA (Graff et al., 2009) are central to the functioning of EGY-GASH, MASH and MASH-MASH, MASH et al."}, {"heading": "3.

We follow the work of Habash et al. (2012b) for CODA to overcome these inconsistencies.

We commented on the corpus at the document level of the novels in addition to information about the name and name of the author of the novel. We also conducted a preliminary investigation into the annotation of the GA text. As a first experiment, we commented on about 4K words from four different novels using proposed orthographic and morphological guidelines that followed previous efforts. We compared our gold annotations with the automatic annotations provided by MADAMIRA on both MSA and EGYmodes. Evaluation of accuracy suggests that the use of automatic annotations from MADAMIRA-EGY as a starting point for GA's manual annotation speeds up the process. We plan to comment the corpus semi-automatically and provide a careful manual review part of it (1M words) as annotation."}, {"heading": "8.
