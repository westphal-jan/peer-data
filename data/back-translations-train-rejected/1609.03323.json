State-of-the-art double integration approaches to extract these parameters from inertial sensor data are, however, limited in their clinical applicability due to the underlying assumptions. To overcome this, we present a method to translate the abstract information provided by wearable sensors to context-related expert features based on deep convolutional neural networks. Regarding mobile gait analysis, this enables integration-free and data-driven extraction of a set of 8 spatio-temporal stride parameters. To this end, two modelling approaches are compared: A combined network estimating all parameters of interest and an ensemble approach that spawns less complex networks for each parameter individually. The ensemble approach is outperforming the combined modelling in the current application. On a clinically relevant and publicly available benchmark dataset, we estimate stride length, width and medio-lateral change in foot angle up to ${-0.15\\pm6.09}$ cm, ${-0.09\\pm4.22}$ cm and ${0.13 \\pm 3.78^\\circ}$ respectively. Stride, swing and stance time as well as heel and toe contact times are estimated up to ${\\pm 0.07}$, ${\\pm0.05}$, ${\\pm 0.07}$, ${\\pm0.07}$ and ${\\pm0.12}$ s respectively. This is comparable to and in parts outperforming or defining state-of-the-art. Our results further indicate that the proposed change in methodology could substitute assumption-driven double-integration methods and enable mobile assessment of spatio-temporal stride parameters in clinically critical situations as e.g. in the case of spastic gait impairments.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Sep 2016 09:33:57 GMT  (2035kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03323v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 10:56:32 GMT  (2035kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03323v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 13 Jan 2017 12:30:39 GMT  (2076kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03323v3", "in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (2016)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["julius hannink", "thomas kautz", "cristian f pasluosta", "karl-g\\\"unter ga{\\ss}mann", "jochen klucken", "bjoern m eskofier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.03323"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.03323.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Sensor-based Gait Parameter Extraction with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks", "authors": ["J.

Preprocessing", "text": "Before the inertial sensor data is fed into the Convolutionary Neural Network, we perform a series of pre-processing steps. In our case, the segmentation step mentioned in Figure 1 is already provided by the dataset. Pre-processing therefore includes extracting annotated steps from the continuous recordings, calibrating raw sensor readings to physical units, transforming the coordinate system to align the sensor axes on the left and right feet, normalizing the step width and increasing it to a fixed length of 256 samples per step to ensure a fixed size of input into the network. The system is trained in data segments from heel stroke to heel strike (HS). This choice of step definition is advantageous as it does not start from a zero-speed phase requiring the state of art double integration approaches to reinitialize the integration process."}, {"heading": "C.

Training", "text": "The formation of neural networks is considered an optimization problem in relation to an error function (implicit) depending on the network parameters. This error defines a discrepancy measurement between predicted results and a reference value for the basic truth on the training data sets or subsets thereof. However, weights and distortions at all levels are then changed by means of backpropagation and with the aim of minimizing the error. In practice, however, only random subsets of the training data set (mini-batches) are shown to the optimizer in an iteration of the training loop in order to accelerate the learning phase (stochastic learning) [27]. Due to the different numerical ranges and physical units in the output parameters (see Table I), the network is trained to estimate normalized and dimensionless output variables y. Therefore, each reference yi, ref is scaled to the range [0, 1] using the minimum value we achieve."}, {"heading": "E.

The step-specific sensor data of 99 patients on the dataset are sorted into training and test partitions depending on patient identification to ensure unique splits in the dataset. For each of the two models, we iterate over the entire dataset and estimate the output variables on the test set in each fold. Estimates from the individual folds are then merged to arrive at average statistics for each output variable and model. As evaluation statistics, we use the average accuracy \u00b1 precision corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the signed error distribution. On the basis of this statistic and a Levene test of equal deviations between the respective distributions, the two models are compared to average statistics for each output variable and model to verify whether the precision is significantly different from each other. As the error distributions for the parameters of the training are slightly different from one infraction for each infraction of the infraction of the infraction of the infraction of the infraction of the infraction of the infraction."}, {"heading": "A.

The error is evaluated for Model A and for each of the submodels, of which Model B. In all cases, the fixed number of 4000 iterations is sufficient to achieve a stable error regime on the entire training data set, and therefore we finish the training. Furthermore, the adaptation of the two models to the training data is comparable with the selected error function as E1... 5 \u2248 0.02 in Model B, which corresponds to a total / sum error of E \u2248 0.1 for Model A (Fig. 6)."}, {"heading": "B.

State-of-the-art double integration approaches to extract these parameters from inertial sensor data are, however, limited in their clinical applicability due to the underlying assumptions. To overcome this, we present a method to translate the abstract information provided by wearable sensors to context-related expert features based on deep convolutional neural networks. Regarding mobile gait analysis, this enables integration-free and data-driven extraction of a set of eight spatio-temporal stride parameters. To this end, two modelling approaches are compared: A combined network estimating all parameters of interest and an ensemble approach that spawns less complex networks for each parameter individually. The ensemble approach is outperforming the combined modelling in the current application. On a clinically relevant and publicly available benchmark dataset, we estimate stride length, width and medio-lateral change in foot angle up to \u22120.15 \u00b1 6.09 cm, \u22120.09\u00b14.22 cm and 0.13\u00b13.78\u25e6 respectively. Stride, swing and stance time as well as heel and toe contact times are estimated up to \u00b10.07, \u00b10.05, \u00b10.07, \u00b10.07 and \u00b10.12 s respectively. This is comparable to and in parts outperforming or defining stateof-the-art. Our results further indicate that the proposed change in methodology could substitute assumption-driven doubleintegration methods and enable mobile assessment of spatiotemporal stride parameters in clinically critical situations as e.g. in the case of spastic gait impairments.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
