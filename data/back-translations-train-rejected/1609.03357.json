If we wish to study creativity scientifically, then a tractable and well-articulated model of creativity is required. Such a model would be of great value to researchers investigating the nature of creativity and in particular, those concerned with the evaluation of creative practice. This paper describes a unique approach to developing a suitable model of how creative behaviour emerges that is based on the words people use to describe the concept. Using techniques from the field of statistical natural language processing, we identify a collection of fourteen key components of creativity through an analysis of a corpus of academic papers on the topic. Words are identified which appear significantly often in connection with discussions of the concept. Using a measure of lexical similarity to help cluster these words, a number of distinct themes emerge, which collectively contribute to a comprehensive and multi-perspective model of creativity. The components provide an ontology of creativity: a set of building blocks which can be used to model creative practice in a variety of domains. The components have been employed in two case studies to evaluate the creativity of computational systems and have proven useful in articulating achievements of this work and directions for further research.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Sep 2016 11:58:59 GMT  (152kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03357v1", "Submitted to PLOS ONE; currently under review.

This approach is based on the principle that creativity results from multiple components converging, and then examines what these components are. This approach, combined with the application of tools from computerized PLOS 7 / 31 linguistics and statistical analysis, enables a broader disciplinary range of perspectives on creativity to be captured than has been attempted so far, achieved by breaking the whole into smaller and more comprehensible components identified through a broad cross-disciplinary investigation of creativity research. Tools from natural language processing and statistical analysis are used to identify words that are highly associated with dimensions of creativity as presented in a sample of scientific work on the subject."}, {"heading": "Corpus data", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "Natural language processing", "text": "The corpus data was initially processed using the RASP Natural Language Processing Toolkit (55) to perform lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging. Lemmatization allows us to identify the different variants of a particular word, counting each of these inflationary variants as an instance of the same word, rather than using them as separate and distinct lexical terms. Lemmatization software allows us to do this by mapping such variants to a canonical form. As a further refinement, each word was mapped to ensure that capitalized word forms (e.g. Novel) were not counted separately from their uncapitalized forms. 3Each word was mapped as part of a grammatical form of grammatical grammatization mapped to its grammatical form to ensure that capitalized word forms (e.g. Novel) were not counted separately."}, {"heading": "Identifying components of creativity", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take one year to move on to the next round."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Components of creativity", "text": "From the analytical steps described in the previous section, it was possible to filter out a number of fourteen key components of creativity, which are summarized in Fig. 7 and are presented in more detail below. Collectively, these components contribute to the overall concept and can be regarded as providing an ontology of creativity. However, it is important to note that the fourteen components do not constitute a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for creativity in all its possible manifestations, for two reasons. Firstly, some of the components that we have identified appear to be logically incompatible with others in the set. Consider, for example, the obvious need for autonomous, independent behavior that is identified in independence and freedom, and contrast this with the requirement for social interaction implied by social interaction and communication. Secondly, creativity manifests itself in quite different ways in different areas [12] and components that vary in importance."}, {"heading": "Dealing with Uncertainty:", "text": "Dealing with incomplete, missing, contradictory, contradictory, ambiguous and / or uncertain information.

Such a model would be of great value to researchers investigating the nature of creativity and in particular, those concerned with the evaluation of creative practice. This paper describes a unique approach to developing a suitable model of how creative behaviour emerges that is based on the words people use to describe the concept. Using techniques from the field of statistical natural language processing, we identify a collection of fourteen key components of creativity through an analysis of a corpus of academic papers on the topic. Words are identified which appear significantly often in connection with discussions of the concept. Using a measure of lexical similarity to help cluster these words, a number of distinct themes emerge, which collectively contribute to a comprehensive and multi-perspective model of creativity. The components provide an ontology of creativity: a set of building blocks which can be used to model creative practice in a variety of domains. The components have been employed in two case studies to evaluate the creativity of computational systems and have proven useful in articulating achievements of this work and directions for further research.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
