A common SMT solution to the lack of parallel data is to pivot the translation through a third language (called pivot or bridge language) for which there is abundant parallel corpora with the source and target languages. Literature covers many pivot techniques. One of the best working techniques, phrase pivot (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007), forms an induced new phrase table between source and target. One of the main problems of this technique is that the size of the newly created pivot phrase sequence table is very large. In addition, many of the produced phrase pairs are low quality, affecting the translation options during decoding and overall translation quality. In this essay, we focus on improving the phrase quality."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In fact, the majority of them are in a position to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to"}, {"heading": "3 Phrase Pivoting", "text": "In this section we review the phrase spin strategy in detail as we describe how we have built our base line for Arabic-Hebrew by pivoting in English.

In the phrase spin movement (sometimes called triangulation or phrase table multiplication) we spin a Hebrew-Arabic and an English-Arabic translation model as it is used in the sentence phrase technique. Based on these two models we induce a new Hebrew-Arabic translation model. Since our models are based on a Hebrew-language-based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007) we use the standard set of phrase spin-phrase probability distributions.1 We follow Utiyama and Isahara in calculating the spin-phrases leverages, using Hebrew-based leverages."}, {"heading": "4 Linguistic Comparison", "text": "In this section we present the challenges of pre-processing Arabs, Hebrews and English, and how we address them."}, {"heading": "5 Approach", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are in a position to move into a different world, in which they are able to live than in another world, in which they are able to live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they are able to put themselves, in fact, in fact, are able to put themselves, are able to put themselves, in a different world, in which they are able to"}, {"heading": "5.1 Rule-based Morphology Constraints", "text": "In fact, the two languages are morphologically rich, as explained in Section 4, it is straightforward to produce these mappings for GEN, NUM and DET. Note that we also consider ambiguous cases, e.g. the female gender in Arabic can be used for words with ambiguous gender in Hebrew (47 keywords) and Hebrew (25 keywords) and in many cases a Hebrew keyword can be used for more than one Arabic keyword in Hebrew, e.g. three Arabic noun keywords in Hebrew (47 keywords) and Hebrew (25 keywords)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Induced Morphology Constraints", "text": "In contrast to the rules-based approach, we build a translation model between the morphological characteristics and the morphological target characteristics and use the morphological translation probabilities as a metric to assess a particular phrase pair in the script table. As for the automatically induced constraints, we jointly model the mapping between conjunctions of characteristics bound to aligned words rather than independently mapping each characteristic. Writing good manual rules for such attribute conjunction mappings would be more difficult. Table 3 shows some examples of mapping (GEN), number (NUM), and determinator (DET) in Hebrew to their equivalent in Arabic, and their respective bidirectional valuations. Since in the rules-based approach we apply two values Ws and Wt to protocol linear space (GEN) defined in Equations 3 and 4.

The English-Arabic parallel corpus is approximately (\u2248 1M words) and is available from the sentence-aligned corpus by Tsvetkov and Wintner (2010). For the direct Hebrew-Arabic SMT model, we use a TED parallel corpus of approximately (2M words) (Cettolo et al., 2012).Word alignment is performed with GIZA + + (Och and Ney, 2003). For Arabic language modeling, we use 200M words from the Arabic Gigaword Corpus 2005C 2005C together with the Arabic side 2005C + 2000C +."}, {"heading": "6.2 Baselines", "text": "We compare the performance of adding the characteristics of the connection strength (+ Conn) to the phrase pivot point of the SMT model (Phrase Pivot) and building a direct SMT model using all available parallel He-Ar corpus. Results are presented in Table 4. In accordance with our efforts to date (El Kholy et al., 2013), the performance of the phrase pivot model improves with the characteristics of the connection strength. Although the direct system is better than the phrase pivot point model in general, the combination of both models results in a high performance gain of 1.7 / 4.4 BLEU points in Dev / Test over the best performers of both the direct and phrase pivot points."}, {"heading": "6.3 Rule-based Morphology Constraints", "text": "In this experiment, we show the performance of adding handmade morphological constraints (+ morph rules) to determine the quality of a particular phrase pair in the phrase pivot translation model. The third line in Table 5 shows that while the rules are based on a one-to-one mapping between the various morphological features, translation quality is improved by 0.5 / 0.8 BLEU points in dev / test sets compared to the basic model of phrase pivot. As expected, the system combination of the pivot model with the direct model improves overall performance, but the gain we derive from the morphological constraints only appears in the dev set with 0.8 BLEU points and not much in the test set."}, {"heading": "6.4 Induced Morphology Constraints", "text": "In this experiment, we measured the effect of using induced morphological constraints (+ morph auto) on MT quality. The last line in Table 5 shows that the induced morphological constraints increased the results by 0.5 / 1.5 BLEU points in dev / test sets compared to the pure phrase pivot model and by 0.7 BLEU points in the test set compared to the rule-based morphological constraints. Similar to the rule-based constraints, performance did not improve compared to the direct model in the dev set; but again, the test showed a large improvement of 1.5 / 1.2 BLEU points compared to the pivot point or direct models. Also, the system combination of the pivot model with the direct model improves overall performance. The model with induced morphological characteristics is the best performer with an increase in performance of 1.0 / 0.8 BLEU points in the dev / test sets. This shows that the benefit we derive from the induced morphological constraints in parallel if we do not perform the morphological constraints."}, {"heading": "6.5 Learning Curve", "text": "In this experiment, we are investigating the impact of using less data in generating morphological constraints and overall performance when combining systems. Table 6 shows the results on a learning curve of 100% (2M words), 25% (500K words) and 6.25% (125K words) of the parallel Hebrew-Arabic corpus. As expected, the system combination between the direct translation models and the phrase pivot translation model results in improved translation quality across the learning curve, even if there is a small number of parallel corpus. Despite the poor performance (2.7 BLEU) of the direct system, which builds on 6.25% of the parallel Hebrew-Arabic corpus, the system combination results in a gain of 1.4 BLEU points. An interesting observation from the results is that we always achieve a performance gain from the induced morphological constraints in all settings, which shows that the system combination helps to select more xical translation options while helping others choose the best constraints in a pair of constraints."}, {"heading": "7 Case Study", "text": "In this section, we will look at an example from our Dev group that covers many of the patterns and themes in the evaluation. Table 7 shows a Hebrew source sentence and its Arabic reference, followed by output from the Pivot system, the Direct system, the Phrase Pivot + Conn + Morph Auto system and the Combined system.Two special aspects need to be emphasized: First, the complementary lexical coverage of the Direct and Pivot systems is difficult in many respects (and this is a problem for the majority of sentences in the Dev group); the Hebrew verb in the present time is male and plural; and of course, the subject follows the subject; the Arabic reference verb appears at the beginning of the sentence where it tactically coincides with the subject (during the number)."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "While the induced morphological constraints approach is more powerful, it is based on the fact that there is a parallel corpus between source and target languages. We show positive results with Hebrew-Arabic SMT. We get 1.5 BLEU points above the phrase pivot point baseline and 0.8 BLEU points above the system combination base with a direct model based on predetermined parallel data. In the future, we plan to rearrange experiments as a posttranslation step based on morphosyntactic information between source and target languages to maintain the relationship between the word order and morphosyntactic agreement in the context of the phrase spin."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The work featured in this essay was made possible by a generous Google Research Award.

One common solution is to pivot through a third language for which there exist parallel corpora with the source and target languages. Although pivoting is a robust technique, it introduces some low quality translations especially when a poor morphology language is used as the pivot between rich morphology languages. In this paper, we examine the use of synchronous morphology constraint features to improve the quality of phrase pivot SMT. We compare hand-crafted constraints to those learned from limited parallel data between source and target languages. The learned morphology constraints are based on projected alignments between the source and target phrases in the pivot phrase table. We show positive results on Hebrew-Arabic SMT (pivoting on English).
