In particular, we show how to integrate data streams into multi-context systems (MCSs) and how to model the dynamics of the systems, based on two types of bridge rules. We illustrate how several typical problems arising in the context of stream reasoning can be handled using our framework. Reasoning based on multiple knowledge sources that need to be integrated faces the problem of potential inconsistencies. We discuss various methods for handling inconsistencies, with a special focus on non-existence of equilibria. In particular, we show how methods developed for managed MCSs can be generalized to rMCSs. We also study the issue of nondeterminism in rMCSs. One way of avoiding nondeterminism is by applying an alternative, skeptical semantics. We show how such a semantics, called well-founded semantics, can be defined for rMCSs, and what the effect of using this semantics instead of the original one is. We investigate the complexity of various reasoning problems related to rMCSs.

One could also apply the preference for language to contexts whose semantics can return multiple sets of beliefs for the same knowledge base, and on the other hand, the flow of information between contexts defined by bridge rules can be considered a source of non-determinism. < Since this leads to multiple equilibriums and thus generates exponentially many equilibrium flows, this may be undesirable in practice, which is why it is important under which conditions non-determinism can be circumvented. < The first source of non-determinism depends exclusively on the choice of contexts that occur in the rMCS, i.e. They can be avoided if the determination / design of the rMCS is called into question.

Next, we will give an overview of this language and show how to use LARS within an rMCS.The LARS language is constructed using a series of atoms defined by dismediate joint sets of predicates P and constant C as usual, with P divided into two disjoint subsets, the extensively predicts PE, and the intensive predicates PI.

Reasoning based on multiple knowledge sources that need to be integrated faces the problem of potential inconsistencies. We discuss various methods for handling inconsistencies, with a special focus on non-existence of equilibria. In particular, we show how methods developed for managed MCSs can be generalized to rMCSs. We also study the issue of nondeterminism in rMCSs. One way of avoiding nondeterminism is by applying an alternative, skeptical semantics. We show how such a semantics, called well-founded semantics, can be defined for rMCSs, and what the effect of using this semantics instead of the original one is.
