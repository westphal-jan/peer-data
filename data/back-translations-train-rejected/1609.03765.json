One needs to perform graph aggregation in a wide variety of situations, e.g., when applying a voting rule (graphs as preference orders), when consolidating conflicting views regarding the relationships between arguments in a debate (graphs as abstract argumentation frameworks), or when computing a consensus between several alternative clusterings of a given dataset (graphs as equivalence relations). In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for graph aggregation grounded in social choice theory. Our focus is on understanding which properties shared by the individual input graphs will transfer to the output graph returned by a given aggregation rule. We consider both common properties of graphs, such as transitivity and reflexivity, and arbitrary properties expressible in certain fragments of modal logic. Our results establish several connections between the types of properties preserved under aggregation and the choice-theoretic axioms satisfied by the rules used. The most important of these results is a powerful impossibility theorem that generalises Arrow's seminal result for the aggregation of preference orders to a large collection of different types of graphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Sep 2016 11:08:23 GMT  (58kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03765v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ulle endriss", "umberto grandi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.03765"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.03765.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Umberto Grandi"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This work refines and extends the work presented at COMSOC-2012 [Endriss and Grandi, 2012] and ECAI-2014 [Endriss and Grandi, 2014b].

Although this is a general framework independent of specific application scenarios and specific decisions regarding the aggregation rule used, we briefly discuss several such specific scenarios in Section 2.2 and propose definitions for several specific aggregation rules in Section 2.3. We then approach the analysis of aggregation rules from two different but complementary angles. First, in Section 2.4, we define several axiomatic properties of aggregation rules that a user might require when looking for a \"fair\" or \"well-mannered\" aggregation rule for a particular application. Furthermore, we demonstrate a set of simple results that show how some of these axioms relate to each other and to some of the previously defined aggregation rules.

The latter identifies a number of requirements that cannot be met in the sense that the only rules of aggregation that correspond to them are dictatorships. The former pushes slightly weaker requirements (especially in terms of collective rationality) and allows for a slightly larger - but still clearly unattractive - set of rules of aggregation, namely oligarchies.

Instead, we focus here on basic properties of graphs that can be expressed in the language of modal logic.

This model was introduced in the fundamental work of Dung [1995], which proposes several different semantic justifications for abstract reasoning frameworks, the principles according to which we can accept or reject arguments, for example, if we accept arguments, and if we accept attacks on others, then we should not accept them either. In a multi-agent system, each agent can be associated with a different abstract reasoning framework, which is argued, i.e. each agent can have different views of what constitutes a valid attack. We can then wish these different frameworks to arrive at a suitable representation of the views of the group as a whole."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}], "references": [{"title": "Measures of clustering quality: A working set of axioms for clustering", "author": ["M.

This is a valid approach, and indeed, the result of Doyle and Wellman is the theorem most similar to Arrow\u2019s original result amongst all the impossibility theorems discussed in this paper. Having said this, we believe that there is some added value in showing their result to be an immediate corollary to another theorem (as we have done here) rather than just showing how it follows from the proof of another theorem (as Doyle and Wellman have done), as this makes it considerably easier for others to verify the result and to prove similar new results themselves.

One needs to perform graph aggregation in a wide variety of situations, e.g., when applying a voting rule (graphs as preference orders), when consolidating conflicting views regarding the relationships between arguments in a debate (graphs as abstract argumentation frameworks), or when computing a consensus between several alternative clusterings of a given dataset (graphs as equivalence relations). In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for graph aggregation grounded in social choice theory. Our focus is on understanding which properties shared by the individual input graphs will transfer to the output graph returned by a given aggregation rule. We consider both common properties of graphs, such as transitivity and reflexivity, and arbitrary properties expressible in certain fragments of modal logic. Our results establish several connections between the types of properties preserved under aggregation and the choice-theoretic axioms satisfied by the rules used. The most important of these results is a powerful impossibility theorem that generalises Arrow\u2019s seminal result for the aggregation of preference orders to a large collection of different types of graphs.
