In this paper, we present the application of Benford's law to a new network flow metric \"flow size difference\", which have not been studied by other researchers, to build an unsupervised flow-based intrusion detection system (IDS). The method was inspired by our observation on a large number of TCP flow datasets where normal flows tend to follow Benford's law closely but malicious flows tend to deviate significantly from it. The proposed IDS is unsupervised so no training is needed thus can be easily deployed. It has two simple parameters with a clear semantic meaning, allowing the human operator to set and adapt their values intuitively to adjust the overall performance of the IDS. We tested the proposed IDS on one closed and two public datasets and proved its efficiency in terms of AUC (area under the ROC curve). Being a simple and fast standalone IDS itself, the proposed method can also be easily combined with other network IDSs e.g. added as an additional component into another existing IDS to enhance its performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Sep 2016 10:51:00 GMT  (140kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04214v1", "15 pages, 4 figures, initial draft (to be finalised soon)"], ["v2", "Fri, 20 Jan 2017 18:22:47 GMT  (155kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04214v2", "13 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 4 figures, initial draft (to be finalised soon)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.AI cs.NI", "authors": ["aamo iorliam", "santosh tirunagari", "anthony t s ho", "shujun li", "adrian waller", "norman poh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.04214"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.04214.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Santosh Tirunagari", "Shujun Li", "Adrian Waller", "Norman Poh"], "emails": ["a.iorliam@surrey.ac.uk", "s.tirunagari@surrey.ac.uk", "a.ho@surrey.ac.uk", "adrian.waller@surrey.ac.uk", "n.poh@surrey.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 9.04 214v 1 [cs.C R] 1General Conditions Network Traffic, Statistical Characteristics, Network Security \u043a Associated authors of this paper are Anthony T.S.

[30] The simple form of the law states that the first digits of many real numbers follow the following probability distribution: Pd = log10 (1 + 1d), (1) where d = 0,..., 9 (any value of the first digit) and Pd the probability of d. This simple form can be generalized to bases other than 10 and other significant digits that differ from the first digit [17, 32].Researchers have proposed various explanations for why Benford's law appears in real data sets [33-35] and a general agreement is that Benford's law is applied to numbers with a scale invariant distribution."}, {"heading": "2.2 IDS", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to be able to try to find a solution that we are able to find, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution, that we are able to find a solution. \""}, {"heading": "3.

Then, a number of samples of each selected metric are collected (one per TCP flow) to detect any significant deviation from Benford's law, using a sliding window to cover a sufficient number of TCP flows (i.e. samples of the metric) so that any deviation can be detected with high security and an acceptable time resolution (which will help balance detection accuracy and false positive and false negative rates).The flow window size W will be a system parameter, and it can be adjusted depending on the type of network environment we use."}, {"heading": "4.2 The Metrics", "text": "As mentioned above, the first and most important component of our IDS is at least one metric that can work with Benford's law. As we aim to identify new metrics, we do not consider the time between arrival, which has already been studied by other researchers [53]. Looking at the attributes of a TCP flow listed at the end of Section 3, we identify two candidate metrics that have not been studied for IDS so far: flow size: the flow size distribution has been extensively studied in the network literature and the estimate of flow size distribution has been an active research topic [61, 62]. It is known that the flow size distribution is typically lengthy and its exact shape strongly depends on the underlying protocol and network environment [63]. The flow size distribution has been studied in IDS, but largely for entropy-based approaches where the entropy-based approach of the observed feature 64 is calculated as evidence for IDS [64]."}, {"heading": "4.3 From Flows to Flow Windows", "text": "Since Benford's law is a distribution, we need to collect enough samples of a given measurement variable to construct an observed distribution that can then be compared with the target distribution to detect deviations. Therefore, we need a flow window for all distribution-based IDS, which is a well-known fact. As the Benford's right distribution has only 9 values, it can be expected that the minimum flow window size will not be very large, ensuring that the time resolution of the IDS is not too small. We will report on our experimental results in Section 5 on how to determine the value of W. In addition to the parameter flow window size W, there is another \"window sliding\" S that defines how the flow window slides. In principle, S can range from 1 to W, and taking a smaller value can potentially help refine the time resolution to some degree. In our work, we take B = W as a representative value."}, {"heading": "4.4 Flow Ordering", "text": "For the difference in flow quantity, obviously each sample of the metric and thus its observed distribution changes. For the difference in flow quantity, the sequence does not make a direct difference, but it can influence which currents are contained in each flow window, which influences the observed distribution. It is therefore a legitimate question whether such a sequence makes a difference and, if so, how we should arrange currents. If we look at all the attributes of a TCP flow, we have selected the following four typical order options for consideration: 1. (start time, end time) 2. (end time, start time) 3. (source IP address, destination IP address, start time) 3. If we know the distribution of flow size distribution, it is possible to derive the distribution of flow size difference under the assumption that the flow quantity is an i.e. sequence, which unfortunately is not the case in most cases. 4. (source address, destination address, start time)."}, {"heading": "4.5 Zero Handling", "text": "Since Benford's law does not cover zero, we need to deal properly with such differences in flow size to avoid system crashes and false detections; there are several options we can consider: 1) skipping all zeros; 2) extending Benford's law to zero, i.e. simply adding P (0) = 0 to the target distribution so that we now have 10 digits to consider (but 0 should never occur); the first option is trivial in implementation, but can lose important information about a particular pattern (repeated streams of the same size) around some attacks; and the second option appears trivial in implementation, but has a non-trivial question of how to measure the fit quality and deviation from Benford's law, which will be discussed in the next subsection."}, {"heading": "4.6 Measuring Goodness of Fit / Deviation", "text": "In order to classify the quality of fit and deviation from the target distribution described by Benford's law into four categories, we need a correct similarity measurement. One of the most commonly used measurements in applications of Benford's law is divergence [39, 45-48], which can be defined in Benford's case as follows: 3 = 1 (P-d) 2Pd, (2) where Pd is the probability of the first digit d, as defined in Eq. (1) and P-d is the probability actually observed of d = 1 (P-d) 2Pd, (2) where Pd is the probability of the first digit d, as defined in Eq. (1) and P-d is the probability actually observed of d. It is effectively Pearson's test statistics [66] against target distribution."}, {"heading": "5. INITIAL EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this section, we describe some of the initial experiments we conducted to test the two types of new metrics (flow rate and flow rate difference), leading to the conclusion that the flow rate difference is a promising new metric for the IDS."}, {"heading": "5.1 Network Traffic Datasets Used", "text": "The second group are datasets that contain known malicious traffic; the third group are datasets with unmarked mixed traffic with malicious and non-malicious flows; all datasets were pre-processed with tshark to obtain bidirectional TCP flows; and the non-malicious datasets we considered include: 1. LBNL / ICSI dataset [68]: We used the entire dataset (442,623 TCP flows).2. UNB ISCX 2012 Intrusion Detection Dataset Dataset [60, 69]: We used two files with non-malicious traffic on Friday, June 11, 2010 (297,398 TCP flows) and on Wednesday, June 16, 2010 (434,674 TCCP flows).3."}, {"heading": "5.2 Flow Size or Flow Size Difference?", "text": "We use a dataset from each of the three groups to gain insights into their potential. Table 1 summarizes the results showing that the flow size difference seems to follow Benford's law better than the flow size difference, although in both cases the expected sequence of \u03c72 divergence values was observed: non-malignant < mixed < malignant. We repeated this experiment with some other datasets and observed largely the same pattern, so we opted for the flow size difference for other experiments. The potential of using flow size is not entirely excluded, but we will leave it to our future work."}, {"heading": "5.3 How to Determine Flow Window Size?", "text": "As we discussed in the previous section, the size of the flow window W is a parameter of the IDS that can allow some degree of power control. So, although we assumed that W does not have to be too large, we need an indication of how to set it. Therefore, for a selected dataset (LBNL / ICSI dataset), we calculated the average divergence value of \u03c72 of all currents when the size of the flow window W changes from 500 to 20,000 and increases with a step size of 250. Figure 1 shows the results. As you can see, the average divergence value of \u03c72 initially decreases rapidly, but the decreasing rate continues to decrease while W increases. Note that the original divergence value is also very low (below 0.02), so the results suggest that W can probably be set to a value between several hundred or thousand in most cases."}, {"heading": "5.4 Flow Ordering", "text": "Another experiment was conducted to test whether the flow order can change how the flow size difference follows Benford's law. For non-malignant flows in the LBNL / ICSI dataset, the average \u03c72 divergence values for all four order options listed in Section 4.4 are: 0.0094497, 0.0086003, 0.0087495, and 0.0073707, all below 0.01. For malicious flows in the HONEYBOT dataset, the average \u03c72 divergence values are 0.04102922, 0.039240332, 0.039630320, and 0.036690744, all above 0.03. Repeated experiments with other malignant and non-malignant datasets yielded similar results, so that we can see that the flow order does not really change the differential value for flow sizes, suggesting that the flow size difference is a most robust measurement against the flow order."}, {"heading": "5.5 Other Settings", "text": "Our experiments with the two different zero handling options suggested that Benford's law largely worked in both cases. Similarly, for the two different variants of the differential metric of flow size (flow size as number of bytes and packet number), we found that both worked well with Benford's law."}, {"heading": "5.6 More Results on Different Datasets", "text": "The above experiments showed that the difference in flow size is a good measurement that works with Benford's law. To further test its potential, we conducted a large-scale experiment to calculate divergence values of \u03c72 for a large number of TCP flow windows for many datasets in all three groups. We used two representative window sizes (2,000 and 10,000) and a sliding window step 1 to obtain sufficient data to view statistics on the divergence values of \u03c72. Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the results for the three different sets of datasets. Note that the divergence values of \u03c72 of different datasets should be directly compared, as these datasets correspond to completely different network environments and acquisition methods. Despite the diversity of datasets and observable fluctuations of \u04212 divergence values, especially the maximum values, the divergence value of \u03c72 of different datasets indicates a high divergence from < <"}, {"heading": "6. IDS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION", "text": "In this section, we present details of our further experiments to evaluate the performance of a simple IDS based on the determined flow size difference metric. As we mentioned above, the IDS has only one metric and its structure is simple, so our goal is not to make it exceed other IDS, but to provide evidence that even with such a single metric, the IDS performs reasonably, so that it has the potential to be used with other metrics and methods to design IDSs with better overall performance. Indeed, due to many known and complicated issues surrounding the performance evaluation of IDSs [10, 51, 82] it is not trivial to fairly compare the performance of multiple IDSs, even if we wish to. Although we will not report any comparison with other IDSs, we have decided to release our source code so that other researchers can easily verify the results we have reported and integrate our work into their IDSs to perform further performance analysis, so that our source code can be written by ATLAMB / decoded and can be incorporated into the source code from http: / www.IDS.com."}, {"heading": "6.1 Datasets Used", "text": "The two most commonly used datasets in the past are the DARPA datasets [83], which have long been known in the IDS community, and which are very pronounced in the datasets. Their use is generally discouraged, and most researchers assume that the datasets are closed. Both datasets have serious design flaws, which are contained in the datasets. They are very outdated."}, {"heading": "6.2 Dataset Pre-Processing", "text": "All three data sets used have river-level labels, but our IDS works at the river level, so we had to convert the flow labels to flow-level labels. Specifically, if a flow label contains W flows whose labels are {li = 0 or 1} W i = 1 (1 means malicious and 0 means normal), then the designation L of this flow label can be determined as follows: L = character ((W \u2211 i = 1li) \u2212 Tl), (3) residence mark (x) = {1, if x \u2265 0.0, otherwise. Note that the threshold Tl can also be represented as a ratio between 0 and 1: tl = Tl / W."}, {"heading": "6.3 Benchmarking Metric", "text": "Instead of reporting accuracy indicators such as false positive and false negative rates, we chose the area under curve (AUC) of the threshold-based IDS (receiver characteristic curve) as our most important benchmarking metric. This is because our IDS has adjustable parameters, so capturing accuracy indicators alone is not enough. We were aware that the ROC is not the best benchmarking tool for IDS, but found it easier to use for our proposed IDS to demonstrate the usefulness of using flow size differences for IDS purposes. Advanced benchmarking metrics typically introduce new factors (e.g. cost [88]) or additional steps (e.g. adaptive threshold management [89]) that we would like to avoid as they can unnecessarily overcomplicate the performance assessment task. As we expect flow size differences to be used as a metric along with other metrics and methods to help us design more advanced IDS benchmarking for future work."}, {"heading": "6.4 Experimental Results", "text": "We conducted extensive experiments on various parameter settings of the IDS with the KDD Cup 1999 and TRT datasets. For the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, the window sizes we tested are 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2500 and 5000, and for the TRT dataset we tested W = 250 to 5000 with a step size of 250. In general, our results on the KDD Cup 1999 dataset are very good, but those on the TRT dataset are relatively inferior, which may be due to the fact that the normal currents are artificially simulated and attacks were carried out by students learning cyber security (making both less natural).All similarity metrics worked reasonably well, but it seemed that the Euclidean distance performed the best overall malicious datasets and all other settings, and the two different variants of the flow size difference (in bytes and in packets) do not significantly differ the outcomes."}, {"heading": "7. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "This year, it will be ready to leave the country in which it is located."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper examines possible applications of the Benford Law to anomalous-based network IDS and reports on a new working parameter that has not yet been investigated: flow size difference. Unlike flow size, flow size difference has rarely been studied in both IDS and network literature, but our study showed that it is a good metric in the sense of Benford's law: normal, non-malicious TCP flows follow it closely, but malicious flows differ significantly from it. We conducted a large number of experiments with many network traffic datasets to verify the observation, and used it to construct a simple threshold-based IDS. IDS was tested with three labeled datasets (one closed dataset plus two public datasets) and it has been shown that the performance of the IDS is promising, especially given its simple structure. We call for more research on the use of flow size differences in IDS research, especially on how it can be used to supplement other IDS."}, {"heading": "9.

The method was inspired by our observation on a large number of TCP flow datasets where normal flows tend to follow Benford\u2019s law closely but malicious flows tend to deviate significantly from it. The proposed IDS is unsupervised so no training is needed thus can be easily deployed. It has two simple parameters with a clear semantic meaning, allowing the human operator to set and adapt their values intuitively to adjust the overall performance of the IDS. We tested the proposed IDS on one closed and two public datasets and proved its efficiency in terms of AUC (area under the ROC curve). Being a simple and fast standalone IDS itself, the proposed method can also be easily combined with other network IDSs e.g. added as an additional component into another existing IDS to enhance its performance.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
