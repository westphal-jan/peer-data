Conclusion", "text": "In this research note, we have provided evidence that the synthesis problem is EXPTIME-complete with the logical specification represented in LTLf, LTL is interpreted via finite tracks. This result improves the 2EXPTIME-complete result reported in [21]. Our complexity results complete the landscape of complexity results that combine LTLf synthesis and non-deterministic planning. EXPTIME-complete with full observation, LTLf synthesis and non-deterministic planning is EXPTIME-completed. With partial observation, LTLf synthesis and non-deterministic planning, 2EXPTIME-complete is the latter result recently reported in [27]. Our evidence takes advantage of recent advances in the automated planning community, in particular the algorithm used to prove EXPTIME membership in Lemma 1 is inspired by recent compilations of automates."}], "references": [{"title": "Applications of recursive arithmetic to the problem of circuit synthesis", "author": ["A.
