However, existing distance supervision approaches only extract relations expressed in single sentences. In general, cross-sentence relation extraction is under-explored, even in the supervised-learning setting. In this paper, we propose the first approach for applying distant supervision to cross- sentence relation extraction. At the core of our approach is a graph representation that can incorporate both standard dependencies and discourse relations, thus providing a unifying way to model relations within and across sentences. We extract features from multiple paths in this graph, increasing accuracy and robustness when confronted with linguistic variation and analysis error. Experiments on an important extraction task for precision medicine show that our approach can learn an accurate cross-sentence extractor, using only a small existing knowledge base and unlabeled text from biomedical research articles. Compared to the existing distant supervision paradigm, our approach extracted twice as many relations at similar precision, thus demonstrating the prevalence of cross-sentence relations and the promise of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Sep 2016 22:01:26 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04873v1", "8 pages + 2 pages reference"], ["v2", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 04:42:20 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04873v2", "8 pages + 3 pages reference"], ["v3", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 23:54:49 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04873v3", "Presented at EACL 2017; 9 pages (12 pages including references)"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages + 2 pages reference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chris quirk", "hoifung poon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.04873"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.04873.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction beyond the Sentence Boundary", "authors": ["Chris Quirk"], "emails": ["chrisq@microsoft.com", "hoifung@microsoft.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to surpass themselves, both in terms of the way they move, in terms of the way they move, in terms of the way they move, in terms of the way they move, in terms of the way they move, in terms of the way they move."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "For example, Mintz et al. (2009), who coined the term \"remote monitoring,\" the individual characteristics of multiple instances of the same relationship are expressed in three ways (relationship, entity1, entity2), but each instance is a sentence in which the two entities exist side by side. Therefore, their approach cannot single out the relationships between the two entities in which the two entities live in different sentences. Similarly, Zheng et al. (2016) looks at aggregated information from multiple sentence distances, but could not extract the opposing proposition relations. Distanced supervision was also applied to the completion of Wikipedia information boxes (Wu and Weld, 2007) or TAC KBP slot filling3, where the goal is to extract attributes for a given entity that could be regarded as a special kind of relation (attribute, entity, general value, entity scenario) very different from these multiple scenarios."}, {"heading": "3 Distant Supervision for Cross-Sentence Relation Extraction", "text": "In this section, we introduce DISCREX, the abbreviation for DIstant Supervision for Cross-Section Relation EXraction. Similar to traditional approaches, DISCREX learns a classifier to predict the relationship between two entities, since it presupposes spans of text in which the entities coexist. However, unlike most existing methods, DISCREX allows text spans that contain multiple sentences, and potentially examines many paths between these entities."}, {"heading": "3.1 Distant Supervision", "text": "As in previous approaches, DISCREX learns from an existing knowledge base (KB) and unlabeled text. KB contains known instances of the given relationship. In a pre-processing step, relevant units within this text are commented with available entity extraction tools. As positive examples, coexisting entity pairs are selected that are known to have the relationship in KB. Assuming that related entities are relatively rare, we sample randomly occurring entity pairs that are not known to have the relationship as negative examples. To ensure balanced training, we always stitched approximately the same number of negative examples as positive ones."}, {"heading": "3.2 Minimal-Span Candidates", "text": "This is useful if the entity pairs are within individual sentences. However, in the cross sentence scenario, there is a risk that too many false examples will be introduced. Consider the following two sentences: Since amuvatinib inhibits KIT, we validate MET kinase inhibition as the primary cause of cell death. Furthermore, it is known that imatinib inhibits KIT. Mentioning the drug gene pair imatinib and KIT (in bold) comprises two sentences, but the same pair also occurs in the second sentence alone. In general, simultaneous entity pairs could be found in a large text span in which the same pairs also occur in a smaller text span that overlaps with the larger one. In such cases, if there is a relationship between the pair, it is usually in the smaller text span when the entities are closer together. This motivates us to define another pair if we do not exceed a minimum distance between the two sentences."}, {"heading": "3.3 Document Graph", "text": "In order to derive entity pair characteristics both within and across sentences, DISCREX introduces a document graph with nodes representing words and edges representing intra- and inter-sentential relationships such as dependence, adjacence, and discourse relations. Figure 1 shows an exemplary documentary graph comprising two sentences, each node labeled with its lexical item, lemmas, and part of the speech. To mitigate parser errors, we also add edges between adjacent words. With respect to inter-sentential edges, a simple but intuitive approach is to add an edge between the dependency roots of adjacent sentences (de Marneffe et al, 2006): If we imagine that each sentence participated as a node in a kind of discourse dependency tree, this represents a kind of right-branched baseline."}, {"heading": "3.4 Features", "text": "Dependency paths have been established as a particularly effective source of relation extraction traits (Mintz et al., 2009).DISCREX generalizes this idea by defining characteristic patterns via paths in the document diagram that may contain edges of different types (dependence, word and sentence adjacency, discourse relationship).Dependency paths provide interpretable and generalizable characteristics, but are subject to a parser error. An error reduction strategy is to add edges between adjacent words, enabling multiple paths between entities. Character extraction begins with a pair of entities in the document diagram that are potentially related to each other. We begin by finding a path between entities of interest and extracting characteristics from this path.Each such path explores a number of distinct characteristics. Following, we assume that each path is a sequence of edges, 1, 1, and L (nnnnnnn)."}, {"heading": "3.5 Multiple paths", "text": "When authors use consistent lexical and syntactical constructions, and when the parser finds the right parser, this approach works well. However, real data is quite noisy. One way to mitigate errors and be robust against noise is to consider several possible paths. Considering a document diagram with arcs of multiple types, there are often multiple paths between nodes. For example, we examine the number of shortest paths, N, between the nodes in the document diagram that correspond to the relevant units, or just neighborhood arcs, or a combination of both. By default, all edge types have an equal weight of 1, except edges between adjacent words. Empirically, prosecuting adjacent edges has had significant benefits, although this strategy, including multiple adjustment of errors, should provide valuable information for the initial adjustment of paths."}, {"heading": "3.6 Evaluation", "text": "In remote monitoring, there is no gold-annotated dataset, so evaluation typically relies on two strategies: One strategy uses pre-recorded samples from the training dataset and essentially treats the noisy annotation as the gold standard. This has the advantage of being automatic, but could lead to distorted results due to false negatives (i.e., entity pairs that are not known to have a relationship); another strategy reports absolute recall (number of extractions from all unlabeled texts) as well as estimated precision through manual annotations of extraction samples from the general text. We performed both types of evaluation in the experiments."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We look at the task of extracting drug-gene interactions from the biomedical literature. A drug-gene interaction is generally understood as a relationship between the effectiveness of drugs and gene status, which includes mutations and activity measurements (e.g. overexpression). For simplicity, we only look at the relationship at the level of drugs and genes, without distinguishing between details such as drug dose or clear gene status."}, {"heading": "4.1 Knowledge Base", "text": "We used the Gene Drug Knowledge Database (GDKD) (Dienstmann et al., 2015) for remote monitoring. Figure 2 shows a snapshot of the dataset. Each line specifies a gene, some drugs, the fine-grained relationships (e.g. sensitive), the gene status (e.g. mutation) and some accompanying article IDs. In this paper we only look at the coarse drug-gene association and ignore the other areas."}, {"heading": "4.2 Unlabeled Text", "text": "We sourced biomedical literature from PubMed Central7, which in early 2015 contained approximately 960,000 full-text articles; we edited the text using SPLAT (Quirk et al., 2012) to perform tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing; and obtained Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006) using Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014); and we used the entity tag 7http: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / gers from Literome (Poon et al., 2014) to identify drug and generational references."}, {"heading": "4.3 Candidate Selection", "text": "In order to avoid unlikely candidates such as entity pairs that are far apart in the document, we consider entity pairs within K consecutive sentences. K = 1 corresponds to extraction within individual sentences. For extraction from cross sentences, we chose K = 3 because the total number of candidates doubled while being relatively small to avoid introducing too many improbable ones. Table 1 shows the statistics of drug-gene interaction candidates identified in PubMed Central articles. K = 3 has 87,773 cases for which the drug-gene pair has known associations in the Gene Drug Knowledge Database (GDKD), which are used as positive training examples."}, {"heading": "4.4 Classifier", "text": "Our classifiers were binary logistic regression models, trained to optimize the log probability with a regulator \"2. We used a weight of 1 for the regulator; the results were not very sensitive to the specific value. The parameters were optimized with L-BFGS (Nocedal and Wright, 2006). Instead of explicitly mapping each feature to its own dimension, we hacked the attribute names and retained 22 bits (Weinberger et al., 2009). Approximately 4 million possible features seemed sufficient for our problem: fewer bits led to deterioration, but more bits did not lead to improvement."}, {"heading": "4.5 Automatic Evaluation", "text": "In order to study the effects of this development, we must try to find a solution that is capable, that is able to put itself in the position in which it is able to find a solution."}, {"heading": "4.6 PubMed-Scale Extraction", "text": "Our ultimate goal is to extract knowledge from all available texts. First, we retrained DISCREX on all available remote monitoring data and did not restrict ourselves to a subset of wrinkles as in automatic evaluation. We used the systems that performed best in automatic evaluation, with features derived from 30 shortest paths between each entity pair, and candidates with a minimum span within three sentences for cross-sentence extraction. Subsequently, we applied the learned extractors to all PubMed Central articles. We grouped the extracted ingredients into unique drug gene pairs. The classifier gave a probability for each case. The maximum probability of instances in a group was assigned to the relationship as a whole. Table 4 shows the statistics of the extracted relationships by varying the probability threshold. Cross-sentence extraction achieved significantly more unique relationships compared to single-sentence extraction and improved the absolute memory by 102% of the unique number of Gs."}, {"heading": "4.7 Manual Evaluation", "text": "In order to evaluate the actual accuracy of DISCREX, we focused on the latter. We randomly extracted relation cases and asked two researchers with knowledge of precision medicine to assess their accuracy. In each case, the annotators received the provenance rates in which the drug pair was highlighted, and the annotators evaluated in each case whether a relationship was mentioned for the given pairing. In total, 450 cases were evaluated: 150 were randomly assigned by all candidates (random baseline), 150 from a series of instances with a probability of no less than 0.5 and 150 with a probability of no less than 0.9. From each group, we randomly selected 50 relationships for review by both annotators. The two annotators agreed to 133 out of 150 additional discrepancies."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We present the first approach to applying remote monitoring to the extraction of interchangeable sentences by applying a document-level diagram that takes into account both intra-sentential dependencies and inter-sentential relationships such as adjacence and discourse relationships. We performed both automatic and manual evaluations to extract drug-gene interactions from biomedical literature. By extracting opposites, our DISCREX system doubled the yield of unique interactions while maintaining the same accuracy. By remote monitoring, DISCREX improved the reach of the Gene Drug Knowledge Database (GDKD) by two orders of magnitude without requiring commented examples. Future work includes: further exploration of characteristics; improved integration with correlation and discourse sparing; combination of remote monitoring with active learning and crowd sourcing; assessment of the impact of extractions on precision medicine; other applications."}], "references": [{"title": "Precision medicine", "author": ["Orli Bahcall."], "venue": "Nature, 526:335.", "citeRegEx": "Bahcall.,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bahcall.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Open information extraction from the web", "author": ["Michele Banko", "Michael J.

However, existing distance supervision approaches only extract relations expressed in single sentences. In general, cross-sentence relation extraction is under-explored, even in the supervised-learning setting. In this paper, we propose the first approach for applying distant supervision to crosssentence relation extraction. At the core of our approach is a graph representation that can incorporate both standard dependencies and discourse relations, thus providing a unifying way to model relations within and across sentences. We extract features from multiple paths in this graph, increasing accuracy and robustness when confronted with linguistic variation and analysis error. Experiments on an important extraction task for precision medicine show that our approach can learn an accurate cross-sentence extractor, using only a small existing knowledge base and unlabeled text from biomedical research articles. Compared to the existing distant supervision paradigm, our approach extracted twice as many relations at similar precision, thus demonstrating the prevalence of cross-sentence relations and the promise of our approach.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
