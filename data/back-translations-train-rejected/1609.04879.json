As stated in 2011: Final Fantasy XII (Square Enix 2006) NPCs look very realistic, but they react in a similar way to characters in the first final fantasy games in the 1990s, with possibly just one very basic state machine guiding the characters, and this is the same in role-playing games in general: when the player approaches the NPC, the character says something about the red dragons guarding the Great Treasure - and repeats the same thing every time the player comes close."}, {"heading": "AND THUS THE ENGINE: SUMMARY OF ORIGINAL WORK", "text": "In recent years, it has been shown that the problem is a problem that is not a problem, but a problem that is a problem.

Bura et al. gave a presentation at the Game Developer's AI Summit in 2012 that spoke in part about using the underlying facets of the Big Five to give personalities to NPCs. However, Bura's idea is to give + x / -x (between 2 and -2) values to combinations of facets to create needs and behaviors (collectively referred to as traits), similar to how ExAI combinations of facets are used to create the responses / stimulus types. However, a big difference is that characters do not have values for their own facets; instead, the traits are each given (tagged) as a set of values and traits. The \"shyness\" trait can be created through a series of adjustments to different facets."}, {"heading": "PUTTING THE EXTREME IN THE AI: POST-PPE DEVELOPMENTS", "text": "Over the past four years, ExAI has undergone a major evolution, and as was to be expected, many changes have been made to transform ExAI from a master's project into a marketable, robust personality engine. I will discuss the most important changes below. Many, many types of stimulus / response have been added to realistically simulate human personalities, and facet weights have had to be combined into far more than the three types of stimulus / response tested in the work. While these types cover many situations / interactions, 39 types were ultimately defined that seemed most useful (Figure 3)."}, {"heading": "Personality Storage", "text": "Originally, the facets for each of the NPCs were stored in an SQLite database using multiple interconnected tables; while this worked for the original project, two problems confused attempts to apply this method in one game: access speed and lack of support for all platforms. As discussed below, facets are called for each method call in many combinations, and it may be necessary to read and write these facets for many characters at the same time. For example, in the They Vote! demo (see next section), 100 NPCs were queried at once whenever a politician made a speech or acted in a different way that might affect voters. Access to anything the database uses could take more than 3 minutes to complete, and even in SteamSaga, where conversations are generally one-to-one, given the requirements of graphical rendering, physics calculations, audio, etc. a complex facet check could occasionally cause a slight \"hiccup.\""}, {"heading": "Fine-tuned the facet adjustments", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to follow the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

After all, man is not made up solely of personality. Following are some additions / modifications that could be made: adding an emotion layer for strictly transient emotions, similar to Love / Hate (2015), Mac Namee's Mood Machine (2004), Li & MacDonald's Emotion Layer (2008), and others. This could add more depth, even though so far transient emotions can be successfully migrated by the motor as-is (e.g. reversing any facet changes involved in emotion when the stimulus is gone). Indeed, this is progress (Georgeson, upcoming). Currently, the ExAI machine remembers how an actor has the NPC feeling or otherwise affects the personality."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The fully developed ExAI personality system has lived up to expectations that it could produce a human-like personality that changes over the course of a character's existence - helping these NPCs to truly live in their game world rather than being part of the scenery. It worked well in both role-playing and simulation, and would probably work just as well in any game with non-player agents: sports or other management simulations, strategy games such as the Civilization series, etc. Further tests will be conducted on players \"responses to ExAI-driven NPCs. However, ExAI is just a start, as it is part of a series of larger projects to make game characters and other agents as realistic as possible, including memory, morality, natural language, and more."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Thanks to Dr. Christopher Child, who acted as a dissertation consultant for the original PSA thesis and is therefore listed as a co-author of this paper."}], "references": [{"title": "Programming Game AI by Example", "author": ["M.

INTRODUCTION: THEN AND NOW on-player characters include all the inhabitants of the game world who aren\u2019t being played by human beings; they are, in effect, the original virtual actors. Their roles include everything from the bit parts (man in crowd, woman in shop) to main characters (player\u2019s confidante, love interest, main villain), yet they rarely have any autonomy or development and do not react to player actions or world events as real people would. At best, they change as the script dictates. At worst, they merely repeat the same tidbit of information again and again, no matter that the world around them is going down in flames. The original 2011 project (unnamed at the time; referred to in this paper as the prototype personality engine, or PPE) sought to change this, allowing NPCs to be \u201cutilised much more effectively and realistically\u2014made, in fact, more human by giving them personalities that change over time and through interactions with the players, other NPCs, and the game world,\u201d giving them \u201cadded realism [that] would add depth and flavour where before there was only cardboard two-dimensionality\u201d (Georgeson 2011). The objectives of the project included (as stated in the original): \uf0b7 creating support NPCs whose personalities develop realistically over time depending on interactions with a player in a game environment \uf0b7 comparing these NPCs to a set of unchanging NPCs whose reactions are controlled by random chance As the PPE was developed into Extreme AI (ExAI), the system was further refined and developed. Its primary objectives became: \uf0b7 creating more potential interactions for developers to call (originally there were but three\u2014kindness, annoyance, and intimidation\u2014which worked well for the PPE but were far too limiting for realism) \uf0b7 speeding up the system so that complex interactions didn\u2019t noticeably slow down action in a game \uf0b7 moving away from using a database for storage so that weband mobile-based games could utilize the system This paper summarizes the research and original work on the PPE, personality engine development since that time, and the current capabilities of ExAI. PERSONALITY ENGINES AND ACADEME While limited in scope, the PPE was, at the time, the only one of its kind. Given increases in computational power, AI could be (and sometimes is) provided with increased resources, but it is still given short shrift compared to graphics (Doherty & O\u2019Riordan 2006; Lemaitre, Lourdeaux, & Chopinaud Jan 2015). As stated in 2011: For example, Final Fantasy XII (Square Enix 2006) NPCs look very realistic, but they react in ways similar to such characters in the first Final Fantasy games in the 1990s, with possibly only a very basic finite state machine guiding the characters, and this is the same in roleplaying games generally: When the player approaches the NPC for the first time, the character says something about the red dragons guarding the Great Treasure\u2014and repeats the same thing every time the player comes near. After the player has completed this quest and returns to tell the NPC about it, the NPC may (or may not) be complex enough to say something about being happy no longer having to deal with the dragons.
