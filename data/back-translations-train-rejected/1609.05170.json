The conceptual dimension once more prevails after taking back seat to specialised lexicography. This is demonstrated by the emergence of ontology in terminology. While the Terminology Principles as defined in Felber manual and the ISO standards remain at the core of traditional terminology, their computational implementation raises some issues. In this article, while reiterating their importance, we will be re-examining these Principles from a dual perspective: that of logic in the mathematical sense of the term and that of epistemology as in the theory of knowledge. We will thus be clarifying and describing some of them so as to take into account advances in knowledge engineering (ontology) and formal systems (logic). The notion of ontoterminology, terminology whose conceptual system is a formal ontology, results from this approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Sep 2016 18:33:20 GMT  (665kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05170v1", "Proceedings of the 10th Terminology and Knowledge Engineering Conference (TKE 2012), pp.17-32. 19-22 June 2012, Madrid, Spain"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 10th Terminology and Knowledge Engineering Conference (TKE 2012), pp.17-32. 19-22 June 2012, Madrid, Spain", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["christophe roche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05170"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.05170.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Should Terminology Principles be re-examined?", "authors": ["Christophe Roche"], "emails": ["roche@univ-savoie.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: terminology, terminology principles, ISO standards, ISO 704, ISO 1087-1, knowledge theory, ontology, logic, ontoterminology."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them are able to survive themselves if they do not put themselves in a position to survive themselves.

[16] It is necessary to bear in mind some epistemological principles (see the note at the end of this paragraph), one of which is that there are two different kinds of knowledge: \"An object is defined as something that can be perceived or understood.\" [16] It defines the first level (and first type) of knowledge that is designated as individual (object or individual in short) knowledge: \"Such things are called individuals because each thing consists of a collection of characteristics that can never be identical to another; for the characteristics of Socrates could not be the same for any other particular person.\" [21] Individuals must not be confused with the singular concept that is \"said only of one thing.\""}, {"heading": "3 Concept", "text": "The ISO 704 standard distinguishes between two types of concepts: the individual term \"which corresponds to only one object\" [18] and the general term \"which corresponds to two or more objects forming a group by virtue of common characteristics.\" [18] Such a distinction does not make sense and should be avoided. In fact, a concept is a unit of knowledge that encompasses a multitude of things, regardless of the number of objects represented (one, two or more or even zero 3). The definition of a concept does not depend on the cardinality of its extension. Moreover, considering a unique object as an individual concept 4 is not only unnecessary in terminology work, but raises several questions. If \"Canada\" is an individual concept, what is its delimitation from the cardinality of its extension."}, {"heading": "4 Characteristic", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the two are two persons residing in the United States, and two persons residing in the United States."}, {"heading": "5 Relation", "text": "\"Concepts do not exist as isolated units of thought, but always in relation to each other.\" [16] The principles and the ISO norms distinguish two types of relations between concepts: hierarchical relations, which group general and partial relations, and associative relations. The former play a central role in that they order the conceptual system and thus enable us to understand and master its complexity: science is the order of reality. The latter expresses a connection, considered to be non-hierarchical, between concepts \"by virtue of experience\" [18], such as relations concerning a cause and its effect, producer and product, etc."}, {"heading": "5.1 Generic relation", "text": "Two concepts are linked by a generic relationship if the intention of the first, superior concept and, more precisely, the generic concept is incorporated into the intention of the second, subordinate concept, and if the second contains at least one additional separator: \"Relationship between two concepts in which the intention of one concept encompasses that of the other and at least one additional separator.\" [18] This relationship is irreflexive 10, asymmetrical 11 and transitive 12. It therefore defines a strict order - a9 Built with OCW (Ontology Craft Workbench), an environment for the construction of ontology defined by specific differentiation (\u00a9 C.Roche, University of Savoie). 10 Let SCh be the set of characteristics, SCp the set of concepts and > the generic relationship defined () in the Cartesian product SCp \u00d7 SCp."}, {"heading": "5.2 Partitive relation", "text": "It is often easier to describe a thing as it is perceived, as it appears to us in view of its components, than to define it as it is (its nature). Therefore, the partial (part) or merological relationship plays an important role. Principles and ISO standards qualify the partial relationship as hierarchical in order to convey the idea that a thing can become ever more detailed and comprehensive, but the partial relationship does not define itself as order15."}, {"heading": "5.3 Associative relation", "text": "Associative relations are external relations between concepts (external relations in the sense that they are not necessary for understanding the interconnected concepts) not hierarchical (neither generic nor partial) due to \"experience.\" [18] In principle, they do not impose any limitations on the nature of connected concepts. Associative relations are binary relations, which entails the translation of relationships of greater importance into a series of dyadic relations. ISO 1087-1 gives some examples of association relations: sequential, temporal and causal relationships. The absence of defining features in the definition of these relationships is regrettable (Figure 3 is a proposal)."}, {"heading": "5.4 Ontological relations", "text": "The term \"ontology\" does not appear in the standards ISO 704 and 1087-1. The Terminology Handbook [10] refers to ontological relations in order to characterize indirect relations between concepts and, in particular, partial (merological) relations. Therefore, ontology does not mean the same thing in knowledge engineering, which defines it as a formal specification of concepts and their relations17 [13], [14], [35], [37]. Therefore, the most important relationship is that of subsumption (generic relationship), where terminology [10] speaks of a logical relationship (logical subordination). Given that ontology is a topic in itself today and represents one of the most promising possibilities for modelling and coercive representation of the conceptual system of terminology [26], [30] we propose to use the word ontology in the acknowledged scientific-technical sense."}, {"heading": "6 Definition", "text": "According to the principles, definitions are \"representations of a concept\" [18] and \"should reflect the system of concepts.\" [16] Definitions would apparently nei-17 The first and etymological meaning of ontology is \"the science of being independent of its particular determinations.\" This definition is closer to the definition given by knowledge engineering - even if there is some confusion between \"being\" and \"existence\" - than terminology. 18 To be compared with the origin of species by their definition in terms of genre and specific difference (the definition of genre and difference). Other concepts - these are created by a \"unique combination of features\" - are still the system of concepts. Definitions are made retrospectively when unique combinations of characteristics are compiled and relationships are identified. Here we distinguish two types of definitions, more intense and extensive."}, {"heading": "6.1 Intensional definition", "text": "Intensive definition, similar to a definition in terms of genre and difference, encompasses the overarching concept immediately above it, followed by one or more delimiting features. However, since the same concept can be directly subordinated to several concepts that should be choosed20? The fact that different definitions can lead to the same unique combination of features is not a problem in itself. Principles also require a specification of the features that distinguish a concept from its coordinated concepts (or at least should do so in a well thought-out conceptualization system). Definitions based on a partial or associative relationship are not satisfactory from a formal point of view in that the development of the unique combination of features that define the concept is not clearly defined."}, {"heading": "6.2 Extensional definition", "text": "The extended definition of a generic or comprehensive concept consists in the enumeration of all its subordinate concepts (specific in the case of a generic concept, partial to a comprehensive concept).This type of definition must not be confused with the \"extended definition\" of a theorem (or concept) in mathematics, which consists in enumerating the objects that contain this theorem (or belong to the concept).19 For this reason, we will also refer to the \"enumerational definition\" in order to avoid any confusion. While the advantage of this type of definition is understandable, it immediately raises the question of how the unique combination of features that identify the concept should be defined.19 However, it should be specified that any unique combination of features createsa concept, this does not necessarily have a meaning in relation to the field. 20 In other words, leave C1, C2 and C3, SCp with C1 = {a} {2}, Cb {3}, Cb."}, {"heading": "7 Logical relation", "text": "The extended (enumerational) definition of a generic term is reminiscent of the concept disjunction [10] of the terminology manual - defined, in this particular case, on the basis of concept extensions, which raises identical questions in the context of determining the characteristics of the generic term thus created. However, it is the same idea: the possibility of developing new concepts on the basis of existing concepts, be they generic, specific or comprehensive. Concept conjunctions that do not exist in ISO standards are interesting from this point of view. However, the definition of the intention of the resulting specific concept as a combination of intentions entails certain contradictions. How could we interpret a concept deriving from the combination of two coordinative concepts (i.e. from the same generic concept), which would be distinguished by a delimiting property (is it possible to be one thing and its opposite at the same time?)."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion and Perspectives", "text": "The conceptual principles rightly emphasize the importance of field concepts as the basis of terminology, but ultimately a scientific system is also important, since terminology cannot exist without specialized knowledge. However, the creation of the concept system is a challenge, mainly because knowledge, which is often tacitly and rarely described in scientific and technical documents, needs to be explained, which is absolutely essential for expert participation in and contribution to the work on terminology [28]. To help us in this task, the principles propose a certain number of paradigms that demonstrate a scientific ambition for reality - a mathematical structuralism - based on coherent conceptual systems. However, inaccuracies in these paradigms make terminology operationalization difficult and explain the status of knowledge engineering in this area - solely from the computing perspective - the principles need to be re-examined. The definition of the principles should be carried out with the same meticulousness as these systems."}], "references": [{"title": "Interaction between Terminology and Philosophy", "author": ["L.M.

In this article, while reiterating their importance, we will be re-examining these Principles from a dual perspective: that of logic in the mathematical sense of the term and that of epistemology as in the theory of knowledge. We will thus be clarifying and describing some of them so as to take into account advances in knowledge engineering (ontology) and formal systems (logic). The notion of ontoterminology, terminology whose conceptual system is a formal ontology, results from this approach.", "creator": "Word"}}}
