We can construct ASPIC + arguments and attacks (Section 3.1). The Structure Preference Relationship -SP takes into account both the default priority < and the logical structure of the arguments. This is motivated by the fact that PDL adds default values when constructing extensions (Section 3.2). The representation theorem states that under -SP the PDL extension and the conclusion of the stable extension exactly coincide (Section 3.3, Theorem 3.14). We can directly prove that the stable extension of interest fulfills the postulates of the Caminada-Amgoud rationality (Section 3.4, Theorem 3.20). Since this is the only complete extension of our defeat diagrams, our instantiation corresponds to the postulates. Finally, we do not need to prevent the construction of conflicting arguments (Section 4.2)."}, {"heading": "4 On Lifting the Assumption of a Total Order", "text": "Default Priority In Section 3, we have presented an argumentative characterization of the PDL conclusion, where the default priority < is a strict global order. It seems that we have lost generality, but this is not the case, because calculating an extension in PDL always requires a linearisation < + of < (Section 2.3), and Theorem 3.14 shows that for such linearisation the agreement of conclusions between PDL and its argumentation semantics persists, but the reasoning can also define argumentation preferential relationships based on an underlying subdivision. We are now examining how to overturn the assumption that < is for the LPDT T T + as a whole, so that the resulting multiple stable extensions each correspond to an extension of the underlying PDT T T T. Our underlying representation of the PDL in ASPIC + is the same as in Section 3.1, but now < a partial order."}, {"heading": "4.1 The Argument Preference Relation based on Partial Order Default Priorities", "text": "In Section 3.2, we have developed the structure-preference-argument-preference ratio -SP, which takes up the PDL idea of adding the \"< + largest active\" default (Equation 2.5).

Reiter's Default Logic (DL) [19], as a partial special case 35 of Brewka's PDL [7, sentence 6], has been provided by Dung [11, Section 4.1] with a solid and complete argumentation semantics. DL, however, cannot deal with priorities and consequently draws counterintuitive conclusions. We know that conflicts between defaults occur frequently and priorities are an intuitive and overarching method for resolving such conflicts [7, 8]. It is therefore important to examine how preferences can also be included in any argumentation semantics.
