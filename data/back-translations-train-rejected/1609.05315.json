INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE on-player characters are everywhere in most game worlds; they are the shopkeepers, the bureaucrats, the guards, the bartenders... in fact almost all the inhabitants of each city or city. But they are as faceless as they are numerous, and they act in predetermined (and usually simplistic) ways that do not allow them to act autonomously, much less to react to events or change their minds in a realistic way over time. This project focuses on creating NPCs with human-like personalities that use the Extreme AI (ExAI) personality machine, and then tests whether these NPCs can react and change due to external stimuli - in this case (and in this interesting US election year) on politicians who are each trying to win the votes of 100 NPCs."}, {"heading": "II.

In addition, ExAI allows these facets to change over time, based on various models of personality change and elasticity [3], although it is generally much faster than in real life, so a player can see these changes over time."}, {"heading": "III.

The Politicians", "text": "This is a campaign based on personalities and on one of the hottest topics (rabbits running the country): Voters choose a candidate and decide how well a politician is perceived - how popular, trustworthy, efficient and reliable he is. Politicians start with a certain amount of baggage, taking years of politics and public opinion forming for example: \u2022 Brian Jackson (Conservative): Very charismatic, a bit of a fool and often says unpleasant things; also you don't always get something done. \u2022 Len Kingston (Liberal): Not particularly likeable and seen as a bit of a backroom trader, but he is extremely efficient and speaks much better than Jackson.The candidate's baggage can be undone way or they can get the same baggage in the simulation.

For the sake of consistency, these decisions were made regardless of voters \"feelings about rabbits. The next five runs were from Kingston's point of view. We chose the second choice in the first round (not too promising), then choice two (with his own report). Kingston is very positive for the rabbits, first you love them, then you kiss them (to show that they are lovable), and then you rant and talk about building a fence.
