Uncertainty and incompleteness of information are inevitable in real-life reasoning, so sometimes it becomes difficult and misleading, if not impossible, to assign a precise degree of belonging to a fuzzy attribute or to assign a precise level of truth to a proposal. Therefore, assigning an interval of possible truth values is the natural solution. Intervals are suitable for describing the degree of expert belief that may not be precise (Nguyen, Kreinovich, & Zuo, 1997). If an expert chooses a value, say 0.8, as his degree of faith for a proposal, we can in fact only vaguely state that his chosen value is about 0.8 and can be represented by an interval, say [0.75, 0.85]. Otherwise, an interval can be considered a collection of possible truth values that an individual or several rational experts would assign to a proposal."}, {"heading": "2.1 Bilattice-based Triangle:", "text": "Bilattices are ordered propositions in which elements are partially ordered in relation to two orders, one representing the degree of indeterminacy or truth (namely the order of truth) and the other the degree of certainty (namely the order of knowledge) (Arieli et al., 2004; Cornelis et al., 2007).

The structure, the precept-based triangle, together with the logical operators defined on it, provides a framework for thinking with imprecise, uncertain and incomplete information. In contrast to the bilatzik-based triangle, the precept-based triangle is capable of coping with repetitive changes in belief in nonmonotonous thinking. Furthermore, the order of truth in the new structure is more intuitive. The fact that the knowledge and truth order has now become completely orthogonal has a strong appeal in areas of application where nonmonotonous logical thinking with vague and incomplete information comes into play. As demonstrated here, all operators defined for bilatzik-based triangles are also suitable for the proposed structure and the modified truth order, giving rise to some new logical connections with interesting properties.

But the truth and knowledge ordering of intervals in bilattice-based triangle can not handle repetitive belief revisions which is an essential characteristic of nonmonotonic reasoning. Moreover the ordering induced over the intervals by the bilattice-based triangle is not sometimes intuitive. In this work, we construct an alternative algebraic structure, namely preorder-based triangle and we formulate proper logical connectives for this. It is an enhancement of the bilattice-based triangle to handle belief revision in nonmonotonic reasoning.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.996 Copyright 2016 Radical Eye Software"}}}
