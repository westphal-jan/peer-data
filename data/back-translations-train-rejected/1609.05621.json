We try to extend the known decidability results for unification in the Description Logic $\\mathcal{EL}$ to disunification since negative constraints can be used to avoid unwanted unifiers. While decidability of the solvability of general $\\mathcal{EL}$-disunification problems remains an open problem, we obtain NP-completeness results for two interesting special cases: dismatching problems, where one side of each negative constraint must be ground, and local solvability of disunification problems, where we consider only solutions that are constructed from terms occurring in the input problem. More precisely, we first show that dismatching can be reduced to local disunification, and then provide two complementary NP-algorithms for finding local solutions of disunification problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 07:45:50 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05621v1", "32 pages, extended version of a paper from RTA'15"], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 21:44:19 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05621v2", "32 pages, extended version of a paper from RTA'15"]], "COMMENTS": "32 pages, extended version of a paper from RTA'15", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["franz baader", "stefan borgwardt", "barbara morawska"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05621"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.05621.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "EXTENDING UNIFICATION IN EL TO DISUNIFICATION: THE CASE OF DISMATCHING AND LOCAL DISUNIFICATION", "authors": [], "emails": ["Franz.Baader@tu-dresden.de", "Stefan.Borgwardt@tu-dresden.de", "Barbara.Morawska@tu-dresden.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 160 9.05 621v 1 [cs.L O] 19 SE"}, {"heading": "1.

Every rule application solves a subsumption or dissubsumption.

(This reduction is a generalization of the problem we have for solving problems in [2]. We will again consider a flat disunification problem and the sets A, Var, and Atnv as in [3]. To simplify the reduction further, we assume that all flat dissumptions in the form X 6 for variables X, Y for variables X, Y are without loss of generality, which can be shown with a transformation similar to Section 3.2."}, {"heading": "7. Related work", "text": "Since the descriptions of logic and modal logic are closely related [32], the results of unification in one of these two domains are transferable to the other. In Modal Logics, unification has largely been regarded as an expression logic with all Boolean operators. [33] An important open problem in the field, however, is the question of whether unification can be decided in the basic modal logic K, which corresponds to DL ALC. It is only known that relatively small extensions of K have an undecidable unification problem [33]. Unification also plays an important role in Modal Logics, since it is basically the problem of admissibility for inference rules [16, 27, 30]. To be more precise, a normal modal logic L induces a theory of equality that addresses equivalence in this logic, where the forms are regarded as terms."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions", "text": "While the complexity of the general problem remains open, we have identified two constraints under which the complexity does not increase compared to pure unification in EL, i.e. remains in NP. We have developed a non-deterministic polynomic reduction of dismatching problems to local disunification problems and presented two algorithms for solving the latter. These procedures extend known algorithms for unification in EL without much negative impact on their performance. In terms of future work, we want to investigate the decisiveness and complexity of general disunification in EL and also consider the case where bottomless solutions are allowed. In contrast to unification, these enhancements make solving the problem more difficult. From a more practical perspective, we also plan to introduce the goal-oriented algorithm for local disunification and evaluate the performance of both presented algorithms for real problems. Furthermore, we will investigate whether a reduction in response to programming (ASP) [17] instead of better performance results."}, {"heading": "37\u201347, 2012.", "text": "[15] Franz Baader, Stefan Borgwardt and Barbara Morawska.
