The present work is based on the assumption that common classification-based approaches to time series interpretation suffer from a set of inherent weaknesses whose ultimate cause lies in the monotonic nature of the deductive reasoning paradigm. In this document we propose a new approach to this problem based on the initial hypothesis that abductive reasoning properly accounts for the human ability to identify and characterize patterns appearing in a time series. The result of the interpretation is a set of conjectures in the form of observations, organized into an abstraction hierarchy, and explaining what has been observed. A knowledge-based framework and a set of algorithms for the interpretation task are provided, implementing a hypothesize-and-test cycle guided by an attentional mechanism. As a promising application domain, the interpretation of the electrocardiogram allows us to highlight the strengths of the present approach in comparison with traditional classification-based approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 08:31:18 GMT  (1362kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05632v1", "40 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "40 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tom\\'as teijeiro", "paulo f\\'elix"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05632"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.05632.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the adoption of abductive reasoning for time series interpretation", "authors": ["T.

Nevertheless, many problems can benefit from certain highlighting features that can direct the attention focus to some limited temporal fragments that can be easily interpreted. Thus, the interpretation of the entire time series can be aligned to a reduced number of initial observations, thereby accelerating the interpretation process. Thus, the definition of abstraction patterns can be transformed into an attention strategy based on highlighting, using a subset of their limitations as a coarse filter to identify a set of plausible observations. For example, the minimal inclination defined by the QRS abstraction pattern is a reliable feature to select more promising signal segments in order to focus the interpretation in the same way as a cardiologist may focus on the prominent spikes in the analysis [when these may be sufficient to start using the signal of some later]."}, {"heading": "6 Strengths of the model: Overcoming some limita-", "text": "In this section, we present some practical examples to illustrate some of the strengths of the proposed interpretation framework and its ability to address typical weaknesses of classification-based approaches."}, {"heading": "6.1 Avoiding a casuistry-based interpretation", "text": "In the time domain, classification-based detection of multiple simultaneous processes usually leads to a case-based proliferation of classes, where normally a new class is required for any possible superimposition of processes to correctly identify all situations. It is common to use a representation in the transformation domain in which certain regular processes are easily separable, but at the expense of a cumbersome representation of time information [21]. In contrast, the hypotheses and test cycle aims to guess the hypotheses that best explain the available evidence, including naturally concurrent hypotheses, as long as they are consistent and not mutually exclusive. The ECG interpretation provides some interesting examples of this type of problems. Atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia caused by independent and erratic contractions of the atrial muscle fibers, is characterized by irregular heart rhythm [31]."}, {"heading": "6.2 Coping with ignorance", "text": "Most of the classifiers solve a separability problem between classes, whether by learning from a training set or by generating prior knowledge, and they are implicitly based on the assumption of the closed world, i.e., each new instance to be classified is assigned to one of the predefined classes. Furthermore, such classifiers may include a refusal option for all those instances that can be misclassified because they appear too close to the classification boundaries [4, 13]. This refusal option is added as another possible response to doubt. However, such classifiers cannot classify new instances of the unknown classes because they cannot express ignorance. An approach to this problem can be found in novelty recognition proposals, which recognize when a new instance does not match the predefined classes, as they are essentially different from those instances."}, {"heading": "6.3 Looking for missing evidence", "text": "Applying the classification paradigm to pattern recognition also carries the potential risk of false negative results. At worst, a false negative result can be interpreted by a policymaker as evidence of absence, leading to interpretation errors with their consequential costs; or at best, as a lack of evidence caused by the lack of a suitable detection tool. Although abduction is fallible and false negative results persist, the hypothesis and test cycle includes a prediction mechanism indicating the expected lack of evidence and, in addition, estimates of when it should occur. Both bottom-up and top-down processing performed along this cycle increase confidence in interpretation as the semantics of each conclusion are expanded according to its explanatory power. Consider, for example, the interpretation problem illustrated in Figure 10."}, {"heading": "6.4 Interpretability of the reasoning process and the results", "text": "The interpretative capability of an argumentation formalism, defined as the ability to understand and evaluate its conclusions, is an essential feature in order to gain adequate confidence for decision-making. [22] In this sense, there are a number of classification methods with good interpretative capability, but methods that typically perform best belong to the so-called black box approaches. The current interpretation framework is capable of justifying any result with respect to the available model. In the face of a solution or partial solution to an interpretation problem, the search path to I0 provides us with a complete detailed record of all the argumentation steps undertaken for this purpose, and any abstraction hypothesis can be attributed to the information supporting it. This interpretation framework is also able to answer why a particular hypothesis has been rejected or neglected in each argumentation step. This is done by examining those branches that lie outside of the path between the STP and the CONP)."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "A new model-based framework for the interpretation of time series is proposed. This framework is based on some basic assumptions, a possible pattern: (i) the interpretation of the behavior of a system from the series of available observations is a kind of conjecture, and as such follows the logic of abduction; (ii) the interpretation task involves both the lower and the upper processing of information along a series of abstraction levels; (iii) on the lower levels of abstraction, the interpretation task is a form of pre-compiled diagnosis of pattern recognition; (iv) the interpretation task involves both the representation of time and the argumentation about time and along the time delivers the knowledge. The model-based representation in the present framework is based on the statement based on the concept of abstraction, the interpretation of pattern, which is a form of pre-compiled knowledge-based pattern recognition; (iv) the contemplation task involves both the representation of time and along the argument of time is also an argument of time."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness as part of the project TIN2014-55183-R.

The present work is based on the assumption that common classification-based approaches to time series interpretation suffer from a set of inherent weaknesses whose ultimate cause lies in the monotonic nature of the deductive reasoning paradigm. In this document we propose a new approach to this problem based on the initial hypothesis that abductive reasoning properly accounts for the human ability to identify and characterize patterns appearing in a time series. The result of the interpretation is a set of conjectures in the form of observations, organized into an abstraction hierarchy, and explaining what has been observed. A knowledge-based framework and a set of algorithms for the interpretation task are provided, implementing a hypothesize-and-test cycle guided by an attentional mechanism. As a promising application domain, the interpretation of the electrocardiogram allows us to highlight the strengths of the present approach in comparison with traditional classification-based approaches.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
