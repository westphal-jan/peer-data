We have also designed a method of grounding the temporal logic program, which consists in constructing a non-time normal positive program with variables fed to an ASP solver in order to obtain the possible new arbitrary constants to the universe.We have also designed a method of grounding the temporal logic program, which consists of creating a non-time normal positive program with variables fed to an ASP solver in order to directly obtain the set of variable substitutions that are to be performed for each rule."}, {"heading": "Appendix. Proofs", "text": "The proof for Proposition 3: Consider the extended program. This is an infinitely positive (non-temporal) logic program. Using the known results of (van Emden and Kowalski 1976), we know that it has a Herbrand model LM that can contain an infinite set of atoms in the signature of ground-time facts. Furthermore, its unique stable model due to its positive signature is exactly I. In the face of any set of ground-time facts, we can have a one-to-one correspondence to an LTL interpretation I with facts (I) = I. Through Theorem 1, J is a stable model of facts (J) = J, with facts (J) = J is a time-stable model of ground-time facts. Finally, since I have the unique stable model of ground-time facts (I) = I.
