E-mails can be delivered by an individual, such as a student or researcher or an institution. To be clearer in the rest of the paper, we will provide some definitions: 1. Process model: is the general representation of all process instincts. Process model describes a business process that is applied to achieve a specific goal. It is an interconnected graph of nodes and edges that are applied during the process, and the edges that connect the nodes represent the flow between activities. Mainly, process mining techniques are applied to event logs to derive their corresponding process models. 2. Instance / case: An instance is a specific execution of the process model. There can be several ways to execute the same business process."}, {"heading": "3 Phase 1: Email Log Preprocessing", "text": "The first step consists of a series of e-mails that are pre-processed to clean up and translate into a structured format that is suitable for mining. E-mails are unstructured data that should be translated into the format expected by the mining tools. Part of the content of the message may be useless for our analysis. For this reason, data cleanup is an important step. In addition, attributes that describe e-mails (used in similarity measurement) may be of different data types. Therefore, it is essential to perform some pre-processing and normalization of the data before starting the analysis. Below, we will describe the steps of cleansing, displaying and normalizing data."}, {"heading": "3.1 Cleansing", "text": "We use the R statistical language text mining library to pre-process inbox mails. Emails can contain a lot of words or symbols that are not for our analysis, such as stopwords, numbers or punctuation marks. The R statistical language provides several built-in functions that can perform special word pre-processing tasks, such as removing stopwords, removing numbers, removing punctuation marks and lowering capitals, etc. This helps to optimize similarity measurement between the contents of emails."}, {"heading": "3.2 Representation of Data", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it only takes a few days to get a result."}, {"heading": "4 Phase 2 - Clustering emails belonging to the same process model", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live."}, {"heading": "5 Phase 3: Discovering the Process Model", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Finding the process instances", "text": "After grouping the e-mails into different clusters according to the process to which they belong, the next step is to discover process instances. For example, if a cluster contains all messages exchanged for a professional travel organization, we want to group all messages relating to a particular travel organization (participation in the COOPIS '16 conference), i.e. a process instance or a case in which the general process topic is participation in a conference. To this end, we again use hierarchical clusters as e-mail grouping techniques for the same reasons as in Section 4. The difference this time will be in the similarity formula. We calculate the distance between e-mails in a cluster by applying several combinations of attributes. We examine the use of the combination of the three attributes subject, body and time stamp in the assessment of similarity and their effects on the quality of process instances discovery. We make a comparison between the sub-cluster quality when we use the (body content) and the subject (ii), the body content (ii) and the evaluation of the body (ii)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Clustering emails of the same activity", "text": "In fact, it is such that the majority of them are able to survive themselves without there being a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process"}, {"heading": "5.3 Labeling emails with activity names", "text": "In this step, we will explain how we label the activities, i.e. how we give an activity name (obtained by k-means clustering in the previous step) to all emails in a group, with the help of the user. At the end of the k-means cluster phase, the user is asked to name the medoid of each cluster. The given label is considered the activity name of all emails in this group (emails originating from different process cases).We can take advantage of the fact that each group of emails is labeled with an activity name to solve the problem that researchers face when applying classification techniques for speech recognition. As mentioned above, it is not practical to manually label all emails in the training set as input for the classification algorithm. Thus, these labels can be used to train classifiers for activity detection. Specifically, we plan to classify the cluster 1-based means in new cluster centers to classify the next-door ones."}, {"heading": "5.4 Deducing the process model", "text": "At this stage, each e-mail is assigned to a cluster (with ClusterID) in which a cluster represents a process topic, and a process instance (with InstanceID) that is labeled with an activity name. This data can be used as input for any process mining technique to obtain the business process model. In the log obtained, each activity should be accompanied by a corresponding event. However, at the moment we assume that the event is \"complete.\" The goal of workflow mining is to extract information about processes from the input log. Users can apply different process mining algorithms. In the survey by Van der Aalst et al. [17], several algorithms are mentioned. In Claes et al. [1], the five most commonly used process mining techniques are presented in ProM. The result of this step will be a process model for each cluster. This model illustrates the process that is followed in the mail exchange process for a particular instance (e-mail)."}, {"heading": "6 Implementation and Use Case Study", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached. \"We have never waited so long,\" he says, \"but we have never waited so long to be able to find a solution.\" This year, he says, \"we have never waited so long to be able to put a solution in place.\""}, {"heading": "7 Related Work", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that only once in history will there be such a process to determine to what extent it is a solution that it is."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a framework for mining the process models underlying an e-mail log, which is capable of handling e-mails that are hung in different process models. Hierarchical and k-mean cluster algorithms are used to cluster e-mails by topic, then according to the process instance to which they belong, and finally for tagging e-mail activities. We demonstrated a use case that demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed solution based on logs of e-mails from two different process topics: scheduling and requests for conference travel allowances. In future work, we plan to implement the activity detection phase based on the clusters obtained. We will also examine how approaches to language activities can help define more precisely the activity event associated with an e-mail and activity loop. In addition, we will expand the framework by considering e-mails as an entity (rather than just one set of activities), but also by integrating it into one set of multiple entities."}], "references": [{"title": "Process mining and the prom framework: An exploratory survey", "author": ["Jan Claes", "Geert Poels"], "venue": "In Business Process Management Workshops - BPM 2012 International Workshops, Tallinn, Estonia, September", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Learning to classify email into speech acts", "author": ["William W.
