This type of data can prove extremely useful for many types of studies. As this type of data is per se atomic, any observation can be used as a recording of a single event between a source and a target, providing a broken down view of political events. This means that the data can be used to examine interactions below the usual monthly or annual aggregation levels. Moreover, event data has proven useful in predicting conflict models since the finer resolution of time, in order to gain better leverage over the prediction problem than is possible with the highly aggregate (2013, 2014, Brandt et)."}, {"heading": "2 Political Event Ontologies", "text": "Political event dates have existed in various forms since the 1970s. Two of the original political event datasets were the World Event Interaction Survey (WEIS) and the Conflict and Peace Data Bank (COPDAB) (Azar, 1980; McClelland, 1976). These two datasets were eventually replaced by the projects created by Philip Schrodt and various col-ar Xiv: 160 9.06 239v 1 [cs.C L] 20 September 20laborators. Generally, these projects were characterized by the use of the Conflict and Mediation Event Observations (CAMEO), which include ontology and automated, machine coding instead of human coding (Gerner et al., 2001; Schrodt et al., 2008). CAMEO ontology consists of 20 \"top-level\" categories that include actions such as \"Make Statement\" or \"Protest.\" Each of these twenty top-level categories contains hierarchically ordered categories."}, {"heading": "2.1 Lower Resolution Ontologies", "text": "While CAMEO ontology provides a fine-grained coding of political events within the 20 top-level categories, a small but compelling set of literature suggests that this level of granularity is not necessary to answer many of the event data known as QuadClasses on 1gdeltproject.org 2phoenixdata.organswer. Schrodt (2006), for example, suggests that subdividing CAMEO ontology into much lower-resolution categories known as QuadClasses provides enough information to perform accurate out-of-sample predictions of relevant political events. Furthermore, Schein et al. (2016) suggest that it is possible to restore this latent structure of coded events. These quad-class variables, divided along conflict / cooperation and material / verbal axes, capture the information described in the papers above."}, {"heading": "3 Current Approaches", "text": "The current state of the art for CAMEO-coded political events is provided by the PETRARCH23 coder.4 The key features of PETRARCH2 include a deep dependence on information3https: / / github.com / openeventdata / petrarch24Other codersn exist, such as the ACCENT software, which is but not publicly available. PETRARCH2 and ACCENT approach event coding in much the same way, however.from a constituency Parsebaum comes from the Stanford CoreNLP software, but the exact operational details of PETRARCH2 and ACCENT coding are from the election period, however.from a constituency Parse."}, {"heading": "4 Statistical Approaches", "text": "In order to replace the parser-based methods for identifying an event, a new system needs to identify which of the four QuadClass variables, material conflict, material cooperation, verbal conflict or verbal cooperation the event belongs to. To achieve this, this essay uses Convolutionary Neural Networks. This essay takes into account two neural architectures for classifying a political event. The first is a one-dimensional ConvNet with pre-formed word embedding functions, as described in Kim (2014). In short, it is a relatively flat network with three parallel revolutionary layers and two fully connected layers. The fully connected layers each comprise 150 and 4 units. The dropout is applied to the two fully connected layers, so meaningful connections are learned from the model. The details of the model layers are in Table 1. The second model is a character ConvNet, based on the work of Zhang et al (2015). The character ConvNet is a modified architecture that contains multiple architectures."}, {"heading": "5 Data", "text": "The data sets used in this thesis are in Table 3. Each of the \"softly marked\" data sets has QuadClass labels applied by PETRARCH2. The use of PETRARCH2 is necessary to generate enough training samples for the various classification algorithms to have an impact on the classification task. Thus, if a sentence in the English corpus is called a material conflict, that label is transferred to the aligned sentence in the Arabic corpus. If several alignments occur, the label is transferred to each of the relevant sentences. The next set of data is the same set of labeled Arabic sentences executed by the mechanical translation software Joshua (Weese et al., 2011). These data sets provide machine-translated information for each of the relevant sentences."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "Table 4 shows the results of different models for classifying a sentence into one of four quadclasses. In general, it is clear that the character-based ConvNets perform much better than the word-based models. The difference is less dramatic for English language input, a 9% difference in accuracy. However, for Arabic-language input, the difference is striking: the character model is more than 20% more accurate than the word-based model. This is probably due to problems with tokenization and morphology when using the word-based models. Even more impressive is the ability of the Arabic-based models to perform well, even with a relatively small corpus5 The specific corpus can be found at https: / / www.ldc. upenn.edu / collaborations / past-projects / orale / data / orale-pubs.These results show that character-based ConvNets are suitable and powerful models for classifying politically relevant events."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "This work has shown that modern approaches to natural language processing, especially deep neural networks, offer a promising way to extract politically relevant events. The methods shown in this work can transcend both ontologies and languages and offer a level of flexibility unseen in CAMEO-encoded political event data, which will open new avenues for social science research. While these methods are promising, much work remains to develop a fully functional event extraction pipeline, as an example that goes beyond the boundaries of CAMEO to encode events such as crime events in Spanish-language news sources, which will open up new avenues of social science research. For example, if a meeting between three actors takes place that would typically lead to nine coded events when the various combinations of actors and binary relationships are worked on."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the DARPA Quantitative Crisis Response Program."}], "references": [{"title": "Improving forecasts of international events of interest", "author": ["Arva et al.2013] Bryan Arva", "John Beieler", "Ben Fisher", "Gustavo Lara", "Philip A.
