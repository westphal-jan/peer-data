These applications can range from multi-faceted surfing of articles to product recommendations to big data analytics. In the online recruitment domain, we refer to the classification of job ads by predefined or custom occupation categories as classification. A large-scale job title classification system can drive various downstream applications such as semantic search, job recommendations and job market analyses. In this essay we discuss experiments that have been conducted to improve our own job classification system."}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Many e-commerce and web properties have the need to automatically classify millions of items into thousands of categories with a high degree of accuracy. Such large-scale item classification systems have many downstream applications such as product recommendations, multi-faceted search, semantic search, and big data analysis. In the online recruiting field, job classification can support applications such as labor market analysis, job recommendations, and semantic search. We refer to the classification of job ads (text documents consisting of titles, descriptions, and requirement fields) into predefined or custom occupational groups as classification. For the automatic classification of job titles, we have developed a system called Carotene that: i) has a taxonomy discovery component that builds clustering techniques from data sets to create a custom job title taxonomy, and ii) uses a two-tiered gross registry and fine-tiered SVM classification to create a custom job title taxonomy."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "In fact, it is true that we will be able to set out in search of new paths to follow."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "4.1 Test Use Case We evaluate performance by assigning KNN's job classification task, i.e. classifying the job title of the query according to the titles that appear most similar to our knowledge: \"Entry-level Java Developer,\" \"Matlab programmer New york,\" \"J2EE engineer,\" if k = 3. Then the query title is classified as \"Java Developer,\" because two of the three most similar titles (\"Entry-level Java Developer\" and \"J2EE Engineer\") are normalized and classified as \"Java Developer.\" 4.2 Results Our test data contain 1667 human-labeled query titles and the knowledge base contains 1002737 reference titles that fall into 5425 predefined employment categories. We used the accuracy metric as a benchmark. Figure 1 shows the performance of all methods with deviations from 1 to WS > W is rated only with the grade W (value c-1)."}, {"heading": "5. FUTURE WORK", "text": "Currently, all word vectors contribute equally to the construction of document vectors. We will try a weighted version of these approaches, as some words (e.g. senior, junior) may not be important and even cause noise when we measure the similarity (e.g. NY, immediate rent)."}, {"heading": "6.
