EEG mainly reflects the sum of excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials on the dendrites of ensembles of neurons with parallel geometric orientation. While the electric field generated by different neurons is too weak to be absorbed by surface EEG electrodes, as neuronal actions must be synchronous across a huge number of neurons, the electric fields of individual neurons are aggregated, resulting in effects measurable outside the skull [8]. The EEG brain signals, also known as brainwaves, are traditionally decomposed (by band filtering or an appropriate transformation) and studied within certain frequency bands defined by Greek letters and in the order of the central frequency increase."}, {"heading": "3 Methods", "text": "This section briefly introduces the methodological elements used in the realization of the proposed framework. Specifically, instantaneous signal energy, activation asymmetry index and a CFC estimator were used to derive brain wave descriptors (i.e. features reflecting neural activity associated with listening to music) and the meaning of each descriptor (or a combination of descriptors) was evaluated using distance correlation. ELMs, an important class of artificial neural networks (ANNs), were used to convert the derived patterns into values representing the listener's assessment."}, {"heading": "3.1 Signal Descriptors", "text": "Brain waves are often characterized by their prominent frequency and their (signal) energy content. Here, we performed a quasi-immediate parameterization of the content of brain waves by means of Hilbert Transformation.The signal from each sensor x (t) was initially filtered within the range corresponding to the frequency band of a brain rhythm (such as the \u03b4 rhythm) and the envelope of the filtered activity rhythm (t) was considered to be the instantaneous strength of associated oscillatory activity. Apart from the amplitude of each brain rhythm, its relative contribution was also derived from the normalization of total signal strength (summed up from all brain rhythms).In neuroscience research, activation refers to the change in EEG activity in response to a stimulus and is of great interest to investigate differences in the way the two hemispheres are activated."}, {"heading": "3.2 Distance Correlation", "text": "In statistics and probability theory, distance correlation is a measure of statistical dependence between two random variables or two random vectors of arbitrary, not necessarily equal dimensions. The distance correlation, which is called R, generalizes the idea of correlation and has the important property that R (X, Y) = 0 if and only if X and Y are independent of each other. R index fulfills 0 \u2264 R \u2264 1 and, unlike Pearson's correlation coefficient, is suitable for detecting non-linear relationships [23]. In this work, he was the central mechanism for identifying neuronal corrections in subjective music evaluation by recognizing associations between the results of signal descriptors (or their combinations) and the values of the listener."}, {"heading": "3.3 Learning Machines", "text": "Machine learning deals with the development and implementation of algorithms that can build models capable of generalizing a specific function from a set of given examples. Regression is a supervised learning task that can handle machine learning at levels similar or even higher than the usual statistical techniques and - mainly - without imposing hypotheses. In this paper, the decoding of subjective music evaluation was dismissed as a (non-linear) regression problem. Subsequently, a model was sought (i.e. learned from experimental data) that would perform the mapping of patterns derived from brain activity descriptors to subjective music evaluation. ELMs appeared to be an appropriate choice due to their documented ability to efficiently perform difficult tasks without requiring extensive training sessions. [24] They are fed with a single layer of hidden nodes in which the weights connecting inputs to hidden nodes are never randomly assigned and [25]."}, {"heading": "4 Implementation and Experiments", "text": "Our experiments developed in two different directions: firstly, a series of experiments were conducted to use the experimental data to determine a brain wave pattern that would best reflect an individual's music evaluation and train the learning machine on pieces of music of known subjective evaluation; secondly, additional experiments were conducted that implemented real-time scoring by the trained ELM machine to justify the proposed BCI in a more naturalistic setting; and, in both cases, the songs were delivered via a popular music streaming service (Spotify), which facilitates the registration of listener feedback (\"like\" - \"dislike\") to adjust the musical content to their taste and make suggestions for new tracks."}, {"heading": "4.1 Participants", "text": "All 5 participants were healthy students of the Faculty of Computer Science at AUTH. Their average age was 23 years and listening to music was part of their daily routine. They signed a consent form after being explained the experimental procedures."}, {"heading": "4.2 Data Acquisition", "text": "In view of the ease of use of the proposed scheme, we have used in our implementations a state-of-the-art commercial wireless dry sensor device (e.g. the Muse device from Interaxon - http: / / www.choosemuse.com) that provides a 4-channel EEG signal, the topological arrangement of which can be seen in Figure 1. Signals are digitized at a sampling frequency of 220 Hz. Data is transmitted under OSC, a protocol for communication between computers, sound synthesizers and other multimedia devices optimized for modern networking technology [26]."}, {"heading": "4.3 Experimental Procedure", "text": "Before placing the headphones, the subjects sat in a comfortable chair and the volume of the speakers was adjusted to a desirable level. They were advised to refrain from body and head movements and to enjoy the music experience. Recording was divided into sessions lasting 30 minutes. The music streaming service was operated in radio mode, so each participant was randomly given selected songs (from the genre of his or her preferences) while his or her brain activity was registered. Among the songs were advertisements. This part of the recordings was isolated from the rest. The recording process was integrated into MATLAB, along with all the necessary information from the streaming audio signal (i.e. song ID card, time stamp for the beginning and end of each song). Participants rated each of the songs belonging to one of the integers {1,2,3,4,5} as a score during a separate session immediately after the recording ended. These scores, together with the brain signals extracted from the entire process, were repeated for each training set."}, {"heading": "4.4 Data Analysis", "text": "The pre-processing of the signal included the removal of 50 Hz components (through a built-in notch filter in MuseIO - the software that connects and transmits data from Muse), the removal of DC offsets and the removal of signal segments corresponding to the first 5 seconds of each song (to avoid artificial transients).The digital processing included i) band-pass filtering to derive brain waves from standard brain rhythms, ii) Hilbert transform to derive their momentary amplitude and phase calculations, and iii) calculation of the descriptors described in Section 3.1. To increase the frequency resolution, we divided the \u03b2 rhythm into \u03b2low (13-20 Hz) and \u03b2high (20-30 Hz) subbands and conducted descriptors separately. Similarly, the \u03b3 rhythm was divided into low (30-49 Hz) and high (51-90 Hz total) phases, with the individual phases divided into 30 phases during the workout."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Selecting Features - The synthesized biomarker", "text": "The selection of characteristics was based on the distance correlation values R of all signal descriptors averaged across all participants (Fig.2), the descriptors were ranked in descending order (in terms of their expressivity in music evaluation), and a dynamic programming method was used. Starting with the characteristic of the highest R, we systematically traversed the ranking for combinations that would ultimately maximize the distance correlation, resulting in a particular combination of 5 characteristics, the synthesized music evaluation biomarker, which included the normalized temporal asymmetry index in the \u03b2low band, the relative energy of the \u03b1 band of temporal electrodes, the \u03b3low-high PAC at the FP1 sensor, and the relative energy of the \u03b8 band at SP9. The relevance of this descriptor for music evaluation showed a dependence on the length of the segment on which it was based (using the time averages of all participants).3"}, {"heading": "5.2 Designing the ELM", "text": "The number of neurons in the hidden player, the only parameter that can be set in ELMs, was selected as the smallest number of neurons, so that the training and test error converged to an acceptable level, less than 0.01."}, {"heading": "5.3 Evaluating the music-evaluation BCI", "text": "The proposed BCI was evaluated in two ways: during the first phase, the available data (the biomarker patterns of each of the five participants along with the associated ratings) were randomly distributed in a ratio of 60% -40% for cross-validation; an ELM was trained on the basis of the first set and its performance quantified on the basis of the second set; the entire procedure was repeated 10 times and the averaged results are reported; the normalized mean square error (RMSE) as defined for regression tasks was 0.063 \u00b1 0.0093 (mean \u00b1 std between participants); and for comparison purposes, we also used Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which performed slightly worse. Although the difference was marginal, the very short training time was another factor in favor of using ELMs; during the second stage, a pilot online BCI was developed to realize the test phase of the ELM in a realistic environment."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "This paper is the report of a pilot study in which we have tried to link the brain waves of the listener to the subjective aesthetic pleasure induced by music. The main novelty of the presented proof-of-concept is that it was realized on the basis of a modern consumer EEG device and in conjunction with a popular on-demand music streaming service (Spotify). Our results suggest that signals from a limited number of sensors (located across frontal and temporal brain areas) can be combined into a predictable biomarker that reflects the subjective music rating of the listener. This Brainwave derivative can be efficiently decoded by regression ELM and therefore leads to a reliable reading of the listener. The main advantage of the approach is that the idea of using EEG wearables in daily activities comes together and that it is readily embedded within the on-time education (see music)."}, {"heading": "7 References", "text": "The results of the study show that most of them who consider themselves able to actually act as human beings, are human beings who are able to understand the world, understand themselves, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, and understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand,"}], "references": [{"title": "Electroencephalography: basic principles, clinical applications, and related fields", "author": ["E.

Based on the established -neuroscientifically soundconcepts of brainwave frequency bands, activation asymmetry index and cross-frequency-coupling (CFC), we introduce a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system that automatically assigns a rating score to the listened song. Our research operated in two distinct stages: i) a generic feature engineering stage, in which features from signal-analytics were ranked and selected based on their ability to associate music induced perturbations in brainwaves with listener's appraisal of music. ii) a personalization stage, during which the efficiency of extreme learning machines (ELMs) is exploited so as to translate the derived patterns into a listener's score. Encouraging experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the system, are presented.", "creator": "Word"}}}
