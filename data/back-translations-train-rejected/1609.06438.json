This paper investigates big strategic (non-cooperative) games where a finite number of individual players each have a large number of continuous decision variables and input data points. Such high-dimensional decision spaces and big data sets lead to computational challenges, relating to efforts in non-linear optimization scaling up to large systems of variables. In addition to these computational challenges, real-world players often have limited information about their preference parameters due to the prohibitive cost of identifying them or due to operating in dynamic online settings. The challenge of limited information is exacerbated in high dimensions and big data sets. Motivated by both computational and information limitations that constrain the direct solution of big strategic games, our investigation centers around reductions using linear transformations such as random projection methods and their effect on Nash equilibrium solutions. Specific analytical results are presented for quadratic games and approximations. In addition, an adversarial learning game is presented where random projection and sampling schemes are investigated.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Sep 2016 07:10:13 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06438v1", "7 pages, 1 figure; CDC'16 to appear"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 1 figure; CDC'16 to appear", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["tansu alpcan", "benjamin i p rubinstein", "christopher leckie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06438"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.06438.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Large-Scale Strategic Games and Adversarial Machine Learning", "authors": ["Tansu Alpcan", "Benjamin I.

Each player chooses a pure strategy (decision) vector, xi-i): X \u2192 R, where xi and compact decision X i RM is set. The common decision space of the game is therefore the product space X = X1 \u00d7. (XN) RM \u00b7 N.

ANALYSIS OF LARGE-SCALE AND REDUCED GAMES", "text": "A fundamental question of interest in large-scale games is how a Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution for the original game (G B, refers to the tractable game G T, which is achieved by a linear transformation like a random projection in the decision room. \u2212 First, basic results for the general case of N players are discussed. \u2212 Then, specific results for two player square games are presented. \u2212 If the cost function of the player i, Ji in a large-scale game G B is convex, then J is also convex for the general case of the tractable game G T. \u2212 The result is due to the linearity of the mapping T, see e.g. [37, Chap 3.2.2].The following known result from [38] establishes sufficient conditions for the existence of NE in the game G B.Proposition 4.

LARGE-SCALE GAMES FOR ADVERSARIAL MACHINE LEARNING", "text": "Adversarial machine learning (AdvML) is the study of effective machine (or statistical) learning techniques against an adversary who aims to disrupt the learning process and therefore make subsequent malicious decisions. Many adversarial learning problems can be presented as a safety game. In addition, high-dimensional and high-volume data generated by modern systems are naturally led to large-scale game formulations similar to the approach discussed in the previous sections. A specific adversarial learning problem based on linear support machines (SVMs) is next investigated, leading to a linear game formulation. Consider a linear SVM as a binary classification that is labeled with the help of a large and high-dimensional dataset consisting of corresponding vectors \u2212 d."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "First, a characterization and basic definitions of large strategic games were presented; second, motivated by information constraints, the reduction of large strategic games by linear transformations such as random projections and their effects on equilibrium solutions was discussed; third, a series of analytical results on large convex and square games with two players and their equilibrium solutions was achieved; and finally, a specific formulation was used for context-specific selection criteria for linear reductions in large game areas. Major strategic games in the sense of this paper can be considered as complementary to their finite state and / or action solutions and thus to the abstraction literature of the game; there are several interesting future research directions in the continuous core game domain; one open direction is the further investigation of specific transformation techniques for reducing large game and / or action methods."}, {"heading": "VI.

Such high-dimensional decision spaces and big data sets lead to computational challenges, relating to efforts in non-linear optimization scaling up to large systems of variables. In addition to these computational challenges, real-world players often have limited information about their preference parameters due to the prohibitive cost of identifying them or due to operating in dynamic online settings. The challenge of limited information is exacerbated in high dimensions and big data sets. Motivated by both computational and information limitations that constrain the direct solution of big strategic games, our investigation centers around reductions using linear transformations such as random projection methods and their effect on Nash equilibrium solutions. Specific analytical results are presented for quadratic games and approximations. In addition, an adversarial learning game is presented where random projection and sampling schemes are investigated.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
