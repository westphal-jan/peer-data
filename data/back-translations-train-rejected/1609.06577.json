The exacerbation of the phenomenon is that NPS can be easily sold and bought online. Here, we consider large corpora of textual posts, published on online forums specialized on drug discussions, plus a small set of known substances and associated effects, which we call seeds. We propose a semi-supervised approach to knowledge extraction, applied to the detection of drugs (comprising NPS) and effects from the corpora under investigation. Based on the very small set of initial seeds, the work highlights how a contrastive approach and context deduction are effective in detecting substances and effects from the corpora.

We have collected more than a decade of contributions from Bluelight and Drugsforum. As shown in Table 1, the available data includes more than half a million users and more than 4.6 million posts. Data has been collected through web scraping and stored in a relational database for further queries. These forums have been analyzed early and in part in [23] and then examined in detail [9]. Here, we present exactly the same data sets to show how it is possible to extract knowledge from text, with only a few seeds serving as the starting point for the algorithm introduced in Section 3."}, {"heading": "2.1 Seeds", "text": "We have downloaded a list of 416 drug names of popular psychoactive substances, including the slang used by consumers to describe them generally, from the Talk to Frank8 project website and a data set of 8,206 medicines derived from Drugbank9, which represents a basic truth for known medicines. We have also compiled a list of 129 symptoms that are typically associated with the adoption of substances."}, {"heading": "3 The DAGON methodology (DAta Generated jargON)", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "3.1 Training phase", "text": "We are provided with a list of examples for both the drugs and the effects, as described in Section 2.1. This list of entry dates is training for the classification task and we call it list of seeds. Therefore, each entry in the target drug forums has been indexed by a full-text index (Apache Lucene11) as a single documentation. The training phase is as follows: (i) Let TS and TE be the set of sample contexts for which substance and effect classes are initialized respectively blank. (ii) From the lists of seeds, we select a new seed (a drug name) for the substance class and an action name (an action name) for the effects class. A seed is therefore an example of the corresponding class that is taken from Section 2.1. See Section 3.2 for heuristics to select a seed from the list. (iii) We use the full text index name to get the text names that we contain only the items containing the little bit."}, {"heading": "3.2 Choosing a seed", "text": "Obtaining a large seed list is often costly, as it may require manual annotation of texts or providing the algorithm with a first set of words. Therefore, it is crucial to choose an effective seed, taking into account several aspects: (a) Is the seed mentioned verbatim enough in the current iteration of the classification model? Otherwise, the seed will only serve to collect a small number of additional training elements, and it will not affect the model enough; (b) Does the seed add new information? The most effective seeds are those whose contexts are misclassified by the current iteration of the classification model. To select the most useful, we could select from the list of available unused seeds those whose contexts are often misclassified."}, {"heading": "3.3 Classification of a new candidate", "text": "At the end of the training phase, the classifying M-CTX - based on the contexts of the selected seeds - was trained to classify either substances or effects. Here, we describe the procedure by which we determine to which class (substance or effect) a new candidate c belongs, and the new candidates are selected from the terms more relevant to the forums. Such terms are extracted according to the contrasting approach described in Section 3, Sub-Task (a). The training phase generates a model M-CTX by which contexts the term is classified - we define here a model M-CTX by which the term itself is classified in substance, effect or \"none of the kind described above.\" M-CTX is defined as a function of a candidate c, and the existing model M-CTX as follows: 1. We apply steps (iii) and (iv) of the algorithm described in 3.1 to obtain the contexts for c (xc)."}, {"heading": "3.4 Linking substances to effects", "text": "Here we outline a simple way to associate the substances mentioned in the drug forums with the effects they produce. In indexing a post, the significant terminological elements found in that post are linked to it as metadata. As described in Section 3.3, the terminology elements have been extracted using a contrasting approach, as in [16]. We assume that the terminology elements found in each post have already been marked with substances or effects, using the method described in Section 3.3. Thus, if we are looking for mentions of a particular substance, we can use the corresponding metadata for each post accordingly. We can then sort the list of effects by frequency from the matadata - it is very likely that these effects are related to the substance we are looking for."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We present a series of experiments on the data described in Section 2. First, we need to identify a list of candidates (unless we want to try to classify each term - a possible but undesirable strategy for detecting seeds or effects from which drugs are selected), second, we need to identify terms and phrases that are common within the community, and second, we need to apply the first subtexts outlined in Section 3. Then, we apply the drugs described in Section 3.3 to assign either the class substance or the effects to candidates, and not evaluate any of the above terms, and evaluate the performance of the classification. M ctx intermediate classes have been trained with linear kernels. [5] We report on experiments and results for the Bluelight Forum. The lists used to select seeds and results and validate results have been described in Section 2.1."}, {"heading": "5 Related work", "text": "In fact, it is the case that we are in a position to find a solution that enables us to find a solution that paves the way to the future."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We automatically identify and classify substances and effects from posts on drug forums using a semi-supervised text mining approach. To create a small training set, human intervention is required, but the algorithm is capable of automatically detecting substances and effects with so little initial information. We believe that our proposal will help to raise drug users \"awareness of the risks of their choices and counteract the proliferation of NPS, which is spreading at an impressively high rate on the online market."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgements", "text": "This publication is the result of the project CASSANDRA (Computer Assisted Solutions for Studying the Availability aNd Distribution of new psychoActive substances), which was funded by the European Union in the framework of the ISEC programme \"Prevention and Combating Crime\" [JUST2013 / ISEC / DRUGS / AG / 6414]."}], "references": [{"title": "Theseus: Categorization by context", "author": ["G.
