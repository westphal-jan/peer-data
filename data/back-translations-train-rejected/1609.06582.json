At the same time, however, the fine-grained collection of user locations raises serious privacy concerns, as this can reveal sensitive information about the users, such as, life style, political and religious inclinations, or even identities. In this paper, we study the feasibility of crowd-sourced mobility analytics over aggregate location information: users periodically report their location, through using a privacy-preserving aggregation protocol, so that the server can only recover aggregates -- i.e., how many, but not which, users are in a region at a given time. We experiment with real-world mobility datasets obtained from the Transport For London authority and the San Francisco Cabs network, and present a novel methodology based on time series modeling that is geared to forecast traffic volumes in regions of interest and to detect mobility anomalies in them. In the presence of anomalies, we also make enhanced traffic volume predictions by feeding our model with additional information from correlated regions. Finally, we present and evaluate a mobile app prototype, called Mobility Data Donors (MDD), in terms of computation, communication, and energy overhead, demonstrating the real-world deployability of our techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Sep 2016 14:31:15 GMT  (235kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06582v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 9 Oct 2016 15:58:06 GMT  (1775kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06582v2", "Published at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.CY cs.LG", "authors": ["apostolos pyrgelis", "emiliano de cristofaro", "gordon ross"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06582"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.06582.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Privacy-Friendly Mobility Analytics using Aggregate Location Data", "authors": ["Apostolos Pyrgelis", "Emiliano De Cristofaro", "Gordon J.

We build on the work of Box et al. [8], which presents an iterative method for selecting and estimating ARMA models.Given a time series of Yt, an ARMA model is a tool for understanding and predicting future values in Yt. The model is commonly referred to as ARMA (p, q), where AR (p) refers to the authoregressive model of the order p and MA (q) to the moving average model of the order q. Specifically, an ARMA (p, q) model is defined as: Yt = c + p \u2212 Yt \u2212 i + t \u00b7 t \u00b7 t \u00b7 i \u00b7 t \u00b7 i \u2212 t \u2212 (b \u2212 ar)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Vector Auto-Regression", "text": "We also study how to improve traffic volume predictions in the presence of anomalies (see Section 3.4), so we also try to discover correlated ROIs and use their aggregated time series along with a vector-auto-regression (VAR) model to make improved predictions. VARs are statistical models used in econometrics to capture linear interdependencies between multiple time series, and consist of a generalization of uni-variant autoregressive models (AR models) that allow for more than one development variable. All variables in a VAR model are treated symmetrically and each has an equation that bases its development on both its own delays and those of the other model variables. VAR modeling requires prior knowledge of a list of variables that can be hypothesized to influence each other (VAR model)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Spearman Correlation", "text": "To discover correlated ROIs, we use the Spearman correlation coefficient, which is a non-parametric measure of statistical dependence between the precedence of two variables. [12] It provides an estimate of how well the relationship between two variables can be described by a monotonous function and, unlike Pearson, it does not assume that both variables are normally distributed. In the face of two variables W, Z, the Spearman correlation coefficient is defined as follows: rs = 1 \u2212 6 \u00b7 \u2211 d2in \u00b7 (n2 \u2212 1) (3), where di = rg (Wi) \u2212 rg (Zi) is the difference between the two ranges of each observation and n the number of observations. Similar to other correlation measures, Spearman reaches values between \u2212 1 and + 1, where 0 implies no correlation and \u2212 1 or + 1 implies an exact monotonic relationship. Intuitively, positive correlations imply that W increases, so does Z, while negative correlations mean W increases."}, {"heading": "2.4 Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to put themselves in the world, a world in which they must put themselves at the centre."}, {"heading": "3.

We focus on the 100 busiest stations and the 100 busiest stations. As our preliminary analysis shows that stations are stationary and have a strong auto-regressive structure, we turn to ARMA modelling (cf. Section 2.1). For each of these stations, we feed the ARMA model with the values of the last 6 days of its aggregated and de-seasonal time series Yit, respectively. We train the model with the first 5 days of Dit and test it against the last (\"test day\") of Yit using a recursive approach to predict its hourly traffic."}, {"heading": "3.3 Detecting Traffic Anomalies", "text": "Next, we focus on capturing traffic volume anomalies that our model could not predict with accuracy. This is particularly important for traffic delivery and travel planning as a recommendation for drivers / commuters in the event of traffic accidents, incidents or events causing overcrowding at traffic stations. Again, we use ARMA modeling: Our intuition is to train the model for each ROI and rely on the absolute forecasting error as the confidence interval to detect anomalies. Specifically, since the forecast error is normally distributed nearby, we apply the 3\u03c3 rule and use upper and lower confidence intervals intervals based on the anomaly when we detect an anomaly when: et > < 2 where the logical OR operator is, we include + 3\u03c3 rule and put upper and lower confidence intervals intervals when we detect an anomaly when we detect an anomaly when we detect an anomaly when we detect an anomaly when we detect an anomaly when we detect an anomaly when we find an anomaly in the OR operator, we include a + 3\u03c3 rule and put upper and lower trust intervals when we detect an anomaly when we find an anomaly when we detect an anomaly when we detect an anomaly when we detect an anomaly when we detect an anomaly in the OR operator."}, {"heading": "3.4 Predicting Traffic Volumes in Case of Anomalies", "text": "In this context, it has to be stated that the individual countries are a country in which most people are able to put themselves in a different world, in which most people are able to live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they are able to put themselves into another world, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they are"}, {"heading": "4. A SYSTEM FOR PRIVACY-FRIENDLY MOBILITY ANALYTICS", "text": "Having assessed the usefulness of collecting and using aggregated locations for mobility analyses, we will now examine how such collection can be made possible in a privacy-friendly manner. To this end, we are designing a distributed, collaborative framework whereby users install an application that regularly monitors their locations, stores them locally, and periodically reports them to our server in a privacy-friendly manner using the scalable private aggregation protocol introduced in Section 2.4. 1 Privacy is guaranteed by aggregation, through the scalable private aggregation protocol presented in Section 2.4. Once the server receives the aggregated location data (i.e. counting the presence of users in ROIs), it can use it for mobility analyses, as the privacy of user locations is protected at a time interval."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data Collection", "text": "To support private data collection, we need a secure aggregation protocol that allows a server to learn only aggregate locations (as discussed in Section 2.4, we choose that of Melis et al. [28] because it supports scalability and error tolerance without requiring a trusted third party, which are fundamental factors for the success of a distributed crowd sourcing system. Our system model mirrors that of Melis et al. [28], i.e. it consists of a server or aggregator that facilitates networking and collects the total number of location data from a number of mobile users running the MDD app. There is no other trusted authority. As in [28], we assume that the aggregator and users are honest but curious, i.e. they follow the protocol specifications and do not misrepresent their entries, but try to extract information from other partitions."}, {"heading": "4.2 Experimental Evaluation", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to survive on our own."}, {"heading": "5.

CONCLUSION", "text": "This work explored the feasibility of crowd-sourced mobility analyses using aggregated location data in an environment where users regularly report locations to a server so that the server can only restore aggregates, using a privacy-preserving aggregation protocol. We experimented with real-world mobility data sets sourced from Transport for London and the San Francisco Cabs Network, and demonstrated that aggregated location data can also be useful for predictive analytical tasks such as forecasting traffic volumes in regions of interest (ROIs) and detecting anomalies in them, using a methodology based on modeling time series taking seasonality into account. In the presence of traffic anomalies, we also showed how to improve their traffic volume predictions by using additional information from correlated ROIs (ROIs). Finally, we proposed a data donation system to collect data and prototyping data from a mobile application (we proposed a data mobility application - D) in order to support the data donation of a data donation system (we proposed a data mobility application)."}, {"heading": "7.

At the same time, however, the fine-grained collection of user locations raises serious privacy concerns, as this can reveal sensitive information about the users, such as, life style, political and religious inclinations, or even identities. In this paper, we study the feasibility of crowd-sourced mobility analytics over aggregate location information: users periodically report their location, using a privacy-preserving aggregation protocol, so that the server can only recover aggregates \u2013 i.e., how many, but not which, users are in a region at a given time. We experiment with real-world mobility datasets obtained from the Transport For London authority and the San Francisco Cabs network, and present a novel methodology based on time series modeling that is geared to forecast traffic volumes in regions of interest and to detect mobility anomalies in them. In the presence of anomalies, we also make enhanced traffic volume predictions by feeding our model with additional information from correlated regions. Finally, we present and evaluate a mobile app prototype, called Mobility Data Donors (MDD), in terms of computation, communication, and energy overhead, demonstrating the real-world deployability of our techniques.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
