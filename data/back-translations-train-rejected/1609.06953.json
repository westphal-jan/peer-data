Therefore, we will not repeat material that has already been covered. To the benefit of readers, we can summarize that the DSNS approach involves the automatic analysis of objects (e.g. a chess problem or photo) for their attributes (e.g. number of pieces, figure value or material difference, image resolution, number of colors used), which can be represented in numerical form. The \"creative difference\" (i.e. \"deviation\") between two such objects is then calculated using a simple formula to generate the pseudo-random attributes for two new theoretical objects x."}, {"heading": "2 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN", "text": "The basic idea in this research was to test whether the use of larger images and those of higher quality in the DSNS process, as described in (Iqbal et al., 2016), could improve the quality of the results. For the experiments we have applied in determining a better or better object from within the system, the difference between two aesthetic scores might be small, but this difference is higher than the other. Chesthetica uses an experimentally validated aesthetic model that is able to evaluate chess problems aesthetically in a way that is positively and well correlated with domain-incompetent human assessments (Iqbal et al, 2012). It is the most cost-effective and reliable method of evaluating beauty in chess sequences, as opposed to, say, with human experts who are not only expensive but also physically resilient."}, {"heading": "3 DISCUSSION", "text": "The experimental results indicate that the use of larger images and those of higher quality (i.e. less corrupted) actually improve the results of the DSNS process in terms of the aesthetic quality of the chess problems generated. This is a new or expanded realization of our previous work and highly relevant to the implementation of the DSNS approach in every area of creative creation. Figure 5 shows that each of the average rated chess problems generated with the larger images and smaller images, as explained in Section 2.1. The line or move sequence shown below the board is the most important winning variation. Note that the aesthetic score for each of the problems shown in Figure 5 is closest to the average score achieved during the experiment (refer to Section 2.1), which should give the reader an idea of the quality that can be achieved by taking into account the image size. Most chess players, at least according to the experimental model of aesthetics, are integrated into esthetics."}, {"heading": "4 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Computational creativity is an emerging sub-area of artificial intelligence that allows computers to traverse the theoretical design space in a way that brute computing technology simply cannot. It was previously thought to be limited to the human brain, and various techniques have been developed that show that computers can actually be creative by not only evaluating but also producing objects of creative value. One of the most recent developments is the DSNS approach, which has so far been shown to be capable of composing chess problems of higher quality than random and state-of-the-art approaches. In this article, we have expanded this work by showing that the results can be further improved by using higher quality materials, especially larger and clearer photos when seeding the DSNS process. There are many other permutations that can and should be tested to get a clearer picture of what really works here and what doesn't, but lie outside the framework of the current work and can still be built on."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A: CHESTHETICA PROGRAM AND SETTINGS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}], "references": [{"title": "The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: A New Approach to Computational Creativity, 1st Edition, SpringerBriefs in Cognitive Computation, Springer International Publishing, Switzerland. eBook ISBN 978-3-319-28079-0, Softcover ISBN 978-3-319-28078-3", "author": ["A.
