Definition 1: A theory T is a triple (L, M, | =), where L is a sentence called the language of theory, M is a sentence called models of theory, and | = a subset of M \u00b7 L is a satisfaction relationship. The set L is implicitly defined by a vocabulary (L) of relation and function symbols, each of which has an associated nature. Constant symbols are 0-like function symbols. Each L model M is a tuple containing a universe (M), and for each relationship (function) a symbol of vocabulary and function symbols, each associated with an associated activity."}, {"heading": "Weighted Model Counting", "text": "Semiring programming refers to the conceptual simplicity of weighted model counting (WMC), which we briefly recapitulate here. WMC is an extension of # SAT, in which one simply counts the number of models of a sentence formula (Gomes, Sabharwal, and Selman 2009). In the WMC, one gives a model weight in relation to the letters that apply to the model, and calculates the sum of the weights of all models. Definition 4: Suppose it is a formula from a pronunciation L with a finite vocabulary, and suppose M is the set of L models. Suppose w: lits (L) \u2192 R \u2265 0 is a weight function. In this sense, it is clearly agnostic how weights in the weighting Mw (l) are called weighted model counting (WMC) by others.The formulation elegantly decouples the logical theorem from the weight function."}, {"heading": "Commutative Semirings", "text": "Our programming model is based on algebraic structures called semarings (Kuich 1997); the essential points are as follows: Definition 5: A (commutative) semiring S is a structure (S, B, 0, 1), where S is a set designated as elements of the semiring, and B and O are associative and commutative, 0 the identity for A, and 1 the identity for A. If the multiplication operator is not used, we simply refer to the triple (S, B, 0) as semiring. Example 6: The structure (N, +, \u00d7, 0, 1) is a commutative semiring, in that for each a, b, N, a + 0 = a, a \u00b7 1 = a, a + b = b + a and so on."}, {"heading": "3 Semiring Programming", "text": "Essentially, the semicircular programming scheme is as follows: \u2022 Input: a theory T = (L, M, | =), a theorem \u03c6 L, a commutative semicircle S, and a weight function etc. \u2022 Output: the number referred to as # (\u03c6, w). The scope of these programs is broad, and therefore we need different kinds of generality. Broadly speaking, the distinction boils down to: (a) whether the set of models for a formula is finite or infinite, and (b) whether or not the weight function can be factored through the literals (in this case, the weight function directly denotes the models of a theory). The thrust of this section is: (a) to show how these distinctions subsume important terms of model generation in the literature, 1In the context of L models M, we simply write t = \u0445 M | = E-u to mean that the terms of the finite we are looking at before counting the finite."}, {"heading": "Finite", "text": "Here we generalize the WMC formulation to semi-ring labels, but we also go beyond classical Propositional Logic.Definition 7: We say that the theory T = (L, M, | =) is limited if for each model a formula of first order with a finite Herbrand base is also a finite theory.Definition 8: Suppose T = (L, M, | =) is a finite theory, independent of (say) standard or minimal models. Definition 8: Suppose T = (L, M, |) is a finite theory, which is a finite theory. Suppose S = (S, 0, 1) is a commentary semi-ring."}, {"heading": "Infinite: Non-factorized", "text": "The definition of probability theory (Halmos 1950) is central to the logical characterization of probability theory (Halpern 1990; Chistikov, Dimitrova, and Majumdar 2015).We adapt this term to introduce a general form of calculation. For technical reasons, we assume that the universe of probability theory (Halpern 1990; Dimitrova, and Majumdar 2015) can be limited to any subset of R. (Bistarelli et al. 1999).3We note that the scope of the weight function does not in itself provide the variable assignments for SAT and CSP. We assume that this can be retrieved by satisfactory interpretation. Definition 15: Let S = (R, 0) be any semiring and T = (L, M, |) a theory."}, {"heading": "Infinite: Factorized", "text": "Despite the universality of the above definition, we would like to address the factored setting for a number of applications (then the most prominent being is the likely conclusion in hybrid graphical models (Belle, Passerini and Van den Broeck 2015). Consider, for example, a common distribution to the probability space R \u00b7 {0, 1}. Here, it is natural to define the weights for each arbitrary variable individually and construct a factored formula for the entire space by product dimensions (Halmos 1950). A second technicality is that in the finite case the set of letters is true on a model by definition. This is no longer the case."}, {"heading": "4 Compositionality", "text": "In this section, we do not attempt to duplicate such efforts, but present a different representation of compositivity, built in the spirit of similar ideas for CSPs (Bistarelli 2004) and motivated by machine learning."}, {"heading": "5 Solver Construction", "text": "This year, more than ever, it is in a position to seek a solution."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "These languages provide mechanisms to compress complex probability processes that relate to prolog with probability distributions, and appeal to sampling for inference.Closely related to such proposals are probabilistic programming languages such as Problog (De Raedt, Kimmig, and Toivonen 2007), which extend prolog with probability distributions, and languages that use WMC for inferencing (Fierens et al. 2011). In particular, a semiring generalization of Problog, called aProbLog (Kimmig, Van den Broeck, and De Raedt 2011), was the starting point for our work and employs a semiring variation of WMC for inferencing (Kimmig, Van den Broeck, De Broeck, and De Raedt)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "In short, SP is a framework for declaring three main concerns in AI applications: \u2022 logical thinking; \u2022 discrete and continuous probabilistic conclusion; \u2022 discrete and continuous optimization. In terms of its strengths, we note that SP is universal (in the above sense) and general (in terms of allowing instances of certain logical languages and fields). Therefore, we believe that SP represents a simple, consistent, modular and transparent approach to the modeling process of complex AI applications. SP brings rigorous semantics to give meaning to its programs. In this sense, we imagine that future developments of SP would follow restrictive programming languages and probabilistic programming languages to provide more complex modeling functions that ultimately draw on the proposed paper semantics."}], "references": [{"title": "Lifting relational map-lps using cluster signatures", "author": ["Kersting Apsel", "U.
