To improve this, we propose an approach to generate abstractive summaries by fusing important content from several utterances. Any meeting is generally comprised of several discussion topic segments. For each topic segment within a meeting conversation, we aim to generate a one sentence summary from the most important utterances using an integer linear programming-based sentence fusion approach. Experimental results show that our method can generate more informative summaries than the baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 15:53:04 GMT  (802kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07035v1", "WWW '15 Companion Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, Pages 5-6. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1609.07033"]], "COMMENTS": "WWW '15 Companion Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, Pages 5-6. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1609.07033", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["siddhartha banerjee", "prasenjit mitra", "kazunari sugiyama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07035"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.07035.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Abstractive Meeting Summarization Using Dependency Graph Fusion", "authors": ["Siddhartha Banerjee", "Prasenjit Mitra", "Kazunari Sugiyama"], "emails": ["sub253@ist.psu.edu", "pmitra@qf.org.qa", "sugiyama@comp.nus.edu.sg"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Categories and Theme Descriptions I.2.7 [Artificial Intelligence]: Natural Language Processing - Language GenerationKeywords Abstract of Abstract Meetings; Integer Linear Programming"}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "A recent study found that people generally prefer abstract summaries. Table 1 shows that people classify these summaries as \"important\" and present them to a reader; it is difficult to read and synthesize information from such statements. On the contrary, human summaries are compact and legible. We propose an automatic way in which these summaries are classified as \"important.\""}, {"heading": "2. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "We need to refer to all the important utterances within the topic segment to generate the best subtree that meets the constraints and maximizes the objective function of the optimization problem.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "The AMI Meeting Corpus contains 20 session minutes in the test set along with the corresponding abstract (human-written) summaries and comments on topic segments. ROUGE serves to compare the content selection of several approaches. We compared the content selection of our approach with an extractive summary [3] that serves as a starting point. We compared our model even without anaphora resolution to see the effects of pronoun resolution. All summaries were compared with the human-made summaries for reference. Results in Table 3 show that our method outperforms the other techniques in both ROUGE-2 (R2) and ROUGE-SU4 (R-SU4). In addition, we calculated a rough estimate of gramaticality based on the log likelihood score (LL) of the parser. Our technique clearly outperforms the extractive method. In future work, we plan to design an end-to-end session summary for the parser."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This material is based on research funded by the National Science Foundation under grant number 0845487."}, {"heading": "4.
