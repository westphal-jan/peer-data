Introduction", "text": "In knowledge representation, it is often necessary to characterize the context associated with a statement, such as when and how it was generated, or who uttered it. However, RDF and OWL can only natively represent binary relations [12]. Many models exist to provide statements about statements, some of which are specific to a particular \"dimension\" of the context, such as temporal validity. Along these lines, Welty and Fikes [17] proposed an ontology to describe flows (i.e. entities whose characteristics change over time) in 2006. Their approach has improved the state of art in temporal representation and has been used and expanded in other works, but it deals only with one dimension that characterizes a statement. Nevertheless, Welty and Fikes's approach can be expanded so that any number of context dimensions can be represented before we present these context dimensions through a generic ontology that can extend to any specific dimension of the context."}, {"heading": "2. 4dFluents Ontology", "text": "Welty and Fikes [17] deal with the problem of representing fluid relations, i.e. relations held within a certain time interval and not in others. They deal with the problem from the perspective of diachronic identity (i.e., how a unit looks different at different times) and show the two different ways of approaching it: \u2022 The permanent (3D) view distinguishes between endurants, endurants that are always present throughout its existence, and perdurants, events that affect an entity during a certain period of time during the entity's existence. \u2022 The permanent (4D) view argues that entities themselves must be treated as permanent, i.e. temporal parts of a four-dimensional meta-entity. Instead of making a claim about some entities, such as \"Paris is the capital of France,\" the assertion about its temporal parts should be considered as fluid: \"A temporary part of Paris (since 508 until now) is the capital part of an entity that has been expressed since the 50s.\""}, {"heading": "3.

While there is nothing to prevent the use of regular data type properties with context-related parts of an entity, it may be desirable to explain explicit axioms for context properties to facilitate arguing about this information. In this case, the statements of Ontology 5 must be added to the NdFluents ontology. Figure 2 shows an example in which a context-related property is used to specify the population of Paris at a certain time interval. Note that it is possible to add specific context-related property subproperties for different context-related dimensions (i.e., temporalProperty for TemportytytPart) for properties associated with specific context dimensions.Prefix (nd: http: / / purl.org / purl.org / ndfluent / ndfluent) properties for different contextual properties."}, {"heading": "3.3.

Relations between Different ContextualParts", "text": "NdFluents ontology is so advanced that it can model relationships between different contextual parts of different contexts (i.e., a temporary part of Paris could be the capital of a provenance part of France). While this may be convenient for individual cases, it is necessary for a contextual property that relates to the same dimension of the context. In this case, it is necessary to add the corresponding axioms to ontology. In Ontology 8 we show the axioms needed to relate this property to the Temporal Parts. Indeed, if there are datatypes that relate to specific dimensions, axioms from Ontology 9 should be adde.Prefix"}, {"heading": "3.5. Adapting Non-Contextual Ontologies to NdFluents", "text": "In the previous sections, we show how to define and use NdFluents to define properties applicable to contextual parts. However, in some cases, we would prefer to reuse existing ontologies. It is not always possible to add a co-ownership relationship between an already defined property and a contextual property, since most of the restrictions do not apply to the contextual parts of an entity. For example, suppose that the property capitalOf Domain City exists and we use it as a flowing property of an entity with the same object, then one would conclude that Paris @ 1 is a city rather than Paris being derived as a city. There might also be a problem if an InverseFunctionalObjectProperty is used in two different contextual parts of an entity with the same object (e.g. Paris @ 508 and Paris @ 2016, both as capital of France), because they would then be traced back to the same entity."}, {"heading": "3.6. Dealing with Terminological Statements", "text": "Generally, contexts are used only for assertions (which is usually referred to as ABox), but there are cases where terminological statements (the TBox) can also be considered under other contextual dimensions. Consider the case of classic biological kingdoms. While in the US it is traditionally assumed that there are six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea / Archaeabacteria and Bacteria / Eubacteria), in many other countries only five are considered (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera). This classification evolved from the historical perspective of animal and plant kingdoms, while newer classifications include up to eight kingdoms. Whether viruses are included in the taxonomy is still an ongoing debate. Such a classification would subclassify relationships such as haloarchaea subclassifications of Archaeabacteria and Haloarchaea subclassifications of Monera, but it is not dependent on the subclassification of them."}, {"heading": "4.

For this task, we use the information modeled by Wikipedia3.We to capture the steps for temporal and provencal dimensions defined in the previous section. In step 4, we select several contexts for each constellation to model the data."}, {"heading": "5. Related work", "text": "This year, the time has come for an agreement to be reached in just a few days."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "We have proposed NdMarie, a multi-domain contextual representation based on the ontology of 4dFluents. To our knowledge, this is the first generic extension of 4dFluents for any number of contextual dimensions. This representation is to be extended in a modular way for any desired contextual dimension in ontology. We have discussed various possible models that can be used in combining different dimensions, possible additions that can be considered depending on the data we want to represent, and open questions of ontology. We have also provided schematic guidelines for the use of NdFluents and a practical example. Both the ontology and the example are published for public use. While NdFluents requires the inclusion of more three-dimensional data and seems less intuitive than any of the alternatives, it allows a more complete OWL inference within a context (with the exceptions presented in the section)."}], "references": [{"title": "Representing temporal knowledge in the semantic web: The extended 4d fluents approach", "author": ["Sotiris Batsakis", "Euripides GM Petrakis"], "venue": "In Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Temporal Representation and Reasoning in OWL", "author": ["Sotiris Batsakisa", "Euripides Petrakisb", "Ilias Tachmazidisa", "Grigoris Antonioua"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Understanding the Semantic Web through Descriptions and Situations", "author": ["Aldo Gangemi", "Peter Mika"], "venue": "In On The Move to Meaningful Internet Systems: CoopIS, DOA, and ODBASE,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2003}, {"title": "A Multi-dimensional Comparison of Ontology Design Patterns for Representing n-ary Relations", "author": ["Aldo Gangemi", "Valentina Presutti"], "venue": "In SOFSEM: Theory and Practice of Computer Science,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Norms and plans as unification criteria for social collectives", "author": ["Aldo Gangemi", "Jos Lehmann", "Carola Catenacci"], "venue": "Normative Multi-agent Systems,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Continuum: a spatiotemporal data model to represent and qualify filiation relationships", "author": ["Benjamin Harbelot", "Helbert Arenas", "Christophe Cruz"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 4th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on GeoStreaming, IWGS,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2013}, {"title": "The spatio-temporal semantics from a perdurantism perspective", "author": ["Benjamin Harbelot", "Helbert Arenas", "Christophe Cruz"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Advanced Geographic Information Systems, Applications, and Services GEOProcessing,", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2013}, {"title": "SWRL: A semantic web rule language combining OWL and RuleML", "author": ["Ian Horrocks", "Peter F.
