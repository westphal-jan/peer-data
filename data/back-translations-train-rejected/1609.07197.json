A textual number is a range of text in x that indicates a numerical quantity. Q (x) is the set of all textual numbers. An embodiment is a pairing (q, c) between a textual number q (x) and a coefficient c (T).A set of alignment effects is a derivative z = (T, A) of an equation system. We use (A, B, C,.) to represent coefficients and (m, n) to represent the unknown variables in the templates. We assume that there is a routine solution."}, {"heading": "3 Annotating Derivations", "text": "Since none of the existing benchmarks contain derivative comments, we have decided to add these notes to existing data sets. We have also created DRAW-1K, a new dataset of 1,000 generic algebra word problems to make our study more comprehensible. Noting gold derivatives from the ground up for all problems is time consuming. However, any word problems do not require manual annotation, as sometimes a number that appears in an equation can be clearly aligned with a textual number. We first identify word problems that have ambiguity for alignments - problems that have multiple textual numbers with the same value that appears in the equation system."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Setup", "text": "The ALG-514 dataset was introduced in (Kushman et al., 2014). It consists of problems searched by algebra.com, spanning a variety of narrative scenarios (distance velocity, object counting, simple interest, etc.).DOLPHIN-L is the linear T2 subset of the DOLPHIN dataset (Shi et al., 2015). DOLPHIN focuses on a specific type of algebra word problem, such as number word problems that describe mathematical relationships directly in the text. In this paper, we present Various Algebra Word (DRAW1K), a new dataset consisting of 1000 word problems searched by algebra. com. Details on how to create the datasets can be found in the appendix.We use 5-fold cross-validation splits provided by the authors for PHOLIN-5G and PHOLG-5G-14."}, {"heading": "4.1 Evaluation", "text": "We compare the following evaluation metrics. Derivative Accuracy A derivative is correct if the submission of the predicted derivative corresponds to the submission of the reference derivative and the set of adjusted text numbers corresponds to the derivative of the reference solution as defined in Section 2.Solution Accuracy. After previous work (Kushman et al., 2014), we calculate the accuracy of the solution by checking whether every number in the reference solution appears in the generated solution (without considering the sequence) Equation Accuracy An approximation of the derivative accuracy used in Kushman et al. (2014). A reference derivative z is randomly selected from the set of derivatives from which the gold y is formed from x. Derivative Accuracy is calculated from this reference derivative. Without human correction, the derivative accuracy may be incorrect as multiple derivatives may lead to the same y."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we propose algorithms for evaluating and annotating derivatives of word problems and have introduced a new dataset, DRAW-1K. We have also added derivative annotations to existing benchmarks to facilitate future comparisons. We have found that derivative accuracy is a more accurate assessment of solvers \"ability to understand the context of natural language, compared to solving or equation accuracy. We also believe that the derivative annotation dataset may have new uses that go beyond current intentions. For example, the derivative annotation also enables training systems to create partial equation systems with incomplete word problems. We hope that the dataset will open up new opportunities for the community to simulate new ideas and applications for automatic problem solvers."}], "references": [{"title": "A questionanswering system for high school algebra word problems", "author": ["Daniel G.
