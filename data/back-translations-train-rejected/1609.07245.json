Introduction", "text": "This year it has come to the point where it will be able to take the lead, \"he said in an interview with the German Press Agency.\" We have never lost as much time as this year, \"he said.\" But we are not yet to the point where we will be able to retaliate, \"he said."}, {"heading": "2. The property of \u201cconsistent standard deviation coefficient\u201d for amplitude spectrum of unvoiced pronunciation", "text": "For unspoken pronunciations on the timeline, the individual pronunciations in such data are too short for current studies. As the results of each discrete frequency component are considered a random variable due to the randomness of the signal. For each discrete frequency component, the statistics of the short-term amplitude spectrum are examined by estimating the expectation and standard deviation as two basic statistics. Furthermore, a novel stochastic property is revealed about the relationship between these two basic statistics for unspoken pronunciation. Since large amounts of data are required for this statistical study, the signals collected and used in this work are considered two basic pronunciations, not the words or phrases in daily communication. In another word, the study focuses on signal randomness at the level of individual unspoken phonemes, which differs from most previous research. Although well-organized corpses such as TIMIT have the detailed words, syllables or even phonemes on the timeline, the individual pronunciations are too short for such studies."}, {"heading": "3. The probability distribution model of the short-time amplitude spectrum for unvoiced pronunciation", "text": "In addition to the basic statistics mentioned in Section 2, the histogram of the amplitude value for each frequency component is also calculated using a tuning method that practically corresponds to the estimation of the amplitude probability distribution. Subsequently, a model is proposed that describes the relationship between amplitude distributions of different frequency components in voiceless pronunciation, which corresponds well to the property of \"consistent standard deviation coefficient.\" And the pdf of the expected normalized amplitude is quantitatively equipped with the Weibull distribution."}, {"heading": "3.1 Amplitude histogram computation as the estimation of probability distribution", "text": "For each frequency component, the following steps are performed: Step 1: Determine an appropriate range of amplitude values for that frequency component. Step 3: In the spectrum of each frame, the amplitude value of the current frequency component should be included, then find the bin in which that amplitude value falls, and increase the number of these intervals by one. In other words, allow the frequency values of a frequency component to fall into each of them. After the above selection process, the amplitude histogram can be divided by the total number of data exceeding the estimated probability of falling into each interval by dividing the matching results."}, {"heading": "4. The stochastic model for the short-time spectrum of unvoiced pronunciation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 The estimation of phase distribution for unvoiced pronunciation", "text": "The spectral value is usually a complex number whose module represents the amplitude and the argument represents the phase. In addition to the amplitude, this paper also examines the phase distribution to allow for continuous voiceless pronunciation.The similar method is used to estimate the probability distribution of the phase as in Section 3.1, except that the range of the phase value is defined as [-\u03c0, \u03c0], such a range is uniformly divided into intervals of equal length. Phase distribution is estimated for each frequency component.For each phase interval, the number of phase data falling therein is counted, and such an estimate can be made to obtain a phase distribution curve.Some of the results are shown in Figure 12 for the pronunciation of [h], [s], voiceless [a] and voiceless [e].The experimental results indicate a uniform distribution of the phase spectrum, as demonstrated by communication models, and as many have demonstrated."}, {"heading": "4.2 The model of short-time amplitude and phase spectrum of unvoiced pronunciation", "text": "By combining the model of amplitude distribution proposed in section 3 pdf with the phase distribution in section 4.1, a stochastic model can be proposed for the short-term spectrum of voiceless pronunciation: (1) The short-term spectrum of voiceless pronunciation is random; for each frequency component, its amplitude can be modelled as Weibull distribution; its phase can be modelled as uniform distribution in the range of [-\u03c0, \u03c0]. (2) In addition, the standard deviation coefficient of amplitude is uniform for all frequency components; in other words, for each frequency component of a specific voiceless pronunciation, the standard deviation of its amplitude is proportional to expectation. (3) For a specific voiceless pronunciation, all frequency components are consistent for the frequency distribution a0, with a0 being the prototype of the random variable of the Weibull distribution."}, {"heading": "5. Synthesis of unvoiced pronunciation based on the proposed stochastic model", "text": "In this section, the signal of the continuous voiceless pronunciation is synthesized on the basis of the proposed stochastic model of the short-term spectrum. The purpose of the synthesis here has two aspects. The first step is to generate a synthetic signal with the same perceptual quality as the original pronunciation as possible. The second step is to verify the proposed stochastic model experimentally. Since the short-term data obtained in the experiments are obtained by STFT, based on the stochastic model proposed above, it is possible to generate arbitrary short-term spectral data based on which the synthesis of the voiceless pronunciation by the reverse STFT.There are three steps for the proposed synthesis: The first step is a model parameter estimation from the original signal of the voiceless pronunciation. The main parameters of the proposed model in section 4.2 are the average amplitude value for each frequency."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "This paper examines the stochastic property of the short-term spectrum of unspoken pronunciation. Based on the signals of persistent unspoken pronunciation, the relationship between the expectation of the amplitude and the standard deviation for different frequency components is examined in the short-term spectrum obtained from STFT. In the experiments, the ratio of the standard deviation to the expectation (also called the standard deviation coefficient) is considered consistent for all frequency components. Such a novel property is related to the physical aeroacoustic process of unspoken pronunciation.Based on such a phenomenon of the \"consistent standard deviation coefficient,\" a stochastic model of the amplitude spectrum is proposed in which all frequency components share a common prototype of the pdf for the value of the amplitude spectrum."}], "references": [{"title": "Log-spectral amplitude estimation with Generalized Gamma distributions for speech enhancement", "author": ["J.
