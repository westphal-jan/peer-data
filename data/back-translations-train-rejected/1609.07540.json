For time series modeling, most existing works make some unrealistic assumptions such as the input data is of fixed length or well aligned, which requires extra effort on segmentation or normalization of the raw streaming data. Although some literature claim their approaches to be invariant to data length and misalignment, they are too time-consuming to model a streaming time series in an online manner. We propose a novel and more practical online modeling and classification scheme, DDE-MGM, which does not make any assumptions on the time series while maintaining high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. The derivative delay embedding (DDE) is developed to incrementally transform time series to the embedding space, where the intrinsic characteristics of data is preserved as recursive patterns regardless of the stream length and misalignment. Then, a non-parametric Markov geographic model (MGM) is proposed to both model and classify the pattern in an online manner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior classification accuracy of the proposed DDE-MGM in an online setting as compared to the state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 00:03:49 GMT  (1839kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07540v1", "Accepted by The 25th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by The 25th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zhifei zhang", "yang song", "wei wang", "hairong qi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07540"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.07540.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Derivative Delay Embedding: Online Modeling of Streaming Time Series", "authors": ["Zhifei Zhang", "Yang Song", "Wei Wang", "Hairong Qi"], "emails": ["zzhang61@vols.utk.edu", "ysong18@vols.utk.edu", "wwang@vols.utk.edu", "hqi@utk.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Tags Delay Embedding; Streaming Time Series; Online Modelling and Classification; Markov Geographical ModelSource: https: / / github.com / ZZUTK / Delay Embedding.git"}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "There has been an unprecedented increase in interest in streaming time series modeling and classification, mainly due to the rapid deployment of smart devices. Traditionally, time series classification has been performed using an offline training process coupled with an online / offline classification process. During the training process, some pre-processing steps are normally performed, including segmentation of time series into finite (usually specified) length and alignment of segments to facilitate subsequent functional extraction, which usually produces discriminatory patterns for classification purposes. However, with the explosion of the smart device and the associated jump in traffic, new challenges in time series analysis arise. For example, time series data typically exhibit time-varying features over an, in theory, infinite time span, so the time series is manually shortened to fixed length, well-aligned segments run the risk of requiring some intrinsic characteristics of the classification side to many of the fictional responses."}, {"heading": "1.1 Motivation", "text": "The theory of deceleration embedding [24, 22] was first introduced to reconstruct a chaotic dynamic system from a sequence of observations of the system.The reconstruction preserves the coordinate and period changes of the dynamic system, but it is invariant against phase changes (i.e. misalignment).Another advantage of deceleration embedding is its low computational complexity, such as O (1).In addition, the reconstruction is performed step by step, which facilitates online processing, since only more recent observations are taken into account when the dynamic system is reconstructed from a flowing time series.The reconstructed dynamic system is usually presented in a higher dimensional space, in which the dynamics exhibit recursive patterns [8, 18, 9] regardless of the length of the dynamic time series, which is altered by a potentially finite time shift."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related Work", "text": "The dynamic pastime (DTW) method [2] has achieved good performance in the time series classification, especially in the time from 1: 1 to 2: 2.

For example, the zero drift effect will cause the sensor output to drift even though the external environment has not changed at all; or different types of sensors monitoring the same variable may yield results in different baselines. Furthermore, embedding the room requires continuous space, so the exact position of the states / trajectory would consume large storage capacities. To address these two issues, we are developing the Derived Embedding Delay (DDE) method, which uses the observation function (xt) = y \u00b2 t to shift the baseline shift, and then discredit embedding the room into a grid to reduce storage costs."}, {"heading": "2.3 Parameter Selection", "text": "There are two parameters in the delay, i.e., the delay stage s and the embedding dimension d. empirical studies show that d and s both significantly influence the performance of embedding in the aspect of classification accuracy, and they are application-oriented, varying with different datasets. In DDE we have an additional parameter - the cell size of the discredited embedding space, which determines the accuracy of the representation of state development. This section discusses the methods of selecting suitable values for s, d, and the grid size.2.1 Delay Step (s) According to [17], an effective method of observing the optimal s is to minimize the mutual information between yt and yt + s. The idea is to ensure a sufficiently large quantity so that the information measured at t + s differs significantly from the time."}, {"heading": "3. MARKOV GEOGRAPHIC MODEL", "text": "As discussed in the DDE, the trajectory constructed from a time series will preserve distinct and robust patterns. Therefore, we can model the trajectories of different classes during training, and then the label of a test time series could be decided by comparison with the trajectories learned. However, many existing work related to the delay of embedding would model the trajectories through a group of differential functions, parametric models, or topological features [18], such as barcodes from persistent homology. However, they all perform in one way, and it is difficult to find a parametric model that is suitable for all applications. We propose a non-parametric model MGM that could model the trajectories in an online maneuver.From Fig. 1, we can see that the trajectory and geographical location of states both carry significant information that distinguish one pattern from another."}, {"heading": "4. ONLINE MODELING", "text": "Figure 7 shows the sequence of the DDE-MGM scheme, assuming for simplicity d = 2 and s = 1. In online modeling, a training time series flows through a buffer of size (d \u2212 1) s + 1 = 2. When a new data point arrives, the oldest one is removed from the buffer, and only the data points in the buffer are applied to DDE to construct a state in the discredited embedding space. State location and transition from the previous state are updated in the corresponding MGM."}, {"heading": "4.1 Representing MGM", "text": "For example, in a discretized embedding space of 50 x 50 raster, the geographic distribution requires 502 bytes to record the number of states falling into each cell (| \u03a6 \u2032 (xt) | in Eq.10). For the transition probability, it is a common method to capture all possible transitions, to construct a (50 x 50) 2 matrix that is huge and a waste of memory. As such a matrix is usually sparse, we use a \"list\" to accumulate only these active transitions (| \u03a6 \u2032 (xt); \u03a6 \u2032 (xt \u2212 1) | in Eq.11). Note that each class maintains its own MGM. The modeling process transforms the time series and updates MGMs in real time without any pre-processing or assumptions about the time series. During the classification, a test stream is also transformed into the embedding space where Eq.12 can be applied to calculate the similarity between each class S \u00b7 S (M) and each S = S (M) step by step."}, {"heading": "4.2 Neighborhood Matching", "text": "In practice, an audit trail cannot perfectly coincide with an MGM.

For time series modeling, most existing works make some unrealistic assumptions such as the input data is of fixed length or well aligned, which requires extra effort on segmentation or normalization of the raw streaming data. Although some literature claim their approaches to be invariant to data length and misalignment, they are too time-consuming to model a streaming time series in an online manner. We propose a novel and more practical online modeling and classification scheme, DDE-MGM, which does not make any assumptions on the time series while maintaining high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. The derivative delay embedding (DDE) is developed to incrementally transform time series to the embedding space, where the intrinsic characteristics of data is preserved as recursive patterns regardless of the stream length and misalignment. Then, a non-parametric Markov geographic model (MGM) is proposed to both model and classify the pattern in an online manner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior classification accuracy of the proposed DDE-MGM in an online setting as compared to the stateof-the-art.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
