Based on authentic language data of English, the present study calculated the entropy and other entropy-related statistics for different sentence positions. The statistics indicate a three-step staircase-shaped distribution pattern, with entropy in the initial position lower than the medial positions (positions other than the initial and final), the medial positions lower than the final position and the medial positions showing no significant difference. The results suggest that: (1) the hypotheses of Constant Entropy Rate and Uniform Information Density do not hold for the sentence-medial positions; (2) the context of a word in a sentence should not be simply defined as all the words preceding it in the same sentence; and (3) the contextual information content in a sentence does not accumulate incrementally but follows a pattern of \"the whole is greater than the sum of parts\".", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 23:36:31 GMT  (407kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07681v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shuiyuan yu", "jin cong", "junying liang", "haitao liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07681"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.07681.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The distribution of information content in English sentences", "authors": ["Shuiyuan Yu", "Jin Cong", "Junying Liang", "Haitao Liu"], "emails": ["htliu@163.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to move to another world in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able to move, in which they are able, and in which they are able to move."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to assert themselves, that they are able to assert themselves, that they are able to assert themselves, and that they are able to assert themselves, and that they are able, are able to assert themselves, and that they are able, are able, are able to assert themselves."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to orient themselves in a certain direction in which they are able to."}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "The data used in the current study are part of the British National Corpus (BNC) (34), with 17,293 texts.
