(2012), who has built a statistical transfer system for translating from Arabic into Hebrew and vice versa. Their work relies on synchronous contexts, free grammars, and lexicographs in the two languages, an approach they consider more appropriate for two reasons: (a) a lack of available parallel corpora; and (b) the rich morphology of Arabic and Hebrew that requires linguistic knowledge. Here, we explore an alternative to this approach by exploiting parallel Arabic-Hebrew texts that have recently become available, and allowing us to train standard statistical systems."}, {"heading": "3 Linguistic Description", "text": "Here we give a brief description of the similarities and differences between Arabic and Hebrew, which refer to (Shilon et al., 2012) for extensive discussion. As Semitic languages, Arabic and Hebrew have several characteristics. In both orthographies, vowels and other diacritical scripts are often omitted, leading to increased ambiguity. Scriptures are different, but there is significant overlap in the alphabets. Many clicks (prepositions, conjunctions, certain articles) are preceded or associated with words. Both languages have a rich morphology with a complex system of verbal inflection, their bending paradigms partially overlap, but not completely. Syntactically, the languages have both verbal and pale sentences. Arabic in particular has a more complicated system of compatibility. Some systematic word order patterns can be determined (SVO for Hebrew, VSO for Arabic), but these have exceptions and are from generic Shreal on this more complex system of compatibility."}, {"heading": "4 Parallel Corpora", "text": "Until recently, there were not many available parallel corpus of Arabic and Hebrew. Shilon et al. (2012) prepared a parallel corpus of several hundred sentences from the news field, too small to form a statistical system, but potentially useful for evaluation. Since then, two major resources have been available. First, WIT3 provides multilingual transcriptions of TED conversations (Cettolo et al., 2012) and its 2016 publication comprises approximately 3 million words of Arabic-Hebrew parallel texts (Cettolo, 2016). As a corpus of TED conversations, it has several interesting features: variety of topics, spoken transcriptions, and user-generated translations, although the review process ensures adequate translation quality. The original transcriptions are segmented at the level of the caption and WIT3 automatically merges them into sentences. Second, OPUS offers a collection of Hebrew translation texts, Hebrew translations and full-text translations."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Setup", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Machine Translation Systems", "text": "Phrase-based MT We build a standardized PBMT system with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). Word alignment is done by fast alignment (Dyer et al., 2013) and symmetrized with the growth diag final-and-strategy, and the lexical alignment follows the msd-bidirectional-fe configuration. Sentences longer than 80 words are filtered during the training. We train a 5 gram language model on the training target side with KenLM (Heafield et al., 2013) and coordinate with MERT to optimize BLEU. These are common Moses settings that were also used in the Arabic-English translation (Almahairi et al., 2016). Neural MT We train a neural translation system using a Torch (Collobert et al., 2011)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Tokenization and Sub-Word Models", "text": "Morphological processing and tokenization are considered critical for machine translation from and into Semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew (Section 2), which is typically used as a pre-processing step and requires language-specific tools. An alternative option is the inclusion of language-agnostic subword elements in the training algorithm. We describe the two options below. Tokenization We are experimenting with tokenizing the Arabic source page with two tools: MADAMIRA (Pasha et al., 2014), a standard morphological analyzer and disambiguator, and the Farasa segmentator (Abdelali et al., 2016), a much faster ranker that has proven to be comparable to MADAMIRA. In both cases, we segment Arabic according to the ATB scheme, which tends to achieve better results than other schemes in translation between Arabic and English (El Kholy et al, 2012 al; jal al al)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Data and Evaluation", "text": "We are mainly experimenting with the WIT3 corpus of TED talks (Section 4). It is a relatively large corpus (3 million words), with high-quality translations and diverse topics. We are using the designated train.tags files for training, IWSLT16.TED.tst2010-2014 for tuning, and IWSLT16.TED.dev2010 for testing. We are keeping IWSLT16.TED.tst2015-2016 as a manageable set for future evaluations. Table 2 provides some statistics on the data sets. We are also conducting initial separate experiments with the OpenSubtitles corpus. However, the translation quality was very poor, mainly due to the extremely noisy nature of the data set. Therefore, we are leaving the research of this corpus to future work. We are calculating BLEU scores using the Multibleu and Perl script that is included with Moses. Significance tests follow (KoehEU, 2004; Riezwell Resources) and Riezwell (We are also using the BLEU BMT)."}, {"heading": "6 Results", "text": "Table 3 summarizes the results for the Arabic-Hebrew translation on the WIT3 corpus of the TED conversations. As expected, tokenization helps with phrase-based MT, although the differences in BLEU values are not statistically significant. In terms of BLEU, neural MT performs significantly better than phrase-based MT, and the use of char-based models leads to significant and statistically significant improvements. Another small improvement is achieved by replacing generated unknown words with translations of their aligned source words based on attention weights (Jean et al., 2015). Using a larger and deeper NMT model does not result in significant improvements, possibly due to the size of the training data.We note that the generally low BLEU values are due to the single reference rating mode, as well as to the challenging nature of the data (spoken language scripts, automatically aligned topics in Arabic MT) used in previous BLEU translations and MT translations."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We also examined the contribution of tokenization to the PBMT system and character-level models to the NMT system. This work is a first step that can be extended in many ways. First, experimentation with the Hebrew-Arabic direction could bring new insights to light. Second, other combinations of tokenization and character-level models can be explored (e.g. character-level neural models on tokenized or bytepair-encoded text). Also, parallel corpora can be cleaned up and improved, especially by adding multiple reference translations. Finally, modeling relationships between the two languages in a more direct way is an attractive direction given the similarities at different linguistic levels."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank Mauro Cettolo for his useful suggestions regarding the Arabic-Hebrew TED conversation corpus, Pierre Lison and Jo \ufffd rg Tiedemann for their help in accessing the OpenSubtitles corpus, and Reshef Shilon for their fruitful discussions, which were supported by the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI).
