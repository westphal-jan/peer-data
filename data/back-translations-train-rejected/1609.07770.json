In this study, we have an approach to converting a malware into an image and using malware families. The resulting accuracy of 0.9562 shows the effectiveness of the method for detecting malware. MachineLearning; Random Forest; I, the cybercrime through networked computer systems, remains a growing threat to developed regions with a mature infrastructure (ICT) in which a significant number of public and private services depend. At the heart of malware operations are malware, bots, trojans and viruses."}, {"heading": "A. Data Preparation", "text": "The resulting 8-bit vectors are then displayed as a grayscale image, as in Fig. 1. The conversion result of the malware binary files consists of images with different sizes and patterns as in Fig. 2. It is also worth noting that several malware creators add additional binary code patterns to their malware as a personal signature, such as the lower part of the image shown in Fig. 2. The malware images are resized in a two-dimensional matrix to have a uniform dataset. The resized images are rendered to n x n array with n = 32. Each resulting array of 1024 length is labeled with the corresponding malware family.The labeled arrays are merged into a csv file that would include the training set for the machine learning algorithm."}, {"heading": "B. Classification", "text": "Various research on malware and detection of cyber anomalies used machine learning methods for this study, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and Neural Networks (NN) [6], using Random Forest as a viable method of classifying malware. In terms of monitored learning and performance, several studies have classified Gradient Boosted Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines as highly predictive precision [7] [8]. While Gradient Boosted Trees had the highest precision, Random Forest achieved almost the same performance with minimal parameter setting [7]. In this study, we used Random Forest implementation on R with the RandomForest and Caret Library."}, {"heading": "C.
