The SP system has the generality needed for CSRK: Turing equivalence; the generality of information compression as the foundation for the SP system both in the representation of knowledge and in concepts of prediction and probability; the versatility of the SP system in the representation of knowledge and in aspects of intelligence including forms of reasoning; and the potential of the system for the seamless integration of diverse forms of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence. Several examples discussed by DM, and how they may be processed in the SP system, are discussed. Also discussed are current successes in CSR (taxonomic reasoning, temporal reasoning, action and change, and qualitative reasoning), how the SP system may promote seamless integration across these areas, and how insights gained from the SP programme of research may yield some potentially useful new ways of approaching these topics. The paper considers how the SP system may help overcome several challenges in the automation of CSR described by DM, and how it meets several of the objectives for research in CSRK that they have described.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Sep 2016 16:48:16 GMT  (34kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07772v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j gerard wolff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07772"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.07772.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Commonsense reasoning, commonsense knowledge, and the SP theory of intelligence", "authors": ["J Gerard Wolff"], "emails": ["jgw@cognitionresearch.org;"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Dr Gerry Wolff, BA (Cantab), PhD (Wales), CEng, MBCS, MIEEE; CognitionResearch.org, Menai Bridge, UK; jgw @ cognitionresearch.org; + 44 (0) 1248 712962; + 44 (0) 7746 290775; Skype: gerry.wolff; Web: www.cognitionresearch.org.1ar Xiv: 160 9.07 772v 1 [cs.A I] 2 5Se p"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "So say Ernest Davis and Gary Marcus [5, p. 92], who illustrate the point with questions that are easy for humans to answer but can be difficult for artificial systems, such as \"Who is taller, Prince William or his son?\" and \"Can you make a salad from a polyester shirt?\" (ibid.)

As mentioned in Appendix A. It is provided that all kinds of knowledge in the SP system are represented with SP patterns, which means arrays of atomic symbols in one or two dimensions. Despite their simplicity, SP patterns have been shown to be effective within the multidimensional alignment framework when it comes to representing multiple forms of knowledge, each of which can serve in the CSC, including: the syntax of natural language; class hierarchies, class heterarchies (i.e. class hierarchies with cross-division); partial whole hierarchies; discrimination networks and trees; entity relationship structures; relational knowledge; rules for the use in the argumentation; in one pattern; in one dimension; or in two dimensions; and [in detail] three; and in two dimensions."}, {"heading": "4 Versatility in aspects of intelligence", "text": "Despite the basic simplicity of the SP system, it shows strengths and potential in several aspects of intelligence, including: unattended learning; natural language processing; blurred pattern recognition; multi-level recognition; best-match and semantic forms of information gathering; different ways of thinking (more in Section 5, below); planning and problem solving ([14, chapters 5 to 9], [15, section 10])."}, {"heading": "4.1 Pattern recognition with class-inclusion relations, part-", "text": "It also turns out that a very useful and widespread form of inference, which is an outstanding feature of CSR (more below).For the creation of this multiple alignment, the SP computer model was provided with a series of new patterns, which are shown in column 0 of the figure.

This kind of conclusion, which is called \"inheritance of attributes\" in object-oriented programming, 4 and refers to \"prediction by partial alignment\" in information compression, 5, means predicting the invisible parts of a pattern that has been detected, or a number of such patterns. With recognition by multiple alignment, this can happen at all levels of multiple alignment, with the exception of column 0. Thus, for example, in the multiple alignment in Figure 1, we can conclude that the plant has Ranunculus acris chalices that are not reflected, and leaves that are composed and cut palmat (the \"species plane\" in column 1) that the plant is nourished by photosynthesis."}, {"heading": "5 Versatility in reasoning", "text": "Although reasoning is an aspect of intelligence (Section 4), due to the versatility of the SP system in this area and because it is a key component of CSR, the strengths and potentials of the SP system include ([14, Chapter 7], [15, Section 10]): \"deductive\" thinking in one step; reasoning chains; deductive thinking; arguing with probabilistic networks and trees; arguing with \"rules\"; non-monotonous thinking and arguing with default values; Bayesian thinking with \"clearing the way\" (as discussed by Judea Pearl in [9, Sections 1.2.2 and 2.2.4]); causal thinking; and arguing that is not supported by evidence. As we have seen in Section 4.2 or Section 4.2, the SP system also supports conclusions by inheriting attributes.

But, if we are later told that Tweety is a penguin, we will rethink our thinking and almost certainly come to the conclusion that Tweety cannot fly. This is contrary to the classical logic in which later evidence should not change an earlier conclusion - but it is completely consistent with everyday thinking and CSR. With an appropriate memory of old patterns, and the new pattern \"Tweety\" (which can be interpreted as \"Tweety is a bird\"), the best of the multiple alignments generated by the SP computer model is that shown in Figure 2 ([15, Section 10.1], Section 7.7] that the new pattern is \"corresponding to Tweety.\""}, {"heading": "5.2 Spatial reasoning", "text": "As mentioned in Appendix A, it is provided that knowledge in the SP system can be represented with two-dimensional patterns and 1D patterns, and that the SP computer model is generalized to work with 2D patterns, which should facilitate, among other things, the learning of 3D structures and the application of such structures in spatial thinking. In terms of learning 3D structures, the SP system can create a 3D model of an object or another structure by assembling partially overlapping images of the structure taken from different angles, as schematically illustrated in Figure 4. The process of recognizing partial similarities between images would be done by searching for good complete and partial similarities between patterns, a process that is central to the functioning of the SP system [16, Sections 6.1 and 6.2]. The creation of a 3D digital model of an object of an object from overlapping images is already performed by commercially available systems, using a quadrilateral form, and Google view to create a quadrilateral image in the form of a quadrilateral application."}, {"heading": "6 Seamless integration of diverse forms of knowl-", "text": "Edge and various aspects of intelligence (a form of reasoning) are closely linked, which, in effect, should be a kind of natural intelligence.For understanding, it is helpful to simplify different types of intelligence and seamlessly integrate various aspects of intelligence (including multiple forms of reasoning): \u2022 The adoption of a single simple format for all types of knowledge (Section 3) and several aspects of intelligence (Section 4, with multiple forms of reasoning) are central. \u2022 That the relatively simple format for knowledge and the multiple orientation framework for processing knowledge provides for the representation of several different types of knowledge (Section 5).In a relatively simple form, these two types of integration can be seen in the example discussed in Section 4.1, Figure 1: \u2022 Class inclusion relationships and sub-relationships work together in the combination in the representation of knowledge without awkward incompatibilities. \u2022 Pattern recognition (an aspect of general intelligence) and inheritance of attributes (a form of reasoning) are closely linked."}, {"heading": "7 Father and son, and other examples", "text": "This and the following main sections discuss aspects of the CSRC in light of what was said about the SP system earlier in this paper and in Appendix A.

[14] The councillors refused permission to the demonstrators because they were in favour of the revolution. Of course, people assume that in the first sentence \"they\" means the councillors, while in the second sentence \"they\" means the demonstrators, but these two conclusions can be problematic for the AI systems. As with the examples in Section 7, a complete interpretation of such sentences is outside the framework of the SP computer model in its present form. However, as before, the key to interpreting these sentences seems to be the inheritance of attributes as discussed in Sections 7 and 4.1. It is well known that councillors as a class usually want to maintain peace in their city, while a subgroup of the above-mentioned \"supporters\" inherit knowledge of the importance of the revolution. \""}, {"heading": "8.2 Computer vision", "text": "Referring to a photograph of a kitchen shown in [5, Figure 1], DM says: \"Many of the objects that can be seen small or partially, such as the metal shells on the shelf on the left, the cold water button for the faucet, the round metal buttons on the cabinets, the dishwasher and the chairs at the table seen from the side, are only recognizable in context; the isolated image would be difficult to identify.\" (ibid.) (p. 94). It goes on to say: \"The viewer excludes the existence of objects that are not in the picture at all.\" (ibid.) and that \"the viewer also understands how the objects can be used (sometimes referred to as their\" affordances \").\" (ibid.) As described in the next two subsections, these capabilities appear to be well within the scope of the SP system. (ibid.) (8.2.1) While the meaning of the context in the recognition is not the same as the visual recognition and scene analysis, \"it appears that the second part of the 16 is very applicable to the first part of the two principles."}, {"heading": "8.2.2 \u2018Seeing\u2019 things that are not objectively present in an image", "text": "The SP computer model describes some types of situations in which people \"see\" things that are not objectively present in an image: \u2022 Just as we can conclude in the detection example discussed in Section 4.1 that the unknown plant has features that are not contained in the New Information supplied to the SP computer model (cups that are not reflected, leaves that are composed and cut by hand, that the plant nourishes itself through photosynthesis and that it is poisonous), we can derive objects that are not contained in an image and use them for an object that is also not visible. \u2022 David Marr [7] describes two examples in which people \"see\" things that are not objectively present in an image: the sides of a triangle that can be seen in Kanizsa's triangle, although it is mostly empty space (ibid., Figure 2-6); and the line in a photo of a plant in which another leaf overlaps, we can see."}, {"heading": "8.3 Robotic manipulation", "text": "Although the SP concepts, as described in [17], seem to be highly relevant to the development of robot intelligence, no attempt has been made so far to address problems that DM describes as follows: 16 \"When a cat runs in front of a housecleaning robot, the robot should not run it over, nor clean it up, or put it on a shelf. These things seem obvious, but ensuring that a robot avoids mistakes of this kind is a major challenge.\" [5, p. 94] However, it seems likely that the strengths and potential of the SP system in various forms of argumentation (Section 5, [17, Section IV-F]) will help it avoid the errors outlined by DM."}, {"heading": "9 Successes in automated commonsense reason-", "text": "ingThis section looks at four areas where, as described by DM, there has been success with other approaches and compares them with what can be done with the SP system."}, {"heading": "9.1 Taxonomic reasoning", "text": "As we have seen in Section 4.1, taxonomic relationships can be expressed with SP patterns, with pattern recognition at multiple levels of abstraction."}, {"heading": "9.1.1 Basic relations", "text": "With regard to the three basic taxonomic relationships described by DM: \u2022 An individual is a case of a category. This can be seen by the fact that the unknown plant in the example shown in Figure 1 can be identified as an example of the species Meadow Buttercup, a member of the genus Ranunculus, a member of the family Ranunculaceae, etc. \u2022 One category is a subset of another. In the SP system, this type of relationship is expressed by pairs of symbols such as \"< genus >... < / genus >,\" which in the figure indicate the connection between the pattern describing the term \"genus\" (column 6 in the figure) and the pattern describing the term \"species\" (column 1). \u2022 Two categories are separated from each other. In the SP system, this type of relationship can be implicit in a collection of SP patterns."}, {"heading": "9.1.2 Categories and properties", "text": "In this context, an important feature of the SP system is that there is no distinction between categories and properties (also known as classes and attributes), and similarly there is no distinction between \"classes\" and \"objects,\" a distinction that plays a prominent role in object-oriented programming. In the SP system, all such concepts are modeled with \"patterns\" and \"symbols,\" although concepts such as \"category\" and \"property\" can be used informally where appropriate. There are three main advantages in eliminating these distinctions: \u2022 It facilitates the seamless integration of class relations with sub-relationships, as illustrated in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "9.1.3 Forms of inference", "text": "With regard to the taxonomic forms of conclusion discussed by DM: \u2022 transitivity. \"Since lassie is an instance of dog and dog, it follows that lassie is an instance of mammals.\" [5, p. 95] In the SP system, relationships like this can be implicit in a series of patterns that describe different categories of animals; they would not be explicitly encrypted. \u2022 standard inheritance. \"One variant of [inheritance] is standard inheritance; a category can be marked with a characteristic but not universal property, and a subcategory or instance will inherit ownership unless it is explicitly repealed.\" (ibid.) As in Section 5.1, the SP system can model reasoning with standard assumptions. 7When I have been used in the software industry and am working on developing a \"support environment\" for software developers, it becomes clear that it goes as far as integrating classes or sub-products with software products and sub-products."}, {"heading": "9.2 Temporal reasoning", "text": "DM writes: \"For example, if one knows that Mozart was born earlier and died younger than Beethoven, one can conclude that Mozart died earlier than Beethoven.... The integration of such considerations into specific applications, such as the interpretation of natural language, was... problematic.... Many important temporal relationships are not explicitly stated in texts, they are derived, and the process of concluding them can be difficult.\" [5, p. 96] No attempt has been made to apply the SP system to temporal considerations, so the remarks here are tentative. As we have seen in Section 5.2, the SP system has potential for creating 3D digital models of objects and environments and for spatial considerations with such models. The suggestion here, partly motivated by what people seem to be doing in the argument about temporal relations, is that such an argument is made in a manner similar to the problem or the same problem as spatial reasoning, by directly manipulating the temporal description of objects."}, {"heading": "9.3 Action, change, and qualitative reasoning", "text": "DM describe two other areas of success of automated common sense reasoning [5, pp. 96-97]: \u2022 Action and Change. Modeling of subsequent processes related to actions, events, and changes with possibly oversimplified assumptions such as... \"an event occurs at a time, and the rational person only needs to consider the state of the world at the beginning and end of the event...\" and \"Any change in the world is the result of an event.\" \u2022 Qualitative reasoning. Modeling forms of qualitative reasoning such as how the price of a product affects the number of goods sold and how a rise in the temperature of a gas in a closed container leads to an increase in pressure.

This is the kind of fragmentation in AI that Pamela McCorduck so clearly criticized: \"The goals once articulated with intellectual vigor by AI pioneers seemed unattainable.\" [8, p. 417] And fragmentation is at odds with the central goal of SP research to promote simplification and integration of observations and concepts across a broad canon (Appendix A). The penalty for developing these four areas independently is that there is little or no integration between them, and they seem to have little or nothing to do with each other. Since they all deal with aspects of CSRC, it is rather disappointing that there is no benefit to intelligence."}, {"heading": "9.4.2 Unsupervised learning as a guide to CSRK", "text": "Given the current state of development of the SP system, as expressed in the SP computer model, a potentially useful method for developing ideas in the areas of taxonomic thinking, time thinking, action and change, and qualitative thinking, and in other aspects of AI is something like this: 1. Develop unattended learning in the SP system to solve residual problems as outlined in [15, Section 3.3]. 9Use suitable new patterns to examine the best grammars (sets of old patterns) created by unattended learning in the computer model, and9The main problem at the moment is that the SP computer model does not learn intermediate levels of abstraction - but it seems that this problem is solvable. It would also be useful to generalize the computer model to work with patterns in two dimensions. 21Assess how their strengths and weaknesses in the representations of knowledge and in relation to inferential processes in various areas of the CSR.3.

In this context, they write, \"Anyone who has seen what's going on realizes immediately what's going on.

Overall, however, we do not seem to be too far from a comprehensive solution. plausible thinking takes many different forms, including the use of unreliable data; the use of rules whose conclusions are likely but not certain; standard assumptions; the assumption that one's information is complete; reasoning from missing information; reasoning from similar cases; reasoning from typical cases; and others."}, {"heading": "10.3.1 Modelling different kinds of reasoning", "text": "There are reasons why most of them are not able to abide by the rules that they apply in practice.

These remarks apply equally to the different forms of thinking within the actual or potential capabilities of the SP system (Sections 5 and 10.3.1).

in an Appendix, may throw light on aspects of commonsense reasoning (CSR) and commonsense knowledge (CSK) (together shortened to CSRK), as discussed in another paper by Ernest Davis and Gary Marcus (DM). The SP system has the generality needed for CSRK: Turing equivalence; the generality of information compression as the foundation for the SP system both in the representation of knowledge and in concepts of prediction and probability; the versatility of the SP system in the representation of knowledge and in aspects of intelligence including forms of reasoning; and the potential of the system for the seamless integration of diverse forms of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence. Several examples discussed by DM, and how they may be processed in the SP system, are discussed. Also discussed are current successes in CSR (taxonomic reasoning, temporal reasoning, action and change, and qualitative reasoning), how the SP system may promote seamless integration across these areas, and how insights gained from the SP programme of research may yield some potentially useful new ways of approaching these topics. The paper considers how the SP system may help overcome several challenges in the automation of CSR described by DM, and how it meets several of the objectives for research in CSRK that they have described.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
