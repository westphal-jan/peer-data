PROBLEM FORMULATION", "text": "The aim of this work is to explain how the concept of the object can be fundamentally based on the sensorimotor experience of a na\u00efve agent. First, a formal definition of the na\u00efve agent is introduced. Second, the concept of the object is defined by considering the limitations it imposes on the sensorimotor experience of the agent."}, {"heading": "A. Naive agents", "text": "In order to limit as far as possible any bias that robot designers usually introduce into their robot's perception system, the agents we are looking at do not initially have an a priori knowl-ar Xiv: 160 9,08 009v 1 [cs.R O] 26 Sep 2016 about themselves or the world. They are granted agent status thanks to their: \u2022 motor variables, which form a motor configuration known as m, and enable actions in the world, \u2022 sensors whose all elementary excitations represent a sensory state and capture information about the environment, \u2022 data processing medium that supports the processing of sensorimotor data, and potentially the subsequent building of cognitive abilities. A parallel can be drawn here with the minimal cognitive systems described by Beer [21].In the following, we assume that motors are controlled in position without transient phase."}, {"heading": "B. A sensorimotor definition of objects", "text": "The conventional approach to robotics is to rely on models applied to the robot by their designer. However, if such approximate information is missing, a processing system must be built in the agent based on raw sensor-imotor data. In other words, the perception arises when the agent knows how sensor input would be transformed by his own actions. The philosophical discussion triggered by such a claim is outside the scope of this paper. However, it implies some interesting properties for a na\u00efve agent, sensor-imotor contingent can be learned, and a na\u00efve agent can acquire the ability to perceive his environment (or more precisely explore his sensor-imotor states) and detect such coincidences."}, {"heading": "III. DISCOVERING OBJECTS", "text": "To illustrate the sensorimotor approach of objects propagated in this paper, we propose a proof-of-concept algorithm that enables a na\u00efve agent to detect highly probable sensorimotor transitions in the experience he gathers while exploring the world. In other words, let's anticipate the assumption on which the method is based: changes in the world (objects) that move or change have a low probability compared to changes in the motor configuration of the agent. In other words, the agent has enough time to explore his sensorimotor space before there is a new change in the world 1. This hypothesis seems realistic for an agent who explores his surroundings and discovers objects as a baby does while lying in his bed and playing with toys. In fact, the rest of his environment can be considered static while the toy is moving or while he is moving himself."}, {"heading": "A. The algorithm", "text": "a) Initialization: The naive agent is placed in an environment in which at least one object is present. He explores the scene formed by the environment and the object (s) by changing his motor configuration m. Any motor configuration explored in this way is associated with a sensory state si. However, since the predictability of sensorimotor transitions is at the center of this work, this entire set of experiences is stored as triplets. This compulsion could be loosened to ensure that the agent has time to explore at least one significant subset of his sensorimotor space, which can therefore be considered as a single object. In fact, he forms a sensorimotor network in which each transition is highly valid. This compulsion could be loosened to ensure that the agent has time to explore a significant subset of his sensorimotor space between two changes in the world."}, {"heading": "B. Results visualization", "text": "The final step of the algorithm is to identify in matrix D the sets of sensory states associated with high transitions and to visualize them. Due to the way it is constructed, matrix D is such that only one probability P (si, \u2206 mij, sj) is not zero for each entry pair. To simplify the analysis, matrix D is reduced to 2D matrix C by dropping the third dimension and retaining only the non-zero probability for each entry {si, sj}. The remote motor components are stored in a matrix T in which each row corresponds to a starting sensory input si, each column corresponds to a final sensory state sj, and each value corresponds to the relative motor transmission."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In the following, two experiments are presented to test the algorithm proposed in III-A. For each of these experiments, the simulated agent environment system is presented, the exploration process is carried out and the results of spectral clustering are discussed."}, {"heading": "A. Simulation 1: 1D world", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to go to another world, where they go to another world, where they find themselves in another world. In the other world, they find themselves in another world, in which they do not find themselves. In the third world, it is so that they are able to put themselves in another world. In the third world, it is so that they find themselves in another world. In the third world, it is so that they find themselves in another world. In the third world, it is so that they find themselves in another world."}, {"heading": "B. Simulation 2: 2D world with multiple objects", "text": "The algorithm proposed in III-A. was formulated in a generic way. In this second simulation, we introduce a more complex system to illustrate how it expands into more degrees of freedom and more objects in the world. System: The world is similar to simulation 1, but expanded to a two-dimensional space, in which 50 x 50 square elements are arranged in a grid. Three different square objects are placed in the world, each of which consists of 20 x 20 elements with random values. This represents a more realistic scenario, as the environments consist of several independent objects, which can overlap in a random order, drawn each time they move."}, {"heading": "V.
