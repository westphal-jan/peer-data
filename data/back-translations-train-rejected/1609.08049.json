SLRONT acts as the general basis of our approach. All specific domain ontologies should be built by extending to certain aspects. SLRONT contains two subsections, the review protocols and the primary study. The relationship between them is a multi-layered mapping. That is, for a specific systematic literature review protocol, there are many primary studies that refer to it and vice versa. Figure 2 shows the top level of the structure of it.1) Ontology Structure of systematic literature review protocols: According to Kitchenham et al. [1], SLRs correspond to strictly defined procedures and vice versa. The top procedure of SLR comprises three phases, planning, execution and reporting. In order to guarantee the overall quality of the entire procedures, the structural abstractions are."}, {"heading": "B. Extending SLRONT to COSONT", "text": "In order to demonstrate the value of ontology, we extend SLRONT to a more specific version, the COSONT. COSONT is a more detailed ontology, which aims to support cost estimates of systematic literary reviews. Since the quality of unstructured abstractions is not as good as that of structured abstractions, we make a simplification during modeling, so that unstructured abstractions can be transformed into structured ones. Therefore, five sub-classes of structured abstractions are divided into three sub-classes. The main sections of structured abstractions in the \"Method\" part and combine the \"Result\" part in the \"Conclusion\" part with the \"Conclusion\" part, which are divided into the \"Conclusive\" - - - - - - - - - -"}, {"heading": "C. Automated Query and Retrieval", "text": "When COSONT is built, it functions as a knowledge base for further SLR studies. As key knowledge and concepts relevant to specific cost estimation issues are extracted from abstracts and inserted into the ontology structure, researchers could use SPAROL queries to retrieve them. Then, relevant analyses are performed on the retrieved results, which will save much more effort than manually reviewing each literature and extracting information from it.The next section will discuss two case studies.III. CASE STUDY Since regression and neural network are two popular estimates, we will run 2 sample scenarios to find out which approach is better."}, {"heading": "A. Study 1: supporting study selection", "text": "In this step, each student is randomly assigned about 87 of the total of 347 papers. The main criterion for inclusion / exclusion is that the work should mention both regression and neural network models; you should go through the details of the abstracts and filter out these irrelevant ones based on your personal assessment; you were also asked to log the efforts used. By way of comparison, we ask COSONT to automatically check the methodology portion of the abstracts to find relevant papers. Figure 7 gives the SPARQL query and Table I shows the result. As shown in Table 1, 11 papers are eventually identified; the manual selection is quite time-consuming; the total time is 35 person hours. With COSONT, we select the same 11 studies, but the time used by COSONT could be ignored. Note that we need time to construct COSONT, which should be added to the total time needed by the COSONT approach."}, {"heading": "B.
