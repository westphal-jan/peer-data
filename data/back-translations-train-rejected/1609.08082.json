DM preference information as a selection criterion is a good way to address this problem [31, 32]; (2) Testing and selecting solutions from the entire PF is not a trivial task for DM. Visualizing the high-dimensional space further complicates the difficulty. If the DM provides some (even vague) information about his / her preferences, then preferred parts of the PF are highlighted as avoiding DM selection."}, {"heading": "2.2.1. Reference point-based approaches", "text": "Compared to other articulations of preferences, reference point 2, first proposed by Wierzbicki [34] in MCDM [38] was also preferred, is now one of the most commonly used methods in PMOMH due to its natural and intuitive meaning. In general, a reference point is a custom point in objective space that represents the reference level of DM for each target. The earliest reference level is considered as a multi-objective genetic algorithm once a point that dominates the reference point or is equal to the reference point is found. If the reference point is impracticable, the closer solution is related to the reference point, the more it is preferred. The earliest PMOMH is considered as a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) [35] proposed by Fonseca and Fleming. A target vector was used to define a new dominance relationship that gives higher priority to targets that do not meet the objectives, and this method was expanded from Tan to a hard / hard position."}, {"heading": "2.2.2.

Light beam search has also been considered in MOEA / D [58], multi-objective differential evolution and PSO (MDEPSO) [52] and multi-objective immunoalgorithm [59]. Branke and Deb proposed a one-sided crowding distance approach [60] to find a one-sided distribution on the PF. A direction vector should be provided by DM to define an iso-utility function, the crowding distance in NSGA-II is modified to focus solutions parallel to this iso-utility function. This approach was considered an objective scaling method in [11]."}, {"heading": "2.2.3.

Trade-off-based approaches", "text": "According to Miettinen et al. [79], trade-offs can be objective or subjective. On the one hand, a trade-off that depends on the structure of the problem (i.e. changing one goal in relation to changing another as one moves from one practicable solution to another) is an objective trade-off. On the other hand, a trade-off that represents how willing the DM is to sacrifice the value of some goals in order to improve another goal is a subjective trade-off. PMOMHs often deal with subjective trade-offs. The guideline proposed by Branke et al. [80] deals with subjective trade-offs that are given by the DM in the form of a statement: \"A unit of improvement in goal i is worth in most aji units, degradation in goal j.\" The basic idea of this approach is to modify the dominance relationship: A solution x is preferred to an undominated solution if it does not violate the specified part of the trade-off."}, {"heading": "2.2.5. Objective comparison-based approaches", "text": "Objective comparison is referred to as a preference statement for goals, such as \"prefer f1 over f2,\" or classify objectives qualitatively as \"most important, important, less important,\" or describe their meaning quantitatively as weight.Early research focused on weights as a preference articulation [84], but sometimes it is difficult for DM to make weight statements precise. Vague values or blurred preferences became popular. Jin and Sendhoff turned blurred preferences into goals into weight intervals [85], this method being an extension of the method proposed in [86]. Rachmawati and Srinivasan cited relative importance of goals, including strict preference, equality of importance and incomparability between target pairs [87]. An emerging algorithm was also proposed to support a human DM to construct a coherent overall preference model, which is then combined with NSGA-set < a subset of PGIs."}, {"heading": "2.2.6.

Outranking relationship is widely studied in the MCDM field. Fernandez et al. proposed a non-outranking Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NOSGA) [112] to take into account a binary fuzzy preference relationship that expresses the degree of truth of the predicate \"x is at least as good as y.\" Pareto dominance is replaced by outranking relationship and searches for the non-strictly ranked boundary, which is a subset of the PF. The method is expanded to increase the selective pressure toward the best compromise solution later in NOSGA-II [113]."}, {"heading": "2.2.8. Knee point-based approaches", "text": "Knee points of PF are characterized by the fact that a small improvement in one goal results in a large deterioration in other goals. It is comparable to compromise-oriented approaches, but in compromise-oriented approaches the trade-off is explicitly defined by DM, while in knee-point-based approaches no explicit preference is given, the knee point (point with the maximum trade-off) is considered by DM.Bechikh et al. as the preferred proposed KR-NSGA-II [116] based on R-NSGA-II [40], where mobile reference points are used to change the bottleneck distance in the traditional NSGA-II. In each generation, knee points are found in the current population and serve as reference points, the method can be used both a priori and interactively. TKR-NSGA-II [117] is an improved version of KR-NSGA-II [116], in which the knee point approach has been improved."}, {"heading": "3. Introduction to Ontologies", "text": "Ontologies are substantive theories (i.e. theories that explain the specific factors that motivate behavior) about the types of objects, properties of objects, and relationships between objects that are possible in a particular area of knowledge. [118] Addressed initially by the knowledge acquisition community and aimed at \"knowledge modelling,\" ontology design and engineering is now an important research and application topic in many areas, such as the semantic web, knowledge management, e-commerce, etc. The most widely accepted definition of ontology is given by Gruber [119]: \"Ontology is a formal explicit specification of a common conceptualization area for a domain of interest.\" It is formally logical-based and allows mathematical treatment and computational processing. It has explicit specifications, properties, functions, and axioms are explicitly defined."}, {"heading": "4. Building the PMOMH Ontology", "text": "An OWL ontology consists of classes, properties (including object properties and data properties) and individuals. For the sake of legibility, class names are written in a font like this, object property names are in a font like this, file property names are in a font like this. However, a class describes a group of concepts with the same properties in the domain. For example, MOMH is the class of multi-objective metaheuristics. A class can have subclasses that represent more specific concepts than the superclass. For example, PMOMH is a subclass of MOMH that uses preferences to focus the search on preferred parts of the PF. Sub-classes inherit all properties of superclasses. An object property is a binary problem that represents a specific relationship to individuals or a particular data class."}, {"heading": "4.1. Determine the domain and scope of the ontology", "text": "The ontology we develop addresses preference-based, multi-objective metaheuristics, or PMOMHs. They use the preference information provided by the DM a priori or interactively to guide the search to the interesting parts of the PF, rather than searching the whole framework. According to [123], at least two possible paths to integrate EMO and MCDM can be identified: \"evolutionary algorithm in MCDM\" and \"MCDM in EMO\" in the broader sense. The former follows the main method of the MCDM method and uses evolutionary algorithms to obtain intermediate solutions (such as PIE [123]), the latter, \"MCDM in EMO\" or \"MCDM in MOMH\" in the broader sense, was the main area of application in our study. We have collected related literature on this subject (see Table 6), analyzed and derived the important features as ontology. In addition to concepts and knowledge from the specific methodology, the MOH itself is the problem that supports MH."}, {"heading": "4.2. Consider using the existing ontologies", "text": "As far as we know, Evolutionary Computation (EC) Ontology [19], Diversity-Oriented Optimization Ontology [18] and Semantic MCDM (SeMCDM) [124] are to some extent related to PMOMH ontology. Since the ontologies PMOMH, EC, SeMCDM and Diversity-Oriented Optimization define and use a subset of common concepts, this overlapping knowledge has been taken into account in the ontology design of the PMOMH in two ways. The first way is to use the same term for identical concepts, e.g. hasAuthor, hasPublishingYear, canSolve, UtilityFunction. The other way is to specialize the relationships between them using OWL relationships: owyAs Indices, Properties: owowowowl Properties to equivalent Class and Equivalator."}, {"heading": "4.3.

Define the relations between classes (Object Properties)", "text": "Object properties are binary relationships to individuals (of classes), determining how the classes relate to each other. For example, in the assertion \"R-NSGA-II hasPreferenceInformationFromDM ReferencePoint\" hasPreferenceInformationFromDM is an object property whose domain is PMOMH and whose range is PreferenceInformationFromDM, indicating that this property belongs to the class PMOMH and not vice versa. The most important object properties in our ontology are listed in Table 1. Note that a person can be associated with several individuals with the same object property, such as \"R-NSGA-II hasPreferenceInformationFromDM ReferencePoint\" and \"R-NSGA-II hasPreferenceInformationFromDM weights\" stick to the same times.OntoGraf [125] is a (Prote-GE plugin) navigation tool that enables visualization of objects in WL."}, {"heading": "4.6. Define the properties of classes (Data Properties)", "text": "Data properties associate a person with an XML Schema data type value or an RDF literal. In other words, they describe relationships between a person and data values. For example, hasPublishingYear is a data property of R-NSGA-II with the data type \"Integer,\" which indicates the year in which R-NSGA-II was published. The most important data properties defined in our ontology are in Table 2.There are three data properties describing the characteristics of PMOMH: hasMultipleRegionOfInterest indicates whether the DM method provides the ability to obtain more than one ROI in a run; hasSpreadControl describes whether the method allows the DM to control the propagation of the obtained ROI; ParetoDominance shows whether the method maintains the order induced by Pareto dominance.

Using the PMOMH Ontology", "text": "Because an ontology has been created, many knowledge management tasks can be performed using ontology along with other tools such as rationalizers, DL query, and visualization tools. Rationalizers can check the consistency of an ontology, perform submission checks (check if a concept is a subset of a different concept), and establish relationships that are not explicitly stated by the user. DL query is another important feature of prerogatives that can help access, analyze, and explore the knowledge domain described in ontology. Examples of reasoning and query are available in [122]. Based on these functions, we can use PMOMH ontology for various purposes that are given next."}, {"heading": "5.1. Finding the right method for an application", "text": "Application to real problems is the ultimate goal of developing different PMOMH. Different problems have different characteristics, such as the type of decision variables used, e.g. continuous / discrete; or the number of targets, e.g. multi or multiple targets; or the shape of the PF, e.g. convex, concave, separate. PMOMH ontology can help to find methods that fit a specific problem. For example, a satellite task planning problem requires optimizing the execution plan for the satellite in order to achieve certain objectives. It can be modeled as a multi-objective combinatory optimization problem similar to the known tornister problem. The objectives to be considered are to maximize the total gain and minimize the total cost. If DM wishes to use the pair-wise comparison as a preference articulation, then we can search the PMOMH ontology for a workable algorithm for this problem [90, Abb. 7, IMA 10MA] that problems are not."}, {"heading": "5.2.

Similar analyses can be performed on PMOMH domains using ontology. Fig. 8 shows the distribution of publication years of 86 PMOMH individuals. Table 4 and Table 5 show the top-5 most frequently cited PMOMH individuals and top-5 researchers ranked by number of published PMOMH individuals relative to the 86 PMOMH individuals in ontology."}, {"heading": "5.3. Reviewing and Research Assessment", "text": "Using DL Query, researchers can easily review and access existing work. For example, they can find out whether a preference model or integration method has been used before, which work has compared their developed method (s) with a particular method (e.g. who compared their proposed method with R-NSGA-II [40]?), they can ask for methods that use a specific benchmark problem (e.g. ZDT1) when they want to compare results on the same problem, they can also ask for relationships between algorithms (e.g. extension and interactive version) or they can search for algorithms that use the same preference information (e.g. reference point)."}, {"heading": "5.4. Classification", "text": "There are various criteria to classify the PMOMHs, such as interaction time, preference information, search algorithm, to name a few. Prote \"ge\" can add the results of a query to new classes, making classification simple and flexible. For example, we can query for PMOMHs that use reference points as preference information, and add the results to a new class of reference point-based PMOMH that is a subclass of PMOMH. Any PMOMH that is added in the future using reference points will be automatically sorted into this subclass.

Identification of promising research areas", "text": "Empty cells in Table 6 can be identified as future research topics to integrate preference articulation with MOMH's that such a combination was not previously considered. Integration method and preference model can also be queried to find potential combinations. We can also note the following: \u2022 Not all MCDM methods are included in this ontology. Classification of objective functions, for example, is a category of interactive MCDM methods [79]. At each interaction phase, DM is shown the current Pareto-optimal solution and asked to classify the targets into several categories, i.e., whose values should be improved (up to some desired aspiration level), whose values may be affected (up to some upper limit), whose values may be changed temporarily freely. This type of MCDM method has not been integrated into MOMH, which may be a topic to be considered in the future. \u2022 Some PMOMH individuals have an interactive version (such as W-88 [W-E and HypW] iW."}, {"heading": "5.6. Maintenance and Extension", "text": "The PMOMH ontology provides a structure and is open to new classes / individuals that can be added with the development of MCDM and MOMH fields. In WebProte \u0301 ge, users can easily edit the ontology (OWL file) (e.g. revise properties, add comments), create (add new individuals / classes / properties), delete (false / redundant individuals / classes / properties) and download. For example, users can assume that the composition-based MOEA should be referred to as an aggregation-based MOEA as in [136], which can be added as a comment to the class. By discussing and collaborating with researchers from related fields, the ontology becomes more trustworthy and robust. The value of the proposed ontology increases as more information accumulates. MOMH researchers can help expand the MOMH classes, MCDM researchers can help with preference information / model classes by adding more practical applications."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "We proposed a novel methodology for systematizing and managing current knowledge in this field through ontology design and engineering. For the first time, an ontology was designed and used in this area, which has high advantages and advantages for knowledge management in the fields of MOMH and MCDM. After providing an overview of PMOMH's, we presented the process for building PMOMH ontology by means of protocols, introduced typical use cases, including application method matching, bibliomatric analysis, research evaluations and new research opportunities. The result of this article represents knowledge in a formal, computer-readable manner, which will allow other researchers to make specific queries. We also consider ontology to be an evolving system and want to encourage the integration of future research outcomes. It is assumed that the greater attention and information of MOMH systems is also relevant for the research of MH communities of greater importance than the MH-MH."}], "references": [{"title": "A hybrid framework for evolutionary multi-objective optimization", "author": ["K.

in particular in many objective optimization. Preferences have long been considered in traditional multicriteria decision making (MCDM) which is based on mathematical programming. Recently, it is integrated in multi-objective metaheuristics (MOMH), resulting in focus on preferred parts of the Pareto front instead of the whole Pareto front. The number of publications on preference-based multiobjective metaheuristics has increased rapidly over the past decades. There already exist various preference handling methods and MOMH methods, which have been combined in diverse ways. This article proposes to use the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to model and systematize the results developed in this field. A review of the existing work is provided, based on which an ontology is built and instantiated with state-of-the-art results. The OWL ontology is made public and open to future extension. Moreover, the usage of the ontology is exemplified for different usecases, including querying for methods that match an engineering application, bibliometric analysis, checking existence of combinations of preference models and MOMH techniques, and discovering opportunities for new research and open research questions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
