Here we provide a computational model of time travel and a computer program that allows exploring digital time travel. In order to explain our method we formalize a simplified version of the famous grandfather paradox, show how the system can allow the participant to go back in time, try to kill their ancestors before they were born, and experience the consequences. The system has even come up with scenarios that can be considered consistent \"solutions\" of the grandfather paradox. We discuss the conditions for digital time travel, which indicate that it has a large number of practical applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 15:09:29 GMT  (1124kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08470v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["doron friedman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08470"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.08470.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A computer program for simulating time travel and a possible 'solution' for the grandfather paradox", "authors": ["Doron Friedman"], "emails": ["doronf@idc.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "While the possibility of time travel is still being discussed in physics, the virtual age opens up new possibilities for exploring this time and its consequences in the digital world."}, {"heading": "2.1 Logic", "text": "The biggest challenge in providing a digital time experience is the automatic tracking of causality chains. Fortunately, there are abundant formalizations and techniques in arithmetic logic and artificial intelligence that can be used to track causality. We have opted for the Boolean spread of limitations; this is a simple mechanism we have used in the past for automated thinking related to VR applications. Units in this layer are terms, facts and limitations. The terms in our grandfather paradox are mainly people and actions (supplementary text, p. 1). Facts are functions or actions that are applied to other terms. Exactly one of the terms must denote the current time to which the fact applies.

These limitations reflect the semantics of the act.

A generic proactive reasoning method, designed to keep the altered history as close as possible to the original, can be formally written as follows.
