INTRODUCTION", "text": "In this paper, we describe the Digital Urban Violence Analysis (DUVVA) approach, a collaborative, qualitative analysis method that is used to inform natural language processing techniques that predict clusters of aggressive language on Twitter that can turn into deadly and non-fatal gun violence. Recently, several studies (Patton et al. 2015; Patton et al. 2016b) have examined the relationship between social media and gang violence. This study found that young people living in violent neighborhoods bully each other and brag about violence on social media platforms that can lead to gun violence, a behavior known as Internet bang or cyber bang (Patton, Eschmann, Butler, 2013). These studies have in-depth, qualitative methods that hand code each post to encode text from known gang-related youth media that make a good exchange conference."}, {"heading": "2. CORPUS", "text": "We analyzed the Twitter communications of Gakirah Barnes and her most frequent communicators. Gakirah Barnes was a 17-year-old gang member from Chicago who set up the online Twitter account @ TyquanAssassin in memory of her friend Tyquan Tyler, who was allegedly killed by a rival gang in 2013. We chose to focus on Gakirah because she had posted over 27,000 tweets on Twitter from December 2011 until her own death on April 11, 2014. She used her account to express the events of her daily life, which ranged from friendships and other relationships to gang violence, and mourned the deaths of her peers to gun violence. We used Radian6, a social media tracking service, to capture a total sample of 10,000 tweets of, mentions and responses to @ TyquanAssassin. We used 800 of the 10,0000 tweets during a two-week period beginning with the day that Gakirah was killed on March 29, 2014, according to the Chicago Police Department's Facebook page. \"We analyzed the Twitter communications of Gakirah Barnes and her most frequent communicators.

HUMAN ANNOTATION OF DATA", "text": "We created an interdisciplinary research team consisting of two Chicago teenagers, a social work professor, two master's students of social work, three data scientists, and two undergraduates of basic research (Ford, 2014). We describe DUVAA and apply it to building a natural language processing tool to predict clusters of aggression and loss among Chicago youths. 3.1. Qualitative Analysis To begin our analysis, we hired two young men of color from a Chicago neighborhood with high rates of violence, who were asked to translate 800 tweets from Gakirah Barnes during a two-week period following two shootings: the death of Gakirah's close communication and then her subsequent death."}, {"heading": "3.2 Natural Language Processing", "text": "At this stage of the work, we used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop an automatic classification of tweets that can categorize tweets into our three categories of \"aggression,\" \"grief\" and \"others.\" The problem for NLP is two-fold: First, the tweets are not in standard English; second, the classification task is difficult; and we discuss it again. The tweets in our collection present three challenges. First, they are tweets - Twitter, with its unique communicative conventions, has evolved into its own genre, which includes emoticons, hashtags, URLs, unconventional spelling and sometimes telegraphic grammar. Second, the authors of the tweets use Afro-American English, whose grammar differs in some respects from that of standard American English. Finally, the language of Chicago gangs has conventions and vocabularies that we believe have influenced the Interannotator Agreement."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION", "text": "We were motivated by increasing rates of gang violence in American cities to develop a collaboration between social workers and data scientists aimed at understanding the link between these violent acts and language and communication on social media sites. However, we found few resources or corpora based on the unique language and communication style of gang-like youth in cities that are often part of these situations. In this post we describe the interaction between an in-depth textual analytical approach that focuses on the development of a social theory, and a data-driven machine learning approach to the development of natural language processing systems to recognize that a social media post could lead to violence in the real world. In this project, we used the products of indirect text analysis, a set of Twitter posts and a coding system as a note for a natural language corpus that is designed to develop systems for processing these types of posts. Rounds of qualitative analysis focused on the data tools we were using to target the data scientists with the help of social media to develop the data science."}, {"heading": "5.
