Existing methods typically rely on surface lexical and syntactic information. Yet, research in psychology shows that patterns of human conceptualisation, such as metaphorical framing, are reliable predictors of human expectations and decisions. In this paper, we present a method to learn patterns of metaphorical framing from large text collections, using statistical techniques. We apply the method to data in three different languages and evaluate the identified patterns, demonstrating their psychological validity.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 17:58:23 GMT  (549kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09019v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ekaterina shutova", "patricia lichtenstein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09019"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.09019.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Psychologically Motivated Text Mining", "authors": ["Ekaterina Shutova", "Patricia Lichtenstein"], "emails": ["es407@cam.ac.uk", "tricia1@uchicago.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "In recent years, it has been shown that most people are people who are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves.

Participants first read a brief description of the task that introduced them to a fictitious country where economists are developing a graph depicting changes in the economy, then filled out a demographic questionnaire with information about their native language. Results from 9 US and 3 non-US participants were discarded because they did not meet linguistic requirements.Participants navigated to a new page to complete the experimental task. Suggestions were presented in a 1200 x 700 pixel framework, the center of the frame contained a sphere with a 64-pixel diameter. For each study, participants clicked on a button to activate an animation of the sphere that (1) displayed a positive shift (in right-directional pixels) or a contrast of 10% or 20%, or negative shift (in xdirectional pixels)."}, {"heading": "7.2 Results", "text": "In studies where stimuli moving to the right simultaneously shrank, English and Spanish speakers responded that the economy had improved 66% and 43% of the time, respectively; in studies where stimuli moving to the left simultaneously expanded, English and Spanish speakers judged the economy to have improved 34% and 55% of the time, respectively; these results suggest that the judgments of English and Spanish speakers tended to be more oriented toward shifting spheres, while Spanish speakers made judgments related to changes in the diameter. To investigate the significance of these effects, we adjusted the data to a binary Logit hybrid effect model (Fox and Weisberg, 2011). Full analysis modelled judgments with native language, shifting and size as fully crossed fixed effects and participants as a random effect. This analysis confirmed that the mother tongue was linked to participants \"judgments about economic change."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a method that identifies patterns of the metaphorical frame in a large body of text. Although it is completely unattended, it works with ecouraging precision. It is portable across datasets and languages, and detects interesting cross-linguistic differences in the metaphorical framework. We have shown that the method predicts patterns that are consistent with behavioral data. Although much remains to be studied in terms of delineating the nature of this relationship, these results represent a first step toward establishing a link between information obtained from large collections of text and information observed through behavioral responses at the human level."}], "references": [{"title": "Subgroup detection in ideological discussions", "author": ["Mona Diab", "Pradeep Dasigi", "Dragomir Radev"], "venue": "In Proceedings of ACL, ACL \u201912,", "citeRegEx": "Abu.Jbara et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Abu.Jbara et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Staying informed: Supervised and semisupervised multi-view topical analysis of ideological perspective", "author": ["Ahmed", "Xing2010] Amr Ahmed", "Eric P.
