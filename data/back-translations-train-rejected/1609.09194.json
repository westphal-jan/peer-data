Risk assessment involves integrating heterogeneous clinical sources with different representations of different health care providers, making the task increasingly complex. Such sources are typically extensive, diverse, and change significantly over time. Therefore, distributed and parallel computing tools, collectively referred to as big data tools, are needed to help physicians make the right clinical decision. In this paper, we propose a multi-modular predictive architecture, a novel approach to combine the predictiveness of multiple models for better predictive counter-accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed work based on data from the Framingham Heart Study results. The results show that the proposed multi-modular predictive architecture is able to provide better accuracy than the best model approach we are able to select by predicting the partial results from the model."}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "The current clinical and pharmaceutical environment is data-intensive, with large amounts of data such as patient narratives, scan reports, clinical laboratory tests, and administrative data routinely produced. [1] These clinical data are stored as single files in multiple repositories. [2] This diversified information can come from different systems and be separated geographically, and is also kept as case files consisting of medical correspondence. [3] This data is stored as single files in multiple repositories. (4) It is maintained in clinical laboratories and scanning systems."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "A number of research has been undertaken in the field of healthcare, and there is an enormous amount of data that remains untapped, and this data is growing rapidly in terms of the size, complexity and speed of the generation.4 This paper presents a review of various algorithms from 1994-2013 that are needed to deal with such a large dataset. [5] Defining the process of generating a context-based view of patient records can be summarised in three steps: 1) aggregating patient data from different clinical sources; 2) structuring patient records to identify problems, findings and attributes reported in clinical reports, and mapping them with available knowledge sources; and 3) generating a tailor-made representation based on comments provided by knowledge sources, but their work suggests that the disease model may not fully meet the information needs of a physician performing a specific task."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY", "text": "Most of the heart failure prediction systems [10, 11] follow the best model approach, either tuning the model or transforming the available data for better performance of the prediction systems. Such systems involve complex mathematical models and are difficult to convert into optimized applications; they lack the generality in which they can easily be converted into a full-fledged product. Data transformation can either lead to the addition of redundant information or to the loss of valuable information from the data. In the proposed model, we will try to bring in the required generality by using models in their absolute form. Open Source Data Mining tools are used to generate such prediction models. We employ both classification and cluster techniques with the aim of integrating more information into the system. Classification models are built for predicting and errors of these models, which help in deciding on the participation of models in prediction dynamics.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The effectiveness of multi-model prediction was tested on the Framingham dataset [14], which consists of 1500 patient records. It is a subset of data from the Framingham study and includes laboratory / clinical data from 1500 patients. Table 2 shows a snapshot of the Framingham dataset, with the main objective of the multi-model being to predict the class field in the data, i.e. to determine whether the patient will be alive or dead. Further explanations on different areas can be found in [14]."}, {"heading": "Id Sex Age FRW SBP DBP CHOL CIG CHD Class", "text": "For the entire modeling, Weka, a data mining tool was used [15], with 75% as training data and 25% as test data. The proposed multi-model approach was implemented as map reduce streaming jobs, which are suitable for operation on Hadoop Framework [16] under C #.Net Framework. The proposed multi-model approach is compared with the best model approach. 25 prediction models were trained on the data set, the best model being regression by discrediting with a prediction efficiency of 82.42%. Model efficiency is given by Equation 1. Table 3 shows various prediction models trained using the Weka tool, along with their prediction effect. As explained in the section on proposed methodology, the multi-model prediction approach was implemented in two phases. In phase one, in which each pre-model was given a static weight of 0.04 (i.e., 1), the build-up of a model was estimated at 4.25%."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we analyzed a generic architecture for clinical decision-making and predictive modeling based on existing information management systems or enterprise healthcare data warehouse. Results show that the proposed multi-tiered predictive architecture is capable of providing better accuracy than the best model approach. By modelling the error of predictive models, we are able to select sub-models that deliver accurate results."}], "references": [{"title": "A Case-based Retrieval System using Natural Language Processing and Population-based Visualization.", "author": ["Hsu", "William", "Ricky K.
