Heuristics takes a greedy approach to creating the initial solution and then uses elements of local search and taboo search to improve the initial solution. The results obtained are promising as they show improvements in most cases. The following work should be aimed at improving the speed of the algorithm and also guarantee the best possible results. One way to improve the algorithm is to use a new neighborhood - swap neighborhood where two customers can be exchanged from different routes, and there are other restrictions that can be relaxed, such as time windows and shared deliveries."}, {"heading": "5 Acknowledgments", "text": "The author is supported by LATNA Laboratory, NRU HSE, RF government grant, ag. 11.G34.31.0057."}, {"heading": "6 References", "text": "1.
