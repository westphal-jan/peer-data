So far, the use of the voter rating matrix, the literature has focused on voter categorization rather than item categorization [1]. The authors use a varying algorithm to derive the categories. In contrast to these approaches, a new ranking (choice) model is presented among the categories, followed by the use of community recognition algorithms coupled with a random usage model for category selection."}, {"heading": "II.

For each voter, the following process is repeated. Each of the categories is randomly selected from 1 to C. Then, each of the S points of the C categories is specified with a unique random integer value in the range [CiS, (Ci + 1) S) where Ci is the position of the category in order. This process produces a proper ranking system of N = SC elements with elements in the same category, initially placed near an anode. Once all elements are placed, the mixing process begins."}, {"heading": "A. Relation to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM)", "text": "In this section, we will reveal the relationship between this model and the stochastic block model (SBM) 2, which has recently been used to derive information-theoretical boundaries. [5] In the standard block model, the input parameters are the size of the community, the number of communities, the density within the community (pin or \u03b1), and the density between communities (pout or \u03b2). The output is a diagram of the size of the community \u00b7 number of communities, in which the chance of an edge between nodes of the same community is equal and the chance of an edge between nodes of different communities is \u03b2. It is clear that in this ranking model S and C are directly representative of the size and number of community parameters in the standard block model. It is necessary to examine the algorithm 2 that actually introduces the edges to determine how \u03b1 and \u03b2 relate to the standard block model. Algorithm 2 contains a threshold that serves as a cutoff for the analysis of when an edge becomes and b."}, {"heading": "B. Analysis of Similarity Function", "text": "Since the calculation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 is an implicit calculation, it is useful to calculate the expected values of the similarity function for elements of the same category and those in different categories as a representative for the investigation of these measurements. First, we introduce the similarity function, which we use in the algorithm and analysis: Sim (a, b, N) = 1 \u2212 | a \u2212 b | N. As discussed above, this function is chosen because it gives elements that are ranked closer to each other higher weights than elements that are ranked very differently. As a threshold, only the addition of edges representing strong relationships should result, the expected value of our similarity function is used. In this calculation, it is assumed that there is an equal chance to choose any pair of elements a and b. Lemma II.1. Expected value of the similarity function: E [| a \u2212 b |] = N + 1 3 = \u21d2 E [S (a, b, N) = 1 \u2212 3 (N) x)."}, {"heading": "1) Analysis of Similarity Function for Elements of the Same", "text": "Category: As mentioned above, since the calculation of \u03b1 is implicit, it is obviously useful to consider what the expected value for the similarity function would be between elements of the same category. \u2212 All that needs to be taken into account is the value of the distance, since the value of the similarity function is inversely proportional to the distance. (The expected distance is calculated by calculating the distance between all possible combinations of elements. \u2212 Situations involving mixing must also be taken into account. \u2212 The total distance of all possible pairs of elements can be calculated, regardless of where a new element, X, is in; X can be interchanged with any other element (X can be interchanged with any other element of the category) \u2212 To calculate the number of possible places to be interchanged in the category, multiply by the (S 2) different element pairs to obtain the total distance combinations."}, {"heading": "2) Analysis of Similarity Function for Elements in Different", "text": "Categories: The analysis of the distance function for elements in different categories is somewhat more difficult. As categories may have different distances from each other (S = 1), a new variable, D, is introduced to mark this distance. To give an example of this measurement, if two elements are in adjacent categories, D = 0 if they are two away, i.e. category 1 and category 3, then D = 1. Lemma II.4. Expected intercategory Distance with 1 SwapE [a \u2212 b | diff] = (1 + (S \u2212 1) 2) S3 (D + 1) + 4S \u2212 1 i (S \u2212 i) S4 (6) Proof. See Application example BWe can also extend this formulation to the situation where there are elements that are interchanged from the other category. Since all elements interchange, there is no need to introduce the Xi variables that are comparable in the intracategory. Lemma III.5.
