Projecting the input vectors onto this space of re-description is then intended to facilitate further processing and interpretation of the data. Learning then coincides with the creation of a vocabulary of shapes that serve as keys to the interpretation of the data. However, there are few examples in the literature in which automatic coding algorithms ultimately learn a law of control in a continuous space of action. This difficulty seems to stem from the conceptual separation between the approach of dynamic systems on the one hand and the pattern that fits each other.From the perspective of the dynamic system, a common simplification considers a controller and its environment as a single dynamic system, with a reciprocal coupling between an internal part dedicated to data processing and an internal space that is moving through an external and internal space."}, {"heading": "2 Quick mathematic overview", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Closed-loop control", "text": "Control loops are generally described with two state spaces, namely the control room Xin, whose state at the time is t x in t-Xin, and the physical space Xout, whose state at the time is t xoutt-Xout. General development of the system is ensured by a set of 4 stochastic update equations, i.e.: x out t + dt-Pout (x out t, ut) (1) It-Qin (x out t) (2) x in t + dt-Pin (x in t, It) (3) ut-Qout (x in t) (4), where eq. (1) the external update, eq. (2) the sensor update, eq. (3) the internal update and eq. (4) the motor realization with it the sensory input, ut the command, the (external) generative process, Qin the measurement, pin the internal program and Qout the command chain."}, {"heading": "2.2 Active sensing", "text": "In most cases, the external process is considered hidden, and only the sensory sequence is observable."}, {"heading": "3 Learning to predict", "text": "However, the realization and implementation of these predictable transformations in a neural circuit (suitable for learning) is proving to be more difficult than expected, mainly due to the lack of a defined (operational) distance in the control room that implements learning, as opposed to physical space that implements actions. In learning, the universality of a learning scheme (its ability to learn any transformation) is mostly based on the use of nonlinear transfer functions in one step (at least) of the data processing path, such as threshold functions, Argmax, signatures, cores, etc. (Haykin, 1999) The many modern learning techniques used in pattern recognition rely on these nonlinear steps to obtain sufficient discriminatory power and extract common features from many samples. Therefore, the pattern matching approach does not guarantee the proportionality of treatments between near and distant parts of physical space."}, {"heading": "4 Alternate view", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to decide for themselves what they want to do, and they don't."}, {"heading": "5 Concluding remarks", "text": "A first remark, once brain modeling is considered, is the likely combination of several control principles that serve different purposes in biological systems. If end-effector control happens to have interesting predictive abilities, a counterpart is a certain lack of adaptability to changing conditions. Changes in body inclination, muscle fatigue, or an effector error can have dramatic consequences on the final precision of motion. Parallel and rapidly adaptive control is expected in the cerebellum, with the ability to deflect the fly's motor orders at the time it is sent to the muscles. The cerebellum has proven to be sensitive to the motor error and to be able to calculate a shift correction (Wolpert et al., 1998; Haruno et al., 2001; Dean et al., 2010) The enormous number of neurons implicated in this calculation, the perspective can be calculated as soon as the computational problem meets the follow-object."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning and communication via imitation: An autonomous robot perspective", "author": ["P.
