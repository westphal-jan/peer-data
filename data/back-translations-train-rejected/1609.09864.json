Although a number of structured sparsity models have been explored, such as trees, groups, clusters, and paths, connected subgraphs have been rarely explored in the current literature. One of the main technical challenges is that there is no structured sparsity-inducing norm that can directly model the space of connected subgraphs, and there is no exact implementation of a projection oracle for connected subgraphs due to its NP-hardness. In this paper, we explore efficient approximate projection oracles for connected subgraphs, and propose two new efficient algorithms, namely, Graph-IHT and Graph-GHTP, to optimize a generic nonlinear objective function subject to connectivity constraint on the support of the variables. Our proposed algorithms enjoy strong guarantees analogous to several current methods for sparsity-constrained optimization, such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Approximate Model Iterative Hard Thresholding (AM-IHT), and Gradient Hard Thresholding Pursuit (GHTP) with respect to convergence rate and approximation accuracy. We apply our proposed algorithms to optimize several well-known graph scan statistics in several applications of connected subgraph detection as a case study, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 19:26:26 GMT  (671kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09864v1", "11 pages in 2016 IEEE International Conference of Data Mining"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages in 2016 IEEE International Conference of Data Mining", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["baojian zhou", "feng chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09864"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.09864.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Technical Report: Graph-Structured Sparse Optimization for Connected Subgraph Detection", "authors": ["Baojian Zhou", "Feng Chen"], "emails": ["bzhou6@albany.edu", "fchen5@albany.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In recent years, structured, sparse methods have attracted a lot of attention in many areas such as bioinformatics, medical image processing, social networks and astronomy [2], [4], [16], [17], [17], [16], [17], [17], [17], [17], [17], [17], [17], [17], [17], [17], [17], [16], [16], [16], [17], [17], [17], [17], [17], [17], \"[17],\" [17], \"[17],\" [17], \"[17],\" [17], \"[17],\" [17], \"[17],\" [17], \"17,\" [17], \"[17,\" [19], \",\" [19, \",\" 19, \",\", \"19,\", \",\", \",\" 19, \"[19],\", \"[19,\", \",\" [19], \",\", \"[19],\", \"[19,\", \",\", \"[19],\", \",\" [19], \",\", \",\", \"[19],\", \",\", \",\" [19, \",\", \",\", \",\" [19], \",\", \",\", \",\" [19], \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\" [19], \",\", \",\", \",\""}, {"heading": "II.

(8) Problem (8) is difficult to solve because it includes decision variables of a non-convex group composed of many disjunctive subsets. In this paper, we will develop approximate linear time algorithms to approximately solve problem (8), the basic idea being to break this problem down into more easily solvable sub-problems. These sub-problems include an optimization problem f (x) that is independent of M (G, k), and projection approximations for M (G, k), including T (x) and H (x). We will design efficient algorithms to solve these problems with good timing (8)."}, {"heading": "III.

Note that a heuristic rounding process, as proposed in [29], is applied to continuous vector xi values estimated by GenFusedLasso at each iteration i to identify the best connected subgraph in the current iteration. As setting the parameter \u03bb affects the quality of the detected connected subgraph, the results are also presented in various aspects in Figure 2.

Results indicate that our proposed method GRAPH-GHTP ran faster in most settings than all base methods except EventTree. EventTree was the fastest method, but was unable to detect high-quality subgraphs. Since our method has a parameter at the upper limit (k) of the returned subgraph, we also performed the scalability of our method with respect to different values of k as shown in Figure 2. Results suggest that the runtime of our algorithm is insensitive to the setting of k, which is consistent with the time complexity analysis of GRAPH-GHTP, as described in Theorem II.5."}, {"heading": "VI.

The latest method is a brunch-and-bounding algorithm DepthFirstGraphScan [36], which at worst expands exponentially; 2) Heuristic algorithms.

data in a variety of applications such as bioinformatics, medical imaging, social networks, and astronomy. Although a number of structured sparsity models have been explored, such as trees, groups, clusters, and paths, connected subgraphs have been rarely explored in the current literature. One of the main technical challenges is that there is no structured sparsity-inducing norm that can directly model the space of connected subgraphs, and there is no exact implementation of a projection oracle for connected subgraphs due to its NP-hardness. In this paper, we explore efficient approximate projection oracles for connected subgraphs, and propose two new efficient algorithms, namely, GRAPH-IHT and GRAPH-GHTP, to optimize a generic nonlinear objective function subject to connectivity constraint on the support of the variables. Our proposed algorithms enjoy strong guarantees analogous to several current methods for sparsity-constrained optimization, such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Approximate Model Iterative Hard Thresholding (AM-IHT), and Gradient Hard Thresholding Pursuit (GHTP) with respect to convergence rate and approximation accuracy. We apply our proposed algorithms to optimize several well-known graph scan statistics in several applications of connected subgraph detection as a case study, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
