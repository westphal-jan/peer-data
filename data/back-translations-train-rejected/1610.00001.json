Reactive power compensation is a major problem in electrical networks, which is also a major cause of the voltage collapse, which can lead to complete power outages [1]. Therefore, it is necessary to control reactive power to reduce the difference between power generation and load demand. In order to improve the quality, stability and reliability of the power supply, it can also lead to transient stability oscillations."}, {"heading": "A.

For tuning PID controllers or obtaining the optimal values (K, K & K), each particle in the entire swarm search is capable of updating its local best position (p) and speed to global position (g) and velocity as shown in Fig. 4.The PSO algorithm can be described in steps as follows: Step 1: Starting point of particle size and population size, dimension of the search space at random position and velocity. Step 2: Update the desired fitness Particle Particle Particle Reduction is available."}, {"heading": "E.

In this process of foraging, the bacterium communicates with each other by sending signals. This optimization process is mainly based on four sequential mechanisms: chemotaxis, swarming and elimination of pollutants. [16] The algorithm of bacteria formation optimization can be summarized as follows: Step 1: Initialization of all variables, population size N, search criteria (J), proportional gain (K), profit function (K), etc."}, {"heading": "A. Stability test under normal loading", "text": "To verify the performance of the proposed stabilizers under normal load conditions, the following variations caused by a fault are taken into account: (a) nominal load (P, Q, V) = (0.7, 0.3, 1.0) pu; it is observed that when simulating the SMIB system with STATCOM controller with PID controller, PSO-PID and BFOPID, the fluctuation of the system voltage provides oscillation control around the nominal voltage of 1 pu, as shown in Figure 5 (a). The corresponding variation in the system angle frequency is shown in Figure 5 (b)."}, {"heading": "B. Stability test under smaller variation in loading", "text": "Once again, the stability of STATCOM is tested in the SMIB under lower load fluctuations (10-20% over nominal value) and the deviations considered are described below using error-related parameters: (b) nominal load (P, Q, V) = (1.2, 0.4, 1.15) pu; STATCOM is observed with PID controller, PSO-PID and BFO-PID controller, which stabilizes the voltage of the SMIB remotely, as shown in Figure 6 (a), where the nominal voltage is 1 pu. Also, the deviation of the angular frequency under the same operating state is shown in Figure 6 (b). Again, it is observed that both PSO and BFO stabilize the voltage and frequency relatively better than the conventional PID controller, which is designed for heuristic hit-and-trial tuning method, thus reducing times."}, {"heading": "C.
