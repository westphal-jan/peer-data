To ensure accurate execution of web services operations, it must be adaptable with policies of the social networks in which it signs up. This adaptation implements using controls called 'Commitment'. This paper describes commitments structure and existing research about commitments and social web services, then suggests an algorithm for consistency of commitments in social web services. As regards the commitments may be executed concurrently, a key challenge in web services execution based on commitment structure is consistency ensuring in execution time. The purpose of this research is providing an algorithm for consistency ensuring between web services operations based on commitments structure.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Oct 2016 04:59:05 GMT  (1630kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00086v1", "International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security (IJCSIS), Vol. 14, No. 8, August 2016. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1412.0152"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security (IJCSIS), Vol. 14, No. 8, August 2016. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1412.0152", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI", "authors": ["marzieh adelnia", "mohammad reza khayyambashi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00086"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.00086.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Consistency Ensuring in Social Web Services Based on Commitments Structure", "authors": ["Marzieh Adelnia", "Mohammad Reza Khayyambashi"], "emails": ["adelniya_m@yahoo.com", "m.r.khayyambashi@eng.ui.ac.ir"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move into a different world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live."}], "references": [{"title": "EVOLUTION OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB: FROM WEB 1.0 TO WEB 4.0", "author": ["S.
