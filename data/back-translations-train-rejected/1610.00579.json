We describe a two-step framework that achieves these two goals in a robust, fast, online, and unsupervised manner. First, we adapt stable principal component pursuit to detect anomalies for each road segment. This allows us to pinpoint traffic anomalies early and precisely in space. Then we group the road-level anomalies across time and space into meaningful anomaly events using a simple graph expansion procedure. These events can be easily clustered, visualized, and analyzed by urban planners. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using 7 weeks of anonymized and aggregated cellular location data in Dallas-Fort Worth. We suggest potential opportunities for urban planners and policy makers to use our methodology to make informed changes. These applications include real-time re-routing of traffic in response to abnormally high traffic, or identifying candidates for high-impact infrastructure projects.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 01:58:12 GMT  (1967kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00579v1", "Presented at the Data For Good Exchange 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at the Data For Good Exchange 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zhengyi zhou", "philipp meerkamp", "chris volinsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00579"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.00579.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Quantifying urban traffic anomalies", "authors": ["Zhengyi Zhou", "Philipp Meerkamp", "Chris Volinsky"], "emails": ["zzhou@research.att.com", "pmeerkamp@bloomberg.net", "volinsky@research.att.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

We use anonymized and aggregated cellular data to derive traffic flow in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, for a seven-week period at the end of 2015. Mobile network positioning has the advantage of lower battery consumption and longer range compared to GPS [26], but the location samples can be quite noisy; we observe devices only at relatively sparse locations of cellular towers connected to the devices. The top order of the roads these devices might travel on is derived from a probable matching algorithm [29]. Traffic volume on most roads shows a strong weekly seasonality (see Figure 1). The road network in Dallas-Fort Worth (and many other cities) is very heterogeneous. Roads near roads (e.g. highways and exits) or the same roads near people who are displaced (see Figure 1) can vary widely."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related work", "text": "Many traffic anomaly detection methods are based on a regional basis, discrediting a city into several regions, and detection of traffic anomalies occurs across regions. Studies [24] and [25] divide a city into uniform networks and report anomalies when adjacent cells have very different overall traffic volumes. However, these region-based methods cannot identify road-level anomalies, are sensitive to the definition of regions (rough subdivision can lead to loss of information) and suffer from a \"border problem\" (traffic or border anomaly can be split into several regions); these disadvantages are described in detail in [19] and [13]. Existing road-based traffic anomaly detection methods allow strong assumptions about traffic. For example, [19] and [30] assume that traffic is normally distributed in the past or neighbourhood."}, {"heading": "2.

PCP dissects a data matrix T as T = L + A, where L is a low fit of T and A is a sparse matrix representing anomaly, i.e. the goal is L, Arank (L) + \u03bb | | 0, subj T \u2212 L \u2212 A = 0, (1) where storm > 0 is a linear combination parameter commonly taken to be the anomaly (m, n)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Adapting SPCP for traffic anomalies", "text": "In fact, we are able to set out in search of new paths that will lead us into the future."}, {"heading": "2.3 Computation and alternative approaches", "text": "There are many fast algorithms for solving SCPC [3, 2, 31], with open source code available for many of them.

Many real-time implementations are also proposed, and we adapt the \"sowing\" idea of [27], where L and E are relatively rarely updated, and their old values are used as a starting point for the update. In our application, we found updating L and E once a week yields almost identical results, since they are updated hourly. The calculation is embarrassingly exactly comparable to ours, and the calculation for the entire city for the period of 7 weeks took a small number of hours on a personal computer. There are many variants of SPCP, for example, with the use of the \"\u221e norm or Huber's penalty for the error matrix E, or with the use of the set of PCs 2-standard sum for the anomaly matrix A [6, 22]."}, {"heading": "3.

CONCLUSION", "text": "We use anonymized and aggregated cellular location data to measure urban mobility, and propose a scheme that breaks down traffic into expected traffic and anomalies caused by various reasons, with fine resolutions in time (hourly) and space (for each road). Our approach is fast, online, and extremely robust, even when anomalies are temporally and spatially linked, and when traffic is heterogeneous and difficult to parameterize. We adapt stable main component tracking to time series data, and provide normalized and interpretable quantifications of traffic expectations and anomalies that are comparable in time and spatial. We then group the anomalies at road level into anomalies in a diagram expansion process. We propose several ways to quantify the anomalies and quantify the impact on urban events. Given these quantifications of traffic expectations and anomalies, we can pinpoint emerging anomalies to traffic impacts as early as possible and in our space."}, {"heading": "5.

urban traffic is critical for real-time alerting or re-routing in the short run and urban planning in the long run. We describe a two-step framework that achieves these two goals in a robust, fast, online, and unsupervised manner. First, we adapt stable principal component pursuit to detect anomalies for each road segment. This allows us to pinpoint traffic anomalies early and precisely in space. Then we group the road-level anomalies across time and space into meaningful anomaly events using a simple graph expansion procedure. These events can be easily clustered, visualized, and analyzed by urban planners. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using 7 weeks of anonymized and aggregated cellular location data in Dallas\u2013Fort Worth. We suggest potential opportunities for urban planners and policy makers to use our methodology to make informed changes. These applications include real-time re-routing of traffic in response to abnormally high traffic, or identifying candidates for highimpact infrastructure projects.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
