Despite high accuracy achieved by face recognition algorithms under controlled conditions, achieving the same performance for face images obtained in surveillance scenarios, is a major hurdle. Some attempts have been made to super-resolve the low-resolution face images and improve the contrast, without considerable degree of success. The proposed technique in this paper tries to cope with the very low resolution and low contrast face images obtained from surveillance cameras, for FR under surveillance conditions. For Support Vector Machine classification, the selection of appropriate kernel has been a widely discussed issue in the research community. In this paper, we propose a novel kernel selection technique termed as MFKL (Multi-Feature Kernel Learning) to obtain the best feature-kernel pairing. Our proposed technique employs a effective kernel selection by Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) method, to choose the optimal kernel to be used along with unsupervised domain adaptation method in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), for a solution to the problem. Rigorous experimentation has been performed on three real-world surveillance face datasets : FR\\_SURV, SCface and ChokePoint. Results have been shown using Rank-1 Recognition Accuracy, ROC and CMC measures. Our proposed method outperforms all other recent state-of-the-art techniques by a considerable margin.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 18:22:03 GMT  (8678kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00660v1", "13 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables.

PROPOSED FRAMEWORK", "text": "The proposed framework, as shown in Figure 1, has been designed to deal with the problem of FR at low resolution and low contrast, with several people not learning [6] and DA. The stages are discussed in the following figures: A) The pre-processing phase of the images therefore appears with background and noise, pre-processing of the images is always necessary before they are passed on to the feature extraction stage. This treatment of the images is referred to as the pre-processing phase, as shown in Figure 2 and described in the following step by step: 1) Robust face recognition The gallery and the probe images are guided by the Chehra face tracker [4], which uses a cascade linear regression for discriminatory facial alignment. The incremental updating of the cascade of linear regression is a very challenging task, as the results must be propagated from one level to the next. Due to this sequential nature of the training method we refer to this cascade of Monte Carlo regression as a method."}, {"heading": "E. Classification based on K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier", "text": "In the test phase, as shown in Figure 6, a low resolution image is first pre-processed using the pre-processing techniques described in Section IV-A. The features are extracted from the pre-processed probe and transmitted to the DA module (RKHS), as shown in Figure 6. The process of core selection corresponding to a feature is based on the MFKL technique proposed in the core selection phase. For each of these features, the entire gram matrix is created."}, {"heading": "V.

authentication. Despite high accuracy achieved by face recognition algorithms under controlled conditions, achieving the same performance for face images obtained in surveillance scenarios, is a major hurdle. Some attempts have been made to super-resolve the low-resolution face images and improve the contrast, without considerable degree of success. The proposed technique in this paper tries to cope with the very low resolution and low contrast face images obtained from surveillance cameras, for FR under surveillance conditions. For Support Vector Machine classification, the selection of appropriate kernel has been a widely discussed issue in the research community. In this paper, we propose a novel kernel selection technique termed as MFKL (Multi-Feature Kernel Learning) to obtain the best feature-kernel pairing. Our proposed technique employs a effective kernel selection by Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) method, to choose the optimal kernel to be used along with unsupervised domain adaptation method in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), for a solution to the problem. Rigorous experimentation has been performed on three real-world surveillance face datasets : FR SURV [33], SCface [20] and ChokePoint [44]. Results have been shown using Rank-1 Recognition Accuracy, ROC and CMC measures. Our proposed method outperforms all other recent state-of-the-art techniques by a considerable margin.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
