Arguments are the \"slots\" that need to be filled to satisfy the value of a verb (subject, object, etc.) In previous work, e.g. Montemagni et al. (1995), lexical sentences were collected manually and compared by quantity analysis; the degree of similarity between two sentences was proportional to the extent of their intersection; we believe that possible improvements may stem from deriving the lexical sentences and exploiting the semantic information of the pens. In this work, we develop a causal method from a huge corpus and use a distributive word."}, {"heading": "1.1 Word Embedding", "text": "Recently, efficient algorithms have been developed that map each word of a vocabulary ar Xiv: 161 0.00 765v 1 [cs.C L] 3O ct2 016lary into a corresponding vector of n real numbers that can be thought of as a coordinate sequence in n-dimensional space (Mikolov et al., 2013).This mapping results from unattended machine learning, based on the assumption that the meaning of a word can be derived from its context, i.e. its adjacent words in texts. This model has some relevant properties: the geometric proximity of two vectors corresponds to the similarity in the meaning of the corresponding words. Furthermore, its dimensions may have a semantic interpretation."}, {"heading": "1.2 Causative-Inchoative Alternation", "text": "One possible test of the usefulness of presenting the argument filler as a vector is the verbs that exhibit the so-called causative-inchoative alternation, which appear either as transitive or intransitive; in the first case, an agent leads to a change of state; in the second, the change of a patient is presented as spontaneous (e.g. to break, as in \"Mary broke the key\" vs. \"broke the key\"); the two alternative forms of these verbs can be morphologically asymmetrical: in this case, one has a derivative affix and the other is not; the first is marked here as \"fundamental,\" the second as \"fundamental.\" Italian verbs with asymmetrical alternation derive from the phenomenon of the anti-causative form; the intransitive form is marked by the intransitive form, as it sometimes precedes the climatic form si (Cennamo and Jezek, 2011)."}, {"heading": "2 Previous Work", "text": "In the literature, there are many methods available for automatic detection of verb classes, such as causative-inchoative verbs, which use characteristics based on reasoning changes, such as sub-categorization frameworks (Joanis et al., 2008). The identification of verb classes that exhibit diathesis changes was also done by analyzing selective preferences, in particular lexical terms were compared using distribution semantics (McCarthy et al., 2000). These characteristics were usually induced from automatic parses of heterogeneous and broad corpora (Schulte Im Walde, 2000). Specifically, the extraction of sub-categorization frameworks, including noise filters based on frequency (Korhonen et al., 2000), has been inspired by these attempts to induce automatically lexical information related to verbs, but their research direction is reversed."}, {"heading": "3 Data and Method", "text": "The data were taken from a sample of ItWac, a broad Italian corpus collected by Web-Crawling (Baroni et al., 2009), which was enriched with morphosyntactic information and filtered by sentence length (< 100) by the MATE Tools parser (Bohnet, 2010) 1, and finally the sentences in the sample amounted to 2,029,454 items. A target group of 20 causative-inchoative verbs were taken from Haspelmath (1993), which are listed here from the least spontaneous to the most: close > open > open > open > fill > collect > split > open > ascend > climb > stone > burn > freeze > dry > boil > sinking The extraction step consisted in identifying their argument fillers within the judgments in the sample. Specifically, the arguments under consideration were subjected to subjects of inrelevant objectives (1994, 751) and (O)."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "In order to bring to light the information hidden in the automatically extracted lexical sets, we developed two experiments. One examines the internal structure of lexical sets. In fact, previous work based on set theory treated them as categorical sets whose filler is either a member or not. Research in psychology, on the other hand, has long shown that the members of a linguistic set are found in a radial continuum in which most central sets are the prototype for their category, and those on the periphery are less representative (Rosch, 1973; Lakoff, 1987). Word vectors allow these spatial values to be captured. Once the fillers have been mapped to their respective vectors, a lexical set appears as a group of points in a multidimensional model. The center of this group is the Euclidean center of vectors, which is a vector itself and is called a centroid."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "The presentation of lexical sentences of Italian causative-inchoative verbs as vectors, however, provided insights into their internal structure and their relationship to spontaneity. An alternative measure was considered for the ranking: the cardinality of the S-O intersection weighted by the set union. This difference cannot be due to frequency, since both arguments share their discursive function of introducing new referents (Du Bois, 1985). Furthermore, the medians of the distances of subject fillers seem to be more different from their centrifuge. One interpretation is that they are sensitive to the frequency scale: this implies that often transitive (i.e. non-spontaneous) verbs have a manically less homogeneous reference set, since they depend on the discovery of macro factors that cannot be linked to the fact."}], "references": [{"title": "The wacky wide web: a collection of very large linguistically processed web-crawled corpora", "author": ["Baroni et al.2009] Marco Baroni", "Silvia Bernardini", "Adriano Ferraresi", "Eros Zanchetta"], "venue": "Language resources and evaluation,", "citeRegEx": "Baroni et al\\.,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baroni et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Very high accuracy and fast dependency parsing is not a contradiction", "author": ["Bernd Bohnet"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics,", "citeRegEx": "Bohnet.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bohnet.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "The anticausative alternation in italian", "author": ["Cennamo", "Jezek2011] Michela Cennamo", "Elisabetta Jezek"], "venue": "I luoghi della traduzione,", "citeRegEx": "Cennamo et al\\.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Cennamo et al\\.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Improving zero-shot learning by mitigating the hubness problem. workshop contribution at ICLR", "author": ["Dinu et al.2015] Georgiana Dinu", "Angeliki Lazaridou", "Marco Baroni"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Dinu et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dinu et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Improving vector space word representations using multilingual correlation", "author": ["Faruqui", "Dyer2014] Manaal Faruqui", "Chris Dyer"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Faruqui et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Faruqui et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Retrofitting word vectors to semantic lexicons", "author": ["Jesse Dodge", "Sujay K.
