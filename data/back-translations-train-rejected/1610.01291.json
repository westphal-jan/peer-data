Our experiments are made in the framework of the Metrics task of WMT 2014.

METEOR-NEXT proposes to go beyond mere word-to-word alignment by using phrase-to-phrase alignments, using phrase databases for different languages such as English (Snover et al., 2009), German, French or Czech (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010b).

If word vectors are available, a similarity between two words can be measured using a metric such as a cosmic similarity. The use of word embedding for machine translation evaluation is appealing as it can be used to calculate similarities between words or phrases in the same language (monolingual embedding capture synonymic or morphological proximity) or in two different languages (bilingual embedding allows direct calculation between words or phrases in the same language)."}, {"heading": "2.3.2 Use of vector representations in NLP evaluation", "text": "Zou et al.

(Banchs et al., 2015) suggested researching a metric based on latent semantic analysis (Salton et al., 1975) to extract semantic embeddings and measure the similarity between two sentences. Finally, these word embeddings were used to enrich ROUGE, a metric for evaluating automatic summaries (Ng and Abrecht, 2015). Regarding MT evaluation, Gupta et al. (2015) proposed a metric based on neural network language models along with dependency trees to link a hypothesis with a reference.

Indeed, the monolingual (base line) shown in Table 6 corresponds to the line METEOR Vector in Table 4.

We also try to train pseudo-bilingual embedding on a pseudo-bilingual bittext with target language text and POS tags (see an example in Table 5). The main idea is to link words strongly with their syntactic class when learning word embedding. We call this type of model bilingual embedding as pseudo-bilingual POS.

On the other hand, if we combine lexical data with vector module (METEOR DBnary + Vector), we find a small increase in correlation value, especially when adjusting thresholds, which results in a tunable version of METEOR. Finally, several embedding variants have been trained, but it seems that monolingual models are efficient enough for the specific task considered here (MT evaluation)."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Examples", "text": "To illustrate the word matching obtained by our versions of METEOR, we analyze two examples from the evaluation data set.

METEOR Baseline found only alignments for words with the same surface shapes (\"qu,\" \"il,\" \"est\" etc. - these forms are identical thanks to the Exact Module and are not highlighted here).The synonym module based on DBnary allows to find a match between words \"employ\u00e9es\" - \"utilis\u00e9es\" and \"dans\" -. \"Finally, Vector module points out that the words\" pense \"and\" testime \"are contextually closed, just like the words\" je \"and\" j \"\" are contextually linked with the V\u00e9r\u00e9ctor (if the METER Vector is only highlighted with the V\u00e9r\u00e9r\u00e9ctor)."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Limitations of Word Embeddings", "text": "By OOV we mean words that do not have vector representation because they have not been found in the training corpus for word embedding. In this case, there can be no correspondence between the word in the hypothesis and the words in the reference. Consequently, it might be interesting to carefully select the training corpus for word vectors so that it is close enough to the results of machine translation to evaluate them. This could be taken into account in future work."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Perspectives", "text": "Our work has been applied to the evaluation of machine translations and we have expanded an existing evaluation metric called METEOR. Our experiments have shown that word vector representations can be useful when there are no lexical resources available in the target language. Furthermore, it seems that these representations can provide additional information in addition to lexical resources (experiments being carried out for French, English, German and Russian as target languages).Our future work on this topic will focus on the use of phrase embeddings to supplement the METEOR paraphrase module. We also plan to introduce a syntax variant in our vector module by weighting cosmic distances differently according to the morphosyntactic category of words. Finally, we will examine the adaptation of our approach to other metrics such as TER-Plus to enable instance.The tool, data and models in this paper will be presented on the basis of 8 repeat lines."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the KEHATH project, which was funded by the French research agency ANR under the funding number ANR-14-CE24-0016-03."}], "references": [{"title": "METEOR-WSD: Improved Sense Matching in MT Evaluation.
