Certainly, the first part of the aphorism applies to the model presented here: apart from the inevitable shortcomings of a universal model based on the abstract concept of the \"phoneme,\" the final matrix has a number of limitations, such as the omission of tones and suprasegmental characteristics and an inconsistent treatment of phonemes. Indeed, this is a significant limitation of the matrix, while diphthongs are not. An even more consistent objection is that a uniform model is offered for applications in which two evaluation models are expected and needed."}], "references": [{"title": "Beyond the Comparative Method.", "author": ["Campbell", "Lyle"], "venue": "In Historical Linguistics", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2001}, {"title": "A Comparison of Worldwide Phonemic and Genetic Variation in Human Populations.", "author": ["Creanza", "Nicole", "Merritt Ruhlen", "Trevor J.
