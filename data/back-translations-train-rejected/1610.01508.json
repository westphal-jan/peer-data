Introduction", "text": "In this publication, we describe a language used to construct 3D visualizations, an object defined by natural language expressions, VoxML (Visual Object Concept Modeling Language), which is used as a platform for creating multimodal semantic simulations in the context of human-computer communication, and which has largely focused on object placement and orientation in static scenes (Coyne and Sproat, 2001; Chang et al., 2015), and we have attempted to integrate dynamic semantics and movement language into our model. In previous work (Pustejovsky and Krishnaswamy, 2014), we have developed a method for modeling natural language expressions within a 3D simulation environment, which has been evaluated on the game development platform Unity (Goldstone, 2009)."}, {"heading": "2. Habitats and Affordances", "text": "Before introducing the VoxML specification, we review our assumptions regarding the semantics underlying the model. Following the Generative Encyclopaedia (GL) (Pustejovsky, 1995), lexical entries in the object language are given a property structure consisting of the basic type of a word, its parameter listing, its event typing, and its qualification structure. The semantics of an object consists of the following elements: (1) a. Atomic Structure (FORMAL): Objects expressed as basic nominal types b. Subatomic Structure (CONST): mereotopological structure of objects c. Event Structure (TELIC and AGENTIVE) consists of the following elements: Origin and functions associated with an object d. Macro Object Structure: How objects fit together in space and through coordinated activites. Objects can be partially qualified by their structure c. Event Structure (TELIC and AGENTIVE) consists of the following elements: Origin and functions associated with an object d.

The VoxML Specification", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. VoxML Elements", "text": "Units modeled in VoxML can be objects, programs, or logical types. Objects are logical constants; programs are nary predicates that can take objects or other evaluated predicates as arguments; logical types can be subdivided into attributes, relationships, and functions, all predicates that take objects as arguments. Attributes and relationships evaluate states and functions evaluate geometric regions. These units can then be composed into visualizations of natural language concepts and expressions."}, {"heading": "3.2. Objects", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "3.3. Programs", "text": "PROGRAM is used to model verbs. The current set of PROGRAM attributes is presented below: LEX PROGRAM's lexical information TYPE PROGRAM's event, which types the embedding space of the PROGRAM as a unit of the participants and their temporal changes. Just like OBJECTs, the LEX attribute of a PROGRAM contains the subcomponents PRED, the predicate lexem that denotes the program, and TYPE, the program type that is specified in a lexical semantic resource, e.g. its GL type. TYPE contains the HEAD, its base form; ARGS, the reference to the participants; and BODY, all subitems that are executed during the program run. The highest values for the HEAD of a PROGRAM are specified below: HEAD state, process, transition assignment, test, action differentiation, as shown above, and the distinction of a program."}, {"heading": "3.4. Logical Types", "text": "Like OBJECTs and PROGRAMMES, all functional type classes contain an LEX attribute and a PRED parameter that denote the lexeme associated with the VoxML representation. The distinction between ATTRIBUTEs, RELATIONs, and FUNCTIONs consists mainly in differences in their TYPE structure, which are discussed in each subsection below."}, {"heading": "3.4.1. Attributes", "text": "Adjective modification and prediction include a reference to an ATTRIBUTE in our model, along with a specific value for that attribute. Often, but not always, this attribute is associated with a family of other attributes, structured according to a series of constraints that we call SCALE. The least constrained association is a conventional sortal classification, and its associated attribute family is the set of paired and non-overlapping sortal descriptions. Following (Stevens, 1946; Luce et al., 1990), we will designate this classification as a nominal scale, and it is the least restrictive scale domain through which we can perform individual predicataloguing. Binary classifications are a two-state subset of that range. If we impose more constraints on the values of an attribute, we will arrive at structured domains."}, {"heading": "3.4.2. Relations", "text": "The type structure of a RELATION specifies a binary CLASS of the relationship: configuration or force dynamics, which describes the nature of the relationship. These classes themselves have undervalues - for configurative relationships these are values from the regional calculation (Randell et al., 1992). Also specified are the arguments involved in the relationships, which are presented as typed variables as described above."}, {"heading": "3.4.3. Functions", "text": "REFERENT takes as ARG all the subparameters of the ARG that are semantically relevant to the function, such as the voxem voxem. If not specified, the entire voxem should be assumed as the referent. MAPPING is set to a designation of the type of transformation that performs the function over the object, such as dimension reduction (recorded as dimension (s): n-1 for a function that takes an object of n dimensions and returns a region of n-1). Finally, ORIENTATION returns three values: SPACE, which notes whether the function is performed in space or object space; AXIS, which records the primary axis and direction that the function uses; and ARITY, which is transitive or intransitive based on the Boolean value of a specified input variable ([y]: insidensitive for a function that returns transitives in transitive values)."}, {"heading": "4. Examples of Voxemes", "text": "In this section, we demonstrate the representation capabilities of the specification by briefly introducing sample voxeme entries from the current VoxML voxicon. VoxML OBJECT representations are intended to correspond with specific voxeme geometries, which are shown below. In cases where a representation instance is given independently of a geometry, it should be assumed that it denotes a prototype or \"default\" representation of the lexeme associated with the voxem."}, {"heading": "4.1.

Programs", "text": "Events are interpreted as programs that move an object or change an object property or relationship from state to state, as described in the next paragraph. The program structure is largely derived from the lexical semantics of the verb in GL. However, the semantics of predictive change versus the event structure is interpreted operationally. We illustrate this with two predicates as programs, slide and put. (7) Slide LEX = PRED = Slide TYPE = Process TYPE = HEAD = Process ARGS = A1 = x: Physobj A2 = y: Physobj BODY = E1 = while (EC (x, y), move (x)) (8) Put LEX = PRED = Put TYPE = Transition event TYPE = HEAD = Transition ARGS = A1 = x: A2 = y: Physobj BODY = E3 = z: Location BODY = E1 = mature (x) (y) (x), (y) (Ep) during (x)."}, {"heading": "4.3.

Using VoxML for Simulation Modeling of Language", "text": "VoxML deals with objects and events related to a dynamic event semantics, dynamic intervals temporal logic (DITL) (Pustejovsky and Moszkowicz, 2011).The advantage of a dynamic interpretation of events is that we can map linguistic expressions directly into simulations through operative semantics (Miller and Charles, 1991; Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976).Models of processes that use an actualization typically refer to the notion of a state transition (van Benthem, 1991; Harel, 1984) by distinguishing between formulas, results and programs, \u03c0. A formula is interpreted as a classical propositional expression, with assignment of a truth value in a specific model. For the current discussion, we represent the dynamics of actions related to Labeled Transition Systems (LTSs) (van Benthem, 1991).3 An LTS consists of a threefold, < S, Act >, where we determine the dynamics of actions."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have outlined a specification to represent semantic knowledge of real-world objects that are represented as three-dimensional models. We use a combination of parameters that can be determined by the geometric properties of the object, as well as lexical information from the natural language, using methods for correlating the two. This information allows the visualization and simulation software to supplement information that is missing in the input of the natural language, and allows the software to create a functional visualization of programs that are executed over objects in a robust and expandable manner. Currently, we have a voxicon with 500 object (noun) voxemes and 10 program (verb) voxemes. As our library of available voxemes continues to grow, the specification elements can also grow, allowing us to operate a larger library of different and more complex programs and to compose complex behaviors from simpler voxemes."}, {"heading": "7.
