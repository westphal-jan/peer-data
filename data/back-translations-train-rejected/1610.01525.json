The common distribution function of MRFs is given by Pr (x = x) = 1Z-f \u03c6f (x-f) (1), where x-f is a common allocation to all x variables, x-f is the respective common allocation to all xf variables under x, and Z stands for a normalization constant called the partition function.

The algorithm plans messages between adjacent nodes in the graphical models until the messages converge, thereby simultaneously calculating margins for all random variables in the model. Although BP does not guarantee to be able to converge in diagrams that contain loops, the method often comes to a reasonable set of approximations to the correct boundary distributions [7]. The result then corresponds to a stationary point of approximation to the free energy of Bethe. The Generalized Belief Propagation (GBP) algorithm is, as its name suggests, a generalization of the BP algorithm. GBP messages are sent from one cluster of variables to another, in a graphical structure called a regional diagram.

In exact conclusion, computational operators typically have to take into account the division of the model into isomorphic components [17]. In comparison, approximate inference methods [11, 3, 10] are able to use a more relaxed form of symmetry shown between clusters of MRF variables. [1] Although the term predicate is used, atoms are not limited to boolean assignments. Definition 1 cluster x\u03b1 and x\u03b1 \u2032 are considered symmetric if a structure exists that preserves permutation on the variables of the MRF (i.e. a permutation belonging to the automorphism group of the graphic model), under which each xi-x\u03b1 is mapped to a distinctive xj-x\u03b1 structure."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Cluster Signatures and Canonical Clusters", "text": "Let x\u03b1 denote a cluster of ground atoms obtained from the relational MRF Mr. The Cluster Signature Graph (CSG) of x\u03b1, the projection of its contents on a graph, in a way that guarantees two important properties: (i) If the CSGs of x\u03b1 and x\u03b1 \u2032 are isomorphic, then x\u03b1 and x\u03b1 \u2032 are symmetrical. (ii) The mapping induced by such isomorphism represents a structural permutation in the relational MRF. Due to lack of space, we present a simpler definition of CSG than that of [2], which covers slightly less symmetry and refers to fragmented models.

First, a compact regional graph is formed in the face of a relational MRF and a number of outer regions, consisting entirely of regions corresponding to canonical clusters. Second, an algorithm for message delivery is used that is specially adapted to the raised graph and produces exactly the same result as the ground GBP. We begin with a brief overview of the raised framework."}, {"heading": "4.1 Lifted GBP \u2013 An Overview", "text": "Imagine a regional graph for the relational MRF \u03c6 (p (X), q (Y) \u03b2 | X 6 = Y), where all pairs {pi, qj} (i 6 = j) serve as outer regions. Such a graph can be achieved by finding all intersections induced by the {pi, qj} pairs, and defining two edges from each pair to its members: {pi, qj} and {pi, qj} \u2192 qj. However, the highly symmetrical character of the regional graph allows to grasp its structure much more precisely, via a representation that simulates the description given above. First, we define symmetry in the context of the regional graphs. Regions \u03b1 and \u03b1 \u2032 will be symmetrical if there is a permutation. R on the regional graph there are nodes that preserve its structure, and under which ratios R (\u03b1) symmetry of the relative regions is derived directly."}, {"heading": "4.2 Symmetry-Preserving Properties", "text": "The superseded GBP framework is based on two symmetrically oriented properties. The first is that symmetry-preserving permutations for the regional graph are derived from the common structure of the MRF and the group of selected outer regions. The second property formalizes the symmetry that preserves the nature of the flood plan and allows a compact representation of the flow of messages. Formally, Theorem 1 Let it designate a series of outer regions for MRF M. and let GR designate a regional graph obtained by iterative intersections. Then, any permutation of M's variables that preserves the structure of both B and M causes a permutation of R that, when applied to the regional graph's nodes, preserves its structure. Theorem 2 Let G designate a graph, and let \u03c0 R be a structure that preserves permutation on the nodes of the graph."}, {"heading": "4.3 Generating the Lifted Region Graph", "text": "Before generating the graph, we must choose which outer regions represent the represented regions. A natural pick would be all regions with a circumference corresponding to the factors in the soil. The added value of this pick is that, if carefully constructed, each soil instance of a perffactor corresponds to a circumference of any canonical cluster. Specifically, if an X! = Y constraint is injected for each pair of lvars X, Y in the model, and the model is disrupted accordingly, the canonical outer regions can be selected without any computational effort. We continue with a formal definition of the raised region. Definition 3 A raised Regional Graph GR = (V, E, N) is a direct cyclic multigraph with nodes in V denoted regions, oriented edges in E denoted regions parents to child relationships associating any function that associates each edge with an image of the child to those of the parents."}, {"heading": "4.4 Computing the Parent-Child Cardinality", "text": "The cardinality of the edge is the number of all clusters in the relational MRF that are mapped to x\u03b1 in a structure that maintains the permutation, while all members of the edge are mapped to themselves. Thus, in models with objects of the N domain, where n\u03b22We indicate that the procedure under this chosen formulation can produce an upscale regional graph consisting of non-intersecting areas that serve only as targets for a single directed edge and whose cardinality is equal to 1. Alternatively, such regions can be removed from the graph by connecting their parents directly to their children. It is the number of objects referenced in the cluster x\u03b2, and n\u03b1\\ \u03b2 is the number of domain objects in x\u03b2 that are not referenced by x\u03b2, the cardinality is the number of objects that are referenced in the cluster x\u03b2."}, {"heading": "4.5 Lifted Message Passing", "text": "The key to the formation of the messages is that the different descendants of a region (e.g. region), although they may be members of the same symmetry class, may not be derived from one to the other. Each belief is derived from the structure of the graph raised and the internal structure of the region. The reason for this mixture is that the different descendants of a region (e.g. region), although they may be members of the same symmetry class, may not be attributable to the other. To overcome this obstacle, we define the concept of a local graph that cancels the maps on itself. Subsets of the graph raised that are symmetrical w.r.t. The global structure can still influence the state of belief in a non-symmetrical state. To overcome this obstacle, we define the concept of a local graph of the canonical region."}, {"heading": "5 Empirical Evaluation", "text": "We conducted experiments with 4 structurally distinctive relationship models: the first model is a friend-smoker model (i.e. friends (X, Y), smokers (X) = smokers (Y), the second is a transitive model [2], the third is a transitive friend-white model [1], and the fourth is the chain model whose regional diagrams are shown in Figure 1. Graphic isomorphism tests were performed with the NetworkX package [6]. The time required to create the upscale diagrams was found to be in the range of tens of milliseconds. In all experiments, we performed 500 iterations of uplifted GBP messages, which were performed with a damping factor of 0.5 and the normalization of both beliefs and messages. Messages were performed in the protocol room to maintain numerical stability. Time performance and query results were normalized with the WFOMC [CBP] motor [querified for the position of the GBP], as well as the GBP [queried for the position of the GBP] were not calculated."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "Although the scope of this work is limited to summary product queries, the compact formulation of the upscale regional graph can serve other algorithms based on a similar structure. An aspect worth investigating is the extension of the scope of outer regions, not only to first-order regions, but also to all regions of a given size, similar to lifting and project hierarchies [15]. Such experiments can lead to streamlined results and improved convergence in highly complex models."}], "references": [{"title": "Exploiting uniform assignments in first-order MPE", "author": ["U.
