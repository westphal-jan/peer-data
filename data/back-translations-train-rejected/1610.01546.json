For example, a pair [type = latte] describes the type of coffee ordered by the user as \"latte.\" After each statement by the user, the prediction of the user's intention and the state tracking component must accurately predict and update the current user's intention and the state he is in. The state includes all the slot value pairs that the agent has so far received from the user, such as [food = Japanese, location = 95070]. Without requiring hand labeled data for each statement by the user, we developed a new, uncontrolled learning method to train the models used by this component. Our approach is to train a deep learning model [2] that learns from delayed rewards that orders are collected at the end of each business's commercial rewards."}, {"heading": "2.2 Personalized recommendation and learning", "text": "Recommendation in conversations is an open area for research. In addition to the transaction history and demographic information of the user, which is normally used in traditional recommendation engines, our machine also has a range of additional information about the user's needs, such as a possible initial request from the user (i.e. a user query) or additional information collected during the conversation with the user. To better serve the users in our system, we have a recommendation system that is able to use this information to evaluate products, generate recommendations, receive user feedback, update the store and actively request additional user feedback."}, {"heading": "2.3 Machine utterance generation", "text": "We will demonstrate two mechanisms for generating machine expressions within our system: the first is a template-based model with a statistical learning method for selecting a template and automatically adding the missing components in the selected template for each request to generate machine expressions; the second solution is based on a deep learning model (i.e. a sequence model for generating language sequences)."}, {"heading": "3. DATA", "text": "We trained the model with untagged data collected from a mobile app that provides personalized assistance to thousands of daily active users.
