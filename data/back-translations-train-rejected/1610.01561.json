INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, most of these organizations rely on a situational awareness that they have based on the way they have behaved in recent years, on the way they have behaved. (For example, in order to better understand the severity and status of an event, most of these organizations depend on a situational perception that divides them into different categories, such as infrastructure damage to important infrastructure around airports, bridges, buildings, communications infrastructure, etc.) The first step in extracting situational information from these tweets involves classifying them into different information categories, such as infrastructure damage, animal welfare, etc., etc., etc., etc. The author was at the Computing Research Institute, Doha, Qatar.needs or offers, relief supplies, etc. For example, one such application, AIDR [9] classifies Twitter messages into different categories in real time."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "However, aid agencies can plan more effectively if they have access to important information from the tweets [12].Kedzie et al. [11] proposed an extractive method of summarizing tweets to summarize catastrophic event-specific information from news articles. In contrast, several researchers have tried to use information from Twitter to retrieve important situational updates from millions of posts on catastrophic specific events [21]. However, more recently, complex methods of automatically generating summaries by extracting the most important tweets about the event [20] have been proposed. To generate real-time summaries, some approaches to online summarization of tweet streams have been proposed recently [20].The above methods generate extractive summaries that are merely a collection of tweets. Ideally, we prefer an abstract summary of important content from tweets rather than the entire tweets. Such a summary should also be more readable than a collection of tweets."}, {"heading": "3. DATASET AND CLASSIFICATION OF MESSAGES", "text": "We use the Twitter data of the Nepal Earthquake 2015 from CrisisNLP [10]. The data set consists of 27 million messages from April 25 to 27, which were compiled using various keywords (e.g. Nepal Earthquake, NepalQuake, NepalQuakeRelief, NepalEarthquake, KathmanduQuake, QuakeNepal, EarthquakeNepal, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, etc.). In this work, we selected AIDR [9] classified messages from three categories for which machine confidence was \u2265 0.80. The selected classes and messages in each of the three classes are: 1. Missing, buried or found persons: 10,751 2. Infrastructure and utilities: 16,842 3. Shelter and Supplies: 19,006 messages."}, {"heading": "4.

IDENTIFICATION OF SUB-TOPICS AND SUMMARIZATION", "text": "In this section, we cover sub-events / topics that have been classified into a specific category (e.g. infrastructure damage). We define a sub-topic as a combination of a noun and a verb in which noun represents a concept and a verb represents an event (as described in the previous section). In this section, we look for dependency relationships between nounsand verbs that are important to declare some information as an event / topic. Table 3 provides examples of some sub-topic phrases from different AIDR classes. These sub-topics show important but very specific events after the major earthquake crisis."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "We have presented a new framework to summarize information in crisis-related tweets in two different forms: (a) a general summary of the situation and (b) specific reports on the activity of flashpoints that provide trenchant information about a location and / or event. To paint such a diverse but coherent picture, a deep understanding of the tweets posted during such a scenario is required - we believe that the series of innovations that have been made in this work was the result of a thorough analysis of such tweets. We have also conducted extensive evaluations using experts to determine the benefits of our approach, and in the future we will deploy the system in a way that can be helpful in future disaster events."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "K.
