There are many effective methods for signature verification taking into account dynamics of a signing process. Methods based on partitioning take a very important place among them. In this paper we propose a new approach to signature partitioning. Its most important feature is the possibility of selecting and processing of hybrid partitions in order to increase a precision of the test signature analysis. Partitions are formed by a combination of vertical and horizontal sections of the signature. Vertical sections correspond to the initial, middle, and final time moments of the signing process. In turn, horizontal sections correspond to the signature areas associated with high and low pen velocity and high and low pen pressure on the surface of a graphics tablet. Our previous research on vertical and horizontal sections of the dynamic signature (created independently) led us to develop the algorithm presented in this paper. Selection of sections, among others, allows us to define the stability of the signing process in the partitions, promoting signature areas of greater stability (and vice versa). In the test of the proposed method two databases were used: public MCYT-100 and paid BioSecure.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 19:32:55 GMT  (591kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01578v1", "34 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "34 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["krzysztof cpalka", "marcin zalasinski", "leszek rutkowski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01578"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.01578.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A new algorithm for identity verification based on the analysis of a handwritten dynamic signature", "authors": ["Krzysztof Cpa\u0142ka", "Marcin Zalasi\u0144ski", "Leszek Rutkowski"], "emails": ["krzysztof.cpalka@iisi.pcz.pl", "marcin.zalasinski@iisi.pcz.pl", "leszek.rutkowski@iisi.pcz.pl"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this paper, we propose a new approach to signature splitting.

Detailed description of the algorithm", "text": "The proposed algorithm for verifying dynamic signatures on the basis of hybrid partitioning operates in two phases (see Fig. 1): the training phase (Section 2.1) and the testing phase (Section 2.2). In both phases, a process for normalizing the signature is carried out (see Fig. 2). In this process, the most typical reference signature, the so-called base signature, is selected for each user. It is one of the reference signatures collected in the capture phase, where the distance to the other reference signatures is the smallest, and the distance is calculated according to the distance measure used (e.g. Euclidean).The training or test signatures are matched with the base signature using the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (see e.g. [41, 42, 43]), which works on the basis of matching speed and pressure signals. The result of the match of the two points of the corresponding signature is a land map."}, {"heading": "2.1. Training phase", "text": "Partitioning of each user's reference signatures is realized at the beginning of the training phase (Section 2.1.1). Partitions are hybrid because they are created from a combination of vertical and horizontal sections. Vertical sections are time intervals that specify the initial, middle and last phase of the signature. Horizontal sections are created in each vertical section taking into account the dynamics of a signature. If the velocity signal is first partitioned (order of signal processing is arbitrary), then the average value of the velocity is determined in each time interval (mean of the discrete values of the velocity). Next, in each internal two partitions, one of the signatures associated with the velocity is lower than the other associated with the average signature and (b) the other signature associated with the velocity is higher than the average."}, {"heading": "2.1.1.

Signal xi, j = [xi, j, k = 1, xi, j, k = 2,.,.., xi, j, k = Ki] describes the movement of the pen in two-dimensional space where Ki is the number of signal samples. The number of samples Ki results from the sampling frequency of the chart and the performance of the DTW algorithm in the normalization phase. Thanks to the signature, all trajectories describing the user's signatures are i = 2, the number of samples Ki. Movement of the pen along the y axis can be described in a similar way."}, {"heading": "2.1.2. Generation of the templates", "text": "The following parameters are taken into account when determining reference signature templates: (a) all J reference signatures of the user i, (b) two form gradients of the reference signatures, i.e. xi, j and yi, j and (c) partitions created for the reference signature resulting from the intersection of the vertical (by pv {s} i) and horizontal (by ph {s} i) (Fig. 4) reference signatures. The templates of the signatures are averaged fragments of the reference signatures represented by the form gradients xi, j or yi, j. The number of templates generated for the user corresponds to the number of partitions.

(1) The parameters of the system must be selected individually for each user from the database. (1) The signature verification algorithm should: (a) work independently of the number of users (its accuracy should not depend on the number of users in the database), (b) have the ability to simply add the signatures of new users, (c) do not take into account the signatures of other users in the training and verification phase of the signature. This limits the use of known methods e.g. from the field of non-linear classification and machine learning (evolutionary or gradient). In this paper we propose a new structure of flexible neuro-fuzzy single-class classification, the parameters of which depend on the reference signatures descriptors.

Results for all users were averaged. In each of the five repetitions, we used a different set of training signatures. The described method is commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods for dynamic signature verification, which corresponds to the standard cross-validation procedure. The method of selecting the reference and test signatures for each user was as follows: - During the training phase, we used 5 randomly selected original signatures from each signatory. These signatures were used to partition, determine the templates and calculate the parameters of the system for evaluating the test signatures resemblance to the reference signatures. - During the test phase, we used 15 real signatures and 15 forged signatures for the MCYT-100 database. For the BioSecure 10 database, we used 10 remaining signatures."}, {"heading": "3.2.

These errors are used in the literature to evaluate the effectiveness of biometric methods and have been determined for a different number of partitions. Other (less popular) yardsticks of effectiveness of biometric methods can also be used (e.g. those described in [56]), but in this case it would be difficult to compare the results obtained with the results of other authors. - Comparison of the accuracy of different methods for verifying the signature for the MCYT-100 database is presented in Table 3 and for the BioSecure database in Table 5. It is also worth noting that Table 1 represents the main features of the algorithms for online signature verification. - Weights of importance of the MCYT database are presented for weighting the Mig-7."}, {"heading": "3.3. Computational complexity", "text": "The proposed algorithm does not require a high level of computational complexity (Table 6), since it does not require machine learning and does not employ iterative procedures. Similarly, the methods proposed in our previous work (see e.g. [22, 23]) do not require a high level of computational complexity, but contain an iterative procedure for selecting the so-called limit of the reception of reference signatures. Eliminating this procedure from the proposed algorithm required a change in the approach to evaluating the similarity of the test signature with the reference signatures. The low complexity of our algorithm is very important for verifying the authenticity of the test signature, allowing the system to immediately consider the signatures of new users, achieved by eliminating machine learning, which normally requires anti-pattern (in signature verification, they are descriptors of false signatures represented, for example, by real signatures of other users)."}, {"heading": "3.4. Conclusions from the simulations", "text": "The proposed algorithm can be evaluated as follows: - For both considered databases, it obtained the highest accuracy in case of division of the signature into two partitions with moments of signature (first and final) (see table 2 and table 4). By analyzing the results presented in table 2 and table 4, it can also be seen that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm does not result from increasing the number of sections. - It allows to select the partitions of the signature in which the reference signatures were created in the most stable manner. These partitions had the highest weight value and the lowest value of the parameters describing the differences between the reference signatures and the templates in the partitions. It is associated with the lowest tolerance in evaluating the similarity of the test signatures with the reference signatures. For the MCYT-100 database, it was the partition associated with the shape curve x, the initial time of the signature, the signature."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a new algorithm for dynamic signature verification by partitioning, which uses signals that are available as standard in graphics tablets. It can also be easily adapted to the specific capabilities of the hardware used, e.g. standard device with touch screen, which is not a graphic tablet. Created partitions are linked to the areas of signature that are characterized by: high and low spring speed and high and low spring pressure on the surface of the graphics tablet at the beginning, middle and end of the signature process. The algorithm assigns importance weights to the partitions, which are used to evaluate the similarity of test signatures with reference signatures. Evaluation is done using the new flexible fuzzy system for the evaluation of signature similarity. It uses clear fuzzy rules that allow us to interpret the operation of the system and the parameters of the system are analytically determined."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The project was funded by the National Science Centre (Poland) on the basis of Decision No DEC-2012 / 05 / B / ST7 / 02138."}], "references": [{"title": "Dynamic selection of generative discriminative ensembles for off-line signature verification", "author": ["L.

on authenticity assessment of a handwritten signature is an important issue in biometrics. There are many effective methods for signature verification taking into account dynamics of a signing process. Methods based on partitioning take a very important place among them. In this paper we propose a new approach to signature partitioning. Its most important feature is the possibility of selecting and processing of hybrid partitions in order to increase a precision of the test signature analysis. Partitions are formed by a combination of vertical and horizontal sections of the signature. Vertical sections correspond to the initial, middle, and final time moments of the signing process. In turn, horizontal sections correspond to the signature areas associated with high and low pen velocity and high and low pen pressure on the surface of a graphics tablet. Our previous research on vertical and horizontal sections of the dynamic signature (created independently) led us to develop the algorithm presented in this paper. Selection of sections, among others, allows us to define the stability of the signing process in the partitions, promoting signature areas of greater stability (and vice versa).
