Starting with the model from (Pustejovsky and Moszkowicz, 2011), we analyze motion events using temporally-traced Labelled Transition Systems. We model the distinction between path- and manner-motion in an operational semantics, and further distinguish different types of manner-of-motion verbs in terms of the mereo-topological relations that hold throughout the process of movement. From these representations, we generate minimal models, which are realized as three-dimensional simulations in software developed with the game engine, Unity. The generated simulations act as a conceptual \"debugger\" for the semantics of different motion verbs: that is, by testing for consistency and informativeness in the model, simulations expose the presuppositions associated with linguistic expressions and their compositions. Because the model generation component is still incomplete, this paper focuses on an implementation which maps directly from linguistic interpretations into the Unity code snippets that create the simulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 01:56:23 GMT  (2904kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01713v1", "11 pages, 5 figures, *SEM workshop, COLING 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 5 figures, *SEM workshop, COLING 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["james pustejovsky", "nikhil krishnaswamy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01713"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.01713.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Generating Simulations of Motion Events from Verbal Descriptions", "authors": ["James Pustejovsky", "Nikhil Krishnaswamy"], "emails": ["jamesp@cs.brandeis.edu", "nkrishna@brandeis.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Reports of the Third Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (* SEM 2014), pp. 99-109, Dublin, Ireland, 23-24 August 2014."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is as if most people are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they don't want.

Due to their grammatical and semantic import, linguistic interest in the identification of events has largely focused on verbs of motion and the role of paths. Jackendoff (1983), for example, develops a semantics for movement bans that explicitly refer to the path traversed by the movement, from source to destination (destination) sites. Talmy (1983) develops a similar conceptual template in which the figure is integrated to sign the movement against a ground. Therefore, the path can be identified as a central element in defining the event (Talmy, Talmy, 2000)."}, {"heading": "3 Modeling Motion in Language", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Theoretical Assumptions", "text": "The advantage of a dynamic interpretation of movement is that we can distinguish the train prediction directly from the type of movement prediction in an operative semantic (Miller and Charles, 1991; Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976), which relates well to a simulation environment.

Levin (1993) distinguishes this class in terms of argumentative alternation patterns and identifies the following verb groups: ROLL, RUN, EPONYMOUS VEHICLE, WALTZ, ACCOMPANY and CHASE verbs. While these distinctions are only partially useful in actually distinguishing the semantic dimensions along which we identify the contributing factors of man. Mani and Pustejovsky (2012) suggest a different strategy that involves identifying semantic parameters that clearly distinguish verb sensations from each other. One parameter is fairly comprehensively exploited within the motion class, which involves mereotopological contrasts running through the movement of the object (Randell et al)."}, {"heading": "4 Simulations as Minimal Models", "text": "The approach of simulation construction presented in the previous section is inspired by work on minimal modeling (Blackburn and Bos, 2008; Konrad, 2004). Satisfaction with the compositional process reflects the component of the theorem proof, while the construction of the specific model helps us distinguish what is inherent in the different types of motion behavior, the latter aspect being the \"positive grip\" (Blackburn and Bos, 2008), which demonstrates the informativeness of a distinction in our simulation. Simulation software must be able to represent a predictor of a known behavior, its arguments against objects in the scene, and then induce those objects to perform the behavior. A simple input set requires that real synonyms in the lexicon would not be distinguishable from a model."}, {"heading": "5 Generating Simulations", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to put themselves in a situation where they are able, in which they are able to survive, in which they are able, and in which they are able, in which they are able to assert themselves."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank David McDonald for comments and discussions, and we would also like to thank the reviewers for some significant suggestions for improvement and clarification of the essay.

From these representations, we generate minimal models, which are realized as three-dimensional simulations in software developed with the game engine, Unity. The generated simulations act as a conceptual \u201cdebugger\u201d for the semantics of different motion verbs: that is, by testing for consistency and informativeness in the model, simulations expose the presuppositions associated with linguistic expressions and their compositions.
