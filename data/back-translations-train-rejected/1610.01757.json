Deep architecture requires a low learning rate and much more time to train. It is difficult to train models with saturating nonlinearity on deep neural architecture.This condition is called an internal covariate layer problem. One of the techniques used to solve this problem is the normalization input level. As mentioned on [7], the main goal of batch normalization is to achieve a stable distribution of activation values during the training. Batch normalization applies normalization techniques for each training minibatch.For general algorithm steps of batch normalization according to (2) to (7).For each equation, we represent every aspect of the normalization process.

The age range of the data objects is between 29 and 72 years, 37 people male and 25 people female. In this study, we also assisted two neurologists in diagnosing the EEG signal and the stroke severity of the patient. For each recording, the task took a total of 15 minutes. For each EEG measurement, there are five event channels. Events include: open eyes without stimulation, closed eyes without stimulation and closed eyes with a flash of light stimulation in three variants of frequencies (5 Hz, 10 Hz and 15 Hz). The sampling rate was used for recording with Xltek: EZ 5, EZ 5, EZ 5, EZ 5, EZ 5."}, {"heading": "3.2 Preprocessing", "text": "From the literature it is known that the ischemic stroke is caused by obstruction. Obstruction results in the CBF value of the stroke patient being much lower than the CBF value of a normal person. Low CBF values have an influence on the deceleration of the EEG signal of stroke patients. Therefore, the focus of the analysis of the EEG signals should be on the slow wave signals. Several other studies analyzing the frequency bands include four large waves with band frequencies below 30 Hz (1 \u2212 4Hz delta, 4 \u2212 8Hz theta, 8 \u2212 12Hz alpha and 12 \u2212 30Hz beta). The lowest sampling rate in the EEG recording in our study is 256 Hz. With the sampling rate of 256Hz, we can obtain PSD from the band frequency between 0 Hz and 128Hz alpha, which of course supports the action to make the EEG stroke data different from the EEG control of the EEG method (to the 61er and to the 61er)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Feature Extraction", "text": "After pre-processing the data, we move on to the feature extraction phase.

This size is too small if we used a k-fold cross-validation scenario with a limited number of k. In this situation, we use Leave One Out (LOO) cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of each classifier in experiments.The LOO scenario specified a scheme: one data as a test and the other data as a training in each round. In this study, each round has 1 data object as a data test and the remaining 61 data objects as training data. This condition was repeated 62 laps, so that for each time recorded in test data and 61 times as training data. In our evaluation, this 62 times LOO (full round) was repeated five times.

Table I shows the performance parameter results for each epoch and all of the comparator classifiers. Increasing epoch value accompanied by improvements in the performance parameter values of 1DCNN. From the experiment with epoch 100 and epoch 200, we get the average accuracy results are 0.829 and 0.861. These results obtain an improvement in accuracy to compare the best performance of the comparator (just 0.69, Naive Bayes).

In this study, we apply techniques of early stop and batch normalization to speed up the training process of our classification model. 1DCNN's leave-one-out scenario achieved an average accuracy of 0.86 (F score 0.861 and precision 0.870), which was achieved in just 200 epochs and using a 24 \"handcrafted\" function that focused on four channels, 2 EEG channels and 2 EOG channels. Comparing the best result with a flat classifier (Naive Bayes), 1DCNN achieves an improvement of about 16.8%.
