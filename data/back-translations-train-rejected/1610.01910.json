Many approaches understandably use subjective categories which are more fine-grained than a straightforward polarity-based spectrum. However, the definition of such categories is non-trivial and, in fact, we argue for a need to incorporate communicative elements even beyond subjectivity. To support our position, we report experiments on a sentiment-labelled corpus of posts taken from a medical support forum. We argue that not only is a more fine-grained approach to text analysis important, but simultaneously recognising the social function behind affective expressions enable a more accurate and valuable level of understanding.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 15:23:31 GMT  (188kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01910v1", "9 pages, 1 figure, conference workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 1 figure, conference workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["amit navindgi", "caroline brun", "c\\'ecile boulard masson", "scott nowson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01910"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.01910.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Toward Automatic Understanding of the Function of Affective Language in Support Groups", "authors": ["Amit Navindgi", "Caroline Brun", "C\u00e9cile Boulard Masson"], "emails": ["navindgi@usc.edu", "@xrce.xerox.com", "scott.nowson@accenture.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 161 0.01 910v 1 [cs.C L] 6O ct2 016"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "There is an abundance of opinions on the Internet. The accessibility bar has been reduced to an even larger audience that can now share its voice. However, more than just opinions on external matters, people are able to share their emotions and feelings and talk openly about very personal matters. In fact, these emotions are only partially able to increase anonymity in the online presence, while all authors are able to follow the interactions face to face (Hancock et al., 2007). The forums are a platform on which users generate emotional content."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In fact, it is a very selective group, which is able to see itself as being able to hold its own."}, {"heading": "3 Data", "text": "In this section, we discuss aspects of the data that we use in detail to support the position of the paper."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Source", "text": "The data used here are those of Bobicev and Sokolova (2015) - an extension of the data used and described in more detail in Sokolova and Bobicev (2013). The data was gathered from contributions to discussions in a sub-forum of a medical forum on in vitro fertilization (IVF) 2, which is intended for discussion by participants of a certain age group (over 35 years). Originally, the data set (henceforth MedSenti) comprised 1321 contributions on 80 different topics."}, {"heading": "3.2 Annotation Details", "text": "There are two approaches to commenting on subjective aspects of communication: from the perspective of the perception of a reader (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007) or that of the author (Balahur and Steinberger, 2009). Labeling MedSenti Sokolova and Bobicev (2013), they chose the readercentric model and asked the commentators to analyze the perception of a post as if they were other panelists. This is an important differentiation for automated classification tasks - models are built to predict how people understand the emotion an author feels as if they are being conveyed. For example, Maks and Vossen showed in review copies that the reviews reliably related to the language used than the author's original assessment. Similarly, Mehl and al showed that personality ratings perceived by a third party \"via hearing\" had a strong correlation to basic perceived labels."}, {"heading": "3.3 Data and Label Preprocessing", "text": "We select document labels according to Bobicev and Sokolova (2015): If two labels match, we reduce them to a single label; if the labels do not match, the post is marked with a sixth label ambiguous (AMBI).

As I said, our aim is not to achieve current results, but to highlight some of the challenges with current approaches."}, {"heading": "4.1 Broad methodology", "text": "In this paper, we use a robust syntactic dependency synthesis parser (Ait-Mokhtar et al., 2001) to extract a wide range of textual features, from word phrases to more complex linguistic attributes. Our experiments are outlined as multi-class classification tasks using liblinar (Fan et al., 2008) and use 5x layered cross validation. It is worth noting that we are not using a cross-domain lexicon here. We have reimplemented the Health Affect Lexicon (Sokolova et al., 2013) and it has worked just as well as previously reported. However, few studies of such approaches have shown that such lexicon generalization and brand-based tuning is very task specific."}, {"heading": "4.2 Document Level analysis", "text": "In this series of experiments, we consider each entry as a single unit of text with a single label."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 5-class classification", "text": "We used a variety of combinations of different linguistic characteristics, ranging from simple word-based n-grams to semantic dependencies. To illustrate, we list the most powerful combinations: word unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams; binary markers for questions, conjunctions, and uppercase letters; and a broad polarity dictionary. Results can be found in Table 2Our best overall score (macro-averaged F1 = 0.449) is well above the baseline of the majority class (F = 0.110), which compares favorably with the six-class performance of semantic characteristics of the original data analysis (F1 = 0.397, Sokolova, and Bobicev, 2013). However, more important - and not previously reported - is the performance in the individual category, which gives more insight into the data. Essentially, we see ENCO, GRAT, and FACT perform relatively well, while CONF, and ENO in particular, are clearly classified as having a bad classification."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 One-vs-all", "text": "To examine the error pattern in Table 3 more closely, we have tried to classify each category individually in a one-on-one task, and the results of this task, with a feature set consisting of word unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, are presented in Table 4. Note that we report only for the target class, as the other class is complementary. Again, we see a similar performance pattern: ENCO and FACT differ most from the other classes, while CONF and ENDO are markedly less strong. It is worth noting that ENDO is particularly different from the rest of the corpus - although it is the third largest category, the F score is only 0.011. It is clear that this challenge is not trivial - there are distinct error patterns in the classification at the document level. To examine this further, we will move to the classification at the record level."}, {"heading": "4.3 Sentence Level analysis", "text": "The 1137 entries from the MedSenti become 8071 sentences, MedSentisent. Manual annotations at the sentence level are not possible, as this would be a considerably expensive exercise. To mark the corpus with the five categories of feelings, we have examined the use of automated methods."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Na\u0131\u0308ve Labelling", "text": "The most trivial approach to naming sentences is that each sentence inherits the label of the place in which it exists. By this na\u00efve method, we obtain the distribution as in Table 5. We perform the 5-class classification scenario on MedSenti, using the same conditions and the previous best feature; the results will be in Table 6. Overall, the performance is worse than the post-level equivalent, with the exception of a small improvement over ENDO. FACT is the most powerful single category, though now with greater memory than precision. As at the document level, we examine the performance of the model more thoroughly with the error matrix in Table 7. The most important observation we make here is that the decline in the performance of the four subjective categories is largely due to an incorrect classification of sentences as FACT. Sentries in this category are the majority in MedSenti-Senti-Senti (more than twice as high as the closest category). However, the proportional differences do not seem to explain the significant changes in MedSenti."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Subjectivity-informed labelling", "text": "One approach to data relabeling is to take advantage of the rougher levels of annotation: that of subjectivity. Is it at least possible to distinguish which propositions are objective and could be called FACT? We developed a subjectivity model4 that was developed for the SemEval 2016 Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Track (Pontiki et al., 2016), which was one of the most powerful models for polarity detection. In order to eliminate confusion with the FACT category, we eliminated objective propositions from propositions previously labeled with the 4 subjective categories. Since this \"confusion\" can be bidirectional, we also removed all subjective propositions that were previously FACT. To eliminate confusion with the FACT category, we eliminated objective propositions from propositions previously labeled with the 4 subjective categories."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "In fact, it is as if most people are able to survive themselves by surviving themselves.

We have also shown that there are important social dimensions in this type of area that should also be taken into account. It is clear that an automated understanding of this growing pool of data is of considerable benefit; we in the social NLP community need to consider some refined approaches to maximize both the value itself and its fidelity."}], "references": [{"title": "A multi-input dependency parser", "author": ["Salah Ait-Mokhtar", "Jean-Pierre Chanod", "Claude Roux."], "venue": "Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Parsing Technologies.", "citeRegEx": "Ait.Mokhtar et al\\.,? 2001", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ait.Mokhtar et al\\.", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Can i hear you? sentiment analysis on medical forums", "author": ["Tanveer Ali", "David Schramm", "Marina Sokolova", "Diana Inkpen."], "venue": "Proceedings of the sixth international joint conference on natural language processing, Asian Federation of Natural Lan-", "citeRegEx": "Ali et al\\.,? 2013", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ali et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Rethinking sentiment analysis in the news: from theory to practice and back", "author": ["Alexandra Balahur", "Ralf Steinberger."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis, 2009.", "citeRegEx": "Balahur and Steinberger.,? 2009", "shortCiteRegEx": "Balahur and Steinberger.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Degree and reciprocity of self-disclosure in online forums", "author": ["Azy Barak", "Orit Gluck-Ofri."], "venue": "Cyberpsychology & Behavior, 10(3):407\u2013417.", "citeRegEx": "Barak and Gluck.Ofri.,? 2007", "shortCiteRegEx": "Barak and Gluck.Ofri.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "No sentiment is an island - sentiment classification on medical forums", "author": ["Victoria Bobicev", "Marina Sokolova."], "venue": "Nathalie Japkowicz and Stan Matwin, editors, Discovery Science - 18th International Conference, DS 2015, Banff, AB, Canada,", "citeRegEx": "Bobicev and Sokolova.,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bobicev and Sokolova.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Identifying the Targets of the Emotions Expressed in Health Forums, pages 85\u201397", "author": ["Sandra Bringay", "Eric Kergosien", "Pierre Pompidor", "Pascal Poncelet"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Bringay et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bringay et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Alt.support: modeling social support online", "author": ["Matthew S.
