It refers to code-switching which has become more popular in our daily life and therefore obtains an increasing amount of attention from the research community. We report our experience that cov- ers not only core NLP tasks such as normalisation, language identification, language modelling, part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing but also more downstream ones such as machine translation and automatic speech recognition. We highlight and discuss the key problems for each of the tasks with supporting examples from different language pairs and relevant previous work.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Oct 2016 10:22:26 GMT  (33kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02213v1", "Will appear in the Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Computational Approaches to Linguistic Code Switching @EMNLP, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Will appear in the Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Computational Approaches to Linguistic Code Switching @EMNLP, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["\\\"ozlem \\c{c}etino\\u{g}lu", "sarah schulz", "ngoc thang vu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02213"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.02213.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Challenges of Computational Processing of Code-Switching", "authors": ["\u00d6zlem \u00c7etino\u011flu", "Sarah Schulz", "Ngoc Thang Vu"], "emails": ["ozlem@ims.uni-stuttgart.de", "schulzsh@ims.uni-stuttgart.de", "thangvu@ims.uni-stuttgart.de"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In recent years, the number of those who are able to survive has multiplied; in recent years, the number of those who are able to survive has multiplied; in recent years, the number of those who are able to survive has multiplied."}, {"heading": "2 Data", "text": "The nature of data Annotated CS corpora, designed for computational purposes, has so far focused on three sources: spoken data (Solorio and Liu, 2008b; Lyu et al., 2015; Y\u0131lmaz et al., 2016), social media (Nguyen and Dog ru\u00f6z, 2013; Barman et al., 2014; Vyas et al., 2014; Solorio et al., 2014; Choudhury et al., 2014; Jamatia et al., 2015; \u00c7etinog lu, 2016; Samih and Maier, 2016), and historical texts (Schulz and Keller, 2016).

Some of these challenges are language pair-dependent, such as romanization and back translation into Hindi or Bengali. Others are recurring in different tasks regardless of the language, such as the increased number of invisible constructions caused by the combination of lexicon and syntax of two languages. Working on NLP for mixed data has the advantage that resources and tools for the respective languages can be beneficial. Although we do not have to start from scratch, the tasks and required techniques are significantly different from those for monolingual data. Context-sensitive methods suffer from increased combinatorial capabilities that cross syntactic and lexical systems of different languages. Moreover, CS is a phenomenon that appears in data with difficult-to-process factors other than mixing."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank our anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
