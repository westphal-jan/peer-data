Among the various approaches to expanding plan synthesis, the use of macro actions has been widely researched. As a first step to developing a solution for learning online macro actions, we propose an algorithm to identify useful macro actions based on data mining techniques. Integrating these learned macro actions into planning shows significant improvements over four classic planning benchmarks.

A plan is a structure of appropriate actions for a specific problem within a given area. From a frequent sequence of some of these actions it is possible to build a meta-action structure called macro action. Finding a way to learn macro actions from previously acquired knowledge (plans) can allow us to quickly penetrate deep into the search space by triggering them during the search. While most literature presents macro action synthesis as the result of using a filtering approach over previously discovered macro actions in a series of training problems [1, 5, 4, 2] we propose a novel and general macro learning method as part of the effort to automatically detect potential macro actions and use them in planning search."}, {"heading": "2 Mining useful Macro-actions", "text": "The main idea of our approach is to build macro actions from sequential action patterns in a series of plans and use them during the planning phase to improve the performance of the planning system.A sequential action pattern is a frequent action sequence (\u03b1) that exists in a single plan or series of plans (\u03b8).Supporting a sequence supp\u03b8 (\u03b1) is the number of plans that contain \u03b1. Our method of learning and using macro actions consists of two algorithms. The set-up algorithm accepts as input a set of non-empty solution plans. The reduction of sequential patterns consists in finding the complete set of frequent sub-sequences that have a set of plans and maintain support thresholds. Our method of learning and using macro actions includes two algorithms. The set-up algorithm accepts a set of non-empty solution plans as input. It receives a set of closed sequential patterns that are included in the pattern by using the B6 algorithm instead of the B6."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "The experiments were based on Barman, Depots, Ferry and Sokoban benchmarks and were conducted on an Intel Xeon E5-2630 2.30GHz. Allocated CPU time was set at 300 seconds with a maximum of 8GB of memory. For each benchmark, a learning set of 1000 problems and a test set of 300 problems were randomly generated with the generators used for the International Planning Competition (IPC). We went through the SPMF [3] data mining library, which implements the BIDE + algorithm, to obtain the set of frequent sequences that vary the degree of support between 10% and 30%. We used the PDDL4J library to encode them into a predictive planner based on A * algorithm and FF heuristics. The evaluation is based on the classical metrics of quality and time used in IPC."}], "references": [{"title": "Macro-FF: Improving AI Planning with Automatically Learned Macro-Operators", "author": ["A.
