INTRODUCTION", "text": "The philosophical term \"ontology\" was first used by Tom Grubar [1] as an \"explicit specification of conceptualization\" for the artificial intelligence community and has been defined in different ways by knowledge representation and argumentation communities ever since. An ontology represents concepts within a domain and determines how the concepts relate to each other, through logical axioms expressed in a formal language (e.g. W3C's OWL description language for the Semantic Web [12]). Typical layers of an ontological knowledge model include the conceptual layer, the formal logical layer, and the application layers represented in ontology."}, {"heading": "2. MOTIVATION AND RELATED WORKS", "text": "Observing the literature corpus through the Google Scholar search reveals the fact that this type of survey on the use of ontologies in cloud computing is extremely sparse. To the best of our knowledge, the only related work we could find that could be considered a \"survey\" is the paper by Androcec et al. (2012) in [7]. However, efforts in [7] seem to be quite limited in scope, length (only 5 pages), and content to give a fair understanding of how ontologies are actually applied in various aspects of cloud computing. The latter facts have prompted us to work on a comprehensive overview of the most up-to-date techniques, trends, and practices that exist within the literature corpus of ontologies and cloud computing. The aim of this paper is to explore the key landscapes of ontologies in cloud computing."}, {"heading": "3. METHODS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Hypothesis", "text": "The hypothesis of this project is that ontologies, together with their reasoning skills, can have a significant impact on improving various aspects of cloud computing phenomena. Ontologies can promote intelligent decision support mechanisms for different cloud-based services and foster effective interoperability between cloud-based systems and resources."}, {"heading": "3.2 Research Procedure", "text": "Our research on this survey is based on systematic review procedures as described by Kitchenham (2004) in [10]. We have also borrowed, if necessary, some instructions from Biolchini et al. (2005) [11] Both articles included a set of guidelines to address specific problems in software engineering research, as well as a formalized procedure to evaluate and interpret all available research results relevant to specific research issues, subject areas, or interesting phenomena [10, 11]. Kitchenham's systematic review process provided a practical understanding of the stages of planning, conducting, and reporting an effective computer science review."}, {"heading": "3.3 Research Questions", "text": "In order to conduct a systematic survey, this paper attempts to address the following research questions in general: Why do we need ontologies for the cloud? How significant are the efforts to date? What are the main limiting factors of ontology-based tools and systems developed for the cloud? What specific aspects of cloud computing can be improved or simplified using ontologies and their thinking skills? All these questions are discussed in detail in Section 5."}, {"heading": "3.4 Classification of Efforts", "text": "To provide a systematic overview, we need to provide a common classification scheme for the literature for a broad phenomenon such as cloud computing. Based on the search results obtained by Google Scholar, we considered the following classification of common topics: 1. Interoperability between cloud systems 2. Symantec models in cloud computing 3. Cloud Computing Security4. Cloud Resource Management and Service Discovery This classification is based on the specific cloud computing issues that should be improved or simplified by applying ontologies."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS", "text": "As the title of this paper suggests, this project is expected to lead to an up-to-date understanding of ontologies and their applications in general cloud computing phenomena. In this section, we present the results with regard to the questions classified in Section 3.4."}, {"heading": "4.1 Cloud Interoperability", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is one of the greatest challenges in the history of the European Union."}, {"heading": "4.2 Semantic Models in Cloud Computing", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "4.3 Cloud Computing Security", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules that they need for their work, and they will be able to play by the rules that they need for their work."}, {"heading": "4.4 Cloud Resource Management and Cloud Service Discovery", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it will be able to retaliate, \"he said.\" We've never lost so much time, \"he said.\" We're not there yet, \"he said.\" We've never waited so long to be able to find a solution. \""}, {"heading": "5. Discussion", "text": "The general idea of cloud computing has evolved since the very beginning of the term itself. There is no unified way to identify and classify all aspects of the cloud computing phenomenon that can support a common vocabulary and common understanding among cloud computing researchers and the industries that provide cloud-based services. One of the reasons for this is that the idea of \"cloud computing\" significantly overlaps with a number of previous ideas from different areas of computer science, in particular from distributed systems, database management systems, parallel computing architectures, web-based computing, and so on. So the idea of having an ontology that could represent the whole area of cloud computing in a unified way is quite fascinating."}, {"heading": "5.1 Cloud Systems Interoperability", "text": "The potential benefits of using ontologies to achieve semantic interoperability among heterogeneous cloud systems have been established in [9], [18] and [5]. The layered architecture proposed by Youseff and al provides the basis for a unified ontology for the general phenomena of cloud computing, and the hope of the paper was to promote much-desired interoperability between cloud systems. It describes the basic characteristics of cloud computing in a systematic manner. With over 400 citations, this work has been very influential among cloud computing and ontology researchers. Although the high-level architecture is presented by Youseff et al, it forms the basis for the development of a comprehensive ontology that addresses the formal, logical aspects of ontology."}, {"heading": "5.2 Semantic Models and the Cloud", "text": "As noted in Section 4.2, Sheth et al. identifies three main aspects of cloud computing where semantic models could be helpful; the aspect of semantic interoperability between cloud systems could suffer from the analogous problems discussed in 5.1. Indeed, the proposed approach of semantic annotation of DSL scripts or structured documents can be very useful in deriving the higher-level abstractions of an application. However, the author has not discussed any of the practical problems of automating the process of annotation and imaging with ontologies; the proposed approach may require an enormous amount of manual work to comment on the specific fragments of different source code documents. Mika and Tommerallo (2008) [20] discussed the sandice system for processing the data network provides a number of practical scalability problems that are normally overlooked by the semantic web community."}, {"heading": "5.3 Cloud Computing Security", "text": "The advantages of using ontologies for security aspects in the cloud environment have been well recognized by the efforts observed in Section 4.3. However, the approaches discussed in this section should require further practical evaluation. However, the proposed ontology to present the concepts and entities of cybersecurity for the cloud environment by Takahashi et al. (2010) looked very promising. However, when it comes to using ontology to see the actual benefit, we need to map different concepts of different security protocols used in different cloud systems. The process of mapping security protocols from different cloud systems would certainly require an enormous amount of manual work. However, the authors did not seem to have any major concerns about this practical problems.The ontology-based decision support tool used by Bertram et al. (2010) for the on-demand cloud security service also looked promising. However, the core of their approach, the provocative decision system directly supported by the author, has some skepticism."}, {"heading": "5.4 Cloud Resource Management and Service Discovery", "text": "As shown in Figure 18, the ontology-based resource allocation algorithm developed by Ma et al. (2011) [25] has significantly exceeded the existing approaches. However, it should be noted that the evaluation was carried out in an experimental environment in which the argumentation results were pre-calculated. If we want to operate the system \"on the fly,\" the ontological reasoning based on the SWFD rules used by the system can lead to significant performance losses. Han and Sim's (2010) ontology-based approach [27] for Cloud Service Discovery System could also suffer from the analogous problem of compromised performance for dynamic service selection operations."}, {"heading": "6. Concluding Remarks", "text": "As the title of this paper suggests, it was expected that this project would lead to the improvement or simplification of the current state-of-the-art understanding of ontologies and their applications within the phenomena of cloud computing. As the results of this survey suggest, ontologies, together with their reasoning skills, may have some significant implications for improving or simplifying a number of critical aspects of cloud computing. We have observed a number of specific aspects of cloud computing where ontology-based solutions, as presented in various literature, have been applied. The scope of this project was focused on the following four specific aspects of cloud computing: Cloud Systems Interoperability, Semantic Models and the Cloud, Cloud Computing Security and Cloud Resource Management and Service Discovery. It should be noted that the emergence of new paradigms such as Linked Data [14], BigData [13] and Semantic Web Technologies also play a crucial role in the application of ontologies for the cloud computing paradigm."}, {"heading": "7.

This survey can promote a comprehensive understanding on the roles and significance of ontologies within the overall domain of Cloud Computing. Also, this project can potentially form the basis of new research area and possibilities for both ontology and Cloud computing communities.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
