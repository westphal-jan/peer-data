In this paper, we develop the Computational Linking Theory framework as a method for implementing and testing linking theories proposed in the theoretical literature. We deploy this framework to assess two cross-cutting types of linking theory: local v. global models and categorical v. featural models. To further investigate the behavior of these models, we develop a measurement model in the spirit of previous work in semantic role induction: the Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model. We use this model, which implements a generalization of Dowty's seminal Proto-Role Theory, to induce semantic proto-roles, which we compare to those Dowty proposes.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 8 Oct 2016 15:24:50 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02544v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aaron steven white", "drew reisinger", "rachel rudinger", "kyle rawlins", "benjamin van durme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02544"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.02544.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Computational linking theory", "authors": ["Aaron Steven White", "Drew Reisinger", "Rachel Rudinger", "Kyle Rawlins", "Benjamin Van Durme"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, the majority of people who fight for the rights of women and men are fighting for the rights of men and women, not for the rights of women and men, but for equality between men and women, for equality between men and women, for equality between men and women, for equality between men and women, for equality between men and women, for equality between men and women, for equality between men and women, for equality and equality between men and women, for equality and equality between men and women, for equality and equality between men and women and for equality between men and women.

Hajic et al., 2004).This problem was particularly important in the field of statistical machine translation (SMT), where one has to translate from morphologically poor languages such as English into morphologically richer languages such as Japanese and German (Koehn, 2005).SMT researchers have largely focused on the use of morphologic and syntactical predictors. Suzuki and Toutanova (2006, 2007) construct models for predicting Japanese morphologic cases (the syntactic position in languages that have such cases) by means of intralanguagulating positional and alignment-based features, and Jeong et al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al (2010) extend this line of work to Bulgarian, Czech and Korean.

A continuation with examples (1) and (2) from linkage theory would explain why (and when) HITTERS and Marquez, but not HITTEE, but HITTEE and HITTEE, which aims at subject position."}, {"heading": "2.3 Abstracting semantic roles", "text": "In order to predict syntactical positions, linkage theories aim to exploit the linkage of regularities. One way to link regularities is to abstract through semantic arguments in such a way that abstractions correlate with syntactic positions. Therefore, two main types of abstraction have been proposed: on the one hand, categorical theories that group semantic arguments into a finite series of semantic roles - e.g. HITTER are AGENTs, HITTEE are PATIENTs, etc. - and then (deterministically) map these categories to syntactic positions - e.g. subject, direct object, etc. (Fillmore, 1970; Zwicky, 1971; Jackendoff, 1972; Carter, 1976, and others; see Levin and Rappaport Hovav 2005; Williams 2015 for a review). In a categorical theory, it is a series of discrete indications, such as are assumed in the bank."}, {"heading": "2.4 Role fragmentation", "text": "Above all, the relatively broad coverage of categorical theories requires an ever-increasing number of roles to capture regularities - a phenomenon that Dowty (1991) calls role fragmentation. Given role fragmentation, categorical theories have two options: they use a large number of roles, or (ii) force the fragmented roles into classes that predict the syntax well but point to many different (possibly incoherent) semantic terms. These same decisions must be made when developing a resource."}, {"heading": "3 Data", "text": "For all experiments, the datasets are based on the thematic role annotations of Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) in PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005) mapped using SemLink (Loper et al., 2007), as well as on the dataset Semantic Proto-Roles Version 1.0 (SPR1) of Crowd-sourced Proto-role annotations (Reisinger et al., 2015). SPR1 annotations consist of answers to simple questions about how likely it is that certain relational properties contain arguments of PropBank annotations (cf. Kako, 2006; Greene et Resnik et al., 2009; Hartshorne et al., 2013). Reisinger et al. constructed the questions to match Dowty's respective proto-role characteristics.

This is useful here because linkage theories tend to treat semantic arguments that emerge as NPs only as NPs. Despite these filters, some non-NPs occur in SPR1. To address this, we filter out any dependencies that do not have a UD dependency designation that matches nsubj, dobj, iobj, or nmod."}, {"heading": "3.2 VerbNet subset", "text": "VerbNet contains role comments for only a subset of the SPR1 data. This has to do with the fact that only a subset of verbs in the PTB that are provided with PropBank roller sets are also commented with VerbNet verb classes. Another subset of these verbs has also commented their arguments (whose spans are defined by PropBank) with VerbNet semantic roles. So there are three types of verbs in the corpus: those without VerbNet annotations, those that are commented only with verb classes, and those with verb classes and semantic role comments. We apply our models to both the complete set of SPR1 annotations and the VerbNet commented subset."}, {"heading": "3.3 Final datasets", "text": "Counting the argument type shows only subjects (nsubj), direct objects (dobj), indirect objects (iobj), and oblique objects (nmod) in this dataset. This is problematic for the cross-validation we apply in \u00a7 4. To fix this, we will collapse the indirect object name to the name of the direct object. This is linguistically justified, since indirect objects in the sense of Universal Dependencies (and most other dependency sparse standards) are actually only a subspecies of the direct object."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluating linking models", "text": "In this section, we implement categorical and featural linkage models by constructing classifiers that predict the syntactical position (subject, direct object, inclination) of an argument based either on the thematic role of this argument (e.g. AGENT, PATIENT, etc.) or on the effects that the verb has on this argument (e.g. INSTIGATION, VOLITION, etc.).For each type of predictor, two linear classifiers are constructed to develop a local linkage model (Experiment 1) that predicts syntactic positions independently of other arguments, and (ii) a global linkage model (Experiment 2) that predicts syntactic positions in relation to other arguments."}, {"heading": "4.1 Classifiers", "text": "Experiment 1 uses simple logistic regression, and Experiment 2 uses a conditional random field (CRF) analogous to the logistic regression used for Experiment 1 but containing factors for each pair of arguments (see Figure 2 for an example with three arguments).

Supplementary judgments from SPR1 were presented as vector li of the probability that the argument of probability ratingslij [1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for each potential sequence j. Ratings lij in SPR1 are also associated with values corresponding to the applicability of arguments from SPR1."}, {"heading": "4.2 Cross-validation", "text": "To validate and verify the models in both experiments, a layered cross-validation with 10 folds on both levels of nesting was used. For each of the 10 folds in the outer CV, the L2 regularization parameter \u03b1 was determined by means of a grid search of \u03b1 = 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10} on the 10 folds of the inner CV with the highest average value F1 as the selection criterion. For each of the outer folds, the model with this optimal \u03b1 was reset to the full training set in that fold and tested on the basis of the sustained data of that fold. In Experiment 2, a further limitation was imposed that the folds do not have separate arguments in the same set. All reported F1, precision and memory values are calculated from tests on the outer endured sets, and all error analyses are performed for errors when an object was found in an outer sustained fold."}, {"heading": "4.3 Results", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "4.4 Discussion", "text": "In this section, we found (i) that global models significantly improve local models for both categorical and featural predictors, and (ii) that overall featural models perform worse than categorical models. In the next section, we will show the use of CLT as a framework for exploring linkage theories - especially featural linkage theories - by developing a measurement model that addresses the issue of multimodality raised in this section."}, {"heading": "5 Exploring linking models", "text": "In this section, we introduce the Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model (SPROLIM), a hybrid model of multiple views to induce semantic protorole roles for each argument of a predicate from the property judgments used in the last section. This model can be seen as a further generalization of Dowty's protorole theory, which includes the idea that semantic roles have a prototype structure. In Experiment 3, we apply SPROLIM to the SPR1 data to discover semantic protoroles. We examine how the structure of semantic protoroles changes when we allow more diverse protorole types, and find that the one constant prototype is a PROTOAGENT role with exactly the structure Dowty proposed. Dowty's PROTOPATIENT role, on the other hand, seems to be more of a collection of several other protoroles."}, {"heading": "5.1 Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model", "text": "There are four main components of the SPROLIM model. The first component is a representation of the relationship between a predicate l (exical) -thematic roles (Dowty, 1989) - e.g. for the verb hit, the HITTEE and HITTING INSTRUMENT roles - and generalized semantic roles - e.g. PROTOAGENT and PROTOPATIENT. To make it clear that l-thematic roles are abstract, we refer to them through the more transparent types of designations and denote the set of argumentation types for a verb v with AV. The second component of the SPROLIM model is a representation of the relationship between the semantic role that has an argument and (i) the probability that property is applicable to this argument (ii) if it is probable that property holds this property."}, {"heading": "5.2 Experiment 3", "text": "In this experiment, we match SPROLIM to the SPR1 data and examine the semantic protoroles it learns. We use projected gradients with AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) to find an approximation to the maximum probability estimates (MLE) for the number of semantic protoroles. We are interested in the behavior of the model, but we cannot examine the results for all possible values here. To reduce the number of protoroles, we have to adjust the number of semantic protoroles."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we introduced a framework for the theory of computer-assisted linkage (CLT) and used this framework for two different purposes: evaluation (\u00a7 4) and exploration (\u00a7 5). In \u00a7 4, we evaluated four linkage models based on theoretical suggestions: local vs. global linkage models and categorical vs. featural linkage models. We found that global models exceed local models and categorical models exceed featural models. In \u00a7 5, we developed the Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model to better understand how the property space used in the featural models relates to syntax. In examining the behavior of this model, we found that it is strikingly similar to that of Dowty (1991), but that other dowty prototypes fall into several different prototypes."}], "references": [{"title": "Categorical data analysis", "author": ["Alan Agresti"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Agresti.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Agresti.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Enriching Morphologically Poor Languages for Statistical Machine Translation", "author": ["Eleftherios Avramidis", "Philipp Koehn"], "venue": "In Proceedings of ACL08: HLT,", "citeRegEx": "Avramidis and Koehn.,? \\Q2008\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Avramidis and Koehn.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Incorporation: A theory of grammatical function changing", "author": ["Mark C.
