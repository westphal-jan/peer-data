The horizontal axis of the main chart represents time (beginning in 2004), and the vertical is how often a term is searched by the total number of search results. This query index is available by country, state, and metro level for the United States and several other countries. On August 5, 2008, we launched Google Insights for Search, a more sophisticated and advanced service that displays search trends. On September 27, 2012, Google merged Google Insights for Search in Google Trends 36. Google classifies search results into categories at the level of search results at the classification level."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "The results show that patients tend to be more interested in Cymbalta than Effexor. In addition, a review of the major events presented by medications in letters shows the response of patients to the drug milestones. For example, the approval of Cymbalta for muscle pain and chronic joint disease shows a good impact on web users for two years before returning to 2013. In addition, Table 1 lists the five most important related queries for each of the medications studied. The related queries reveal the high interest of web users with the side effects of both medications in the first place. Furthermore, consumers were interested in drug withdrawal and its effects. From the top queries of Cymbalta is \"pain\" and that can be explained by the fact that the FDA approved Cymbalta Cymbalta."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We have shown how web data can facilitate medical research by providing an overview of the state of the art in this area of pharmacovigilance. While previous studies have relied mainly on Twitter and medical forums and websites to monitor medicines and find side effects, we have shown the importance of information that we can extract from alternative data sources such as Google Trends and Google Correlate, while we have examined the case study of duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor). This paper provides researchers with alternative tools to answer medical questions using web data, but we have only been able to analyze trends and data separately from different sources, mainly due to the large data imbalance associated with data from Twitter and Google. In the future, we will also analyze the series of events that influence trends and correlations."}], "references": [{"title": "Pharmacokinetic variability of anticancer agents,\" Nature Reviews Cancer, vol", "author": ["S.D.
