In particular, we present the first steps towards the development of a real-world Hindi-English machine translation system for doctor-patient communication. As this is a low-resource language pair, especially for speech and for the medical domain, our initial focus has been on gathering suitable training data from various sources. We applied a variety of methods ranging from fully automatic extraction from the Web to manual annotation of test data. Moreover, we developed a method for automatically augmenting the training data with synthetically generated variants, which yielded a very sizable improvement of more than 3 BLEU points absolute.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 9 Oct 2016 06:42:02 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02633v1", "CICLING-2016: 17th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics, Keywords: Machine Translation, medical translation, doctor-patient communication, resource-poor languages, Hindi"]], "COMMENTS": "CICLING-2016: 17th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics, Keywords: Machine Translation, medical translation, doctor-patient communication, resource-poor languages, Hindi", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ahmad musleh", "nadir durrani", "irina temnikova", "preslav nakov", "stephan vogel", "osama alsaad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02633"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.02633.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Enabling Medical Translation for Low-Resource Languages", "authors": ["Ahmad Musleh", "Nadir Durrani", "Irina Temnikova", "Preslav Nakov", "Stephan Vogel", "Osama Alsaad"], "emails": ["amusleh@qf.org.qa", "ndurrani@qf.org.qa", "itemnikova@qf.org.qa", "pnakov@qf.org.qa", "svogel@qf.org.qa", "osama.alsaad@qatar.tamu.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 161 0.02 633v 1 [cs.C L] 9O ct2 01Keywords: machine translation, medical translation, doctor-patient communication, resource poor languages, Hindi."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In recent years, Qatar's booming economy has led to a rapid growth in the number of migrant workers needed for the growing number of infrastructure projects; these migrant workers, mainly from southern parts of Asia, generally know little or no English and do not speak Arabic, creating a communication barrier between them and the locals, but the situation is more serious in the event of a medical emergency, causing serious problems as public administration and services in Qatar mostly use Arabic and English. According to a report by Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC1) in Qatar [15], nearly 78% of patients attending Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC, the main healthcare provider in Qatar) do not speak Arabic or English. The study also pointed out that in 2012 (in this order) the five most spoken languages in Qatar are Nepali, Urdu, Hindi, English and Arabic. The report also pointed out that although HMC is currently using medical interpreters to overcome this problem, the number is not sufficient."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In the following, we first describe some MT applications for communication between doctor and patient.

Another system [26] combined web-based monolingual data and a bilingual lexicon to complete the limited parallel corpora in domain.

While it can be used to translate all 50,000 OOOV words, previous research has shown that transliteration is useful for more than just the translation of OOV words in the translation of closely related language pairs [29,31,38,41,42]. Following [9], we translate all Urdu words into Hindi and hypothesize n-best translations, along with regular translations. The idea is to create novel Hindi translations that are missing in the regular and interpolated phrase mapping, but there is evidence of this in the language model. Furthermore, the overlapping evidence in the translation and translation of phrase tables improves the overall system. We learn a clutter Hindi transliteration model [10] from word alignments of Hindi-Urdu-Urdu tables."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments and Evaluation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Machine Translation", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "5.2 Manual Evaluation", "text": "In addition to the above evaluation, we conducted a small manual evaluation experiment using the appraise platform [16]. The following two sections describe the results of the Hindi-English (Section 5.2.1) and English-Hindi (Section 5.2.2) evaluations. Similar to evaluation campaigns such as WMT, the evaluators were shown the translations and references. 15 We used mkcls to group the data into 50 clusters, and the evaluators were asked to assign each translation to one of the following three categories: (a) helpful in this situation, (b) misleading, and (c) doubtful that people will understand it."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have improved our base system through two approaches, namely (i) additional data collection and (ii) automatic data synthesis. We have removed useful dictionaries from Wikipedia to improve the coverage of our system. We have used the kinship between Hindi and Urdu to generate Hindi-English-Bi synthetic texts by automatically translating 87,000 Urdu sentences into Hindi. Both our data collection and synthesis approach worked well and have shown significant improvements over the base system, resulting in a total improvement of + 3.11 BLEU points absolute for English-Hindi and + 2.07 for Hindi-English. In the error analysis of Hindi editions, we have found that most errors are due to the arrangement of the words in the output or to incorrect lexical selections. In future work, we plan to collect more data for the best system. In the error analysis of the Hindi edition, we have made the most errors attributable to the arrangement of the words in the output or the linguistic sequence."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank Naila Khalisha and Manisha Bansal for their contributions to the project."}], "references": [{"title": "EMILLE, A 67-Million Word Corpus of Indic Languages: Data Collection, Mark-up and Harmonisation", "author": ["Paul Baker", "Andrew Hardie", "Tony McEnery", "Hamish Cunningham", "Robert J.
