However, there seems to be no other work than our own efforts to take an ontology-based approach. There have been some related works that use ontologies, though not block chain-related. Perhaps the most comprehensive is traceability ontology (Kim et al. 1995), which served as a key component of TOVE Ontologies for Enterprise Modeling (Fox and Gruninger 1998). Interestingly, this traceability work has attracted interest among food scientists (Dabbene et al. 2014) (Regattieri et al. 2007).
