It has been shown that argumentation is a perspicuous abstraction method that covers several existing argumentation paradigms, in particular non-monotonous argumentation and logic programming. (see e.g. [30, 15, 38] and forms of decision-making (see e.g. [2]), argumentation can be seen as a significant approach to argumentation."}, {"heading": "39, 50, 22, 32]).", "text": "The idea of reversing views is associated with preference-based argumentation frameworks (PAFs) [6] - an AA-based formalism that takes preferences into account.

ASPIC + (without counterposition) produces arguments A = [\u03b2] and B \"= a single attack B.\" Since there are no invincible rules, B is \"less preferred than A\" (in symbols, B \"), in relation to any standard argument used in ASPIC +.

However, the new attack relationship is based on the idea that while (default) rebut in ASPIC + is allowed only on the conclusion of a defective rule, unrestricted rebound is allowed on the conclusion of each rule. An essential feature of ASPIC \u2212 is that it only works with the total preference of orders over vanquishable rules, and if a partial arrangement is used instead, as in ABA +, then extensions under different semantics need not postulate rationality [21] or prove other desirable properties, as mentioned in [22] by analyzing example 17."}, {"heading": "8 Concluding Remarks", "text": "We have ABA +, a structured reasoning that conservatively refers to Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) and introduces a novel technique for reversing attacks based on preference information.
