Each session began with a period of getting to know each other, after which the first tutoring period began, followed by another small social interlude, a second tutoring period with role swapping between the tutor and the tutee, and then the last social time.We evaluated our automatic recognition of the violation of social norms against these strategies.

To this end, we first used each clause, the smallest units that can express a full sentence, as a predictive unit. Next, inspired by in-depth analysis in [14], we extracted verbal and visual characteristics of the speaker that were strongly correlated with clauses that violate social norms, setting the rare threshold to 20. Verbal characteristics included LIWC characteristics [5] that helped categorize words used during the use of violations of social norms, bigrams, parts of speech bigrams, and word components of speech pairs from the speaker clauses. Visual characteristics included head nodes, information about smiles, and moments of the speaker. In total, there were 3,782 characteristics per clause."}, {"heading": "3.1 Models", "text": "We treated a dialogue D as a sequence of clauses c0,... cT, where T was the number of clauses in D. Each sentence ci was a tuple ([wi0,... w i m], ei), where [w i 0,... w i m] were the m words in the sentence ci, and ei was the corresponding meta-information such as the relationship of the dyad and nonverbal behavior during the generation of the sentence. The craftsmanship characteristic of size 3782 was called fi and could be considered a mapping function F: ci \u2192 fi. Meanwhile, each sentence was associated with a binary term yi \u04410, 1}, which indicates the basic truth about whether ci is a violation of the social norm. Ultimately, the goal was to model p (yt | c0: t), the conditional distribution of whether the last sentence was a violation of the social norm, given the entire history of the dialogue."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Logistic Regression Model", "text": "We first trained an L2-regulated logistic regression model using the proposed verbal and visual characteristics fi as input (far left in Figure 1), which serves as a starting point."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Local/Global-Context RNN Model", "text": "Past empirical results indicate two possible hypotheses for improving model performance: 1.

First, comparing the logistic regression model with our best model shows that the result indicates the strong predictive power of long-term context information about the task of detecting social norm violations in dialogue. On the other hand, the Local-Context RNN model did not significantly improve overall performance in terms of logistic regression, meaning that our learned clause representation in the training process is less competent than handmade features inspired by language skills. A possible reason for such a result could be insufficient training scope to learn a generic sentence representation."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "Inspired by handcrafted multimodal characteristics derived from qualitative and quantitative analyses of previous empirical studies, we developed a Global Context RNN model for detecting violations of social norms in human dialogue. This model will play an important role in building socially aware actors who have the skills to understand interpersonal dynamics that unfold in interaction, which is indispensable for better adaptation to the interpersonal relationship of their users. To serve this goal, our future work will build a generative model of social norm violations that will allow an agent to act in the direction of a more realistic understanding, thinking and producing of human behavior."}], "references": [{"title": "Obligations as social constructs", "author": ["Guido Boella", "Leendert Van Der Torre"], "venue": "In Congress of the Italian Association for
