Introduction", "text": "NELL (Never-Ending Language Learner) [1] is a computer system that runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It was launched on January 12, 2010 and was supposed to run forever, read the web and collect more and more facts to enlarge and populate its own knowledge base. In short, we can describe the system as follows: NELL's initial knowledge base (KB) is an ontology that defines hundreds of categories (e.g. athlete, sport, sports team, fruit, product, country, city, emotions, etc.) and relationships (e.g. athletePlaysForTeam (athlete, sports team), cityLocatedInCountry (city, country) and a set of 10 to 15 examples (examples) for each of categories (e.g. athlete (Kobe Bryant), country, city, emotions, etc.) and relationships (e.g. athlete PlaysForTeam (athlete, country) and a number of categories (e.g. athlete)."}, {"heading": "2. NELL\u2019s input", "text": "The key of NELL is to read and understand better every day. We can imagine a person reading a book on an unknown topic, and as much knowledge a person reads the book, so much knowledge he can extract. NELL does a similar job: It reads the web many times (let's call it \"iterations\"), which takes up a lot of time and resources. NELL processes a source base from the text called all-pair data."}, {"heading": "3.

NELL\u2019s Ontology", "text": "To start a new NELL instance, we need to name some categories and relationships, give examples of them, and specify some configuration parameters to maintain the structure of the ontology. To do this, we have created tables that are then interpreted by scripting programs. Running the script creates the NELL Initial Knowledge Base (KB), and this initial KB is used in the learning process to learn more (input and output of the NELL process)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Ontology Mapping", "text": "To create a new instance of NELL in a new language, we can create an ontology from scratch, or we can map the English. Ontology mapping is the process when the English tables are used to create a mapping for another language. We say \"mapping\" because it is not just a translation, because categories names and relationships need to be customized for the new language. For example: State (original category in English, translated \"budget\" in French) can have a different translation depending on the context. All columns of the tableau need to be mapped. The most important points are 1) give the names of categories and relationships in the new language and 2) give the names of each predicate. Some examples of the tableau columns for categories are: category name, seeds of instances (e.g.: for the category city, the seeds can be: Paris, Saint-Etienne, Lyon, etc.), human format (e.g. \"X is a city,\" where the instances X is connected to each other, i.e. the city is part of the city)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Human Supervision", "text": "Once the new ontology has been created, it can be used in the NELL process. After that, it is possible to start with the human supervision step. Human supervision based on knowledge is used to make NELL learning better and faster. The system learns every day and must be monitored and corrected to learn to reject misinterpretations of text. The supervision task has some parameters (time / number of supervision) that can be changed as the learning process develops."}, {"heading": "5. Challenges", "text": "We are developing the method to start new instances of NELL in different languages and then develop NELL's multilingualism. Our method is based on our experiences in NELL Portuguese and NELL French. A next step will be to work on the translingual aspects of NELL. How do you export the knowledge from the English version to the others? The idea is that we can improve the knowledge base of all NELL versions by sharing and exchanging knowledge from different languages. Such \"bridges\" between the knowledge databases would help the new ones to grow faster and then learn and improve faster. Conversely, text in other languages could indirectly enrich the English NELL, which is unable to find certain knowledge. Another important perspective is to provide an easy way to map the NELL ontology with another knowledge base, for example DBPedia. BDPedia is (Semantic Web Knowledge Representative Model) working on applications that are fearful of representing NELL in other knowledge bases."}], "references": [{"title": "Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning", "author": ["A.
