A \"chain\" in Switch-Side Chain-Chess (SSCC) is basically a sequence of C, which is a continuous piece (the sequence)."}, {"heading": "2 METHODOLOGY", "text": "In fact, it is the case that the majority of people who work for the rights of women and men are working for the rights of men and women, not for the rights of women and men, but for the rights of women and men who work for the rights of men and women.

(...) It is as if women and the rights of women and the rights of women come to the fore. (...) It is as if the rights of women and the rights of men are being put at the centre stage. \"(...)

Specifically, it has application in the chess variant known as \"Switch-Side Chain-Chess\" (SSCC). An earlier attempt to develop such an algorithm led to something that only occasionally leads to false positives or false negatives. In the light of such examples, the current algorithm had to be modified, but it seems to be stable in its current form, even if it is unable to prove that there are no possible positions with chain formations where the algorithm would not fail."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A: ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION AND PSEUDOCODE", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to understand the world and understand what they are doing do not know what they are supposed to do, but what they are supposed to do to change the world.
