In this paper, we show how Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models can be used to generate musical expression in order to mimic a human performance. As a training corpus, we had a professional pianist play about 150 melodies of jazz, pop, and latin jazz. The results show a good predictive power, validating the choice of our model. Additionally, we set up a listening test whose results reveal that on average, people significantly prefer the melodies generated by the MaxEnt model than the ones without any expression, or with fully random expression.

In our example, we took Khormax = 3 and K diag max = 1 and trained the model on the swing sub-corpus. These values are a good compromise between too many parameters and good efficiency in capturing correlations. Two quantities can be calculated along the generation process to monitor the convergence level of the sequence."}, {"heading": "2.2 Perceptive validation", "text": "In the previous section, we have shown various mathematical criteria that provide for the validation of the structure and the implementation of MaxEnt models for musical expression. In order to be consistent with our goal, it is necessary to perform a perspective validation, and that is how we proceeded: 5 / 12Protocol: We have set up a paired comparison test of 4 different versions of a melody: our base version, which is called \"straight\" (with zero microtiming deviations and a constant loudness), a version played by the professional performer (called \"human\"), a version generated by our models (called \"MaxEnt\") and a control version, which is called \"random,\" where microtiming deviations and loudness with an empirical gaussian distribution2. Each participant was asked to select two different versions of the tune for each of the 6 tunes."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusion & perspectives", "text": "The structure of this model (see Figure 2), despite the pairing nature of the information used, leads to the replication of complex patterns. The pairing correlations also deal with both continuous and categorical variables. The results are particularly satisfying for a stereotypical style such as swing, while encouraging more complex styles such as ballads or Latin jazz. One of the most challenging perspectives is to allow an expression model to add or remove notes. This model would be very useful if it were also taken into account in terms of the complexity of music."}, {"heading": "3.1 Appendix: Model details", "text": "In this appendix we show the target observables to be reproduced = k = k = k = k = b = b = b = b = b = standard deviation of a variable Yv connected to a continuous voice v: f contmean (Yv) = 1 NN \u2211 n = 1 Yv (n) = Y \u0445 v (15) f contsd (Yv) = 1 N \u2211 n = 1 (Yv (n) \u2212 Y \u0445 v) 2.
