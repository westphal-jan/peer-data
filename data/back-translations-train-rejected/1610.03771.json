The goal is to extract fine-grained information with respect to entities mentioned in user comments. This work extends both aspect-based sentiment analysis that assumes a single entity per document and targeted sentiment analysis that assumes a single sentiment towards a target entity. In particular, we identify the sentiment towards each aspect of one or more entities. As a testbed for this task, we introduce the SentiHood dataset, extracted from a question answering (QA) platform where urban neighbourhoods are discussed by users. In this context units of text often mention several aspects of one or more neighbourhoods. This is the first time that a generic social media platform in this case a QA platform, is used for fine-grained opinion mining. Text coming from QA platforms is far less constrained compared to text from review specific platforms which current datasets are based on. We develop several strong baselines, relying on logistic regression and state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 12 Oct 2016 16:23:11 GMT  (559kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03771v1", "Accepted at COLING 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at COLING 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marzieh saeidi", "guillaume bouchard", "maria liakata", "sebastian riedel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03771"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.03771.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "SentiHood: Targeted Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Dataset for Urban Neighbourhoods", "authors": ["Marzieh Saeidi", "Guillaume Bouchard", "Maria Liakata"], "emails": ["msaeidi@cs.ucl.ac.uk", "guillaume@bloomsbury.ai", "m.liakata@warwick.ac.uk", "sriedel@cs.ucl.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of us are able to surpass ourselves by putting ourselves at the centre of attention.

An additional aspect of Misc was considered. However, in the first round of comments, we realized that this had a negative impact on the determination of commentators and led to less general agreement.

Uncertain: When two conflicting feelings for the same location and aspect are expressed, for example, \"Like any other area, Camden Town has good and bad parts.\" Furthermore, if the opinion is expressed for one area without being directly mentioned in the sentences, for example, \"It is a very trendy area and not too far from King's Cross.\""}, {"heading": "2.7 Procedure:", "text": "We use the BRAT annotation tool (Stenetorp et al., 2012) and other tasks (Liakata pairs) to simplify the annotation task. Three annotators were initially selected for the task. None of the annotators is an expert in linguistics. Annotators started by reading the guidelines and examples, and each annotator then had to comment on a small subset of the data. After each round of annotators, agreements between annotators were calculated and discussed, and this process continued until they reached a reasonable agreement. 10% of the total annotator was randomly selected and commented by all three annotators. The annotator with the highest annotator match was selected to get all the data.Agreements: Cohen's Kappa coefficient (K) (COHEN, 1960) is often used to measure the paired match between the two annotators, the annotators being implicated for the task of the Aspect-based Annotator-based Annotator Analysis."}, {"heading": "2.8 Dataset", "text": "SentiHood currently contains annotated sentences containing one or two mentions of location units.2 SentiHood contains 5215 sentences with 3862 sentences containing a single location and 1353 sentences containing multiple (two) sites.Figure 1 shows the number of sentences labeled with each aspect, with mood broken down into \"positive\" or \"negative.\" \"Positive\" feelings are predominant for 2SentiHood data can be found at http: / / annotate-neighborhood.com / download / download.htmlaspects such as restaurants and shopping are queried. This shows that in some aspects people usually talk about areas that are good for them, as opposed to areas that are not. The general aspect is the most common aspect with over 2000 sentences, while aspect touristic occurs in less than 100 sentences. Note that since each sentence may contain one or more opinions, the total number of opinions (5920) in the dataset is higher than the number of location names and not assigned by the number of location names."}, {"heading": "3 Task", "text": "We define the task of purposeful aspect-based sentiment analysis as follows: A unit of text (e.g. a sentence) specifies a list of tuples (labels) {(l, a, p)} Tt = 0, where p is the polarity expressed for the aspect of unit l. Each sentence may have a number of tuples (labels) associated with it. In the context of current aspect-based sentiment analysis, three tasks are defined (Brychc\u0131n et al., 2014): detection of the aspect, detection of the opinion-goal expression, and detection of the feeling, whereby detection of the opinion-goal expression is an intermediate task for identifying the feeling of the spect.Here, we focus on identifying only the aspect and the feeling for each unit. Together, we identify each aspect, its relevant feeling, and the target-location unit by introducing a new polarity class called \"None.\" \"\" No standpoint indicates that an overall task, e.g., does not contain a three-class task for a pair."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "Most existing work in the field of aspect-based mood analysis, formula 1 measurement for the task of detecting aspects, and the accuracy of mood classification can be calculated using 2- or 3-class feelings (Pontiki et al., 2015). In our results, the F1 value is calculated with a threshold that is optimized during validation. We also propose the AUC measurement value (range below the ROC curve) for both aspect detection tasks and mood values. AUC captures the quality of the order of output scores and is not dependent on a threshold."}, {"heading": "5 Baseline", "text": "In all our methods we treat the task as a three-class classification for each aspect and use a Softmax function as follows: p (yl, a = c) = softmax (c) = exp (wc.el + bc) \u2211 Cc \u2032 = 1 exp (wc \u2032.el + bc \u2032) (1), where yl, a is the sentiment label of the aspect a for the location. wc and bC are the weights and distortions that are specific for each sensation class c. el is a representation of the location l. This representation can be a BoW or a distribution representation. Each method we propose here defines its own specific representation for el."}, {"heading": "5.1 Logistic Regression", "text": "Many existing work in the Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Task, 3 uses a classifier, such as logistic regression or SVM, based on linguistic characteristics such as n-grams, POS information or more hand-generated characteristics. We can imagine these characteristics as a sparse representation entered by Softmax in Equation 1. Specifically, we define the following sparse representations of locations: Mask target unit n-grams: For each location, we define an n-gram representation above the sentence and mask the destination with a special symbol. This can help distinguish between representations of two locations that are present in the same sentence. Left-right n-grams: We create an n-gram representation for both the right and left context around each location. We then link these two representations to obtain a single characteristic."}, {"heading": "5.2 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)", "text": "Inspired by the recent success of applying deep neural networks to language tasks, we use a bidirectional LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to learn a classifier for each of the aspects. Depictions for a location (el) are determined using one of the two following approaches: The final output state (LSTM - Final): el is the output embedding of the bidirectional LSTM.Location Output State (LSTM - Location): el is the output representation in the index corresponding to the location unit as shown in Figure 2.3, including participants in SemEval ABSA tasks 4http: / / ebiquity.umbc.edu / redirect / to / resource / id / 351 / UMBC-webbase-corpus"}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "In this thesis, we select the four most common aspects from the data set, which are: \"price,\" \"safety,\" \"transit location,\" and \"general,\" but the same approach can be applied to the other aspects. We share each collection of single and multiple site mentions in train, dev, and test set, each having 70%, 10%, and 20% of the data, respectively. We select the best model in terms of the dev set. In the case of LSTM, we evaluate the loss both on the training set and on the dev set after each iteration. We store the best model that has the lowest loss on the dev set over all iterations. We run this model on the test set and report the results separately on both categories of single site sets and judgments with two locations and on all the data in the test set. The results on individual site sets mainly show the model's ability to detect the right mood for an aspect."}, {"heading": "7 Results", "text": "Table 3 shows the results (averaged over all selected aspects) in terms of both F1 / accuracy and AUCs. It also shows the results of logistical regression models compared to LSTM models. As we can see, the N-gram representation with location masking achieves slightly better results compared to the left-right context. N-grams contain unique items and bigrams. We also achieve an increase in performance by adding POS information. We also experimented with the addition of tri-grams, but it did not have a positive effect on overall evaluations. The separation of the left and right context (LR-left-right) for the BoW representation does not improve performance. Left-right pooling of embedding that was weak compared to other representations, and therefore its results were neglected. Among the two variations of LSTM, the definitive state embedding model is slightly better than the model we are in."}, {"heading": "8 Related Work", "text": "The term sentiment analysis was first used in (et al, 2003), and since then the field has received much attention from both research and industry. Sentiment analysis has applications in almost all fields and raised many interesting research questions. In addition, the availability of a huge volume of idiosyncratic data on social media platforms has accelerated development in this field. Initially, work on sentiment analysis focused mainly on determining the general feeling of a text unit. The text unit differed from document (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002), paragraph or sentence (Hu and Liu, 2004), but only looking at general feeling fails to capture feelings about the aspects on which a unit can be checked or mood expressed toward different units. Two new tasks were introduced: aspect-based sentiment analysis and targeted sentiment analysis (Hu and Liu, 2004)."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we presented the task of a targeted aspect-based mood analysis and a new dataset. In addition, we offer two strong baselines using logistic regression and LSTM. Ways to improve baselines can be to identify the context of each site using parse trees. Data augmentation can be used to make the models, and LSTM in particular, more resilient to variations in the data. We also want to provide a more detailed analysis of what each system can achieve."}], "references": [{"title": "A Vector Space Approach for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis", "author": ["Abdulaziz Alghunaim."], "venue": "Ph.D. thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.", "citeRegEx": "Alghunaim.,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Alghunaim.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Care more about customers: unsupervised domain-independent aspect detection for sentiment analysis of customer reviews", "author": ["Ayoub Bagheri", "Mohamad Saraee", "Franciska De Jong."], "venue": "Knowledge-Based Systems, 52:201\u2013213.", "citeRegEx": "Bagheri et al\\.,? 2013", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bagheri et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "An unsupervised aspect-sentiment model for online reviews", "author": ["Samuel Brody", "Noemie Elhadad."], "venue": "Human Language Technologies: The 2010 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 804\u2013812.

The goal is to extract fine-grained information with respect to entities mentioned in user comments. This work extends both aspect-based sentiment analysis that assumes a single entity per document and targeted sentiment analysis that assumes a single sentiment towards a target entity. In particular, we identify the sentiment towards each aspect of one or more entities. As a testbed for this task, we introduce the SentiHood dataset, extracted from a question answering (QA) platform where urban neighbourhoods are discussed by users. In this context units of text often mention several aspects of one or more neighbourhoods. This is the first time that a generic social media platform in this case a QA platform, is used for fine-grained opinion mining. Text coming from QA platforms is far less constrained compared to text from review specific platforms which current datasets are based on. We develop several strong baselines, relying on logistic regression and state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
