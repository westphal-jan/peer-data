INTRODUCTIONA college student's life is multidimensional. Students are expected to be academically excellent, physically fit and socially active along with managing their daily tasks and pursuing their interests. This structure would not only help students engage in all activities, but also help them lead balanced lives. Ultimately, this practice would help them make better career decisions based on their interests. For such a practice, one must invest a threshold of time and effort in all activities. However, only a certain amount of students is involved and excel themselves in such a practice. Recently, various student problems have been addressed by researchers using Fuzzy Logic. Patel et al. [1] have evaluated the academic performance of students taking into account various factors such as attendance, internal exam, laboratory tasks and team work evaluation. Chrysafiadi and Virvou [2] have developed a blurred logic system that understands a student's process."}, {"heading": "A. About Fuzzy Logic", "text": "One of the reasons for such momentary growth since its inception is its applicability in all sectors, be it dynamic programming, process control, or optimization. Blurred logic rejects the theory of \"absolute truth\" and instead proposes a new theory of \"partial truth,\" also referred to as the degree of membership (proposed by Zadeh 1965) [8]. Consider S as a non-empty set designated as a universe set. Now, consider any crisp set A-S. A characteristic function is defined as A (x) = {1, if x-A-0, otherA characteristic function assigns to each element of S either a value of 0 or 1. Let's consider a blurred set B-S. A membership function is defined as \u00b5B (x): S \u2192 [0, 1]. In contrast to the notion of a set in classical set theory, in which an element either belongs to a particular element or is not specified as a group 9, a blurred number results from a group 9."}, {"heading": "B. Problem Formulation", "text": "The problem can be divided into three main parts: \u2022 Data collection: Using the GPS and Google Places API, data collection of all visited locations and the time the user spends in each location. \u2022 Fuzzification: Blur the crisp inputs and calculate the values of the corresponding membership functions. \u2022 Defuzzification: Create a fuzzy inference system based on specific rules and then return recommendations and suggestions."}, {"heading": "II.

Fuzzification", "text": "Fuzzification of time: Consider a person p. Suppose p visits tags {x1, x2,.., xn}, where the time spent in these places is denoted by {Y (x1), Y (x2),.., Y (xn). Let KH, KL, KO define the total time spent in the areas of health, leisure, social, work and other categories. ThenKH = \u2211 xi, H Y (xi) + \u03c4HSimilarly, KW, KL, KO are defined. We define the following fuzzy sets for all categories. These sets define the type of lifestyle that a person lives in each category. Here, leisure also includes rest.health = {unfit, fit, proactive} leisure = {hectic, lazy} social = {reserved, sociable, over social} work = {lethargic, diligent} other = {non-productive}."}, {"heading": "C. Defuzzification", "text": "Considering the input data Y (x), Zi (x), \u03c4i and \u0441i, where x-X and i = S, L, O, W, H can each be calculated a corresponding Ki and Mi. Based on surveys, membership functions for all linguistic terms in all categories can be determined both for the merging of time and for scoring. Therefore, the membership value of Ki and Wed in each category depends on all linguistic terms. Let {R1, R2,.., RN} be a set of recommendations. Now, each Rk (1 \u2264 k \u2264 N) will depend on a set of linguistic terms. For example, a recommendation R = \"All work and no play can make Jack a boring boy.\" is surpassed if a person spends too much time and effort at work and less in his leisure and social life."}, {"heading": "III. EXPERIMENT", "text": "A survey conducted at IIT Kharagpur identified all the membership features for all language terms in all categories. Some of the membership features are presented in this essay. The mobile application was installed on the student's phone and the results were analyzed. A randomly selected student was selected and his data for the day analyzed. Table III shows the tags he visited all day, and their corresponding time and weighting. Also, the score for each day is enumerated. Table IV shows the total time and score in all categories.

CONCLUDING REMARKS", "text": "The dynamics of a student studying at University A and a student at University B can vary greatly due to many factors such as geographical location, nature of the university and infrastructure, so the parameters for analyzing these two students should be significantly different. This paper gives the user the flexibility to configure various attributes such as weight of tags, type of membership features and number of recommendations, which would provide better outcomes. Long-term applications are extensive, and this method can be used to access the performance of all students at a university, and the results can be shared with the university so that the university can take appropriate action for the benefit of students in general."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors thank Professor Sudhirkumar Barai of the Institute of Civil Engineering at IIT Kharagpur for his continued and unconditional guidance.
