Importantly, CCN routers may locally cache frequently requested content in order to speed up delivery to end users. Thus, the issue of caching strategies arises, i.e., which content shall be stored and when it should be replaced. In this work, we employ novel techniques towards intelligent administration of CCN routers that autonomously switch between existing strategies in response to changing content request patterns. In particular, we present a router architecture for CCN networks that is controlled by rule-based stream reasoning, following the recent formal framework LARS which extends Answer Set Programming for streams. The obtained possibility for flexible router configuration at runtime allows for faster experimentation and may thus help to advance the further development of CCN. Moreover, the empirical evaluation of our feasibility study shows that the resulting caching agent may give significant performance gains.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 10:08:37 GMT  (793kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04005v1", "21 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NI", "authors": ["harald beck", "bruno bierbaumer", "minh dao-tran", "thomas eiter", "hermann hellwagner", "konstantin schekotihin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.04005"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.04005.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Stream Reasoning-Based Control of Caching Strategies in CCN Routers", "authors": ["Harald Beck", "Bruno Bierbaumer", "Minh Dao-Tran", "Thomas Eiter", "Hermann Hellwagner", "Konstantin Schekotihin"], "emails": ["beck@kr.tuwien.ac.at", "dao@kr.tuwien.ac.at", "eiter@kr.tuwien.ac.at", "bruno@itec.aau.at,", "firstname.lastname@aau.at"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be a matter of time before it is so far, until it is so far."}, {"heading": "2 Content-Centric Networking", "text": "The operation of a CCN network is based on two types of packets, interest and data packets. Customers issue interest packets that contain the content name they want to retrieve. CCN routers forward the interest packets until they reach a content provider who can satisfy them with the content addressed by the content name. Content providers respond with a data packet that returns to the original content consumer after the previous interest packets. In addition to delivering the data packets back to the consumer, CCN routers have the ability to store these packets in their content stores, enabling another consumer's interest packets to be satisfied directly from a content store without having to go all the way to the original content provider. These caches make it possible to keep popular content close to the consumer, satisfy content requests directly from caches, and reduce the network load.

During the operation of a router, the network unit examines the selected caching strategy of the controller to identify video chunks to be stored in the cache. When the cache is full, the strategy also decides which cache chunk to replace. In the face of a non-empty cache, the network unit checks whether it can be answered with hacked chunks.Decision units. The decision unit of an ICA consists of three main components: (1) a database (DB) that stores snapshots of parameters observed by the controller (2)."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation", "text": "Section 4 proposed an agent-based caching system using a decision component written in LARS.

Network. As already mentioned, many more strategies need to be implemented before CCNs can be used in real world applications. Consequently, empirical CCN research relies on simulations to determine the effects of caching within the network. Network topologies are collected and made publicly available before CCNs are used in the real world. From these, we chose the Abilene network because it has plausible topological properties of a future CCN network. From a practical perspective (i.e. to limit the runtime of our simulations), images are also suitable for its low number of routers. Figure 4 illustrates this topology, where the nodes are n0, n10 routers."}, {"heading": "5.2 Performance Metrics", "text": "We use the cache hit rate and the cache hit rate as performance indicators. Both indicators are typically used by the CCN community to evaluate caching mechanisms [31].Cache hit rate. The cache hit rate is defined as h / req, where h is the number of cache hits and req is the number of requests. A cache hit is counted when an interest packet can be satisfied by a router's content store. In addition to the overall hit rate, we also measure the development of cache hits every second. This gives us a detailed insight into the performance of the system at any time. The better the cache system works, the higher the hit rate is, resulting in a reduction in network load and access latencies [31]. Cache hit distance. The cache hit distance is the average number of hops for a data packet, i.e. the number of routers that are placed between the router and the consumer to answer a request."}, {"heading": "5.3 Execution", "text": "The simulation was performed in two steps. First, we had to determine an appropriate cache size based on basic caching strategies. Then, after determining the cache size, we proceeded with a detailed analysis of various static and dynamic caching strategies.Step 1: Determining the cache size. In the first step, based on the selected network topology and for each of the cache percentages (p = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 4, 10), we executed 30 times 2 basic strategies (LFU, random) in 1 scenario (LHL).The goal of all 300 individual runs was to evaluate how the cache hit rate behaves in relation to the cache size. Figure 5 shows that the aggregate cache hit rates of the 30 independent LFU strategies and random caching strategies vary."}, {"heading": "5.4 Results", "text": "We will now present the results of our simulations. First, we will analyze the behavior of the considered strategies during a single run. Then, we will examine the effects of switching strategies. Simulation Run Analysis Reacting to Changing Content Access. Figure 6 shows the evolution of cache hits over time during a single simulation run for Scenario LHL. First, we will find that the number of active users (right axis) initially increases rapidly and then differs only slightly by an average of about 95. Thus, the sudden increase in cache hits between seconds 600 and 700, and the sudden decrease after seconds 1200, cannot be attributed to a changing number of users. Clearly, these changes are due to the induced change in content interest patterns, first from the first L phase (low value) to the middle H phase (high value) and then back from H to L. The cache hit increase after 600 seconds is observed for all caching strategies."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We presented a comprehensive feasibility study on how reasoning techniques can be used for adaptive configuration tasks that depend on streaming data. Specifically, we provided an architecture for the simulation of potential caching strategies in future content-centric networks. Our empirical evaluations suggest that dynamic switching of caching strategies in response to changing user behavior can bring significant savings in terms of performance gains. We focused on a principled approach of automated decision-making using high-level reasoning on stream data and provided a purely explanatory control unit. In order to obtain a program from our formal LARS models, we implemented plug-ins for DLVHEX. The resulting coding is similar to the mathematical counterpart, i.e. a fragment of LARS. Specifically, more comprehensive industrial solutions require much more complex decision rules and processes, and fast assessments of which ARS would have to be directly invested in the case of determining the critical importance of ARS."}], "references": [{"title": "The CQL continuous query language: semantic foundations and query execution", "author": ["A.

Importantly, CCN routers may locally cache frequently requested content in order to speed up delivery to end users. Thus, the issue of caching strategies arises, i.e., which content shall be stored and when it should be replaced. In this work, we employ novel techniques towards intelligent administration of CCN routers that autonomously switch between existing strategies in response to changing content request patterns. In particular, we present a router architecture for CCN networks that is controlled by rule-based stream reasoning, following the recent formal framework LARS which extends Answer Set Programming for streams. The obtained possibility for flexible router configuration at runtime allows for faster experimentation and may thus help to advance the further development of CCN. Moreover, the empirical evaluation of our feasibility study shows that the resulting caching agent may give significant performance gains.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
