It employs a weighted combination of the available predictors (i.e., the target and source predictors) and guarantees convergence to the best weighted predictor. Furthermore, the use of Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) allows for using more than a single source domains, since it may facilitate the fit of a single model on more than one source domains (houses).

Instead, if the developed (online) prediction model was also used to provide predictions under an MPC formulation, the training data were generated under the currently implemented MPC. The details of these experiments will be discussed in a forthcoming section (Section 6.3).

Weather data were collected from Washington, DC, (source house) and from Linz, Austria, (target house) from November to March 2009. In Experiment 3, the target house also has different presence patterns. Presence patterns differ in the definition of the number of people of a certain age and gender, as well as their activities (for further details see [6]).

Furthermore, the combined source house predictor can be combined with the target house regressor using GOTL.For our evaluation, we use 2 source houses. Weather data from both source houses come from Washington, D.C. Source house regressor 2 is three times the size of source house regressor 1. The target house used is twice the size of source house regressor 1 and uses weather data from Linz, Austria. All three houses allow for a different presence pattern. The results are shown in Figure 4. It can be observed that the combined source house regressor is much better than the use of one of the source house regressor houses alone. One reason for the good source house performance is that the coefficients for the source house regressor the target house 3 are better than the comparable source house or shelf house paragraph 3."}, {"heading": "6.3.

Conclusions & Future Work", "text": "We introduced the online transfer learning system GOTL, which is applicable for classification and regression tasks and makes it possible to optimally combine an (offline) source domain predictor with an online target domain predictor. Results showed the benefit of the combined predictor for significantly improving the prediction accuracy in the first weeks and months of a new building - compared to the sole use of the source house or target house predictor. Further improvements in prediction accuracy can be achieved by facilitating multiple source houses and TCA. Improvements in prediction accuracy also lead to significant energy savings with given comfort. Also important is the adaptive response of the proposed online transfer learning algorithm. Although the above experiments were evaluated over a period of five winter months, training an online regressor over longer periods of time can be challenging. This is primarily due to changes in weather conditions or heating behavior of a predisposition in such a GOL."}, {"heading": "8.

In transfer learning, prediction models trained under a set of available data from a target domain (e.g., house with limited data) can be improved through the use of data generated from similar source domains (e.g., houses with rich data). Given also the need for prediction models that can be trained online (e.g., as part of a model-predictive-control implementation), this paper introduces the generalized online transfer learning algorithm (GOTL). It employs a weighted combination of the available predictors (i.e., the target and source predictors) and guarantees convergence to the best weighted predictor. Furthermore, the use of Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) allows for using more than a single source domains, since it may facilitate the fit of a single model on more than one source domains (houses). This allows GOTL to transfer knowledge from more than one source domains. We further validate our results through experiments in climate control for residential buildings and show that GOTL may lead to non-negligible energy savings for given comfort levels.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
