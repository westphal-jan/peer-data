If we compare the results of PTransR with the results of previous models, we have the following main observations: (1) PTransR performs significantly better than TransR on each measure, showing that path-enlarged models can achieve better results than one-hop base models. (2) PTransR performs better than PTransE on MeanRank and is comparable to PTransE in Hits @ 10, showing that path-aggregated models with a better one-hop base model can achieve better results. Table 3 shows the performance in the four relation categories 1-to-1, 1-to-n, n-to-1 and n-to-n, with Hits @ 10 (filters) being the measurement. Table 3 shows that PTransR has consistent imports compared to TransR in all four relation categories."}, {"heading": "3.4 In-Depth Analysis and Discussion", "text": "As shown in Section 1, despite the massive pull rate of FB15k, some relationships cannot be properly captured due to the problem of data sparseness. We divide the relationships into five groups according to their frequency in the pull rate, as shown in Table 4. The mean rank (raw) of TransR and PTransR is compared in Table 4 and the improvement from TransR to PTransR is illustrated. First, we see that PTransR performs better than TransR in all five relationship groups. Second, as the frequency of relations decreases, the improvement increases, which means that path information is useful for dealing with the problem of data sparseness."}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "Relationship extraction is an important research topic in the NLP. It can be roughly divided into two categories based on the source of information.Text-based approaches to extracting units and / or relationships from plaintext. For example, Hearst [17] uses \"is a | an\" pattern to extract hyponymy relations. Banko et al. [6] proposes to extract open domain relationships from the Web. Fully supervised relationship extraction, which divides two marked units into several predefined relationships, has become a hot research arena in recent years [18,19,8].The completion of the knowledge base / population, on the other hand, does not use additional text. Socher et al. [20] suggest a tensor model for predicting missing relationships in an existing knowledge base, which shows the ability of neural networks to draw conclusions from entity relationships. Then, approaches to translating embeddings to complete the knowledge base are proposed [11,12,14]."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we complement the one-hop TransR model with a path modeling method that leads to the PTransR model. We evaluate PTransR by task of predicting entities and compare the performance of PTransR with that of previous models.
