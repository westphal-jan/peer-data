Most previous approaches focus on the shilling attacks, where the attack organizer fakes a large number of user profiles by the same strategy to promote or demote an item. In this paper, we study a different attack style: unorganized malicious attacks, where attackers respectively use a small number of user profiles to attack their own target items without any organizer. This attack style occurs in many real applications, yet relevant study remains open. In this paper, we formulate the unorganized malicious attacks detection as a variant of matrix completion problem, and prove that attackers can be detected theoretically. We propose the Unorganized Malicious Attacks detection (UMA) algorithm, which can be viewed as a proximal alternating splitting augmented Lagrangian method. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 14:02:49 GMT  (453kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04086v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["ming pang", "wei gao", "min tao", "zhi-hua zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.04086"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.04086.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Unorganized Malicious Attacks Detection", "authors": ["Ming Pang", "Wei Gao", "Zhi-Hua Zhou"], "emails": ["pangm@lamda.nju.edu.cn", "gaow@lamda.nju.edu.cn", "taom@nju.edu.cn", "zhouzh@lamda.nju.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Detection of attacks, Recommendation systems, Method of changing direction, Advanced Lagrange method"}, {"heading": "1.

Related Work", "text": "The core assumption of CF is that if users express similar interests in the past, they will share a common interest in the future (Goldberg et al., 1992). However, significant progress in terms of CF evaluations has been made since then (Bresler et al., 2014; Li et al., 2009; Rao et al., 2015; Salakhutdinov et al., 2007). There are two main categories of conventional CF evaluation methods (based on user matrix evaluation) that are memory-based and model-based CF algorithms that are memory-based CF algorithms and model-based CF algorithms that base user evaluation on all or part of the user strategy. It can be divided into user-based and item-based CF-based CF approaches. A typical user-based CF approach predicts a user's evaluation by aggregating some user similarities."}, {"heading": "3.

Therefore, we have the operator of the linear transformation that acts on matrices as < X, X >. Let's also designate the operator of the linear transformation that acts on the space of the matrices, and we designate the linear space of the matrices that is based on it when it is clear from the context.

The Proposed Approach", "text": "It is quite difficult to optimize the formulations of Eqns.

This attack style occurs in many real applications, yet relevant study remains open. In this paper, we formulate the unorganized malicious attacks detection as a variant of matrix completion problem, and prove that attackers can be detected theoretically. We propose the Unorganized Malicious Attacks detection (UMA) algorithm, which can be viewed as a proximal alternating splitting augmented Lagrangian method. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
