[For example, if we have a CNF formula with n variables and m clauses with the property that each clause contains at least k variables and each variable, if we stick to most d clauses that we ask: Question 1.1. How must the problem relate to d to estimate the number of satisfactory mappings that occur within a (1 \u00b1 1 / nc) multiplicative factor in most monotonous CNF formulas being equivalent to the following: Suppose we are given a hypergraph on n nodes and m hyperedges with the property that each hyperedge contains at least k nodes and each node belongs to the most d hyperedges. How must k react to d to approximate the number of independent clauses to be compatible?"}, {"heading": "1.2 Our Results", "text": "Our main result is an algorithm to approximate the number of solutions when k is at least logarithmic in d. In what follows, we let c, k, and d be constants. We prove 1: Theorem 1.3 (informal). Suppose it is a CNF formula with at least k variables per clause and most d clauses containing a variable. For each k \u2265 20 protocol d there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to approximate the number of satisfactory assignments within a multiplicative (1 \u00b1 1 / nc) factor. In addition, there is a randomized polynomial time algorithm to find a sample from a distribution that is 1 / nc-close to the total variation in order to approximate the distribution to satisfactory assignments. This algorithm closes an exponential gap between the known upper [5, 4] and lower [4] boundaries. It also shows that a lack of a local locus is not possible to find only satisfactory conditions."}, {"heading": "1.3 Further Applications", "text": "Our algorithms have an interesting application in graphical models. Directed graphical models are a rich language for describing distributions by the conditional relations of their variables. However, algorithmically, very little is known about learning these variables or performing basic tasks such as inference. In most settings, these problems are mathematically difficult. However, we can study an interesting class of directed graphical models, which we call causer-pays networks. See Figure 1.Definition 1.4. In a causer-pays network, there is a collection of hidden variables x1, x2,... xn, which are independently selected to be T or F with equal probability. There is a collection of m observed variables, each of which is either an OR or AND of several variables or their negations. Our goal is: Given a random sample x1, x2,... xn from the model in which we observe the truth value of each of the m clauses is a variable."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "We will assume that there are n variables and there are m clauses that allow us to approximately count the number of satisfactory assignments in polynomial time.

Next, if we scan a variable y, then Corollary 2.3 tells us that regardless of whether x = T or x = F, each clause has at least k \u2212 1 variables left, and therefore the boundary distribution on y must still be close to the total variable distance. Therefore, we will try to couple the conditional distributions when we start from x = T or x = F as well as possible to show that the boundary distribution on variables that are all at least a bit away must converge in the total variable distance. However, there is an important catch that motivates the need for a solution. Imagine that we continue in this way by sampling variables from the corresponding conditional distribution. We can achieve a situation where a clause c has set all variables apart from y and yet the clause is still not satisfactory.The strategy is still uneven."}, {"heading": "3.2 Factorizing Formulas", "text": "Now we will build two sub-allotments and use the notation A1 (x) = T and A2 (x) = F to indicate that the first sub-allotment x sets T and the second x sets F. Also, we will refer to the conditional distribution, which is uniform in all satisfactory assignments in accordance with the decisions made so far in A1 and D1. Likewise, we will refer to the conditional distribution other than D2. Note that these distributions will be updated as more variables are set. We can now set out our goal. Let's say we have sub-allotments A1 and A2. Then we will want to write sentences that contain A1 = \u03a6I1, where \u03a6A1 is the subformula we get after we have made the assignments in A1, and simplify - i.e. remove variables that are F and delete clauses that already have a variable on T."}, {"heading": "3.3 Factorization via Coupling", "text": "We assume that we can continue to sample the variables in S 1 and A2, and we are now sure that the full mapping is derived from the assignments to A2.

We can continue to sample the variables in S 2, and we are now sure that the full mapping is derived from the assignments in A2."}, {"heading": "3.4 How Quickly Does the Coupling Procedure Terminate?", "text": "What remains is the probability that the number of variables contained in VI is at most t. First, we need an elementary definition: Definition 3.7. If a variable xi contains different truth assignments in A1 and A2, we can call it an error of type 1 and type 2. In any case, these are the only reasons why a variable in VI is included in an execution of the coupling procedure: Observation 1. All variables in VI are contained either due to a type 1 error or a type 2 error. Now, our approach is to show that VI does not contain too many variables with a high probability, if there were to be a large collection of disjoint errors. First, we construct a useful diagram underlying the process: Definition 3.8 G."}, {"heading": "4 Implications of the Coupling Procedure", "text": "In this section we give an abstraction that allows us to think about the coupling procedure as a randomly selected procedure = VI = according to the principle of the root-to-lef path in a particular tree whose nodes represent states. First, we make an elementary observation that will be useful in the discussion about how this tree is constructed. Remember that the coupling procedure selects any clause that contains variables in both VI and VO and then samples of all variables marked therein. We assume without loss of generality that the decisions it makes are made in lexicographic order. So, if the clauses in this procedure are arbitrarily assigned as c1, c2,...., cm and the variables are assigned as x1, x2,..., xn when executing the WHILE loop, if there is a selection of more than one clause, it selects among them the clause that we will associate with the lowest procedure we will go with the most important subscript we associate with it in the next item."}, {"heading": "5 Certifying the Marginal Distribution", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 One-Sided Stochastic Decision Trees", "text": "The stochastic decision structure that we have defined in the previous section is a natural representation of the trajectory of the coupling method = 1. However, it has an important drawback that we will remedy here. Its crucial property is captured in Lemma 4.6, which results in a relationship between (1) Pi - the conditional probability of mapping in accordance with Ai and (2) Ni - the number of mappings in accordance with Ai for i = 1, 2. However, p1 is the product of different probability ratios along the root-to-leaf path. This means that if we think of transition probabilities as variables, the constraint imposed by Lemma 4.6 is far from linear. In this section, we will transform a stochastic decision tree into two separate trees that we call unilaterally stochastic decision trees. We will have the property that the constraint imposed by Lemma 4.6 will be linear in the variables."}, {"heading": "5.2 An Algorithm for Finding a Valid S1 and S2", "text": "s leave q = PrD [x = T] and q \u00b2 \u2264 q. \"Then there are two unilateral stochastic decision trees S1 and S2, which, for each pair of matching root-to-leaf paths ending in u and u, each fulfill (q\" 1 \u2212 q \") p2N2 \u2264 p1N1\" (q \"1 \u2212 q\") p2N2 where N1 and N2 are number of satisfactory mappings consistent with A1 and A2, and p1 and p2 are the overall probability of maintenance in u and u. \"In addition, q\" and q \"\u2212 \u00b2 \u00b2,\" which q \"\u2264 q\" \u00b2 \"fulfill, an algorithm exists to construct two unilateral stochastic decision trees S1 and S2 that fulfill the above condition."}, {"heading": "5.3 A Fractional Matching to Certify q", "text": "We are now ready to prove the second major law theory of this section.

approach for approximately counting in bounded degree systems with higher-order constraints. Our main result is an algorithm to approximately count the number of solutions to a CNF formula \u03a6 with at least k variables per clause and degree at most d when k is logarithmic in d. This closes an exponential gap between the known upper and lower bounds. Moreover our algorithm extends straightforwardly to approximate sampling, which shows that under Lov\u00e1sz Local Lemma-like conditions it is not only possible to find a satisfying assignment, it is also possible to generate one approximately uniformly at random from the set of all satisfying assignments. Our approach is a significant departure from earlier techniques in approximate counting, and is based on a framework to bootstrap an oracle for computing marginal probabilities on individual variables. Finally, we give an application of our results to show that it is algorithmically possible to sample from the posterior distribution in an interesting class of graphical models. \u2217Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
