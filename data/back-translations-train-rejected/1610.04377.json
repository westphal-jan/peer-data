In addition, the Indian subcontinent suffered seven earthquakes in 2015, with the recent earthquake in Nepal alone killing more than 9,000 people and injuring 23,008. We believe that we can leverage current social media activity on the web to minimize losses by quickly connecting the affected people and the affected authorities. Our work is motivated by the following factors: (a) Social media is very accessible in the current scenario. (The Digital India initiative promotes Internet activity and therefore requires proactive social activities7 http: / / www.indiaspend.com / cover-story / fire-kill-54-every-day-yetdead-have-sunk-81400 8 https: / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / April 2015 Nepal earthquakemedia)."}, {"heading": "3 Our Approach", "text": "Tweets are manually labeled < emergency > and < non-emergency > and then manually classified to provide labels according to the type of emergency they specify. We use the manually labeled data to train our classifiers. We use traditional classification techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) for training, and perform 10-fold cross-validation to obtain f-scores. Later, in real time, our system uses Twitter streaming APIs to obtain data, processes it with the same modules, and detects emergencies using the classifiers created above. Tweets referring to emergencies are displayed on the web interface along with the location and information for the authorities concerned. Pre-processing of the Twitter data received is necessary as it typically sees ad-hoc abbreviations, phrases, substitutions for the use of foreign words, and the use of URONs for the labels."}, {"heading": "3.1 Pre-Processing Modules", "text": "In fact, it is a way in which most people are able to survive on their own, and in which most of them are not able to integrate, \"he told the German Press Agency in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag \":\" I don't think we will be able to put the world in order. \""}, {"heading": "3.2 Emergency Classification", "text": "The first classification model acts as a filter for the second level of classification. We use both SVM and NB to compare the results, and later choose SVM for Stage 11 http: / / sourceforge.net / projects / jazzy / one classification model, based on a better F score. The training is conducted on tweets labeled \"Emergency\" and \"Non-Emergency,\" based on unigrams as characteristics. We create word vectors of strings in the tweet using a filter available in the WEKA API [6], and perform cross-validations using standard classification techniques."}, {"heading": "3.3 Type Classification", "text": "We use a multi-level Naive Bayes classifier as a second classification mechanism to categorize tweets accordingly, depending on the type of emergencies they display. This multi-level classifier is trained on data manually labeled with classes. We tokenize the training data with the \"NgramTokenizer\" and then apply a filter before training to create word vectors of strings. We use \"trigrams\" as characteristics to create a model that later divides tweets into appropriate categories in real time. We then perform cross-validation using standard techniques to calculate the results displayed under the \"Level 2\" label in Table 4."}, {"heading": "3.4 Location Visualizer", "text": "We use Google Maps Geocoding API12 to show the possible location of the tweet based on longitude and latitude. Our visualizer presents the user with a map and locates the location with custom icons for earthquakes, hurricanes, fire accidents, etc. As we are currently collecting tweets with a location filter for the city of Mumbai, we display the map location on the user interface. The possible events of such incidents will appear on the map as soon as our system is able to detect them. We also show the same on an Android device using the WebView functionality available to developers, solving the portability problem. Our system shows visualization of the various emergencies that are detected on both web browsers and mobile devices."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "We evaluate our system using automated and manual evaluation techniques. We perform a 10-fold cross-validation to obtain the F-scores for our classification systems. We use the following technique to create data sets. We test System12 https: / / developers.google.com / maps / documentation / geocodingin real time and tweet about fires in random locations in our city with test accounts. Our system was able to detect such tweets and identify them from the locations shown on the map."}, {"heading": "4.1 Dataset Creation", "text": "For our experiments, we collect 3,200 tweets, which are filtered by keywords such as \"fire,\" \"earthquake,\" \"theft,\" \"robbery,\" \"drunk driving,\" \"drunk driving,\" etc. Later, we manually label tweets with < emergency > and < non-emergency > to classify them as level one. Our data set contains 1313 tweets with positive labeling < emergency > and 1887 tweets with negative labeling < non-emergency >. We create another dataset of positive labeling tweets and label them with category labels such as \"fire,\" \"accident,\" \"earthquake,\" etc."}, {"heading": "4.2 Classifier Evaluation", "text": "The results of the ten-fold cross-validation carried out for level one are shown in Table 4, under the label \"level 1.\" In Table 4, for \"level 1\" of the classification, the F score achieved with the SVM classifier is 72.5%, as in line 2, column 2. We also provide sample tweets to the system in real time and evaluate its ability to detect the emergency and classify accordingly. The classification training for level 1 was conducted using two traditional classification techniques SVM and NB. SVM has outperformed NB by about 4% and was selected for the classification techniques for level 1. Some false positives obtained during the manual assessment are: \"I am sooo drunk right now wwww\" and \"Fire in my office, the boss is angry.\" These incidents show the need for more labeled gold data for our classifiers, and some other features obtained during the manual evaluation, so I am intoxicated in my office. \""}, {"heading": "5 Demostration Description", "text": "Users interact with Civique through its web-based user interface and Android-based application interface. Civique's underlying features are demonstrated using the following two examples: Showcase 1: Tweet Detection and Classification This showcase aims to detect related tweets and classify them into appropriate categories. To this end, we have created a list of filter words that are used to filter tweets from the Twitter Streaming API. These groups of words help us filter tweets related to each incident. We tweet, and users are able to see how our system collects and classifies such tweets. Users should be able to see the tweet appear as an incident on the web interface, as shown in Figure 3 and in the Android application, how a notification is generated when our system detects and classifies an emergency tweet. If a user clicks on the tweet that pops up, the system should be able to show the Tweet in the version that has been extracted / filed."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "Civique is a system that recognizes urban emergencies such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, accidents, etc., and visualizes them both on a browsable web interface and on an Android application. We collect data from the popular microblogging site Twitter and use language processing modules to clean up the input. We use this data as input to train a two-step classification system that indicates whether a tweet is related to an emergency or not, and if so, what category it belongs to. We display such positively classified tweets along with their nature and location on a Google map and notify our users to notify the affected authorities and potentially evacuate the area if its location matches the affected area. We believe that such a system can help the civil protection machinery, and government agencies such as firefighters, police, etc., to act quickly and thus minimize loss of life. Twitter users use slang, profanity, neologisms, and multiple methods to combine the current system to detect events."}], "references": [{"title": "EvenTweet: online localized event detection from twitter", "author": ["H.
