INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "1.1. PROBLEM DEFINITION", "text": "Consider the case when N number of sensor nodes is used in a sensor network with locations L = {L1, L2,..., LN}. Let Lxi, Lyi, Lzi specify the x, y and z coordinates of the th sensor node. The problem of node localization involves the determination of these locations and by allowing Lzi = 0 you get a problem with 2 dimensions. Sensor nodes with knowledge of their positions are known as anchors or beacons. All nodes in the network with unknown position localize themselves with the help of these anchor nodes. Therefore, the localization problem of the node is mathematically described as follows: for a certain multi-hop WSN, represented by a graph G = (V, E) with an anchor node with positions {xa, ya} for all A, we want the position {xu, yu} for all nodes with unknown position u = U."}, {"heading": "2.

Experimental Setup", "text": "The formation and testing of a neural network requires a dataset [15], [26] The dataset in this study is compiled by collecting the RSSI measurements for each mobile node indicating the position of the I. Reference point. For indoor localization, the structure of the room or experimental environment is an important factor [27]. Measurements were taken in a research laboratory containing furniture and equipment such as tables, chairs and computers. The structure of the measured training data is 9 x 11 measuring points (black dots), as shown in Figure 4. The distance between the grid points is 0.45 m. Measurements of the training positions and unknown positions were used for the tests. The unknown positions were selected between the training points, as shown in Figure 4.The anchor configurations used for this research to determine the best anchor points are 2 anchors (consisting of: (a) anchors 2 & 4 (b), 4 (4) anchors (4) (4) (1), 4 (1) anchors (1)."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "A new-fangled network requires superordinate learning and for this research five different training algorithms, namely LM, RP, SCG and GD, which were used to train the neural network. A number of tests were performed with different activation functions and nodes. A network with three layers was used for the hidden layers, while a pure line function was used in the first and second layers (the hidden layers) and two nodes in the initial layer."}, {"heading": "4.1. COMPARISON WITH OTHER RELATED LITERATURE", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is not a purely formal matter, but a purely formal matter, which is a purely formal matter."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "An efficient 2D localization algorithm for WSN was proposed by the use of ANN. Different configurations of anchor nodes were evaluated, which can be used by the researchers in selecting the number of anchor nodes to be used depending on the application environment. Input into the proposed method is the RSSI values of the signal received by the anchor nodes. As all sensor nodes are equipped with RF modules for wireless communication, no external hardware is required. Therefore, the proposed method is energy efficient and uses only a double message to obtain the inputs for the localization. However, it is recommended that the RSSI value of the localization signals received by the anchor nodes is also used, which may lead to a further reduction of the localization error. To obtain the best neural network for localization, the BR training algorithm is evaluated to provide the best result of the localization signals received by the anchor nodes, which may lead to a further reduction of the localization error."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This research was fully supported by the College Research Committee of Fiji National University."}], "references": [{"title": "Localization algorithms in wireless sensor networks: current approaches and future challenges", "author": ["Pal"], "venue": "Network Protocols and Algorithms, vol. 2, pp. 45-74, 2010.", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2010}, {"title": "A Fuzzy Set- Based Approach to Range-Free Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks", "author": ["A.S.

industrial domain, many research opportunities are emerging. One such essential and challenging application is that of node localization. A feed-forward neural network based methodology is adopted in this paper. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values of the anchor node beacons are used. The number of anchor nodes and their configurations has an impact on the accuracy of the localization system, which is also addressed in this paper. Five different training algorithms are evaluated to find the training algorithm that gives the best result. The multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model was trained using Matlab. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in real time, the model obtained was then implemented on the Arduino microcontroller. With four anchor nodes, an average 2D localization error of 0.2953 m has been achieved with a 12-12-2 neural network structure. The proposed method can also be implemented on any other embedded microcontroller system.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
