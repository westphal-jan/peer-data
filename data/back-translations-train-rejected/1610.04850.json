The question is how to build a seed set that can give enough preference information for making good recommendations. One of the most successful approaches, called Representative Based Matrix Factorization, is based on Maxvol algorithm. Unfortunately, this approach has one important limitation --- a seed set of a particular size requires a rating matrix factorization of fixed rank that should coincide with that size. This is not necessarily optimal in the general case. In the current paper, we introduce a fast algorithm for an analytical generalization of this approach that we call Rectangular Maxvol. It allows the rank of factorization to be lower than the required size of the seed set. Moreover, the paper includes the theoretical analysis of the method's error, the complexity analysis of the existing methods and the comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 16 Oct 2016 12:50:37 GMT  (98kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04850v1", "IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["alexander fonarev", "alexander mikhalev", "pavel serdyukov", "gleb gusev", "ivan oseledets"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.04850"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.04850.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Efficient Rectangular Maximal-Volume Algorithm for Rating Elicitation in Collaborative Filtering", "authors": ["Alexander Fonarev", "Alexander Mikhalev", "Pavel Serdyukov", "Gleb Gusev", "Ivan Oseledets"], "emails": ["newo@newo.su,", "aleksandr.mikhalev@kaust.edu.sa,", "gleb57}@yandex-team.ru,", "i.oseledets@skoltech.ru"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it is only a matter of time before a solution is found, in which a solution is found."}, {"heading": "II.

Rating elicitation scheme", "text": "The evaluation methods, such as [6], [8], [11], [12], are effectively based on the same common scheme introduced in this section. Suppose we have a system that contains a history of user ratings for articles, in which only a few articles can be rated by a particular user. Name the rating matrix by R-Rn-m, where n is the number of users and m is the number of articles, and the value of your entry rui describes user feedback u on point i. If the rating for pair (u, i) is unknown, then rui is set to 0. Without loss of generality and due to the spatial limitation, the following description of the methods is provided only for the user cold start problem. Without modifications, these methods can be used for the user cold start problem to solve the item cold start problem after the matrix rate has been implemented."}, {"heading": "B. PureSVD", "text": "Let us briefly describe the general idea of PureSVD, which is a very effective CF method in terms of ranking metrics [4] and is therefore used as a basis for our evaluation approach. PureSVD offers a solution to the following optimization problem: EQ-R-P > Q-F \u2192 min P-Rf \u00b7 n Q-Rf \u00b7 m, (1) where | | \u00b7 | | F is the Frobenius standard and f is a classified parameter of PureSVD. According to the Eckart-Young theorem [13], the optimal solution can be found by calculating the truncated sparse singular value decay of the sparse evaluation matrix Rf. This factoring can be interpreted as follows: Each user u has a low-dimensional embedding pu-Rf, a row in the matrix P, and each element has an embedding qi-Rf, a column of the matrix."}, {"heading": "C.

(In this section, we explain how to perform step 3, i.e. how to predict scores z for all items that use only the ratings of the evaluation process. (As shown in [11], the most accurate way to do this is to find a coefficient matrix C that allows to rate each item on scores z. (Each column of C contains the coefficients of representation of an item on the evaluations of the item sets. In short, this approximation can be written in the following way: z. \"We highlight two different approaches to calculating matrix 1) Computing coefficients over the evaluations matrix is referred to as the first one."}, {"heading": "D.

Volume of rectangular matrices This section introduces a generalization of the maximum volume concept to rectangular submatrices, which make it possible to overcome the intrinsic \"quadrilateness\" of the ordinary maximum volume concept, which is entirely based on the determinant of a square matrix. Consider S: Rf \u00b7 L0, f \u2264 L0. It is easy to see that the volume of a square matrix is equal to the product of its singular values. In the case of a rectangular matrix S, its volume [15] can be defined in a similar way: Rectvol (S): = Rectvol (S): = Rectvol = 1 \u03c3s = \u221a det (SS >).We call it rectangular volumes. The simple intuition behind this definition is that it is the volume of the ellipsoid definition, which is defined as the image of a unit sphere of the VSR."}, {"heading": "B. Algorithm", "text": "In this section, we present an algorithm for selecting L0 representative items using the term IL > IL = > IL-Q effectiveness. In the first step, the algorithm calculates the best rankf approximation of the rating matrix R, PureSVD (see section II-B for details) and selects f representative items with the pivot indices of LU decomposition from Q. Furthermore, we show that new representative items should have the maximum norm of coefficients representing their latent vector by the latent vectors of the current seed set. The procedure of such norm maximization is faster than the simple approach. At the end of this section, we describe the algorithms for an even faster update of the coefficient 1 standards."}, {"heading": "C. Compelexity analysis", "text": "The proposed algorithm consists of two general steps: the initialization (steps 1-5) and the iterative addition of columns or rows to the seed quantity (steps 6-12. The initialization step corresponds to the LU decomposition or the square Maxvol, which have O (mf2) complexity. Adding an element to the seed quantity (steps 7-11) requires the recalculation of the coefficients C (step 10) and the lengths of the coefficient vectors (step 11). Recompiling (step 10) requires a ranking-1 update of the coefficient matrix C, RL \u00b7 m and the multiplication c > i C, where ci-RL is a column of C. The complexity of each of the two operations is O (Lm), so the total complexity of an iteration (steps 7-11) is O (Lm). Since this procedure is iterated via L-f, the total complexity of each of the two operations is equal (O)."}, {"heading": "D.

Furthermore, it is important to note that the experiments in [8] used smaller versions of the datasets. Therefore, the performance of Square Maxvol on the extended datasets differs from that reported in [8]."}, {"heading": "A.

Evaluation Protocol.", "text": "Our evaluation pipeline for comparing the evaluation algorithms is similar to those introduced in [8].

However, without loss of generality, this section describes the evaluation protocol for the user cold start problem only. The element cold start problem can be evaluated in the same way after the implementation of the evaluation matrix. We evaluate the algorithms for selecting the representatives by evaluating the quality of the recommendations made after acquiring the actual evaluations of the representatives, which is in Section II-C.

Results of Experiments.", "text": "As we mentioned in Section II-C, there are two different ways to calculate the coefficients for displaying the hidden ratings from a seed set: the first approach is to calculate them using the low evaluation factors shown in Equation (7); the second approach is to calculate them using the source matrix R, as shown in Equation (4); our experiments show that the second approach shows the significantly better quality; therefore, we use this method in all our experiments. We have experiments for seed sizes from 5 to 100 with a step of 5; these compilations become possible for such a grid of parameters showing the high computational efficiency of our algorithms (see Section V); the average computory time of Rectangular Maxvol on the datasets is 1.12 seconds (Intel Xeon CPU 2.00GHz, 256Gb RAM)."}, {"heading": "V. RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Collaborative Filtering.", "text": "Conventional CF methods do not analyze domain and data-specific context of users / items [20], such as explicit user and item profiles, item text descriptions, or social relationships between users. Therefore, they are domain and data independent and can be applied to a wide range of tasks, which is their biggest advantage. As shown in [4], CF approaches based on factorization have a high accuracy in the majority of data sets. While a particular choice of factorization algorithm is not essential for our approach to the cold start problem, our methodology is based on the PureSVD, which performs better than other popular methods such as SVD + + [4]."}, {"heading": "B. Scoring Rating Elicitation Methods.", "text": "The simplest methods for selecting seed sets are to classify users or positions based on an ad hoc evaluation that shows how representative they are, taking the best-placed units as seed sets [12], [21], [22], [23]. An obvious disadvantage of such methods, which is avoided in our approach, is that these elements are taken independently of seed sets, and the variety of selected elements is limited [6]. Further, in this section we give an overview of methods that aim at selecting a diverse set of seeds and perform better. Therefore, we do not use the evaluation methods in our experiments."}, {"heading": "C. GreedyExtend.", "text": "Among them, the simplest method is the GreedyExtend approach [6]. Unfortunately, GreedyExtend's brutality method implies very high computational costs, so it is hardly scalable, unlike the approaches empirically compared in this essay, which greedily adds item i to the current seed set of indices k, NL, which maximizes the target quality measurement; the search for the best i is calculated using a brutal force method, i.e. the algorithm iteratively adds the best item to the seed set: k, k, i, where i = argmini, k F ([k, i \u2032]) and F ([k, i \u2032]) are the quality measures of the recommendations generated using the seed set indices [k, i \u2032]. The authors of this method reported the results only for an approach that uses similarities of the items to predict the ratings on the string values, which are more effectively described in the Quarterly [11] section."}, {"heading": "D. Backward Greedy Selection.", "text": "Another class of methods for searching for different representatives is based on factorizing the evaluation matrix. Since selecting user or article representatives equals selecting a submatrix of the relevant factor, these algorithms look for the submatrix that maximizes a particular criterion. Such an approach, the so-called reverse selection [11], solves only the cold-start problem of the article, but not the user's. This method is based on the techniques for transductive experimental design introduced in [24]. To obtain seed selection, it greedily removes users from a source-user selection to obtain a good seed selection that minimizes the value Trace (SS >) -1, with S-Rf-L being a submatrix in the Q-Rf-m item factor of a rank-f decomposition. Any deletion of an article requires an iterative search for all items in the data, with each Iteration costing 2L (O)."}, {"heading": "E. Representative Based Matrix Factorization.", "text": "The method presented in [8] called Representative Based Matrix Factorization (RBMF) also takes diversity into account. It uses the maximum volume concept and the Maxvol algorithm [10] to search for the most representative rows or columns in the factors of CF factorization. This approach is highly efficient and more accurate than all ad hoc competitors, but also has one important limitation: it must use the same rank of factorization as the desired number of representative users or elements for the seed set. The algorithm proposed in our paper is a generalization of Maxvol that allows the use of different rank values. It often leads to better recommendation accuracy, as shown in Section IV."}, {"heading": "F. Complexity analysis.", "text": "s get an overview of the computational complexity of the proposed rectangular Maxvol and its competitors. Some of these methods use low-value factorizations of the matrix, the detailed complexity analysis of which is contained in [13]. However, as this is not a central point of our work, we neglect the computational costs of factorizations in the further analysis, since they are the same for all evaluation algorithms and were normally calculated previously for the warm CF method. The summary of the complexity analysis is presented in Table I. The detailed complexity analysis of Square Maxvol and Rectangular Maxvol is included in sections II-D and III-C."}, {"heading": "G. Cold Start Problem", "text": "In addition to evaluation methods, various approaches to the cold start problem have been suggested in the literature.

Methods from [34], [35] analyze the performance of CF methods w.r.t. the number of known evaluations for a user."}, {"heading": "H. Maximal-Volume Concept", "text": "The concept of maximum volume, originally described in the field of marginal approximation of matrices [9], offers an approach to matrix approximation in the form of a pseudo-skeleton, which is a product of matrices formed by columns or rows of the source matrix. The algorithm known as Maxvol [10] allows to efficiently find a well-conditioned submatrix with sufficient volume to create such an approximation. Maximum volume submatrices are useful not only for low-level approximations, but also for wireless communication [36], pre-conditioning of overdetermined systems [37], tensor degradation [38] and receiver systems [8]. Our generalization of the concept of maximum volume to rectangular cases offers additional degrees of freedom, which is potentially useful in each of these areas."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In order to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, we presented the analytical and experimental comparison with the existing approaches. It seems to be an interesting direction for future work to apply the proposed framework to the construction of tree-based cold start questionnaires in recommendation systems. Another interesting direction for future work is to combine approaches from two classes: based on the maximum volume concept and based on optimal design criteria. Historically, they came from completely different fields: computational linear algebra and statistical experimental analysis. Although all these methods are very similar mathematically, it seems quite interesting to examine their similarities and differences."}, {"heading": "VII.
