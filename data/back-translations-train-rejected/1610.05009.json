The severity of ramp events can be further categorized by defining different ramp event thresholds. & wd To describe the amplitude or severity of the problem, the ramp time can be divided into a certain time span.

In the present study, we use data corresponding to an offshore site (SITE 7856) and an onshore site (SITE 13000). Wind speed and net performance are listed as characteristics over 157,969 time points in both datasets.

CONCLUSION", "text": "Gradient-enhanced regression trees are a powerful class of models for predicting learning patterns from a variety of datasets. They have been shown to be robust to overfit, easy to train, and compact to use at test date. This work shows that predicting events on wind ramps is possible from large historical datasets by paralleling the learning process of gradient-enhanced trees on multi-core machines with a large number of cores. The performance of the GBRT model is compared with the performance of modern pattern recognition and machine learning, such as support vector machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks, and Random Forests. Comparison is performed on two datasets from wind farms in Alberta, and the GBRT model shows that both datasets perform well across three metrics. In addition to the regularly used metrics of accuracy and F1 score, we have introduced an additional metric to evaluate the precedent models for these events."}, {"heading": "VII.
