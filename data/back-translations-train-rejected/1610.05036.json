Introduction", "text": "It is a powerful tool that is used for recording the neural activation observed in a wide range of cognitive tasks that are encoded in the brain. Traditional approaches deal with fMRI Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response of voxels or anatomical regions for cognitive state classification (Haxby et al., 2001; Mitchell et al., 2004). However, recent results show that connectivity between voxels or anatomical regions provides more information about brain activity than the voxel BOLD responses. Furthermore, pairwise correlations between voxel BOLD responses are proposed to represent and classify cognitive tasks. Shirer et al., 2011). Pairwise global connectivity provides better classification performance compared to traditional approaches. Brain connectivity is also reacted by a number of local meshes (Onal al al al al al al al al al al al al al, al., 2011). Pairwise global connectivity provides better classification performance compared to traditional approaches."}, {"heading": "2. Data Representation", "text": "We use fMRI data from 97 healthy subjects collected for seven cognitive tasks, namely Emotion (Emo), Gambling (Gam), Language Processing (Lan), Motor (Mot), Relational Processing (Rel), Social Processing (Soc) and Working Memory (WM). Number of scans and their duration vary for each task, but they have the same duration for all participants (see Table 1). We use R = 98 regions of automated anatomical labeling (AAL) brain atlas Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (2002) except those that cover the cerebellum. Each region is represented by ri, where i = 2,.., R. which contains a series of voxels."}, {"heading": "3. Encoding of Mesh Arc Descriptors", "text": "In this section, we present our framework for encoding MADs. First, we estimate that MADs represent the local connectivity patterns of cognitive tasks. Next, we reduce the dimension of MAD space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, we adapt GMMs to the set of MADs. Finally, we encode MADs using three methods, using their distance from the centers of GMMs: Fisher Vectors (FV), Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD), and Bag of Words (BoW). The encoded MADs are used to train an SVM classifier for cognitive task classification. Fig. 1 outlines the steps of our coding framework."}, {"heading": "3.1.

In (2), \u03bb is the regulation parameter, and yi is a vector of the average BOLD response for ri region by minimizing the variance of the error i using a ridge regression algorithm.

Fisher Vector (FV) Encoding", "text": "Considering a set of vectors, the FV method is a deviation of the distribution of vectors from a dictionary typically described by a diagonal Gaussian mixing model (GMM) (Carvajal et al., 2016). Within the proposed framework, our vectors are MADs obtained from fMRI data. We obtain a brain-connectivity dictionary of MADs by modeling the characteristics using a GMM. To fulfill the assumption of a diagonal covariance matrix of GMM and obtain early uncorrelated characteristics, we apply PCA to MADs. For simplification, we use the same notation for MADs at the output of PCA, so that ai represents the projection of a MAD in a D-dimensional space.Let A = {ai, RD} Ri = 1 denote a set of D-dimensional MADs derived from a single task of a single subject."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD)", "text": "VLAD encodes a set of descriptors into a dictionary, which is calculated by k-mean clustering method. In the proposed framework, we first perform k-mean clustering of MADs on the training data. Therefore, the cluster centroids {\u00b5} Kk = 1 correspond to our code words of the brain connectivity dictionary. Then we associate each MAD ai with its closest code word NN (ai) in the dictionary, so that NN (ai) = argminul-k-ai \u2212 \u00b5k-2, where \"2\" is the euclidean norm.

Finally, we represent each sample by a K-dimensional vector so that NA = [nA1, n A 2,..., n A k]."}, {"heading": "4. Experimental Results", "text": "We will conduct two sets of experiments: First, we will classify the cognitive tasks of HCP datasets by raw and coded MADs to see the effects of coding on MADs, and compare the performance of different coding methods.

We denounce the corresponding columns of the kth Gaussian in the FV encoding using all the training data of Gk = [GUK, GUP], then the energy is measured by the Euclidean norm GK 2."}, {"heading": "5. Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we propose a novel framework to encode the local connectivity patterns of the fMRI data for classifying the cognitive states of the fMRI task. fMRI connectivity patterns are modelled by an ensemble of local networks formed around each anatomical region. MADs are estimated by using comb regression, assuming a linear relationship between anatomical regions. fMRI connectivity patterns such as FV, VLAD and BoW are used to encode MADs. We also create a brain connectivity conditioner by matching a GMM to the set of all MADs to analyze the connectivity patterns of fMRI data in relation to anatomical regions. We observe that the FV encoding of MADs is more successful than VADD and BoW methods. In addition, FV-analyzing the coding of MADs results in an energy-dependent MADD, which also enhances the coding power of MS."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by CREST, JST and TUBITAK Project No. 114E045.
