{"id": "1610.05287", "review": {"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Oct-2016", "title": "Internet of Things Applications: Animal Monitoring with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle", "abstract": "In animal monitoring applications, both animal detection and their movement prediction are major tasks. While a variety of animal monitoring strategies exist, most of them rely on mounting devices. However, in real world, it is difficult to find these animals and install mounting devices. In this paper, we propose an animal monitoring application by utilizing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The objective of the application is to detect locations of endangered species in large-scale wildlife areas and monitor movement of animals without any attached devices. In this application, sensors deployed throughout the observation area are responsible for gathering animal information. The UAV flies above the observation area and collects the information from sensors. To achieve the information efficiently, we propose a path planning approach for the UAV based on a Markov decision process (MDP) model. The UAV receives a certain amount of reward from an area if some animals are detected at that location. We solve the MDP using Q-learning such that the UAV prefers going to those areas that animals are detected before. Meanwhile, the UAV explores other areas as well to cover the entire network and detects changes in the animal positions. We first define the mathematical model underlying the animal monitoring problem in terms of the value of information (VoI) and rewards. We propose a network model including clusters of sensor nodes and a single UAV that acts as a mobile sink and visits the clusters. Then, one MDP-based path planning approach is designed to maximize the VoI while reducing message delays. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using two real-world movement datasets of zebras and leopard. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms greedy, random heuristics and the path planning based on the traveling salesman problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Oct 2016 19:39:23 GMT  (5191kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05287v1", "12 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 20:24:58 GMT  (5179kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05287v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NI", "authors": ["jun xu", "gurkan solmaz", "rouhollah rahmatizadeh", "damla turgut", "ladislau boloni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05287"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.05287.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Internet of Things Applications: Animal Monitoring with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle", "authors": ["Jun Xu", "Rouhollah Rahmatizadeh"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index Terms - Value of Information; Markov Decision Process; Route Planning; Animal Monitoring; UAVs.

This metaphor is used in recent studies of sensor networks [7] to determine a higher value for newly acquired data. VoI of an event is highest at the moment the event occurs and the damage is most likely to be repaired."}, {"heading": "2.2 Initial rewards", "text": "We define each perceived information as an event in the target area. Each event has an initial reward = = IR, which is the value of the information at the time of the event (t = 0). In other words, IR is the maximum value of the information that can be collected for each detected event. In our application, IR is influenced by several factors: sensor credibility, distance to the animal and duration. Credibility (C) is a parameter that represents the reliability of the information collected. We define credibility based on heterogeneous sensor nodes with different capabilities and the quality of services. For example, an acoustic sensor or or node3 detects the sounds coming from one animal, while another sensor node can capture visual images. In addition, a sensor node may have a lower image quality that results in images with lower resolution than the other sensor nodes. We assume that there are k sensor nodes {N1, N2, Nk,..., Nk} which are used in the target area."}, {"heading": "3 ANIMAL MONITORING SYSTEM", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Network model", "text": "Given the large observation area in which animals live, the goal is to monitor the appearance of certain animals. First, a series of sensor nodes with monitoring capabilities are used, and a drone is introduced to collect data from the sensors used. One way to collect data from the drone is to visit each sensor directly. However, visiting each sensor node becomes impractical when the number of sensors is large, so we divide the entire area into virtual grids and select a cluster head."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Sensor nodes", "text": "Sensor nodes are used by evenly random distribution in strategic parts of the observation area. As shown in Figure 2, sensors in a grid can be treated like a cluster and a cluster head is selected periodically. Sensors within a virtual grid can communicate directly or via hop-by-hop communication with the cluster head. Cluster head is responsible for receiving event messages from other sensors and then sending all event messages to the drone when it comes. Routing and clustering are not part of this paper, but they are well-studied problems and there are various efficient mechanisms [8] [9]. For example, Hamidreza et4 al. [8] suggest a method of selecting cluster heads (rendezvous points) by considering node degree and hop distance together to minimize energy consumption and improve load balance."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 UAV", "text": "In this WSN application, the drone is used as an autonomous mobile sink to collect time-sensitive information. Apart from the benefits mentioned above, the use of the drone to monitor animals not only overcomes the geographical challenge, but also does not affect animals. Assumptions of the network model are given as follows: - There is a single drone as it is the expensive element of the network. - The drone has no energy restrictions, while this is not the case with the sensor nodes. - The drone flies at a fixed speed and communicates only with cluster heads."}, {"heading": "3.2 Markov decision-based path planning", "text": "This means that they are more likely to stay in a particular place for rest or have only activities in a small area. Fig. 3 shows real movement paths of 2 zebras in 3 days. As it can be shown in this figure, the zebra's mobility decisions in a region are not random. Instead, they prefer to stay in one place or simply move around nearby. Furthermore, we observe that a zebra can visit a place that has already been visited several times. Therefore, the perception of a zebra in a region may infer the possibility of future visits to the same region. Based on this observation, we use a Markov decision model (MDP) for the planning problem of UAV. A finite state MDP is a 6-tuple (S, P, R, R, R, s0, s1,..., sm is a series of actions and P is a series of state transition opportunities."}, {"heading": "4 SIMULATION STUDY", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Simulation environment", "text": "The proposed WSN application and the UAV path planning approach are tested with simulation experiments.

The first is the ZebraNet [4] dataset, which was used in our previous work [1]. This dataset contains the location information of 5 zebras in June 2005 at a location near Nanyuki, Kenya. However, the scan time of the GPS tracks is 10 minutes and the total experiment time is 14 days. The second dataset is a leopard turtle, which contains the motion tracks of 10 leopard turtles in the Kalahari Desert. It includes the tracks recorded for three months from January to March 2013. The scan time of the GPS tracks is 60 minutes. The difference between these two datasets is that animals in ZebraNet roam in a wider area. They move most of the time, for example examples of their motion tracks are shown in the figure. 3. The animals in the Leopard Turtle dataset are Uaset sets in a small range of data sets as a rule."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Event and reward", "text": "We define some interesting events in the experiments carried out. The purpose of the application is to detect and predict the appearance of animals. If an animal first appears in an area, the sensor nodes can record it. However, if the same animal stays in this small area for a very long time, as in the case when the animal sleeps there, this is worthless for our application and can lead to an excessive energy consumption of the sensor nodes. Therefore, we define the events as the following time span. - If an animal moves from one grid to another, we count it as an event. - If an animal always stays in a grid, instead of recording it at each sampling interval, we record its location regularly once in any amount of time.In Section 3, Equation 11 specifies the reward details when the UAV enters a grid. We discussed the initial reward (IR) in Section 2. Each event has an initial reward related to the type of animal dose, the genetic information we determine for the duration of the duration of the Cdidichs, the Cdidi-Isuchs, and the duration we only for the duration."}, {"heading": "4.1.3 Metrics", "text": "In order to quantify the performance of a route planning strategy, we report the results according to three performance indicators in our simulation study.- Value of information (VoI).VoI is the most important metric in this animal observation application and maximizes it as the primary goal in designing the proposed MDP path planning approach. The definition of VoI is given in Section 2 and the parameter values used in the experiment are shown in Table 1. - Time Delay. Since event messages must be kept in sensors until they are sent to the UAV, message delay is an important metric. Long message delays render event messages useless and their information content worthless. In this experiment, we measure both the average message delay and the message delay for all events. - As the UAV flies throughout the network, we define a radius within which the zebras can be observed directly by the UAV."}, {"heading": "4.2 Simulation results", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to leave the country in which it is able to leave it, and it is able to leave the country."}, {"heading": "5 RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Tracking animals with sensor networks", "text": "Their main objective is to track specific animals in a monitored area and to report their location and other information to users. [12] Many animal tracking technologies have been proposed and implemented by engineers and naturalists [4]. An important technology is portable GPS-based animal tracking. Juang et al. [4] present their ZebraNetproject, which builds a fast wireless system for tracking zebras. Location nodes are installed on zebras and the GPS positions of zebras are periodically recorded. In their research, they investigate system concepts, communication protocols between tracking nodes, and how sensor specifications such as battery life and weight limit system performance. In addition, some recent research [16] on animal behavior through the installation of portable GPS devices. Although remote sensing can be used to collect various types of data from a large area."}, {"heading": "5.2 Path planning for mobile sinks in WSNs", "text": "They can be programmed to perform application-specific tasks in different areas of the WSN. The common goal of route planning for mobile sinks is to maximize the information collected and minimize travel time. In such applications, mobile sinks can either directly visit each sensor node or only visit a subset of them. Hollinger et al. [27] Route planning for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to collect data from an underground sensor network must be as much as possible to take into account fuel costs."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "Motivated by the movement characteristics of the animals, we propose a Markov decision-making approach for the route planning of the drone. Decision-making is dynamically based on knowledge of the animals \"appearance; the drone predicts active areas of the animals and visits these predicted areas in order to maximize the overall value of information from the entire network; the proposed network model is evaluated based on real-world mobility traces of zebras and leopard tortoises; simulation results show that the performance of the proposed route planning approach is better than random, greedy and TSP-based approaches in terms of VoI, message lag and number of animals directly observed; in addition to animal tracking, the proposed model is also effective in this research for other scenarios, such as tracking objects that regularly reside in specific areas and monitoring some dynamically changing subareas in a large network. The drone in our model can find these dynamic hot areas by exploring and learning the monitored area."}], "references": [{"title": "Animal monitoring with unmanned aerial vehicle-aided wireless sensor networks", "author": ["J.

"year": 2017, "abstractText": "In animal monitoring applications, both animal detection and their movement prediction are major tasks. While a variety of animal monitoring strategies exist, most of them rely on mounting devices. However, in real world, it is difficult to find these animals and install mounting devices. In this paper, we propose an animal monitoring application by utilizing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The objective of the application is to detect locations of endangered species in large-scale wildlife areas and monitor movement of animals without any attached devices. In this application, sensors deployed throughout the observation area are responsible for gathering animal information. The UAV flies above the observation area and collects the information from sensors. To achieve the information efficiently, we propose a path planning approach for the UAV based on a Markov decision process (MDP) model. The UAV receives a certain amount of reward from an area if some animals are detected at that location. We solve the MDP using Q-learning such that the UAV prefers going to those areas that animals are detected before. Meanwhile, the UAV explores other areas as well to cover the entire network and detects changes in the animal positions. We first define the mathematical model underlying the animal monitoring problem in terms of the value of information (VoI) and rewards. We propose a network model including clusters of sensor nodes and a single UAV that acts as a mobile sink and visits the clusters. Then, one MDP-based path planning approach is designed to maximize the VoI while reducing message delays. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using two real-world movement datasets of zebras and leopard. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms greedy and random heuristics as well as the path planning based on the solution of the traveling salesman problem.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
