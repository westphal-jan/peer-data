In computer science in particular, benchmarks play a central role, e.g. in image processing [15, 29, 22], hardware performance [7], and optimization [32, 28, 5].In the context of optimization, David S. Johnson [24] looks at the analysis of algorithms in three approaches: the worst-case, average case, and experimental analysis. Relative to experimental papers, he identifies four situations: (i) to solve a real problem; (ii) to provide evidence that one algorithm is superior to the others; (iii) to better understand a problem; and (iv) to examine the average case. He suggests the use of well-established benchmarks to provide evidence of the superiority of an algorithm (item ii). Such papers are called reproducibility aspects in general papers, and Johnson emphasizes that."}, {"heading": "2 Notation and Definition", "text": "Consider a weighted (directed or undirected) graph G (V, E) in which a depot is a special depot.

We use w (u, v) to represent w (u, v), but it is possible to define variants of VRP where k variable.Let w (u, v, G) be the shortest way cost between vertices u and v in graph G. We use w (u, v) when G is known within the context. We represent a solution as a sequence of wells. LetS (C, k) = (c1)."}, {"heading": "3 Methodology", "text": "The instances were not generated from the actual application data of the post office. Nevertheless, the first author applied his domain expertise (he worked for four years in a post office in Arthur Nogueira) to make the instances as realistic as possible. Starting point was the map of the city Arthur Nogueira, as shown in Fig. 4. Line segments representing the streets were drawn at the top of the map (Fig. 5). Each corner was automatically identified using an algorithm calculating intersections. The result was a weighted chart in which the weight of one edge represents the length of the segment. Clearly, the edges representing deliveries that must be made by one vehicle to follow the direction of a one-way street. In our case, however, postmen deliveries were made by foot. We created the graph directly from the road map because: (i) the path length by foot of one map may differ from the other, the maps by the number of roads that are prioritized by the number of vehicles in Areira."}, {"heading": "3.1 Streets Density of Probabilty", "text": "For each road we classify as roads, we have 25% more than ever before. There are construction attributes region (R), type (T) and zone (Z). Both road attributes and penalties were created on the basis of expert knowledge. The criterion by region follows the premise that the closest roads have a higher rate of deliveries by unit length than the roads in extreme regions of the city. We define a multiplicative penalty for each type of region.We also define the attribute type with four levels: Type Avenue Alameda (Penal) 1.0 0.4 0.2It means that the paving of other roads, an isolated road has 80% less deliveries than a central road per unit of longevity. We define the attribute type Avenue Alameda Highway Multiplic. We (Penal) 1.0 0.75 0.4 0.0In this work, we get all motorways directly the value 0 because there are no roads."}, {"heading": "3.2 Generating the Delivery Points", "text": "We define a variable weight w asw (Street) = D (Street) Length (Street).So w is directly proportional to the relative probability density and to the road length.E [ne (Street)] = w (Street) k, Let's take a weight sequence (w1, w2,.., wn) associated with the streets (Street1, Street2,..., Streetn).So we define a variable W asW = n \u2211 i = 1w (Streeti) The algorithm takes into account all weights projected in a range [0, W]. For each delivery point, a random value R = [0, W] is created. If this random value falls on the area of a particular street, the delivery point is distributed into the respective street.In a street, the ne (Street) delivery points are evenly distributed."}, {"heading": "4 Using VRPBench to Model Manhatan Streets", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5 Result", "text": "We created 10 sets of instances with 10 instances for set, resulting in 100 instances. The number of delivery points of each set is 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000 and 10000, respectively the distribution of 1000 delivery points for a randomly selected area of the city: Input: A sequence of weights (w1, w2,..., wn): Rn for streets and the total number of delivery points m \u00b2 N.

A solution that reduces the distance also reduces the delivery effort and can also be understood as a gain. Furthermore, from a scientific point of view, this is the first benchmark for the VRP with 10,000 delivery points.Future perspectives From this work, we want to publish an essay. We intend to develop a free software system to validate and classify the solutions found by the researchers and also provide a view of the routes. Lower limits have a more complex validation and will not be released until they are associated with a publication.Finally, I would like to work on the development of an algorithm to solve the cases presented in this thesis in a future master's degree program."}], "references": [{"title": "A pso approach for solving vrptw with real case study", "author": ["Shahrzad Amini", "Hassan Javanshir", "Reza Tavakkoli-Moghaddam"], "venue": "Int.

"year": 2016, "abstractText": "The number of optimization techniques in the combinatorial domain is large and diversified. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of real benchmarks to validate optimization algorithms. In this work we introduce VRPBench, a tool to create instances and visualize solutions to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) in a planar graph embedded in the Euclidean 2D space. We use VRPBench to model a real-world mail delivery case of the city of Artur Nogueira. Such scenarios were characterized as a multi-objective optimization of the VRP. We extracted a weighted graph from a digital map of the city to create a challenging benchmark for the VRP. Each instance models one generic day of mail delivery with hundreds to thousands of delivery points, thus allowing both the comparison and validation of optimization algorithms for routing problems.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
