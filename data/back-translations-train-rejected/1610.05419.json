These schemes render a sparse user's position vector, and in parallel, minimize the distance between the online measurement and radio map. The overall localization scheme for both methods consists of three steps: 1) coarse localization, obtained from comparing the online measurements with clustered radio map. A novel graph-based method is proposed to cluster the offline fingerprints. In the online phase, a Region Of Interest (ROI) is selected within which we search for the user's location; 2) Access Point (AP) selection; and 3) fine localization through the novel sparse recovery algorithms. Since the online measurements are subject to inordinate measurement readings, called outliers, the sparse recovery methods are modified in order to jointly estimate the outliers and user's position vector. The outlier detection procedure identifies the APs whose readings are either not available or erroneous. The proposed localization methods have been tested with Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements in a typical office environment and the results show that they can localize the user with significantly high accuracy and resolution which is superior to the results from competing WLAN fingerprinting localization methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 03:37:11 GMT  (7407kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05419v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["ali khalajmehrabadi", "nikolaos gatsis", "daniel pack", "david akopian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05419"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.05419.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Joint Indoor WLAN Localization and Outlier Detection Scheme Using LASSO and Elastic-Net Optimization Techniques", "authors": ["Ali Khalajmehrabadi", "Nikolaos Gatsis", "David Akopian"], "emails": ["ali.khalajmehrabadi@utsa.edu,", "nikolaos.gatsis@utsa.edu,"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index terms - indoor location, Wi-Fi fingerprint, sparse recovery, outlier detectionF"}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "In the last two decades, there has been no established indoor infrastructure, although some approaches use indoor GPS coverage, which prevents complicated indoor structures from making these approaches a success.

Ideally, it is assumed that the user is present at exactly one of the RPs. Then, the localization problem can be interpreted as assigning one of the RPs in the area as the location of the user. This localization problem is of a sparse nature and therefore, the position estimation problem can be formulated in such a way that an indicator position vector is found whose only element is non-zero (1-sparse vector). Thus, the localization problem can be formulated as a \"1 minimization problem,\" known as CS.Introduce, a sparse position indicator vector = [0,.., 0, 1, 0,..

Since the size of y is smaller than \u03b8, the CS problem is an underdetermined problem. However, \u03b8 is sparse, since the user can only be at one of the RP sites and the problem can be solved via the convex optimization line. This optimization formulation assumes that the model (2) does not contain a measurement error. Several algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem, e.g. greedy algorithms [70], [71], iterative reweighted linear lease quares (IRLS) problems."}, {"heading": "3 NOVEL LOCALIZATION APPROACH BASED ON SPARSE RECOVERY", "text": "The general framework of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 1. We work out this framework in the order in which it appears in the diagram."}, {"heading": "3.1 Offline Clustering", "text": "The localization approach should be applicable to handheld devices with low computing capacity. As the computational complexity of minimization problems increases polynomially with the size of the problem, searching for the location of the mobile user across the RP group is impractical. Therefore, the localization approach should be limited to a subset of RPs and online measurement is compared with the representative characteristics of each sub-cluster. Clustering should be done in the offline phase so that the localization scheme is compared to a categorized radio map. As we plot the radio map in four orientations, the offline map is applied to each orientation. In our offline RP cluster approach, we consider each RP as a node of a graph."}, {"heading": "3.2 Online Region of Interest (ROI) Selection", "text": "Since the solution of the optimization algorithms is the most computationally intensive part, the size of the problem should also be reduced. Therefore, we find an ROI as the most likely region on which the user exists. ROI selection is based on a comparison between the reliability vectors of the online measurements and the radio map. After the user has read the online measurement y, an indicator vector Iy = {I1y,..., I L y} is specifically defined to denote the set of reliable APs. An AP is considered reliable if its online RSS values are above a predetermined threshold. Iiy = {1, if the indicator vector 0 or.w. (16) This reliability vector defines the most reliable APs in online measurements that we can include in calculations. Similarly, we have defined the AP reliability matrix for the radio map in Section 3.1."}, {"heading": "3.3 AP Selection", "text": "In principle, localization in a two-dimensional space requires three anchors on which the ambiguities that are available are based."}, {"heading": "3.4 Localization Scheme", "text": "The typical problem in wireless positioning is the estimation of the position of the user using fingerprinting data on a discrete grid of the RPs when the user reads an RSS observation in the online phase.

(However, this is not the case), although the actual efficiency of sparsity-based approaches, indoor WLAN-based positioning systems and systems can be significantly impaired. (This is why the APs adapt their transmission capacities to the traffic flow.) If the traffic load during online positioning is different from that of fingerprinting, the APs measurements may have other problems, as the APs infrastructure is essentially vulnerable to positioning purposes. (Our real-world measurements also indicate that the APs measurements are available in both APs due to transient effects.)"}, {"heading": "5 IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "This section deals with the experimental evaluation of the proposed methods in a real environment.

That's why we set the device to record the RSSI readings once per second and store the MAC address and RSS in a database."}, {"heading": "5.2 Environment Setup", "text": "Real data was obtained from the third floor of the five-story Applied Engineering and Technology (AET) building at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). The measurement site dimensions are 300 ft x 35 ft, comparable to those reported in [36], [40]. The layout of the experimental area is illustrated in Fig. 2 and the green circles show the locations of the fingerprints. The area is representative of an indoor office environment with a complex wireless distribution pattern based on research laboratories, offices, libraries and study areas, and has a high commute rate. For fingerprints, the RP sites can be drawn from a point process in which the position of the RPs is derived from a probability distribution. This method leads to points along the busiest routes. Another approach is to look at a predefined grid of RPs."}, {"heading": "5.3 Training and Testing Data Collection", "text": "During the offline phase, the area was divided into a total of 192 grid points and we collected 100 samples per grid point at four device orientations over a three-week period. Fingerprint time was chosen during office hours to capture the most non-linear RSS features when there was a high commute in the area. In total, 268 different MAC addresses were visible, although the number of APs is not exactly known. Therefore, we assume that each MAC address is associated with an AP. The test measurements were taken on and off grid points.In the survey area, a collection of Nt = 100 random points is selected and only a single RSS measurement is read at each point. Finally, the tuning parameters for (13), (6) and (16) are listed in Table 1."}, {"heading": "5.4 Localization Error", "text": "The performance of the proposed methods is measured by calculating the average Euclidean distance between the estimated and the true locations of the random points, known as Mean Average Error (MAE) MAE = 1Nt Nt \u2211 j = 1 \u221a (p) \u2212 p (j))) T (p (j) \u2212 p (j)) (29), where p (j) and p (j) are the true and estimated places respectively. Localization error of a locating system is strongly influenced by RSS variations, the number of APs and the subset of RPs and APs selected in the localization system. To alleviate the time-varying RSS fingerprints, the recorded offline readings have been averaged over time, as explained in Section 2. Online measurement is recorded once. The assumption of taking multiple online measurements is unrealistic in existing localization methods unless the user stays at that location during the online acquisition."}, {"heading": "5.5 Offline Clustering", "text": "The performance of the sparse recovery localization approaches strongly depends on the number of online measurements (APs) and the number of predictors (RPs). In CS-based localization, the number of measurements should be in the order of the Log-N value to ensure a clear recovery of the position vector. However, if the measurements of the radio map are correlated, the required number of measurements should be significantly increased and therefore more APs should be used for a good, sparse recovery. This problem is alleviated in LASSO and GLMNET localization, as each has its own recovery scheme for correlated predictors. Clustering brings a twofold benefit to localization. Since the solution should be found on the number of predictors (RPs), clustering helps to reduce the number of RPs, the columns of errors of the LPs, and thus the number of APs needed for good recovery, which also reduces the size of the LAPs."}, {"heading": "5.6 Online Localization and Comparison to Prior Work", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have shown that a simple cluster algorithm can efficiently cluster the RPs when the cluster scheme includes overlapping clusters connected by neighboring clusters. In addition, the two proposed localization approaches, LASSO and GLMNET, are able to deliver significantly lower localization errors because they also minimize residuals between the radio map and online measurement. Furthermore, they are not negatively affected by the correlated fingerprints of the radio map, but benefit from the similarity of the RSS readings and do not require orthogonalization pre-processing. We have also shown that if the APs contain outliers, as is likely, the positioning error would be high. Therefore, by augmenting the proposed method together, our methods can detect, modify the outlier and estimate the position of the user."}, {"heading": "7 FUTURE WORK", "text": "The comparison of many different localization techniques is hampered by the lack of standardized representative data that can be used for fair comparisons.The authors plan an open data repository of their data that can be used by the community for comparative studies.The radio map addressed in this thesis has four orientations.The proposed localization scheme integrates the available information from all the orientations described, but there may be alternative formulations for dealing with different orientations, which is of great interest for further studies.In addition, the experimental results in the previous section showed that the fine localization algorithms represent fluctuations in localization accuracy for a small number of APs. An interest of our future research is to find the causes of this phenomenon and provide more stable localization mechanisms with a smaller number of APs."}, {"heading": "8 ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments, which have improved the quality of this work."}], "references": [{"title": "Data fusion of power and time measurements for mobile terminal location", "author": ["M.

The overall localization scheme for both methods consists of three steps: 1) coarse localization, obtained from comparing the online measurements with clustered radio map. A novel graph-based method is proposed to cluster the offline fingerprints. In the online phase, a Region Of Interest (ROI) is selected within which we search for the user\u2019s location; 2) Access Point (AP) selection; and 3) fine localization through the novel sparse recovery algorithms. Since the online measurements are subject to inordinate measurement readings, called outliers, the sparse recovery methods are modified in order to jointly estimate the outliers and user\u2019s position vector. The outlier detection procedure identifies the APs whose readings are either not available or erroneous. The proposed localization methods have been tested with Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements in a typical office environment and the results show that they can localize the user with significantly high accuracy and resolution which is superior to the results from competing WLAN fingerprinting localization methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
