The localization method consists of a novel multicomponent optimization technique that minimizes the squared $\\ell_{2}$-norm of the residuals between the radio map and the online Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements, the $\\ell_{1}$-norm of the user's location vector, and weighted $\\ell_{2}$-norms of layered groups of Reference Points (RPs). RPs are grouped using a new criterion based on the similarity between the so-called Access Point (AP) coverage vectors. In addition, since AP readings are prone to containing inordinate readings, called outliers, an augmented optimization problem is proposed to detect the outliers and localize the user with cleaned online measurements. Moreover, a novel scheme to record fingerprints from a smaller number of RPs and estimate the radio map at RPs without recorded fingerprints is developed using sparse recovery techniques. All localization schemes are tested on RSS fingerprints collected from a real environment. The overall scheme has comparable complexity with competing approaches, while it performs with high accuracy under a small number of APs and finer granularity of RPs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 03:45:00 GMT  (1212kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05421v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["ali khalajmehrabadi", "nikolaos gatsis", "david akopian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05421"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.05421.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Structured Group Sparsity: A Novel Indoor WLAN Localization, Outlier Detection, and Radio Map Interpolation Scheme", "authors": ["Ali Khalajmehrabadi"], "emails": ["ali.khalajmehrabadi@utsa.edu,", "nikolaos.gatsis@utsa.edu,", "david.akopian@utsa.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "II.

Related Work", "text": "The state-of-the-art localization approaches are divided into three broad categories, based mainly on their fine localization methods: 1) probabilistic approaches that determine the user's location based on statistical methods such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) [18], Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [31], KL divergence [32], Dynamic Hybrid Projection (DHP) [29]; 2) pattern recognition schemes such as Support-Vector Machines (SVM) [37], [38]; and 3) deterministic methods based on distance measurement between online measurements and radio map finger printing.

Challenges in Indoor WLAN Fingerprinting Localization: Outliers and Radio Map Construction", "text": "Although CS-based localization is one of the most prominent fingerprint systems, it still suffers from several drawbacks: the CS-based method requires that the radio card matrix fulfills certain characteristics to provide a clear solution. [43] Therefore, the radio card matrix must have orthogonal pre-processing that may not work well because the radio card matrix is a bold matrix. Orthogonization is also an additional step that increases computational complexity. Also, the CS approach assumes that the RSS measurements find a position vector that matches the fingerprints accurately."}, {"heading": "III.

Group Sparsity-Based Localization", "text": "The main idea of the proposed localization scheme is to efficiently combine rough and fine localization in a single step. Thus, localization is accomplished by solving an optimization problem that combines the following objectives: \u2022 Minimizing the square '2 norm of residuals between the radio map and online measurements. \u2022 Restoring a sparse user position vector by minimizing the' 1 norm of the total user position vector. \u2022 Participating all RPs in the location estimation by taking into account the RP groups and their respective weights found in the first step (layered clustering). This is the group parity component and is expressed as the summation of the \"2 standards of the groups of the RPs.\" This component shrinks the non-zero elements of the position vectors into a single group."}, {"heading": "C. Online Layered Clustering", "text": "In this subsection, we propose a new method for defining the groups of RPs and their respective weights, which is summarized in algorithm 1 and is described in detail next. First, we define the AP coverage vector for the radio map as Ij = [I1j,.], I L j], where Iij = 1 if AP i has continuous coverage at pj and is 0 otherwise. An AP provides continuous coverage at pj if its fingerprints are above a threshold for 90 percent of time samples [18]. Likewise, for the online vector y, the coverage vector Iy is set to H if the online coverage of AP i is higher, and zero otherwise. The hamming distance between two binary vectors Iy and Ij is used to indicate the number of APs with different coverage (lines 1-3 of algorithm 1) (IdH, Ij)."}, {"heading": "D. AP Selection", "text": "Because WLANs are designed to provide maximum network coverage over the entire area, the number of available APs in an area is much larger than the number required for positioning. In addition, not all APs are suitable for positioning as high-variance APs, leading to distorted estimates. This motivates us to include a number of APs in the localization that can efficiently represent the characteristics of the environment.In our work, we have considered two AP selection methods: \u2022 Strongest APs Selection: In this method, we look at the set of APs whose online measurements exceed a predefined threshold. The intuition behind this idea is that the strongest APs can provide the best characteristics of the area."}, {"heading": "VI. OUTLIER DETECTION", "text": "In this section, the problem of localization with the presence of outliers is addressed, as outliers cannot be detected by AP selection methods, as they mainly focus on selecting outliers for the best differentiation between RPs. If AP measurements contain outliers, the punishment of \"1 standard of location vector\" alone does not guarantee outlier rejection and positioning, which suffer dramatically from large localization errors. According to the discussion above, outliers can be integrated into our previous parity-based localization model (3) asy = vector + (15), which is a vector indicating the outliers and where positioning suffers dramatically from large localization errors."}, {"heading": "VII.

This package gives the freedom to set the reading interval of the network card (NIC) of the device to the desired values. To our knowledge, the device has a delay in updating the NIC card, and therefore the sampling intervals cannot be set to small values. We set the application to read the NIC once a second to get the updated RSS values. The device also records the Media Access Control (MAC) address of each AP along with its RSS size."}, {"heading": "B. Fingerprinting Setup", "text": "The fingerprints were collected on the second floor of the Applied Engineering Technology (AET) building with an area of 576 ft x 35 ft, and on the second floor of the Biotechnology Sciences and Engineering (BSE) building with an area of 114 ft x 347 ft, both at the University of Texas in San Antonio, comparable to those reported in [18], [22]. Fig. 4 shows the map of the second floor of the AET, where the green dots represent the fingerprint locations. It has a representative office environment indoors with complex wireless dispersion patterns due to research laboratories, offices, a library and study areas, and has a high pendulum volume. The BSE floor is structurally different from that of the AET, as it contains laboratories, offices, conference rooms, a wide open hall and a cafeteria.The WiFi signals are unable to distinguish precisely between the dots, resulting in a dense granularity resulting in unnecessary and redundancy."}, {"heading": "C. Evaluation Metrics", "text": "The indicator for the evaluation of method accuracy is the average of the euclidean distance between the estimated and the actual location, known as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) [18], [21], [22], [27] MAE = 1Nt Nt \u2211 n = 1 \u221a (p \u207b (n) \u2212 p (n))) T (p (n) \u2212 p (n)) (23), where Nt is the number of test points. Other indicators of the performance of a localization system are the minimum and maximum errors as well as the error frequency. A suitable measure that includes these features is the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of errors."}, {"heading": "D. Experimental Results of GS-based Localization Approach", "text": "The localization performance depends on the AP selection scheme. Fig. 3 shows the average localization errors among the two different AP selection methods, namely the strongest AP selection and the Fisher criterion if the range was divided into K = 15 groups. The horizontal axis shows the number of APs used for localization. AP selection based on the Fisher criterion definitely has better performance. For the rest of the results, the Fisher criterion was chosen as the AP selection mechanism. Fig. 4 shows the MAE of the CS-based localization for an increasing number of APs. When implementing the CS-based localization, the entire radio map was used without using a rough localization."}, {"heading": "E. Experimental Results of MGS-based Localization Approach", "text": "Figure 8 shows the MAE of MGS-based and CS-based localization methods for an increasing rate of outliers in the APs.

The cumulative distribution error for MGS-based and CS-based localization schemes. The CS-based localization errors excessively show the sensitivity of the approach to system malfunction. The MGS-based localization shows a large low distribution of errors. The localization is sensitive to outliers, even if a small number of APs are corrupted. Normally, the percentage of APs indicates that the localization is based on outliers."}, {"heading": "F. Tuning Parameters", "text": "There are several ways to adjust the parameters \u03bb1, \u03bb2 for the GS-based localization and \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3 for the MGS-based localization schemes. One approach is the well-known cross-validation (CV) [64]. The CV finds the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the residuals for a range of \u03bbi, i = 1, 2, 3 and selects the one with the lowest MSE. Another approach is to use training data and find the best values that minimize the localization error. The latter method used in this paper is a simple and effective method for selecting these parameters. Only 10 training samples were used for the coordination. Fig. 10 shows the localization error for an increasing 1 / 2 when 12 APs were used. The best parameter values must be calibrated for each building (e.g. in the fingerprint phase)."}, {"heading": "G. Experimental Results of LASSO-based Interpolation Scheme", "text": "In addition, the LASSO-based approach of Section VII is applied in the offline phase to reduce the number of fingerprints. For radio card interpolation, we chose 96, 64, 48 and 38 randomly selected RPs, resulting in 12, 1 3, 1 4 and 1 5 of the total of 192 RPs. The average radio card recovery error, which is the absolute difference between the actual and the reconstructed radio card, is called the Reconstruction Error (RE).The reconstruction error when 1 / 2 of the RPs is used for localization is 1.02 dB, which can be compared with the error in [22]."}, {"heading": "IX.

"abstractText": "This paper introduces novel schemes for indoor localization, outlier detection, and radio map interpolation using Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The localization method consists of a novel multicomponent optimization technique that minimizes the squared `2-norm of the residuals between the radio map and the online Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements, the `1-norm of the user\u2019s location vector, and weighted `2-norms of layered groups of Reference Points (RPs). RPs are grouped using a new criterion based on the similarity between the so-called Access Point (AP) coverage vectors. In addition, since AP readings are prone to containing inordinate readings, called outliers, an augmented optimization problem is proposed to detect the outliers and localize the user with cleaned online measurements. Moreover, a novel scheme to record fingerprints from a smaller number of RPs and estimate the radio map at RPs without recorded fingerprints is developed using sparse recovery techniques. All localization schemes are tested on RSS fingerprints collected from a real environment. The overall scheme has comparable complexity with competing approaches, while it performs with high accuracy under a small number of APs and finer granularity of RPs.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
