We focus on one particular personal trait, gender, and study how it is manifested in original texts and in translations. We show that gender has a powerful, clear signal in originals, but this signal is obfuscated in human and machine translation. We then propose simple domain-adaptation techniques that help retain the original gender traits in the translation outcome, without harming the quality of the translation, thereby creating more personalized machine translation systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 07:39:40 GMT  (146kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05461v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 12 Jan 2017 11:43:05 GMT  (137kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05461v2", "EACL 2017, 11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ella rabinovich", "shachar mirkin", "raj nath patel", "lucia specia", "shuly wintner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05461"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.05461.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Personalized Machine Translation: Preserving Original Author Traits", "authors": ["Ella Rabinovich", "Shachar Mirkin", "Raj Nath Patel", "Lucia Specia", "Shuly Wintner"], "emails": ["ellarabi@gmail.com", "shacharm@il.ibm.com", "patelrajnath@gmail.com", "l.specia@sheffield.ac.uk", "shuly@cs.haifa.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Among the many factors that shape the make-up of a text, gender plays a major role in our perception of the content.

Specifically, we are using the extension of its parallel versions en-fr and en-de (Rabinovich et al., 2015), in which each sentence pair is commented on with the name of the speaker, the original language in which the sentence was pronounced, and the date of the corresponding minutes of the meeting. In order to add demographic characteristics to the speaker information, we have used the MEP information page 2 of the Europarl website and used a procedure of gender and age identification, as further in \u00a7 3.1. The final resource includes en-fr and en-de parallel bilingual corpora, in which metadata from mem-1 are available at http: / / cl.haifa.ac.il / projects / pmt 2http: / / www.europarl.europa.eu / en / bers of the European Parliament (MEP), the age at which the MEP session is available."}, {"heading": "3.1 Identification of MEP gender", "text": "The gender comments were conducted using three different resources: Wikidata, Genderize and AlchemyVision, which we briefly describe below. Wikidata (Vrandec ic \"and Kro tzsch, 2014) is a man-curated knowledge repository of structured data from Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. Wikidata provides an API3 that provides details of people in the repository, including place and date of birth, profession and gender. For the MEPs we found in Wikidata, we first confirmed that the person holds (or held) a position as a Member of the European Parliament and, if so, the gender can be retrieved. Wikidata information is not complete: not all names, positions or gender data are included. Overall, we received gender information for 2,618 MEPs (73% of the total of 3,586), of whom 1,882 (72%) and 736 women (28%)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Resource evaluation and statistics", "text": "Although Wikidata was created manually to verify its accuracy, we manually commented on the gender of 100 randomly selected MEPs with available Wikidata gender information; we found the metadata perfectly accurate. We therefore rely on Wikidata as the gold standard by which we can judge the accuracy of the other two resources. Table 2 presents the accuracy and reach of each resource based on this methodology. Given the information obtained from the three resources, we assign each MEP a single gender prediction: whenever it is found in Wikidata (2, 618 MEPs), the gender is determined by that resource. Otherwise, when both Genetic Genetics and AlchemyVision produce agreed gender information (336 out of 338 cases), we determine the gender according to that prediction; the same applies to the case where only one Genetic Genetic Genetic or AlchemyVision provided a prediction (346% and 178%, respectively)."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental setup", "text": "We assess the extent to which gender characteristics are retained in the translation by evaluating the accuracy of the gender classification of original and translated texts. The basic idea is that the more prominent gender characteristics are in the text, the easier it is to classify the gender of the author."}, {"heading": "4.1 Translationese vs. gender traits", "text": "Using the accuracy of gender identification as a benchmark, we isolate the dimension of gender in our data: The classification experiments are performed separately on original, man-translated texts and on each of the MT products. Human and, in particular, machine translations represent different and distinct language variants, distinguished by unique distributions of characteristics (\u00a7 2). We assume that, for both human and machine translation products, the differences between original texts and translations overshadow the differences in gender. We confirm this assumption by analyzing a sample data distribution in two dimensions: (i) translation status and (ii) gender. Figure 1 shows the results for the English Europarl corpus. Both charts show data distributions of the same four classes: original (O) and translated (T) English7 by male (M) and female (F) language components (OM, TM) to ensure that the translation component is separated from the gender component (TF)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Datasets", "text": "In addition to the Europarl corpus, which is separated by gender (\u00a7 3), we experimented with a Corpus of7This experiment refers to the English translated from French; other language pairs showed similar trends. TED conversations (transcripts and translations): a collection of texts from a completely different genre in which demographic characteristics can manifest themselves differently. (2015) This corpus contains the comment of gender contained in these two very different sets of data to examine the robustness of our approach. We used the TED gender data from Mirkin et al. (2015) This corpus contains the comment of the speaker, which is included in the English-French corpus of the IWSLT 2014.

For classification, we used Platt's minimum sequential optimization algorithm (Keerthi et al., 2001) to train vector machine classifiers with the default linear kernel (Hall et al., 2009). In all experiments, we used (the maximum) equal amount of data from each category (M and F), especially 370 chunks for each gender.

We trained 5 gram Kneser-Ney smoothing language models (Chen and Goodman, 1996), which were tuned with Minimum Error Rate Tuning (MERT) (Och., 2003). Our pre-processing included cleaning (removal of empty, long and misaligned sentences), tokenization, and punctuation normalization. Stanford's tokenizer (Manning et al., 2014) was used for tokenization, and standard Moses scripts were used for other pre-processing tasks. We used BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) to evaluate MT quality using a reference translation."}, {"heading": "5 Personalized SMT models", "text": "We show that these models, despite their simplicity, result in a better preservation of gender characteristics without compromising the overall quality of translations.9http: / / nlp.stanford.edu / software / tagger.shtml 10We used the lists of available function words athttps: / / code.google.com / archive / p / stop-words.We treat the task of personalizing SMT models as a domain customization task where the domain is the gender.
