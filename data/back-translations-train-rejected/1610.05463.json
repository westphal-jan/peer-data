In this paper, we close a loop between ML and visualization via interaction between ML algorithm and users, so machine intelligence and human intelligence can cooperate and improve each other in a mutually rewarding way. In particular, we propose \"transparent boosting tree (TBT)\", which visualizes both the model structure and prediction statistics of each step in the learning process of gradient boosting tree to user, and involves user's feedback operations to trees into the learning process. In TBT, ML is in charge of updating weights in learning model and filtering information shown to user from the big data, while visualization is in charge of providing a visual understanding of ML model to facilitate user exploration. It combines the advantages of both ML in big data statistics and human in decision making based on domain knowledge. We develop a user friendly interface for this novel learning method, and apply it to two datasets collected from real applications. Our study shows that making ML transparent by using interactive visualization can significantly improve the exploration of ML algorithms, give rise to novel insights of ML models, and integrates both machine and human intelligence.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 07:46:11 GMT  (4739kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05463v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["teng lee", "james johnson", "steve cheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05463"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.05463.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Interactive Machine Learning Framework", "authors": ["Teng Lee", "James Johnson", "Steve Cheng"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Author Keywords", "text": "Ensemble promotion, decision tree, interactive visualization, interpretable machine learning, transparent machine learning"}, {"heading": "ACM Classification Keywords", "text": "H.5.2 Information Interfaces and Presentation: MiscellaneousPermission to make digital or printed copies of all or part of this work for personal or intra-class use is granted without charge, provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial purposes, and that copies bear this notice and the full quote on the first page.

EnsembleMatrix [7] allows the user to select any combination of multiple classifiers to create a combination model after showing users the confusion matrix of all classifiers. Thus, it provides an interaction visualization tool that contributes to the emergence of user intelligence in the ML process. However, both the training and mode structure of each classifier are still invisible to the user. Some recent work, such as BigML1, focuses on visualizing the decision tree related to the ensemble enhancement in our project. However, the decision tree is less powerful and also easier than the ensemble boosting tree. In addition, they calculate all possible paths before they are shown to users, rather than immediately updating them, and allow users to perform fewer tree operations."}, {"heading": "TRANSPARENT BOOSTING TREE Learning Algorithm for Gradient Boosting Tree", "text": "One goal of TBT is to visualize the learning process and model structure of GBT. GBT builds additive model F (x) consisting of M decision trees hm (x) with input characteristics x, i.e. F (x) = M threshold of BT (x). (1) Each decision tree hm (x) is a weak learner who can handle mixed-type data and model complex nonlinear functions. (2) Similar to increasing the human threshold, GBT builds the additive model in a forward-stage manner such as thatFm (x) = Fm \u2212 1 (x) + \u03b3mhm (x) at each stage in which the complex human learning processes \u2212 Fm \u2212 1 (x), the current decision tree hm (x) is chosen to minimize the loss function."}, {"heading": "Design of Interactive Visualization Interface", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of us will be able to be in a position without being able to play by the rules, and that they will be able to play by the rules, \"he said in an interview with the New York Times."}, {"heading": "Exploration of GBT model in TBT", "text": "We show the visual encoding / exploration included in Figure 2. Although TBT allows the user to fully explore complex machine learning models, the detailed structure of each decision tree can be broken down by an animation and displayed in the tree view by clicking on the tree index listed in the forest view. Thus, the user is able to evaluate each tree by quickly going to its details. In the tree view, the user is able to explore the function and corresponding decision rule for each node, as well as the composite decision rule defined by each path, and the number of training samples associated with each edge of each path. In this way, the characteristics and decision rules can be evaluated by the user's knowledge. In addition, the prediction statistics for each node along the selected path can be displayed in bar charts within the path purity view. By examining the prediction styles, it is possible to determine the appropriate depth for the user's contribution, according to the scope of the resulting search."}, {"heading": "Interaction and User Operation in TBT", "text": "Another important finding of this paper is that TBT enables extensive user operations on the ML model and is able to use this user feedback as input of the learning algorithm in the next model update. As shown in Figure 3, users can operate on different scales of the GBT model. Specifically, they can remove / add any number of trees on the forest scale. In addition, at each stage of the learning process, the user can define a subset of features by \"allow / block\" in the features view, so that all features selected in the remaining trees are in the subset.On the tree scale, users can remove / add any node or expand any leaf node. This results in a feature selection. It is noteworthy that TBT supports a very powerful and useful feature called \"remove / expand this node for all,\" which is able to remove / add the selected node on all trees. This plays a role of the user's choice to mirror the setting of the global model."}, {"heading": "RESULTS", "text": "We apply TBT to two sets of data, i.e. fungi 2 and fusion health diabetics3. In the fungus data set, there are 8124 samples with 22 characteristics, and the goal is to train a classifier that separates toxic fungi and edible fungi. In the fusion health data set, there are 9948 training samples and 4979 test samples, and the goal is to detect if a patient has a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). TBT will create a GBT model for predictive tasks for the two sets of data. It shows that TBT is effective at presenting a transparent and interpretative understanding of the GBT model and its learning process to users. Despite the large number of samples and characteristics, TBT is able to show how the GBT model is established by integrating different features and decision rules using an ensemble of trees and how the model works on real data."}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "By applying TBT to the two real datasets, we find that it can provide several new insights that cannot be offered directly by running GBT on the datasets. Instead of blindly learning a large number of decision trees, we find that many decision trees learned in GBT share the same pathways or even have a very similar structure, suggesting that the complexity of GBT can be significantly reduced through user research. Second, TBT is able to show the characteristics or feature groups selected to create decision rules in the trees.2https: / / archive.ics.uci.edu / ml / datasets / Mushroom 3http: / / www.kaggle.com / c / pf2012-diabetes / dataThe predictive statistics along a path purity and training / test error shown in the history overview provide important clues to evaluate the roles and avoid the prerequisites we use and thus the decision-purity rules in the trees."}, {"heading": "FUTURE WORK", "text": "The collected data can be used to assess TBT more accurately. In addition, we plan to investigate if and when human intelligence in TBT is capable of improving the performance of ML in the loop. Both theoretical analysis and empirical studies are necessary to be carried out in the future. In addition, we will try to extend the transparent machine learning idea to other ML models and algorithms, and try to find out whether interactive visualization can lead to a new understanding of popular ML black boxes.
