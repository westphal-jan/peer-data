Along with the usual applications in digital forensics (De Vel et al., 2001; Stamatos, 2009) and plagiarism techniques to detect Shakespeare (Meuschke and Gipp, 2013), styleometry has also become the primary method of assessing authorship disputes in historical texts such as federalist papers (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964; Holmes and Forsyth, 1995) and Mormon writing (Holmes, 1992), in a field known as attribution of authorship. Such disputes exist in relation to the collection of dramatic works produced in England during the early modern era. Due to factors such as inaccurate front-page publication information and undocumented collaborations, the precise authorship of many of these pieces - including works by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher - remains highly contentious."}, {"heading": "2 Word Adjacency Networks", "text": "When we assign authors, we are assigned a number of candidates for the function: A = {a1, a2,., an} and a number of well-known texts written by each of these authors, and the aim is to correctly assign a collection of texts of unknown authorship among the authors. In (Segarra et al., 2015) we propose an author assignment method based on function words that only mediate grammatical relations between the so-called lexical words that carry meaning. Formally, we can construct a network of function words from a given text, including prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs and articles that only mediate grammatical relations between the so-called lexical words that carry meaning. We construct the networkWt = (F, Qt), where F = {f1, f2, ff} is the compilation of nodes that are composed by a collection of function words."}, {"heading": "3 Author Profiles", "text": "The stylometric analysis in this work focuses on the classification of plays written during the English Early Modern Period, which extends from the late 16th century to the early 17th century. William Shakespeare is the most prominent playwright active in this period, but there are several other authors who were also active during this period. For most of the papers, we focus on only six playwrights whose lifespan (in brackets) and assumed career leaps in relation to Shakespeare texts (in brackets) and assumed career advances are: 1 (1) George Chapman (1559-1634), active circa 1596-1620. Christopher Marlowe (1564-1593), active circa 1586-1593. (3) William Shakespeare (1564-1616), active circa 1589-1614.1. Information compiled from the database of early English Playbooks (DEEP) (Farmer and Lesser, 2007) and the database of plays catalogued online (LION) in literature."}, {"heading": "4 Similarity of Profiles", "text": "We calculate the relative entropy between each author profile for the six authors presented in Section 3 using expressions (7); see Table 1. Each entry in the table represents the relative entropy between the corresponding authors in the rows and columns. In this table, as in the rest of the paper, the relative entropy is multiplied by 100 to scale the numbers upwards, yielding results that are easier to compare by the eye. We use the term centinats, or, in short, the resulting unit of measurement of relative entropy. The 4.7 in the Chapman series and the Shakespeare column indicate a relative entropy of 4.7 cn between Chapman's and Shakespeare's profiles."}, {"heading": "5 Attribution of Plays", "text": "As a means of validating the accuracy of the WAN method on early modern English dramas, we first use it to ascribe the undisputed works of Jonson, Middleton, Chapman, Marlowe, Shakespeare and Fletcher among these six authors. If you ascribe to each given play, profiles are built that contain all the available texts. Intuitively, the profile that contains all the texts represents the writing style of a hypothetical average playwright from that period. This is done to make the characters easier to look at, but not to change the results in any way. Any raw relative entropy value is discredited by the same constant value, creating relative dissimilarity. As a result, both negative and positive relative entropy values are possible."}, {"heading": "5.1 Comparison with Existing Methods", "text": "Overall, our method correctly assigns 87 of the 94 single authors and elsewhere reliably ascribed plays in Table 5, resulting in an accuracy of 92.6%. Furthermore, if we only look at the attributions in which we have the greatest confidence, i.e. among authors who are more than 5cn apart from Table 1, then we fail only in 4, giving an accuracy of 95.7%. To compare the power of our method in mapping games from this era with the power of other methods commonly used in Shakespeare mapping studies, we perform the same validation tests on the 94 games using two common frequency-based methods. The first, known as the Burrows Delta Method, 2002) involves measuring word frequency vectors for each game. The frequency vectors are normalized to Z scores and compared with each other."}, {"heading": "6 Collaborations", "text": "In cases where multiple authors contribute to a single play, we can show how our method is able to recognize one or more of the authors present. We illustrate this ability in two ways: (i) by assigning profiles to collaborative plays that have arisen from other collaborations, and (ii) by assigning profiles to collaborative plays that have been created from plays written alone for each participating author."}, {"heading": "6.1 John Fletcher and Collaborators", "text": "John Fletcher wrote numerous plays both on his own and with collaborators, making him an appropriate case study of how our method handles co-authorship. In addition to the six profiles created for plays written alone in the previous section, we now include two profiles based on plays written by Fletcher in collaboration with his two most frequent co-authors: Francis Beaumont and Phillip Massinger; see Table 5. The mapping of Fletcher's collaborative work with Beaumont is shown in Fig. 8, while the mapping of Fletcher's collaborative work with Massinger is shown in Fig. 9. In both figures, we omit the marker that matches Marlowe, as it is poorly placed for each piece. This is consistent with Fletcher and Marlowe having the most diverse writing styles; see Table 1. In Fig. 8, seven of the eight Fletcher and Beaumont plays are correctly written by our only fingerprinting method, although Fletcher and Marlowe are not the second-best at fingerprinting."}, {"heading": "6.2 Other Collaborations", "text": "One of the deficiencies in the mapping method used to ascribe Fletcher's collaboration with Beaumont and Massinger VI is that it requires multiple collaborations between two authors, so that a reliable profile of each collaboration can be established. Therefore, we also examine the case where we ascribe a collaborative play by using only profiles of individual authors to Shakespeare. In Table 6 attached, we list a series of plays with either undisputed or speculative collaboration between several authors who have previously been profiled. These plays are attributed by our method by observing which of the six original author profiles comes closest to each Shakespeare play, with the results in Fig. 10. First, we write the play Eastward Ho, which is generally accepted as a collaboration between Jonson and Chapman and a third author to whom we have no attribution. In fact, our method places Jonson and Chapman in first and third place. We also assign two well-known collaborations between Shake spears and Fletcher, namely Henry III and Kinsley, both of which we prefer."}, {"heading": "7 Collaborations \u2013 Intraplay Analysis", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own if they are not able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "Jonson", "text": "Figure 11: Assignment of actions and scenes from Eastward Ho. Act 3 is assigned to Shakespeare (red), both Jonson (green) and Chapman (yellow). This assignment is an exception to the typical case, as a third author (Shakespeare) comes first for one of the assignments; however, we perform the scenic comparison only for Jonson and Chapman because they are the generally recognized co-authors. Same authors. Cases where an action is assigned to a third author - because our method suggests a candidate who was not previously considered by most other investigators - are identified in the captions. We note that according to Figure 11, all future characters appear in the appendix at the end of the document."}, {"heading": "7.1 Jonson and Chapman", "text": "We attribute both the individual acts and the scenes to the only known collaboration between Jonson and Chapman, Eastward Ho, which also includes contributions from a third author, John Marston. Figure 11 shows the results of the assignment of the act (left) and the scene (right). Compared to the eight authors, each act is assigned to Jonson, with the exception of Act III, Shakespeare. Chapman ranks either third or fourth in all acts, with the exception of Act III, in which he ranks second. However, these results are similar to the complete assignment of the play from Figure 10, in which Jonson was the highest-ranked author and Chapman ranked third. While these results in themselves do not highlight Chapman's specific contribution, a look at the assignment of the scenes between only Jonson and Chapman highlights some of Chapman's possible contributions. Most of the play is still assigned to Jonson, but Chapman is considered a more likely candidate in Scenes 3.3 and 5.2, whereas Chapon's assignment to Chapon's 3.1 and 3.2 leads to the result."}, {"heading": "7.2 Shakespeare and Fletcher", "text": "In Fig. 12 we show the assignment of individual actions and scenes of Two Noble Kinsmen, a well-known collaboration between Shakespeare and Fletcher 3. While in Fig. 10 the play as a whole is assigned to Shakespeare with Fletcher as the second-best candidate, here Acts 1 and 5 are assigned to Shakespeare, while Acts 2 and 3 are assigned to Fletcher. Act 4 is assigned to Fletcher with Shakespeare and Jonson nearby. Remember that in Fig. 12 distances are shown to only the two closest candidates for easier viewing. A closer look at the assignment of the scene, in which we only consider Shakespeare and Fletcher as candidates, reveals more specific assignments. Shakespeare is assigned scenes 1,1, 1,2, 1,4, 3,1, 3,2, 4,3, 5,1, 5,3, and 5,3. Fletcher is assigned."}, {"heading": "7.3 Shakespeare and Middleton", "text": "We analyze in Fig. 14-16 Middleton's contributions to Shakespeare's plays Macbeth, Measure for Measure, and Timon of Athens. Assignment of the complete plays in Fig. 10 does not suggest that Middleton has made a significant contribution to these plays. Intraplay analysis of Macbeth at the level of plot and scenes shown in Fig. 14 supports this conclusion. A total of two scenes are attributed to Middleton via Shakespeare, namely Scenes 1.1 and 5.1. Scene 5.1 is attributed to Middleton with only a small distance of 1cn, while Scene 1.1 is attributed with a greater distance of over 4cn. Scientists have frequently characterized scenes 1.2, 3.5, and 4.1 as scenes that Middleton has edited or contributed (Wells, 2009), although we find no evidence of this in our analyses. The case of Measure for Measure for Shakespeare's Scare 2 is even clearer; both the plot and the scene analysis shown in Fig. 15 is some of the author."}, {"heading": "7.4 Shakespeare and Marlowe", "text": "Although there is no unanimous agreement on the collaboration between Shakespeare and Marlowe, there are a number of plays with controversial authorship that have not been the subject of scholarly treatment in relation to Marlowe's contributions. Of the traditional Shakespeare canons, the three parts of Henry VI are the most common points of contention. We analyze the authorship of these plays using the WAN Method in depth in (Segarra et al., 2016). We extend this analysis to include two anonymously published plays previously attributed at least in part to Shakespeare and Marlowe, namely Arden of Faversham and Edward II. We perform the intraplay analysis of the play Arden of Faversham in Fig. 17. Each act is attributed to Shakespeare before our seven other candidates. Although not shown in the character, the second preferred candidate in all acts except Jonson, who is not generally believed to have begun writing plays, while Arden of Faversham was written between 1587 and 1592 (Taylor and Louane 497)."}, {"heading": "7.5 Shakespeare and Peele", "text": "Shakespeare's play, Titus Andronicus, is generally accepted as co-writing with Peele (Vickers, 2002) and ascribed to Shakespeare with a minimum distance of less than 1cn. Typical attributions of this play, such as that of Brian Vickers (Vickers, 2002), ascribe scenes 2.1 and 4.4 to Peele in the scene attributions. Recently, William W. Weber has expressed doubts about Peele's authorship of scene 4.1 (Weber, 2014), finding strong reasons to ascribe it to Shakespeare, and our method agrees with Weber's conclusion. The so-called \"fly\" scene, 3.2, is present in the folio of 1623, but not in the quarto editions, suggesting that it was a later addition to the play, and that this scene may have been added by another author."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "The networks of each text that was known to have been written by a particular author were combined into a profile network, and the profile networks were then compared to determine the general similarity between the author styles; each text in an author's corpus was compared to each profile and assigned to the author whose profile network produced the least relative entropy; the assignment of all authors reached an accuracy of 92.6%. Subsequently, the classification power in relation to plays written by multiple authors was further evaluated, both by assigning an entire piece and its individual act and scene components; the plots and scenes were analyzed individually in a series of plays with highly contentious co-authorship, in which we corrupt both existing and existing breakdowns, as well as find new evidence of the assignment between tools that were effective in the era before and now."}, {"heading": "9 Funding", "text": "This work is supported by the National Science Foundation CAREER CCF-0952867, the National Science Foundation CCF-1217963 and AHRC AH / N007654 / 1."}, {"heading": "Shakespeare", "text": "Fletcher"}, {"heading": "Shakespeare", "text": "Figure 13: Assignment of Henry VIII's actions and scenes between Shakespeare (red) and Fletcher (blue).1 2 3 4 5 02468101214160 2 4 6 81. 1 1 1. 2 1. 3 1. 4 1. 5 1. 6 1. 7 2 2. 3 2. 4 3. 2 3. 4 3. 5 4. 1 5. 2 5. 2 5. 2 5. 3 5. 5 5 5. 6 5. 7R elat ive sim ilarit yto pro file (cen tinat s) Middleton"}, {"heading": "Shakespeare", "text": "Middleton"}, {"heading": "Shakespeare", "text": "Middleton"}, {"heading": "Shakespeare", "text": "Figure 16: Assignment of actions and scenes of Timon of Athens between Shakespeare (red) and Middleton (orange).1 2 3 4 5 01234560 1 2 31. 1 2. 1 2. 2 3. 1 3. 2 3. 3. 4 3. 5 3. 6 4. 1 4. 3 4 4 4 5. 4 5. 1 5. 2 5. 3 5. 4 5. 5 5. 6R elat ive sim ilarit yto pro file (cen tinat s) Marlowe"}, {"heading": "Shakespeare", "text": "Marlowe"}, {"heading": "Shakespeare", "text": "Peele"}, {"heading": "Shakespeare", "text": "Figure 19: Titus Andronicus \"plot and scenes are mapped between Shakespeare (red) and Peele (blue).

The techniques used in modern authorship attribution began almost a century ago by examining sentence lengths in texts to determine authorship (Yule, 1939).

Since profiling accuracy increases with the length of the texts used in building the profile, we use all texts of sole authorship that have little or no history of authorship dispute. The full list of plays used to build the six profiles is reported in Table 5 in the Appendix. When building profiles for a given author, we generally use the DEEP database (Farmer and Lesser, 2007) to determine texts of sole authorship. An exception to this is Middleton, for whom the 2007 Oxford Collected Works of Middleton (Taylor and Lavagnino, 2007) is taken as the most reliable source. Notice that each profile is built from a different number of texts. Marlowe, the least prolific writer of the ones here considered, is accepted as the sole author of 6 plays containing a total of 103,160 words. Shakespeare, the most prolific writer, is the undisputed sole author of 28 plays, containing 679,256 words. Due to this difference, we compute the relative entropy between the WAN of an unknown text and each profile using (7) rather than (6). In order to prevent distortions introduced by different editions handling modernization differently\u2013Shakespeare typically being more heavily modernized than other writers\u2013we rely on the earliest editions available of each text in the LION database (Chadwyck-Healey/ProQuest), with the exception of Shakespeare plays for which multiple early editions exist.
