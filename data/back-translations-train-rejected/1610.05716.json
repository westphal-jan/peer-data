Parallelism", "text": "Genetic algorithms (Holland, 1975) are population-based search and optimization techniques that are inherently parallel, for example, allowing multiple offspring to be evaluated at the same time. Consequently, the multi-population approach of coevolutionary algorithms (Husbands and Mill, 1991) offers even more possibilities to use parallelism, for example, allowing multiple offspring combinations to be evaluated at the same time. Consequently, there is a growing number of work in which graphical processing units process evolutionary algorithms in parallel, thereby reducing the time needed to find suitable solutions (Liu et al., 2015). Similar to the use of graphics processing units for parallel hardware processing, we use several 3D printers and multiple physical test devices in this paper to evaluate new MFC designs in parallel."}, {"heading": "2.3. Adaptive population sizing", "text": "Most evolutionary algorithms determine the number of parents and offspring during optimization, but it has long been suggested that the number of offspring should be adjusted for evolutionary convergence in order to improve progress per assessment of fitness function (Hansen et al., 1995).The underlying concept is to adjust population size to the smallest necessary to maintain sufficient (genetic) diversity and thus maintain the number of fitness function evaluations per generation.Recently, LaPort et al. (2015) have shown that adjusting parental population size in terms of mutation and fitness rates can optimize search diversity, thereby improving fitness and convergence. See Karafotias et al. (2015) for an overview of parameter control in evolutionary algorithms, including population size."}, {"heading": "2.4. The NKCS model", "text": "Kauffman and Johnsen (1991) introduced the abstract NKCS model to allow the study of various aspects of the co-evolution of fitness. In their model, an individual is represented by a genome of N (binary) genes, on which each epistatically depends other randomly selected genes in his genome. Thus, the increase of K in relation to N increases epistatic linkage and increases the robustness of the fitness landscapes by increasing the total number of fitness peaks, increasing the steepness of the sides of the fitness peaks and decreasing their typical heights. Each gene is also said to depend on randomly selected characteristics in each of the other X species with which it interacts, where there is an overall S-number of fitness peaks. A species \"adaptive movements can deform the fitness landscape (s) of its partner (s) and decrease its typical heights."}, {"heading": "3.

Methodology", "text": "In this paper there are 5 cascades consisting of 4 MFCs in parallel, where each cascade is physically doubled and the average power is then used."}, {"heading": "3.2. Results", "text": "The performance of the different assessment strategies is shown for 4 different K and C values in Fig. 2, each representing a different point in the range of inter- and intra-population dependence. Performance of the same strategies with increasing population size is shown in Fig. 3.The results show that there is little difference between the algorithms in the early stages of evolution. Table 1, for example, shows that after 400 assessments, there is no significant difference when K and C are greater than 2. However, the assessment of all offspring after 2000 is significantly greater for all values of K and C, showing that this approach is able to seek a larger design space while following increases in the fitness gradient. Extending the population size does not appear to provide any performance enhancement for the algorithms; see Table 2, which shows that there are no significant differences. As physical testing of MFCs is a time-consuming process, there is only a small assessment budget and therefore no benefit appears to consist of additional research at the same time."}, {"heading": "4.

Conclusions", "text": "The use of cascade configurations and 3-D pressure components has recently been identified as significant opportunities to improve MFCs (Walter et al., 2016; Papaharalabos et al., 2015). The design and optimization of the anode electrode has been highlighted as critical for performance and scalability, as it is central to biocatalysis through bacterial adhesion and electron transfer. By repeatedly creating and testing physical designs, as proposed by computer-aided intelligence, it may be possible to detect and utilize previously unknown or insufficiently understood physical interactions. In this paper, we have demonstrated that such an approach can be used to design conductive structures that complement the existing anodes in MFC units and form a cascade system. The structures have been inserted into the anodic chamber, facilitating the testing of new designs to optimize biocompatibility, the overall conductivity, the surface stability, and the hydro-cascade dynamics."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under funding number EP / N005740 / 1."}], "references": [{"title": "Continuous electricity generation at high voltages and currents using stacked microbial fuel cells", "author": ["P.

Among these, feedstock distribution within cascades is particularly important since feedstock composition changes throughout the stack, which in essence changes the internal resistance. Design mining is the use of computational intelligence techniques to iteratively search and model the attribute space of physical objects evaluated directly through rapid prototyping to meet given objectives. It enables the exploitation of novel materials and processes without formal models or complex simulation, whilst harnessing the creativity of both computational and human design methods. A sample-model-search-sample loop creates an agile/flexible approach, i.e., primarily test-driven, enabling a continuing process of prototype design consideration and criteria refinement by both producers and users. We have recently demonstrated the success of the approach to discover new wind turbine designs (Preen and Bull, 2014, 2015, 2016). In this paper, we explore the application of design mining for MFC cascade design.

The quantity of electrons flowing through the external circuit is the electricity being produced, i.e., current. For MFC scale-up in terms of power generation, two distinct approaches have been suggested. The first is to increase the size of an individual MFC (Logan, 2010). The second is to build a multitude of relatively small MFCs connected electrically (Ledezma et al., 2013; Ieropoulos et al., 2016). In the case of the second approach, the output of an MFC system is amplified by the number of MFC units employed, similar to how batteries can be connected together. Scaleup is also vital to treat certain volumes of wastewater. It is generally accepted that continuous flow is more favourable for both stable power generation and the treatment of large volumes of wastewater. In a cascade system, the original feedstock is supplied to the first MFC unit positioned on the top of the cascade. Its effluent flows to the unit immediately below; the effluent of the first MFC therefore becomes the substrate for the downstream MFC. This is the same for third, fourth, etc. The performance of each MFC, in terms of the amount of substrate utilised, reproduction of anodic microorganisms or by-products from substrate utilisation, can therefore have a significant effect on other MFCs, despite not being connected hydraulically. For example, downstream MFCs are likely to be fed with a lower concentration of feedstock compared with the MFCs upstream since some of the readily available substrates are depleted before arrival. When single or multiple units experience substrate depletion, the power output is consequently reduced. In the long term, this can affect the anodic biofilm, causing the units to permanently underperform. Hence, providing sufficient quality feedstock to each MFC unit in a stack is essential. One solution is to supply high concentrations of feedstock to cascades, to ensure all of the units have sufficient fuel. However, for maximum substrate utilisation and therefore maximum waste treatment efficiency, this may not be the best approach. Other operating parameters such as the flow rate, which consequently determines HRT, can be tuned to achieve both efficient energy production and waste treatment. Given that a cascade has only one source of feedstock flow, different HRT for individual MFC units in the cascade can be formed by changing the volume of each unit. Walter et al.

For practical applications, it has been suggested that greater efficiency can be achieved by arranging multiple MFC units into physical stacks in a cascade with feedstock flowing sequentially between units. In this paper, we investigate the use of computational intelligence to physically explore and optimise (potentially) heterogeneous MFC designs in a cascade, i.e. without simulation. Conductive structures are 3-D printed and inserted into the anodic chamber of each MFC unit, augmenting a carbon fibre veil anode and affecting the hydrodynamics, including the feedstock volume and hydraulic retention time, as well as providing unique habitats for microbial colonisation. We show that it is possible to use design mining to identify new conductive inserts that increase both the cascade power output and power density.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
