ANATOMIZATION DECISION TREES", "text": "We examine three possible approaches to building decision trees from anatomized data in the client-server database model by Nergiz et al. We refer to this family of decision trees as anatomization decision trees because they are all composed of anatomized data. Each approach differs depending on how IT and ST tables are used. In the discussion of anatomization decision trees, it is assumed that algorithms that require encryption use symmetrical key encryption AES-128. We first discuss two basic approaches: pure client-side learning and pure server-side learning. Section 3.2 explains the collaborative learning of decision trees. Finally, we compare collaborative learning with the basics in Section 3.3."}, {"heading": "3.1 Baseline Approaches: CDBS Learning and Client Na\u00efve Learning", "text": "That is why it has come to the point where it has never come to this."}, {"heading": "3.2 Collaborative Decision Tree Learning", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "3.3 Cost Discussion", "text": "It is difficult to estimate a practical average cost saving for collaborative decision-tree learning, as it depends not only on the data, but also on the cost of storage, processing and communication resources of the customer. If the identifying attributes are bad predictors, the base decision tree will be complex. However, a complex decision-tree model means that the cost per sub-tree will be small, although the total cost (amortized over many predictions) is high. If the identifying attributes are good predictors, the base decision tree will be easy to achieve a good prediction. However, small leaves mean that the cost per sub-tree will be small, although the total cost (amortized over many predictions) is high. If the identifying attributes are good predictors, the base decision tree will yield fewer splits, but larger leaves. This increases the cost of the initial prediction, but also increases the likelihood that a decision will be made in the future."}, {"heading": "4.

CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper proposes a method for learning decision trees for outsourced data in an anatomization scheme. To accomplish this prediction task, a real prediction task is defined: Collaborative Decision Tree Learning (cdtl), which uses cloud database server (CDBS) and client, is investigated. Cdtl is proven to preserve the privacy of the data provider. Cdtl is tested on different sets of data and the results show that relatively accurate decision trees can be built while significantly reducing the customer's learning and inference costs. The next challenge is to expand this work in a new framework so that no client processing takes place while precise decision trees are learned. Another direction is to observe how the collaborative decision tree learning algorithm performs compared to recent differential decision trees."}, {"heading": "6.
