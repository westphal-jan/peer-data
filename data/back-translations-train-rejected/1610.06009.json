This paper proposes two constraint handling approaches for an emerging metaheuristic of Cohort Intelligence (CI). More specifically CI with static penalty function approach (SCI) and CI with dynamic penalty function approach (DCI) are proposed. The approaches have been tested by solving several constrained test problems. The performance of the SCI and DCI have been compared with algorithms like GA, PSO, ABC, d-Ds. In addition, as well as three real world problems from mechanical engineering domain with improved solutions. The results were satisfactory and validated the applicability of CI methodology for solving real world problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 16:36:39 GMT  (1033kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06009v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["omkar kulkarni", "ninad kulkarni", "anand j kulkarni", "ganesh kakandikar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06009"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.06009.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Constrained Cohort Intelligence using Static and Dynamic Penalty Function Approach for Mechanical Components Design", "authors": ["Omkar Kulkarni", "Ninad Kulkarni", "Anand J Kulkarni", "Ganesh Kakandikar"], "emails": ["kulk0003@uwindsor.ca;", "anand.kulkarni@sitpune.edu.in;", "kulk0003@ntu.edu.sg,"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Most people who are in this country have a different idea of themselves: they have another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world, another world."}, {"heading": "4.1.1.

It is necessary to minimize thickening in order to maintain the quality of the product. Determining the thickness distribution and thinning of the sheet metal cut reduces the production costs of the material and time. The ultimate goal of the deep-drawing process in particular, or of any sheet metal forming process in general, is to produce a good quality product, so uniform thickness should be achieved everywhere. Thickening minimization of the end cap in the deep-drawing process has been solved by SCI and DCI."}, {"heading": "4.3.1.
