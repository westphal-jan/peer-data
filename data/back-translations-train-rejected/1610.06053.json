Thus, for example, the English dog and the German dog are cognates that can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic stage. However, high-precision automatic identification of cognates is desired to reduce the effort needed to analyze large language families such as Indo-European (Bouckaert et al., 2012) and Austronesian (Greenhill and Gray, 2009). An automatic identification system can be helpful for historical linguists to analyze supposedly related language families and also to speed up the creation of cognitive databases that can then be analyzed using Bayesian phylogenetic methods (Atkinson and Gray, 2006). In this paper, we work with Swadesh word lists of multiple language groups and attempt to link coherent words."}, {"heading": "2 Cognate clustering", "text": "Phylogenetic sequencing methods require appropriate judgments, which are only available for a small number of well-studied language families such as Indo-European and Austronesian. Thus, the ASJP database (Brown et al., 2013) provides 1 Swadesh word list (of 40 lengths, which are said to be important for the identification of genetic relationships between languages), which are transcribed in a uniform format for more than 60% of the languages of the world.2 An example of such a word list is listed below: The task is to automatically group words according to a genealogical relationship to clusters. This is achieved by calculating similarities between all word pairs belonging to a meaning and then providing the resulting distance matrix as an input into a cluster algorithm. The cluster algorithm groups the words into clusters by optimizing a similarity criterion. The similarity between a word pair can be calculated by supervised approaches (Hauer and Nedrak, 2011) or by using sequence algorithms such as the wish algorithms (table 2)."}, {"heading": "3 Sequence alignment", "text": "The Needleman Wish Algorithm maximizes similarity, while the Levenshtein Distance decreases similarity by 1 and a letter imbalance by \u2212 1. Unlike Levenshtein Distance, where insertion, deletion, and substitution are treated equally, the Needleman Wish Algorithm introduces a gap opening (deletion operation) that must be learned separately. A second parameter, known as the Gap Extension Penalty, has a lesser penalty than the gap opening parameter and models the fact that gap opening in the gap opening (deletion operation) is a gap opening value (deletion operation). A second parameter, known as the Gap Extension Penalty, is a lesser penalty than the gap opening parameter and the fact that gap opening parameters occur in the gap opening (Yes Wish Algorithm, 2013) is a (The Vanleman)."}, {"heading": "4 CRP", "text": "In this section, we describe the CRP algorithm and motivate its suitability for clustering. With a meaning M and the word similarity matrix S of dimensions N \u00b7 N, the CRP algorithm works as follows: \u2022 The CRP outputs K clusters and clustering l1,.. lK 1. First assign a word wn to ln, where K = N.2. Repeat until convergence: \u2022 For each word wn: - Remove wn from its cluster. - Calculate snk the average similarity of wn to all words in cluster k. - If argmaxksnk < \u03b1 assign wn to a new cluster. - Otherwise assign wn to the cluster kwhere k = argmax k snk.The current algorithm uses the criterion the average similarity of wn. (The criterion to determine the average similarity of clusters). A word is assigned to the cluster with which it shows the highest average similarity."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "Baseline We use a vanilla needleman wish in our experiments with a gap-opening penalty of \u2212 1 and a gap-widening penalty of \u2212 0.5 as the baseline. LexStat LexStat (List, 2012) is a system that provides state-of-the-art algorithms for aligning word pairs and clustering them into related groups.3 The LexStat system weighs matches between sounds using a handmade segment similarity matrix influenced by historical linguistic literature.3 The average similarity criterion can be modified to the maximum similarity criterion, commonly referred to as single linkage clustering (Manning and Sch\u00fctze, 1999)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Evaluation", "text": "We evaluate the results of the cluster analysis using the B-cubed F score (Amigo \u0301 et al., 2009).The B-cubed score is defined for each item as follows: The accuracy of an item is defined as the ratio between the number of cognates in its cluster and the total number of items in its cluster. The B-cubed score is defined as the ratio between the number of cognates in its cluster and the total number of cognates designated as experts. The B-cubed Fscore for the entire data set is defined as the average of precision and recall in all clusters. Finally, the B-cubed F score for any meaning is calculated as the harmonic mean of average precision and the recall of the item. The B-cubed Fscore for the entire data set is used as the average of B-cubed F scores in all meanings.2016 cubed as well as Hk (Konet) and F-List."}, {"heading": "5.2 Datasets", "text": "The IELex database was created by Dyen et al. (1992) and curated by Michael Dunn. The IELex database is not transcribed in a uniform IPA and contains many forms transcribed in the romanized IPA format by Dyen et al. (1992). We cleaned the IELex database of all non-IPA-like transcriptions and converted the purified subset of the database into the ASJP format. The purified subset has 52 languages and 210 meanings. The Austronesian vocabulary database The Austronesian Vocabulary Database (ABVD) (Greenhill and Gray, 2009) has word lists for 210 Swadesh concepts and 378 languages. The database has no transcriptions in a uniform IPA format. We removed all symbols that do not appear in the standard IPA database and converted the 100 encyclopaedias to JASP at random."}, {"heading": "6 Results", "text": "The CRP-based PMI system performs better than LexStat on four data sets. The CRP algorithm performs slightly worse than the LexStat system on Austronesian and Indo-European language families by two points. The LexStat system only performs better than the PMI CRP system on Ugric language records. The cluster threshold of the LexStat system has been adjusted for many smaller data sets, whereas the PMI CRP does not require any threshold adjustment and comes closer to or better off the LexStat system."}, {"heading": "6.1 Match between predicted and obtained clusters", "text": "We examine the correlation between the number of predicted clusters and the number of true clusters for the PMI CRP system across different meanings. We report on the correlations in Table 4. The correlations indicate that the number of predicted clusters strongly correlates with the actual number of clusters across datasets."}, {"heading": "6.2 Error analysis", "text": "In the case of Indo-Europeans, the PMI CRP system fails to group all the reflexes for the meaning \"five,\" \"fingernail,\" \"three,\" \"two,\" and \"name\" into a single contiguous cluster due to the extensive phonological change affecting cognates of all subsidiary subgroups. LexStat also exhibits similar behavior when the actual number of clusters belonging together is 1."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "The program takes less than two minutes to cluster a large dataset of 100 languages such as Austronesian. We tested the algorithm on a variety of language families and demonstrated that the algorithm delivers close to or better results than LexStat. Based on the results, we claim that the algorithm can be useful for comparative linguists to analyze putative language relationships at a rapid pace. By comparison, even LexStat makes mistakes in clustering these meanings. Whenever the reflexes have similar wording forms, in the case of Maya (meanings: \"water\" and \"die\") the algorithm groups all reflexes into a single cluster without errors. As part of future work, we plan to use the cluster families for the use of Yyeansis and Bayeansis data bases in genetic clusters."}], "references": [{"title": "Javier Artiles", "author": ["Enrique Amig\u00f3", "Julio Gonzalo"], "venue": "and Felisa Verdejo.", "citeRegEx": "Amig\u00f3 et al.2009", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2009}, {"title": "Atkinson and Russell D", "author": ["D Quentin"], "venue": "Gray.", "citeRegEx": "Atkinson and Gray2006", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2006}, {"title": "and Quentin D", "author": ["Remco Bouckaert", "Philippe Lemey", "Michael Dunn", "Simon J.
