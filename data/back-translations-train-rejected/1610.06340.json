A key function of an online social network (OSN), in addition to sharing, is that it allows users to express their personal opinions about a product or a trend of messages through posts, likes / dislikes, etc. However, such opinions are passed on to other users and could have a significant impact on them. The real world is full of inaccuracy and uncertainty and this fact inevitably affects the OSN data. In fact, social interactions cannot always be precise and secure, even OSN only allows limited access to their data, which creates more inaccuracy and uncertainty. Then, if we ignore this imperfection, we are confronted with erroneous analytical results."}, {"heading": "2 Maximizing positive opinion influence", "text": "In this section we present our measurement of the positive influence on opinion and the proposed algorithm to maximize influence."}, {"heading": "2.1 Influence measure", "text": "Considering a social network G = (V, E), a discriminatory framework that expresses influence and passivity, a discriminatory framework that expresses influence and passivity, an influence that expresses influence and passivity, an influence that expresses influence and passivity, a probability distributor that expresses the influence that the user u exerts on the user. The first step of the influencing maximization process is to measure the influence of each user on the network and a basic belief allocation (BBA) function. Then, we propose an influencing parameter to estimate the positive impact of each user on the network. The mass value MVP (u, v) (I) measures the impact of u on the product."}, {"heading": "2.2 Influence maximization", "text": "In this section we introduce the evidently positive opinion influence maximization model. Its purpose is to find a series of nodes S that maximize the objective function \u03c3 (S). In view of a directed social network G = (V, E), an integer k \u2264 | V |, the goal is to find a group of users S V, | S | = k that maximizes the number of pages (S). We have proven that \u03c3 (S) is monotonous and submodular, hence the influence maximization under the proposed model NP-hard. However, the limitation of the number of pages prevents us from presenting evidence in detail. The influence maximization under the evidently positive opinion influence maximization model is NP-hard, hence the greedy algorithm performs a good approximation for the optimal solution NP-hard. However, the limitation of the number of pages prevents us from presenting evidence in detail. The influence maximization under the evidently positive opinion influence maximization model is NP-forward, hence the greedy algorithm performs a good approximation for the optimal solution, especially if we use it with this formula: The user under the evidently positive opinion maximixing model S, in particular S, maximizing the positive opinion maximization algorithm-forward, maximizing the positive S, maximizing an algorithm-forward, maximizing the influence model of the positive S, maximizing forward, is a good algorithm-hard for the use algorithm-forward."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "In this section, we conduct some experiments with real data. We used the Twitter4j2 library, which is a Java implementation of the Twitter API, to collect Twitter data. We combed the Twitter network for the period between 2http: / / twitter4j.org / en / index.html08 / 09 / 2014 and 03 / 11 / 2014, and we filtered our data by only keeping tweets that talk about smartphones and users who have at least one tweet in the database. To estimate the opinion polarity of each tweet in our dataset, we first used the Java library \"Stanford POS Tagger\" 3 with the model \"GATE Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger\" 4 designed for tweets. This step gives a tag (verb, noun, etc.) to each word in the tweet. After estimating the opinion polarity of each tweet, we use the WordNet step 3.05 dictionary and tags from the first one."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we have proposed a new parameter of influence that assesses the positive influence of OSN users.
