The proposed system differs from the well-known cascade systems in its capability to process multidimensional time series in an online mode, which makes it possible to process non-stationary stochastic and chaotic signals with the required accuracy. Compared to conventional analogs, the proposed system provides computational simplicity and possesses both tracking and filtering capabilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:27:51 GMT  (328kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06485v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["yevgeniy v bodyanskiy", "oleksii k tyshchenko", "daria s kopaliani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06485"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.06485.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Multidimensional Cascade Neuro-Fuzzy System with Neuron Pool Optimization in Each Cascade", "authors": ["Yevgeniy V.

Conventionally, \"learning\" is defined as the process of adapting synaptic weights, which involves the search for extremism of a given learning criterion. The quality of the learning process can be improved by adapting its synaptic weights. [1, 2] This idea is the basis of evolutionary computational intelligence. [3, 4] One of the most successful implementations of this approach is the high efficiency and simplification of synaptic systems."}], "references": [{"title": "Neural Networks for Optimization and Signal Processing", "author": ["A.
