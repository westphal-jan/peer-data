Several methods have been designed to infer the authorship of disputed documents in multiple contexts. While traditional statistical methods based solely on word counts and related measurements have provided a simple, yet effective solution in particular cases; they are prone to manipulation. Recently, texts have been successfully modeled as networks, where words are represented by nodes linked according to textual similarity measurements. Such models are useful to identify informative topological patterns for the authorship recognition task. However, there is no consensus on which measurements should be used. Thus, we proposed a novel method to characterize text networks, by considering both topological and dynamical aspects of networks. Using concepts and methods from cellular automata theory, we devised a strategy to grasp informative spatio-temporal patterns from this model. Our experiments revealed an outperformance over traditional analysis relying only on topological measurements. Remarkably, we have found a dependence of pre-processing steps (such as the lemmatization) on the obtained results, a feature that has mostly been disregarded in related works. The optimized results obtained here pave the way for a better characterization of textual networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 17:00:42 GMT  (5806kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06498v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jeaneth machicao", "edilson a corr\\^ea jr", "gisele h b miranda", "diego r amancio", "odemir m bruno"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06498"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.06498.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Authorship Attribution Based on Life-Like Network Automata", "authors": ["Jeaneth Machicao", "Edilson A.

Some network measurements used to explore the properties of networks are presented. Next, we discuss the word adjacency model used in this article and their respective measurements, and the measurements extracted from the life-like network dynamics are then used to characterize the style of each authority.

We have specifically investigated the impact of textual organization on the discriminability of documents written by different authors. To do this, we have used the well-known network framework that reveals its potential in related applications. Unlike the traditional approach, which is based only on the topological characteristics of networks, we have proposed a methodology for collecting further information relating to certain styles of authors. To this end, we have represented networks that provide texts with a dynamic based on life-like rules."}], "references": [{"title": "A systematic study of knowledge graph analysis for cross-language plagiarism detection", "author": ["M.

Abstract The authorship attribution is a problem of considerable practical and technical interest. Several methods have been designed to infer the authorship of disputed documents in multiple contexts. While traditional statistical methods based solely on word counts and related measurements have provided a simple, yet effective solution in particular cases; they are prone to manipulation. Recently, texts have been successfully modeled as networks, where words are represented by nodes linked according to textual similarity measurements. Such models are useful to identify informative topological patterns for the authorship recognition task. However, there is no consensus on which measurements should be used. Thus, we proposed a novel method to characterize text networks, by considering both topological and dynamical aspects of networks. Using concepts and methods from cellular automata theory, we devised a strategy to grasp informative spatio-temporal patterns from this model. Our experiments revealed an outperformance over traditional analysis relying only on topological measurements. Remarkably, we have found a dependence of pre-processing steps (such as the lemmatization) on the obtained results, a feature that has mostly been disregarded in related works. The optimized results obtained here pave the way for a better characterization of textual networks.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
