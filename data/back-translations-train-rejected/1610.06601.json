THEORETICAL BACKGROUND", "text": "The most common unmonitored WSD algorithm is Lesk Algorithm, which uses WordNet as an online dictionary. The algorithm is briefly described below:"}, {"heading": "2.1 Preliminaries of Lesk Algorithm", "text": "The typical reading algorithm selects a short phrase from the sentence containing an ambiguous word. Then, the dictionary definition (gloss) of each of the meanings of the ambiguous word is compared with the gloss of the other words of that particular sentence. An ambiguous word is assigned to the respective meaning whose gloss has the highest number of overlaps (number of common words) with the gloss of the other words in the sentence. Example 1: \"Aries and Sita go to the bank every day to withdraw money.\" Here, the expression is taken according to the window size (number of consecutive words). If window size is 3, then the phrase would be \"Bank Withdrawal.\" All other words are discarded as \"Stopwords.\" Consider the gloss of all the words presented in that particular sentence as follows: Suppose the number of the senses of \"bank\" is 2 such as \"X\" and \"Y\" (see Table 1). The number of the senses of \"Go\" is like \"A\" and \"B\" (see Table 2). \""}, {"heading": "Keyword Probable sense", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Word Probable sense", "text": "Consider the word \"bank\" as a keyword: the number of common words is measured between two sentences."}, {"heading": "Pair of Sentences Common number of Words", "text": "Table 4 shows all possibilities on the basis of sentences from Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 and the number of words that occur in every possible pairing. Finally, two senses of the keyword \"bank\" have their counter states (see Table 4) as follows: X counter, XC = A '+ B' + M '+ N'. Y counter, YC = A \"+ B\" + M \"+ N.\" Therefore, one would assign a higher counter value to the keyword \"bank\" in the respective sentence."}, {"heading": "2.2 Simple (unsmoothed) N-gram and Bigram Model", "text": "N-gram [32] is used to calculate the probability of a complete word sequence (which can be represented either as w1.... wn or w1 n). If each word is considered as an independent event in its proper position, the probability is represented as follows: P (W1, W2,......, Wn-1, Wn).The chain rule for breaking down probability would be: P (W1 n) = P (W1) P (W2 | W1) P (W3 | W1 2).... P (Wn | W1 n-1).But calculating the probability like P (Wn | W1 n-1) is not easy for a long sequence of preceding words. The Bigram model approaches the probability of a word in relation to all preceding words P (Wn | W1 n-1) at the conditional probability of the preceding word P (Wn | Wn-1)."}, {"heading": "3.

OUTPUT AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The algorithm is tested on more than 100 texts of varying lengths and categories, with an average length of 200 sentences, selecting two ambiguous words for testing: \"Bank\" and \"Plant.\" Next, the simplified reading algorithm is applied to the input text containing the POS-marked ambiguous word. As the POS of the ambiguous word is derived earlier, only the dictionary definitions from WordNet for the WSD process that belong to the same POS domain as the POS of the ambiguous word are selected. As a result, the execution time of the WSD process is shortened (see Table 5). It is also observed that as the relevant glosses for the WSD process are taken into account, the accuracy of the ambiguous meaning is increased (see text no. 10). Some of the results of the target word \"Bank\" are given in the sense of Table 5. All sample texts are taken from \"wiikia.com.\""}, {"heading": "Text no. 10:", "text": "Plants, also called green plants, are living organisms of the Plantae Kingdom, including multicellular groups such as flowering plants, conifers, ferns and mosses, as well as, according to definition, green algae, but not red or brown algae such as seaweed, nor fungi or bacteria. Green plants have cell walls containing cellulose and characteristically derive most of their energy from sunlight through photosynthesis using chlorophyll, which is found in chlorophyll, which gives them their green color. Some plants are parasitic and may not produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or photosynthesis. Plants are also characterized by sexual reproduction, modular and indeterminate growth, and generational change, although asexual reproduction is common, and some plants bloom only once, while others have only one flower. Accurate numbers are difficult to ascertain, but as of 2010 there are probably 300-315,000 plant species, the vast majority of which are molten plants, some are 260 plants, the largest, and most diverse."}, {"heading": "Output:", "text": "Target word: plant.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "The proposed approach speeds up the WSD procedure by filtering the only relevant glosses and also increases the accuracy of the WSD procedure. Time differences between the two cases (with and without POS tagging procedure) could be increased if few system calls and other system-related tasks are handled properly. The obvious operations (loop, memory allocation, status check, function call, etc.) for POS tagging took some time, which is included in the cited result.
