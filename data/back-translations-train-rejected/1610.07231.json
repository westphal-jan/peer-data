In this paper, we reviewed the basic concept of matching, as well as advances in template matching and applications such as invariant features or novel applications in medical image analysis. Additionally, deformable models and templates originating from classic template matching were discussed. These models have broad applications in image registration, and they are a fundamental aspect of novel machine vision or deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), which perform shift and scale invariant functions followed by classification. In general, although template matching methods have restrictions which limit their application, they are recommended for use with other object recognition methods as pre- or post-processing steps.

INTRODUCTIONIn the majority of object recognition problems in computer vision and image processing, it is often necessary to determine a measure of the similarities between different scenes submitted to the system. Recognition and recognition of objects in images is a central research topic in the computer vision community [4]. A very common approach to detecting objects and determining similarity is template matching. Template matching attempts to answer one of the most basic questions about an image: if there is a specific object in a particular image and where it is found [12]. The template is a description of that object (and is therefore an image itself), and is used to search the image by calculating a measure of difference between the template and any parts of the image that might correspond to the template. If one of these steps produces a small difference, then it is considered a possible occurrence of the object (and is therefore an image itself)."}, {"heading": "II. METHODS AND MATHEMATICS", "text": "Measurements of match and template matching in two- or three-dimensional images require a measure of match between two images that indicates the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between them [4]. The choice of matching algorithm depends on target and template images. In a particular method, template or image matching approaches are categorized into template or area-based approaches and feature-based approaches."}, {"heading": "A. Featured-based Approach", "text": "A feature-based approach is appropriate when both reference and template images show more agreement in terms of characteristics and control points. In this case, features include points, curves or a surface model to perform template matching. In this category, the ultimate goal is to locate the paired connections between the target or so-called reference image and template image based on spatial relationships or characteristics. In this approach, spatial relationships, invariant descriptors, pyramids, wavelengths and relaxation methods play an important role in determining matching metrics."}, {"heading": "B. Area-based Approach", "text": "Area-based methods, usually known as correlation methods or template matching, were first developed by Fonseca et al. [6] and are based on a combined feature detection and feature matching algorithm. This method works very well if the templates do not have strong features with an image, since they operate directly on the pixel values. Matching is measured by the intensity values of the image and template. Matching values are determined by calculating square differences in fixed intensities, correction-based methods, optimization methods and mutual information [10]. In some template matching problems, direct matching between template and target images is impossible. Therefore, the eigenvalue and eigenspaceary Xiv: 161 0.07 231v 1 [cs.C V] 23 oct 201 6 of the given images are used in template matching. These values provide the details required to match the image quadrant, in order to match the image under different lighting conditions, such as contrasting or using a given object under different lighting conditions."}, {"heading": "C. Na\u0131\u0308ve Template Matching", "text": "In this approach, with or without scaling (usually without scaling), the target image is scanned by the template \u2212 \u2212 and similarity measurements are calculated. Finally, however, the positions with the strongest similarities are identified as potential pattern positions. Figure 1 illustrates Lena's famous image. As shown, the sub-images are considered as templates \u2212 and the nave matching method is used to extract the templates and patterns from the target images. As the sub-images originate from the target image without scaling or manipulation, this simple matching algorithm works efficiently. One of the error metrics used to calculate the differences between target and template images is the sum of the square differences 1.SSD = x, y [f, y, y \u2212 u, y \u2212 v]] 2 (1)."}, {"heading": "E. Sequential Similarity Detection Algorithms", "text": "Sequential similarity recognition algorithms (SSDAs) are a more efficient alternative to correlation-based methods, including matching filters for translational registration. Indirectly, the measure of conformity is calculated based on an error for corresponding pixels in f and g in the compared images at each stage of the registration process [4]."}, {"heading": "F. Distortion Measures", "text": "These measures are similar to distortion measures used to evaluate the performance of image compression or image reconstruction techniques. They are also similar to fractal image compression or vector quantization (VQ), since image matching is used to determine fractal mappings and to select the VQ code book. A functional spatial model for deriving a reconstruction filter is optimal if the original and reconstructed images are as similar as possible in terms of a certain degree of similarity [11]."}, {"heading": "G. Dice Coefficient", "text": "Cube Coefficient (DC) is often used in fMRI studies to assess the similarity of two spatial maps. Volume overlap is a simple measure to assess how many of the supra-threshold voxels of two t-maps occur at the same location [14] [7]. Depending on the normalization factor, there are different variants of the overlap metric; the most common is the cube coefficient shown below. DC = 2 \u00d7 | A, B | | A | + | B | (4)"}, {"heading": "H. Efficient Template Matching Methods", "text": "The number of operations required for a given fit method is calculated by the number of operations. However, this calculation does not explain the efficiency of the method in terms of time. Table I demonstrates the computational complexity of the measurements of match for certain algorithms. However, the complexity provided below is defined in terms of the number of operations performed during the computation of the match of metric (i.e. cross-correlation) between two images with R rows and c columns. To compare the methods, we assume that the template f and image g are digitally (digitized) extracted rc images from each position in a search area that has R rows and C columns. Template matching is extracted by an exhaustive search and translation of the template to each (R \u2212 r + 1) (C \u2212 c + 1) position in the image. Next, a measure of match between the template and the sample at the position is calculated."}, {"heading": "III. APPLICATIONS", "text": "Template matching algorithms contribute to various applications, from security-based to biomedical projects. Although the application of this technique is limited due to some limitations in shifting and scaling invariant features, template matching remains a powerful tool for pattern capture in the steps before and after processing image analysis. Fast template matching and some deformable matching algorithms provide fast solutions for object recognition, while the complexity of the algorithms is not very high [1]."}, {"heading": "A. Deformable Template Models", "text": "The initial research in this area focused essentially on rigid shape fitting, where the coordinated shapes were achieved by applying simple transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling and affinity transformation to the model template, which can be restored using correlation-based matching or Hough transformation.The concept of deformable templates was introduced simultaneously in the computer vision of Widrow [17] with rubber masks, and by Fischler and Elschlager [5] with spring-loaded templates. A more powerful technique is malleable template fitting due to its ability to address shape deformations and variations, as shown in Figure 2. Over the past decade, a large volume of deformable template fitting research has been carried out. These activities are divided into two groups. Free-form models represent arbitrary shapes as long as some general regulatory constraints (continuity, smoothness, etc.) are met."}, {"heading": "B. Face Detection", "text": "Facial recognition is a technique used to find an arbitrary sub-image that represents the human face of a given and global image. Traditionally, the way to extract a particular face from a global image is to apply a suitable algorithm to the target image. One of the most important factors in facial recognition is a number of human facial features that play a crucial role in this. In the last ten years, extensive research has been conducted in the field of facial recognition, which has led to the conclusion that the eyes, mouth and nose are the most important features both in facial recognition and in recognition. In addition, human faces have a variety of emotions that are illustrated by many different expressions, and this system can detect the corner of the features in the case of neutral, sad, happy and surprised emotions."}, {"heading": "C. Eye Detection", "text": "Eye detection is a basic requirement for many applications, such as human computer interfaces, iris detection, driver fatigue detection, safety and biology systems. In this paper, the template-based eye detection is described. tem plate correlates with different regions of the face image. The region of the face that provides the maximum correlation with the template is the eye region. It is simple and easy to implement. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated both with eyes open and eyes closed by various simulation results, as shown in Figure 5 [12]."}, {"heading": "D. License Plate Recognition", "text": "An automatic license plate recognition system is a special form of optical character recognition and has been an active research domain in the field of image processing. Although the limitations of template matching have been discussed above, template matching is one of the algorithms that can be used to detect license plates, numbers and letters in a particular region and extract numbers or letters from the detected disk. License plate recognition system is a complex image processing application that detects the signs based on a car license plate based on the given conditions and situations. License plate recognition system is installed in many multi-purpose locations, and even law enforcement agencies use this application to detect speeding vehicles and perform surveillance from a distance. Jalil et al. developed a pipeline to detect and extract the Malaysian license plates used (Figure 6) [23]."}, {"heading": "E. Automatic Bare PCB Board Testing", "text": "A mere printed circuit board is a printed circuit board with no placement of electronic components, and it is used with other components to manufacture electrical instruments at the circuit level. To reduce the manufacturing outlay caused by a defective naked circuit board, the bare circuit board must be checked. Kanimozhi et al. demonstrated how a template matching algorithm is used to verify all connections on a particular circuit board [9]. They proposed a novel hybrid approach to automated circuit board inspection. A model based on the coordinates and connectivity analysis of the circuits was created using some new approaches to edge networking and the fusion of some edge-based and regional algorithms. A modified canny edge detector is used as an edge-based algorithm, while an unattended learning algorithm is used to distinguish between regions on the circuit board."}, {"heading": "F. Normal Breast and Mammogram Positioning", "text": "Sulaiman et al. [18] proposed an expert image processing system based on the matching of templates to locate and determine the symmetrical value between mammograms. They implemented a new matching algorithm for templates using a cross-correlation method. Their 2D cross-correlation algorithm resulted in a high-precision result in the verification process. The resulting image is a two-dimensional expression of equivalence. In the mammogram viewing process shown in Figure 9, it is important to observe the exact orientation of the image. Discrete correlation is a mathematical comparison process in which one image is discreetly compared to another. The resulting image is a two-dimensional expression of equivalence. In the mammogram viewing process, it is important to observe the exact orientation of the image. Generally, a person's breasts are best viewed symmetrical and organ orientation in a symmetrical way."}, {"heading": "G. Brain Network Extraction and Optimization", "text": "Recently, researchers have shown great interest in the use of matrix matrices in medicine, with a particular focus on brain imaging.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, the mathematical foundations of template matching techniques and various matching algorithms were examined. Furthermore, it was shown that a wide range of template matching applications in image processing, computer vision, medical image analysis, and in particular brain imaging should be accompanied by a reclassification or decision step to improve the accuracy of the matching system. We concluded that feature-based matching methods should be used when structural information matches, not intensity information. Furthermore, area-based approaches should be used when they do not have many prominent details and the characteristic information is obvious (color / gray instead of shape / size). Finally, it is worth noting that a given template and the input images must have either statistical dependence or intensity similarities. In the case of intensity similarities, the correlation methods can also be used. From a geometrical point of view, only small amounts of rotation and otherwise publication should not be possible."}], "references": [{"title": "Faster image template matching in the sum of the absolute value of differences measure", "author": ["M.J.

measure between two or more different objects or images. Template matching is a classic and fundamental method used to score similarities between objects using certain mathematical algorithms. In this paper, we reviewed the basic concept of matching, as well as advances in template matching and applications such as invariant features or novel applications in medical image analysis. Additionally, deformable models and templates originating from classic template matching were discussed. These models have broad applications in image registration, and they are a fundamental aspect of novel machine vision or deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), which perform shift and scale invariant functions followed by classification. In general, although template matching methods have restrictions which limit their application, they are recommended for use with other object recognition methods as preor post-processing steps. Combining a template matching technique such as normalized cross-correlation or dice coefficient with a robust decision-making algorithm yields a significant improvement in the accuracy rate for object detection and recognition.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
