Apart from the perceptual signals that we can easily understand, such as audio, video, and natural language, most other time series that are generated are mechanical signals. Therefore, understanding temporal patterns is key to gaining insight and insight. Our ability to store data, however, far exceeds the speed at which we can understand them. Scientists and domain experts expect to discover patterns to help further understand these mechanical signals in various tasks such as classification and anomalous recognition. Learning the (long) temporal correlations that are often embedded in time series remains a major challenge. The visualization of time series provides a new perspective to explore these complex dynamics more intuitively. Many visualization methods have been introduced to address time series tasks. The time frame graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph-h is a challenge."}, {"heading": "2 DATA TRANSFORMATION AND QUANTITATIVE ENCODING", "text": "Time and frequency correlations are important dependencies embedded in time series data. To build a comprehensive but intuitive visualization, the features extracted from the designed data transformation frame should be able to represent the dynamics both in time and frequency, while there is a reverse operation to map the information back to raw time series. In this section we will introduce how to encode the dynamic frequency information in the time order step by step (Figure 1)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Quantization and Markov Matrix", "text": "This framework is similar to [3] for the coding of dynamic transition statistics. We develop this idea by sequentially representing the Markov transition probabilities Q = Q in the temporal dimension in order to obtain information in the temporal dimension. The first step is to quantify time series in order to obtain the first order of the Markov matrix.Given a time series X = {x1, x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, xn}, we must quantify their values in Q containers. \u2212 Quantile is the most common way to achieve a discredited dictionary. By identifying the Q quantile bins, each value series Xiv: 161 0.07 273v 1 [cs.L G] 24 Oct 201 \u2212 6xi is mapped onto each Qi. In [13] a different quantisization approach is proposed, based on the empirical observation that the normalized time series has a Qaussian distribution [11], it is desirable to have a discredisisisisisisisisisisification technique."}, {"heading": "2.2 Markov Transition Field and Network Graph", "text": "The Markov matrix, which contains the Markov dynamics, rejects the conditional relationship between the distribution of X and the temporal dependence on the time steps ti.

PAA is a special case of the moving average model when the skip size corresponds to the length of the sliding window. \u2022 Blur to MTF is achieved by averaging the pixels in each non-overlapping m x m patch with a linear combination of core functions. \u2022 Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) requires that the time series of n dimensions is reduced to w dimensions, and the data is divided into w frames of equal size."}, {"heading": "3 VISUAL ENCODING AND INVERSE MAPPING", "text": "For general inspection, the graph G = (V, E) generated from the MTF has a direct mapping from the vertex V to the time index i in the original time series. It is easy to encode the time index {1,2,..., n} as the color of the vertices. Along the time axis, we select PageRank weights as the vertex and Markov matrix weight as the edge color to observe when (to which vertex) the large flow of information / citations occurs. Modularity is an important pattern in network analysis to identify the specific local structures. To verify the modules and unique patterns, we also determine the modularity designation and cluster coefficient [2, 12] for each vertex and assign them to the original time series."}, {"heading": "4 EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 System Identification", "text": "In order to emphasize the potential of the encoding described above, we first apply it to two time series belonging to different dynamic systems (Figure 1). The first time series is the variable of the chaotic Lorenz equations dt = \u03c3 (\u2212 x + y), which are embedded in a three-dimensional space with coordinates. The trajectory revolves around two unstable fixed points, which then escape into the orbit of the other fixed points.

The ECG dataset is a time series of measurements taken by an electrode during a heartbeat. Cardiologists commented on the data and each dataset is assigned a label for normal or abnormal. The Gun Point dataset contains two-dimensional time series that are taken from the video of two actors aiming either at a weapon or simply at a target. Both dimensions correspond to the X and Y coordinates of the actors on the right. For convenience, we only look at the Y axes. The wafer dataset is recorded by a vacuum chamber sensor during the etching process of silicon wafers for semiconductor manufacturing with normal or abnormal structures."}, {"heading": "4.4 Network Statistics and Summary", "text": "Our encoding network graph not only supports the purpose of visualizing time series, it also bridges visual analysis, network dynamics, and analysis of time series with a natural inverse map from network graph to original time series. Networks can be analyzed by exploring an extensive set of statistical properties of the associated time series with an active visual understanding, while simultaneously visualizing and understanding various dynamic regimes in time series by exploring an extensive set of topological statistics in the associated network domain. Table 2 summarizes some common network statistics for all of our experimental datasets [1]. On the ECG, wafers and gun point datasets capture the average across all samples with specific labels."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we present a novel visualization framework for translating time series into the network graph. Built using the Markov matrix variant called the Markov transition field, the graph is capable of encoding both temporal order and statistical dynamics. Our encoding map also features a natural inversion that allows visual exploration of the interesting patterns in the generated graph and inverse mapping to the original data. Experiments with benchmark and real-time row data demonstrate the effectiveness of our visualization framework in three tasks: system identification, classification and anomaly detection. The inverse mapping is done one-on-one, thereby establishing a link between pattern recognition in the network graph and time series data analysis. Furthermore, our work bridges the gap between visual analysis on time series and network analysis, as the generated network graph can be analyzed to support a comprehensive set of statistical properties associated with further interactive understanding of the network structure."}], "references": [{"title": "Gephi: an open source software for exploring and manipulating networks", "author": ["M.
