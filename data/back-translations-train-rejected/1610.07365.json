Modeling language was supposed to open a window on the brain, or at least give an idea of how things can be processed by the brain. The famous Turing Test (?; ?) itself was not directly about language modeling, but mimicking a conversation through a computer that was considered as a proof of intelligence, i.e. the fact that computers could interpret utterances, infer new information and produce relevant responses.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
