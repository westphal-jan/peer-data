Since the preferences do often not exhibit consistency, a number of inconsistency indices have been defined in order to measure the deviation from this ideal case. Recently, some axioms have been proposed to identify indices that evaluate inconsistency correctly. Inconsistency rankings are weak orders on the set of pairwise comparison matrices with respect to their inconsistency level and can be defined by any inconsistency index. This study characterizes a specific inconsistency ranking by providing six independent axioms such that they determine a unique weak order on the set of all pairwise comparison matrices.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 12:37:36 GMT  (72kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07388v1", "11 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 23 Jan 2017 12:48:49 GMT  (74kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07388v2", "12 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:23:02 GMT  (74kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07388v3", "13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["l\\'aszl\\'o csat\\'o"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07388"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.07388.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Characterization of an inconsistency ranking for pairwise comparison matrices", "authors": ["L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Csat\u00f3"], "emails": ["laszlo.csato@uni-corvinus.hu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Pair-wise comparisons; Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); inconsistency index; axiomatic approach; characterizationJEL Classification number: C44MSC Classes: 90B50, 91B08"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Pairwise comparisons are a fundamental tool in many decision-analysis methods as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty, 1980).
