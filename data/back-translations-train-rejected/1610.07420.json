Generally, the reordering approach analyzes the source sentence (E \") and applies syntactic reordering rules to form reordered sentences (E.\") Training of the SMT system takes place using a parallel corpus, with the source page reordering (E \") and the target page reordering. Source sentences prior to decoding are reordering using the same syntactic rules as those applied to the training data. Thus, this process functions as a preprocessing phase for the phrase-based SMT system. It has been observed that a reordering as a preprocessing phase is beneficial for the development of the English-Hindi phrase-based SMT system (Ra-manathan et al, 2008; Rama et al et al, 2014). This paper describes a rich set of rules for the 2006 De-Hindi structural transformation of the English language structure (using the Hindi sentence)."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "These proposed methods balance the word order differences between the source and target language sentences by reordering the source prior to SMT training and decoding stages. For English-Hindi statistical machine translation, the previous reordering is done by Ramanathan et al. (2008) and Rama et al. (2014). This approach (Ramanathan et al., 2008) has also shown that significant im-ar Xiv: 161 0.07 420v 1 [cs.C L] October 24, 201 6provements over baseline (Brown et al., 1990; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003). With the reordering, the BLEU score for the system has increased from 12.10 to 16.90. The same reordering approach (Ramanathan et al al al al al., 2008) is used by us (with the other test kit), has a slight improvement in the BLEU score from 0.64 above baseline."}, {"heading": "3 Reordering approach", "text": "Our reordering approach is based on a syntactical transformation of the English sentence tree according to the target language (Hindi) structure. It is similar to Ramanathan et al. (2008), but the transformation rules are not limited to SVO to SOV and pre-modifiers to describe only post-modifying transformations.The idea was to find generic syntactic transformation rules that correspond to the target language grammar structure.The motivation stems from the fact that if words are already in the correct place in relation to other words in the sentence, the system does not need to do the additional work of reordering in the decryption time.This problem becomes even more complicated when the system is unable to obtain larger sentences for the translation of a sentence. If the system is able to obtain only 2-word length sentences, there are 362880 (9!) translations (permutations) that are possible."}, {"heading": "3.1 Noun Phrase Rules", "text": "ndU ntarP (np2 the) P (np2 the time) (np2 the time) (np2 the time) (np3 the time) (np3 the time) (np3 the time) (np3 the time) (np3 the time) (np3 the time) (np3 the time) (sbar when nature sees all its splendor) is beautiful.
