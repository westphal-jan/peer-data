One particular stand out success relates to unsupervised learning from a massive amount of data, albeit much of it relates to one modality/type of data at a time. In spite of early assertions of the unreasonable effectiveness of data, there is increasing recognition of utilizing knowledge whenever it is available or can be created purposefully. In this paper, we focus on discussing the indispensable role of knowledge for deeper understanding of complex text and multimodal data in situations where (i) large amounts of training data (labeled/unlabeled) are not available or labor intensive to create, (ii) the objects (particularly text) to be recognized are complex (i.e., beyond simple entity-person/location/organization names), such as implicit entities and highly subjective content, and (iii) applications need to use complementary or related data in multiple modalities/media. What brings us to the cusp of rapid progress is our ability to (a) create knowledge, varying from comprehensive or cross domain to domain or application specific, and (b) carefully exploit the knowledge to further empower or extend the applications of ML/NLP techniques. Using the early results in several diverse situations - both in data types and applications - we seek to foretell unprecedented progress in our ability for deeper understanding and exploitation of multimodal data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 02:13:53 GMT  (1114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07708v1", "15 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["amit sheth", "sujan perera", "sanjaya wijeratne"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07708"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.07708.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Knowledge will Propel Machine Understanding of Content: Extrapolating from Current Examples", "authors": ["Amit Sheth", "Sujan Perera", "Sanjaya Wijeratne"], "emails": ["amit@knoesis.org", "sujan@knoesis.org", "sanjaya@knoesis.org"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: semantic analysis of multimodal data, knowledge-based computing, machine intelligence, multimodal utilization, understanding of complex texts, knowledge-based ML and NLP, knowledge-based understanding of deep content, semantic search, domain-specific information retrieval, ontology, knowledge databases, background knowledge, EmojiNet, Emoji Sense Disambiguation, knowledge-based search, improvement of statistical models with knowledge, implicit linkage of entities"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In recent years, the number of those who are able to communicate in the world has increased enormously, both in the world and in the world.

While applications such as search, browsing and questions have been able to use these knowledge bases in their current forms, others such as film recommendations, biomedical knowledge bases and clinical data interpretation are challenged by the limitations of current knowledge bases: these limitations are threefold: 1. Measurement of knowledge bases, 2. Imperfection and inadequacy of knowledge bases, and 3. Limitations in the knowledge base: Rapid growth in knowledge bases occurs in terms of both numbers and size. This growth challenges the proper organization of knowledge bases on the Web, which increasingly leads users of knowledge bases to find relevant knowledge bases, relevant knowledge bases and relevant knowledge databases."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusions and looking forward", "text": "We have discussed the importance of domain / world knowledge in understanding complex data in the real world, especially when large amounts of training data are not readily available or expensive to generate. We have shown (and pointed to three additional applications) two use cases in which knowledge plays an indispensable role in understanding complex language constructs and multimodal data. We also see early efforts to make knowledge bases dynamic and evolve to accommodate changes in the real world. [33] Knowledge seems to play a central role in human learning and intelligence, such as learning from small amounts of data or cognition - especially in perception. Our ability to generate or use just the right knowledge in our computing processes will improve machine intelligence, perhaps in the same way that knowledge plays a central role in human intelligence."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We acknowledge the partial support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Award: CNS-1513721: \"Context-Aware Harassment Detection on Social Media,\" National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Grant No. 5R01DA039454-02: \"Trending: Social Media Analysis to Monitor Cannabis and Synthetic Cannabinoid Use,\" National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award: MH105384-01A1: \"Modeling Social Behavior for Healthcare Utilization in Depression,\" and Grant No. 2014 - PS-PSN-00006: awarded by the Bureau of Justice Assistance.

success story during the AI resurgence. One particular stand out success relates to unsupervised learning from a massive amount of data, albeit much of it relates to one modality/type of data at a time. In spite of early assertions of the unreasonable effectiveness of data, there is increasing recognition of utilizing knowledge whenever it is available or can be created purposefully. In this paper, we focus on discussing the indispensable role of knowledge for deeper understanding of complex text and multimodal data in situations where (i) large amounts of training data (labeled/unlabeled) are not available or labour intensive to create, (ii) the objects (particularly text) to be recognized are complex (i.e., beyond simple entity \u2013 person/location/organization names), such as implicit entities and highly subjective content, and (iii) applications need to use complementary or related data in multiple modalities/media. What brings us to the cusp of rapid progress is our ability to (a) create knowledge, varying from comprehensive or cross domain to domain or application specific, and (b) carefully exploit the knowledge to further empower or extend the applications of ML/NLP techniques. Using the early results in several diverse situations \u2013 both in data types and applications \u2013 we seek to foretell unprecedented progress in our ability for deeper understanding and exploitation of multimodal data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
