[5] After standardization, emoji use experienced strong growth in 2011, when the Apple iPhone added an emoji keyboard to iOS, and again in 2013, when the mobile platform began to support emoji. [8] In an experiment involving 1.6 million tweets, Nowak and co. reported that 4% of them contained at least one emoji [11]. Their recent popularity explains why research on their use is not as extensive as research on emoji characters, which are emoji's predecessor [11], used to represent facial expressions, emotions, or mimic nonverbal links in verbal language [13]. Early research on emoji focuses on its role in computer-assisted text communication."}, {"heading": "3 Building EmojiNet", "text": "We define EmojiNet formally as a collection of octuples that represent the senses of an emoji network.

The current version of EmojiNet supports searching for emojis based on Unicode characters and short code names. In addition, the user can search emojis by specifying part of the tagged meaning and returns a list of emojis marked with the meaning searched for. Table 2 lists statistics for EmojiNet. It currently contains a total of 1,074 emojis. It has a total of 3,206 valid meaning definitions shared among 875 emojis, with an average of 4 senses per emoji.

Note that we do not evaluate EmojiNet's usability based on a selected task or benchmark dataset. While sense inventories such as BabelNet have been evaluated based on benchmark WSD datasets or word-similarity calculations, emoji sense disambiguization and finding emoji similarities are two separate research issues that have not yet been explored [8]. The focus of this work is not on investigating or solving these issues."}, {"heading": "4.1 Evaluating Image Processing Algorithm", "text": "Next, we evaluate how well the closest image processing algorithm matches each image in it with the images in Ix. Ix could contain multiple images for a particular emoji (7 images per emoji on average), based on different rendering platforms on which the emoji could appear. The set of all the different images Ii belonging to an egg is labeled with the Unicode representation of egg. For us, to find a match between it and Ix, we only need one of the multiple images that an emoji from Ix represents with any image from it. Once the matching process is complete, we select the top ranking match based on the dissimilarity of the two customized images and rate them manually for equality. During the image processing algorithm we use, it works well in our use case."}, {"heading": "4.2 Evaluating Word Sense Disambiguation Algorithm", "text": "Here we discuss how we use the most common sense-based and popular sense-based word monsters we have used to link emoji senses to BabelNet senses. We use a manual assessment approach based on human judges to validate whether an emoji sensation is valid in an emoji sensation. We sought the help of two human judges in this task and our judges, who have either formed a class for natural language processing, and we provided them with all the emoji sensations extracted from the emoji label."}, {"heading": "4.3 EmojiNet at Work", "text": "The tweets we are looking at are: T1: Pray for my family, God has won an angel today. T2: Difficult to win, but we have it man Lets celebrate! EmojiNet lists high five (noun) and prays (verb) as valid senses for the above emoji. For high five (noun), EmojiNet lists three definitions, and for prayer (verb) it lists two definitions. We include all words that appear in their respective definitions as possible contextual words that can occur when the appropriate sense is used in a sentence (tweet in this case). For each sense, EmojiNet extracts the following sentences of words: Prayer, Thanksgiving, Saints, Higher Gods that we have exaggerated."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "This paper outlined the construction of EmojiNet, the first machine-readable sensory inventory to understand the meaning of emoji. It integrates four different emoji resources from the web to extract emoji senses and align those senses with BabelNet. We evaluated the automatic creation of EmojiNet by evaluating (i) the closest neighborhood-based image processing algorithm used to align various emoji senses from the web with BabelNet. We plan to expand our work in the future by expanding the meaning definitions extracted from BabelNet to include words extracted from tweets that are most common and popular meaning-based word disambiguation algorithms used to align various emoji senses extracted from the web. We also plan to expand our work in the future by adding words extracted from BabelNet to include words extracted from tweets, using a word-embedding model trained on tweets that contain emoji. We also plan to evaluate the usefulness of EmojiNet by first evaluating emoji-based, and then evaluating emoji-based emotions from emoji-net."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Sujan Perera for the thought-provoking discussions on this topic.
