A standard approach that the medical community has devised to manage widely prevalent chronic diseases such as chronic heart failure (CHF) is to have a committee of experts develop guidelines that all physicians should follow. These guidelines typically consist of a series of complex rules that make recommendations based on a patient's information. Due to their complexity, often the guidelines are either ignored or not complied with at all, which can result in poor medical practices. It is not even clear whether it is humanly possible to follow these guidelines due to their length and complexity. In the case of CHF management, the guidelines run nearly 80 pages. In this paper we describe a physician-advisory system for CHF management that codes the entire set of clinical practice guidelines for CHF using answer set programming. Our approach is based on developing reasoning templates (that we call knowledge patterns) and using these patterns to systemically code the clinical guidelines for CHF as ASP rules. Use of the knowledge patterns greatly facilitates the development of our system. Given a patient's medical information, our system generates a recommendation for treatment just as a human physician would, using the guidelines. Our system will work even in the presence of incomplete information. Our work makes two contributions: (i) it shows that highly complex guidelines can be successfully coded as ASP rules, and (ii) it develops a series of knowledge patterns that facilitate the coding of knowledge expressed in a natural language and that can be used for other application domains.

The system automates the rules set out in the ACCF / AHA guide for managing heart failure. It is able to take a patient's data as input and produce treatment recommendations that strictly adhere to the guidelines. It can also be used by a physician to derive symptoms and other conditions that need to be met by a given treatment recommendation. Our approach to developing the system is based on identifying knowledge patterns and using them as building blocks for constructing the ASP code. There are many ways to further expand the work we want to pursue in the future: \u2022 Expansion of the system for comorbidities: We want our system to deal with comorbidities of heart failure (Jantos and Holmes 2006).
