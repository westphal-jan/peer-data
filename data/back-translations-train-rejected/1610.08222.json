The problem is NP difficult, making it unpredictable in polynomial time [15]. The problem is to find the shortest possible route through a set of n cities / nodes, so that each city / node is visited exactly once. A weighted graph G (N, E) can represent a TSP, where N represents the cities and E represents the set of edges connecting cities. For each (i, j) there is a certain distance d. If d (i, j) = d (j, i), it is known as a symmetric TSP, where in an asymmetric TSP d (i, j) 6 = d (j, i) can occur. In our study we only consider the symmetric situation."}, {"heading": "2.2 Ant Colony Systems (ACS)", "text": "There are many ant species, some of which are blind.

When foraging, ants place the chemical; pheromone on the ground and follow the pheromone placed by other ants. The pheromones tend to decay over time. The ant colony system is an example of an ant colony optimization method in the field of swarm intelligence, meta-heuristics and computational intelligence.

Biological studies show many interesting lifestyle factors for fireflies [14]. The fireflies algorithm was developed in 2009 by Xin-She-Yang [18]. The algorithm is essentially based on the following: \u2022 The attractiveness of fireflies to each other is gender-independent. \u2022 Attractiveness is proportional to the brightness of fireflies, with the less bright attracting to the lighter one (and thus moving towards the lighter one). \u2212 However, brightness may decrease with distance; if there is no brighter than one particular fireflies, it moves randomly. \u2022 The brightness of a fireflies is determined by the value of the specific target function. \u2212 How many meta-heuristics, so the initial problem is generated for each population."}, {"heading": "3 Self-tuning firefly algorithm optimizing Ant colony", "text": "This year, there will be no significant change in the first half of the year."}, {"heading": "4 Experimentation", "text": "The aim of this experiment is to analyze the performance of the ACSFA algorithm, which solves symmetrical TSPs, while selecting the most appropriate parameter values for ACS and FA.

The parameters of ACS include: \u03b2, \u03b1, \u03c1, q0, m, \u03c40 and \u03c4. \u03c40 is based on the nearest heuristician. The pheromone density \u03c4 depends on \u03b1 and \u03c1 parameters. Since \u03b1 only works with the world's best value, we initialize \u03b1 to 0.1. Here, we consider \u03b2, \u03c1 and q0 to be coordinated by the self-tuned firefly algorithm. The range for these parameters is \u03b2 [0 8], \u03c1 [0.5 1] and q0 \u0432 [0.5 1], which are large enough to select the best parameter values for many symmetrical TSP instances. Apart from that, we coordinate the parameters of the ACFF algorithms.

Results are formatted as the best TSP distance, the average, the worst and the average time required by each algorithm. The results obtained illustrate the strength of ACSFA over the other two algorithms. Interestingly, the results are better in ACSFA and most parameters are handled by the self-tuning firefly algorithm. However, in order to conveniently prove the results, a statistical analysis of the results obtained is also performed."}, {"heading": "5.1 Statistical Analysis", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this project is a project which is, first and foremost, a project of the European Union."}, {"heading": "5.2 Parameter Optimization", "text": "The statistical study emphasizes that there is no significant difference between ACSFA and PSOACS. However, ACSFA is better because it provides the user with a parameter-free environment. The Firefly Algorithm with the Self-Tuning Framework adjusts the necessary parameters of ACS and FA. Figure 4 shows the evolution of the parameter values of ACS over the iterations for the eil51 TSP instance. Here, the mean value of each parameter is calculated for each iteration.It is also necessary to see the behavior of the parameters of FA. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the parameters of FA during iterations for the eil51 TSP instance. Again, the mean value of each parameter is calculated for each iteration.Figures 4 and 5 indicate that the parameter values vary up to a certain number of iterations and then stabilize over an optimal value."}, {"heading": "6 Concluding Remarks", "text": "The study focused on the implementation of an ant colony algorithm to solve symmetrical TSP problems, the parameters of which are handled by a self-tuned firefly algorithm, which has been successfully implemented and tested with standard TSP problems, and the results achieved draw some important conclusions. In terms of optimization, the results show that ACSFA performs well in finding the shortest route for a given TSP instance. Comparisons with ACS and PSOACS show that ACSFA works well. Although statistical analysis concludes that both ACSFA and PSOACS perform equally well, ACSFA outperforms PSOACS by providing a parameter-free environment. The self-tuning framework worked well with the firefly algorithm in matching both ACS and FA parameters. Graphrasing the evolution of ACFA parameters and clearly demonstrating the ability of the self-tuning algorithm to perform."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The authors would like to thank Dr. Xin-She Yang for his valuable suggestions and explanations on the implementation of the self-tuning framework and Ms. W.J.
