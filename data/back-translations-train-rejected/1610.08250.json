It is a well-known fact that around one million people suffer from Parkinson's disease in the United States whereas the number of people suffering from Parkinson's disease worldwide is around 5 million. Thus, it is important to predict Parkinson's disease in early stages so that early plan for the necessary treatment can be made. People are mostly familiar with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, however, an increasing amount of research is being done to predict the Parkinson's disease from non-motor symptoms that precede the motor ones. If an early and reliable prediction is possible then a patient can get a proper treatment at the right time. Nonmotor symptoms considered are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and olfactory loss. Developing machine learning models that can help us in predicting the disease can play a vital role in early prediction. In this paper, we extend a work which used the non-motor features such as RBD and olfactory loss. Along with this the extended work also uses important biomarkers. In this paper, we try to model this classifier using different machine learning models that have not been used before. We developed automated diagnostic models using Multilayer Perceptron, BayesNet, Random Forest and Boosted Logistic Regression. It has been observed that Boosted Logistic Regression provides the best performance with an impressive accuracy of 97.159 % and the area under the ROC curve was 98.9%. Thus, it is concluded that these models can be used for early prediction of Parkinson's disease.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 09:34:39 GMT  (124kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08250v1", "Conference Paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Conference Paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["kamal nayan reddy challa", "venkata sasank pagolu", "ganapati panda", "babita majhi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.08250"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.08250.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Improved Approach for Prediction of Parkinson\u2019s Disease using Machine Learning Techniques", "authors": ["Kamal Nayan Reddy Challa", "Venkata Sasank Pagolu", "Babita Majhi"], "emails": ["kc11@iitbbs.ac.in", "vp12@iitbbs.ac.in", "gpanda@iitbbs.ac.in", "babita.majhi@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED RESEARCH WORK", "text": "Indira et al. [4] used the human biomedical voice as the main feature, and the authors developed a model to automatically predict whether a person has PD by analyzing the patient's voice, using fuzzy c-mean (FCM) cluster and pattern recognition methods on the dataset and achieving an accuracy of 68.04%, 75.34% sensitivity and 45.83% specificity. Amit et al. [5] presented a unique approach to classifying PD patients based on their postural instability and used an L2 standard metric in conjunction with a support machine. In [6], the authors used a 40 item smell test (UPSIT-40) and a 16 item identification test of sniffins sticks. This study was conducted on the Brazilian population, and the authors applied logistical regression taking into account each of the above features separately, and 83.5% observed that 83.5% of the respondents had a specific characteristic."}, {"heading": "III. MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "A flowchart of the proposed analysis is shown in Fig. 1. Data was first collected and then the required non-motor and biomarker characteristics extracted. Subsequently, various machine learning algorithms are used for the classification task. Finally, a comparative analysis based on the accuracy provided by different machine learning models is performed."}, {"heading": "A. Database", "text": "In this study, data were collected from the database of the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) [8]. PPMI is an observational, multicenter study that collects clinical and imaging data and biological samples from various cohorts that can be used by researchers to determine markers of disease progression in PD. PPMI has established a comprehensive, standardized, longitudinal PD data and biological sampling stores that can play a critical role in the development of tools that help predict PD. To get the latest information, visit the official website of PPMI (www.ppmi-info.org), which is similar to the one in [3]. We downloaded the database on August 8, 2016, when data from 184 normal patients and 402 early PD subjects were collected. It is noted that PPMI has observations from each of the patients at different time intervals."}, {"heading": "B. Feature Description", "text": "1) University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT): olfactory dysfunction is an important marker of Parkinson's disease [9]. It acts as a more sensitive and early marker of Parkinson's disease. It is a fact that most people who suffer from PD have olfactory loss, but it does not mean that all people with olfactory loss suffer from PD [10]. olfactory dysfunction is present in various forms, for example, it may be an impairment of odor recognition or odor differentiation. A study by Posen et al [11] showed that about 10% of subjects who suffered from olfactory dysfunction were at risk of PD. To quantify this loss of odor, the data from the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test are used. This test is commercially available and is also one of the most reliable tests [12]. The method of the test is as follows: A subject receives four different pages of this 10-page scent test."}, {"heading": "2) REM sleep Behaviour Disorder Screening Questionnaire", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "C. Prediction models for distinguishing early PD and healthy normal subjects", "text": "In this study, four different types of machine learning are selected for classification tasks. A brief description of each of them is provided in this section. WEKA [20] is used for classification with Multilayer Perceptron, Bayesian Network, Random Forward, and Boosted Logistic Regression. It is the main motive to find an algorithm that can improve the accuracy already reported, as well as to see how different models are performed. First, the dataset is standardized in WEKA using the Normalize Filter. Then, the dataset is divided in a way that 70% will be used for training and the rest, 30% will be used for testing. While partitioning the dataset will maintain the same class proportions in both the test and move data, if the proportion of healthy people in the complete data is maintained at 40% then both in training and in testing the percentage of healthy people in PD subjects. This type of partitioning is known as stratified partitioning."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Table 1 shows the performance of various classifiers used in the study. Figure 2 shows the corresponding ROC diagrams. In Multilayer Perceptron, the backward propagation algorithm is used to train the model; the learning rate is set to 0.4 and the number of hidden layers chosen in this case is 8 (number of attributes + number of classes); in BayesNet, various search algorithms and quality yardsticks are used; to estimate the conditional probability tables of a Bayes network after learning the structure, a Simple Estimator is chosen; in the search for the K2 algorithm, an algorithm limited by a sequence of variables is used; in the increased logistic regression, Adaboost M1 is used to boost logistic regression; however, it is observed that all classifiers work reasonably well with increased logistic regression, with the best performance being achieved with 97.16% accuracy and 8.9% ROC (AUC) below the range."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is not straightforward, which means that a particular test, such as a blood test or an ECG, cannot determine whether a person has PD or not. Physicians go through a patient's medical history followed by a thorough neurological examination. They find at least two cardinal symptoms in the subjects and then predict whether or not the subject has PD. The misdiagnosis rate of PD is significant due to a non-definitive test. In such a case, it will be helpful for us to help the physician by providing a machine learning model. Prediction models are developed using machine learning techniques of increased logistic regression, classification trees, Bayes Net and multi-layered perceptrons based on these significant features. It is observed that performance is better. It is shown that increased logistic regression produces superior outcomes. These results encourage us to try other ensemble learning techniques based on these learning algorithms, which are used in different learning machines."}], "references": [{"title": "Epidemiology of Parkinson\u2019s disease", "author": ["G Alves", "EB Forsaa", "KF Pedersen", "M Dreetz Gjerstad", "JP Larsen"], "venue": "J Neurol 255 Suppl", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Progression of Motor and Non- Motor Features of Parkinson\u2019s Disease and Their Response to Treatment", "author": ["TC Vu", "JG Nutt", "NH Holford"], "venue": "Br J Clin Pharmacol", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease using Fuzzy C-Means Clustering and Pattern Recognition", "author": ["Rustempasic", "Indira", "M.
