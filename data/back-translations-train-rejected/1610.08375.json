In this single survey, papers from over 30 different publication sites are presented, from computational linguistics to data mining, artificial intelligence and medical informatics. The added value of this survey is that it collects all relevant literature and discusses it in an informative way. Furthermore, instructions for future work are proposed. Consequently, this survey is aimed at all researchers and practitioners of natural language generation who want to start or resume working on content selection, and since it contains an informative introduction, it can be useful for students and researchers who are new to the field, as well as for experienced researchers who want to deal with the latest developments. The next section describes the motivation to deal with the task of content selection from time series data (Section 2)."}, {"heading": "2 Motivation", "text": "This section highlights the importance of content selection in data-to-text systems. In particular, it will answer: (1) why it is important for data-to-text systems to determine the relevant content (Section 2.1); (2) why it is preferable to present text summaries of time series data rather than graphics (Section 2.2); and (3) why it is important for content selection to be adaptable (Section 2.3)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Achieving the Communicative Goal", "text": "Data-to-text systems are useful to simplify the presentation of complex data. Overloading of time series data available via the web, sensors and other means has increased the need to process this data in an automatic, precise and time-saving manner. NLG systems can meet this challenge in an automatic and fast way, for example, an NLG system can read sensor data and create a comprehensive textual summary. Previous research on generating data from time series has been carried out in various areas, such as weather forecasts (Sripada et al., 2004; Konstas et Lapata, 2012; Gkatzia et al., 2016a), health informatics (Gatt et al., 2009; Gkatzia et al., 2016b), stock exchanges (Kukich et al., 1983) and passive technology systems (Black et al., 2010). These systems use different methods to select content reviewed in sections 4 and 5."}, {"heading": "2.2 Effectiveness of Textual Summaries over Graphical Representations", "text": "Data, and in particular time series data, are usually presented using visualization techniques that are difficult for an inexperienced user to understand. Data-to-text systems face the challenge of communicating the data in a simpler, more effective, and more comprehensible way by communicating information through language. Recent studies have shown that text descriptions of data can be more effective, comprehensible, and helpful in decision-making than the corresponding graphics (van den Meulen et al., 2010; Law et al., 2005), even when the data is uncertain (Gkatzia et al., 2016a). Early research has shown that graphics require expertise to be interpreted (Petre, 1995). More recently, graphic summaries of texts with the corresponding sample graphs in terms of their effectiveness in supporting clinical decisions are presented in this study."}, {"heading": "2.3 Adaptive Output", "text": "Different user groups such as doctors, nurses and parents or lecturers and students therefore have different information needs and preferences, so personalised reports are important. Hunter et al. (2011) emphasise that personalisation should be based on relevant factors / variables such as user stress levels and not just on demographic data, although demographic data can in some cases be important for adaptation. Users have different preferences and objectives, and systems should adapt to these in order to be more preferred. DiMarco et al. (2008) emphasise that it is necessary for a system not to refer to events that appear irrelevant to the majority of users but are relevant to a particular user. For example, today's healthcare systems may provide patients with too much irrelevant information or leave out important information, leading users to believe that the system is not addressed to them (DiMarco et al., 2008), which can have negative effects on adherence to medical procedures."}, {"heading": "3 Challenges for Content Selection in Data-to-text Systems", "text": "\u2022 Data Availability: The lack of aligned data sets (data and related summaries) that can be used to derive rules or to form an NLG system is a major challenge for NLG engineers. Although the data is widely available, it cannot be used directly to develop an NLG system, as there is a lack of alignment between input and output data (Belz and Kow)."}, {"heading": "4 Rule-based Content Selection in Data-to-Text Systems", "text": "It is the time in which people in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA,"}, {"heading": "5 Trainable Approaches to Content Selection", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of us are able to play by the rules they have imposed on ourselves.

Evaluation can be either intrinsic (e.g. automatic metrics and user ratings) or extrinsic (e.g. evaluation with users in terms of the success of the task), but extrinsic evaluation is more important to define what an application is good for and to determine whether an application meets its task requirements. Next, we review some forms of evaluation, highlighting how successful they are in assessing the relevance of the work mentioned above. Evaluation methods are divided into intrinsic and ex-trinsic methods, using the terminology of Belz and Hastie (2014)."}, {"heading": "7.1 Intrinsic methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7.1.1 Output Quality Measures", "text": "It is a type of intrinsic evaluation that assesses the similarity of the results to a reference model or evaluates quality criteria (Belz and Hastie, 2014), such as the translation metrics BLEU, NIST, ROUGE, F-measure, etc. \u2022 BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) was first introduced into machine translation to assess the output quality of machine translated text by comparing it with a human reference translation, so that \"the closer a machine translation comes to a professional human translation, the better it is\" (Papineni et al., 2002); it has been widely used to evaluate data-to-text systems to measure the proximity of a machine-generated text, e.g. (Angeli et al., 2010)."}, {"heading": "7.1.2 User-like Measures", "text": "This method is used in (Walker et al., 2002) and (Foster et al., 2007), where an adaptive system is compared with a non-adaptive one. The advantage of this method is that, unlike extrinsic methods, which normally require a carefully designed setup, it can be carried out very quickly and easily."}, {"heading": "7.2 Extrinsic Evaluation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7.2.1 User Task Success Measures", "text": "Such an assessment is used in BabyTalk (Gatt et al., 2009), where users are shown two outputs and have to make a decision to measure which outputs are more efficient and helpful for decision-making. Gkatzia et al. (2015) present a game-based setup for evaluating data-text systems that measures decision-making."}, {"heading": "7.2.2 System Purpose Success Measures", "text": "Such an assessment is applied to the STOP system (Reiter et al., 1999) to determine whether the purpose of the system has been achieved, i.e. whether users quit smoking. Although measuring the success of the system's purpose is extremely important, it is an expensive and time-consuming task. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the system is exclusively successful or whether external factors influence the outcome. If we look at the STOP project, there is uncertainty as to whether someone has quit smoking due to the letter produced or due to other circumstances (e.g. health problems). Extrinsic methods are more effective when it comes to whether a data-to-text system will be successful or whether users will get an \"added value.\" Due to the complexity of these assessment approaches, evaluators should be very careful when assessing the success of the measurement tasks and the experiments for the system's purpose, and should try to limit the impact of the past decade."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "This article presents the two main approaches to content selection for data generation: rules-based approaches and traceable approaches; content selection has been introduced in other areas; and adaptive NLG systems have been reviewed; and finally, valuation metrics and their suitability have been discussed; both rule-based and traceable approaches offer advantages and suffer from limitations as discussed in the following paragraphs and as presented in Table 4; in terms of content selection, rules-based systems based on craft rules are becoming more robust and widely used in industry; and the output produced by rules-based systems is more understandable to people as it is fully controlled; these systems can also take outliers into account as long as rules are provided to handle extreme data examples; however, they are unable to cover all the different rules as the number of rules analogous to the complexity of the domain increases."}, {"heading": "8.1 How to choose an approach for a particular domain and application?", "text": "Explaining the assumptions and assertions of researchers as to why they believe that an approach may (or may not) be suitable for content selection enables us to look at the task spherically and identify appropriate and inappropriate approaches. In this process, the following framework is intended to provide NLG researchers and developers with a number of key questions: \u2022 Domain: Is it a large or a small domain? \u2022 Knowledge (either from data or experts): If it is a large domain, is a coordinated data set available? If so, in what format is the data available? If not, can you simply crowd-source data? If it is a small domain, do you have access to expert knowledge? \u2022 Assessment: What is the main purpose of the system? Can you design an assessment that involves potential users? A good understanding of the task (domain, available knowledge and evaluation) greatly contributes to which approaches to use and how to evaluate it."}, {"heading": "9 Recommendations for Future Directions", "text": "There are several open research questions on data-text systems that can either be specific to content selection or can be explored together with surface realization. \u2022 How can approaches be transferred between domains or from one language to another? One possible direction may be the application of transfer learning approaches (Jialin Pan and Yang, 2010). \u2022 How can text information be better combined with visual information to achieve better success in the task and the system purpose? There is evidence that multimodal systems that combine graphs with language are more effective in decision-making than systems that use only graphs or only natural language (Gkatzia et al., 2016a). However, little is known about what kind of data can be better communicated multimodally or as texts. \u2022 Can we develop approaches that deal with uncertain data? A large variety of data is uncertain, either due to its nature (e.g. stock exchange data or weather data) or due to its source (e.g. data from the web)."}, {"heading": "A Available Datasets", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Data-to-text systems are powerful in generating reports from data automatically and thus they simplify the presentation of complex data.
