INTRODUCTION", "text": "Often seen as a social construct, food has become an integral part of modern life. New jargon has entered our vocabulary as terms such as \"foodie,\" \"food porn\" or \"food tourism,\" but points to the trappings that come from our culinary experiences. With the rise of social media and the spread of always-on-always-connected devices, this convoluted revolution is not limited to our kitchens, restaurants and food stalls, but is naturally breaking out of the social network. Food sharing has become a growing passion for tourists and locals [16], and dedicated food search for apps, along with the ubiquitous social presence of celebrity chefs, have all contributed to a thriving culture and passion for food worldwide."}, {"heading": "2. DATASETS", "text": "Our study is based on a set of data sets, namely a large number of recipes collected at Yummly, an ingredient list compiled by BBC Food, and health statistics for each country. In this section we describe these data sets in detail."}, {"heading": "2.1 Yummly data", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves, and they will be able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "2.2 BBC Food Data", "text": "BBC Food3 is a part of the BBC website, which provides information about recipes, ingredients, cooks, kitchens and other information related to cooking and dishes from all BBC programmes. In the summer of 2016, we searched through all the ingredients on the BBC Food website and collected about 1,000 ingredients which we used to organise and standardise the ingredients in the Yummly dataset. The standardisation process is as follows: (i) We extracted all 11,000 ingredients from the Yummly dataset and performed a preliminary data purification, i.e. we removed units (mass, volume, etc.), numbers, punctuation marks and other symbols. (ii) Due to the multilingualism of the Yummly data, we used the Google Translate API to perform automatic voice recognition and translation of all Yummly ingredients into English. (iii) We used the BBC Ingredients list as a reference and mapped all possible ingredients from the Yummly list on it (iv) as all the ingredients were not successfully placed in this group of 3,000."}, {"heading": "2.3 Country health statistics", "text": "Since diet is directly related to individual health, we will also link Yummly statistics to real health data. To this end, at 3http: / / www.bbc.co.uk / food / we will use estimates of diabetes prevalence from The World Development Indicators by The World Bank4, health expenditure as a percentage of the World Bank's total GDP 5, and the prevalence of obesity by the World Health Organization 6 in the countries for which kitchens are mapped, using the latest available data from 2014."}, {"heading": "3. INGREDIENTS AROUND THE WORLD", "text": "In this section, we describe the ingredients used in dishes from around the world. First, we examine the diversity of ingredients in different countries. Next, we define the concept of the \"complexity\" of a dish by its ingredients and look at how the complexity is changing worldwide. Finally, we discuss a series of case studies on the most notable and significant ingredients in some outstanding cuisines."}, {"heading": "3.1 Diversity of ingredients", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive on their own are able to survive on their own. \"The answer to this question is what we call global diversification: the variety of ingredients that we have in a country where people are able to survive on their own, and the variety of ingredients that we are able to survive on our own."}, {"heading": "3.2 Complexity of dishes", "text": "Another interesting concept about the culinary preferences of different countries is the complexity of the dishes. The complexity of a dish is simply the number of unique ingredients required to prepare it. Accordingly, one kitchen is more complex than another if its dishes are proportionally more complex than another. Formally, each kitchen is associated with the complexity distribution of its dishes. For an example kitchen, this distribution, namely P (X = i), indicates the probability that a dish from this kitchen has exactly i unique ingredients. Thus, the cumulative complexity distribution (CCD) gives us an insight into the complexity of the dishes in a particular kitchen. Figure 3 shows the cumulative complexity distribution (CCD) for Norwegian, Russian, Spanish, Tunisian and Laoan ingredients. From the illustration, we can see that the CCD for Norwegian cuisine is slower than the others."}, {"heading": "3.3 Notable ingredients", "text": "In this section, we examine the most notable ingredients associated with some well-known kitchens using our recipe data set from Yummly.We use the term frequency - inverse document frequency (TFIDF) to find notable ingredients in each kitchen. In this way, each ingredient is considered an atomic word, and the collection of all ingredients that have appeared within a kitchen is considered a document. A TF-IDF calculation leads us to find the weight of different ingredients in the body of documents. In this way, the meaning of each ingredient is specified within each kitchen.Figure 5 shows the 50 most noteworthy ingredients for Italian, Indian and Mexican kitchens as a case study. We have also looked at other similar cases that we do not present here due to spatial limitations. For the greater number of search results in the Google kitchen, the term moundness is the most common. \""}, {"heading": "4.

As we mentioned in Section 2.1, each recipe contains the flavors for six different flavors, including saltiness, acidity, sweetness, bitterness, palatability, and pungency. To calculate the similarity between the cuisines based on these flavors, we consider each cuisine as a distribution across different flavors. In terms of the fact that different flavors of a recipe are related, a dish can hardly be both sweet and spicy at the same time - and, based on the continuity of the flavors we relate to each other, hypothetically."}, {"heading": "5.

NUTRITION VALUES", "text": "In this section, we examine the relationship between the nutritional values of recipes related to countries and their hard measures of health, including obesity rate, diabetes rate and health expenditure. Since the recipes are categorized by their cuisine, but the health measures of countries are reported, we must assign each diabetes disease to one or more countries beforehand. To this end, we assign each cuisine to the countries that geographically or semantically encompass this cuisine. For example, we have assigned Kurdish cuisine to the countries: Iran, Iraq and Turkey, because the Kurdistan region is divided between these countries. As another example, we have mapped Italian-American cuisine both in Italy and in the USA, because the cuisine represents both Italian and American food culture. In this way, we consider the recipes of each country as all the recipes of the cuisines that belong to this country.For each country, we calculate the average calorie, fat, carbohydrates and sugar values via its recipes."}, {"heading": "7. RELATED WORK", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do and what they want to do."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSION", "text": "This work presented a large-scale study of user-generated recipes on the Internet, their ingredients, nutrition, similarities between countries and their relationship to the health statistics of each country. Our results have several implications: We found strong similarities between cuisines in neighboring countries, but the variety of ingredients and flavors varies between continents, which are largely influenced by net migration trends. They may be a clich\u00e9 about what you eat, but we found quantitative evidence of a strong correlation between nutritional information in recipes (for example, in terms of sugar consumption) and obesity. We also showed that deep learning can be used to effectively predict cuisine from ingredients and potentially enable fine-grained analysis of foods and dishes as well as improved recipe recommendations based on individual profile. Our results suggest that certain ingredients (e.g. mozzarella) uniquely represent a particular cuisine (e.g. Italian) and that there are strong clusters of adjacent countries."}, {"heading": "9.
