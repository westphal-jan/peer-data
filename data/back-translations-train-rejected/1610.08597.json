Prior to analyzing any textual context retrieved from their social media posts, we know that a post originates from a gang member could help systems better understand the message conveyed by that post. Wijeratne et al. developed a framework to analyze what gang members post on social media [WDSD15]. Their framework could only extract social media posts from self-identified gang members by looking for pre-identified band names in a user's Twitter profile description. Patton et al. developed a method to collect tweets from a group of gang members operating in Detroit, MI [Pat15]. Their approach required the word names of gang members to be known beforehand, and the profiles collection was often localized to a small town in a small area."}, {"heading": "3 Word Embeddings", "text": "A word embedding model is a neural network that learns rich representations of words in a text corpus. It takes data from a large, n-dimensional \"word space\" (where n is the number of unique words in a corpus) and learns a transformation of the data into a lower k-dimensional space of real numbers. This transformation is developed in such a way that similarities between the k-dimensional vector representation of two words reflect semantic relationships between the words themselves. This semantics is not captured by typical lexicon or n-gram models for classification tasks on text data [MYZ13, MSC + 13].Word embeddings have resulted in the state of the art results in many sequential learning tasks [LBH15]. Indeed, word embedding learning is an important step for many statistical language modeling tasks in text systems."}, {"heading": "3.1 Features considered", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of them are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

It was developed by querying the API4 Followerwonk web service with location-neutral seeds that are known to be used by gang members in their Twitter profiles in the US. However, the dataset was further expanded by examining the friends, followers and retweet networks of the gang member profile found by searching for seed words. Specific details about our data shortening process are discussed in [BWDS16]. Ultimately, this dataset consists of 400 gang member profiles and 2,865 non-gang member profiles. For each user profile, we have up to most of the current 3,200 tweets from their Twitter timelines, profile description text, profile and cover images, as well as the comments and video descriptions for each of them to be shared on YouTube, YouTube."}, {"heading": "4.2 10-fold cross validation", "text": "We performed 10-fold cross-validation experiments to evaluate the performance of our models. We used all of the Twitter profiles in the dataset to conduct experiments with the five methods we used to combine word embedding vectors; for each of the five vector combination methods (as mentioned in Section 3.2), we trained classifiers using every learning algorithm we considered; in each fold, the learning sentence was used to generate word embedding vectors, which were then used to calculate characteristics for both the training set and the test set. For each 10-fold cross-validation experiment, we report three evaluation metrics for the \"gait\" (positive) and \"non-gait\" (negative), namely the precision = tp / (tp + fp), recall = tp / (tp + fn) and F1 score = 2 (precision) recall / (precision) recall, with the true number of positives, the false number of positives, the false number of positives, and the n in the negative number."}, {"heading": "4.3 Experimental results", "text": "The aforementioned models are capable of reactivating the aforementioned characteristics in the aforementioned areas; the two basic models differ only in relation to the aforementioned characteristics, which are worth mentioning in the aforementioned areas."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "Using a Twitter dataset consisting of 400 profiles of gang members and 2,865 profiles of non-gang members, we trained word embedding models based on tweets, profile descriptions, emojis, images and videos shared on Twitter (text features extracted from images and videos), and then used pre-trained word embedding models to train supervised machine learning classifiers that performed superior compared to the state-of-the-art base models reported in the literature. We plan to further expand our work by building our own image classification system specifically designed to identify images frequently shared by gang members, such as firearms, gang handmarks, stacks of cash and medicines. We would also like to experiment with the automatic construction of dictionaries containing band names and band-related slang using crowd-sourced knowledge bases such as WikiHip6."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Sujan Perera and Monireh Ebrahimi for their thought-provoking discussions on this topic.
