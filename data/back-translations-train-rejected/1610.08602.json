Although the number of existing architectures is nearing several hundred, most of the existing surveys do not reflect this growth and focus on a handful of well-established architectures. While their contributions are undeniable, they represent only a part of the research in the field. Thus, in this survey we wanted to shift the focus towards a more inclusive and high-level overview of the research in cognitive architectures. Our final set of 86 architectures includes 55 that are still actively developed, and borrow from a diverse set of disciplines, spanning areas from psychoanalysis to neuroscience. To keep the length of this paper within reasonable limits we discuss only the core cognitive abilities, such as perception, attention mechanisms, learning and memory structure. To assess the breadth of practical applications of cognitive architectures we gathered information on over 700 practical projects implemented using the cognitive architectures in our list. We use various visualization techniques to highlight overall trends in the development of the field. Our analysis of practical applications shows that most architectures are very narrowly focused on a particular application domain. Furthermore, there is an apparent gap between general research in robotics and computer vision and research in these areas within the cognitive architectures field. It is very clear that biologically inspired models do not have the same range and efficiency compared to the systems based on engineering principles and heuristics. Another observation is related to a general lack of collaboration. Several factors hinder communication, such as the closed nature of the individual projects (only one-third of the reviewed here architectures are open-source) and terminological differences.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 03:48:33 GMT  (2127kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08602v1", "37 pages, 11 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 02:58:54 GMT  (2341kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08602v2", "63 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "37 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["iuliia kotseruba", "john k tsotsos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.08602"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.08602.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Review of 40 Years of Cognitive Architecture Research: Focus on Perception, Attention, Learning and Applications", "authors": ["Iuliia Kotseruba", "Oscar J.

Perception learning refers to architectures that actively change the way sensory information is handled or how patterns are learned online. This type of learning is often used to obtain implicit knowledge about the environment, such as spatial maps (4D-RCS [200], AIS [201], MicroPsi [202]), clustering of visual characteristics (HTM [203], BECCA [204], Leabra [42]) or finding associations between perceptions. The latter can be used within the same sensory modality as in the case of the agent controlled by the Novamente engine that selects an image of the object they wish to receive from a teacher [205]. Learning can also take place between different modalities, for example, the robot learning the ASSE-based architecture [ASS69] and its association with Darem II."}, {"heading": "Declarative learning", "text": "In production systems such as ACT-R, Soar, and others that implement chunking mechanisms (SAL [207], ADAPT [208], CHREST [209], CLARION [40]), learning new declarative knowledge is automatic, i.e., each time a goal is completed, a new chunk is added to the declarative memory. Automatic knowledge acquisition has also been demonstrated in systems with distributed representations, for example, in DSO knowledge can be entered directly by human experts or learned as contextual information extracted from marked training data [210]. New symbolic knowledge can also be acquired by applying logical follow-up rules to already known facts (GMU-BICA [211], Pupils [212], Kasimir [176], NARS [213]). In biologically inspired systems, learning new concepts usually takes the form of learning the NovU-BICA [213], Pupils [212], Kasimir [176], NARS [213])."}, {"heading": "Procedural learning", "text": "Procedural learning enables an intelligent system to learn new behaviors or modify existing ones. It is easiest to collect examples of successfully solved problems that can be reused later. For example, for a navigation task, a tracked path could be saved and later reused to go back and forth between the same places (AIS [201]). However, the same is true for brainteasers where previously generated plans or solutions are added to memory (Companions [216], RoboCog [217]). Obviously, this type of learning is very limited and further processing of forgotten experiences is needed for greater efficiency and flexibility. Many examples of procedural learning through episodic learning are described in the following chapter."}, {"heading": "Attentional learning", "text": "In fact, most people are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they want."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "In this paper we present a broad overview of the last 40 years of research on cognitive architectures.
