Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) [9] have proposed to address this problem. They are designed to protect a network by providing a line of defense capable of detecting and responding to network attacks. Two main approaches are used in building an IDS: i) abuse-based and ii) anomaly-based detection. While the former focuses on detecting attacks that follow a known pattern or signature, the latter is interested in developing a model that represents the normal behavior of the system, while all derived activities are anomalous or intrusions. As a result, the anomaly detection has gained increasing attention in the recent past. Anomaly detection has been tackled with various approaches (see [2] for a survey."}, {"heading": "2 Foundations", "text": "In this context, AISs have attracted attention because they have an analogy to the biological immune system. They are particularly attractive for abnormal recognition problems because they are particularly suitable to be applied in the context of abnormal body cells. In order to enhance the performance of AISs, it is necessary to use algorithms that have a strong representational capacity."}, {"heading": "3 The Voronoi diagrams-based evolutionary algorithm", "text": "We will now discuss the building blocks of VorEAl. In particular, we will introduce variation operators, the possible strategies for evaluating individuals and how these elements are put together to form an algorithm."}, {"heading": "3.1 Variation operators", "text": "The Voronoi genotypes are a variable longitudinal list of Voronoi sites (S1,.., Sp), with p [Pmin, Pmax], where each site is defined by its n-coordinates in E.

Due to this fact, the existing metrics developed to assess the quality of a classification algorithm seem to be applicable in this context as well. (For this particular problem, the most relevant metrics are accuracy, recall and specificity, although many more might be useful. Accuracy seems to be the best choice in the general case, since one wants to correctly identify all examples, but in dealing with anomalies in general, the dataset is highly unbalanced, as there are usually less anomalous instances than \"normal.\""}, {"heading": "3.3 Algorithm description", "text": "VorEAl consolidates the previous components as an algorithm that constructs a classification model, starting with the creation of an initial random population P0 of npop individuals. At some point, individuals in the Pt population are mutated and paired with the operators described above, thus creating a progeny population P0 of noff individuals. At this point, individuals that have not yet been evaluated are presented with the data set and the values of the various objective functions are calculated. In this work, we calculate the accuracy, retrieval and specificity, but it should be noted that others are available. From the unification of Pt and Poff, the best npop are selected using the non-dominated sorting selection of NSGA-II [3]. This process repeats until the stop criterion of the algorithm is met. If this happens, the algorithm has a final population Pfinal that can be selected from the \"best individuals to represent the self.\""}, {"heading": "4 Experimental study", "text": "Previous discussions and proposals need to be complemented by a series of experiments that establish the validity of VorEAl and examine the effects of the various components. That's the focus of this article. As I said, the most important questions that are asked about VorEAl are that most people would actually achieve better results. It could be argued that there are more ways to guide the search process to complex and resource-intensive issues. It is important to examine the impact of each objective, which is why various combinations have been tested. In particular, we have tested the accuracy and compactness of the results (a / c)."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion and conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced VorEAl, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on Voronoi diagrams for representation. VorEAl was developed with the problem of detecting anomalies in mind, and the experimental results obtained in this work indicate that this is a promising direction of work, but there are many areas that should be further investigated and explored. From an algorithmic point of view, we should explore other classification goals (metrics). It is important to try other multi-objective fitness mappings, such as those based on multi-objective performance indicators or reference points. The latter approach is of particular interest because, as already mentioned, we have an a priori known ideal solution that can be used to orientate the search. In parallel, work should be undertaken to understand and reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. In this direction, we are already working on calculating the cost of the approximation of the objective to reduce the cost of the objective algorithm."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was funded by the project PIA-FSN-P3344-146479.
