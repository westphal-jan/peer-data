Methods: The risk scoring system learns a set of latent patient subtypes from the offline electronic health record data, and trains a mixture of Gaussian Process (GP) experts, where each expert models the physiological data streams associated with a specific patient subtype. Transfer learning techniques are used to learn the relationship between a patient's latent subtype and her static admission information (e.g. age, gender, transfer status, ICD-9 codes, etc). Results: Experiments conducted on data from a heterogeneous cohort of 6,321 patients admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center show that our risk score significantly and consistently outperforms the currently deployed risk scores, such as the Rothman index, MEWS, APACHE and SOFA scores, in terms of timeliness, true positive rate (TPR), and positive predictive value (PPV). Conclusion: Our results reflect the importance of adopting the concepts of personalized medicine in critical care settings; significant accuracy and timeliness gains can be achieved by accounting for the patients' heterogeneity. Significance: The proposed risk scoring methodology can confer huge clinical and social benefits on more than 200,000 critically ill inpatient who exhibit cardiac arrests in the US every year.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:54:04 GMT  (1019kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08853v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ahmed m alaa", "jinsung yoon", "scott hu", "mihaela van der schaar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.08853"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.08853.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Personalized Risk Scoring for Critical Care Prognosis using Mixtures of Gaussian Processes", "authors": ["Ahmed M.

Data Description", "text": "Experiments were conducted on a cohort of 6,321 patients hospitalized between March 3, 2013 and February 4, 2016. Patient populations are heterogeneous with a variety of diagnoses and ICD-9 codes. Distribution of ICD-9 codes associated with patients in the cohort is shown in Figure.6. The cohort includes patients who were not on immunosuppression and others who were on immunosuppression, including patients who received solid organ transplants. In addition, there were some patients who had diagnoses of leukemia or lymphoma. Some of these patients received stem cell transplants as part of their treatment. As these patients receive chemotherapy to significantly reduce their immune system prior to stem cell transplantation, they face an increased risk of clinical deterioration. Of the 6,321 patients (Dataset D), 524 patients experienced clinical deterioration and were admitted to the ICU."}, {"heading": "B. Subtype Discovery", "text": "When executing the risk-scoring algorithm on the 5,130 patients in the test group, the algorithm was able to detect \u03b26 patient subtypes (G = 6) and train the appropriate GP experts. Figure 7 shows the range under Curve (AUC) performance of the proposed algorithm versus the number of subtypes. For G < 6, the gain achieved by capturing the heterogeneity of the patient population dominates the losses sustained due to the increased model complexity. For G > 6, adding more subtypes increases the complexity of the risk model G < 6, without capturing further heterogeneity, and thus the performance decreases of the patient population. Setting the number of subtypes such as G = 6 experts is optimal given the size of dataset D; the offline algorithm Aoff stops after calculating the Bayes factor B6.5 (see line 18 in Algorithm 1).

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have developed a personalized risk-scoring algorithm for critically ill patients on wards that makes it possible to quickly refer patients who deteriorate to the ICU. The algorithm learns a granular risk-scoring model that is tailored to the individual characteristics of the patient by modelling the physiological processes of the patient through a mixture of multitask Gaussian processes whose weighting is determined by the basic information of patient enrollment and the latent subtypes discovered from the training data. We have demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed risk-scoring algorithm based on a series of experiments conducted on a heterogeneous cohort of 6,321 critically ill patients recently admitted to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Experiments have shown that the proposed risk score significantly exceeds the currently used risk scores, such as the Rothman Index, MEWS, APACHE and SOFA scores, in terms of positive, perceptibility and accuracy."}], "references": [{"title": "Using electronic health record data to develop and validate a prediction model for adverse outcomes on the wards", "author": ["M.M.

In this paper, we develop a personalized real-time risk scoring algorithm that provides timely and granular assessments for the clinical acuity of ward patients based on their (temporal) lab tests and vital signs; the proposed risk scoring system ensures timely intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for clinically deteriorating patients. Methods: The risk scoring system learns a set of latent patient subtypes from the offline electronic health record data, and trains a mixture of Gaussian Process (GP) experts, where each expert models the physiological data streams associated with a specific patient subtype. Transfer learning techniques are used to learn the relationship between a patient\u2019s latent subtype and her static admission information (e.g. age, gender, transfer status, ICD-9 codes, etc). Results: Experiments conducted on data from a heterogeneous cohort of 6,321 patients admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center show that our risk score significantly and consistently outperforms the currently deployed risk scores, such as the Rothman index, MEWS, APACHE and SOFA scores, in terms of timeliness, true positive rate (TPR), and positive predictive value (PPV). Conclusion: Our results reflect the importance of adopting the concepts of personalized medicine in critical care settings; significant accuracy and timeliness gains can be achieved by accounting for the patients\u2019 heterogeneity. Significance: The proposed risk scoring methodology can confer huge clinical and social benefits on more than 200,000 critically ill inpatient who exhibit cardiac arrests in the US every year.
