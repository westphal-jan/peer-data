INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest and most complex experimental facility ever built. It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries, as well as hundreds of professionals and laboratories. Its scope includes (among others) 1232 superconducting dipole magnets located below the border between France and Switzerland. Building this largest and most complex experimental facility requires many teams of professionals and complex processes operating in the domain of cryogenics, electrical engineering, computer science, materials science, physics and other fields."}, {"heading": "2. ELQA FRAMEWORK", "text": "ELQA Framework was developed for the fast design of the data analysis application at the TE-MPE-EE. Framework was designed for the ELQA group, where there is a need to address an enormous amount of data collected during the hardware commissioning of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). During the commissioning process, the conditions of the machine's circuits are verified and implemented by various measurements in all 8 sectors of the machine. Based on software design, the following requirements were carefully identified: (a) similarities of the search signal over the enormous amount of tests, (b) visualization of measurement trends across the time domain in data, (c) the development of appropriate data models for different variants of ELQA measurements such as TP4 (test method 4), DOC (dipole orbit correctors), MIC (magnetic instrumentation check), (d) the development of data models for different types of ELQA measurements."}, {"heading": "2.1. ELQA FRAMEWORK CHARACTERISTICS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1.1. Data models", "text": "The Django framework manages this mapping and provides all the functionality of a Structure Query Language (SQL). Django's architecture consists of (a) the lowest level, the ELQA database, followed by (b) the access library, which is responsible for communicating between Python and the database through SQL statements, here we used a Python library x-oracle [5] and (c) a specific Django database back-end, on which every database supported by Django (PostgreSQL, MySql, SQLite and Oracle) is supported [3]. Above the levels of Django, a data model for accessing the data from ELQA is then defined. Data models can be efficiently programmed using Django tools such as inspectdb to automatically define models from database tables, with relationships between tables defined separately."}, {"heading": "2.1.2. Preprocessors", "text": "Preprocessors are classes for analytical pre-processing of signals within defined operators by ELQA engineers. For signal extraction, the following basic statistics are currently used (and can be extended) as extractors: mean, minimum, maximum, skew, kurtosis, and properties of the linear regression applied to each signal, such as slope and standard errors. Scipy and Numpy libraries [6, 7] are used by the implementation of the preprocessors."}, {"heading": "2.1.3. Data-miners", "text": "Scikit-learn, a machine learning library written in Python, is selected for Data Miner in the ELQA Framework. It builds on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib and is licensed under the BSD Open Source License [4]. Although there are many solutions and tools for data analysis available as open source packages or commercial packages, some of the most commonly used tools in the fields of data mining, analytics, big data and data science are found on the KDnuggets network managed by a group of specialists and researchers [8], Scikit-learn has been selected as the most suitable, as written in Python and has a strong community around the library. The Data Miner layer defines the general class for analyzers. Currently, two different cluster algorithms are integrated from the scikit-learn, such as K-means clustering [9] and DBScan clustering, a dense Peter Kriegel-based spatial framework of Jorwei, Jorge-learn and Jorge-Ewei, developed in 1996."}, {"heading": "2.1.4. Visualizers", "text": "Visualizers are used for user interaction and visualization of the data. In the search for suitable tools in communities, many frameworks in different programming languages were reconsidered. Due to the required architecture (see other evaluated libraries in Fig. 1), Bokeh was selected after studying the appropriate available solutions. Main reason for this was Bokeh's ability to act as a web server in order to provide a full-fledged visualization and analysis tool to several users [2]."}, {"heading": "3. CONCEPT OF USING THE LSTM-BASED SOLUTION", "text": "The idea behind the use of the LSTM quench detection and prediction algorithm is based on the unique and very useful properties of this deep learning algorithm when modelling time series. It turns out that a currently used quench protection solution [11, 12] can in some cases be supplemented by an additional monitoring layer that monitors the performance of the Quench Protection System. One of the biggest challenges in implementing the LSTM concept is the construction of the network architecture by selecting a correct set of hyperparameters such as the number of layers, neurons within each layer and the input size. This is done in a trial-error way that can be used significantly by using a suitable framework. Such a framework allows visualization of the performance of a given network instance as well as easy manipulation of its macro parameter values."}, {"heading": "3.1. RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves, and they are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "3.2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP", "text": "The first research question we had to answer related to a period of time surrounding a quenching event that should be taken into account for the LSTM model training. A one-day dataset of a single voltage time series for only one magnet occupies about 100 MB, and there are several voltage time series associated with a single magnet [26], but ultimately we decided to use only one in our experiments, namely Ures. Different types of magnets are used in the LHC, and they generate a different number of quenching events. From the perspective of our research, it is extremely beneficial to select a magnet for which a large number of quenching results are provided, namely Ures. The longest history of quenches was provided for 600A magnets in the Timber database, and we have decided to focus our initial research on 600A magnets. Unfortunately, the data covering a quenching period of 600A magnets is very large."}, {"heading": "4. INTEGRATING LSTM MODEL INTO ELQA FRAMEWORK", "text": "The described LSTM concept, developed at TE-MPE-EE, can be efficiently used within the ELQA framework to implement a quench prediction application for the end user. The following features and key benefits are identified to combine these two research activities: (a) efficient application of quench detection and prediction research, (b) incorporation of the quench detection application into the web environment, (c) need for an efficient graphical user interface for the end user, (d) availability of a high level of user interaction experience in the developed quench detection application. Figure 6 represents a possible integration of the LSTM into the framework. It is evident that the LSTM concept should be packaged by the new LSTM analysis class and subsequently used in the ELQA framework. The graphical user interface is a next step of the web application that should be designed by a quashboard prediction app."}, {"heading": "4.1. INTEGRATING LSTM-BASED SOLUTION", "text": "Analysis class in ELQA is a general class in which data mining algorithms from Scikit-Learn Data Mining library are integrated. LSTM concept for quench prediction is implemented in Python at TE-MPE-EE and can be logically integrated into ELQA with an extended LSTM from the analyser. Access to the data in the wood database is extended by a new data model. ELQA framework allows the definition of a new stack for integrating access to the various datasets and stacks through Django library. Fig. 7 represents a possible integration. When model and algorithm are integrated into the ELQA classes, the full development of the dashboard can then be applied through the user interface and interaction framework developed for a quench prediction app."}, {"heading": "4.2. IMPLEMENTING QUENCH PREDICTION DASHBOARD - APP DEVELOPMENT", "text": "With built-in data model for accessing the Timber dataset and wrapped LSTM algorithm of the Quench Prediction software within the analyzer class, efficient development of the web application for quench prediction can be accomplished by programming an inherited LSTM dashboard. IN LSTM dashboard widgets for the graphical user interface are defined and then integrated through the bokeh library (input forms, diagrams) where the data is applied to the LSTM algorithm. Fig. 8 represents the concept of dashboard implementation by ELQA. It is evident (Fig.) that conceptual blocks in programming dashboards for quench prediction applications follow objects that need to be defined in the dashboard: (a) Input widget for user interaction (lists, input boxes, sliders, etc.), (diagram) to calculate the data quango (plotting algorithm) for accessing the dashboard (s)."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We presented a concept paper to integrate the LSTM quench detection techniques into the web application, using the ELQA framework to prototyping data analysis applications developed at TE-MPE-EE at CERN. Key features of the framework were the concept of the LSTM for quench detection. We demonstrated the mechanism and key benefits of connecting these two units to develop a quench prediction app for TE-MPE-EE at CERN. As explained, the LSTM concept can be efficiently integrated to provide an application that can be used by engineers in providing hardware commissioning procedures for the LHC at CERN."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank the entire ELQA team and TE-MPE-EE at CERN for their persistent and valuable help throughout the development process."}], "references": [{"title": "V", "author": ["F.
