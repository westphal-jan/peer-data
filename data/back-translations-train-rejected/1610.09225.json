INTRODUCTIONPrevious studies on stock market forecasting have been based on historical stock prices. Subsequent studies have debunked the approach of forecasting stock market movements using historical prices. Stock prices are largely fluctuating.The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that financial market movements depend on news, current events, and product releases, and all of these factors have a significant impact on a company's stock valuation.2 Due to the unpredictability of news and current events, stock prices follow walking patterns and cannot be predicted with more than 50% accuracy. With the advent of social media, information about public sentiment is abundant. We are transforming social media like a perfect platform to share public emotions."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "The most well-known publication in this area was by Bollen [10], who investigated whether the collective mood of the public (happiness, calm, fear) derived from Twitter feeds is correlated with the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Index. They used a fuzzy neural network to predict it. Their results show that public mood on Twitter is strongly correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial Index. Chen and Lazer [12] identified investment strategies by monitoring and classifying Twitter feeds. Bing et al. [15] examined the tweets and concluded that the predictability of stock prices is based on the type of industries such as finance, IT, etc. Zhang [13] found a high negative correlation between mood states such as hope, fear, and concern in tweets with the Dow Jones Average Index. Recently, Brian et al. [14] investigated the correlation of public mood states with stock gains and declines using Pearson correlation coefficients for stocks."}, {"heading": "III. DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Data Collection", "text": "Twitter4J is a Java application that helps us extract tweets from Twitter. Tweets were collected using the Twitter API and filtered with keywords such as $MSFT, # Microsoft, # Windows, etc. Not only would the public's opinion about the company's shares, but opinions about the products and services offered by the company would have a significant impact and be worth investigating. On the basis of this principle, the keywords used for filtering are developed with great care and tweets extracted so that they represent the exact emotions of the public over a certain period of time via Microsoft. Twitter messages about Microsoft and tweets about product releases were also included. Microsoft IPO and closing prices from August 31, 2015 to August 25, 2016 are sourced from Yahoo! Finance [23]."}, {"heading": "B. Data Pre-Processing", "text": "The collected share price data usually follows a concave function, so if the share value is x on one day and the next value is present, something is missing in between. So, the first missing value will be approximately (y + x) / 2 and the same method will be used to fill all the gaps. Tweets consist of many acronyms, emoticons and unnecessary data such as images and URLs. So tweets are pre-processed to present correct emotions to the public. To pre-process tweets, we have applied three levels of filtering: tokenization, stop word removal and regex matching to remove specific vendors.1) Tokenization: Tweets are divided into individual words based on space and irrelevant symbols such as emoticons. We make a list of individual words for each tweet."}, {"heading": "IV. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS", "text": "The task of mood analysis is very technical. There is a lot of research on mood analysis of film reviews and news articles, and many mood analyzers are available as open source. The main problem with these analyzers is that they are trained with a different corpus. For example, the film corpus and the stock corpus are not the same. Therefore, we developed our own mood analyzer. Tweets are classified as positive, negative and neutral based on the existing mood [18]. 3,216 tweets of the entire tweet are examined by humans and commented as 1 for positive, 0 for neutral and 2 for negative emotions. To classify non-human commented tweets, a machine learning model is trained whose characteristics are derived from the human commented tweets."}, {"heading": "A. Feature Extraction", "text": "Textual representations are performed using two methods: n-gram and Word2vec representation 1) N-gram representation: N-gram representation is known for its specificity to correspond to the corpus of the text to be examined. In these techniques, a complete corpus of related texts that are tweets in the present work is analyzed, and any appearing word sequence of the length n is extracted from the tweets to form a dictionary of words and phrases. In our case, N-grams form the corpus for all tweets. In this representation, Tweet is divided into N-grams and the characteristics of the model are a string of 1s and 0s, with 1 indicating the presence of the N-gram of the tweet in the corpus and 0 indicating the absence of the tweet."}, {"heading": "B. Model Training", "text": "The characteristics extracted with the above methods for human commented tweets are fed to the classifier and trained using a random forest algorithm. Both the text representations performed well and the results are comparable.From the two models trained with word2vec representation, the meaning and promising performance compared to large datasets.The results of the mood classification are discussed in the following sections. The developed classifier is used to predict the emotions of non-human commented tweets. Table 1 shows a sample of commented tweets from the mood analyzer."}, {"heading": "V. CORRELATION ANALYSIS OF PRICE AND SENTIMENT", "text": "If the share price of the previous day is higher than the current share price, the current day is marked with a numerical value of 0, otherwise with a numerical value of 1. Now, this correlation analysis proves to be a classification problem. All positive, negative and neutral emotions in tweets over a 3-day period are calculated consecutively, which are used as characteristics for the classification model, and the output is the labeled value of the next day of shares 0 or 1. The window size is experimented and best results are obtained when the mood values are 3 days ahead of the share price. A total of 355 cases, each with 3 attributes, are submitted to the classifier for review with a split ratio of 80% pull data set and the remaining data set. Accuracy of the classifier is discussed in the Results section."}, {"heading": "VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "This section provides an overview of the accuracy rates of the trained classifiers. All calculations are performed in the Weka tool, which is run on a Java virtual machine [20]."}, {"heading": "A. Sentiment Analyzer Results", "text": "The classifier, with features such as Word2vec representations of human commented tweets trained on the Random Forest algorithm at a fraction of 90 percent for model training and subsequent testing, showed an accuracy of 70.2 percent. Using N-gram representations, the classification model showed an accuracy of 70.5 percent using the same algorithm and the same dataset. Although the results are very accurate, the model trained with word2vec representations is selected to classify the non-human commented tweets due to its promising accuracy for large datasets and sustainability in word meaning. Numerous studies have been conducted on humans and they have concluded that the degree of agreement between people about the mood of a text is between 70% and 79% [21]. They have also synthesized that mood analyzers over 70% are very accurate in most cases."}, {"heading": "B. Stock Price and Sentiment Correlation Results", "text": "In the previous sections, a classifier is presented which is presented with aggregated sentiment values for a period of 3 days as characteristics and the rise / fall of the share price, which represents 1 / 0 as output. Overall, the data is divided into two parts, 80 percent to train the model and remain for testing. The results of the classifier show an accuracy of 69.01% when trained with logistic regression algorithms, and the accuracy rate varies with the training set. If the model is trained with LibSVM with 90 percent of the data, the result is 71.82%. These results give investors a significant advantage and they show a good correlation between stock market movements and the feelings expressed on Twitter. This trend shows that the models perform well with increasing data set. We would like to incorporate more data into our future work."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this work, we have shown that there is a strong correlation between the rise / fall of a company's share price and the opinions or emotions expressed on Twitter about that company through tweets. The most important contribution of our work is the development of a mood analyser that can assess the nature of the feelings contained in the tweet. Tweets are divided into three categories: positive, negative and neutral. Initially, we claimed that positive emotions or feelings of the public about a company on Twitter would be reflected in the share price. Our speculation is well supported by the results obtained and seems to have a promising future in research."}, {"heading": "VIII. FUTURE WORK", "text": "Stocktwits [22] is a financial communication platform designed exclusively for the exchange of ideas and insights from investors, entrepreneurs and traders, and the current study can be expanded by incorporating stock tweets data, as well as news data for a comprehensive public opinion survey. 3,216 tweets are used during the Mood Analyser training, which is comparatively little to train a Mood Analyst. In the future, we look forward to commenting on more than 10,000 tweets and training the classifiers, and as the training datasets grow in size, the models tend to perform better."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors would like to thank the students of IIT Bhubaneswar who contributed to the human commentary of tweets."}], "references": [{"title": "Stock market prediction with multiple classifiers, Applied Intelligence", "author": ["Qian", "Bo", "Rasheed", "Khaled"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2007}, {"title": "The behavior of stock-market prices", "author": ["E.F.
