The aim here is to examine whether the combination of text segmentation and information extraction can be beneficial for the identification of the various topics that appear in a document. NER was performed manually in the English corpus and was compared with the output produced by publicly available annotation tools while, an already existing tool was used for the Greek corpus. Produced annotations from both corpora were manually corrected and enriched to cover four types of named entities. Co-reference resolution i.e., substitution of every reference of the same instance with the same named entity identifier was subsequently performed. The evaluation, using five text segmentation algorithms for the English corpus and four for the Greek corpus leads to the conclusion that, the benefit highly depends on the segment's topic, the number of named entity instances appearing in it, as well as the segment's length.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 14:09:33 GMT  (143kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09226v1", "32 pages. arXiv admin

Italic and underlined notation is used for obtained results for all files and all cases in every segmentation algorithm. Table 13 reveals that segmentation performance was improved in the annotated corpus using both NE and co-reference resolution for all accuracy metrics and for all algorithms, with the exception of Window Diff performance for the Utiyama & Isahara\u2019s algorithm, where a slight decrease is observed. An explanation is that in this dataset, the segment length is high leading to a high number of named entity instances. For all metrics and for all algorithms, increase in performance is achieved using co-reference resolution. Special attention must be given to co-reference resolution, which proved to have a significant contribution in the increase of the number of named entity instances per segment. Experiments using only Lucarelli\u2019s et al. annotation tool exhibit lower performance compared with the nonannotated corpus, except for all values of Beeferman\u2019s Pk as well as WindowDiff performance obtained by Choi\u2019s C99b and Affinity Propagation algorithms. This can be attributed to the fact that, annotation tools augment text vocabulary with the presence of unnecessary tags. Additionally, obtained performance by the application of co-reference resolution step at the output produced by Lucarelli\u2019s et al. NER tool, proves the effectiveness and importance of both steps. This results from obtained results in all metrics and for all algorithms, except for Affinity Propagation\u2019s WindowDiff performance, where a slight decrease is observed. The type of named entity instance for both groups of experiments acts once again indirectly as a discriminative factor in the segmentation process. Since, as we mentioned earlier for English, the type thus the number of occurrences of named entity instances is strongly related to document\u2019s topic, documents belonging for example to Kiosse author - whose texts are about archaeology have more named entity instances of person name, date, and location than of group name. The opposite holds for Alachiotis documents which are about biology, where group name is the most frequent named entity type. Co- reference resolution proved once again to enhance segmentation accuracy by reinforcing the presence and frequency of appearance of named entity instances (i.e., words and phrases) and consequently, intra-segment similarity. The obtained performance of segmentation algorithms measured by WindowDiff metric in the current dataset in both groups of experiments can be also be attributed to the annotation performed using the Lucarelli, Vasilakos and Androutsopoulos (2007) annotation tool, which was trained on similar topics.", "startOffset": 129, "endOffset": 3137}], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "In this paper we examine the benefit of performing named entity recognition (NER) and co-reference resolution to an English and a Greek corpus used for text segmentation. The aim here is to examine whether the combination of text segmentation and information extraction can be beneficial for the identification of the various topics that appear in a document. NER was performed manually in the English corpus and was compared with the output produced by publicly available annotation tools while, an already existing tool was used for the Greek corpus. Produced annotations from both corpora were manually corrected and enriched to cover four types of named entities. Co-reference resolution i.e., substitution of every reference of the same instance with the same named entity identifier was subsequently performed. The evaluation, using five text segmentation algorithms for the English corpus and four for the Greek corpus leads to the conclusion that, the benefit highly depends on the segment\u2019s topic, the number of named entity instances appearing in it, as well as the segment\u2019s length.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
