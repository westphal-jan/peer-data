RELATED WORK", "text": "Gang violence is a well-researched social science topic dating back to 1927 [18]. However, the terms \"cyber\" or \"internet bang,\" which are defined as \"the phenomenon that gang members use social media to exchange insults or make violent threats that lead to murder or victimization,\" [8] were only recently introduced [19]. Patton et al. introduced the concept of \"internet bang\" and explored how social media is now used as a tool for self-promotion by gang members and as a way for gang members to gain and maintain credibility on the street [8]. They also discussed the relationship between gang-related crime and hip-hop culture and gave examples of how hip-hop music on social media websites aimed at harassing rival gang members often resulted in real collisions between these gangs. Decker and Patalet videos and Patalet have reported on the problem of gang architecture, [20 and Patalet also reported on the problem of street violence]."}, {"heading": "III. DISCOVERING GANG MEMBER PROFILES", "text": "This section discusses the methodology we have used to automatically study and classify the Twitter profiles of gang members. It includes a semi-automatic data collection process to detect a large number of verifiable gang profiles, an evaluation of tweets from posts by gang and non-gang members to identify promising features, and the use of multiple monitored learning algorithms to perform the classification."}, {"heading": "A. Data collection", "text": "Finding profiles of gang members on Twitter to train them and test records is a challenging task. Previous strategies for finding these profiles have been to search for keywords, phrases and events that are known to be related to gang activity in a particular city a priori [11], [21]. However, such region-specific tweets and profiles can hardly provide adequate data to train an automatic classifier, since gang members from different geographic locations and cultures use local languages, site-specific hashtags and information related to activities in a local region [11]. Such region-specific tweets and profiles can be used to train a classifier to find gang members within a small region, but not across the Twitterverse. To overcome these limitations, we have introduced a semi-automatic workflow illustrated in Figure 2 to identify a set of gang members we identified as group members Profilers-1. We began using Discovery members to build a database of universally identified gang members for training purposes."}, {"heading": "2.

[8] that the influence of hip hop music and culture on the activities of offline gang members can also be seen in their social media posts. Therefore, we also look at the influence of hip hop culture on Twitter by examining the Twitter network of well-known gangster rappers who were murdered in 2015 due to gang-related incidents.8 We searched for these rapper profiles on Twitter and manually checked if the rapper belongs to a gang. 3.

To this end, we use the training discussed in Section III with 400 profiles of the band members (the \"positive\" / \"gang\" class) and 2,865 non-band members profiles (the \"negative\" / \"non-gang\" class). We trained and evaluated the performance of the classifiers mentioned in Section III-C as part of a 10x cross-validation scheme. For each of the four learning algorithms, we consider variations that include only tweet text, emoji, image or music (YouTube comments and video description) features and a final variant that takes all kinds of features into account. Classifiers who use a single feature should help us study the quality of their predictive power ourselves. In building these single-feature classifiers, we filtered the training data based on the availability of each feature type."}, {"heading": "A.

Evaluation Over Unseen Profiles", "text": "For this experiment, we included real-time tweets from Los Angeles, CA16, and ten South Side, Chicago neighborhoods known for gang-related activity. [11] We looked at these areas with a known gang presence on social media to make sure some positive profiles appeared in our test set. We ultimately collected 24,162 Twitter profiles: 15,662 from Los Angeles and 8,500 from Chicago. We collected data for each profile using the 3,200 most recent tweets (the maximum that can be collected from the Twitter API) for each profile."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Despite the challenges of developing such automated systems, mainly due to difficulties in finding online gang profiles to develop training datasets, we proposed an approach that uses functions from text descriptions, emojis, images and videos shared on Twitter (text functions from images and videos).The explorative analysis of these types of functions revealed interesting and sometimes striking differences in the way gang members and non-gang members use Twitter. Classifiers trained on features that highlight these differences were rated under 10-fold cross validation. Our best classifier scored a promising F1 score of 0.7755 over the \"gang profiles\" when all kinds of features were taken into account. Future work will strengthen our training dataset by including more gang members Twitter profiles by looking for more location-independent keywords. We also plan to develop our own classification system specifically designed for classifying images from tape profiles that we would like to experiment with when designing our band descriptions."}, {"heading": "VI.
