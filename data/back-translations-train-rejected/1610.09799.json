The development of social media platforms such as blogs, micro-blogs (e.g. Twitter) and chats (e.g. Facebook messages) has created many new sources of access to information and language technologies, but the same has presented many new challenges, making it one of the most important current areas of research. Most of the Indians and many other nonEnglish speakers around the world do not always use Unicode to write something on social media, they use translation techniques and often add English elements through code mixing and Anglicisms, and mix multiple languages to express their thoughts."}, {"heading": "2 Data-sets", "text": "For the experiments, we used 80% of the training data shared by POSCMISMT, which is described in detail in Table 1. Tests for the experiments were performed on the remaining 20% data, but the final transmission system was trained on the overall data. Systems submitted were evaluated by the organizers on the basis of a test corpus."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments and Results", "text": "We have used the Stanford POS Tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000; Toutanova et al., 2003), which is available on the Stanford Natural Language Processing Group website for restricted training and results submission, and unrestricted training and results submissions have been conducted with word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and WEKA (Hall et al., 2009)."}, {"heading": "3.1 POS Tagging using Stanford POS tagger: Constrained", "text": "We trained Stanford POS taggers based on the train data provided. Basically, this POS tagger learns from highlighted text a log-linear conditional probability model using a maximum entropy method. The POS tag of the input word is then decided by the model based on the context and surrounding tags of the word. The architecture (archproperty) we used for the training was: Words (-2, 2), Order (1), Prefix (6), Suffix (6), Unicode forms (1)."}, {"heading": "3.2 POS tagging using Machine Learning: Unconstrained", "text": "We used WEKA to experiment with the application of various machine learning techniques to the POS tagging problem. Various combinations of the following word features were used for training and testing the system: 1. Language of the word 2. Language of the previous word 3. Language of the next word 4. POS tags of the previous two words5. POS tags of the next two wordsimilarities 6. Position of the word in sentencesIn a sentence with the length L, words at positions 1, 2, L and L-1 were assigned the required number of default identifiers for previous and next languages as well as POS tags. For the POS tag of the next word, we used a distributed representation of the words in the vector space. We trained a word2vec model based on traction and test corpus detailed in Table 1. For the POS tag of the next word, we followed one of the following steps: 1. The word was searched from the list of training data when the most common word was found."}, {"heading": "4 Submission to the Shared Task", "text": "Table 2 shows that the decision tree of J48 yielded better results and was therefore used to train the final submission system. Submitted results were evaluated by the organisers and presented in detail by the organisers in Table 3."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Feature Work", "text": "In this article, we introduced two techniques for POS marking of code-mixed Indian social media texts. The method used for restricted transmission is doing well, but for lack of high-quality training data, there is not much to do with it. On the other hand, the use of distributed vector representation of words in feature engineering could allow us to use unlabeled data for training. Results are encouraging and future work can focus on obtaining more social media corpus and using it to better represent features."}], "references": [{"title": "The weka data mining software: an update", "author": ["Hall et al.2009] Mark Hall", "Eibe Frank", "Geoffrey Holmes", "Bernhard Pfahringer", "Peter Reutemann", "Ian H Witten"], "venue": "ACM SIGKDD explorations newsletter,", "citeRegEx": "Hall et al\\.,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Hall et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Part-of-speech tagging for code-mixed English-Hindi Twitter and Facebook chat messages", "author": ["Bj\u00f6rn Gamb\u00e4ck", "Amitava Das"], "venue": "RECENT ADVANCES IN,", "citeRegEx": "Jamatia et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Jamatia et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality", "author": ["Ilya Sutskever", "Kai Chen", "Greg S Corrado", "Jeff Dean"], "venue": "In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,", "citeRegEx": "Mikolov et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Mikolov et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Enriching the Knowledge Sources used in a Maximum Entropy Part-of-Speech Tagger", "author": ["Toutanova", "Manning2000] Kristina Toutanova", "Christopher D Manning"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 2000 Joint SIGDAT conference on Empirical meth-", "citeRegEx": "Toutanova et al\\.,? \\Q2000\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Toutanova et al\\.", "year": 2000}, {"title": "Feature-Rich Part-of-Speech Tagging with a Cyclic Dependency Network", "author": ["Dan Klein", "Christopher D Manning", "Yoram Singer"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter", "citeRegEx": "Toutanova et al\\.,? \\Q2003\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Toutanova et al\\.", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Pos tagging of english-hindi code-mixed social media content", "author": ["Vyas et al.2014] Yogarshi Vyas", "Spandana Gella", "Jatin Sharma", "Kalika Bali", "Monojit Choudhury"], "venue": "In EMNLP,", "citeRegEx": "Vyas et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Vyas et al\\.", "year": 2014}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 1, "context": "(Jamatia et al., 2015) created a good amount of labeled corpus using amazon mechanical turk and bootstrapping.", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 22}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "We have used Stanford log-linear PartOf-Speech tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000; Toutanova et al., 2003) for tagging, word2vec (Mikolov et al.", "startOffset": 54, "endOffset": 107}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": ", 2003) for tagging, word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) for feature extraction and WEKA (Hall et al.", "startOffset": 30, "endOffset": 52}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": ", 2013) for feature extraction and WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) for machine learning.", "startOffset": 40, "endOffset": 59}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "We have used Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000; Toutanova et al., 2003) available on Stanford Natural Language Processing group\u2019s website for constrained training and result submission.", "startOffset": 33, "endOffset": 86}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "And unconstrained training and result submission has been done using word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and WEKA (Hall et al.", "startOffset": 78, "endOffset": 100}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": ", 2013) and WEKA (Hall et al., 2009).", "startOffset": 17, "endOffset": 36}], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "This paper presents Centre for Development of Advanced Computing Mumbai\u2019s (CDACM) submission to the NLP Tools Contest on Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tagging For Code-mixed Indian Social Media Text (POSCMISMT) 2015 (collocated with ICON 2015).
