The framework is able to extract users comments from Online Social Networks (OSN), to process and analyze text through information extraction and sentiment analysis techniques to obtain relevant information about product reception on the market. A use case was developed using the mobile application Uber, which is today one of the fastest growing technology companies in the world. We measured how a controversial, highly diffused event influences the volume of tweets about Uber and the perception of its users. While there is no change in the image of Uber, a large increase in the number of tweets mentioning the company is observed, which meant a free and important diffusion of its product.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 12:25:57 GMT  (433kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09894v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["daniela ulloa", "pedro saleiro", "rosaldo j f rossetti", "elis regina silva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09894"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.09894.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Mining Social Media for Open Innovation in Transportation Systems", "authors": ["Daniela Ulloa", "Pedro Saleiro", "Rosaldo J.

Development of new Transportation Paradigms", "text": "Many studies in the literature have been intensified in order to introduce new technological solutions in the field of mobility services in order to minimize the problems arising from major cities such as traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, fuel consumption, etc. [4]. Many papers propose models of joint services to make driving services more efficient both for business models and for reducing passengers \"travel costs [5]. Common driving services that are most discussed in the literature are carpooling and taxi sharing. These services aim at sharing a single vehicle for several passengers on a journey and may or may not have local searches and similar destinations [6]. Mobile applications are attracting considerable attention for their usefulness, not only in the scientific community, but also among many companies. Services such as\" Taxi for Two in United Kingdom, \"where the taxi service is shared by two people who share similar routes and travel costs [8]."}, {"heading": "B. Open Innovation in the NPD process", "text": "A successful NPD requires two essential types of information: (1) information about customer needs and (2) information about how best to meet those needs [11]. Users have become a valuable source of innovation for businesses; today's consumers are more connected, informed, empowered and active [12] and have different experiences and backgrounds that increase companies \"competitive advantages and lower costs; because of their characteristics, companies often use years of product knowledge and experience of the exact needs and problems consumers experience to innovate more successfully [13]. Over the years, the degree of customer involvement has changed, moving from being involved in the foremost stages of innovation (early stages of the process) to participating in all phases. In light of this development, it is important that companies change their relationship with users by shifting their value creation offering from a company-centric view to a customer-centric or joint creation of services [12]."}, {"heading": "C. Social Media data processing", "text": "In [26] the authors presented the domain-agnostic framework for the intelligent processing of text streams from social networks. The framework implemented a pipeline of techniques for semantic representation, mood analysis and automatic classification of content. The authors used two scenarios related to smart cities to prove the effectiveness of the framework. In the first scenario, they monitored the recovery of the capital of the city of L'Aquila after the earthquake in April 2009, while in the second scenario, a semantic analysis of content posted on the social network Twitter was carried out to create an Italian hate map. With the results of the analysis, the authors confirmed that the methodology used for the analysis of textual content can provide interesting discoveries to improve the understanding of the very complex phenomena. In the study carried out by Saleiro et al, the POPmine system was presented, an open source system capable of gathering web-based texts from conventional media such as Twitter and blogs, and political views to track the information available to the authors, as well as the 1.1 platform to emphasize that it is the first available data collection."}, {"heading": "III. FRAMEWORK", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world in which they are able, in which they want to live, and in which they are able to integrate."}, {"heading": "IV. USE CASE", "text": "The aim is for the proposed framework to be comprehensible, with a popular and well-known mobile app that has come in a disruptive manner to change the paradigm of transportation systems.Uber Technologies Inc. was founded in 2009 in San Francisco, USA. It develops, markets and operates the Uber mobile app, which was released in June 2010, and which allows consumers with smartphones to submit a travel request, which is then forwarded to Uber drivers who use their own cars.As of June 3, 2016, the service is available in over 66 countries and 469 cities worldwide. As in other countries, the arrival of Uber in Portugal has not been without controversy. While users advocate its use, suggesting that the benefits and ease of traditional taxis far outweigh the latter, the arrival of the mobile app has not been well received as it considered unfair competition.On April 29, 2016, about four thousand taxis took to the streets of Lisbon in a slow march to protest.The manifestation began at 9: 00 am we were at the end of the National Park."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "The aim of this paper was to evaluate the impact of OSN as a user-centric information provider for companies, in order to improve their NPD processes, and to propose a framework for companies, especially in the transport sector, in order to obtain the information provided by users. The purpose of creating a system with this information is to support the decision-making process of companies, taking into account users \"opinions and feelings about products, in order to improve their qualities and better meet users\" needs. As an example of the proposed methodology, we developed a use case using the example of the Uber mobile app, chosen to be a disruptive technology that has rapidly become popular in over 66 countries around the world, transforming the traditional transport concept. In order to collect the data we have applied two filters: the search unit \"Uber and the geolocalization of Portugal. In order to avoid the polarity shift of the population in relation to perceptions of Uber due to a protest by traditional taxi drivers, we consider the tweets we have generated after the word of protest and Uber in the days before."}], "references": [{"title": "Co-creating unique value with customers", "author": ["C.
