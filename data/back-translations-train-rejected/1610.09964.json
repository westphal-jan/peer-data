We refer to these sets as label sets in general. An individual's label sets are referred to as posh label sets and an individual's label sets as label sets. The principle behind generating these label sets is that since all constraints that are met by an individual are captured in one place, it can easily be searched for redundancies. An individual's node label sets are the sets that contain all class expressions and (existential, universal and cardinal) constraints that are met by that individual. Definition 1 The node label sets of an individual x (represented as LO (x))) is defined as: LO label sets of an individual (x)."}, {"heading": "4.2.

As this is not a practically applicable method for large ontologies, we generate the label set of a single x from an ontology O as follows: First, we create the corresponding derived ontologyO's (using an argument). FromO's we find all concept names and (existential, universal and cardinal) limitations fulfilled by the individual as follows: Step 1: All concept names fulfilled by x are achieved by a simple SPARQL query. We can refer to it as the Seed Label Set. For example, the set of concept names we received from O \"corresponding to the individual tom\" is {Student, ITStudent, ITStudent, ITIStudent, I.Student, I.2 To obtain the limitations we are student."}, {"heading": "5.

How does the semantic refinement help in improving the understandability of the verbalized knowledge?", "text": "The degree of understanding of each of these descriptions for the domain experts can be identified by looking at the ratings (i.e., bad, medium, or good) that they chose during the empirical study. If there is an ambiguity in the description (due to their literal fidelity to OWL statements), they are expected to choose a low or medium level of understanding. In order to limit the reasons for the ambiguity to fidelity to OWL constructs alone, possible (manual) grammatical error corrections were made to the generated text - since we did not use sophisticated NL generation techniques. Grammatic errors such as subject-verb match errors, verb form errors, singular / plural noun termination errors, and sentence structure errors have been corrected. Figure 2 shows the overall responses we received from the seven domain experts for the PD ontology descriptions."}, {"heading": "7.1.2.

Usefulness of the generated descriptions in validating an ontology is derived from the number of descriptions marked as \"not identifiable.\" The three options: Valid, invalid and non-determinable imply that the text is useful to arrive at a conclusion, while the \"not identifiable\" option indicates that there is a problem in the representation. Figure 4 and Figure 5 in the case of the proposed approach show only 7 of 41 descriptions from PD ontology and 4 of 31 descriptions from DSA ontology that these descriptions are not useful in determining the quality of the 50% or so during the traditional paragraph."}, {"heading": "7.1.3. Discussion", "text": "The participants of our empirical study agree that by reducing redundancies in a description, the time taken to validate an individual description is reduced to a high degree. Validating an ontology also involves verifying the veracity of the ownership relationships in it, which are not addressed in this paper. This problem can be solved in the future by using the edge label sets (label sets for pairs of individuals - see Section 4.1) and mapping them to the respective limitations in the node label set of the first person. For example, LO (a) = {C1, C2, hasFriend.C3} and LO (a, b) = {hasFriend}, then Friend in LO (a, b) can be mapped in the node label set of the first person."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "A new method for verbalizing the definitions (so-called Natural Language Descriptions) of ontological entities is presented in the paper. Besides being literal translations of logical axioms of ontology, the descriptions are generated from a series of logical constraints that are fulfilled by individuals and concepts of ontology on the basis of which semantic simplifications have been carried out. To this end, we propose a rules-based reduction approach. We find that the proposed method actually provides redundancy-free descriptions of individuals and concepts. Our empirical studies, based on two ontologies, have shown that the redundancy-free description of domain knowledge is helpful for a more effective understanding of formalized knowledge and also useful for validating it."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This project is funded by the Indian Ministry of Human Resources Development and we would like to thank the participants of our evaluation process: Dr. S.

Some of these approaches also perform grouping and aggregating of these NL text segments to generate a more fluent and comprehensive form of the content.

Human-understandability of such descriptions is affected by the presence of repetitions and redundancies, as they have high fidelity to the OWL representation of the entities. In the literature, no efforts had been taken to remove redundancies and repetitions at the logical level before generating the NL descriptions of entities and we find this to be the main reason for lack of readability of the generated text. In this paper, we propose a technique called semantic-refinement to generate meaningful and easily-understandable (what we call redundancy-free) text descriptions of individuals and concepts of a given OWL ontology. We identify the combinations of OWL/DL constructs that lead to repetitive/redundant descriptions and propose a series of refinement rules to rewrite the conditions that are satisfied by an individual/concept in a meaning-preserving manner. The reduced set of conditions are then employed for generating textual descriptions. Our experiments show that, semantic-refinement technique leads to significantly improved descriptions of ontology entities. We also test the effectiveness and usefulness of the the generated descriptions for the purpose of validating the ontologies and find that the proposed technique is indeed helpful in the context.
