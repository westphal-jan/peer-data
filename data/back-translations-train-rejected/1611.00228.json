There are two main ways in which this differs from the sensor block in Figure 1: First, every single sensor in ASIN is of low or rough resolution. Second, each sensor interacts with the environment through a pre-selected application-specific measurement matrix. If e is the environmental parameter to be recorded, it is usually a"}, {"heading": "3 Some Applications", "text": "In this section, we describe two simulation-based validations of a limited version of the ASIN system, which we discussed in the last section. However, the limitation of the version of ASIN used is that the sensors used in this setup are general and will not be adapted for the final destination."}, {"heading": "3.1 ASIN based breast tumor detection", "text": "In the first demonstration, we use UWB-based radar to measure breast tumors. This is an active area of research [5, 6]. But most work in this area follows the conventional instrumentation path, as in Figure 1. The focus is on developing a generic instrument with high resolution. In the ASIN-based approach, we first set the end goal: We set the end goal to detect the tumor in the breast. Instead of generating a 3D image of breast tissue that requires the use of a UWB radar field, we used only one UWB sensor node. The correlation processor block in Figure 3 was simulated using a single-layer neural network that was initially trained with few training measurements (all using a single UWB sensor). The final system was able to detect the tumor with an accuracy of 98%, even in the presence of tissue bundles whose relative permitivity was much higher than that of normal tissue can be found in the rest of the 7."}, {"heading": "3.2 ASIN based sludge volume estimation", "text": "In a second attempt to implement an ASIN system, we tried to build an instrument using UWB radar to measure the sludge volume in oil tanks. An experimental setup is shown in Figure 4. Again, the conventional approach is to use an array of UWB transceiver sensor nodes to first create a 3D image of the basin floor and then to use image processing steps to estimate the sludge volume. In the ASIN-based approach, we first trained the correlator processor, also implemented by a single-layer neural network. In the test phase, we changed the sludge volume in incremental steps and for each volume, we also changed the sludge profile. The performance of the system is best represented by a regression coefficient between the actual volume and the estimated volume. We obtained a regression value of 0.91 using simulation-based experiments and 0.88 using practical measurements."}, {"heading": "4 Redefining Resolution", "text": "One of the most important features of any instrument system is its resolution. According to the Measurement Systems Analysis Manual, \"the resolution of an instrument is \u03b4 if the probability is equal that the specified value of an artifact that differs from a reference standard by less than \u03b4 is the same as the specified value of the reference value.\" There are few ways to refine this definition to create a new definition of resolution for ASIN. Depending on this, we will define two different types of resolutions."}, {"heading": "4.1 Neyman-Pearson Principle based Definition", "text": "Secondly, we measure this artifact using ASIN by using pattern recognition algorithms. Therefore, the output of ASIN is usually a probability, Pp, that a particular \"artifact of interest\" is present. Let's imagine the artifact of interest as an economy. For a given task, there will always be cases of misclassification that produce false alarm events that result in a probability of false presence, Pfp. Subsequently, the goal of disinfecting an ASIN is to maximize Pp for a given Pfp. Definition 4.1. The Neyman-Pearson Principle-based Resolution (\u03b4NP) can be defined as the maximum change in the artifact of interest that ensures for a given ASIN that the change in the probability of a false presence, namely Pfp, is an arbitrary number."}, {"heading": "4.2 Cramer-Rao Bound based Definition", "text": "From a data-centric point of view for an \"interesting artifact,\" \u03b8, we use the ASIN system to acquire a certain signal. One of the most important competence concepts of ASIN is the hypothesis that we can estimate \u03b8 even if the exact phenomenological linkage of \u03b8 to \u044b is not well modelled. In this way, the ASIN process can be considered in terms of parameter estimation. And in the parameter estimation, one of the important performance indicators is the Cramer-Rao Lower Limit (CRLB), which represents the least variance in the estimation. CRLB is the inversion of Fisher information2I (\u03b8) = E [(\u2202 l (\u0456; \u03b8).) 2], where l (\u0432; \u03b8) is the natural logarithm of the probability function and E is the expectation operation. For poorly defined mapping processes such as that we deal with in ASIN Fisher information, Fisher can be found numerically as well as [8] The cratharitharic function of probability 4.2 The expectation function."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Discussion", "text": "We propose a new type of instrumentation, which we call Application Specific Instrumentation (ASIN), a biologically inspired scheme that focuses on developing instruments for very focused problems that are focused so that the decision can be made binary. It is expected that the proposed scheme will be less costly, require much less computing and perform better for specialized applications. We have demonstrated the scheme in a limited sense for two applications using ultra-wide band radars. In both cases, we have shown that the end goal has been achieved with a single pair of transmitter receivers instead of an array. One of the important steps in the whole scheme is the design of the application-specific measurement matrix. We also present some modified definitions of resolution that can be used to quantify the performance of an ASIN system."}], "references": [{"title": "Implementation of an intelligent instrument for passive recognition and two-dimensional location estimation of acoustic targets", "author": ["G.
