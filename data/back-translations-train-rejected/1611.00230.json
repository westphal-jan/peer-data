Exploiting the characteristic of BTs, in terms of modularity and reactivity, the robot continually acts and plans to achieve a given goal using a set of abstract actions and conditions. The construction of the BT is based on an extension of the Hybrid Backward-Forward algorithm (HBF) that allows us to refine the acting process by mapping the descriptive models onto operational models of actions, thus integrating the ability of planning in infinite state space of HBF with the continuous modular reactive action execution of BTs. We believe that this might be a first step to address the recently raised open challenge in automated planning: the need of a hierarchical structure and a continuous online planning and acting framework. We prove the convergence of the proposed approach as well as the absence of deadlocks and livelocks, and we illustrate our approach in two different robotics scenarios.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 13:56:55 GMT  (4817kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00230v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["michele colledanchise", "diogo almeida", "petter \\\"ogren"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00230"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.00230.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Towards Blended Reactive Planning and Acting using Behavior Trees", "authors": ["Michele Colledanchise", "Diogo Almeida", "Petter \u00d6gren"], "emails": ["miccol@kth.se", "diogoa@kth.se", "petter@kth.se"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is a pure disinfectant, capable of suffocating itself."}, {"heading": "II.

The Algorithm Steps in Detail", "text": "In this case, the Refine Actions (algorithm 1 line 5) is always a new solution. If we plan in infinite space, we rely on the Reachability Graph (RG) provided by the HBF algorithm. [18] The RG provides efficient samples for the actions in the BT, so that we can classify the descriptive model of an action into its operational model. The examples provided by the RG are not involved in conflict with each other, and the process implements the action element described in [20]. [20] Get Condition To Expand Tree (algorithm 1 lines 9 and 10): If the BT return name subsequently does not conflict with others, the condition finds that the condition is executed in the search for failure in a breadth manner. If no such condition is found (algorithm 3 line 9 and 10), the condition is found to extend the condition, and the algorithm is found to return the action so that it is returned in an extended condition."}, {"heading": "C. Comments on Algorithm", "text": "It is clear that this type of continuous planning and action has both the important principles of reasoning that are emphasized in [1], [2]: hierarchically organized reasoning and continuous online reasoning. For example, if the robot drops the object, the condition h = c is no longer met and the BT will execute the corresponding sub-tree to select the object, with no need for rescheduling. This type of deliberate reactivity is built into BTs. On the other hand, if a new object occurs during its navigation that blocks the path of the robot, the condition for it will no longer be met and the BT will be expanded accordingly, as described in Example 2. Also, note that every time the tree fails, we refine it. This should include the case where an older refinement is no longer valid. If this is one case, an action will not succeed and the BT will be expanded accordingly. This failure will be continued to the root. The Expandree Tree function (line 10) will not return the next object (line 10)."}, {"heading": "D. Algorithm Execution on Graphs", "text": "(Example 3: Consider an agent moving in different states, modelled by the graph in Figure 8, where the initial state is s0 and the target state is sg. Each arc represents an action that moves an agent from one state to another. The action that moves the agent from a state si to a state sj is indicated by si \u2192 sj. The initial tree, represented in Figure 9 (a), is defined as a condition node sg that delivers success when and only when the robot is in state sg. The current state is s0 (the initial state), so the BT returns a failure. Algorithm 1 calls the BT expansion routine. The state sg can be achieved from state s5, by the action s5 \u2192 sg, still from state s3, or from state s3 \u2192 sg. The tree is expanded accordingly, as shown in Figure 9 (this sub)."}, {"heading": "VI. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS", "text": "In this section we will discuss the framework from a theoretical point of view. As we mix planning and action conditions, we would exclude the satisfaction of the first conditions from planning. As in [3], our correctness criterion is if there is a finite sequence of operations so that the target status can be reached from the initial state, then algorithm 1 will not perform such a sequence of operations. In a discrete range and without hierarchical refinements, a regression planner would produce a correct plan under assumption 3. (See Example 3). The authors of [3] prove that the refinements do not affect the ability to achieve the global goal. The correct plan of a regression planner would be executed by acting in FSM fashion. However, the implementing framework of our approach is represented by a BT. Thus, we must examine the effects of the use of BTs as a task execution framework."}, {"heading": "VII. RESULTS", "text": "In this section, we will show how the proposed approach can be applied to complex problems based on two different scenarios: First, a KUKA Youbot scenario, in which we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to dynamic and unpredictable environments, emphasizing the importance of continuous planning and action; second, an ABB Yumi Industrial Manipulator scenario, in which we highlight the applicability of our approach to real-world plans that require the execution of a long sequence of actions; and second, an ABB Yumi Industrial Manipulator scenario, in which we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real-world plans that require the execution of a long sequence of actions, performed using the physics simulator V-REP, internal implementations of low-level controllers for actions and conditions, and an open source BT library6. Figures 11 and 12 show the execution of two KUKA Youbot experiments and Figure 13 the execution of an ABB Yumi robot experiment.

KUKA Youbot experiments", "text": "In these scenarios, which are an extension of Examples 1 and 2, a KUKA Youbot must place a green cube on a goal surface, see Figures 11 and 12. The robot has a single arm with a simple parallel gripper. Additional objects can block the possible paths to the goal, and the robot must plan when to pick and where to place the obstructing objects. In addition, external actors in the scene can coexist and force the robot to reschedule by changing the environment (e.g. picking and placing).6http: / / wiki.ros.org / behavior _ tree 7https: / / youtu.be / b _ Ug2My9 _ Xw"}, {"heading": "B. ABB Yumi experiments", "text": "In these scenarios, an ABB Yumi must assemble a mobile phone whose parts are scattered on a table, see Figure 13. The robot is equipped with two arms with simple parallel grippers that are not suitable for skillful manipulation, and some parts must be held in a specific position. For example, the opening on the chassis of the mobile phone must be turned away from the arm of the robot and released for assembly. However, the starting position of one part may require multiple grips to transfer the part to the other gripper and effectively change its orientation. See video link above."}, {"heading": "VIII. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a framework that, to the best of our knowledge, automatically synthesizes a BT that fulfills a goal in the face of a series of abstract nodes of action and condition.The framework combines the advantages of BT in terms of modularity and reactivity with the infinite dimensional planning capability of the HBF algorithm, and the resulting approach is an attempt to address the challenges identified in the planning community in terms of mixing planning and action. We analyzed the framework from a theoretical standpoint and demonstrated its applicability in dynamic and unpredictable scenarios."}, {"heading": "IX. FUTURE WORK", "text": "We study the integration of this type of blended planning and acting with the learning of action templates. In particular, we are interested in learning the prerequisites and effects for each action useful for planning. Recent work [17] shows how BTs are suitable for enhanced learning. However, note that the challenges we face are slightly different from those addressed in [17]. We are not able to define an objective function that is maximized when the prerequisites are met. [17] Roughly speaking, we find a sufficient set of prerequisites for an action for a particular task. We will be interested in finding necessary and sufficient prerequisites for an action for each task. We believe that the modularity of BTs will allow us to learn individual parts of prerequisites and effects to characterize the action templates. The learning process could be monitored by a professional taking inspiration from [33], [34] or by interacting with the environment to characterize the preconditions for action."}, {"heading": "X.

Behavior Tree (BT), controlling a robot in a dynamic environment. Exploiting the characteristic of BTs, in terms of modularity and reactivity, the robot continually acts and plans to achieve a given goal using a set of abstract actions and conditions. The construction of the BT is based on an extension of the Hybrid Backward-Forward algorithm (HBF) that allows us to refine the acting process by mapping the descriptive models onto operational models of actions, thus integrating the ability of planning in infinite state space of HBF with the continuous modular reactive action execution of BTs. We believe that this might be a first step to address the recently raised open challenge in automated planning: the need of a hierarchical structure and a continuous online planning and acting framework. We prove the convergence of the proposed approach as well as the absence of deadlocks and livelocks, and we illustrate our approach with examples from two different robotics domains.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
