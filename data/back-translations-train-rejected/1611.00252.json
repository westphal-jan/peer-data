Introduction", "text": "Credit scoring models are often used by banks and other financial institutions to assess the risk of default by applicants for loans previously determined on the basis of case studies only. Credit scoring models take a vector of attributes for a borrower and try to distinguish between commodities and commodities based on these attributes; that is, between those who are likely to be insolvent or in default on their payments and those who are. A lender in New Zealand evaluates borrowers on the basis of 11 attributes derived from an application form that is filled out online when applying for a loan. The lender had recently begun to include data from an application called Credit Sense 1 in its data warehouse, which automatically extracts bank statement data for a 90-day issuance.The bank statement data is currently used for purposes such as credit verification. The company was interested in examining the potential of this data for credit scoring purposes."}, {"heading": "2.

Research Goals", "text": "The primary objectives of this study are the following: 1. Extract relevant features from the statement data, which is a non-trivial task, and potentially use these features to model credit risk.2. Construct the following basic models: \u2022 solely on the basis of the existing scoring feature set derived from the information declared on the application form. \u2022 exclusively on the basis of the feature set derived from account statements, the feature set derived from applicants via Credit Sense.3. Comparing the performance of the combined feature model (both the application form and the features derived from the statement) with the two basic models defined above. The main purpose of the performance comparison is to investigate whether the features derived from statements are sufficiently predictable for a credit rating model or to what extent the features derived from the statement can enhance the existing scoring model to enhance credit rating features."}, {"heading": "3.2. Methodology", "text": "For this project, a structured experimental approach to the data mining process was sought in order to increase the likelihood of achieving good outcomes. Knowledge discovery in database processes (KDP) outlines a formal experimental approach to extracting and creating knowledge from data. KDP is defined as the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately comprehensible patterns in data (Fayyad et al., 1996). KDP includes some input data, and in the end it comes out with some new knowledge that is valuable and useful for the organization.KDP frameworks were originally developed in science, and industry frameworks followed (Cios et al., 2007). Two models that are considered to be leading are Fayyad et al. (1996), which were developed from academic research, and the second is the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)."}, {"heading": "4.

Baseline Model with Bank Statement Derived Features", "text": "The AUC for each model, for the specific number of Derived Statement Features, is in Figure 3. Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression are the most powerful classifiers with Derived Statement Features. Random Forest and the closest Neighbor Classifier again performed similarly to each other. Comparing Figure 2 and Figure 3, we can conclude that the AUC values for the Candidate Models are significantly higher with the Feature Set of the Application Form than with the Characteristic Set of the Statement. From this, we can conclude that the lender should not develop a Credit Assessment Model solely with the Characteristics Derived from the Statement."}, {"heading": "4.2.3. Combined Feature Set Model", "text": "We have found that models perform better with the Application Form Set than with the Statement Feature. We are now investigating to what extent the features derived from the Statement can complement the existing Application Form Features to improve the AUC. Results with the Combined Feature Set are shown in Figure 4. We see that Naive Bayes is clearly the most powerful classifier within the Combined Feature Set. Naive Bayes Classifier reaches its highest AUC value (0.829) when 16 features are included in the model. Apparently, this feature set consists of all eleven existing application form features used by the lender, along with 5 of the new features derived from the Statement. 5.

Evaluating the Final Model", "text": "Specifically, we are now investigating whether the combined 16-function model Naive Bayes is superior to a Naive Bayes model based on the existing 11 features of the application form currently used by the lender for evaluation, which we can do by visually comparing the ROC curves for each model in the same target space.From Figure 5 (illustrated using the knowledge flow interface in WEKA), we can conclude that the ROC curve for the combined 16-function model is generally superior to the model for almost all targets except the orbiting regions. From this, we can conclude that the combined feature model has improved the model based solely on the 11 existing features, the 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 # FeaturesFigure 4: Comparison of AUC for each candidate model with the combined feature set from the application form, and therefore the model has been improved by the new features from the account statements."}, {"heading": "5.2. Cost Sensitive Classification", "text": "A cost matrix includes the cost of misclassifying a good as bad (false negative) and the cost of misclassifying a good as good. An estimate of these specific costs was not made in this study, but in any case, we can assume that the cost of misclassifying a good as bad is $1 and the cost of misclassifying a bad good as good x dollars; in this case, the cost of misclassifying a bad good as good x times as high as misclassifying a good as bad. Table 4 shows the accuracy, the TP rate, the number of goods among the 7401 total that were correctly classified, the TN rate, and the number of baths among the 121 total that were correctly classified by the combined 16-feature Naive Bayes model, for six different cost ratios. Note that if we increase the value of x, we can achieve a true negative value and move along the ROC curve, but at the cost of calculating the exact total amount of the required ROP and thus calculating the exact ROP for the interest rate."}, {"heading": "5.3. Bank Statement Derived Features", "text": "As already mentioned, in the final Model 5 there were features derived from the account statement data that proved to be useful to supplement the existing 11 features of the application form. Table 5 shows each of these features, containers and the weight of evidence (WOE) for each container. Note that the weight of evidence represents the natural logarithm of the ratio of good to evil within this attribute container (Siddiqi, 2012). As the features and their containers have been anonymized for confidentiality reasons, our full interpretation of the results in Table 5 cannot be given here. However, we can note that holding a Type 1 credit card is associated with good risk and not with Bank 1, which may reflect the customer quality of the customers who use these institutions."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "This research has supplemented features provided by credit applicants during the application process, and this work has highlighted the potential to use account statements from applications such as Credit Sense to provide additional features to enhance credit rating. Although the account statements themselves were not sufficiently predictable, our experimental results showed that a number of statements had value in supplementing the application forms to enhance a credit model. Specifically, we found that a Naive Bayes model, which had 16 combined features in the area below the ROC curve (AUC), had a value in supplementing the application forms, had a credit model."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "In this paper, we investigate the extent to which features derived from bank statements provided by loan applicants, and which are not declared on an application form, can enhance a credit scoring model for a New Zealand lending company.
