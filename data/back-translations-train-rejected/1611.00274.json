We propose a cognitive architecture for the detection of affordances in the visual modality. This model is based on the internal simulation of movement sequences. For each movement step, the resulting sensory state is predicted by a forward model, which in turn triggers the generation of a new (simulated) motor command by an inverse model.

Final affordance detection is based on the generated motor commands. We apply this model to a real-world mobile robot which is faced with obstacle arrangements some of which are passable (corridor) and some of which are not (dead ends). The robot's task is to detect the right affordance (\"pass-through-able\" or \"non-pass-through-able\"). The required internal models are acquired in a hierarchical training process.

Introspective experience suggests that humans are able to produce mental images, and neuroimaging studies have shown that these mental images in the corresponding cortical areas normally involved in visual and motor processing (Jeannerod, 2001; Kosslyn et al.) are a generally accepted function of mental images is the practice of movement tasks, e.g. in sports (Martin et al., 1999) or in rehabilitation (Jackson et al., 2001). We suggest that mental images - at the subconscious level - could be the basis for the recognition of affordability (Gibson, 1979) in visual perception. Affordability is the behavioral characteristics of beings in the environment of an agent; for example, \"they may be capable of\" rising. \""}, {"heading": "2 Setup and Image Processing", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Setup", "text": "The mobile robot in this study is based on the Pioneer 3DX platform. The mounted camera captures images from a mirror surface that reflects a full 360 \u00b0 view of the environment (Fig. 1). These images are unfolded to show a horizontal all-round view. Subsequently, the obstacles within an arrangement are detected by color segmentation and some filter rules (second row in Fig. 1). The obstacle colors are either yellow, green or red. The obstacles have a diameter of 40 cm (about the size of the robot) and a height of 30 cm. The obstacle arrangement can extend over an area up to a size of 3 x 4 m. Beyond this distance, the resolution of the camera is not sufficient to reliably identify an obstacle. An exemplary obstacle arrangement in our laboratory is located in the upper center of Fig. 1.The final sensor features are the width, horizontal position and vertical offset of each obstacle."}, {"heading": "2.2 Image Processing", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 General Processing", "text": "The camera images of the robot have a PAL resolution (720 x 576 pixels), are slightly denoted and are unfolded by a polar imaging on a horizontal panoramic view with a size of wIM x hIM pixels (with wIM = 1571 and hIM = 214). In this horizontal panoramic view, the obstacles are identified by a color segmentation based on saturation and hue in the HSV color space. During the segmentation, the left and right image columns are treated as if they were directly adjacent, i.e. the panoramic image is closed horizontally. All segments below the horizon are included in the set of detected obstacles with a minimum fill ratio (number of colored pixels divided by area of the delimiter box greater than 0.4) and with a minimum area (150 pixels)."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Correction of Sensory States", "text": "In theory, the upper part of the rear obstacle is fully visible, because the height of the obstacles has been chosen so that they appear completely below the horizon in the panoramic images. However, for distant objects, this is not always the case: if two obstacles are close to each other, the upper part of the rear obstacle could only cover a series of pixels that are easily destroyed during denoization and color segmentation. In such a case, the rear obstacle appears to be much slimmer than it is in reality, as illustrated in Figure 3. The red obstacle marked with an arrow appears much too small in the processed image. As the width of the obstacle is an important indicator of its distance from the robot, this is a fatal miscalculation. Therefore, we have included a correction step based on yi and hi, because these three parameters encode the distance between robot and obstacle in a red line."}, {"heading": "3 Computational Model", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Overview", "text": "The most important components of the computer architecture are adaptive forward-facing and inverse models (IM and IMs).The visual version predicts for each obstacle the change of its sensory state from the previous sensory state si, t and a motor command.The estimated new sensory version is calculated by s'i, t + 1. The general prediction s't + 1 is composed of the individual predictions.The visual version is obtained by collecting a large amount of training data from random movements of the robot with obstacles at different intervals. The tactile version with an obstacle is obtained by the individual predictions."}, {"heading": "3.2 Forward Models", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Visual Forward Model", "text": "For Visual FM, approximately 13,000 learning examples were collected in 120 random motion sequences with an average length of 55 steps. Distance between robot and obstacle and initial orientation of the robot were systematically varied between sequences, using a maximum number of two obstacles in each sequence. Each learning example has the structure [(si, t, mt) \u2212 \u2192 [si] with \u2206 si = si, t + 1 \u2212 si, t + 1 \u2212 si, t = 1 \u2212 si, t = 1, t = 1, t = 1, t = 2, t = 2, t = 1, t = 1 \u2212 si, t = 1. The forward motion training set consists of approximately 6300 learning examples, left rotations of approximately 3100 examples and right rotations of approximately 3600 examples. We tested various implementations for Visual FM (e.g. multi-shift perception; Rumelhart et al., 1986), but in the end, the best results were obtained by adapting analytical functions to the training data. For rotations, the output of Visual FM is constant."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Correction Step", "text": "Although visual FM predicts on average with good accuracy, it exhibits undesirable extrapolation behavior for distant obstacles near the horizon. To suppress this unnatural behavior, long-term simulations (see Figure 3.4) observe that such objects move away from the robot during forward motion and simultaneously grow larger. This correction is based on the linear model in (1), which represents the relationship between w and y for observed obstacles. If the relationship between w and y deviates from this model, this is a clear sign that predictions fall into an uncontrolled extrapolation range. To stop this extrapolation, w and y corrections are corrected by the linear model."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Tactile Forward Model", "text": "Since the robot lacks a tactile sensor, collisions are detected by estimating the distance of the obstacle to the visual data; if an obstacle is too close, it is interpreted as a collision. We have decided to define a virtual bumper ring around the robot with a diameter of 60 cm. At a distance of 30 cm from the center of the robot, obstacles with a width of 215 pixels appear in the panoramic image evaluations. For this reason, the tactile FM signals a collision if any prediction of the visual FM is greater than this value."}, {"heading": "3.3 Inverse Model", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Structure", "text": "As explained in paragraph 3.1, the IM decides on the motoric command mt: forward gear, q q qm = clockwise rotation. As input, it receives a variation of the panoramic view: All obstacles appear as white circles on a black background (uppermost image in fig. 6). Size and position of each circle depend on si, t. The generated image has a size of 197 x 42 pixels, hence the entered data space of the IM 8274 has dimensions. The IM has two distinct properties: It has to solve a triple classification task, and it receives a fairly high-dimensional input. For this reason, we have implemented it through a series of three binary classifiers, each of which is a simple linear model (due to the high dimensionality of the data, chances are good that a linear separation works well)."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Training", "text": "The conceptual role of IM in the cognitive architecture is to generate predictive obstacle avoidance behavior while staying on a straight track for as long as possible. \u03b2 To this end, the training data for IM is derived from an internal simulation process that uses the already-trained visual-tactile FM (for a detailed description see Mo \ufffd ller and Schenck, 2008, pp. 520). Short sequences of movements that proceed from a real image are simulated to find the sequence at minimal cost. Total costs of a sequence include collisions and motor costs. A sequence of collisions can never be those with minimal cost and is therefore discarded. The motor costs of a simulated sequence are determined by the sum of the cost of each movement in the sequence (forward 0, rotations 20), and the sum of costs when two consecutive movements deviate (10 when switching from translation to rotation or vice versa, 1000 when switching between rotations)."}, {"heading": "3.4 Internal Simulation", "text": "The ultimate goal of the cognitive architecture is to show by sensorimotor simulation whether an obstacle arrangement is \"continuous\" (corridor) or \"not continuous\" (dead end). A simulation study always starts from a real situation in which the agent recognizes the existing obstacles, leading to the original sensory state s0. Afterwards, the simulation is performed by iterative application of the IM and the visual and tactile state. IMs propose the next motor command, and the FMs predict the resulting new visual state s + 1 and the tactile state (see Fig. 7). Then, the next iteration begins based on the predicted visual state. In our experiments, the maximum number of iterations is 60. Whether an obstacle arrangement is \"continuously feasible\" is determined by the motor commands in the simulated sequence."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Task Conditions", "text": "In the final experiments, the overall architecture was tested in terms of its perceptual performance, i.e. its ability to distinguish dead ends from corridors through internal simulation. In these experiments, we systematically varied three aspects of the internal simulation process: (1) the type of IM; (2) the handling of oscillations (left curve followed by right curve followed by left curve...); (3) how to (re) start a simulation attempt."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Variations of the Inverse Model", "text": "We compared three different types of IMs: the IM as described in Section 3.3 with deterministic output (referred to as DET), a probabilistic interpretation of these IM (referred to as PROB) and a random walk (referred to as RANDOM). In the probabilistic version, the results of the three regression modules are interpreted as probabilities that the corresponding motor commands are the optimal choice. First, the mean (not yet normalized) probabilities are calculated: p value (mi, mj) = q value (mi, mj) \u00b7 q value (mi, mk) with i-value 6 = j, i-value 6 = j, j-value 6 = k; i-value of the mean (not yet normalized) probabilities are calculated: p value (mi, mj) \u00b7 q value (mi, mk) with i-value 6 = j, i-value of the fundamental probability, i-value 6 = k, j-value of the fundamental probability (PROM value)."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Anti\u2013Oscillation Mode", "text": "If an IM produces a turn that counteracts the turn immediately before, this leads to an impasse in the case of IM-DET and frequent violations of the corridor criterion in the case of IM-PROB and IM-RANDOM because the maximum number of allowed turns is exceeded faster. We tested four ways to counteract this problem (hereinafter referred to as anti-oscillation modes); in the first mode (NONE), no countermeasures are taken; in the second mode (FORWARD), we proceed as in the original study by Mo \ufffd ller and Schenck (2008): Whenever two consecutive turns cancel each other, the second turn is transformed into a turn in the same direction as the first. In the third mode (FORWARD), both turns are deleted from the motion sequence (the second turn dissolves the first turn; the predicted sensory state is kept consistent by executing the visual turn on the second turn."}, {"heading": "4.1.3 Restart Mode", "text": "If a simulation attempt is aborted because the motion sequence indicates a dead end, or because the maximum iteration depth is reached, a new attempt must be started. In the case of the \"FULL\" restart mode, the entire motion sequence of the previous attempt is discarded; the internal simulation starts again from zero. This works well with IMs with a probabilistic component, while IM-DET always generates the same motion sequence. However, for the sake of completeness, the combination of IM-DET with FULL was included in the experiments; the second restart mode comes from the original study by Mo \ufffd ller and Schenck (2008). In this mode, each motion sequence is identical to the one from the previous attempt up to a randomly selected step within the first two thirds of the sequence (hence, this mode is called PARTIAL). At this point, the new sequence is modified by running three consecutive rotations either to the left or to the right (random decision)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Experimental Procedure", "text": "In total, there were 24 task conditions (3 types of IMs x 4 anti-oscillation modes x 2 restart modes).In each task condition, we performed 600 simulation runs based on the robot's camera images of 60 different real obstacle arrangements; therefore, the image of each obstacle arrangement in each task condition is displayed ten times as a real starting state. 60 obstacle arrangements are divided into 20 dead ends and 40 corridors. Each of these 60 scenarios consists of 10 obstacles distributed over an area of about 3 x 4 meters (see Figs. 2 and 8 for some examples).The robot was placed near the entrance of each dead end or corridor situation. We made sure that in each of these 60 scenarios all obstacles were detected during the image processing phase (although certain characteristics such as their width may have been incorrectly perceived, see Fig. 3).Dead ends were arranged so that the maximum gap between the obstacles was 65 cm or two corridors."}, {"heading": "4.3 Results", "text": "For each task condition, we report on the success rates (correctly identified corridors and dead ends in Tab. 1), the average number of simulation attempts per pass with successful corridor recognition (Tab. 2), and the total number of FM calls across all 600 simulation runs (Tab. 3)."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Success Rates", "text": "The success rates in Tab. 1 show that the cognitive architecture is well suited to show the affinities of obstacle arrangements - at least in some task areas. Dead ends are almost always correctly classified, and corridor detection works well for IM-DET and IM-PROB when combined with the corresponding anti-oscillation mode (FORWARD / FORW.-CONTINUE). In these task conditions, the success rates for corridor detection are about 90%. The best result (91.3%) is the combination of IM-DET / FORW.-CONTINUE / PARTIAL. In comparison, the combination of IM- DET / CONTINUE / PARTIAL used by Mo-ller and Schenck is only 65.8%."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Average Number of Trials", "text": "The average number of attempts for successfully detected corridors in Tab. 2 clearly shows, however, that this is a premature conclusion. In the most precise task state FORWARD / FULL, IM-RANDOM requires an average of 8.56 simulation attempts, compared to about 4.5 required by IM-PROB and only about 2.5 by IM-DET! This convincingly proves that demanding IMs in general and the deterministic variant in particular are far superior to pure randomness."}, {"heading": "4.3.3 Average Number of FM Invocations", "text": "In addition, we analyzed the average number of FM calls across all 600 simulation runs (Tab. 3), which also reflects how costly it is to generate dead-end motion sequences. Again, the random walk is very expensive compared to the more complex IMs (3,698 calls for IM-RANDOM / FORWARD / FULL as opposed to 929 calls for IM-PROB / FORW.-CONTINUE / FULL and 686 calls for IM- DET / FORW.-CONTINUE / PARTIAL), which further confirms the impression that the success of random strategies depends on a large number of motion steps being tested, while sophisticated IMs are more efficient because their output is targeted. Generally, the anti-oscillation modes CONTINUE and FORW.-CONTINUE are the most economical, while FORWARD is the most efficient as opposed to the pure number of FM calls."}, {"heading": "4.3.4 Visualization", "text": "Fig. 8 illustrates the bird's eye view output of the different types of IMs for a cul-de-sac and three corridors. Granted, these examples were deliberately chosen by the authors, but they nevertheless show the different characteristics of the motion sequences generated. IM-RANDOM produces many different sequences within a simulation run covering a wide area, but more obvious outputs such as in the second row of images are overlooked. In contrast, IM-DET generates gently curved motion sequences, and sometimes even a single one is enough to find the passage through a corridor. IM-PROB's characteristics lie in between. In the third row, despite many attempts, it does not identify the passage, most likely because the probability of a right curve at the crucial point in the arrangement is far too low. Here, the random injection of three successive right turns by the PARTIAL strategy helps IM-DET to find the exit very quickly (of course, this is a coincidence)."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "This year, we will be in a position to retaliate in the next five years, in which we will be able to retaliate, to retaliate."}], "references": [{"title": "The proactive brain: Using analogies and associations to generate predictions", "author": ["M.

We propose a cognitive architecture for the detection of affordances in the visual modality. This model is based on the internal simulation of movement sequences. For each movement step, the resulting sensory state is predicted by a forward model, which in turn triggers the generation of a new (simulated) motor command by an inverse model. Thus, a series of mental images in the sensory and in the motor domain is evoked. Starting from a real sensory state, a large number of such sequences is simulated in parallel. Final affordance detection is based on the generated motor commands. We apply this model to a real\u2013world mobile robot which is faced with obstacle arrangements some of which are passable (corridor) and some of which are not (dead ends). The robot\u2019s task is to detect the right affordance (\u201cpass\u2013through\u2013able\u201d or \u201cnon\u2013pass\u2013through\u2013able\u201d). The required internal models are acquired in a hierarchical training process. Afterwards, the robotic agent is able to distinguish reliably between corridors and dead ends. This real\u2013world result enhances the validity of the proposed mental simulation approach. In addition, we compare several key factors in the simulation process regarding performance and efficiency.
