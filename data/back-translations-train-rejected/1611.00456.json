Among these papers are some studies on unsigned relationships, and recently researchers have been paying more attention to the analysis of signed relationships, in which the correlations are labeled to illustrate typical types such as positive and negative. The problem of predicting marginal signs in a social network was first identified by Guha et al. [13]. They developed a framework for the propagation of trust to predict trust (or mistrust) between the pairs of nodes. Many recent studies focused on positive / negative analysis [4, 6, 11]. Kunegis et al. [18] proved the added value of negative links in social networks. They also investigated the spectral properties of signed networks and utility cores derived from a signed variant of the Laplacian diagram for predicting links [19]. Brzozowski et al. [10] Random Walk algorithms applied to predict both positive and negative networks."}, {"heading": "2.2 Synthesis of Language Analysis & Social Network Analysis", "text": "In recent studies, these two technologies are often combined to understand the nature of social relationship, user profile, or social event. Adal\u0131 et al. [1] showed that the characteristics of social behavioral information and textual information are virtually equivalent in terms of their ability to determine the different types of relationships between individuals who interact on social media. Bramsen et al. [8] presented a textual corpus-based statistical learning approach to modeling social power relationships. Thomas et al. [25] and Tan et al. [26] took advantage of this insight, using an elaboration of Pang and Lee's graph-cut approach [23]. They are based on the assumption of more homophobic, i.e., disciplinary, linking certain social relationships to agreement on specific issues: Thomas et al et al et al. [25] used party affiliations and mentions in speeches to predict electoral patterns, and Tal et al [26] are interdisciplinary relationships between people, rather than mentioners."}, {"heading": "3. CHARACTERIZE OPINIONS ON INTERRELATIONSHIP WITH INTERACTIVE LANGUAGE FEATURES", "text": "In recent studies, when researchers want to measure the strength or type (e.g. positive & negative) of social interaction between two individuals from an objective point of view, they often turn to typical objective characteristics, such as embedding the interrelation or frequency of communication between the participants. Results of such methods are often symmetrical, i.e., independent of the direction of the interrelation. If we assume that the properties of the interrelation are not symmetrical, i.e. different for two directions, it is often caused by the difference in the opinions of the two participants. Therefore, how can we describe the opinions of the individuals about their interaction asymmetrically? Some studies choose two objective characteristics, i.e. the frequency of communication in two directions. Although some objective characteristics can be used asymmetrically, they cannot accurately describe the opinions. Therefore, a more reasonable solution is to measure the opinions about the interrelation to subjective realities."}, {"heading": "3.1 Objective Features for Interrelationship", "text": "Most popular objective characteristics for measuring social relationships are the embedding of a correlation and the frequency of communication between two participants. Embedding can measure the strength of a correlation with the degree of randomness of the correlation between two participants, i.e. the number of common \"friends\" in many cases. Embedding is an effective objective characteristic that describes the correlation only with the structure of the social network, but is not designed to be measured directly. Frequency of communication can measure the strength of a correlation with the frequency of certain types of communication between two participants. Among the most commonly used cases are the frequency of phone calls, emails and mutual comments on social media. Frequency of communication is not an absolute objective characteristic, because it is actually a type of behavior of the participants and a subjective decision. Although the subjective characteristic of communication frequency leads to the correlation mirroring of communication, it can only reflect opinions in a channel way."}, {"heading": "3.2 Sociolinguistics and Subjective Features", "text": "Subjective characteristics are the characteristics that can reveal the subjective opinion of the participants about their interactions. In sociolinguistics, the theory of communicative action [14] is proposed to reconstruct the concept of the relationship to the communicative act, instead of objective terms. And the linguistic structures of communication can be used to establish a normative understanding of social relations. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis [24] also assumes that the semantic structure of language with forms or boundaries is the way in which a speaker occupies the world, including social relations. In communication, the choice of words will always depend heavily on their subjective views about their interaction with others. These theories inspire us to form the opinion about an interrelation between languages."}, {"heading": "3.3 Distinguish the Asymmetry of Opinions from the Asymmetry of Language Habits", "text": "Although the interactive language style of the individual is closely related to his views on his personal relationships, it is inaccurate to directly understand opinions based on the original interactive language characteristics (in the understanding of natural language, the meaning of language is always determined not only by the content, but also by the context).The context of interactive language is very complex, including the language habits of the speaker, the opportunity for dialogue, sentences in the same discourse, etc. In this work, we focus on how to better understand one's own opinion in relation to the others. Suppose A is a very negative person, and he always speaks to person B with a negative polarity score. But we also know that A speaks to each person very negatively and he speaks to B most kindly in relation to the others. In this case, if we want to properly measure the opinion of A in relation to his relationship with B, we use the polarity of the language that I use relative to A in relation to the original language."}, {"heading": "4. MEASURE THE ASYMMETRIC OPINIONS ON INTERRELATIONSHIP WITH SYNTHETIZED FEATURES", "text": "In this section, we formulate a mathematical model for measuring the bidirectional degree of asymmetric opinions of individuals about their interrelations.

The assumption is that in a social triangle, the opinions of two individuals about the third are all the more positive, and vice versa. When we sign interactions with undirected binary signs \"+\" and \"-,\" we are talking about statements about the edge signs of triangles according to the toweight theory: Given the signs of two edges, the equilibrium theory predicts the third, as summarized in Figure 1 (a), with the two given edges (grey) determining the third (black).

For each individual, we calculate the standard deviation of their interactive language characteristics in relation to different communicators, indicating the range of their language style, i.e., we have the average of all personal deviations and the global deviation of the language characteristics of all individuals. \"The results show that the average deviation of personal language characteristics in relation to different communicators (column 2) is significantly smaller than the column (column 1), indicating that the column indicates that we have the average of all personal deviations and the global deviation of the language characteristics of all individuals compared to each other."}, {"heading": "5.5 The Role of Personality Traits", "text": "In this experiment, we further tried to investigate possible latent reasons for the asymmetry of opinions in relation to social relationships. We focus on the personality traits of the individual. Here, we look at two types of personality traits: the positive degree and the flexible degree of personality. An individual with a higher positive degree means that he adopts a more positive attitude in social relationships, and a higher flexible degree means that his social behaviour is more changeable rather than adhering to a fixed style. We also assumed that the positive degree of an individual can be measured by his linguistic characteristics, i.e. a higher positive degree can be indicated by higher values of frequency, length, quality and sensation. We also assumed that the flexible degree can be measured by the standard deviation of his linguistic characteristics, i.e., a higher flexible degree can be indicated by greater deviation of the linguistic characteristics. With the above assumption, we selected the better interdependence values I / higher with the highest linguistic correlation, such as the upper 10 / highest relates individuals with the last W10."}, {"heading": "6.

The threshold is intended to slightly adjust the result. An excessively high threshold brings unnecessary manual influences to the modeling. In comparison, the results measured by individual language characteristics are characterized by the names of the characteristics, i.e. \"frequency,\" \"quantity\" and \"sentiment.\" All synchronization structures are characterized by the synthesis of the characteristics (3)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Visualization of Asymmetric Opinions on Interrelationship", "text": "In addition, Figure 4 illustrates the asymmetric views of individual selected Enron e-mail users on correlations. The thickness of the edges illustrates the property value in each direction of the interactions. Therefore, the asymmetry of opinions can be illustrated by the difference in the thickness of the two edges between the node pairs. Figure 4 illustrates the visualization of four interactive linguistic characteristics each. Figure 4 shows that the asymmetry of the property values, i.e. the difference in thickness of the edge pairs between the nodes, is frequent and significant. Another interesting observation is that the degree of asymmetry between the \"distant\" individual pairs, i.e. the pairs far from the center of the node communities, seems to be more significant."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this work, we investigated and measured the asymmetry of individuals \"opinions about social interactions using interactive language traits. According to sociolinguistic theories, we used four key language traits to represent their own interactive language style, including frequency, length, quality, and sentiment.As a case study, we used these traits to examine individuals\" opinions about interactions with their email content in the Enron dataset. Experimental results showed that the asymmetry of individual language styles is a common effect of the asymmetry of their opinions and the asymmetry of their language habits. We also found that individuals \"personality traits can be a latent cause of their asymmetric opinions about interactions: positive and flexible personality can alleviate the asymmetry of opinions about interactions. We further developed a model that synthesized interactive language and social network traits to jointly measure the concrete degree of asymmetric opinions about social interactions."}, {"heading": "8.

Eliminating the difference of personal language style, we clarify that the asymmetry of interactive language feature values can indicate individuals\u2019 asymmetric opinions on their interrelationship. We also discuss how the degree of opinions\u2019 asymmetry is related to the individual\u2019s personality traits. Furthermore, to measure the individuals\u2019 asymmetric opinions on interrelationship concretely, we develop a novel model synthetizing interactive language and social network features.
