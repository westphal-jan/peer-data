INTRODUCTION", "text": "The model of interrelation is fundamental to many related studies such as community discovery, influence analysis, link prediction and recommendation. [2] There are two primary options for determining the nature of an interrelationship: the first is to model the interrelationship from an objective point of view, which assumes that the characteristics of interrelations can be studied independently of the subjective opinions of the participating individuals; the second assumes that the characteristics of interrelations are subjective, which should be determined by examining the opinion of each individual about their interrelations; the model of interrelations based on these two strategies may be different; for an interrelation, the objective principle of each property often assigns a single value that is symmetrical on both sides of the interrelation. While the subjective principle naturally results in an asymmetrical measurement of the interrelation properties, the two individuals may have different opinions about their interrelations."}, {"heading": "1.1 Language and Network Features in Social Network Analysis", "text": "In addition to the emergence of more and more research on natural language processing and signed social networks, researchers are trying to combine these two technologies to examine the nature of social relationships in recent studies. Adal\u0131 et al. [1] concluded from measuring the ability of social behavioral and textual information to determine the different types of relationships that these information relationships were virtually equivalent between the pairs of interactions of individuals on social media. Pang and Lee's approach [10] extended the model of textual corpus-based statistical learning proposed by Bramsen et al. [4] Theirimprovement was inspired by the assumption of homophobia, i.e. certain social relationships correlate with agreement on certain issues. Thomas et al. [12] predicted electoral patterns by showing party affiliation and what had been mentioned in speeches, and Tan et al. [13] predicted attitudes about political and social events through the use of Twitter in the same way."}, {"heading": "1.2 Asymmetric Measurement of Social Interrelationship", "text": "Although the symmetrical model is most commonly studied in social relationships, there are also some recent studies that analyze social relationships in a directional or asymmetrical way. For directed relationships, Leskovec et al. [9] initially considered an explicit formulation of the predictive problem of signs. The predictive methods are based on the theory of social equilibrium and status. Bach et al. [3] and Huang et al. [7] shaped the prediction of signs as a hinge-loss-Markov random field, a kind of probabilistic graphic model introduced by Broecheler et al. [5]. West et al. [15] developed a model that synthesizes textual and social network information to jointly predict the polarity of person-operson evaluations. Wang et al. [14] investigated the subjective asymmetry of interaction with interactive language characteristics."}, {"heading": "1.3 Our Approaches", "text": "In previous work, the researchers proposed to model the asymmetrical opinions of the two individuals about their interaction with interactive language characteristics. However, current studies do not sufficiently investigate the intrinsic causes of asymmetrical opinions about interrelations and do not fully use the topological information from the social network to explain opinions about interrelations. In this paper, we focus on the factors that cause the asymmetrical opinions of individuals about interrelations. If the opinions of individuals depend only on their own subjective ideas, then we can measure their opinions only with subjective characteristics, such as the characteristics of interactive language. Intuitively, the opinion of an individual about one of his social relations is determined not only by his own ideas, but also by other relationships or individuals who are related to him in the social network. Therefore, in this essay, we try to insert a single interrelation into the social network context in order to investigate the correlation between the opinions of individuals and the social network characteristics."}, {"heading": "2. CHARACTERIZE ASYMMETRIC OPINIONS ON INTERRELATIONSHIP", "text": "WITH INTERACTIVE LONG-GUAGEFEATURES In current studies, most research aims to examine the strength or type (e.g. positive & negative) of the social relationship between two individuals from an objective point of view by measuring the objective characteristics, e.g. the frequency of communication between participants and the embedding of the correlation. On this basis, some research uses directed objective characteristics, e.g. the bidirectional frequency of communication between two participants. However, it is still difficult to accurately describe subjective opinions based on directed objective characteristics. Therefore, it is a new trend to combine subjective and objective characteristics to model social relations, especially from a subjective point of view. In addition to research on subjective characteristics, researchers find that interactive language is a good choice to obtain subjective characteristics of the correlation, since interactive language is not only closely related to the characteristics of the correlation, but also very well described in the following section of the individual opinions]."}, {"heading": "2.1 Objective Features of Interrelationship", "text": "The most commonly used objective characteristic of social relationships are the topological characteristics of the social network. Among the characteristics of social networks, the embedding of correlations and the frequency of communication between the participants are two most popular objective characteristics for measuring social relationships. Embedding is a characteristic that can measure the strength of a correlation with the randomness of the correlations between two people, i.e. the counting of the common \"friends\" of the two participants. Embedding has proven to be an effective objective characteristic that describes the strength of correlations, but is not designed to be directed. The frequency of certain types of communication between the two participants is also used to represent the strength of a correlation in many studies."}, {"heading": "2.2 Sociolinguistics and Subjective Features", "text": "The subjective characteristic can reveal the participants \"views of their interdependence, and based on this, the theory of communicative action [6] in sociolinguistics can be proposed to reconstruct the concept of relationship with communicative action rather than objectivist information, so that we can use the linguistic structures of communication to understand social relations more normatively. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis [11] also assumes that the semantic structure of language use shapes the way in which a speaker forms concepts of the world, including social relations. Individual choices of words in communication were highly related to their interdependence."}, {"heading": "2.3 Distinguish the Opinions and Language Habits in Interactive Language Style", "text": "Although the characteristics of interactive language are closely related to the views of the individual on the relationship between man and man, it is still difficult to understand opinions precisely with the original value of the linguistic characteristics, because in understanding natural language, the true meaning of a sentence is always determined not only by the sentence itself, but also by the context. The context of interactive language is so complex, including dialogue, the habit of the speaker, sentences in the same discourse, etc. In this work, we focus on the linguistic habit of the individual and its influence on the understanding of his interactive language. The meaning of a speaker's language is intuitively related to his linguistic habit, for example, a negative person who speaks very negatively to every person. We also know that A speaks to another person with negative emotional polarity, but A to B is friendliest compared to the others. In this case, if we want to measure the opinion of the speaker with his relationship to B correctly with the polarity of feeling, we must avoid interfering with the language."}, {"heading": "3. STRUCTURAL FACTORS RELATED", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "TO THE ASYMMETRIC OPINIONS ON", "text": "SOCIAL INTERRELATION As mentioned in Section 1.3, in practice, an individual is always not only involved in a single social relationship; his or her opinion of an interrelationship is often influenced by the social network context in which he or she is embedded. Here, the context is mainly presented as structural characteristics, such as other interrelations and neighboring nodes of that individual. In this section, we place a single interrelationship in the social network to examine the correlation between the interactive language characteristics and the social network characteristics of an interrelation. We focus on three typical structural characteristics: nodal characteristics, relationship characteristics and the characteristics of a multiple relationship unit (triadic termination of relationships)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Degree and Clustering Coefficient of Individuals", "text": "First, we focus on the structural characteristics of individuals, i.e. vertexes in social networks. Degree and cluster coefficient are two typical characteristics that are widely used in studies on social networks. In relation to a vertex A, degree A is defined in this work as the number of vertexes associated with A. The cluster coefficient can indicate the range of a person's social relationships; the cluster coefficient is also known as the quotient of the number of edges between the vertexes associated with A divided by the vertex pairs associated with A. The cluster coefficient indicates the probability that two friends of A are also friends in social networks. It is also known as an indicator for measuring A's ability to assemble friends in a cluster. Suppose that the degree of A is n and the number of edges between these n vertexes is k. Then the cluster coefficient C (A) of A can be calculated with formula (3):"}, {"heading": "3.2 Embeddedness of Interrelationships", "text": "Secondly, we focus on the structural characteristic of a single interrelation, i.e. a single edge in the social network. A typical structural characteristic of a single interrelation is embedding. Embedding is the number of common vertexes associated with the two endpoints of an edge. It means the number of common friends of two people involved in a reciprocal relationship. Embedding is considered a good indicator of the strength of social relationships. In this work, we assume that the embedding is also related to the degree of asymmetry of opinion about the interrelation. This assumption is based on the similar idea of measuring the strength of social relationships: it is generally accepted that more frequent friends indicate that two people are more closely connected to each other. In this work, we assume that more frequent friends can also make the opinions of two people about their interrelation more symmetrical. In this work, this assumption is also examined by the correlation analysis between the embedding and the asymmetry of individual opinions based on interactive linguistic characteristics."}, {"heading": "3.3 The Balance of Interrelationship Triadic Closure", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 The traditional balance theory", "text": "Thirdly, we focus on the structural characteristic of a basic social unit, consisting of multiple interrelations, i.e. triadic closure. The triadic closure consists of any three vertexes and edges between them, i.e. three arbitrary persons and the interrelation between them. In traditional equilibrium theory, each social relationship is given the binary keyword \"+\" or \"-,\" indicating a positive or negative relationship. In binary signs, there are four different combinations of signs for a triadic closure. Equilibrium theory claims that two of them are balanced and the other two are unbalanced, as Figure 1. The balanced triadic closures are stable, while the unbalanced ones tend to change in order to become balanced. Triangles, while the other two are unbalanced. In fact, the traditional equilibrium theory can be explained by the concept of homogeneity."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Our extension of the balance theory", "text": "The homogeneity in the previous section extends to the traditional equilibrium theory from binary s igns to continuous values. Furthermore, this explanation can also extend the traditional equilibrium theory of undirected relationships to direct action because it describes the equilibrium with the opinion of the individual rather than the objective type. The idea is that the polarity of an interaction is related to the homogeneity (mutual friends) of the traditional equilibrium theory. To be precise, we need to analyze the consistency of the traditional equilibrium theory."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In the experiments, we used Enron's e-mail dataset to investigate the correlation between the proposed typical characteristics of social networks and the asymmetry of opinions about correlations."}, {"heading": "4.1 Dataset", "text": "In the experiments, we used the Enron e-mail dataset of the CMU version (May 7, 2015) 1, which contains 0.5 million e-mail data exchanged between 151 Enron employees. We chose this dataset because it contains both the interactive language content (e-mail content) and the social network (sending and receiving relationships). We filtered the e-mail data of the users whose e-mail addresses are followed by @ enron.com. There are about 0.2 M1 http: / / www.cs.cmu.edu / ~ enron / user pairs who send / receive each other e-mails indicating the interactions between the two users. To make the investigation more reliable, we only maintained those interrelations in which at least 15 e-mails were sent in each direction. The filtered dataset contains 1078 interactions between 647 individuals."}, {"heading": "4.2 Language Features Extraction", "text": "For each pair of persons ordered < Ii, Ij > in the e-mail record, we calculate four language characteristics with the content of the e-mails from Ii to Ij: 1. To calculate the characteristic \"Frequency,\" we assume that the number of e-mails sent from Ii to Ij is N and the sending date of the first and last e-mail is t1 or t2. Then, the language characteristic \"Frequency\" can be calculated by formula (4): \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\""}, {"heading": "4.3 Vertex Factors vs. Language Features", "text": "In the first experiment, we will examine the correlation between the structural characteristics of vertexes in social networks and the asymmetry of perceptions of relationships measured by the four linguistic characteristics; the two structural characteristics of the vertexes presented in Section 3.1 will be investigated: degree and cluster coefficient."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Degree vs. Language features", "text": "In the first experiment, we first calculated the degree of each vertex by counting the number of vertexes associated with it. Then, we designated each directed edge with the value of four language characteristics. For each vertex A, we calculated the average of the degree of asymmetry on all vertex of A for each language characteristic. The degree of asymmetry on an interrelation is the degree of the bidirectional value differences of a certain language characteristic.

The average asymmetry of I is calculated by formula (8)."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Clustering coefficient vs. Language features", "text": "In the second experiment, we calculated for each vertex the cluster coefficient of each vertex according to formula (3) in section 3.1, as well as the average of the degree of asymmetry for the universal relations of A for each language trait. Then, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the cluster coefficient of vertexes and the average degree of asymmetry for each language trait. The results are shown in the second column in Table 1. Then, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the cluster coefficient of vertexes and its average degree of asymmetry for each language trait. The results are shown in the second column in Table 1. Figure 4 illustrates the correlation curves of four language characteristics, where the abscissa is the cluster coefficient of vertexes and the ordinates the average degree of asymmetry."}, {"heading": "4.3.3 Observations", "text": "We have some initial observations from section 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 of the statistical results. In the experiment with the degree of vertexes, the degree of asymmetry of \"length\" and \"feeling\" correlate relative to the degree of vertexes, and the other two characteristics do not exhibit a significant correlation. This suggests that a more sociable person, i.e. a person with more friends, could be more active to satisfy the opinions of partners in social contexts, i.e., they have a lower degree of asymmetry on relationships, which is reflected in particular in the intensity (length) and sensitivity tendency (sensitivity tendency). Although \"length\" and \"feeling\" in the experiment of the cluster coefficient also exhibit a relatively higher correlation, the absolute values are too low, so we do not believe that there is a correlation between the cluster coefficient and the average degree of asymmetry of vertexes to any linguistic trait in this case. Furthermore, the possible correlation between the frequency of the email and the lower frequency of the individual is always a possible explanation of the E-mail."}, {"heading": "4.4 Edge Factors vs. Language Features", "text": "In the next experiment, we will examine the correlation between the structural features of a single social network correlation and the asymmetry of opinions about the correlation, which is also measured by linguistic characteristics. We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the embedding of the edges and the asymmetry level between the two endpoints of the edges for each linguistic characteristic. Results are shown in Table 2. Figure 5 illustrates the correlation curves of four language characteristics, with the abscess being the common number (embedding) of the edges, and the ordinate being the average asymmetry deterioration. As the results show, the embedding of the correlations exhibit a high negative correlation with the average asymmetry level of all four linguistic characteristics. This suggests that when two individuals have more common friends, the asymmetry of their opinions about their correlation is weaker, i.e. they have more similar opinions about their correlation. This result may also represent an important extension of the traditional tripartite relationship between them and their traditional tripartite relationship."}, {"heading": "4.5 Balance Theory vs. Language Features", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.5.1 The verification of traditional balance theory", "text": "In the last round of the competition, we then have a very good result."}, {"heading": "4.5.2 The verification of extended balance theory", "text": "Based on the extension of the traditional equilibrium theory in Section 3.3.2, we examine whether the equilibrium assumption in the extended equilibrium theory is still correct. In the extended equilibrium theory, a triadic conclusion is drawn when the difference to the third parties and the difference to the third parties is reached. In the advanced equilibrium theory, the difference becomes greater than the difference to the third parties. \"We assume that the difference to the third parties is\" significant. \""}, {"heading": "4.6 Visualization of Enron Social Network", "text": "In addition, in Figure 8 and 9, we offer a visualization of the asymmetric opinions and balanced triangles in a part of the Enron social network. Each node is an e-mail user and the pair of edges between two nodes are their directed interactions. The size of a node indicates the degree of the node. The thickness of the edges illustrates the value of the language properties in each direction of the interactions. Therefore, the asymmetry of opinions can be illustrated by the difference in the thickness of the two edges between each pair of nodes. In addition, the balanced triangles in both figures are colored red. Figure 8 and 9 show the colored results through the traditional equilibrium theory and advanced equilibrium theory, respectively through the visualization of the social network in Figure 8 and 9 support our above conclusions in an intuitive way."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we investigated whether the structural contextual characteristics in the online social network are latent factors in the asymmetrical views of the individual about his or her interrelation. We characterized the bidirectional views of the individual about interactions with his or her interactive language characteristics in accordance with the existing method. As a case study, we analyzed the correlations between multiple structural contextual characteristics and the degree of asymmetry of opinion using the Enron e-mail dataset. The structural characteristics studied include the degree and cluster coefficient of texts, the embedding of edges and the equilibrium of the Triadic closeness. During the study, we also made an expansion of the traditional equilibrium theory to accommodate the form of asymmetrical views. With the Enron e-mail study, we found that some structural contextual characteristics in the social network may interact with the third person's more asymmetrical views of the individual's interpersonal relationship with his or her / his / her social interaction theory."}, {"heading": "6.
