Producing consistent evaluations of the performance of the many link prediction algorithms being proposed can be challenging due to variable graph properties, such as size and density. In this paper we first discuss traditional data mining solutions which are applicable to link prediction evaluation, arguing about their capacity for producing faithful and useful evaluations. We also introduce an innovative modification to a traditional evaluation methodology with the goal of adapting it to the problem of evaluating link prediction algorithms when applied to large graphs, by tackling the problem of class imbalance. We empirically evaluate the proposed methodology and, building on these findings, make a case for its importance on the evaluation of large-scale graph processing.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 11:07:51 GMT  (854kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00547v1", "Submitted to the Journal of Complex Networks. 15 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 25 Nov 2016 08:52:02 GMT  (854kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00547v2", "Submitted to New Generation Computing, 15 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to the Journal of Complex Networks. 15 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["dario garcia-gasulla", "eduard ayguad\\'e", "jes\\'us labarta", "ulises cort\\'es"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00547"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.00547.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Limitations and Alternatives for the Evaluation of Large-scale Link Prediction", "authors": [], "emails": ["dario.garcia@bsc.es"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "2 Evaluation context", "text": "The particularities of these algorithms have their origin in the particular nature of networks, particularities that include data dimensionality, variable dependence, and often log-scale distribution of information. Even with these differences, analogies can be found between graph-mining problems and general data-mining problems. From a traditional data-mining perspective, LP can be reduced to a binary classification problem between two classes: the positive class of edges that exist or should exist, and the negative class of edges that do not exist and should not exist. In the face of a directed graph G = (N, E) and all possible edges in the graph (the size | N-1 (N-1) |), the problem of LP would be to distinguish between the existing edges, e-E, and those that do not exist, e / E. The analogy between LP and binary classification is in most cases precise, since the goal of LP is often to identify the problem."}, {"heading": "2.1 Test Sets", "text": "In order to evaluate a binary classifier empirically, we need a test set. In the face of a chart, LP algorithms can suggest a number of edges that need to be added to confirm the quality of these suggestions, but we need a set of edges that are known to be correct and missing from the chart. In the evaluation, any predicted edge found in the test set is considered a correct prediction, while any unfound edge is considered an error. From these results, performance indicators such as precision and callback can be obtained. However, the main problem with test sets is how to obtain them. In the case of LP, the best test set that can be used is a natural extension of the chart that is calculated. This is feasible on temporally grounded domains. For a chart composed of Wikipedia articles and the hyperlinks among them from 2012, we can get a natural set of edges that we have added to Wikipedia's problems [unfortunately, the links to Wikipedia have been included in 2012]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Class imbalance", "text": "A recurring type of graphics of the real world are scale-free networks, from protein interactions to social networks or the WWW [barabasi2009scale], a type of network in which the distribution of degrees follows a law of power. This distribution implies a significant scarcity in the graph [del2011all], which becomes more difficult as the graph grows. Indeed, it is difficult to find real networks in which the average vertex degree is over fifty ([2, 32, 34]), a trait that even when graphics grow to billions of depressions ([44]). In connection with the reduction of the LP problem to a binary classification problem, scale-free networks lead to a severe class imbalance as the negative class becomes much larger compared to the positive class."}, {"heading": "2.3 Evaluation under class imbalance", "text": "This year, it will be able to fix and fix the mentioned bugs."}, {"heading": "3 Evaluating link prediction", "text": "Current solutions to performance evaluation, as outlined in \u00a7 2, have severe limitations when applied to large graph mining problems. Problems such as the representativeness of test sets or the evaluation under class imbalances reach a new level of relevance when problems such as LP are considered in large networks. In this section, we discuss these problems in detail and suggest solutions that fit our LP problem."}, {"heading": "3.1 Representativeness of test sets", "text": "The use of a test set to evaluate LP implies the assumption that the test set (the prediction is evaluated by the curves) faithfully represents the correct edges from the graph, or in other words that all edges found neither in the graph nor in the test set are false. In certain cases, where the graph topology is stable, it can be an imperfect measurement of the right edge (as shown in [14], it can be considered near-perfect."}, {"heading": "3.2 10-fold CV", "text": "10x CV is a commonly used technique for reducing variance in the construction of test sets and improving representativeness. Although the 10x CV is almost universally expected when using test sets that are a random part of a full set of data, we argue that it is not needed when performing large graph mining, the main reason behind this argument is the large size of these domains, which naturally avoid variance. To assess the usefulness of a 10x CV, we are testing a web graph that consists of a Google challenge composed of 875,713 vertices and 5,105,039 edges. This particular graph could be considered medium sized as it finds much larger ones (see Table 1). The conclusions obtained for this graph could be expanded with even greater reliability to visualize larger graphs.A 10x random test set of the Google challenge web graph consists of 10.5501, as it has much larger edges (see Table 501)."}, {"heading": "AA 0.0892558 0.0899991 0.08971357 0.0002287783", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CN 0.10017 0.10083 0.1005145 0.0001902058", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "RA 0.0618143 0.0625483 0.06225763 0.0002040158", "text": "Regardless of these results, performing a 10x CV is not a false or misleading strategy. Our argument here is that a 10x CV is not necessary to consider some results as representative, a fact that is particularly relevant due to the computational cost of calculating large-area charts. Building test sets and executing graph-mining algorithms on them is usually mathematically expensive, so the physical resources and time spent on ten equivalent versions could be used more efficiently elsewhere."}, {"heading": "3.3 Precision-Recall curves in link prediction", "text": "Most LP research uses ROC curves ([8, 12, 34, 35, 39]) or PR curves ([2, 41]) for evaluation, but for the reasons mentioned in \u00a7 2.3 we consider PR curves to be more appropriate. PR curves show the performance of a classifier at various thresholds: at the left part of the curve are the high-security predictions, where the accuracy is higher, while at the right part of the curve predictions are made with low certainty, where the callback increases at the expense of lower precision. By using the PR curve, we can see which classifier performs better at each threshold. On the other hand, the derived AUPR measurement of the PR curve determines which classifier performs better overall when all thresholds are considered at the same time with the same importance. On the basis of this last point, we find that the AUPR score is suboptimal for evaluating the applicability of the results. Given the imbalance of the graphs used (see Table 1), we should not be able to represent a high-precision part of the curve with a very low level of precision."}, {"heading": "4 Constrained AUC", "text": "The aim of classical binary classification is to make a complete distinction between the two sets. In this context, the complete differentiation of the two classes is considered unnecessary, which in turn affects the usefulness of the results obtained. Valuation methods are not oriented towards the actual usefulness of the results, but towards the fact that the results are useless."}, {"heading": "4.1 CAUPR properties", "text": "The goal of CAUPR performance is to avoid the evaluation of irrelevant parts of the PR curve. To this end, CAUPR defines a threshold at which a particular algorithm accepts more wrong positions than edges in the chart. PR curves take into account the maximum recall of an algorithm before it reaches the threshold and divide the PR curve into two parts. The PR subcurve in the on-demand interval [0, x] will take into account the one CAUPR curve, while the PR subcurve will be in the on-demand interval."}, {"heading": "4.2 CAUPR impact", "text": "In order to get a grip on the effects of climate change, the EU Commission must be able to take the necessary measures."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no proposals for adapting the standard evaluation methods (i.e. PR curves) to the specifics of large-scale LP. Solutions similar to ours (the use of a sub-range of the PR curve) have already been considered for ROC curves in other contexts, particularly in the field of diagnostic medicine, where several authors have considered the possibility of using only a partial ROC curve [36, 52]. In this area, the metrics used to cut the ROC curve are often clinical relevance and clinical application."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this project is a project which is, first and foremost, a project."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work is partially supported by the Joint Study Agreement No. W156463 under the IBM / BSC Deep Learning Center Agreement, by the Spanish Government through Programa Severo Ochoa (SEV2015-0493), by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology through the TIN2015-65316-P project and by the Generalitat de Catalunya (Contracts 2014-SGR-1051)."}], "references": [{"title": "Friends and neighbors on the web", "author": ["Lada A Adamic", "Eytan Adar"], "venue": "Social networks", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2003}, {"title": "A framework for dynamic link prediction in heterogeneous networks", "author": ["Charu C.

Producing consistent evaluations of the performance of the many link prediction algorithms being proposed can be challenging due to variable graph properties, such as size and density. In this paper we first discuss traditional data mining solutions which are applicable to link prediction evaluation, arguing about their capacity for producing faithful and useful evaluations. We also introduce an innovative modification to a traditional evaluation methodology with the goal of adapting it to the problem of evaluating link prediction algorithms when applied to large graphs, by tackling the problem of class imbalance. We empirically evaluate the proposed methodology and, building on these findings, make a case for its importance on the evaluation of large-scale graph processing.
