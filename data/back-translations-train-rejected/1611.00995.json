McDonald and Nivre (2011) identify two types of approaches to dependency parsing: graph-based approaches (McDonald et al., 2005) and transition-based approaches (Nivre et al., 2005; Nivre et al., 2007b; Bohnet et al.; Zhang and Nivre, 2011; Martins et al., 2013; Choi and McCallum, 2013) manually define a set of core and combined features associated with unilateral representations.
