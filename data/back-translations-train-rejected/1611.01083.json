INTRODUCTION", "text": "In human languages around the world, there are a lot of words with different meanings depending on the context. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) [1-5] is the process of identifying the likely meaning of ambiguous words based on different situations. The word \"bank\" has several meanings, such as \"place for supervising transactions,\" \"turning point of a flow,\" and so on. Such words with ambiguous meanings are inherently ambiguous. The process of identification to determine the appropriate meaning of an ambiguous word for a particular context is known as WSD. Humans decide the meaning of a word based on the characteristic points of a discussion or situation with their own merits. Machines have no ability to decide such an ambiguous situation unless some protocols have been planted in the machines."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Many algorithms have been developed in WSD on the basis of supervised and unsupervised learning. \"Reading\" and \"Bag-of-Words\" are two well-known methods discussed in this section as the basis of our proposed approach."}, {"heading": "2.1. Preliminaries of Lesk", "text": "Typical reading approach selects a short phrase from the sentence that contains an ambiguous word. Then, the dictionary definition (luster) of each of the ambiguous word senses is compared with the glosses of other words in that particular sentence. An ambiguous word is associated with the particular sense whose luster has the highest frequency (number of words in common) with the glosses of other words in the phrase. Example 1: \"Aries and Sita go to the bank to withdraw money every day.\" Here, the phrase is taken according to the window size (number of consecutive words). If window size is 3, then the phrase would be \"Go Bank.\" All other words are discarded as \"Stop Words.\" Consider the glosses of all words represented in that particular expression as follows: The number of senses of \"Bank\" is \"2\" like \"X\" and \"Y\" (see Table 1). The number of senses of \"Go\" is \"2\" like \"A\" and \"B\" refer to the number of deductions."}, {"heading": "Word Probable sense", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Keyword Probable sense", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Word Probable sense", "text": "Consider the word \"bank\" as a keyword: the number of common words is measured between two sentences."}, {"heading": "Pair of Sentences Common number of Words", "text": "Table 4 shows all possibilities based on sentences from Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 and the number of words that occur in any possible pairing.

Y counter, YC = A \"+ B\" + M \"+ N.\" Therefore, a higher counter value than the meaning of the keyword \"bank\" in a particular sentence would be assigned."}, {"heading": "2.2. Preliminaries of Bag-of-Words", "text": "The Bag of Words approach is a model used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine the actual meaning of a word with different meanings based on different contexts. In this approach, there is a pocket for each meaning of a keyword (unique word) and all pockets are filled manually. If the meaning of a keyword were unique, the sentence (containing the keyword) is picked up and the entire sentence broken down into individual words. Then, every word in the sentence (except \"stop words\") would be compared with every word of any \"sense pocket\" that searches for the maximum frequency of common words."}, {"heading": "3. BACKGROUND", "text": "In this essay, the basic ideas are taken from the typical reading algorithm and the bag-of-words algorithm, introducing some modifications."}, {"heading": "3.1 Modified Lesk Approach", "text": "In this approach, the glosse of the keyword is considered only within a particular sentence, rather than the selection of all the words. The number of common words is calculated between a particular sentence and each dictionary, based on definitions of a particular keyword. \u2022 Consider the aforementioned sentence of \"Example 1\" as follows: \"Aries and Sita go to the bank to withdraw money every day.\" \u2022 The instance sentence would be \"Aries Sita go to the bank to withdraw money every day\" after discarding the \"stop words\" such as \"to,\" \"for,\" and so on. \u2022 If \"Bank\" is considered a keyword and its two senses are X and Y (see Table 1), then the number of common words between the instance set and any probable sense of \"Bank\" (see Table 1) should be calculated. \u2022 The number of common words found would be assigned to the counter of this sense of \"Bank.\" Consider that the code value would be placed \"below the specific word value of the code value and Y would be placed under the counterword I.\" Finally, \""}, {"heading": "3.2 Bag-of-Words Approach", "text": "A list of different words from the \"read\" approach and the \"bag of words\" approach is prepared based on a successful disambigualization of the keyword. \u2022 The proposed algorithm stores incomparable words in a temporary database. \u2022 The special meaning is assigned to other distinctive words within a temporary database based on the derivation of the sense of the ambiguous word. \u2022 If typical \"read\" and \"bag of words\" algorithms derive the same sense of a particular ambiguous word, then the sense associated with distinctive words is moved into the associated \"meaning bag\" of the \"bag of words\" approach in order to participate directly in the disambiguity. \u2022 Otherwise, the sense associated with distinctive words is moved into a \"foreseeable database.\" \u2022 If the occurrence of a distinctive word has a specific meaning, then the threshold value for the decision-making within the database is exceeded. \""}, {"heading": "4.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT", "text": "Typical literal disambiguation approaches examine efficiency on the basis of three parameters such as \"precision,\" \"recall,\" and \"F-measure.\" [20] Precision (P) is the ratio of \"matched target words based on human choice\" and \"number of instances the system responds to the respective words.\" The callback value (R) is the ratio of \"number of target words for which the response matches the human response\" and \"total number of target words in the data set.\" F-measure is evaluated as \"(2 * P * R / (P + R),\" based on the calculation of precision and recall value. Different data set types are taken into account in our experiments to determine the superiority of our proposed design.Tests were performed on huge data sets under which a sample is taken into account to show the comparative results between typical approaches and our proposed approach.

The bank that creates maximum trust in the hearts of people is considered the most successful bank. Few trusted names in India are SBI, PNB and RBI. RBI is such a big name that people can bet on it. Here is a small story: One day a boy found a one rupee coin near the riverbank. He wanted to keep this money safe, but he could not find anyone he could rely on. He thought to deposit the money under a tree, in the ground, near the riverbank. Moral of the story: children find the earth as the safest bank. Here is another story about a beggar.

The efficiency of an algorithm based on a fixed-size learning set is improved in this contribution to the enrichment of data sets. \"Bag-of-Words\" and \"Modified Read\" approaches each give the \"F-Measure\" value of 0.65 and 0.57, respectively; while the proposed approach gives the \"F-Measure\" value of 0.86, as the learning set is dynamically enriched with new context-sensitive definitions of certain words after each iteration6. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, our approach has established better performance in the improved WSD technique depending on specific learning sets. Accuracy of disambiguity is improved as data sets are populated with new data.
