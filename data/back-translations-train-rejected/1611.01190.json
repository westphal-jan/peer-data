Let C be any typical class of Boolean circuits, and C[s(n)] denote n-variable C-circuits of size \u2264 s(n). We show: Learning Speedups. If C[poly(n)] admits a randomized weak learning algorithm under the uniform distribution with membership queries that runs in time 2/n, then for every k \u2265 1 and \u03b5 > 0 the class C[n] can be learned to high accuracy in timeO(2 \u03b5 ). There is \u03b5 > 0 such that C[2 \u03b5 ] can be learned in time 2/n if and only if C[poly(n)] can be learned in time 2 O(1) . Equivalences between Learning Models. We use learning speedups to obtain equivalences between various randomized learning and compression models, including sub-exponential time learning with membership queries, sub-exponential time learning with membership and equivalence queries, probabilistic function compression and probabilistic average-case function compression. A Dichotomy between Learnability and Pseudorandomness. In the non-uniform setting, there is non-trivial learning for C[poly(n)] if and only if there are no exponentially secure pseudorandom functions computable in C[poly(n)]. Lower Bounds from Nontrivial Learning. If for each k \u2265 1, (depth-d)-C[n] admits a randomized weak learning algorithm with membership queries under the uniform distribution that runs in time 2/n, then for each k \u2265 1, BPE * (depth-d)-C[n]. If for some \u03b5 > 0 there are P-natural proofs useful against C[2 \u03b5 ], then ZPEXP * C[poly(n)]. Karp-Lipton Theorems for Probabilistic Classes.
