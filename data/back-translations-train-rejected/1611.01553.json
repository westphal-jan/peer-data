Current QBF solvers based on counterexample-guided expansion use a recursive approach which scales poorly with the number of quantifier alternations. Our generalization of CEGIS removes the need for this recursive approach, and we instantiate it to yield a simple and efficient algorithm for QBF solving.

Conversely, the database of counter-examples is a set A of assignments to all universally quantified variables. This means that the algorithm is symmetrical between the universal and the existential variables: to find a new set of counter-examples (i.e. candidate solution), we expand the formula with the candidate (i.e. set of counter-examples) and call a SAT solver to find an assignment to the universal (or existential) variables."}, {"heading": "3 A novel algorithm for QBF solving", "text": "We indifferently refer to our algorithm and its prototypical implementation as alejtehad, after the concept of the same name in Islamic philosophy: it refers both to the argumentation process by which jurisprudence is produced, and to the state of knowledge that one knows nothing. This points to the minimalist nature of the algorithm: alejtehad is simple in the sense that it is concise to describe and has few prerequisites, both in theory and in its implementation. It relies on an iterative process in which arguments and counter-arguments are produced until a solution is found. Apart from the novelty and simplicity of its solution algorithm, alejtehad is unusual in that it is efficient, as described, without relying on complex formula optimizations or implementation strategies that are not described in Section 3.3."}, {"heading": "3.1 Notation", "text": "In the entirety of this essay, the examples QBF and Q are defined for the matrix (i.e. the proposition bodies) of a QBF formula.

Here are noteworthy aspects of our implementation that make it powerful: - With each iteration, new statement conjunctions are introduced in land use plans and land use plans: We systematically use incremental SAT solutions. - Existing clauses are not duplicated in land use plans or land use plans. - Likewise, when converting land use plans to land use plans, Tseitin results are naively converted into large (albeit linear) bubbles: Instead, we maintain a cache that assigns a Tseitin variable to each clause; if a clause has already been edited, no new clauses are added to land use plans and the existing Tseitin variable is restored. While RAReQS, with which we compare our implementation in section 5 pure optimizations, does not include the same as the formula used in its implementation prior to Qlicite."}, {"heading": "4 Formal arguments", "text": "As already mentioned, algorithm 1 is very simple, as are its dismissal and soundness arguments.

With each iteration of algorithm 1, A increases strictly (with regard to the specified inclusion). Evidence. The only operation that affects A is the addition of A, so A increases. Therefore, it is sufficient to prove that at least one new counterexample is produced with each iteration. For a specific A, if: = \"Y-AQ\" (XY, Y) is satisfactory, Q (XY, Y) applies in the resulting model to each counterexample Y-A. Therefore, one cannot rely only on existing counter-examples (concrete values that already exist in A): either it is unsatisfactory (and the algorithm ends), or the produced model contains new values that A is added, which thus (strictly) become larger.

To further support the claim that alejtehad outperforms RAReQS on QBFs with many quantifying alternatives, we have run both approaches without external preprocessing7 on hard random QBFs. All the QBFs studied were generated by BlocksQBF [8] and had a fixed structure in which each clause of the quantified CNF vectored a variable variable.
