Neural network is one of the techniques which are widely used for diagnosis in medical field. In this article efficiency of nine algorithms, which are basis of neural network learning in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, will be assessed. Algorithms are assessed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, transparency, AROC and convergence rate by means of 10 fold cross validation. The results suggest that in training phase, Lonberg-M algorithm has the best efficiency in terms of all metrics, algorithm OSS has maximum accuracy in testing phase, algorithm SCG has the maximum transparency and algorithm CGB has the maximum sensitivity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Nov 2016 17:17:14 GMT  (527kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01678v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["mirmorsal madani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01678"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.01678.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Comparing learning algorithms in neural network for diagnosing cardiovascular disease", "authors": ["Mirmorsal Madani"], "emails": ["mt_madani@yahoo.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, the time has come for us to be able to try to find a solution that is in the position we are in."}, {"heading": "GRADIENT REDUCTION ALGORITHMS", "text": "In Figure 2, AROC values exist in test and training phases for cardiovascular data. OSS reached 0.8378 in the test algorithm and LM 0.9472 in the training algorithm, representing the maximum AROC level. Figure 3 shows the speed of training algorithms for neural networks. Objective function was the mean square error and attempts were made to reduce MSE in the repetition of neural training algorithms in order to achieve the required value. Figure 3 shows that the error of the LM algorithm was reduced at the highest speed than other algorithms. CONCLUSION In this paper, 9 algorithms for detecting heart disease were tested. Neural network with architectural recording 1 _ 7 _ 13 was applied (13 neurons in the input layer, 7 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 neuron in the baseline layer). In neural network training, the Lonberg algorithm was tested with maximum accuracy, 7M and sensitivity in the OGb algorithms."}], "references": [{"title": "Melanoma.
