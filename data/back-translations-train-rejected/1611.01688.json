The crux of our design is to add perturbations in a way that leads to oracle efficiency. We reduce this to designing a translation matrix that translates a low-dimensional vector with independent noise components into a high-dimensional vector of perturbations in the learner's action space. Our approach generalizes previous work on oracle-efficient online learning [11, 22, 27, 35] ranging from online combination optimization, learning in simultaneous auctions, and contextual learning. Our auction design framework considers an auctioneer who learns an optimal auction rule in an online manner that observes an adequately selected vector of valuations every day."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves how they have behaved."}, {"heading": "2 Overview of Main Results and Techniques", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Oracle-Efficient Learning and the Generalized FTPL", "text": "The question about the \"why?,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \"why,\" \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \",\" \",\", \"\", \"\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \"\", \",\" \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \"\", \",\", \"\", \",\" \",\", \",\" \",\" \",\", \",\", \"\" \",\", \",\" \",\", \"\" \",\", \",\" \",\", \"\", \"\", \",\" \",\", \",\" \"\", \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\" \",\", \",\" \",\", \",\", \"\", \",\", \"\", \"\", \",\", \"\", \",\", \",\" \",\", \",\" \",\" \",\" \",\", \",\", \",\" \",\" \",\" \"\", \",\", \",\", \"\" \",\", \",\" \",\", \",\" \",\", \",\" \",\", \",\" \",\" \"\", \"\", \",\", \"\", \"\", \",\" \",\", \",\" \",\" \",\", \"\", \"\", \",\", \"\", \"\", \",\" \"\" \",\", \",\", \",\", \",\""}, {"heading": "2.2 Main Application: Online Optimal Auction Design", "text": "In this year, it has come to the point where one sees oneself in a position to live in a country in which most people are able to move into another world, in which they are able to live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they are"}, {"heading": "3 Generalized FTPL and Oracle-Efficient Online Learning", "text": "We then describe the conditions under which this algorithm efficiently reduces online learning to offline optimization.

They provided a computationally efficient algorithm whose total revenue is at least 1 / 2 of the best revenue among the auctions in me, plus a term that is o (T).

We start with the simpler setting, in which the learner's actions are drawn, and then analyze the slightly more complex setting, in which the learner's actions follow a fast-shuffling Markov chain. For both settings, we show that the average payout of the learning algorithm is as large as the optimal expected payout, in anticipation of the i.i.d. distribution in the i.d. setting and the stationary distribution in the Markovian settings.

efficient no-regret algorithms, when given access to an oracle for the offline optimization version of the problem. We present an algorithm that we call Generalized Follow-thePerturbed-Leader (Generalized FTPL) and provide conditions under which it achieves vanishing regret and is efficiently implementable with an oracle. Our second main contribution is the introduction of a new online adversarial auction-design framework for revenue maximization and an application of our oracle-efficient learning results to the adaptive optimization of auctions. Our learning algorithm is a generalization of the classic FTPL algorithm of Kalai and Vempala [27], playing at every iteration the historically best-performing action after adding some perturbation to the performance of each of its actions. The crux of our design is adding perturbations in a manner that leads to oracle-efficiency. We reduce this to designing a translation matrix, which translates a low dimensional vector with independent noise components into a high dimensional vector of perturbations on the learner\u2019s action space. Our approach generalizes prior work on oracle-efficient online learning [11, 22, 27, 35], ranging from online combinatorial optimization, learning in simultaneous auctions, and contextual learning. Our auction-design framework considers an auctioneer learning an optimal auction rule in an online manner, every day observing an adversarially chosen vector of valuations. The auctioneer\u2019s goal is to achieve revenue that competes with the revenue of the optimal auction in hindsight among those in some target class. We give oracle-efficient learning results for: (1) VCG auctions with bidder-specific reserves in single-parameter settings with matroid constraints, (2) envy-free item pricing in multi-item auctions with unlimited supply, and (3) s-level auctions of Morgenstern and Roughgarden [28] for singleitem settings. The last result implies good regret against the optimal overall auction when valuations are coming from a fast mixing Markov chain, that is independent across bidders. We also extend our results to the case when the learner observes side information on the bidders before running the auction (contextual learning). We present additional extensions to contextual learning and learning with approximate oracles, implemented by FPTAS or Maximal-in-Range algorithms. We provide further applications in online welfare maximization in multi-unit auctions and in no-regret learning in simultaneous item auctions, answering an open question from prior work. \u2217Microsoft Research, New York, mdudik@microsoft.com \u2020Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, nhaghtal@cs.cmu.edu \u2021Microsoft Research, New York, haipeng@microsoft.com \u00a7Microsoft Research, New York, schapire@microsoft.com \u00b6Microsoft Research, New England, vasy@microsoft.com \u2016Microsoft Research, New York, jenn@microsoft.com ar X iv :1 61 1. 01 68 8v 1 [ cs .L G ] 5 N ov 2 01 6", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
