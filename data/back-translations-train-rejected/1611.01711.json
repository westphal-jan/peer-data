Although an abductive explanation could be seen as the cause of observation, it has been argued that causes and abductive explanations are not necessarily identical [50, 21]. In the context of the abductive approach to diagnosis [17, 22, 48, 49] it is common for the system specification to describe more causal information, especially in action theories where the effects of actions are directly represented by positively defined rules. By limiting explanatory formulas to predicates describing primitive causes (actions), there is an explanatory formula that entails observation, also a cause for observation.

Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have investigated the calculation aspects of causality for responses to Datalog queries, which has been made possible by establishing precise relationships (mutual reductions) with adjunctions from Datalog theories. This link is interesting in itself. In particular, the notion of necessity-degree for abductive explanations, motivated by causality concepts, has been identified as relevant (see Section 4.3). We have also explored in detail the relationships between query-response causality for monotonous queries and updates through views defined by monotonsequences. Of particular relevance is our investigation of viewrelated causality, for which we established links with the viewside effect-free deletion problem. We have achieved new complexity results for both problems. The problem of causality under Integrity Restrictions (ICs) has not been investigated so far."}, {"heading": "8.1. Causality and ICs", "text": "Some ICs are implicit, such as INDs and tgds, which makes it tempting to give them causal semantics. For example, in [54] and more in the context of explanatory interventions, a causal dependence on Pj (t-j) on Pi (t-j) and Pi (t-j) is considered. On this basis, a valid intervention removes Pj (t-j) when Pi (t-j) is removed from the instance. This is consistent with our general approach, as can be seen in Example 21, with the Q1 query and the t1.Giving ICs a causal connotation is debatable. In fact, according to [31] logical dependencies are not causal dependencies per se. Our approach is also consistent with this view, since ICs precursors of implications are not actual causes, but only elements of contingency, as can be seen, causal dependencies are not causal dependencies per se."}, {"heading": "8.2. Endogenous tuples and view updates", "text": "The division of a database into endogenous and exogenous tuples used in causality may also be of interest in the context of delete propagation.

Indeed, in an instance D = Dn-Dx, a view V defined by a monotonous Q query, and an endogenous delete propagation, solutions for an encyclopedia (in all its flavors) can be obtained from actual causes for a partitioned instance. Example 25. (Example 10) Let us again assume that < John, XML > must be deleted from the View Extension.

Related connections", "text": "Our work, in combination with the results reported in [7], shows that there are deeper and multiple connections between the areas of QA causality, abductive and consistency-based diagnosis, view updates, and database repairs. Links between consistency-based and abductive diagnosis have been established, for example, in [16]. Abduction has been explicitly applied to database repairs [3]. The idea, in turn, is to \"derive\" possible repair updates that bring the database into a consistent state. Further research and exploitation of these connections is the subject of ongoing and future research. The view update problem has been addressed from the point of view of inductive reasoning [35, 18]. The basic idea is to establish the presence of tuples in the basic tables that explain the presence of these tuples in viewer reproduction, the one that would like to be reproduced (see section 7.1)."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.
