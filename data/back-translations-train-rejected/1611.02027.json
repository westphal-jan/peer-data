Emoji represents a range of faces, animals, weather, emotions and activities to compensate for a lack of verbal and non-verbal stimuli in face-to-face communication (Davis and Edberg, 2016; Dresner and Herring, 2010). Widespread support for emoji input on desktops and mobile devices has led to the rapid introduction of emoji as a communication tool and part of popular culture, resulting in a word of the year 2015 (Oxford Dictionaries, 2015) and, somewhat questionably, a feature film translated for release in 2017 (IMDb, 2016). Davis and Edberg (2016) also suggest that the limited reach and lack of formal grammar in emoji lead to ambiguous messages and highlight the playful aspect of composing and decoding emoji."}, {"heading": "2 Corpus Analysis", "text": "The data set contains 9,971 pairs of text and emoji translations. We present the text using the standard NLTK token (Bird et al., 2009). Numbers and stopwords are removed and all tokens are lowercase. The descriptive statistics of the two corpora, TEXT and EMOJI, show some differences. In addition, emoji sentences are about half as long as text sets with corresponding means of 9.4 to 20.8. Figure 2 records the number of logs of two corpora tokens or emoji frequencies against their order (16,454 types) and 93,342 emoji tokens (470 types). Furthermore, emoji sentences are about half as long as text sets with corresponding means of 9.4 to 20.8."}, {"heading": "3 Aligning emoji to tokens", "text": "To explore this, we are learning an IBM translation model one (Brown et al., 1993) using the NLTK implementation with standard parameters. We are preparing the parallel text by removing English stopwords and punctuation, and filtering out pairs that have no input or output, leaving 9,734 pairs. We are opting for the simplest model with the fewest assumptions about the \"language pair,\" but with the caveat that it does not consider well-aligned token phrases for a single emoji, as a phrase-based translation model might allow. We have examined some of the more advanced IBM models and sequence-to-sequence neural models (Sutskever et al., 2014), but these did not seem to yield easy-to-interpret results (remember that despite Turner's predictions, translations are the best translations for those that seem to match extremely loud due to the high subjectivity of human emotions and the lack of ability to align the individual emotions. \""}, {"heading": "4 Emoji parts-of-speech", "text": "We apply the BookNLP pipeline (Bamman et al., 2014) to the original text, which predicts linguistic markups, character clusters, and many other linguistic metadata. Again, we expect this to be loud, since the models are not adapted to 19th century literature. Nevertheless, we are able to generate a distribution of noisy POS day1 for each token, and then create a distribution of POS for each emoji by applying the chain rule and alignment probabilities above. Most emojis are NN, with the highest probability. Only 5 emojis have a different POS prefix - VB - including (i.e. \"see\" or \"see\" from Table 2). Although the low probabilities and the summarized noise of the model hardly make the results seem convincing, it is interesting that some emojis seem to align more strongly with verbs, suggesting their consistent use as actions."}, {"heading": "5 Modelling repeats in emoji", "text": "Since emojis are often used to convey additional layers of emotion or context, we examine how emojis are repeated. Counting the usual emoji bigrams, the most common emojis are followed by repeat bigrams and. Emojis are much more likely to be repeated bigrams (3.2%) than texts (0.4%), suggesting that there are asystemic differences in usage, although it is not clear whether they are used as amplifiers (\"very strong\") or as counting mechanisms (\"many boys\")."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "Fascinating as the data set is, there are significant challenges to work with it and draw strong conclusions from it. First, the setting is idiosyncratic and different from the common use of emojis because it lacks the textual context in which emojis are usually found. Results in these contexts might not necessarily apply to emojis found in informal discourse on the Web. Indeed, one promising direction seems to be to embed models that allow for an elegant fusion of text and emoji content (Barbieri et al., 2016; Eisner et al., 2016). The constraints on limited vocabulary foster creativity that, in combination with the translator's desire to produce a witty translation, only serves to increase the subjectivity of the data set, exacerbated by the small size of the data set, and while there are neat limitations in emojis (shells, 2012 sequences, not clear), whether it will hold longer sequences."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We use NLP techniques to compare the statistical properties of the two corpora (EMOJI and TEXT) and show that emojis operate in a much smaller space. Machine translation statistical alignment models allow us to examine how translators map emojis to tokens, including plural and synonymous forms. We also looked at a noise-induced POS distribution that shows that most emojis are nouns, some of which most commonly operate as verbs, and that emoji POS distribution places emphasis on nouns and verbs, a phenomenon that bears some resemblance to pidgins. Finally, we briefly examine how emojis are repeated, finding a much higher repetition rate in emojis than text. Emoji provide a rare opportunity to study a rapidly evolving and increasingly important form of communication that complements text and language, and has parallels to human languages such as pidgins."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Thanks to Fred Benenson and Chris Mulligan for the joke of creating the project and sharing the data.
