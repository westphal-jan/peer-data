Materials and methods: An iterative annotation method was proposed to train annotators and to develop annotation guidelines. Then, by using annotation quality assurance measures, a comprehensive corpus was built, containing annotations of part-of-speech (POS) tags, syntactic tags, entities, assertions, and relations. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was calculated to evaluate the annotation quality and a Chinese clinical text processing and information extraction system (CCTPIES) was developed based on our annotated corpus. Results: The syntactic corpus consists of 138 Chinese clinical documents with 47,424 tokens and 2553 full parsing trees, while the semantic corpus includes 992 documents that annotated 39,511 entities with their assertions and 7695 relations. IAA evaluation shows that this comprehensive corpus is of good quality, and the system modules are effective. Discussion: The annotated corpus makes a considerable contribution to natural language processing (NLP) research into Chinese texts in the clinical domain. However, this corpus has a number of limitations. Some additional types of clinical text should be introduced to improve corpus coverage and active learning methods should be utilized to promote annotation efficiency. Conclusions: In this study, several annotation guidelines and an annotation method for Chinese clinical texts were proposed, and a comprehensive corpus with its NLP modules were constructed, providing a foundation for further study of applying NLP techniques to Chinese texts in the clinical domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 15:05:06 GMT  (1586kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02091v1", "27 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 08:48:59 GMT  (2595kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02091v2", "27 pages, submitted to Journal of Biomedical Informatics"]], "COMMENTS": "27 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["bin he", "bin dong", "yi guan", "jinfeng yang", "zhipeng jiang", "qiubin yu", "jianyi cheng", "chunyan qu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02091"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.02091.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Building a comprehensive syntactic and semantic corpus of Chinese clinical texts", "authors": ["Bin He", "Bin Dong", "Yi Guan", "Jinfeng Yang", "Zhipeng Jiang", "Qiubin Yu", "Jianyi Cheng", "Chunyan Qu"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Aim: To build a comprehensive corpus covering syntactical and semantic annotations of Chinese clinical texts with appropriate annotation guidelines and methods, and to develop tools trained on the annotated corpus to provide the basis for clinical research into Chinese texts.

Introduction", "text": "The situation is becoming increasingly urgent for China, a country with the largest population but limited medical resources. Faced with these challenges, the Chinese Ministry of Health has issued a series of relevant regulatory regulations since 2010 to standardize EMR systems and their intelligent support. With the rapid popularization of EMRs, the development of healthcare services has a solid data base. Clinical texts, an important type of patient data within EMRs, are free-text documents that contain large amounts of information about patients and their intelligent support."}, {"heading": "2. Background", "text": "NLP tasks can be divided into low-level and higher-level tasks: low-level tasks include sentence boundary recognition, tokenization, word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, shallow parsing, etc.; based on higher-level tasks, tasks include tasks called entity recognition (NLP), denial identification, relationship extraction, etc. [10] Commentary corpora in the clinical field are required as a bridge to adapt existing techniques to the clinical field.

Current status in English clinical texts", "text": "The Mayo Clinic's cTAKES system aims at comprehensive processing of clinical texts and covers various NLP techniques [6]. In this work, a linguistic corpus for POS marking and shallow parsing was created by three linguistic experts, extending the Penn TreeBank (PTB) annotation guidelines [25, 26] to the clinical area. Furthermore, Albright et al. [11] constructed a corpus with annotations of POS tags and syntactic trees, and its advantage is that multi-layered annotations are performed in each sentence, which is beneficial for the training of common models. As Albright et al. [12] showed, the sentences in clinical texts contain numerous patterns that do not appear in the parenthesis guidelines for the PTB [26], and clinical texts have sublinguistic properties [27, 28]. For this reason, Fan et al. [10] developed annotation guidelines for the Parrital Clinic Advancement Texts of Pittsburgh and a syntactical Corrital)."}, {"heading": "2.1.2. Current status in Chinese clinical texts", "text": "Word segmentation is a first processing step for low-level tasks in Chinese texts. Xu et al. [13] found that vocabulary words and the elimination of ambiguities in clinical texts posed a major challenge to word segmentation, and that a state-of-the-art Chinese word segmentator trained by a general corpus would perform poorly in clinical terms. Therefore, they commented a corpus of segmented words manually in discharge summaries to improve the performance of word segmenters in Chinese clinical texts. Similarly, Zhang et al. [14] constructed similar corpus to achieve better word embedding characteristics."}, {"heading": "2.2. Annotated clinical text corpus for higher-level tasks", "text": "In fact, this corpus was somewhat limited, as only medical problems and two types of claims were commented on. To automatically extract more information from clinical texts, Roberts et al. [16] randomly selected 50 clinical symptoms, 50 histopathological reports, and 50 imaging reports to annotated units, relationships, modifiers, co-references, and temporal information under the CLinical E-Science Framework (CLEF). This was the first corpus to expand the number of entity types to six, and was the first attempt to establish relationships with annotorial entities."}, {"heading": "2.2.2. Current status in Chinese clinical texts", "text": "Xu et al. [13] designated medical problems, treatments and tests in Chinese discharge guidelines and added two other entity types, namely drugs and anatomy. Drugs are separated from treatment to further analyze the use and efficacy of medications, and anatomy can help locate positions of symptoms or tests. Similar to Xu et al. \"s corpus of entities, Lei et al. [19] developed an entity corpus of discharge summaries and admissions protocols of Beijing Union Medical College Hospital. Their entity categories differ from the 2010 i2b2 / VA concept guidelines in that treatments are divided into procedures and medications. In addition, Xu et al.

Shortcomings of research on Chinese clinical texts", "text": "Considering the level of research described above, research on clinical texts in China has three shortcomings: first, low-level research is quite limited, and this may result in a bottleneck in the performance of higher-level tasks; second, as far as we know, only negated claims and symptom-herbal correlations are to be commented on; other types of claims or relationships have not been systematically commented on; and third, policy tuning and annotator training in body creation are required, but descriptions of previous research efforts have not described these processing methods. Based on the above three points, and the fact that no clinical corpus written in Chinese has been made available to the public, it is imperative to create a comprehensive corpus that follows a complete annotation scheme."}, {"heading": "3.

Annotation guidelines", "text": "Due to the diversity of clinical texts, there is no widely applicable annotation scheme in the clinical field [11]. Due to differences in language characteristics between Chinese and English, annotation guidelines for CTB [35-37] were selected to develop guidelines for subordinate tasks in Chinese clinical texts; in the meantime, annotation guidelines were used in the 2010 i2b2 / VA challenge [31-33] to develop guidelines for subordinate tasks. In accordance with the characteristics of Chinese clinical texts, we developed several modified annotation guidelines [38-41] for four subordinate and three superordinate tasks.

Word segmentation", "text": "The segmentation guidelines for Penn Chinese TreeBank (CTB) [35] cannot cover all segmentation ambiguities in clinical texts, in particular the segmentation of medical terms, abbreviations and their combinations. To address these segmentation ambiguities, the word segmentation guidelines used three word properties: 1. Combinability [42], which means that a word can be divided into two sub-words and that each sub-word has its own POS; 2. Reduceability, which means that a word, if it is an abbreviation, can be converted back to its fully extended form to clarify its description; 3. Interchangeability, which means that a sub-word in a combination word can be replaced by another word with the same POS and that the new combination word can still occur in clinical texts. Obviously, medical terms, if they do not represent combinations, are such that these combinations are not typically found in the same method."}, {"heading": "3.2.1.2.

[34] pointed out, patients \"medical problems can be presented as diseases and symptoms, and these two types of concepts have separate semantic UMLS types; therefore, in our Annotation Guidelines we treated diseases and symptoms as two types of medical unit as presented in Table 2A. In the 2010 i2b2 / VA Challenge, only claims of medical problems were commented on, and each medical problem was assigned to one of the six types of claim [32]. In our work, we did not find a hypothetical unit in Chinese clinical texts, but observed a relatively frequent claim in the present standard category, so that we deleted the hypothetical claim type and the additional type of claim from the present time (we presented six claims of symptomatic and Chinese clinical disease types)."}, {"heading": "3.2.2.2.

We used a sequence marking method to train statistical models for word segmentation, POS tagging, shallow parsing and named entity recognition. CRF + + [50], an open source implementation of the conditional field algorithm, was used to train these models. As shown in Table 5, the evaluation results of these modules trained by CRF + + are quite excellent, as they all match the level of practical application achieved."}, {"heading": "5.

Contributions of this work", "text": "In this study, we constructed a comprehensive syntactic and semantic corpus of Chinese clinical texts that includes annotations on word segmentation, POS marking, shallow parsing, complete parsing, NOT, classification of assertions and extraction. As there is extensive medical knowledge in clinical texts, we referred to general and clinical annotation guidelines and developed annotation guidelines for Chinese clinical texts with the help of physicians. As described in the annotation development section, many improvements were proposed to adapt to the characteristics of Chinese clinical texts. Prior to the creation of the corpus, annotation guidelines maintained the formation of annotation guidelines until their annotation consistency remained at a relatively high level. During the annotation period, existing open source tools for pre-labeling were used and the burden on annotators was significantly reduced. As is well known, double annotation improves the quality of the corpus, as the correction of the corpus can be balanced with the cost of the correction of the corpus in terms."}, {"heading": "5.2. Limitations and future work", "text": "Although our annotated corpus contributes to the study of Chinese texts in the clinical field, there are some limitations in our study. Due to limited annotation resources, the syntactic corpus covers only two departments within the Second Associated Hospital of Harbin Medical University. There are differences in the medical terminology of different hospital departments that may weaken the adaptability of some NLP techniques in different departments.Some research will be conducted in the future. First, transfer learning approaches will be introduced to solve the adjustment problem between different hospital departments. Second, some additional types of clinical texts should be commented on to improve the practicability of the NLP techniques developed based on this corpus. Third, active learning methods will be explored to reduce the annotation burden for annotators by filtering redundant samples from unlabeled data and selecting undertrained samples for the annotators. Finally, algorithms to improve the performance of NLP texts for clinical systems will be developed."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we described the structure of a corpus of Chinese clinical texts using an iterative annotation methodology, and by following the annotation guidelines developed in this study, a high degree of annotation consistency was achieved. In addition, a CCTPIES was developed to verify the usefulness of the corpus, which performed excellently. To the best of our knowledge, this corpus is the first comprehensive corpus of Chinese clinical texts to provide a solid basis for future research; the corresponding annotation resources can be found at http: / / github.com / WILAB-HIT / Resources.Author contritionsThis work was a collaboration of all authors.

annotations of Chinese clinical texts with corresponding annotation guidelines and methods as well as to develop tools trained on the annotated corpus, which supplies baselines for research on Chinese texts in the clinical domain. Materials and methods: An iterative annotation method was proposed to train annotators and to develop annotation guidelines. Then, by using annotation quality assurance measures, a comprehensive corpus was built, containing annotations of part-of-speech (POS) tags, syntactic tags, entities, assertions, and relations. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was calculated to evaluate the annotation quality and a Chinese clinical text processing and information extraction system (CCTPIES) was developed based on our annotated corpus. Results: The syntactic corpus consists of 138 Chinese clinical documents with 47,424 tokens and 2553 full parsing trees, while the semantic corpus includes 992 documents that annotated 39,511 entities with their assertions and 7695 relations. IAA evaluation shows that this comprehensive corpus is of good quality, and the system modules are effective. Discussion: The annotated corpus makes a considerable contribution to natural language processing (NLP) research into Chinese texts in the clinical domain. However, this corpus has a number of limitations. Some additional types of clinical text should be introduced to improve corpus coverage and active learning methods should be utilized to promote annotation efficiency. Conclusions: In this study, several annotation guidelines and an annotation method for Chinese clinical texts were proposed, and a comprehensive corpus with its NLP modules were constructed, providing a foundation for further study of applying NLP techniques to Chinese texts in the clinical domain.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
