It will also allow a clear comparison between semantics of the same family and semantics of expansion and ranking."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "An argument gives rise to support a claim that is questionable, or open to doubt. It consists of three components: premises that represent the reason, a conclusion that is the claim supported, and a link that shows how the premises lead to the conclusion. Thus, the link is the logical \"adhesives\" that link premises and conclusions together. An argument has an intrinsic strength that can come from various sources: the certainty of reason [Amgoud and Cayrol, 2002], the meaning of the value it promotes, if any [Bench-Capon, 2003], the reliability of its source [Parsons et al., 2011]. Whatever its intrinsic strength is (strong or weak), an argument can be attacked by other arguments. An attack amounts to undermining one of the components of an argument, and thus has a negative impact on its goal. An assessment of the general strength (or general acceptance) of an argument becomes compelling."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction and Background", "text": "The problem of judgment aggregation (YES), i.e. the problem of aggregating the opinions of a group of agents q, through a series of logically related proposals, has recently received much attention from researchers in multi-agent systems, philosophy and economics. In this lecture, we report on current and ongoing work on a version of this problem in defining abstract argumentations.We proceed from a fixed sentence Ag \"t1,.., nu from agents, the arguments of a given reasoning framework (AF) A. Each assessment takes the form of an A-labeling, i.e. an assignment of one of the labels in (the term accepted), from (rejected) or undec (undecided) to each argument of A.

The feasible labeling is those that correspond to the respective reasoning semantics."}, {"heading": "2 Postulates for Aggregation Methods", "text": "A basic requirement is that we want the results to be practicable.1: Collective completeness FApLq is a complete A marking.

To correct this, we use the downward permissible and upward open procedures to repair and complete FY pLq. The downward permissible marking \u00e7 L of an arbitrary marking L is obtained by re-labelling each illegally undec-labelled argument with undec. The resulting marking is permissible but not necessarily complete. The upward complete marking \u00e4L of a given permissible marking is obtained by re-labelling each illegally undec-labelled argument with in or out accordingly. (See [Caminada and Pigozzi, 2011] for details. The DAUC version of an interval method FY is obtained by taking for each given AF A and Aprofile L the argument \u00eaFYA pLq as the baseline value. Collective completeness is guaranteed by construction. DAUC interval methods do not satisfy the independence FY, but they satisfy the F\u00eaq argument in F\u00eaoth-L instead."}, {"heading": "3.3 Partial Resolution-based Methods", "text": "Another way to use a family of intervals Y to define an aggregation method is the partial resolution approach [Baroni et al., 2011]. Suppose a P ArgsA is supported in L ifp | V La: out |, | V La: in | q P Y. Then, let's change A by resolving any mutual attack in favor of Y -based arguments, i.e., if a\u00e9 b, we remove one of these attacks when it goes from an un-Y -based argument to a Y -based argument. Then, GYApLq is defined by taking the grounded designation of this modified VF. The resulting method GY fulfills the collective completeness. Furthermore, FY and GY provide the same results when confined to the class of symmetric AFs (i.e. AFs, for which each attack is reciprocal)."}, {"heading": "3.4 Distance-based Approaches", "text": "Another approach to aggregation is to base it on an idea of the distance dpL1, L2q between labels. So, for example, at such a distance, we could consider the result of the aggregation as the complete label closest to the group. Of course, it may turn out that we have several narrow labels at the end, which means that the output will be a series of labels and not a single one. We also need to define an appropriate distance measure. One way of doing this is the thematic distance [Stand et al., 2012]. Roughly speaking, the arguments in an AF can be divided into a series of questions, i.e. arguments whose labels are either always equal or always opposite (in vs out) in each complete label. The distance dpL1, L2q is then determined by removing a representative from each output and summarizing diff pL1paq, L2paqq over all of these representatives, with a deviation for the difference between the labels (e.g. dediff, 2)."}, {"heading": "4 Further and Ongoing Work", "text": "We are in the process of extending the results not only to AFs, but also to abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs).

Finally, we would like to fully characterize the families of the aggregation methods described here."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to determine for themselves what they want to do and what they want to do are not willing to abide by the rules.

Planning involves drawing up plans whose success is justified by some evidence from one or more of the SCs trading partners, and decision support to assess the acceptability of these plans by comparing the evidence supporting them with possible objections. A planner needs to think about his actions. Therefore, during joint planning, decision-makers need decision support models for selecting, organizing and reviewing their actions and plans. [7] There is a wealth of planning and decision support work in supply chains that can be divided into the following three categories:"}, {"heading": "2.1 Mathematical and analytical based approaches", "text": "Several supply chain collaboration practices suggested in the literature, such as the Vendor Managed Inventory, Just In Time, Efficient Consumer Response, Continuous Replenishment and Accurate Response, Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR), focus on better planning through tight processes, integration and the exchange of forecasting information between SC's trading partners. [8] However, these applications either provide little or no decision-making support with regard to the negotiation process. Several researchers introduced a process model that deals with the aspect of decision-making and negotiations between trading partners, while maintaining their local decision-making power [9; 10]. The research approaches discussed above stem from applied mathematics, such as optimization, statistics and decision theory, and act as a black box for decision makers. They absorb information and generate results, but provide no visibility as to the underlying reasoning and justification behind the results. [11] There are limited examples of such adoption in the literature."}, {"heading": "2.2 Logic-based approaches for automated planning and decision making", "text": "Multi-agent planning systems are advanced planning systems that are applied to independent or loosely coupled problems to enhance the benefits of distributed planning among autonomous software agents. [12] In coordination, software agents working together will build a model of the minds of other agents and update their own beliefs and goals as the dialogue progresses. [13] In order to overcome uncertainties, argument-based frameworks have been proposed that allow various software agents to share knowledge and resolve conflicts between them in order to achieve the common goal. [12] In most GSP systems, however, planning provides the solution, and in its execution it merely traverses the identified path. Such systems work well in closed-world adoption, where all possible effects of any action are known in advance."}, {"heading": "2.3 Logic based approaches supporting planning and decision making", "text": "The introduction of semantic web technology tools for collaboration has addressed some of the problems of cooperation between SC trading partners, such as the importance of information that makes them comprehensible across organizational boundaries and facilitates the exchange and integration of data. [14] Attempts have been made to present incomplete and conflicting information in information systems such as Dr-Prolog, Dr-Device and situated courtly logic. [15] These implementations represent and address only individual conflicting preferences by defining priorities based on a single criterion between them before engaging in collaboration. Therefore, these attempts do not provide a solution for collaborative planning that is subject to inconsistencies derived from multiple data / information sources and multiple users. Moreover, these techniques have not yet been applied to collaborative planning and decision support domains. [16] The collaborative planning and action model is the first attempt to support planners in managing and planning information and facilitate the planning process with automated reasoning."}, {"heading": "3 Motivation", "text": "Despite the increasing use of advanced planning tools and technologies, current SC trading partners are far from structured collaborative planning and decision support for practical considerations. Of the various factors, data integration was considered to be one of the core issues in business information systems [17]. Over the last decade, SC trading partners \"focus has been on record systems (SoR), i.e. structured data on sales, customer and product information, inventory forecasts, and so on, and it has been used for planning and decision making. As a result, centralized business information systems such as data warehousing systems handled exclusively with record-based data can be carefully mapped by schema-centric mediation approaches from knowledge experts to support planning decisions. In such information systems, business intelligence derived for planning can often provide decision support by answering the questions that relate to patterns,\" what happens. \"To answer questions that relate to patterns, what happens, and why it is necessary to decode."}, {"heading": "4 Proposed conceptual framework", "text": "This section proposes to coordinate the activities of trading partners in a supply chain.

DeLP uses the reasoning formalism to argue about contradictory information by identifying contradictory information in the knowledge base and applying the dialectical process to decide which information prevails during the argumentative reasoning process.

It has an intrinsic strength and may be attacked by other arguments. Hence, the evaluation of its overall strength is mandatory. Such an evaluation is done by acceptability semantics. In this talk, we provide the foundations of a semantics, i.e., key concepts and principles on which an evaluation is based. Each concept (principle) is described by an axiom. We then present two families of semantics: extension semantics and ranking semantics. We analyze them against the axioms shedding thus light on the assumptions and choices they made. The analysis allows also a clear comparison between semantics of the same family, and between extension semantics and ranking ones.", "creator": "LaTeX + confproc v0.7"}}}
