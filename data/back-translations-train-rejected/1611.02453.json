For ALCFI-TBoxes of depth one (which cover the vast majority of practically relevant cases), our results are very positive: there is a dichotomy between PTIME and CONP, and it can be accurately characterized in terms of decoding tolerance and materializability. Moreover, and unlike PTIME complexity, which coincides with the rewitchiness in Datalog6, the case of higher or unrestricted depth is more difficult to analyze. We have shown that for ALC and ALCI-TBoxes of depth three, the existence of a dichotomy between PTIME and CONP equals the existence of a dichotomy between PTIME and CONP."}], "references": [{"title": "The complexity of satisfiability problems: Refining Schaefer\u2019s theorem", "author": ["Eric Allender", "Michael Bauland", "Neil Immerman", "Henning Schnoor", "Heribert Vollmer"], "venue": "In MFCS,", "citeRegEx": "Allender et al\\.,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Allender et al\\.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "The DL-Lite family and relations", "author": ["Alessandro Artale", "Diego Calvanese", "Roman Kontchakov", "Michael Zakharyaschev"], "venue": "J.
