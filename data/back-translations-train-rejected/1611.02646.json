It complicates both the process of model construction and the analysis of results. Recently, several approaches have been introduced to address these problems, which relate to a closed number of attributes calculated through the inclusion of formal concepts. Both the terminology of concept construction and the analysis of results have been used. In relation to FCA, a concept consisting of a pair consisting of a closed set of transactions and an intention (the respective closed item set) is a concept. We propose to divide existing approaches to simplify concepts into the groups represented in Figure 1.

Each group consisted of 100 formal contexts with the number of attributes ranging from 10 to 50, and the number of objects varied from 40 to 80. Variance in stability within the group of paired correlation is quite small (no more than 0.05) and does not depend on context density (p-values of the Levene test are less than 0.05).

In this context, we consider the problem of approximation of stability with respect to different levels of the Integrated Stability Index.

To find the best rate, we used randomly generated formal contexts (described in the revision subsection) of different densities: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and used simple linear regression. The jten Integrated Stability Index was taken as a regressor and the stability index as a dependent variable.

A list of formulas is given in Table 2 to make the paper self-contained. More detailed information about the listed indices can be found in [43, 44, 45]. Also, note that association rules indices can be easily adapted to concept evaluations by selecting other concepts and applying the index to pairs \"a selected concept, an evaluated concept.\" In this case, we propose instructions on applying arbitrary indices to closed items, starting with the personal perspective on concept interest. We define the following: 1. Some \"internal\" / \"external\" properties of the concept itself. In this case, homogeneous elements are considered equivalent. 2. Effects of the element on element capture. Here, a metric is applied to a set and its elements: f (element)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we consider various approaches to degrading interesting formal concepts (closed item sets and corresponding transactions), we examined existing indices for concept selection, and proposed a general scheme for adapting an arbitrary index to concept evaluation. The results of our experiments allow us to distinguish groups of correlated indices and identify those of them that can be used to analyze noise data. It has been shown that the noise that filters the quality of indices largely depends on the structure of the concept grid rather than on the noise rate. The strongest dependence of filter quality on noise rate corresponds to stability estimates. Even a small amount of noise added to the data can significantly alter the grid structure that results in distorted values values values values values values of neighboring indices. We also proposed a general method for selecting and designing interesting attributes max indices that fit index-based characteristics well (the use of this notebook-based index in a particular description)."}], "references": [{"title": "Discovering frequent closed itemsets for association rules", "author": ["N.
