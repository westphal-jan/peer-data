Introduction", "text": "Recently, automated grading systems have gained attention for their convenience over traditional grading systems; the fast-growing trust in education technology [1] and the increasing number of students has highlighted the need for an efficient scoring mechanism to completely replace the teacher's role in the scoring process, while saving time and guaranteeing fairness; the Automated Scoring (AS) process deals with evaluating a student's response by comparing it to a model; several types of tools and web services have been developed with the aim of performing automatic scoring of online exams with little or no user intervention."}, {"heading": "2. Related Works", "text": "One of the most commonly used AES models is presented in [3] other AES models: [2] and [1] However, due to its complexity, it is extremely difficult to implement the aforementioned mechanisms for the Arabic language, as they are highly inflexible and ambiguous in the absence of diacritics. There have been few attempts in research on the subject, and so far none of them have been able to provide a fully functioning automatic assessment system. In [4], the authors proposed an Arabic web-based assessment system where students can log in with a username and password to take online exams, exam questions are stored on the server along with correct answers, and the answers are automatically graded by comparing the correct answer to the student's answer. However, the proposed system did not provide an automatic assessment for essay questions, answers to such questions are sent to the instructor for manual evaluation, which are then returned to the system."}, {"heading": "3. Problem Statement", "text": "It is clear from the previous section that there is a lack of research on the automated grading of essay questions in Arabic. The majority of available research results do not fully implement the proposed techniques and often require manual grading by an instructor at a specific point. An efficient automated grading system for Arabic essay questions should prove that it has the following features: fully automated grading capabilities without human intervention, low computer complexity to enable rapid grading and easy implementation for web services that correspond to the nature of online exams. Efficient handling of the various complex aspects in Arabic. This article aims to solve the existing problem by developing an automated essay grading mechanism that is both efficient and less complex for use in online web-based examinations without requiring manual grading."}, {"heading": "4. Automatic Essay Scoring Mechanism", "text": "The answer to this question can be found in two steps: the general structure of the scoring system is presented in Figure (1), which explains the general mechanism of the scoring system. Each question is loaded from the database and displayed along with a form for the student to fill out the answer, the answer is extracted from the form, while the correct answer is retrieved from the database for comparison.4.1 Heavy stemming, also referred to as root-based stemming, begins with a form for the student to extract the answer, while the correct answer is retrieved from the database for comparison.The auto-grading procedure is performed as follows: 2016 International Journal of Computer Science Issuesp 1: Get both questions and the correct answer from the database."}, {"heading": "5.
