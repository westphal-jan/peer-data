As information and communications grow more ubiquitous and more data become available, many security risks arise as well as appetite to manage and mitigate such risks. Consequently, research on applying and designing ML algorithms and systems for security has grown fast, ranging from intrusion detection systems(IDS) and malware classification to security policy management(SPM) and information leak checking. In this paper, we systematically study the methods, algorithms, and system designs in academic publications from 2008-2015 that applied ML in security domains. 98 percent of the surveyed papers appeared in the 6 highest-ranked academic security conferences and 1 conference known for pioneering ML applications in security. We examine the generalized system designs, underlying assumptions, measurements, and use cases in active research. Our examinations lead to 1) a taxonomy on ML paradigms and security domains for future exploration and exploitation, and 2) an agenda detailing open and upcoming challenges. Based on our survey, we also suggest a point of view that treats security as a game theory problem instead of a batch-trained ML problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 05:08:02 GMT  (238kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03186v1", "18 pages, 2 figures, 11 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 2 figures, 11 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["heju jiang", "jasvir nagra", "parvez ahammad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03186"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.03186.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "SoK: Applying Machine Learning in Security - A Survey", "authors": ["Heju Jiang", "Jasvir Nagra", "Parvez Ahammad"], "emails": ["}@instartlogic.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

In different use cases, the system components may embody different names, but their functionalities and positions are captured in the illustration. For example: 1. Knowledge base is based on known normality and / or abnormality, depending on the application, they may include, but are not limited to, blacklist (BL), whitelist (WL), watchlist; known malware signatures, system traces and their families; initial series of malicious websites; existing security policies or regulations, etc. 2. Data sources are where relevant data is collected. They may be either offline or live online data feeding, e.g. malware traces collected after execution (offline), URL stream (online), IT stream (online) and their families; initial set of malicious web pages; or where specific security policies may be collected, etc."}, {"heading": "2.2 ML Paradigms in Security Problems", "text": "In fact, most of them are only a matter of time before they will be able to unfold, until they will be able to unfold, and that they will be able to unfold, until they will be able to unfold, until they are able to unfold."}, {"heading": "2.3 Timeline of ML in Security", "text": "Based on groundbreaking work and facilities in notable places, the gradually growing interest in ML research applied to security is quite evident. Here, we gathered some milestones: 1. 1987: Denning published \"An Intrusion Detection System\" [1], initially Framing Security as a Learning Problem 2. 1998: DARPA IDS design challenge [2] 3. 1999: KDD Cup IDS design challenge [3, 4] 4. 2008: CCS hosted the 1st AISec workshop.

In 2013 [40], they examined the security of server-side web applications, [41] examined data mining on cloud security, focusing on intruder detection, [42] discussed an ML perspective in detecting network anomalies. Although helpful and informative, the former two are limited by scope and perspective, and the latter serves as a textbook, so the quintessence of the survey - mapping the progress and mapping the state of the art - is missing. In a collection of papers from 2002 and 2012 [43], applications of DM in computer security were discussed, but a systematic survey of ML applications in solving security problems is missing. [44] Briefly, two network anomaly detection techniques were compared, while L-scale detection techniques were listed in 2008, but a majority of them were limited to [45] in 2009."}, {"heading": "3. NETWORK SECURITY", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Botnets and Honeypots", "text": "Botnet research in our reviewed literature focuses mainly on the development of command and control (C & C) botnets detection systems, in which many bot-infected machines are controlled and coordinated by a few units to perform malicious activities [47, 48, 49] These systems must learn decision boundaries between human and boot-based activities, so ML-based classifiers are at the core of these systems and are often trained by marked data in monitored learning environments. [47, 48, 49] The most popular classifier is support for vector machines (SVMs) with different cores, while spatio-temporal time series analysis and likely conclusions are also noteworthy techniques used in ML-based classifiers. Topical clustering, mostly in natural language processing (NLP), is used to build a large-scale system to identify bot queries [50]. In 1. Botnet 51-like C, there are mostly three core literatures."}, {"heading": "3.2 Proxies and DNS", "text": "The classification of DNS domains that distribute or host malware, fraud and malicious content has piqued research interest, particularly in passive DNS analysis. There are two main approaches: Reputation System [58, 59, 60] and Classifiers [61, 62]. The Reputation System evaluates benign and malicious domains and DNS hosts, and an ML-based classifier learns boundaries between the two. Nevertheless, both the Reputation System and the Classifier utilize different decision trees, Random Forest (RF), unofficial Bayes (NB), SVM and clustering techniques for largely monitored learning-based scoring and classification. Many of the features used come from protocols and network infrastructures, such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and updates, Automated Systems (AS), Registration, Zone, Hosts and Public BLs."}, {"heading": "4. SECURITY SERVICES", "text": "Both the offensive and the defense for access control, authentication and authorization are within the domain of the security services 71. Defeating audio and visual CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) [67, 68, 68, 67, 70], measuring password strength [72, 74, 75], and detecting anonymity [76, 77, 78, 79] are 4 important use cases. On the other hand, specialized ML domains such as computer vision, signal processing and NLP automation of attacks on user authentication services, i.e. textual or visual passwords and CAPTCHAs, and detection of hidden identities and services. On the defense side are entropy-based and ML-based systems that calculate passwords."}, {"heading": "5. SOFTWARE & APPLICATION SECURITY", "text": "ML research in the field of software and application security in our survey focuses largely on the security of web applications and uses supervised learning to train popular classifiers such as NB and SVM to detect web-based malware and JavaScript (JS) code [83, 84], to filter unwanted resources and requests such as malicious advertising [85, 86, 87, 88], to predict unwanted resources and requests (e.g. future blacklisted websites) [89, 90, 91] and to quantify vulnerabilities of web applications [92]. While [91] the creation of web anomaly detectors has been explored with scarce training data, most use cases follow the supervised paradigm that emanates from abundantly labelled data: data sources (web applications, static / dynamic analyzers) \u2192 have an extraction (often with specific pre-filters, metrics and de-obuscator detections of systems, if the usual detection mechanisms are not available)."}, {"heading": "6.

MALWARE, SOCIAL ENGINEERING & IDS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7.1 Malware Detection and Mitigations", "text": "There are three areas where most ML application research draws attention to malware: malware detection [108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 116, 117, 118, 119], classification of unknown malware in families [31, 120, 121, 123, 124] and auto-extract program or protocol specifications [125, 126, 127]. The realization of signature and heuristic malware detectors can be circumvented by wear and tear and polymorphism [118], more behavioral matching and clustering systems and algorithms have been explored. Figure 1 already shows a generalized ML system design for malware detection and classification, and a more detailed description is below: 1. Gathering malware artifacts and samples that they execute in a controlled virtual environment."}, {"heading": "7.2 Social Engineering: Phishing, Malicious Content and Behaviors", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to protect themselves put themselves in danger if they do not play by the rules."}, {"heading": "7.3 IDS", "text": "While ML can easily be confused with anomalies, the important difference is that ML aims to generalize expert distinctions, but anomaly detection focuses on finding unusual patterns, while attacks are not necessarily abnormal. For example, [148] the n-gram model differs from other use cases: anomaly detection uses it to construct normality (hence it is more appropriate if the anomaly detection results in no attack being available for learning), and ML classifiers learn to distinguish benign from malignant n n gramys (hence it is more appropriate if more labeled data is available)."}, {"heading": "8. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT", "text": "A key goal of our SoK study is to help researchers look to the future. ML applications in security domains attract the attention of academic research, and this represents a valuable opportunity for researchers to navigate the landscapes between ML theories and security applications. There are also opportunities to explore whether the paradigms mentioned are specific security issues."}, {"heading": "9. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we analyzed ML applications in security areas by examining literature from the most important areas of our field between 2008 and early 2016. We tried to shed light on a complex field with overlapping expertise by identifying common use cases, generalized system designs, common assumptions, metrics or features, and ML algorithms used in different security areas. We constructed a matrix that identifies the interfaces of ML paradigms and three different taxonomy structures for classifying security areas, and show that while much research has been done, studies of GT-based ML paradigms and HITL-ML system designs in the context of active attackers are still highly desirable (and underused). We highlight 7 promising areas of research based on our observations, and argue that ML applications in security areas can be powerful, but it is crucial to match the ML designs with the underlying security areas."}, {"heading": "10.
