In this paper, we generalize earlier work by considering a constrained stochastic context free grammar (CSCFG) for modeling patterns confined to a roadmap. The constrained grammar facilitates modeling specific directions and road names in a roadmap. We present a novel particle filtering algorithm that exploits the CSCFG model for estimating the target\u2019s patterns. This meta-level algorithm operates in conjunction with a base-level tracking algorithm. Extensive numerical results using simulated ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar measurements show substantial improvement in target tracking accuracy.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
