Scope of Internet of Things", "text": "The literature presents various ways to define the Internet of Things. RFID Group defines the Internet of Things as \"a global network of networked objects that are uniquely addressable, based on standardized communication protocols.\" ITU [4] defines it as \"a global infrastructure for the information society that enables advanced services by connecting (physical and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies.\" Taking into account the general vision of IoT communication, this paper focuses on the perspective of networked things and applications for these things. To do so, we simply create a separation of concerns between the fragmented lower layers of IoT's Open System Interconnection (OSI) and the unifying upper layers of IoT communication that the World Wide Web and its standard network protocols.The entire IoT system consists of sensors (temperature, light, motion, etc.), interfaces, actuators (actuators), and motors (T)."}, {"heading": "B. Scope of Chatbots", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to understand the world and understand it as it is, are able to understand themselves."}, {"heading": "A. Challenges in IoT", "text": "Despite widespread efforts to popularize IoT, it still presents many practical challenges. Primarily, IoT systems operate in isolated technology or vendor-specific silos that impede the ability, value and interoperability and create a distant area [15]. In particular, the limitation of heterogeneous devices (home appliances, mobile phones, embedded devices, etc.), sensors and services that communicate with each other over networked networks hampers the possibilities of countless applications.Second, the sheer number of networked things has already begun to create problems in application, device and data management in the IoT [16]. To address this problem, IoT platforms (such as Cisco IoT, IBM IoT, Microsoft Azure IoT, AWS IoT) offer scalable, distributed cloud-based services that allow companies to quickly connect to an established infrastructure, service or software without having to address the complexity of the backend of the IoT object, which is a multifaceted object."}, {"heading": "B.
