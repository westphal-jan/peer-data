They are usually carried out in a closed laboratory environment. Elements of the query process in this type of experiment are controlled by the researchers in order to identify and resolve the causes of success or failure. Language corpora are one of the most important elements for experiments on information retrieval in particular and natural language processing in general, because the corpus represents the actual daily use of the language. On-demand use of the corpus has improved markedly in most languages, particularly in Latin. As for the Arabic language, it is still relatively new. Arabic is the language of the Holy Koran. It is used by more than a half billion Muslims throughout the world in daily rituals."}, {"heading": "1. https://www.gnu.org/software/wget", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2. https://www.httrack.com", "text": "3. https: / / www.internetdownloadmanager.com 4. http: / / www.cyotek.com / cyotek-webcopyCorpora still needs more research and studies. There is an ongoing need for more Arabic corpora. The majority of the corpora available today is relatively small or rather expensive. The main purpose of this work is to produce a new free corpus. A corpus with a large format representative of the language, from different countries, different writing styles, from more than one source and distributed over many years. It will be available to researchers in the fields of information extraction, computer linguistics and natural language processing."}, {"heading": "2 Available Arabic Corpora:", "text": "Table one shows some of the earlier temptations to create Arabic corpora. It should be noted that the review will be limited to textual monolingual corpora, not to word lists, lexicographs, speech and opinion corpora. All kinds have been reviewed by Zaghouani, (2014)."}, {"heading": "3 Data Collection:", "text": "The researchers used wget (1), which is used by the LDC, and htttrack (2), the copier of the website, but both were very slow, so they were not used. Two other programs, Internet Download Manager (3), cyotek webcopy (4), were also used and eliminated because they stopped working for no apparent reason, in addition to their slowness. After several attempts, the researcher used MetaProducts Offline Explorer Pro (5), Visual Web Ripper (6). Both programs were very good at extracting text and eliminating all unnecessary objects such as images, videos, JavaScript files and CSS files.3.1 Corpus Sources: There are a lot of news sources that could be used to create a speech corpus."}, {"heading": "5. http://www.metaproducts.com/mp/offline_explorer_pro.htm", "text": "The fame of the site, and the news source, or the number of readers were not the criterion for selection. There were other criteria and technical reasons for selecting the news resources used in building the Corpus. The first criterion is that there is no overlap with previous Arab corporations. This is simply to have available a large volume of articles originating from Egypt, the largest digital news archive on the Internet, but not selected because it is part of the Arab giant Corpus."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "The main purpose of this corpus is to have a free tool for the Arabic language available to researchers. It is specifically designed for work in the field of gathering information or processing natural language.The corpus is not limited to one topic. It is a multi-topic news corpus covering politics, literature, art, technology, sports, business, culture and many other topics. It is also a good representation of the Arabic language. It covers a period of fourteen years and eight countries. These countries have a very large proportion of Arabic native speakers. Finally, all ten sources used in the creation of the corpus are well illustrated.Table three shows the statistics of the corpus in detail and what was compiled from each source of ten sources. It includes the number and percentage of articles imported from each source, and the total number and unique words for each source. It was arranged on the basis that the number of words between the individual sources is equal; because they should be determined for the total number of words."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "According to Mansour's principles (2013), large, should have a specific purpose, 8. http: / / unicode.org / resources / utf8.htmldiverse, representative, and well balanced.

Table four, shows the gen-eral statistics of the corpus (Al-Thubaity, 2014), that thecorpus has over five million articles from ten newssources. The total number of words exceeds 1.5 billion words, and the total number of uniquewords exceeds the number of words used in individual countries."}], "references": [{"title": "Comparison of topic identification methods for Arabic language", "author": ["M.
