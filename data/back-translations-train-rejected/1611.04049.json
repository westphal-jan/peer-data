An Overview of the Proposed Machine Learning System", "text": "The overall goal of the proposed machine learning system is to predict the time until the start of SSI using spatio-temporal matrix data. There are several major data challenges that need to be overcome, such as the merging of complete samples and censored samples, missing values in spatio-temporal matrices, and the complex reciprocal interaction structure of spatio-temporal matrices. To mitigate these challenges, Figure 2 illustrates an overall scheme of the proposed machine learning system. It consists of a novel modeling formulation to merge both complete samples and censored samples, using limited matrix completion to mitigate the missing data problem. In addition, the learning formulation is equipped with model regularization techniques such as image-based formalism and sparse learning to mitigate the challenges posed by the high dimensionality of the spatio-temporal matrix and the use of its intemporal and spatial structure."}, {"heading": "3.2. Learning Formulation for Data Fusion", "text": "Describe the i-th spatio-temporal data sample in the training data as xi > R > T \u00b7 P, where T denotes the length of the observations and P denotes the number of dynamic variables (such as those wound-related variables) that are collected. Note that the optimal length of the observations T is not a known parameter here. Rather, it should be determined using data-driven methods described in Section 4. As we have already mentioned, our training data consists of both complete samples and censored samples. We use it to denote the index set of complete samples, and use it to denote the index set of censored samples. Missing data refers to the missing elements in the matrix xi. Furthermore, we use yi to denote the time to develop SSI for the sample when that sample is in hand, or the duration of the observations when the sample is i in hand."}, {"heading": "3.3. Bilinear Formulation for Spatial-Temporal Matrix", "text": "Note that the model proposed above does not impose any structure on the model parameters w, ignoring the fact that the input data is a spatio-temporal matrix with an inherent correlation structure in both dimensions. Here, we propose to use a bilinear formulation to grasp the correlation structure within the spatio-temporal matrix, which is inspired by the success of the bilinear models in a field of application such as [24, 26]. Specifically, the predictive model can be rewritten here by using the bilinear formulation as < xi, w > + b \u2212 yi = R \u2211 r xvr + b \u2212 yi, (2) where u-RT \u00d7 R and v-RP \u00d7 R are rewritten with ur and vr their respective rth columns."}, {"heading": "3.4.

Bounded Matrix Completion (BMC)", "text": "In this section, we will develop a matrix completion approach to mitigate the problem of missing data in our problem. Missing data has been ubiquitous in many healthcare applications. We found no exception in our study, as data is collected from patients and compliance with data collection is always a challenge for many reasons. We propose to use the matrix completion approach to fill in the missing values rather than using simple heuristic approaches, such as using averages to replace the missing values. Our reasoning, again, is that the correlations in the spatio-time matrix essentially imply that the spatio-time matrix is low. For example, some variables used to measure the wound could be correlated, such as the color and temperature of the wound. Due to this reason, by using their correlations, we could recover many missing values as long as we have observed some values in the matrix, in order to take advantage of this idea that there are some mental factors related to the individual observation there."}, {"heading": "3.6. Missing Value Estimation for the Testing Data", "text": "As shown in the previous section, the BMC formulation is used to supplement the missing values in the training data. It is based on learning a few base vectors Ui's, and then, for each incomplete observation vector Tn, t, the algorithm attempts to identify the optimal weights that can best correspond to the projected vector \u2211 r = 1 \u03b1iUi with Tn, t, where U = [U1, U2,..., Ur] is achieved by applying SVD to the learned low-rank implantation matrix: M = U\u0432 V. Then the missing values in Tn, t can be filled in by the corresponding elements in \u0445r i = 1 \u03b1iUi. Thus, it is easy to use the results from the BMC formulation that we learned from the training algorithm 2 Bounded Matrix Completion (BMC)."}, {"heading": "4. Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1. Study population", "text": "A prospective cohort study of 1,000 patients with open abdominal surgery was conducted in an academic teaching hospital with 1200 beds in the Netherlands previously described [30]. Patients who did not undergo surgery (n = 33) or with < 2 days of wound observation (n = 107) were excluded from the analysis, resulting in a total of 860 patients being affected. Subjects were prospectively examined for CDC-defined superficial, deep and / or organ space infections [9]. Surface SSI infections are infections that occur within 30 days of surgery and which affect only skin or subcutaneous tissue of the incision and at least one of the following: 1) discharge from the incision, with or without confirmation by laboratory tests; 2) organisms that are isolated from an aseptic culture or aspiration of the incision; 3) at least one of the following signs or subcutaneous tissue of the incision and symptoms: an infection or redness, or sensitivity, or a facial infection; 3) at least one of the following signs or subcutaneous tissue of the incision or symptoms is present; 3) an infection or a recurrent infection, or a recurrence, or sensitivity, or a recurrence, or a recurrence, or a recurrence, or a recurrence, or a recurrence, or a recurrence of an infection."}, {"heading": "4.2. Data collection", "text": "Subjects in the dataset were examined daily using a previously described protocol [31], from the second day after surgery to discharge or 21 days, whichever was earlier, followed by 30 days of follow-up by hospital visit, telephone or letter to determine infection after discharge. Table 3 shows the dynamic wound data collected, including the definition of categorical wound score variables [31]. For analysis purposes, we defined the SSI group as one of the three types of SSI due to the low number of infections in depth and organ space. Furthermore, a patient may have developed several SSI types during the observation period, but we only include their initial infection in this analysis. The non-SSI group was defined as having not developed any type of infection, but may have had an infection after discharge. For patients who did not develop SSI during the observation period, their observation day is 21. For patients who are represented during the observation period of their SSI summarizing the statistical period developed in their SSI."}, {"heading": "3 5 7 8.244 11 21", "text": "Yes, Figure 3 schematically illustrates the process by which we have translated the original data into the data structure used by the proposed machine learning system.

For each proposed model, we repeat the training / test procedure five times to ensure that each set is used once as test data. We use the mean absolute prediction error (MAE), i.e. we use the mean absolute prediction error, i.e. we evaluate the predictiveness of each model in predicting the deployment period of individuals."}, {"heading": "4.4. Comparison with other models", "text": "We compare our proposed learning system with closely related benchmark approaches. The first is the classical regression model [32], which assumes linear and additive predictive effects of the predictors on a continuous outcome variable. It has been used in many risk forecasting models in a wide range of applications. Comparing the performance of these models is in Figures 4 and 5. Note that Figure 4 is a more robust model than the classical regression model, essentially reflecting the weight of the censored samples in the learning formulation. As we have an unbalanced dataset using weights to balance the contribution of both full and censored samples, Figure 4 was a common approach in using the existing methods. Figures 4 and 5 show that our methods work significantly better than both benchmark methods across the overall results that we agree on this method = Even if we agree, it is a better method for evaluating the 2."}, {"heading": "4.5. Evaluation of the matrix completion method for missing data imputation", "text": "Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the matrix completion method for missing data imputation compared to other methods. For example, the \"column mean\" method to supplement the missing value on characteristic j of the individual i at a given time may use the mean value of characteristic j of all individuals over all time points based on the observed measurements. Other methods we use for comparison include the K-NearestNeighbor (KNN) method, which is widely used for missing data imputation [34, 35] and a more recent Bayesian approach [36]. We train the models using various methods to import missing data at different values of \u03bb and report the results, as shown in Figure 6. It clearly shows that our low-level matrix completion method could lead to superior performance in missing data imputation, thereby achieving better predictive performance of the model."}, {"heading": "4.6. Optimal configuration of the proposed learning system", "text": "In order to determine the optimal configuration of the proposed learning system, we build a sequence of models to examine the performance of different configurations. Among these critical parameters, the duration of the dynamic data that we could use to build the predictive model, the rank of the model parameters w and the value of \u03bb. Among these parameters, the duration of the dynamic data is probably the most important parameter. Obviously, there is a trade-off between accuracy and cost. In the longer term, more information could be collected that will lead to better predictive accuracy. On the other hand, it will lead to higher costs, not only in data collection, but also in health costs due to the potential delay in the identification of patients who will soon develop SSI. Therefore, it is a practical and important decision to find an appropriate length for observation and prediction. Here, based on the cross-validation with the training ratio set to 4: 1, the predictive performance of the models show in table 4. This shows that the dynamical results could be worse than those of 5 days, if the model is built to be the best of 5 days."}, {"heading": "5.

healthcare research. Much research attention has been attracted to develop better SSI risk prediction models. However, most of the existing SSI risk prediction models are built on static risk factors such as comorbidities and operative factors. In this paper, we investigate the use of the dynamic wound data for SSI risk prediction. There have been emerging mobile health (mHealth) tools that can closely monitor the patients and generate continuous measurements of many wound-related variables and other evolving clinical variables. Since existing prediction models of SSI have quite limited capacity to utilize the evolving clinical data, we develop the corresponding solution to equip these mHealth tools with decision-making capabilities for SSI prediction with a seamless assembly of several machine learning models to tackle the analytic challenges arising from the spatial-temporal data. The basic idea is to exploit the low-rank property of the spatial-temporal data via the bilinear formulation, and further enhance it with automatic missing data imputation by the matrix completion technique. We derive efficient optimization algorithms to implement these models and demonstrate the superior performances of our new predictive model on a real-world dataset of SSI, compared to a range of state-of-the-art methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
