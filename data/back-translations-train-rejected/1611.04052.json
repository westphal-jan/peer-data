FRAME AND FRAME ELEMENT", "text": "A frame is a collection of facts that indicate \"characteristic features, attributes, and functions of a person, and their characteristic interactions with the things that are necessary or typically associated with them.\" (Cruse, 2001) The semantic framework comes from the frame semantics that Charles J. Fillmore's Fall Grammar (Fillmore, 1968) extends from linguistic semantics to encyclopedic knowledge. The basic idea is that \"meanings are relativized to scenes\" (Fillmore, 1977). That is, one cannot understand the meaning of a single word without access to that word."}, {"heading": "3. A CASE STUDY", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Data and experiment", "text": "The video, transcription and reference text translation of this inaugural address are all easily available online. The video of the Chinese interpreting from a senior interpreter (professional interpreter) is also available in open source.The senior interpreter works for Phoenix Television, a Hong Kong-based television program in Mandarin and Cantonese. We got their interpreting sound from the Phoenix TV website (http: / / v.ifeng.com) and transcribed and transcribed its MinE and MaxE. Our experiment begins with the frame and RE notes of the transcriptions of Obama's speech and the voice of the senior interpreter. We compared the frames and FEs of input and output and evaluated his MinE and MaxE. Then we evaluated three more outputs from junior interpreters (interpreters) and compared them with the scores of senior interpreters to see the efficiency of this method. We also compare the EU scores of their human interpreters and their Boring-LE and their human scores."}, {"heading": "3.2. Annotation", "text": "We commented on the semantic framework and their FEs manually because either there is no reliable semantic role commentator or the fluent simultaneous interpretation is not suitable for the state-of-the-art semantic commentator. As a pilot study, we should provide the gold standard of test data. In total, there are 87 sentences in the source text transcribed from the speech. We commented on these sentences, which resemble the Frame Net commentary; for example, the source sentence 20 (SS20) can be commented on as Figure 2. In the following notes, LUs are highlighted and FEs are bracketed and marketed. SS20: No one can train all math and science teachers, we must equip our children for the future or build the roads and networks and research laboratories that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores.

Correlation with human scoring", "text": "To measure the correlation of semantic scoring metrics with human judgment and n-gram-based BLEU score at sentence level, we use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to measure the correlation of semantic scoring metrics with human judgment. We invite a professional interpreter (English to Chinese) as a judge to evaluate all results of reference interpreters, lead interpreters, three junior interpreters and MT. We obtained the reference from an open source website for language acquisition (http: / / news.iciba.com / study / listen / 1554958.shtml) and MT output from Google Translate. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient can be calculated using the following equation:) 1 (6 122 \u2212 = 0 d i (7), where di is the difference between the ranks of assessment metrics and human judgment."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "\"Translating means translating meaning.\" (Nida, 1986) \"Compared to text translation, interpreting has less characteristic features such as genre (literature or technology?), culture (domestication or alienation?), sociological factors (post-colony or feminism?). The only thing interpreters focus on is transferring the meaning of the speaker's speech to the audience. In terms of linguistic structure, interpreting, especially simultaneous interpreting, leaves the interpreters in the booth little time to organize their results in the normal way that the target languages do. They always present their translation as the source language. Therefore, the meaning-oriented and less reordered evaluation metrics offer the possibility of automatically and semantically evaluating interpreting."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work is partly supported by the Centre of Translation Studies of GDUFS (grant no.: CTS201501) and the Open Project Program of National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (grant no.: 201407353)."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Increasing interpreting needs a more objective and automatic measurement.
