We use this uniqueness, together with the well-known polynomial tree intersection time tracking algorithm, to design a polynomial tree intersection time tracking algorithm for weakly single tree intersection profiles. We have also shown that the query complexity for detecting preferences for weakly single tree intersection profiles is small - the query complexity boundaries are similar to the corresponding boundaries for single peak [Con09] and single intersection profiles [DM16b]. Furthermore, we have shown that our preference determination algorithm enables an optimal number of queries to constant factors for a large number of selectors. Therefore, our results in this paper are similar to the fact that the weakly single tree intersection domain inherits the most desirable properties from individual tree cross profiles."}], "references": [{"title": "Bypassing combinatorial protections: Polynomial-time algorithms for singlepeaked electorates", "author": ["Felix Brandt", "Markus Brill", "Edith Hemaspaandra", "Lane A Hemaspaandra"], "venue": "J.

We call this domain the weakly single crossing domain on trees. It is known that most of the desirable properties of the single crossing domain on trees continue to hold for the weakly single crossing domain on trees. In this paper, we prove several interesting structural properties of the weakly single crossing domain on trees and exploit them to design efficient algorithms for recognizing and eliciting weakly single crossing preference profiles on trees. In particular, we begin with showing that, for every weakly single crossing preference profile P on trees, there exists a unique inclusion-minimal set of preference orderings Q whose inclusion in P makes the resulting profile P = P \u228eQ single crossing with respect to some tree. We call the profile P the closure of P. Using this uniqueness of closure property of weakly single crossing preference profiles on trees and the known recognition algorithm of single crossing preference profiles on trees due to Clearwater et al. [CPS15], we design a polynomial time algorithm for recognizing weakly single crossing profiles on trees.
