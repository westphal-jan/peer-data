THE DESIGN OF THE NOESIS FRAMEWORK", "text": "NOESIS is designed as an easily expandable framework, whose architecture forms the basis for the implementation of network data mining techniques. To achieve this, NOESIS is designed for abstract interfaces and a number of core classes that provide basic functionality, enabling the implementation of different features into independent components with strong cohesion and loose coupling. NOESIS components are designed to be maintainable and reusable."}, {"heading": "A. System architecture", "text": "The lowest component is the hardware abstraction layer (HAL), which provides support for executing algorithms in a parallel environment, concealing implementation details and much of the underlying technical complexity, and provides various building blocks for implementing well-researched parallel programming patterns, such as MapReduce (Dean and Ghemawat, 2008). For example, we would result = (duplicate) parallel.reduce (Index - > x [Index] * y [Index], ADD, 0, SIZE-1) to calculate the dot product of two vectors in parallel. HAL not only implements structured parallel programming patterns, but is also responsible for task scheduling and parallel execution. It allows for adjusting parallel execution parameters, including task scheduling algorithms. The reflective kernel is at the core of NOESIS and provides its most important properties (unified)."}, {"heading": "B. Core classes", "text": "The core classes and interfaces shown in Figure 2 form the basis for implementing different types of networks with specific spatial and computational requirements. Basic network operations include adding and removing nodes, adding and removing nodes, or querying node neighborhoods. More complex operations are provided by specialized components. NOESIS supports networks with attributes both in their nodes and in their nodes. These attributes are defined using predefined data models, including categorical and numerical values."}, {"heading": "C. Supported data formats", "text": "NOESIS supports reading and writing network data sets using the most common data formats. For example, the GDF file format is a CSV-like format used by some software tools such as GUESS and Gephi. It supports attributes in both nodes and associations. Another file format supported is GML, which stands for Graph Modeling Language. GML is a hierarchical ASCII-based file format. GraphML is another hierarchical file format based on XML, the ubiquitous eXtensible Markup Language developed by W3C. Other file formats are supported by NOESIS, such as the Pajek file format, which resembles GDF, or the file format of the records of the Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP) (Read kovec and Krevl, 2014)."}, {"heading": "D. Graphical user interface", "text": "In order to allow users without programming knowledge to use most of the NOESIS functions, the standard NOESIS frame distribution comes with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. The NOESIS GUI allows non-technical end users to load, visualize and analyze their own network data sets using all the techniques provided with NOESIS. Some screenshots of this GUI are in Figure 3. A canvas is used to represent the network at any moment. The network can be manipulated by clicking or dragging nodes. At the top of the window, a menu provides access to various options and data mining algorithms. The Network menu allows loading a network from an external source and exporting the results using different file formats, as well as creating images of the current network visualization both as raster and vector graphic images. The View menu also allows customization of the network visual appearance by specifying the layout and binary attributes of the settings."}, {"heading": "III. NETWORK ANALYSIS TOOLS", "text": "NOESIS is designed to simplify the implementation of network analysis tools. It also includes reusable implementations of a wide range of popular network-related techniques, from graph visualization (Tamassia, 2013) and common graph algorithms to network structural properties (Newman, 2010) and network building models (Jackson, 2008). The network analysis tools included in NOESIS and the modules that implement them are presented in this section."}, {"heading": "A. Network models", "text": "NOESIS implements a number of popular random network generation models, which are described by probability distributions or random processes. Such models have proven useful for studying and understanding certain characteristics or behaviors observed in real networks. Among the models included in NOESIS, the Erdo-sRe-nyi model (Erdo-s and Re- \u0301 nyi, 1959) is one of the simplest. Gilbert's model (Gilbert, 1959) is similar, but a probability of existence is given instead for linkages. The anchored network model is also similar to the two previous models, with the advantage of reducing the occurrence of isolated nodes, but at the expense of being less than completely random. Finally, the linked random model is a variation of the anchored model that avoids isolated nodes. Other models included in NOESIS exhibit specific characteristics that are often found in real networks."}, {"heading": "B. Structural properties of networks", "text": "They can be used, for example, to measure the robustness of the network or to show important nodes and links. NOESIS considers three types of structural properties that can be calculated for nodes: for example, indegree and out-degree, indicate the number of incoming and outgoing links, respectively, the global properties. NOESIS offers a large number of techniques to measure the structural properties of the network that were included in the analysis: biased (Piraveenan et al., 2008) and unbiased (Piraveenan et al., 2010) Node-degree assortativity is a score between \u2212 1 and 1 that measures the degree correlation between the pairs of connected nodes. Clustering coefficients can also be calculated for nodes."}, {"heading": "FileReader fileReader =", "text": "new FileReader (\"karate.gml\");"}, {"heading": "NetworkReader reader =", "text": "new GMLNetworkReader (fileReader); Network network = reader.read (); PageRank task = new PageRank (network); NodeScore score = task.call (); Different structural properties for links can also be calculated by NOESIS. For example, the link difference, the number of shortest paths the connection is involved in, or the link rays, the number of possible paths between two nodes crossing a given connection, some of which are used by different network data mining algorithms."}, {"heading": "C. Network visualization techniques", "text": "The visualization of networks is a complex task, as networks tend to be huge, with thousands of nodes and links. NOESIS enables the visualization of networks by providing the functionality required to render the network and export the resulting visualization using different image file formats. NOESIS offers various automatic diagram layout techniques, such as the well-known Fruchterman pure gold (Fruchterman and pure gold, 1991) and Kamada-Kawai (Kamada and Kawai, 1989) force-based layout algorithms. Force-based layout algorithms detect forces between nodes and release the system to achieve an equilibrium point that normally leads to an aesthetic visualization. Hierarchical layouts (Tamassia, 2013) that arrange force-based layouts in layers that attempt to minimize edge crossings are also included."}, {"heading": "IV. NETWORK DATA MINING TECHNIQUES", "text": "Network data mining techniques exist for both unattended and monitored environments. NOESIS includes a wide range of community detection methods (Lancichinetti and Fortunato, 2009) and link prediction techniques (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg, 2007), which are briefly described below."}, {"heading": "A. Community detection", "text": "There is a wide range of methods for detecting communities, their temporal complexity and their bibliographic references in the table I.NOESIS offers hierarchical cluster algorithms. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering treats each nodea as a cluster, and then iteratively clusters are merged until all nodes are in the same cluster group (Fortunato, 2010). Different strategies for selecting clusters for merging have been implemented, including single link (Sibson, 1973), which selects the two clusters with the smallest minimum distance; full linkage (Defays, 1977), which selects the two clusters with the smallest maximum distance."}, {"heading": "FileReader fileReader =", "text": "new FileReader (\"mynetwork.net\");"}, {"heading": "NetworkReader reader =", "text": "new PajekNetworkReader (fileReader);"}, {"heading": "Network network = reader.read();", "text": "CommunityDetector task = new NJWCommunityDetector (network);"}, {"heading": "Matrix results = task.call();", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "B. Link scoring and prediction", "text": "Most linking techniques obtain this value by taking into account the overlap or relationship between the neighborhood of the nodes at both ends of the linkage. On the other hand, linking the linkage considers a value, weight or probability that corresponds to the probability of the existence of a particular linkage according to a specific model of linkage. NOESIS framework offers a large collection of methods for linking linkages and linkages, from local methods that only take into account the immediate neighborhood of nodes, to global methods that take into account the entire network topology. As the amount of information collected increases, the computational and spatial complexity of the techniques increases as well. Linking scoring and prediction methods available in NOESIS are listed in Table II. Among the local methods, the most basic technique is the common score (Newman, 2001), which is equal to the number of common neighbors between the two linkages."}, {"heading": "Network network =", "text": "new BarabasiAlbertNetwork (100, 1000);"}, {"heading": "LinkPredictionScore method =", "text": "new ResourceAllocationScore (network); matrix result = method.call ();"}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Currently, the NOESIS project comprises more than 35,000 lines of code organized into hundreds of classes and dozens of packages. NOESIS relies on a library of reusable components that, with more than 40,000 lines of Java code, provides an adaptable framework for collecting, supporting the execution of parallel algorithms, mathematical routines, and the model-driven application generator to build the graphical user interface of NOESIS. NOESIS facilitates the development of applications that analyze any type of data that can be presented as a network. NOESIS provides an efficient, scalable, and developer-friendly framework for data mining network data, which is released under a generous license for the Berkeley Software Distribution.
