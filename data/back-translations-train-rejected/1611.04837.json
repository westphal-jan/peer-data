To approximate human-like coding schema, we introduce a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies each location word to be either correct or incorrect. We use news articles collected from around the world (Integrated Crisis Early Warning System [ICEWS] data and Open Event Data Alliance [OEDA] data) to test our algorithm that consists of two stages. In the feature selection stage, we extract contextual information from texts, namely, the N-gram patterns for location words, the frequency of mention, and the context of the sentences containing location words. In the classification stage, we use three classifiers to estimate the model parameters in the training set and then to predict whether a location word in the test set news articles is the place of the event. The validation results show that our algorithm improves the accuracy rate of the current geolocation methods of dictionary approach by as much as 25%.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 20:50:03 GMT  (1718kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04837v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sophie j lee", "howard liu", "michael d ward"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04837"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.04837.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "LOST IN SPACE: GEOLOCATION IN EVENT DATA", "authors": ["SOPHIE J.

INTRODUCTION Many quantitative studies on conflicts are obviously based on event data. Recently, these studies have also returned to the country-year framework and have focused on the disaggregation of event flows in terms of both space and time. Disaggregation of temporality - even on the day-to-day level - is an easy task, but finding exactly where an event actually occurred is a difficult and uncertain task that has confused most contemporary event data (Boschee et al. 2015), PHOENIX (OEDA 2016), SCAD 2015), ACLED et al. 2010. At the same time, there is widespread interest in disentangling investigations from the national framework. The country-year - as an observation framework - has a long tradition in political science."}, {"heading": "9.

Much of this deeper dive is coming from organizations and governments in terms of their reporting on demographic, economic, financial, and health data that are subnational. Most data in the conflict realm comes from non-offical sources. For many that means some form of data collected from historical and journalistic sources. This need is often filled by event data, which are typically collected on a daily basis, and can be aggregated temporally to the level required by the analysis. Event data can also be aggregated to the geographical region that is appropriate. Given the increasing demands for event data, the scientific community has recently devoted significant efforts to automate the data collection process. Having humans read and code a large set of archive documents sometimes limits reproducibility, and hence hinders scientific research. It is also expensive and limits the currency of the data. Further, ensuring inter-coder reliability is challenging, especially over global events that span decades. Several efforts utilize machine-coding to collect event information and determine event features automatically. Projects such as the Integrated Crisis EarlyWarning System (ICEWS) (Boschee et al. 2015; Lautenschlager et al. 2015; O\u2019Brien 2010) and the Open Source Event Data Alliance 2016 are two prominent examples.

Despite the difficulty in interpreting the results, it is an all-purpose approach that performs well on most problems (Lantz 2013). These classifiers boast two primary strengths. The first is that they do not require prespecifying the type of relationship between the covariates and the response variable. They are powerful information extraction tools that can capture underlying relationships not explained by known structures (Jones & Linder 2015; Lantz 2013; G\u00fcnther & Fritsch 1998; Beck et al. 2000). Second, these models achieve accurate prediction rates given large enough input sizes (Maroco et al. 2011; Hsieh et al. 2011; Beck et al. 2000).

To approximate human-like coding schema, we introduce a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies each location word to be either correct or incorrect. We use news articles collected from around the world (Integrated Crisis Early Warning System [ICEWS] data and Open Event Data Alliance [OEDA] data) to test our algorithm that consists of two stages. In the feature selection stage, we extract contextual information from texts, namely, the N-gram patterns for location words, the frequency of mention, and the context of the sentences containing location words. In the classification stage, we use three classifiers to estimate the model parameters in the training set and then to predict whether a location word in the test set news articles is the place of the event. The validation results show that our algorithm improves the accuracy rate of the current geolocation methods of dictionary approach by as much as 25%.
