Due to its rather simple syntax paired with high-performance solvers, ASP is interesting for industrial applications. However, to err is human and thus debugging is an important activity during the development process. Therefore, tools for debugging non-ground answer set programs are needed. In this paper, we present a new graphical debugging interface for non-ground answer set programs. The tool is based on the recently-introduced DWASP approach for debugging and it simplifies the interaction with the debugger. Furthermore, the debugging interface is integrated in ASPIDE, a rich IDE for answer set programs. With our extension ASPIDE turns into a full-fledged IDE by offering debugging support.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 18:11:43 GMT  (190kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04969v1", "Paper presented at the 1st Workshop on Trends and Applications of Answer Set Programming (TAASP 2016), Klagenfurt, Austria, 26 September 2016, 15 pages, LaTeX, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper presented at the 1st Workshop on Trends and Applications of Answer Set Programming (TAASP 2016), Klagenfurt, Austria, 26 September 2016, 15 pages, LaTeX, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["philip gasteiger", "carmine dodaro", "benjamin musitsch", "kristian reale", "francesco ricca", "konstantin schekotihin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04969"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.04969.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An integrated Graphical User Interface for Debugging Answer Set Programs", "authors": ["Philip Gasteiger", "Carmine Dodaro", "Benjamin Musitsch", "Kristian Reale", "Francesco Ricca", "Konstantin Schekotihin"], "emails": ["firstname.lastname@aau.at", "lastname@mat.unical.it"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Answer Set Programming, ASP, debugging, graphical debugging"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have given themselves, and they will be able to play by the rules they have given themselves."}, {"heading": "2 Answer Set Programming", "text": "In this section, we will recall the syntax and semantics of response set programming.

We also present the communication protocol between the GUI and the debugger. Finally, we introduce the integration with an integrated development environment for ASP, called ASPIDE [15]. Our system consists of three components: GRINGO-WRAPPER - the debugging grounder, the solver DWASP and the graphical user interface DWASP-GUI, as shown in Fig. 1. The user interacts with DWASP-GUI and provides a program and a test case T. If the test case fails, i.e. the solver DWASP is incoherent, a new debugging session is started."}, {"heading": "4.1 User Interface DWASP-GUI", "text": "A screenshot of the DWASP GUI is shown in Fig. 2. In the workspace view and in the test case view, all files containing the program encodings or test cases are listed. Furthermore, the query view (due to space limitations of the GUI) contains a maximum of nine atoms, the truth values of which are requested by the user. The user answers a query by either ticking or cross-checking the button and clicking Send. Afterwards, DWASP recalculates the unsatisfactory core and presents the results to the user. When debugging a program, all rules contained in the current unsatisfactory core are highlighted in red. If you hover the cursor over such a rule, all substitutions and basic versions of the rules are displayed in a popup.3 Note that simplifications of GRINGO are disabled [10]."}, {"heading": "4.2 Integration with ASPIDE", "text": "We integrated the DWASP GUI graphical user interface into the ASPIDE integrated development environment [15]. The test and debugging workflow is illustrated by the program shown in Example 1. In Fig. 3, we present a screenshot of ASPIDE with a workspace where the program is loaded. The test case some _ model.test uses an assertion from ASPIDE [14] that checks if there is a response. When running the test case some _ model.test, the IDE tells us that the test case has failed, as shown in Fig. 4. To start the DWASP system, we click the Debug button. Now we get the DWASP-GUI interface as shown in Fig. 5, where we debug the faulty program as described in the previous section. Finally, we click Back to ASPIDE, which brings us back to ASPIDE, highlighting the faulty rule as well."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to leave the country without being able to leave it."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The new interface improves the user experience when debugging ASP programs with DWASP, a process that was previously only possible via a command-line interface. In fact, in addition to the usual advantages offered by visual tools, the query function is much more user-friendly, since the user can simply select answers by clicking on specific buttons, and multiple possible answers are presented to the user in a convenient list. Multiple test cases can easily be loaded into the interface, and multiple debugging sessions can be run seamlessly on the same cases as needed. Problematic rules are also outlined immediately in the text editor, so that the user is immediately notified of errors from the interface."}], "references": [{"title": "Optimization Methods for the Partner Units Problem", "author": ["M.

Due to its rather simple syntax paired with high-performance solvers, ASP is interesting for industrial applications. However, to err is human and thus debugging is an important activity during the development process. Therefore, tools for debugging non-ground answer set programs are needed. In this paper, we present a new graphical debugging interface for non-ground answer set programs. The tool is based on the recently-introduced DWASP approach for debugging and it simplifies the interaction with the debugger. Furthermore, the debugging interface is integrated in ASPIDE, a rich IDE for answer set programs. With our extension ASPIDE turns into a full-fledged IDE by offering debugging support.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
