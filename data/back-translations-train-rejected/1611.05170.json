RELATED WORK", "text": "This year, there has only been one time in history when there has been such a process."}, {"heading": "3. MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION", "text": "In many cases, these goals are defined in non-comparable units and have a certain level of conflict between them. In other words, a goal cannot be improved without worsening another goal [15]. In an optimization problem with a goal, this scenario can be illustrated by a user who wants to select a subset of intelligent objects, but also wants to minimize the price and maximize the accuracy of the sensors in that subset. In an optimization problem with one goal, the search space is always well defined. As several conflicting goals must be optimized simultaneously, it is extremely difficult to find a single optimal solution, but rather a set of options with the same quality. The optimal solution is a set of optimal goal conflicts [2]. A multi-objective optimization problem can be described as asminimize {f1 (x), f2 (x), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 fk (x), where x \u00b7 the number of functions \u00b7 k (greater than the decision) (x) is defined by x."}, {"heading": "3.1 Pareto Optimality", "text": "In the case of a minimization problem, a solution xT is not dominated if there is no x-S, so fi (x) \u2264 fi (xT) for each lens = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, k e fi (x) < fi (xT) for at least one of the objectives analyzed [2]. The image of the set of optimal solutions is called the Pareto limit or Pareto curve. The shape of the Pareto front indicates the type of exchange between different objective functions [5]. Each target can be minimized or minimized. The fixed curve represents the set of non-dominated solutions. This figure is the optimal set of Pareto, which is always composed of solutions concentrated in a particular vertex of a viable region."}, {"heading": "3.2 Multiple-criteria decision analysis", "text": "The MCDA algorithm is designed to support the assessment of decision-making through a set of objectives and criteria by estimating their importance and determining the contribution of each option in relation to a set of criteria. [10] An MCDA problem can be described using an M \u00d7 N analysis matrix in which the qij element represents the performance of each option according to the cj decision criteria in non-comparable units and scales as represented by Equation 3. An evaluation matrix is used to represent the relative performance of each individual using a normalization function to compare the various criteria."}, {"heading": "4. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY", "text": "This section describes the research method used in the experiments. We use the evaluation method proposed by Nunes et al. [23] to compare resource discovery algorithms from a search perspective. In this section, we assume that the criteria and user constraints have the same meaning and relative meaning. Furthermore, the ranking of sensors is used as input for the Pareto solutions. Sensor data, user constraints and their relative meaning are used as input for an MCDA algorithm that produces a ranking of sensors."}, {"heading": "5. RESULTS", "text": "Figure 2 represents the boxplot representation of the ONVGR, around 1000 (Figure 2.a) and 10,000 (Figure 2.b) intelligent objects that take into account two user constraints. In this figure we must suppress the outliers and limit the number of fronts to 200 to reduce the ONVGR value."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "Efficient resource discovery of intelligent objects by meeting a user's dynamic requirements is an open challenge in CoT environments. Integrating context-sensitive calculation and multi-objective optimization has been widely used to support sensor search and selection and to find the best trade-off between the available solution and the constraints imposed. In this paper, we have used a methodology presented in Nunes et al. [23] to evaluate MCDA algorithms and the impact of the relative importance of user constraints on the quality of proposed Smart Object outcomes. In addition, the accumulated results show that the use of relative importance in user constraints does not necessarily improve the quality of the solution offered by an MCDA algorithm and has a greater impact when fewer user constraints are used. Furthermore, the higher number of user constraints reduces the quality of the proposed solution due to conflicts between user constraints. For future work, we will analyze further features related to its distribution and dominance in solutions such as parameters."}, {"heading": "7. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] L. Abdullah and C. R.
