In the problem, vehicles have different sizes and characteristics and are located in multiple depots. Users can only use compatible vehicles, and must be transported from a specific location to a specific destination and eventually vice versa. The lengths of routes that are assigned to the vehicles cannot be exceeded. The quality of service requirements require the fulfillment of collection and delivery windows and a limited travel time for each user. In this paper, a comprehensive computerized study is proposed to provide different Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithms for DARNS. The algorithms are based on the general framework already used in Parragh et al. [23], for the single-depot case with homogeneous vehicles and users."}, {"heading": "2 Literature review", "text": "DARP is a generalization of the pickup-and-delivery problem with time Windows (PDPTW), although several studies have been submitted on individual hospitals. [5, 17, 28] In DARP, people instead of goods and consequently questions about the quality of the services offered and the time sequence are carefully considered (by additional limitations or by additional terms in the objective function). In recent surveys on DARP and PDPTW, we will refer the reader to Cordeau and Laporte [12] and Berbeglia et al. [4] Promising accurate techniques used in the literature for solving DARP, PDPTW and its variants are branch-and-price. [2, 5, 23] and Laporte [6, 27]. However, due to the difficulty of modeling all real-world problems and solving large dimensions, many studies have focused on the development of heuristic and metaheuristic approaches."}, {"heading": "3 Problem Description and Formulation", "text": "In DARP with multiple depots, heterogeneous vehicles and users, a number of requests must be handled in order to transport users from a specific origin to a specific destination through a fleet of vehicles located in geographically distributed depots. Whereas in standard DARP all vehicles have the same capacity and are located in a single depot [11], each vehicle with its own equipment and capacity is assigned to a specific depot and must start and finish its route in that depot. Users are heterogeneous in that they cannot be transported by all vehicles, but only by vehicles with the necessary equipment. The problem is to assign the transport requirements to the vehicles and to find a route for each vehicle, so that the total transport costs are minimized and the quality of service requirements are met."}, {"heading": "3.1 A MILP formulation", "text": "In this section, a three-part index formulation MILP is conceivable for the problem. MILP formulation extends to the manner in which the vehicles are used in the various depots.

In step 1, a first solution, s0, is first generated. s0 then undertakes a local search step that yields s, i.e. the first established solution. The second step of the algorithm is an iterative step. In each iteration h, a new solution, s (s) is created in the Nh (s) neighborhood by a shaking procedure. After that, a local search step is applied to s.

The first heuristics (called heuristics 1) is a constructive heuristics that is already used in [14] and works as follows: The transport requests are initially sorted according to the earliest point in time of collection, ie. In accordance with this order, the requests are assigned and inserted into the routes: First, the pick-up node is inserted and directly after the delivery node. A request can only be assigned to a route if the compatibility limitations are respected. Infringements of capacity or driving time are not taken into account in this insertion phase. The assignment of the request to the routes takes place according to a minimum distance criterion. More precisely, a request is assigned to the route, with the average between the distance from the destination of the last request on the route (if the route is still empty) the route is executed as a starting criterion."}, {"heading": "4.3 Shaking", "text": "Six different types of neighborhoods were considered: swap, move, reparating move, chain, eliminate and intra-move. Neighborhoods swap, chain, and move were introduced in [23] and [22], respectively. Reparating move was introduced in [14]. Finally, neighborhood eliminate is an adapted version of what is used in [14], and intra-move is a new neighborhood specifically designed for the problem considered in this paper. VNS algorithms detailed in Section 6 contain different subsets of the neighborhoods mentioned above. Below is a description of each neighborhood."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Swap", "text": "In the neighbourhood exchange, two sequences of requests belonging to two different routes are exchanged, the two sequences having a length not exceeding h, where h is the size of the current neighbourhood. Thus, an exchange of the size h = 2 consists of the exchange of two sequences that must not exceed two. Specifically, the two sequences are exchanged as follows: the first two routes are randomly selected, then the 16 lengths of the sequences in the two routes to be exchanged are randomly selected (these lengths may not exceed the size of the neighbourhood h.) Then, the first nodes of the two sequences are randomly selected. Due to the compatibility and preference limitations, all requests of the first (second) sequence must be compatible with the vehicle of the second (first) route. Otherwise, the whole process starts again. After selecting the routes and sequences, the requests of each sequence are removed from their original route and inserted in the best possible position of the second (first) route."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Move", "text": "When moving to the neighborhood, a series of transportation requests are randomly selected and inserted into randomly selected routes, taking into account compatibility and preference limitations. The number of transportation requests to move is randomly determined between 1 and the size of the current neighborhood, i.e. the insertion of the requests is the same as when swapping. Therefore, a move of size h = 3 consists of inserting a maximum of three transportation requests each on a different, randomly selected route."}, {"heading": "4.3.3 Repairing move", "text": "Moving repair is essentially a move, but it concerns only impracticable solutions. When repairing the move, transport requests are randomly selected from unfeasible routes and, as with moving, inserted into randomly selected routes. The maximum number of transport requests for moving is randomly selected between 1 and the size of the current neighbourhood, i.e. the insertion of requirements 17 into randomly selected routes is like moving and swap."}, {"heading": "4.3.4 Chain", "text": "In the chain, a sequence of requests is first randomly selected, as in the swap of an original route, say r0. Then, as in the swap, the sequence is inserted into a randomly selected destination route that is compatible with the requirements of the original order.The above procedure is repeated on the destination route (which becomes the new starting route).The procedure repeats no more than h times, with h being the neighborhood size. Thus, a chain of size h = 3 consists of moving a random order of length of no more than three from its original route to a destination route. Then, from this destination route, another sequence of no more than three lengths is shifted to a different destination route. Finally, a sequence of no more than three lengths is shifted from this third route to a fourth route."}, {"heading": "4.3.5 Eliminate", "text": "Eliminate creates new solutions by eliminating an existing route. It eliminates the route with the largest ratio between the total cost of the route and the number of requests on the route.

In the following, the local search methods are described."}, {"heading": "4.5.1 Local Search 1", "text": "Local search 1 is a procedure in which only route changes are made. The local search procedure is very similar to the one proposed in [23], but makes a smaller number of changes and is mathematically less costly, as explained below. If the route is changed by the shaking procedure, the nodes corresponding to each transport request are iteratively removed and inserted at new positions on the route if the evaluation function is improved. Specifically, in a route, the first pick-up node and its delivery node are removed from the route. Then, if the request is an incoming request, the pick-up node, or the delivery node, if it is an outgoing request, is inserted at the best possible position according to the time window restrictions. (Note that while in the procedure proposed in [23] one such node can be moved further during the search process, until the next node is no longer found at the next position, before the remaining node is assigned to the next function.)"}, {"heading": "4.5.2 Local Search 2", "text": "As with Local Search 1, this procedure removes the first pick-up node and its delivery node from the route. Subsequently, the pick-up node, if it is an incoming request, or the delivery node, if it is an outgoing request, is inserted at the best possible position according to the time frame restrictions. Subsequently, the remaining node is inserted at all possible positions directly after (if it is a pick-up node) or before (if it is a delivery node) the first assigned node. The remaining node is assigned to the position that minimizes the evaluation function. Then, the procedure proceeds with the next request on the route. The procedure ends when all routes in the solution perform this local search. Note that Local Search 2 can be more expensive computationally than Local Search 1, sincere attempts to assign the remaining node of any request at all possible positions."}, {"heading": "4.5.3 Local Search 3", "text": "Local Search 3 is very similar to Local Search 2, but performs a smaller number of moves. In fact, as with Local Search 2, the critical node is inserted at the best possible position according to the time window constraints, and then it tries to assign the remaining node to all possible positions that do not violate the time window constraints. All insertions are done as with Local Search 1, inserting first the critical node and then the remaining node."}, {"heading": "4.5.4 Focus Local Search", "text": "Focus Local Search works with the sequence of transport requests belonging to the same route, starting and ending with an empty load. In the procedure, first the routes containing such a 21a sequence are identified, then the sequences are removed from the corresponding routes and the requests involved in the sequences are inserted back into the same routes after the same insertion process as used for swap or chain."}, {"heading": "4.5.5 Focus Local Search with 8-step", "text": "This local search method works essentially like the focus local search, but immediately after inserting a request, the 8-step evaluation scheme (see Section 4.4) is applied to the (partially) current solution to minimize the total duration of the route. Thus, this method is mathematically more expensive than the focus local search. However, the overall increase in the calculation is limited, as only sequences of transport requests starting and ending with an empty load are included in the process."}, {"heading": "4.6 Adjusting Procedure", "text": "This procedure was first introduced in [14] and is effective in cases where the n / m ratio is low (i.e. when the number of vehicles is large in relation to the number of transport requests).The procedure includes established solutions s found during the shaking process that violate only the type of restriction, i.e. capacity, travel time or time windows, and in which the exceedance is below a certain threshold. The adjustment procedure selects one by one, calls for the violation of the restriction and assigns it either (i) at the beginning or end of other compatible routes already in use or (ii), if at all, to compatible routes. The mapping is done to the route that minimizes the evaluation function. The possibly feasible solution achieved by the adjustment procedure is then compared to the solution obtained so far best practicable by the algorithm."}, {"heading": "5 Benchmark instances", "text": "The first group of patients who are able to help themselves is the group of people who are able to help themselves; the second group is the group of people who are able to help themselves; the third group is the group of people who are able to help themselves; the third group is the group of people who are able to help themselves; the third group is the group of people who are able to help themselves; and the third group is the group of people who are able to help themselves."}, {"heading": "6 Computational results", "text": "Two test phases were carried out: In the first phase, a preliminary calculation campaign was conducted in which twelve VNS algorithms were developed and tested on the instances of the second set.
