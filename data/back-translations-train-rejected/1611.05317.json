As the future electrical power systems tend towards smarter and greener technology, the deployment of self sufficient networks, or microgrids, becomes more likely. Microgrids may operate on their own or synchronized with the main grid, thus control methods need to take into account islanding and reconnecting said networks. The ability to optimally and safely reconnect a portion of the grid is not well understood and, as of now, limited to raw synchronization between interconnection points. A support vector machine (SVM) leveraging real-time data from phasor measurement units (PMUs) is proposed to predict in real time whether the reconnection of a sub-network to the main grid would lead to stability or instability. A dynamics simulator fed with pre-acquired system parameters is used to create training data for the SVM in various operating states. The classifier was tested on a variety of cases and operating points to ensure diversity. Accuracies of approximately 90% were observed throughout most conditions when making dynamic predictions of a given network.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 04:20:08 GMT  (843kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05317v1", "8 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 23:29:02 GMT  (793kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05317v2", "10 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["carter lassetter", "eduardo cotilla-sanchez", "jinsub kim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05317"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.05317.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["lassettc@oregonstate.edu", "ecs@oregonstate.edu", "kimjinsu@oregonstate.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is so that most people are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want.

PROBLEM FORMULATION AND PRELIMINARIES", "text": "In this section, we formulate the stability prediction of the microgrid reconnection as a machine learning problem and provide the preliminaries that describe the SVM classification. While we describe the problem formulation in the context of SVM, the proposed framework is applicable to generic machine learning approaches. We propose to predict a stable reconnection time of a microgrid based on real-time PMU measurements. Conceptually, the SVMs transform an input feature vector into a higher-dimensional space and apply a linear classification rule to predict its class designation [24]. In our context, real-time measurements from PMUs at a given time form an input feature vector. The input vector is associated with a binary class label, either 1 or \u2212 1, depending on whether the reconnection of the microgrid in the current time would result in a stable operating point or an unknown probability distribution."}, {"heading": "III. TRAINING THE SVM USING A DYNAMIC SIMULATOR", "text": "In this section, we present the machine learning framework for predicting stable reconnection times of a micro-network, as well as the detailed procedure for training the classifier with a dynamic power supply simulator. As previously proposed, we train the SVM to predict the stability of reconnection of a micro-network when certain PMU measurements are observed. To train the SVM, we must first acquire a series of training examples, each of which is an input vector (i.e. a vector of PMU measurements) and the true class label (i.e. the stability of the reconnection when the input vector is observed as PMU measurements). Unfortunately, it is difficult in practice to obtain sufficient training data from realistically large power supply systems, as obtaining a pair requires disconnecting and reconnecting the micro-network. Therefore, we resort to a dynamic power supply to generate training data simultaneously by running a variety of scenarios for the target system."}, {"heading": "A. Overview", "text": "Fig. 2 illustrates the approach we are following for the experiments in this work. We begin this process by dividing a test case into different operating points. Each of these operating points is used to create different starting conditions that are unique for each operating point. These new starting conditions are created by randomly scaling the load across the network. We run dynamic simulations that consist of landing and reconnecting the microgrid to create our synthesized PMU measurements and determine the stability of said reconnection. After collecting the data, we break down our data into training and test sets that are used to train the classifier. We then use the classifier to monitor the PMU currents and predict the potential stability of reconnecting the microgrid. We chose the 73-bus version of the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS-96) [25] and the 2383-bus version of the Poland Test Case 4 as the approach that will be well tested in our assessment of the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS-96)."}, {"heading": "B. Diversifying Operating Points", "text": "It is important to consider test cases that can reproduce different operating points, for example, depending on the time of day, day of the week or season [27]. In this way, we created different operating points by randomly shifting and scaling loads throughout the system. After obtaining the new demand distribution, we assumed a stationary solution to the case and considered it stable and usable if the voltage size specification was between 0.9 p.u. and 1.1 p.u. for the RTS-96 case or 0.8 p.u. and 1.1 p.u. for the case of Poland. For each operating point, we created different starting conditions by changing the active and reactive load on each bus according to equations (8) and (9): Pnew = Pold + destination Pold, TA (\u2212 a, b) (8) Qnew = Qold, GP (\u2212 a, b) (9), where Pold = Pold + determination system the new and Pold-original action system are both the same and the new performance system."}, {"heading": "C. Dynamic Simulation", "text": "We are interested in the interaction between the subgrid and the main grid after connection is restored. In order to observe the most important restoration mechanisms, we simulate the dynamics of the current system using a time domain simulator software (Siemens PTI PSS / e) together with a tailor-made command line interface (Python API1). We initially used a research quality dynamic simulator alongside PSS / e for cross-validation and tuning of dynamic machine models [28], [29]. The selected dynamic models consist of outstanding generator machines, IEEE Type 1 excitors and IEEE Type 2 governors. we initiate each simulation run in PSS / e with a flat start test to ensure that the dynamic models do not alter the stationary state solution, and also that no protectors are in operation during the stationary state. We added relay models and protectors to our test cases, including subcurrent dynamics, where we will connect the subcurrent and subcurrent for use."}, {"heading": "D. Data Generation and Labeling", "text": "The proposed learning scheme requires the collection of training examples used to train an SVM classifier. We use the above-mentioned dynamic simulation module and different starting conditions to create different training examples. As previously mentioned, we create different operating points for our test cases and then create new starting conditions for each operating point for diversity. Each initial condition case gives us a single characteristic vector together with a single 1Application Program Interface5 label. The characteristic vector for each case consists of the bus voltages and angles measured by PMUs at the time before the reconnection. Angles were rolled out to the first rotation, between -180 and 180 degrees. We assume that the PMU set is fixed for clarity reasons. The label for each initial condition case represents whether the case became stable or unstable after the subnet was reconnected to the main network."}, {"heading": "E. Test Scenarios", "text": "We divide the complete data set into two subsets; one representing the training set to create the classifier, and the other to test the accuracy of the classifier. Three main methods of creating the training and test set have been used and described below. 1) Single Operating Point Case: We will begin the classifier's different starting conditions with the simplest case, assuming that our classifier will be used independently of other operating points. This test demonstrates the classifier's ability to make predictions with a single operating point. 2) Multiple Operating Points Case: To build on the previous test, we will use multiple operating points to form training points. 2) Multiple Operating Points Case: To build on the previous test, we will use multiple operating points to make predictions with PMU data streams coming from a known network operating point."}, {"heading": "F. Classifier", "text": "In view of the training and test sets that have been prepared, the next step is to define and build the classifier. As already mentioned, it may be necessary to switch the features to another dimension where classification is easier, which leads us to choose from different cores and hyperparameters. SVM is very sensitive to the selected kernel and hyperparameters, so it is important to set up the classifier to maximize our predictive accuracy. To find the optimal kernel and hyperparameter, we use k-fold cross validation on the training set [30]. Random oversampling analyses are applied to balance the training set so that the classifier is not too closely aligned with the majority class [31]. The next step is to train the classifier with the entire set of training data available. Upon completion of the training, the classifier is able to predict classes over the invisible input of the machine, especially if the SVM is trained on the invisible feature 32."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "In this section, we present the performance of the proposed method for predicting the stability of the micro-grid restoration. To evaluate, we first used the RTS-96 test case to demonstrate the approach, and the Poland case to compare the methodology with a real energy system [33]. As already mentioned, the proposed classifier can take into account several PCCs in a network. Thus, for example, due to the choice of Iceland zone 3 in RTS-96, we consider the two PCCs shown in Figure 3."}, {"heading": "A.

CONCLUSION", "text": "The proposed approach uses a Power System Dynamics Simulator to generate synthetic but size-realistic training examples that can then be used to train a classifier. Interactions between Power System Dynamics and protective mechanisms are complex, and accurately deriving an optimal control strategy is not always practicable. However, as shown in this paper, a machine learning approach can be useful to capture many unintuitive behaviors and make real-time predictions based on PMU measurements. Future improvements to the training aspect may be necessary as the process for constructing this classifier is relatively mature and requires deep knowledge, and cannot be directly applicable to operators due to the understanding necessary to build a well-trained classifier. The classifier has been tested on a variety of cases and operating points to ensure diversity. Accuracy of approximately 90% of the network was observed in the preparation of a given dynamic predictor."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This material is based on work supported by the Ministry of Energy under the premium number de-oe0000780."}], "references": [{"title": "How a smarter grid could have prevented the 2003 U.S. cascading blackout", "author": ["J.

reconnection of sub-networks to a main grid. As the future electrical power systems tend towards smarter and greener technology, the deployment of self sufficient networks, or microgrids, becomes more likely. Microgrids may operate on their own or synchronized with the main grid, thus control methods need to take into account islanding and reconnecting of said networks. The ability to optimally and safely reconnect a portion of the grid is not well understood and, as of now, limited to raw synchronization between interconnection points. A support vector machine (SVM) leveraging real-time data from phasor measurement units (PMUs) is proposed to predict in real time whether the reconnection of a sub-network to the main grid would lead to stability or instability. A dynamics simulator fed with pre-acquired system parameters is used to create training data for the SVM in various operating states. The classifier was tested on a variety of cases and operating points to ensure diversity. Accuracies of approximately 85% were observed throughout most conditions when making dynamic predictions of a given network.
