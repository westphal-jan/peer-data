Identifying writing styles and the authors of anonymous or misattributed texts has been of interest to scholars at least since the invention of the printing press, when the availability and access to texts promoted comparative studies. Although, in fact, text assignment techniques fall into two distinct categories that concern the nature of the evidence used. Internal analysis is concerned with the way in which language is applied, from syntactic events to the use of expressions characteristic of a particular author, or originate from text critics based on Lachmannian text criticism. The purpose of internal analysis is to find the author's finger principles, and in the process assumes that each author maintains a modus scribendi - as Madrigal called it - which is characteristic for each author to reflect on the other side of the author's analysis as reflected in the circumstances."}, {"heading": "Materials", "text": "A major problem with the calculation methods is that they usually require the availability of digital editions of the texts, and it has been proven that some of the methods work better when their extensions are at the level of the entire books. These types of collections exist, but they usually do not grant access to the entire text; 43 therefore, we have decided to record our candidates over a period of 90 years around the publication of the first known edition of Lazarillo. 43. - CORDE, for example, only allows counting frequencies. Our study, we were forced to collect our own corpus in order to record work over a period of 90 years around the publication of the first known edition of Lazarillo. All major modified candidates for the authorship of the small book are included as well as some authors who had not previously been considered. The inclusion of these other authors is not accidental: they add the robustness of our method and establish a framework to assess its effectiveness."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they have set themselves in order to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "Comprehension and Compression", "text": "When confronted with many characteristics, dimensionality reduction and selection techniques can be applied to the individual words (Forman), even if they are not able to capture the styles of the authors and thus also lead to genre or theme-dependent characteristics (Brank et al.). John Burrows, after experimenting with techniques based on multivariate analyses to reduce the dimensionality of the attribute space, has come up with an approach that fits perfectly into Juola's broad definition of an author attribution method: the \"Delta\" method (Burrows, \"Delta\" 267-287; Attribution and Beyond \"). From a frequency distribution of the 150 most common words in a corpus, the method begins by estimating the mean frequency of the word and its variance. Burrows\" Delta \"(which he insists on naming it where it is possible, although his assertions are then heard as\" differences between thematic \")."}, {"heading": "Decomposing the Lazarillo", "text": "There is enough evidence that more or less intuitive functions cause more or less many people to be able to understand words and expressions and to understand what they are doing.

However, we add that the candidacy for Arce de Ot\u00e1lora was strongly supported. Deficiencies are generally due to the corpus rather than the methodology. Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, on the other hand, is one of the most documented candidates of all, and possibly the one we trust who has not proved to be a strong player in our analysis."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This study began with an overview of the status of the question of authorship of the Lazarillo mask, which enabled us to establish a base corpus of candidates with whom to work. Subsequent exploratory analysis, using distance-based metrics and methods from unattended learning, gave the first clues. Juan Arce de Ot\u00e1lora and Alfonso de Vald\u00e9s were then highlighted and soon supported by the use of more sophisticated methods.The majority of the statistical evidence seems to point towards Arce de Ot\u00e1lora with greater distance in relation to Vald\u00e9s, and while our corpus is not as comprehensive as that used by Madrigal, the legal scholar is still selected by the learning methods as the most likely author. It seems as if all statistical techniques agree with Arce de Ot\u00e1lora authors who support the Madrigal hypothesis, but it may not be the ultimate proof that the author needs authority."}, {"heading": "Further Research", "text": "Much remains to be done in terms of computer-aided approaches to resolving the anonymity of Lazarillo. In addition, forensic linguistics also includes issues related to the author plagiarism and author clustering, which could help, for example, to identify the legitimacy of interpolaciones as part of Lazarillo's text, or to identify whether differences intervened in the creation of the small book. However, debates in this context can also be enriched by the use of modern techniques such as that of social network analysis. Previous studies in various areas have proved useful in order to shed some light on the discussion of similar issues and contribute to investigating the graph structure of the actors involved (Su\u00e1rez, Sancho, and de la Rosa)."}, {"heading": "Supplementary Materials", "text": "Although the diagrams represent the two main components of the frequency distribution, only 600 random chunks out of 300 words of Sebastian- Juan Diego Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 - Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 - Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Sebastian- Sebastian- Sebastian- Sebastian- Sebastian- Sebastian- Sebastian- Sebastian- Sebastian- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebaan- Sebaan- Sebaan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Sebastian- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebastian- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebaz\u00f3n - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebaz\u00f3n - Sebaz\u00f3n - Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Seba\u00edan- Jos\u00e9 - Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Jos\u00e9 - Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Seba\u00edan- Jos\u00e9 - Seba\u00edan- Seba\u00edan- Jos\u00e9 - Seba\u00edan- Sebaz- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Sebazan- Sebazan- Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9"}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Summit work of the Spanish Golden Age and forefather of the so-called picaresque novel, The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of His Fortunes and Adversities still remains an anonymous text.
