Honda's Asimo humanoid robot, iRobot's Roomba robot vacuum cleaner and Google's driverless cars have fired the imagination of the general public, and social media buzz with speculation about a utopian world of helpful robot assistants or the coming robot apocalypse! However, there is a long way to go before autonomous systems reach the level of capabilities required for even the simplest of tasks involving human-robot interaction - especially if it involves communicative behaviour such as speech and language. Of course the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made great strides in these areas, and has moved on from abstract high-level rule-based paradigms to embodied architectures whose operations are grounded in real physical environments. What is still missing, however, is an overarching theory of intelligent communicative behaviour that informs system-level design decisions in order to provide a more coherent approach to system integration. This chapter introduces the beginnings of such a framework inspired by the principles of Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). In particular, it is observed that PCT has hitherto tended to view perceptual processes as a relatively straightforward series of transformations from sensation to perception, and has overlooked the potential of powerful generative model-based solutions that have emerged in practical fields such as visual or auditory scene analysis. Starting from first principles, a sequence of arguments is presented which not only shows how these ideas might be integrated into PCT, but which also extend PCT towards a remarkably symmetric architecture for a needs-driven communicative agent. It is concluded that, if behaviour is the control of perception, then perception is the simulation of behaviour.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 17:32:10 GMT  (767kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05379v1", "To appear in A.

Finance agencies and large companies have invested heavily in autonomous systems - especially robotics - on the premise that significant economic benefits can be derived from the automation of the Industrial Revolution."}, {"heading": "1.1 Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence", "text": "The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) was coined in 1955 and, in its early years, was mainly concerned with mathematical logic and automatic theoretical proofs (assuming that \"intelligence\" was based on processes of rational thinking). [10] Activities such as chess were seen as the epitome of human intellectual performance and were therefore at the center of early research. However, it soon became clear that the physical manipulation of actual chess pieces could be more difficult than the game itself. AI therefore played an important role in expanding our understanding of how living systems in general, and humans in particular, physically interact with the world, through developments in areas such as biologically inspired robotics and autonomous systems. Until the mid-1980s, the most important paradigm for AI-based robotics was the so-called \"advisory\" architecture, in which symbolic representations of the world were manipulated in a hierarchical rules-based framework with goals and objectives."}, {"heading": "1.2 Behaviour-Based Robotics", "text": "In the 1980s, the increasing difficulties in trying to use GOFAI in real-world robots led to a new \"reactive\" (as opposed to \"advisory\") approach based on simple, representation-free processes. Rodney Brooks welcomed the introduction of what should be known as \"new artificial intelligence,\" but introduced a novel \"subsumption\" architecture, in which the emphasis was on real-time behavior using simple calculations embedded in a layer structure [13] (see Fig. 2). The basic idea was that the different layers should operate more or less independently (and in parallel), with the higher levels based on the successful operation of the lower levels. If necessary, the higher levels could change (i.e. \"subsume\") the behavior of the lower levels. Overall, the emphasis was on grounding behavior in the real world (and in parallel), with the hypothesis that complex interactions should emerge as the emerging property of a simple series of processes (as suggested by Braitenberg)."}, {"heading": "1.3 Artificial Cognitive Systems", "text": "Recent work in robotics has taken a more pragmatic view, mixing and matching GOFAI's best ideas and behavior-based robotics with some of the new perspectives in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Known as \"artificial cognitive systems\" [17,18], the most significant influence is the emphasis on behavior, embodiment, and the situation in which the relationship between a goal-oriented robot and its physical context is crucial to the real world [19,20]. Low-level interactions are managed locally and at a high level, \"given meaning,\" not by handmade rules, but by their anchoring in real interactions. Interaction is facilitated by the \"affordances\" [21,22] provided by the robot environment. A particular example of a contemporary architecture for an artificial cognitive world in which humans communicate with each other (DAC)."}, {"heading": "1.4 Agent Based Modelling", "text": "One aspect of behavior that often occurs in alternative approaches to modeling and building intelligent systems is intentionality. It is clearly the case that living systems appear to be purposeful and purposeful in their efforts [32], and this has had a major impact on AI and robotics. In particular, one area where intentionality plays a key role is the area of agent-based modeling (ABM) [33,34]. ABM is an established methodology for simulating the actions and interactions of multiple agents: for example, predicting crowd behavior, optimizing a supply chain, or managing labor. Various modeling paradigms are used, such as cellular automata [35] or special multi-agent programming environments [36]. However, for \"intelligent\" agents, ABM simulations are often constructed using a Beliefs Desires Intention (BDI) architecture [35] or special multi-agent programming environments [36]."}, {"heading": "1.5 Contemporary Intelligent Systems", "text": "In the last ten years, the number of those who are able to double has multiplied."}, {"heading": "2 Whither Perceptual Control Theory?", "text": "Although it is more than 40 years since Bill Powers's groundbreaking book \"Behavior: The Control of Perception\" (B: CP) was published [65], the theory of perception control could still have something important to say about computer models of \"intelligent\" communicative behavior. Over the years, the PCT's main impetus has been to challenge the traditional behavioral stimulus that still prevails in some areas of the psychological field [66, 67]. PCT aims to provide a more partisan model that emphasizes the crucial importance of recognizing internal preferential states (so-called \"reference variables\") that are ordered in a control hierarchy, along with the power of negative feedback to achieve and maintain these preferential states in the face of unforeseeable disturbances. Crucially, PCT focuses attention on controlling perceptual inputs, not on behavioral parameters, but rather on the parameters of the human control mechanism."}, {"heading": "2.1 Classic Automatic Control", "text": "Reminder: PCT was developed within the framework of existing knowledge of the classical theory of automatic control - the investigation of systems that are able to self-regulate, usually by the mechanism of negative feedback [69]. A classical single-input single-output closed feedback control system from automatic control theory is illustrated in Fig. 6. The plant (or controlled system) g2 is the process controlled by the feedback control system, and the behavior of the plant can be subjected to arbitrary interference d. The feedback elements g1 generate control signals u, which are applied to the plant that produces the controlled power c. The reference input r specifies the desired performance of the plant. The feedback elements map the controlled power c to the feedback signal b, and this is compared with the external reference signal r, and the resulting error signal generates a control effect via g1. With the feedback elements, the controlled power c to the feedback signal b, this is compared with the external reference signal r, and the resulting error signal should be annotated via functions suitable for each g1 and g2."}, {"heading": "2.2 Hierarchical Perceptual Control", "text": "In fact, it is not that it is a real problem, but rather a problem that occurs at every level. (HPCT) The main difference is that the PCT structure is illustrated by a classical automatic control. (HPCT) The main difference is that the PCT structure is able to model the behavior of a living system, and this means that the reference variable is intrinsic (instead of extrinsic). In all other areas, the two control structures are identical. (HPCT)"}, {"heading": "2.3 The Way Forward?", "text": "In fact, some attempts have been made in this area to exercise control in artificial systems such as robots (76,77,78), but since a large proportion of robot engineers who take negative feedback systems for granted, they have not seen the particular advantages of using (H) PCTs. On the other hand, PCT has begun to have an impact in the field of spoken language processing (79), and it was found many years ago that human speech is optimized for the listener."}, {"heading": "3 Towards \u2018Intelligent\u2019 Communicative Systems", "text": "The revealing catchphrase for (H) PCT is, therefore, \"Behavior is the control of perception\" - but what is perception and how are controlled variables estimated? InB: CP [65], Powers himself does not say much about perceptual mechanisms; he acknowledges the potentially arbitrary relationship that exists between internal perceptions and external reality, but seems to assume a form of direct (neural) transformation / mapping of first-order intensities to higher-order invariant perceptions carried out by an \"input function\" (albeit mediated by memory - see Section 2.2). Of course, such an assumption is common in pattern recognition / machine learning literature, but in practical areas such as visual or auditory scene analysis (and even in the latest theories of brain function [87]), the notion of \"perception as transformation\" is supplemented by the emergence of stronger (and more successful) model-based solutions."}, {"heading": "3.1 Actions and Consequences", "text": "Consider a world that obeys the ordinary laws of physics. World W has a number of possible states S, and its state s [t] at present t is a function of its state s [t \u2212 1] at present t \u2212 1. The world can therefore be regarded as a form of the dynamic system (probably non-linear, almost certainly stochastical) that develops over time from one state to another. These state transitions can be expressed as a transformation............ The events follow a course of time in which it can be said that actions (i.e. the sequence of events in the past) lead to consequences (i.e. the sequence of events in the past) that represent further actions that lead to further consequences, and events follow a course of time in which it can be said that actions (i.e. the sequence of events in the past) lead to consequences (i.e. the sequence of events in the future) that represent further actions that lead to further consequences, and are so minimal that everything can be represented on the basis of relative (W)."}, {"heading": "3.2 An Agent Manipulating the World", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "3.3 An Agent Interpreting the World", "text": "In this case, it is possible that the aforementioned persons are able to take the aforementioned measures in order to put them in the position in which they are.

So, starting again from the first principles - for the transmitting agent sActionss = gs (Intentionss), (10) where gs is the transformation of intentions into behavior (i.e., for the receiving agent rInterpretationsr = hr (Actionss), could be an interpretation value (Intentionss = gs (Intentionss), in which the synthesis of intentions is transformed into behavior), and for the receiving agent could be an interpretation value."}, {"heading": "3.5 An Agent Interpreting the Behaviour of Another Agent", "text": "The arguments put forward in Section 3.3 support the attempt to interpret the intentions of agents. (13) This is a negative feedback control loop that conducts a search of the possible intentions of agents and their realizations by agents. (13) This process can be regarded as analysis-by-synthesis. (13) This configuration is exactly how contemporary approaches to automatic speech recognition are formulated (with a probabilistic, forward generative model known as the \"Hidden Markov Model.\" (HMM) In fact, the analysis-by-synthesis approach to speech recognition is not just a reminiscence of the motor theory of speech perception."}, {"heading": "3.7 A Needs-Driven Communicative Agent", "text": "The preceding arguments have provided interesting answers to two key questions: (i) How can an agent optimize his behavior in order to communicate? (19) This situation is particularly relevant to the high degree of similarity found in living systems between species (members of the same species). (20) The idea of recruiting information about oneself in order to model others is a core component of the PRESENCE architecture (Section 2.3), which in turn is based on the principle of mirror structures in the brain (Section 1.3).

However, intentionality has previously been considered a key factor in communicative interaction."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to assert themselves, that they are able to assert themselves, that they are able to assert themselves, and that they are able to assert themselves, and that they are able to assert themselves."}, {"heading": "5 Summary and Conclusion", "text": "It is as if people are able to determine for themselves what they want.

However, there is a long way to go before autonomous systems reach the level of capabilities required for even the simplest of tasks involving human-robot interaction especially if it involves communicative behaviour such as speech and language. Of course the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made great strides in these areas, and has moved on from abstract high-level rule-based paradigms to embodied architectures whose operations are grounded in real physical environments. What is still missing, however, is an overarching theory of intelligent communicative behaviour that informs system-level design decisions in order to provide a more coherent approach to system integration. This chapter introduces the beginnings of such a framework inspired by the principles of Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). In particular, it is observed that PCT has hitherto tended to view perceptual processes as a relatively straightforward series of transformations from sensation to perception, and has overlooked the potential of powerful generative model-based solutions that have emerged in practical fields such as visual or auditory scene analysis. Starting from first principles, a sequence of arguments is presented which not only shows how these ideas might be integrated into PCT, but which also extend PCT towards a remarkably symmetric architecture for a needs-driven communicative agent. It is concluded that, if behaviour is the control of perception (the central tenet of PCT), then perception (at least for communicative agents) is the simulation of behaviour.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
