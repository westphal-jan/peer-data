This is also a valid point of view for our packing programs: the answer sets we get correspond to the solutions of a packing problem. As a consequence, if a problem contains multiple answer sets, we will also deal with multiple answer sets, and in fact, all programs in Examples 1-3 have multiple answer sets. Our proposal to deal with multiple answer sets is to have the aMCS machine compute in the first place. The underlying assumption is that each set of answers is equally well suited, as all of them are considered to be a solution. Therefore, a situation in which a program has response sets that are considered to be inferior. DS requires that only desired answer sets remain. ASP offers many excellent features for specifying preferences and finding optimal solutions (see [1,3,7]."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "While the method presented in this paper was developed for use in the aMCS framework, it addresses a general problem that will often arise when dealing with stream data: deciding when and which part of buffered input data should be processed, or which information should be ignored. Our goal in this paper was to use a series of examples to show that declarative specifications using ASP can be of great help here. ASP's rich language allows for concise expression of how data should be bundled into packages that meet the input requirements for further processing, which can be considered a combined classification and configuration task. Using ASP for configuration purposes has a long tradition [22,13]. We use ASP for pre-processing and structuring stream data, which can itself be considered an example of stream reasoning using ASP."}], "references": [{"title": "Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, and Declarative Problem Solving", "author": ["C.
