In other words, the goal in all three methods is the same - to maximize the probability that a target that happens to move on one of the edges of the network will be detected. Of course, the most trivial method for using n monitoring units is the random deployment method. In other words, the positioning of units in randomly selected nodes in the network. As we will soon see, this method achieves surprisingly good performance in some cases. However, this method can be improved by taking into account certain characteristics of the network, resulting in improved performance in many cases.In the coming sections, we will see several such improvements, all of which are based on the traffic-based improvement of the standard method, the results of this precarious method are then presented."}, {"heading": "7.1 Betweenness Centrality vs. Traffic Flow", "text": "Betweenness Centrality (BC) stands for the ability of a single node to control the flow of communication in the networks and is defined as the total fraction of the shortest distances between each pair of nodes passing through a particular vertex [20, 44]. In recent years, Betweenness has been extensively used to analyze various complex BC networks [23,81], including social networks [77,87], computer communication networks [42, 93] and protein interaction networks [28]. Holme [51] have shown that Betweenness is highly correlated to congestion particle hopping systems. Extensions to the original definition of BC are applicable to directed and weighted networks [29, 89] as well as to multi-layered networks in which the underlying infrastructure and the origin destination-destination overlay are explicitly defined [70].

We note that both BC calculation methods (equations 13 and 14 above) assume that routes will be chosen according to the shortest route strategy based on the hop count. In this section, we retain the shortest route assumptions, but use weighted links to calculate the traffic level. One option is to use the length of the road segments as their weighting characteristics for the shortest route calculations. Recent route tweets (such as Dijkstras or Bellman-Fords) tweets are able to include only a distance weighting on links when calculating the weight of the road segment. Therefore, we assume that the primary tweeted tweets tweeted by heuristic leaders will have to choose a route to reach their destination and recompute the tweets tweeted tweets tweeted by the BC on the diverted transport that the weight of their route is calculated by their travel time."}, {"heading": "7.4 Optimizing the Locations of Surveillance and Monitoring Stations", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "8 Transportation Network Dataset", "text": "In this section, we evaluate our proposed model using a real transport data set that includes data on the structure of Israeli roads and traffic through them (simulating the potential targets to be detected or monitored).This section presents the data set and its various aspects, and discusses in detail its network characteristics - from which the optimal use of drone swarms can be derived.The widespread use of mobile phones in Israel enables accurate transport data to be collected. Given the small size of the country, all mobile phone companies offer nationwide coverage. As shown in [25], penetration of mobile phones in the Israeli market is very high, even for low-income households, and especially for people aged 10 to 70 (the main focus of travel behavior studies).Such penetration allows for a comprehensive study of travel behavior based on the mobility patterns of randomly selected mobile phones in the Israeli transport system."}, {"heading": "8.1 Network Structure", "text": "Based on the data set described above, we have created a network structure that assigns continuous indices from 1 to 6716 to the nodes (nodes). To get a basic understanding of the network, we first extracted and examined several of its structural properties (see Table 1): We have divided the network into structural equivalence classes of nodes and bi-connected components, and calculated the betweenness centrality indices of the nodes (betweenness centrality is an important network feature that measures the proportion of the shortest paths between all node pairs in the network leading through a particular node. See more details in [44, 60, 62]): Structurally equivalent centrality indices of the nodes have exactly the same neighbors, and the set of these nodes is referred to as structural equivalence class. As shown in Table 1, the number of structural equivalence classes consisting of two nodes, where the number of nodes in the network is approximately equal to the number of nodes in the other nodes, is not equal to the number of nodes in the network."}, {"heading": "8.2 Congestions", "text": "In this paper, we define the effects of congestion as the difference between the time it takes to travel through an overloaded connection and the time it takes for the free flow to occur. Congestion at nodes can occur either inbound or outbound. Congestion at inbound nodes is the sum of all congestions at incoming nodes. Figure 17 shows the distribution of congestion at network nodes (nodes). The current nature of this distribution means that the vast majority of nodes are not overloaded, but there are some nodes whose congestion can be arbitrary in size. Based on the user equilibrium [45] of the Wardrop, this also implies a small number of still significant deviations between routes chosen by travelers during free flow and during congestion. In Section 7.3, we use this fact to merge between two routing strategies."}, {"heading": "8.3 Flow", "text": "The data set analyzed contains traffic flows through connections provided as the number of vehicles per hour. We calculate the total incoming flow through a node by adding up the flows of all incoming connections, calculating the outgoing flow symmetrically. Unless a particular intersection is a source or destination of traffic, we expect the incoming flow to correspond to the outgoing flow. Figure 18 shows the correlation between incoming and outgoing flow. We see that the vast majority of nodes are located at the main angle level, but there are some deviations caused by the fact that the data represent average measurements taken over a considerable period of time. Figure 19 shows the distribution of incoming flow to network nodes. This distribution is exponential, meaning that the vast majority of nodes have little flow through them. However, unlike network congestion, there is no \"unlimited fluctuation,\" i.e. the flow through the \"most crowded\" nodes is not as high due to the fact that the node 6 is the longest and the law points are not as high."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we discussed the problem of optimizing the type, number and locations of surveillance drones that attempt to detect maneuvers targeting a predefined traffic network. We presented a model for analytically generating an optimal surveillance strategy, flexible enough to support different models of drones (of different costs and performance specifications), as well as an deployment scheme that measures a traffic-oriented variant of the Betweenness network. We then evaluated the model, as well as this deployment scheme, using a variety of deployment schemes, including an extremely efficient scheme that we developed that measures a traffic-oriented variant of the Betweenness network."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "<lb>Current state of the art in the field of UAV activation relies solely on human<lb>operators for the design and adaptation of the drones flying routes.
