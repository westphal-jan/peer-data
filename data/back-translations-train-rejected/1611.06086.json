Pareto dominance can be categorized into three types: strictly dominated (), weakly dominated () and indifferent (~). Let two solution vectors be a and b. Then, if the solution vector a dominates vector b in all targets, then a solution vector b dominates in some targets but not all, then a weakly dominating b (a b). Finally, if the solution vector a does not dominate vector b and the solution vector b does not dominate in all targets, then a is indifferent to b (a ~ b). Strictly pareto-conform, the point of the vector can be defined as follows: Let there be two solution sets; X and Y for a specific MO problem. If the hypervolume of the coverage X is greater than the space of the X or the Y point may be the vector."}, {"heading": "PROBLEM DESCRIPTION", "text": "This problem involves optimising the yields of certain chemical products extracted from the Gardenia Jasminoides Ellis fruit. The phenolic compounds in Gardenia Jasminoides Ellis have high antioxidant properties that make this fruit valuable for medicinal purposes (Li et al., 2008). Compared to other natural food pigments, the colouring components of the fruit of Gardenia Jasminoides Ellis are non-toxic and chemically stable (Van Calsteren et al., 1997) The components in the Gardenia fruit (Osima et al., 1988) are iridoid glycosides (for example; gardenoside, geniposide and scandoside methyl ester) which could be transformed into blue dyes under aerobic condition by enzymes or some micro-organisms."}, {"heading": "NORMAL BOUNDARY INTERSECTION METHOD", "text": "The NBI Method (Das and Dennis, 1998) is a geometrically inspired scalarization technique for solving MO optimization problems. In contrast to the Weighted Sum Method, the NBI Method seeks an almost uniform distribution of pareto-optimal solutions at the border.

Particle Swarm Optimization", "text": "The PSO algorithm was originally proposed by Kennedy and Eberhart (1995). This technique originates from two different concepts. The first idea is based on the study of swarms or flocking of behaviors among some types of organisms (such as birds, fish, etc.); the second idea is inspired by the field of evolutionary calculation; the PSO algorithms explore the search space for optimal candidate solutions and then evaluate these solutions in terms of some custom fitness requirements. Candidates are achieved as a result of warming through the fitness landscape."}, {"heading": "2.

Convergence Metric", "text": "The convergence metric (Deb & Jain, 2002) was developed to measure the degree of convergence of a solution set relative to a reference / base set. As the optimal limit of Pareto was not known, a target vector P * was used as the reference set, which is the most dominant vector.For a number of solutions, the formula for calculating the convergence metric for a single program run is as follows: Mk kj k i k Pj iffff d1 minmax * 1 min (29), where i and j denote the subsequent objective functional values, k the index denoting the objective function, fk max the maximum objective functional value, fk min the minimum objective functional value, and M the total number of objectives.

Hypervolume Indicator", "text": "One approach that has proven effective in measuring the quality of the solution set that forms the Pareto boundary in cases where the Pareto boundary is unknown is the Hypervolume Indicator (HVI) (Zitzler & Thiele, 1998).

Therefore, the Hopfield extension in the HoPSO technique improves the generation of converged solutions, which de facto increases the level of dominance of the solutions. In this thesis, the Swarm intelligence algorithms provided stable calculations during program execution. All the Pareto-efficient solutions generated by the algorithms developed in this thesis were effective, were algorithms that were more feasible, and the results of the work were not limited to the algorithms."}, {"heading": "FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS", "text": "As mentioned in Ganesan et al., (2013), understanding the structure of objective space is crucial for the development of algorithmic improvements. To this end, testing MO with a wide range of algorithms and metrics could improve our understanding of problem morphology, which would de facto provide insights into approaches to improving our algorithms to achieve global or near-global optimization. In addition, hybridization techniques (Elamvazuthi et al., 2011) could also be used and compared with algorithmic approaches, thereby identifying critical differences in performance and solution quality, and extending the approach used in this work to problems containing various uncertainties (Vasant et al., 2010; Ganesan et al., 2014)."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The authors are very grateful to the reviewers for their efforts to provide useful and constructive insights that the author overlooked in writing the manuscript.

The Coefficient of Performance (COP) and the Rate of Refrigeration (ROR) was successfully maximized in that work. Recently, MO optimization methods have also penetrated the power and energy industries. For instance, in Van Sickel et al., (2008), the MO optimization of a fossil fuel power plant was done using multi-objective evolutionary programming (MOEP) and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithms. The MO techniques in that work were done to develop reference governors for power plant control systems. Another work on the MO optimization of reference governor design for power plants was done by Heo and Lee, (2006). In that work, PSO variant algorithms were used to find the optimal mapping between unit load demands and pressure set point of a fossil fuel power plant. By this approach, the optimal set points of the controllers under a large variety of operation scenarios were achieved. Similarly, in the works of Song and Kusiak (2010), temporal processes in power plants were optimized using MO techniques. In that work, the central theme was to maximize the boiler efficiency while minimizing the limestone consumption. Two approaches; the Data Mining (DM) and evolutionary strategy algorithms were combined to solve the optimization model. In Song and Kusiak, (2010) the MO optimization of temporal dependent processes were successfully completed by identifying the optimum control parameters. One other area at which MO optimization has been applied with considerable success is in the field of economic/environmental dispatch for power systems.

In the area of thermal system design, the MO optimization of an HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, AirConditioning and Cooling) system was carried out by Kusiak et al., (2010). In that work, a neural network was used to derive the MO optimization model. This model was then optimized using a multi-objective PSO algorithm (MOPSO). Using this algorithm, the authors identified the optimum control settings for the supply air temperature and static pressure to minimize the air handling unit energy consumption while maintaining air quality. On the other hand, in materials engineering, the MO optimization of the surface grinding process was carried out by Pai et al., (2011). In that work, the enhanced version of the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) was employed to optimize the machining parameters of the grinding process to increase the utility for machining economics and to increase the product quality (Azouzi & Guillot, 1998). Another application of the NSGA-II algorithm to engineering system design was done in Nain et al., (2010). In Nain et al., (2010), the authors optimized the structural parameters (area and length of the TEC elements) of the Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC).
