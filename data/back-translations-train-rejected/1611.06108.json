It is expected that the calculations involved will produce routes with certain soft guarantees about them, such as the fastest possible routes or sometimes avoiding traffic jams. There are also more important strict guarantees, especially that a route is physically and legally passable. To provide these strict guarantees, the system must be equipped with up-to-date representations of the road network and all related rules, such as one-way streets and turn-off restrictions. Some of these rules, such as speed limits, are also useful for providing soft warranties. To date, the elaboration of these advanced network maps with semi-automatic techniques has been carried out. Modern automatic systems exist for mapping of passable roads (Cao & Krumm 2009) and also for inventory of traffic signs."}, {"heading": "2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION", "text": "There are two types of prepared information that we separate: a set of recorded and classified characters that is combined with a navigable road network 101. We store some useful information about the characters: their positions, their types and their orientations relative to the north, also called azimuths. These are all data we need to define our problem, with our main goal being to automatically produce an enriched version of this network with traffic rules that are extracted from this information so that it can be used to make better routing algorithms. As a desirable side effect, our rules can be published in accordance with a standard, such as the INSPIRE Data Specification on Transport Network \u2020."}, {"heading": "3 THE NAVIGATIONAL RULE DERIVATION ALGORITHM", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Overview", "text": "The idea behind the NRD is to mimic the natural behavior of human drivers as they drive through a relatively unknown road network, such as a city. Drivers need to take note of the signs as they navigate the network, so they can figure out where to navigate from their current vehicle position and effectively map rules for roads within visions. We can safely assume that the rules of any signs that restrict navigation can be assigned when a crossing is reached after navigation. While no crossing is reached, there is no decision to make as sudden U-turns are normally prohibited, but as mentioned in Section 2, there are signs that include navigation restrictions and are placed in front of the crossing, at any point along the road, so it is important to recognize and remember these signs until a crossing is reached, as a human driver would do."}, {"heading": "3.2 Sign detection", "text": "The detector described in Figure 3 returns visible signs from an intersection. First, it receives all signs that are at a distance of 15m, and then discards those that are not aligned with the intersection. In order to achieve a reasonable time efficiency, we implement the filtering process using a spatial index such as an R-tree (Guttman 1984). Another operation involved in this detector is the calculation of headers that return the bearing of point B from 3. Theoretically, it makes no sense to derive traffic rules for roads that can never be reached. In practice, this could be done by creating artificial edges without geometry that connect isolated edge lines. Point A relative to the north \u00a7. If the sign is rotated by more than 80\u00ba from the position of the driver, we consider it as sign 0."}, {"heading": "3.3 Rule generation", "text": "For each detected character, a score is calculated, which is applied to it for each outgoing edge with a probability of a single edge. If the edge with the best score is above a threshold of zero, a new rule is generated. However, this can cause a problem if a character of more than one edge or node can be detected due to its proximity and creation of incorrect rules, as shown in Figure 5. To solve it, the newly generated rule is mapped to the character from which it was generated, and can only be replaced if a higher score is reached. The unvisited edges affected by the replaced rules can never be visited naturally, so they must be pushed to the limit, as signaled in Figure 7."}, {"heading": "3.4 Playground experimental results", "text": "The test playground for the development of our algorithm is located in the Spanish city of \u00c1vila, famous for its medieval walls that surround the old district. This fenced-in old district consists of simple one or two lane roads, all at the same level, and no roundabouts, so it is considered an appropriate playground. The inventory of the signs, including their location, orientation and type, was then created using the method described in (Riveiro et al. 2016), which works via a point cloud from a LIDAR system. Their approach is based on the sequential application of cluster algorithms for recognizing traffic signs in the point cloud. These signs are classified by reconstructing their shape and analyzing their geometric properties. For the development and testing of our algorithm and all alternative approaches, we have PostGIS * * and JTS \u2020 Library for spatial data storage and manipulation."}, {"heading": "4 DISCARDED APPROACHES", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 By-Sign static mapping", "text": "The first temptation was to iterate each available sign and try to find out which roads it affected. Theoretically, this is a much simpler solution, as it does not involve navigation and therefore does not require navigation of the net. A two-dimensional cone was projected from the sign, and each affected road had to intersect that cone. An example of two such cones is illustrated in Figure 11 * *. The cone orientation was relative to the azimuth of the sign and depended on the type of the sign. For no-way signs, the cone opposed the azimuth of the sign. For cornering restrictions, cones were projected in two different directions to find the affected roads. In order to select among various possible assessment methods, different assessment methods were tried, ignoring the similarity of the azimuth sign with the next section of the road closer to the actual location of the road network."}, {"heading": "4.2 Navigation mapping with by-edge decision", "text": "In the early versions of the NRD, after navigating into a node, we evaluated each outgoing edge individually by projecting a visual cone toward that edge. If signs were detected, they were analyzed and the generated rules were associated with that edge. Many false rules were created for signs that could fall into different visual cones, but they could be suppressed by associating them with the sign and applying a scoring mechanism, as in Figure 7. The main problem was that signs of the types R-400a, R-400b, and R-400c, although they were supposed to be detected from an intersection, were not necessarily close to an outgoing edge that affected them, if at all. A broader cone could have been used, but it was much more sensible to first detect each sign within a radius of the intersection and then figure out which edge of each sign applies, as was finally done for the NRD in Section 3.3."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We presented a first step for a complex problem and provided a valid proof of the level of traffic rules that would be based on the simulation of a virtual driver. From this point, there are numerous improvements that we made to the NRD to improve character analysis in some complicated cases and to support other types of signs, such as roundabouts and speed limits. When human drivers see a speed limit, they remember this limit until they reach a point at which the limit is exceeded, as if we could be a yield mark or some other speed limit. Since we know that it makes sense to introduce some states into the NRD during navigation, each edge would be marked with a speed limit, as it visited.Real-world applications also require a higher level of complexity than the one we set out in Section 2. We need to support multiple lanes and road markings that could be used to supplement or verify the rules generated by the usual traffic signs. Also, the navigation needs to work with three-dimensional coordination."}], "references": [{"title": "November). From GPS traces to a routable road map", "author": ["L. Cao", "J.
