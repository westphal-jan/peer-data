In total, there are 2,866 documents in this dataset. For each document, there is an image and a text. To represent each image, we split the image into small patches and use a window to extract features from adjacent patches. SIFT's visual features are extracted from each patch. The number of classes in this dataset is 10. A text / image is considered relevant to another text / image if they are in the same class.

We propose to map the data of different modalities to a common space, and in this common space, classification and retrieval can be carried out. Also, in the common space, data of different modalities can be compared, and we use cross-model relevance regulation to compare the differences of the data points. To map the sequences of different modalities, we propose to use the CNN model with multiple filters and max pooling operations. Different modalities have different filter bases, but can map the sequences to a common space. A linear classifier is applied to the results of the cross-model CNN to predict the class names, and we also regulate the results of the CNN by a cross-model relevance term. Experiments on the benchmark data sets show its advantage over the existing cross-model data representation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (D2015207008), Talent Training Project of Hebei Province (A201400215) and Young Prominent Talent Project of Hebei Province Higher School (BJ2014021)."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Abstract A novel data representation method of convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed in this paper to represent data of different modalities.
