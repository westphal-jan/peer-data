Comparing the poems of Li Bai (HB) 2 and Du Fu (HB), two very famous Tang poets, Jiang (2003) presented his observations from close reading, and we showed the differences of poets from the perspective of remote reading (HB et al. 2015).Researchers can focus their research on a particular aspect of CTP, e.g. Pan (2015) presented his observations on words about plants and flowers in Chinese poetry. We consider that colors represent the scenery that could be delivered by a poem; just as audio effects drive the atmosphere in a movie. The most common color in CTP is white (HB / B / 2 /). In this direction, we have some insights about the poets and cultural implications that are related to colors (HB et al. 2015, Cheng et al. 2015).

It is perhaps a little surprising that researchers have tried to investigate connections between poets without the help of modern computers (Wu 1993), although the results are not perfect.In CTP, a poet can mention the name of another poet in the title or in the content of a poem. It is not difficult to determine who was mentioned when the full names were used. CBDB records the alternative names of poets with which we can find further connections between poets. Often, the alternative names are short and contain only one or two characters, and it is not easy to identify the alternative names in the content of the poes.We rely on some heuristics to increase the precision of our SNA analysis.For example, we use the string of alternative names as evidence of the relationship between two poets that contain only one or two characters, and it is not easy to mention the alternative names in the content of the poems."}, {"heading": "3.2 A History of Word Occurrences", "text": "Compiling a comprehensive Chinese dictionary is a huge, if not daunting, task.
