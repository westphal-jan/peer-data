Introduction", "text": "This year, it will only be once before such a scandal occurs."}, {"heading": "2. Credit card fraud", "text": "The illegal use of credit cards or their information without the knowledge of the cardholder is finally referred to as credit card fraud. Various tricks of credit card fraud belong mainly to two groups of application and conduct fraud [3]. Application fraud occurs when fraudsters use new cards from banks or issuing companies that use false or other information. Multiple applications can be submitted by one user with a set of user data (so-called duplication fraud) or by another user with identical details (so-called identity fraud). Behavioral fraud, on the other hand, has four main types: stolen / lost card, postal theft, counterfeit card and \"non-existent cardholder.\" Stolen / lost card fraud occurs when fraudsters steal credit card or gain access to a lost card. Post theft occurs when the fraudster receives a credit card in e-mail or personal information from the bank before reaching the actual cardholder [3]. In both countries, credit card cardholders are \"without the knowledge of and non-present cardholder.\""}, {"heading": "3. Difficulties of Credit Card Fraud Detection", "text": "Unbalanced data: The data to detect credit card fraud is imbalanced in nature, which means that very small percentages of all credit card transactions are fraudulent. Misclassification of a normal transaction as fraud is not as harmful as detection of a fraud transaction as normal, because in the first case the error in classification is identified in further investigations. Overlapping data: Many transactions can be considered fraudulent when in fact they are normal (false positive) and vice versa a a fraudulent transaction can appear legitimate (false negative). The low rate of false positive and false negative transactions in Ukraine is a key challenge for fraud detection systems [4, 5 and 6]."}, {"heading": "4. Credit Card Fraud Detection Techniques", "text": "Credit card fraudsters are classified into two general categories: fraud analysis (abuse detection) and user behavior analysis (anomaly detection).The first group of techniques deals with supervised classification tasks at the transaction level. In these methods, transactions are referred to as fraudulent or normal fraud methods. This data set is then used to create classification models that predict the state (normal or fraud) of new records. There are numerous creation methods for a typical two-tier classification, such as rule initiation [2] and neural networks [3].This approach proves reliable for most fraud attempts observed locally."}, {"heading": "4.1 Artificial Neural Network", "text": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is a set of interconnected nodes designed to mimic the functioning of the human brain [9]. Each node has a weighted connection to several other nodes in adjacent layers. Individual nodes absorb the inputs received from connected nodes and use the weight along with a simple function to calculate output values. Neural networks come in many shapes and architectures. The architecture of the neural network, including the number of hidden layers, the number of nodes within a particular hidden layer and their connectivity, is usually specified by the user based on the complexity of the problem. ANNs can be configured using monitored, unattended or hybrid learning methods."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Supervised techniques", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move to another world, in which they can move to another world."}, {"heading": "4. 1.3 Hybrid supervised and unsupervisedtechniques", "text": "In addition to the supervised and unsupervised learning models of neural networks, some researchers have used hybrid models. John ZhongLeiet.Al. [26] proposed a hybrid supervised (SICLN) and unsupervised (ICLN) learning network for detecting credit card fraud. They improved the reward rule of the SICLN model to ICLN to update weights both after reward and after punishment. This improvement was shown in terms of increasing stability and shortening training time. In addition, the number of final clusters of ICLN is independent of the number of initial network neurons. As a result, the inoperable neurons can be omitted from the clusters by applying the punitive rules.The results showed that both the ICLN and the SICLN are extremely powerful, but the SICLN exceeds known uncontrolled cluster algorithms."}, {"heading": "4.2 Artificial Immune System (AIS)", "text": "The natural immune system is a highly complex system consisting of a complex network of specialized tissues, organs, cells and chemical molecules, which are interconnected and act in a highly coordinated and specific manner when they recognize, remember and eliminate pathogenic foreign cells. Any element that could be recognized by the immune system is called an antigen. Immune system detectors are the antibodies that are capable of recognizing harmful and risky antigens [27]. The immune system consists of the two main responses of the immune system and the acquired immune response. The body's first response to defense is the outer, unbroken skin and the \"mucous membranes\" that line internal channels, such as the respiratory and digestive tracts. If the harmful cells could pass through innate immune defense, the acquired immune response is replaced by the acquired defense."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Negative Selection:", "text": "The Negative Selection Algorithm, or NSA, proposed by [34] is a change detection algorithm based on the T-Cell Generation Process of the biological immune system. It is one of the earliest AIS algorithms to be applied in various real-world applications. Since its initial conception, it has attracted many researchers and practitioners in the AIS and has undergone a phenomenal evolution. NSA has two stages: generation and detection. In the detection phase, detectors are generated and censored by a random process, attempting to compare self-samples. Candidates that match (by affinity higher than affinity threshold) are eliminated and the rest remains as detectors. In the detection phase, detectors (or detector set) are used to verify whether an incoming data entity is independent. If they match (by affinity higher than affinity threshold) with the negative selectivity selection, each anomaly is not claimed or that everyone agrees."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Clonal selection:", "text": "The selection mechanism guarantees that only the clones (antibodies) with a higher affinity for the encountered antigen will survive. On the basis of the clonal selection principle, the clonal selection algorithm was originally proposed in [36] and formally explained in [37]. The general algorithm became CLONALG. Gadiet.al in [36] uses the AIRS for fraud detection on credit card transactions. AIRS is a classification algorithm based on AIS, which uses clonal selection to generate detectors. AIRS generates detectors for all classes in the database and at detection level use the k Nearest Neighbor algorithm (also called K-NN) to classify each dataset. They compared their method with other methods such as neural networks, Bayesian networks and decision trees and claimed that after improving the parameters of the AIRP training system, the AIRP partially improves the results of all the AIRP-RP training methods."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Immune Network:", "text": "The way people behave is nothing new."}, {"heading": "4.2.5 Hybrid AIS or methods", "text": "Some researchers applied different algorithms (i.e. vaccination algorithm, CART, etc.) of the AISalgorithm, which are presented below: Wong [44] introduces the AISCCFD prototype, which was proposed for measuring and managing the memory population and for detecting mutations in real time. In their work, the two algorithms were combined vaccination and negative selection. Results were tested for various types of fraud. The proposed method showed higher detection rates in the application of the immunization algorithm, but certain types of fraud were not accurately detected. Huang et.al [45] presented a novel hybrid model inspired by the artificial immune system to detect fraud by combining triple algorithms: CSPRA, the dendritic cell algorithm (DCA) and CART. Although their proposed method had a high detection rate and a low false alarm, their approach focused on logging of data from AIS and systems limited to ATAR-1 and ATAR-1."}, {"heading": "4.3 Genetic Algorithm (GA)", "text": "Inspired by natural evolution, the genetic algorithms, they were originally introduced by John Holland. They are looking for an optimal solution for the candidates traditionally presented in the form of binary strings. The basic idea is that young people have more chances to survive and reproduce. Candidates \"strengths lie in their ability to solve the underlying problem."}, {"heading": "4.4 Hidden Markov Model (HMM)", "text": "A hidden Markov model is a double-embedded stochastic process applied to much more complex stochastic processes than a traditional Markov model. The underlying system is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved states. In simpler Markov models such as Markov chains, states-defined transition probabilities are only unknown parameters. In contrast, the states of an HMM are hidden, but state-dependent outputs are visible. In the detection of credit card fraud, an HMM is trained to model normal behavior in user profiles [52]. According to this model, a new incoming transaction is classified as fraud if it is not accepted by a model with a sufficiently high probability. Each user profile contains a set of information about the last 10 transactions of this ease of use; category and amount for each transaction [52, 53 and 54]. HMM produces a high false positive rate [55].Bhusal et al."}, {"heading": "4.5 Support Vector Machine (SVM)", "text": "In fact, the majority of them will be able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move"}, {"heading": "4.6 Bayesian Network", "text": "A Bayesian network is a graphical model that represents conditional dependencies between random variables, and the underlying graphical model is in the form of a directed acyclic graph. bayesian networks are useful for finding unknown probabilities in the presence of uncertainty [66]. Bayesian networks can play an important and effective role in modelling situations where some basic information is already known but incoming data is uncertain or partially unavailable [67], [68], [69]. The objective of applying the Bayes rules is often to predict the class sign associated with a particular vector of characteristics or attributes [70]. Bayesian networks have been successfully applied to various areas of interest, e.g. preventing prevention [71] in business, pattern recognition in vision [72], generating diagnoses in medicine [73] and detecting network fraud [74] as well as predicting this error in networks [74]."}, {"heading": "4.7 Fuzzy Logic Based System", "text": "Fuzzy Logic based system is the system based on fuzzy rules. Fuzzy Logic systems address theUncertainty of the input and output variables by definition fuzzy sets and numbers to express values in form of linguistic variables (e.g. small, medium and large). Two important types of these systems are Fuzzy Neural Network and Fuzzy Darwinian system.4.7.1Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) The goal of using Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) is to learn from the large number of uncertain and imprecise records of information, which is very common in real world applications [80]. Fuzzy Neural Networks propose [81] to apply rules to accelerate the detection of fraud in customized credit cards. In this study, authors applied the method GNN (Granular Neural Network), which implements blurred neural networks based on the discovery of knowledge (FNNKD), to accelerate the thetraining network and detection of fuzzy Darwinian System, which is an extremely complex Darwinian system."}, {"heading": "4.8 Expert Systems", "text": "The rules of the expert system are applicable to perform operations on the basis of data in order to draw appropriate conclusions from it. Powerful and flexible solutions to many application problems are refuted by expert systems. Financial analysis and fraud detection are one of the general areas in which they can be applied. By applying expert systems, suspicious activity or transactions can be detected from deviations from \"normal\" spending patterns [84]. In [85], the authors presented a model for detecting credit card fraud in different payment channels. In their model, a blurred expert system indicates the unusual degree to which the new transaction is fraudulent compared to user behavior. The weight of the fraud tendency is achieved by user behavior analysis. Therefore, this system is called FUZZGY. Another suggested expert system model for detecting fraud by financial institutions is also applicable."}, {"heading": "4.9 Inductive logic programming (ILP)", "text": "The ILP uses a number of positive and negative examples to define a concept. Complex relationships between components or attributes can easily be expressed in this classification approach, and the effectiveness of the system is enhanced by domain knowledge that can easily be represented in an ILP system [87]. Muggleton et al. [88] proposed the model that uses marked data for fraud detection, which is used using relational learning approaches such as inductive logic programming (ILP) and simple homophile-based classifiers on relational databases. Perlich, et al. [89] also propose new target-based recognition techniques to turn the problem of relational learning into a conventional problem."}, {"heading": "4.10 Case-based reasoning (CBR)", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it is only a matter of time before a decision is reached in which a decision is reached."}, {"heading": "6.

It becomes an unavoidable part of household, business and global activities. Although using credit cards provides enormous benefits when used carefully and responsibly,significant credit and financial damagesmay be causedby fraudulent activities. Many techniques have been proposed to confront thegrowthin credit card fraud. However, all of these techniques have the same goal of avoiding the credit card fraud; each one has its own drawbacks, advantages and characteristics. In this paper, after investigating difficultiesof credit card fraud detection, we seek to review the state of the art in credit card fraud detection techniques, datasets and evaluation criteria.The advantages and disadvantages of fraud detection methods are enumerated and compared.Furthermore, a classification of mentioned techniques into two main fraud detection approaches, namely, misuses (supervised) and anomaly detection (unsupervised) is presented. Again, a classification of techniques is proposed based on capability to process the numerical and categorical datasets. Different datasets used in literatureare then described and grouped into real and synthesized data and the effective and common attributesare extracted for further usage.Moreover, evaluation employed criterions in literature are collected and discussed.Consequently, open issues for credit card fraud detection are explained as guidelinesfor", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
