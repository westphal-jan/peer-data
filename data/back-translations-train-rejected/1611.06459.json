Social media is now an indispensable mode of communication; online gaming is not only a genuine social activity but also a popular spectator sport. With support for anonymity and larger audiences, online interaction shrinks social and geographical barriers. Despite such benefits, social disparities such as gender inequality persist in online social media. In particular, online gaming communities have been criticized for persistent gender disparities and objectification. As gaming evolves into a social platform, persistence of gender disparity is a pressing question. Yet, there are few large-scale, systematic studies of gender inequality and objectification in social gaming platforms. Here we analyze more than one billion chat messages from Twitch, a social game-streaming platform, to study how the gender of streamers is associated with the nature of conversation. Using a combination of computational text analysis methods, we show that gendered conversation and objectification is prevalent in chats. Female streamers receive significantly more objectifying comments while male streamers receive more game-related comments. This difference is more pronounced for popular streamers. There also exists a large number of users who post only on female or male streams. Employing a neural vector-space embedding (paragraph vector) method, we analyze gendered chat messages and create prediction models that (i) identify the gender of streamers based on messages posted in the channel and (ii) identify the gender a viewer prefers to watch based on their chat messages. Our findings suggest that disparities in social game-streaming platforms is a nuanced phenomenon that involves the gender of streamers as well as those who produce gendered and game-related conversation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 20 Nov 2016 01:21:31 GMT  (8014kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06459v1", "10 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables"], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 21:49:40 GMT  (8014kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06459v2", "10 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["supun nakandala", "giovanni luca ciampaglia", "norman makoto su", "yong-yeol ahn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06459"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.06459.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Gendered Conversation in a Social Game-Streaming Platform", "authors": ["Supun Nakandala", "Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia", "Norman Makoto Su", "Yong-Yeol Ahn"], "emails": ["yyahn}@iu.edu", "permissions@acm.org."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords Text Analysis, Gender, Social Gaming, Online ChatPermission to make digital or printed copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted free of charge, provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial purposes, and that copies bear this notice and the full quotation on the first page.

For each message, the following information is available: timestamp, author, channel and text. Author and channel are identified by screen name; for the channel this is the screen name of the streamer. Similar to other social media, the activity and popularity of Twitch channels are highly distorted. We can quantify them by the number of messages produced by each user and channel, as well as the number of users chatting on a channel (for popularity)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Statistically Overrepresented Words", "text": "As our first exploratory analysis, we find that unigrams and bigrams are over-represented in male or female streamers, using log odds ratios using the informative dirichlet method [26], which estimates the log odds ratio of each word w between two corpora i and j taking into account the previous frequencies obtained from a background corpus \u03b1.

This common embedding not only allows us to perform vector operations between documents and words, but it has been argued that it outperforms other embedding methods in document similarity tasks [30].
