We employ an ontology of disease related concepts and use it to obtain a conceptual representation of tweets.

We achieve this by training learners on concepts rather than individual words. For training we use a dataset containing mentions of influenza and Listeria and use the learned models to classify datasets containing mentions of an arbitrary selection of other diseases. We show that our ontological approach achieves good performance on this task using a variety of Natural Language Processing Techniques. We also show that word vectors can be learned directly from our concepts to achieve even better results.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Nov 2016 07:32:56 GMT  (1192kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06671v1", "19 pages, 7 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages, 7 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["mark abraham magumba", "peter nabende"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06671"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.06671.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Ontology Driven Disease Incidence Detection on Twitter", "authors": ["Mark Abraham Magumba", "Peter Nabende"], "emails": ["magumbamark@hotmail.com", "peter.nabende@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Unlike previous keyword-based systems and thematic modeling approaches, our ontological approach allows us to apply stricter criteria to determine which messages are relevant, such as spatial and temporal characteristics, while giving a stronger guarantee that the resulting models will perform well on new data that may differ lexically.

However, user data such as messages and user searches from such platforms have been used both to monitor individual diseases, as well as to monitor Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends for Influenza and Dengue Fever [Google.com 2016] or to monitor multiple diseases, for example, through HealthMap.org. These systems are generally based on a set of disease-related keywords that filter a stream of documents to obtain only those that are relevant. In this context, documents take the form of messages posted by users; for example, documents are \"tweets,\" which are short messages (limited to 140 characters in length), while in Facebook, documents are \"wall posts, comments\" page feeds, to mention just a few."}], "references": [{"title": "Creating speech and language data with amazon\u2019s", "author": ["C.
