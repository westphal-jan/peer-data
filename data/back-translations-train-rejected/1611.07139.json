However, these systems rely mostly on the web for finding information. Mobile and wearable devices can collect an enormous amount of contextual personal data such as sleep and physical activities. These information objects and their applications are known as quantified-self, mobile health or personal informatics, and they can be used to provide a deeper insight into our behavior. To our knowledge, existing personal assistant systems do not support all types of quantified-self queries. In response to this, we have undertaken a user study to analyze a set of \"textual questions/queries\" that users have used to search their quantified-self or mobile health data. Through analyzing these questions, we have constructed a light-weight natural language based query interface, including a text parser algorithm and a user interface, to process the users' queries that have been used for searching quantified-self information. This query interface has been designed to operate on small devices, i.e. smartwatches, as well as augmenting the personal assistant systems by allowing them to process end users' natural language queries about their quantified-self data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 03:42:44 GMT  (549kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07139v1", "6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["reza rawassizadeh", "chelsea dobbins", "manouchehr nourizadeh", "zahra ghamchili", "michael pazzani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.07139"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.07139.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "A. User Study", "text": "Goal: To implement a query interface based on personal data, we need to understand: (i) what types of knowledge do users seek from their available personal data (on their mobile or portable devices)? (ii) How do users ask to search for the information they want? To answer both questions, we have a survey on MTurk.Participants: For the user study, Bargas-Avila and Hornb\u00e6k [13] recommend focusing not only on users who are familiar with a system for a user study, but also on users who are not familiar with the system. Therefore, our eligibility criteria include participants who own smartphones, but they do not necessarily need to be familiar with QA systems. Survey results show that users who are not familiar with QA technologies raise several interesting questions. This insight allows for better quantification of final requests and even covers queries for the sensors that do not yet exist, such as a sensor that does not need to be washed or a cloth."}, {"heading": "B. Content Analysis and Query Construction", "text": "We have performed two types of analyses of the data collected by MTurk: qualitative analyses using thematic analyses and quantitative analyses using linguistic analyses. We then construct the query parser and its user interface based on both analyses."}, {"heading": "1) Thematic Analysis", "text": "A researcher has examined this text and identified themes.Another researcher has analysed the results, and in most queries a consensus has been reached. On the basis of Fleiss Kappa, the Interrater reliability, k = 0.74. Based on the interpretation of Landis and Koch [15], this is a substantial agreement between two researchers. Table 1 shows the categorisation of queries based on \"inductive thematic analysis.\" Identified topics in Table 1 show that there are limited categories of queries that a user could use to search his personal data archive. This result has been made the basis of our linguistic analysis algorithm."}, {"heading": "2) Linguistic Analysis", "text": "To perform the quantitative analysis, we asked the questions implicitly, deleted punctuations and stopped terms, and determined the frequency of the words in the collected queries; the thematic analysis shows the limitations of the queries and their categories; the results show that there are four categories of words: (i) question words, (ii) words that represent a temporal term of the query; (ii) words that represent the subject of the query, e.g. sleep, walking, and (iv) aggregation words. Our algorithm also uses verb tense for the query construction, which will be explained later. Figure 1 (a, b, c) records the frequency of words in the categories i, ii, and iii that have been used 10 or more times. To preserve space, we do not use plotaggregation words, including: average, miles, quantity, next, last, more frequent, daily, etc. Queries that represent the query as an explicit query."}, {"heading": "3) Tokenization & Lexicon Extraction Algorithm", "text": "Many of the existing NLP systems [8,9,10] create a \"parse tree\" from the given query, which is in text format. Parse tree creation is a mathematically complex process, but can be used to handle a variety of texts. However, our approach does not have to cover a wide range of questions. Instead, we focus on QA queries. Furthermore, smartwatches cannot deal with existing parse tree creation algorithms, which usually comprise more than one sentence. In the evaluation section, we describe this in more detail. Here, question words (tokenization elements) are limited and known (at least to some extent). QA queries are usually simple sentences and it is rare for queries to comprise more than one sentence. Therefore, we can analyze input queries based on the identified word categories as a \"bag of words.\" However, the bag has words that do not parse style."}, {"heading": "C.
