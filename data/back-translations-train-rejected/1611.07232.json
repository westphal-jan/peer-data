In addition, most existing methods only consider the direct links between entities, ignoring the vital impact about the semantic of relation paths. In this paper, we study the problem of how to better embed entities and relations into different low dimensional spaces. A compositional learning model of relation paths embedding (RPE) is proposed to take full advantage of additional semantic information expressed by relation paths. More specifically, using corresponding projection matrices, RPE can simultaneously embed entities into corresponding relation and path spaces. It is also suggested that type constraints could be extended from traditional relation-specific to the new proposed path-specific ones. Both of the two type constraints can be seamlessly incorporated into RPE and decrease the errors in prediction. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets and the proposed model achieves significant and consistent improvements compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms for knowledge base completion.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 10:11:56 GMT  (1910kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07232v1", "9 Pages,1 figure"], ["v2", "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 13:07:30 GMT  (1910kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07232v2", "9 pages,1 figure"], ["v3", "Tue, 20 Dec 2016 07:11:26 GMT  (1911kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07232v3", "9 pages,1 figure"], ["v4", "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 04:12:56 GMT  (1910kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07232v4", "7 pages,1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "9 Pages,1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xixun lin", "yanchun liang", "fausto giunchiglia", "xiaoyue feng", "renchu guan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.07232"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.07232.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Compositional Learning of Relation Path Embedding for Knowledge Base Completion", "authors": ["Xixun Lin", "Yanchun Liang", "Fausto Giunchiglia", "Xiaoyue Feng", "Renchu Guan"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 161 1.07 232v 4 [cs.C L] 24 Feb 20"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves, \"he said in an interview with the\" New York Times, \"in which he said the role of the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times, the\" the \"the\" the \"the\""}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "First, we will focus on three classic translation-based models that consider only direct connections between entities: the lower case letter v denotes a column vector, and the upper case letter M denotes a matrix.

However, this type of consistent semantics of reliable relation paths cannot be achieved by translation-based models such as Trans (E, H, R), since translation-based models only utilize the direct links and do not take into account relationship paths, such as reliable relation paths in lines 3 and 6 of Table 5. In contrast, RPE can achieve reliable relation paths with its consistent semantics and expands the projection and type limitations of the specific relation to the specific path. Furthermore, the experimental results show that RPE exceeds the level of knowledge and type limitations in the two additional semantics by using benchmarks."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we propose a compositional learning model of the Relationship Path Embedding (RPE) to complete the knowledge base. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a path-specific projection has been proposed, and it simultaneously embeds each unit in relation and path spaces to learn more meaningful embedding. In addition, we also present the novel path-specific type constraints based on relation-specific constraints to better distinguish similar embedding in latent space. In the future, we plan to include 1) other potential semantic information in the modeling of the relationship path, such as the information provided by these intermediate nodes linked by relation paths, and 2) the relationship path in other applications related to knowledge bases, such as remote monitoring for the extraction of relationships and answering questions about knowledge bases."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors are grateful for the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61572228, No. 61472158, No. 61300147 and No. 61602207), the Jilin Province Science Technology Development Project (No. 20140520070JH and No. 20160101247JC), the Premier Discipline Enhancement Scheme of the Zhuhai Government and the Premier Key-Discipline Enhancement Scheme of the Guangdong Government and the Smart Society Collaborative Project, which is funded by the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission for Research and Technological Development under Funding Agreement No. 600854."}], "references": [{"title": "CoRR", "author": ["Sungjin Ahn", "Heeyoul Choi", "Tanel P\u00e4rnamaa", "Yoshua Bengio.

however, these knowledge bases are still far from complete. In addition, most of the existing methods for knowledge base completion only consider the direct links between entities, ignoring the vital impact of the consistent semantics of relation paths. In this paper, we study the problem of how to better embed entities and relations of knowledge bases into different low-dimensional spaces by taking full advantage of the additional semantics of relation paths, and we propose a compositional learning model of relation path embedding (RPE). Specifically, with the corresponding relation and path projections, RPE can simultaneously embed each entity into two types of latent spaces. It is also proposed that type constraints could be extended from traditional relation-specific constraints to the new proposed path-specific constraints. The results of experiments show that the proposed model achieves significant and consistent improvements compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
