Yet this is a major issue when considering the use of elastic distances which are characterized by a quadratic complexity along the time axis. We present in this paper an evaluation of straightforward approaches aiming at reducing the dimensionality of the matrix M for each movement, leading to consider both the dimensionality reduction of the feature vector as well as its reduction along the time axis. The dimensionality reduction of the feature vector is achieved by selecting remarkable joints in the skeleton performing the movement, basically the extremities of the articulatory chains composing the skeleton. The temporal dimen-sionality reduction is achieved using either a regular or adaptive down-sampling that seeks to minimize the reconstruction error of the movements. Elastic and Euclidean kernels are then compared through support vector machine learning. Two data sets 1 that are widely referenced in the domain of human gesture recognition, and quite distinctive in terms of quality of motion capture, are used for the experimental assessment of the proposed approaches. On these data sets we experimentally show that it is feasible, and possibly desirable, to significantly reduce simultaneously the size of the feature vector and the number of skeleton frames to represent body movements while maintaining a very good recognition rate. The method proves to give satisfactory results at a level currently reached by state-of-the-art methods on these data sets. We experimentally show that the computational complexity reduction that is obtained makes this approach eligible for real-time applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 13:18:17 GMT  (1196kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07781v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["pierre-fran\\c{c}ois marteau", "sylvie gibet", "cl\\'ement reverdy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.07781"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.07781.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Adaptive Down-Sampling and Dimension Reduction in Elastic Kernel Machines for Efficient Recognition of Isolated Gestures", "authors": ["Pierre-Francois Marteau"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the scope of the feature vector representing motion is generally quite large, especially when whole body movements are taken into account.

In this section, we will give a brief and non-exhaustive overview of the literature associated with each challenge. Dimension Reduction The problem of dimensionality reduction (also referred to as multifaceted learning) can be applied with the aim of finding a low-dimensional space that best represents the variance of the data without losing too much information. Action descriptors have therefore been defined to characterize entire motion sequences or punctual frames that require an additional step of temporal modeling in order to achieve the detection goal. Numerous methods are available to perform such dimensionality reduction, with the most popular linear approaches such as Component 1986, Jollisis [A] and Masolose Colliffe."}, {"heading": "3 Motion representation", "text": "In recent years, there has been an increasing availability of these databases, some of them are captured by high-resolution devices (infrared marker tracking system), such as those provided by CMU [cmu mocap db, 2003], HDM05 [M\u00fcller et al., 2007], and others that are captured by low-cost devices, such as MSRAction3D with the Microsoft Kinect system. With the first type of sensors, the capture process is expensive, as it requires multiple cameras with many markers on a player for capturing skilled movements with good accuracy, and a post-processing pipeline that is costly in time and expertise. Instead, the second type of sensors that capture data is affordable and requires less time and expertise, but with a loss of accuracy that remains acceptable for some tasks.After recording, the captured data is filtered and reconstructed, eliminating most of the noise, data losses to laboratories and losses."}, {"heading": "4 Dimension reduction of motion capture data", "text": "The use of elastic distances or cores to detect problems has proven to be very precise and efficient. However, one of the greatest difficulties of such methods with time series data is to deal with their computing costs, generally square with the length of the time series and linear with the spatial dimension, which is characterized by the number of degrees of freedom. This high computing complexity potentially limits their use, especially when large amounts of data need to be processed or when real-time limitations are required. Therefore, we expect that a two-dimensional reduction is particularly relevant on both the time and space axes, especially in connection with these techniques. Therefore, we propose to show that there is a spatio-temporal redundancy in motion data that can be exploited. Given the fairly rich literature on motion detection, it seems that some studies have shown success with the reduction of dimensionality on the spatial axis, but very few have directly addressed one of the dimensionality on the two dimensions in 2009, which is much smaller."}, {"heading": "4.1 Dimension reduction along the spatial axis", "text": "Dimensional reduction (or manifold learning) is the process of mapping high-dimensional data to representations that lie in low-dimensional multiplicity, which can be interpreted as mapping the data into a space characterized by a smaller dimension from which most of the variability of the data is reproducible. In this paper, we consider a more direct approach based on knowledge of the mechanism underlying the production of movement data and the way people perceive and distinguish body movements. We assume that the perception of human movements is better achieved in the so-called task space, which is represented by a selection of significant 3D articular trajectories. This hypothesis is supported by [Giese et al., 2008] which show that visual perception of body movements closely mirrors the physical similarities between articular trajectories. This is also consistent with Gibet's [motor perception of body movements] theory presented in 2011."}, {"heading": "4.2 Dimension reduction along the time axis", "text": "The simple approach we are developing to explicitly reduce dimensionality along the timeline is to scan the motion data in such a way that each motion sequence takes the form of a specified sequence of L-skeletal bearings. Then, it becomes easy to perform a classification or recognition task by using elastic kernel machines on such fixed sequences. In such an approach, performance rates depend on the selected degree of partial sampling. This approach seems coarse, since long sequences are characterized by the same number of skeletal bearings as short sequences. In very short sequences, whose length is shorter than L, if any, we trick the sequence to meet the requirement for fixed size. However, we consider this case to be very marginal, as we are aiming for a subsampling rate that is much lower than the average sampling rate of motion length."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Uniform down-sampling", "text": "In order to explicitly reduce dimensionality along the timeline, our first simple approach is to scan the motion data downwards so that each trajectory takes the form of a defined sequence of L-skeletal postures distributed evenly across the timeline. We call this approach Uniform Scanning (UDS)."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Adaptive down-sampling", "text": "The second approach is the so-called adaptive down-sampling approach (ADS). Similar to UDS, each trajectory takes the form of a specified sequence of L-skeletal postures, but these postures are no longer evenly distributed along the timeline; they are selected to minimize a criterion for reconstructing the trajectory. In essence, we are following the previous work of [Marteau and Gibet, 2006]. A data modeling approach is used to handle the adaptive scanning of the multidimensional and discrete time series of {Yt}. Specifically, we are seeking to approximate Y to Yum, such as: \u03b8 = ArgMin. (E ({Yt}, {Y\u03b8, t}) (1), where E is the RMS error between Y and Yt circumference selected within the series of piecemeal linear approximations of Y.

We present in this paper an evaluation of straightforward approaches aiming at reducing the dimensionality of the matrix M for each movement, leading to consider both the dimensionality reduction of the feature vector as well as its reduction along the time axis. The dimensionality reduction of the feature vector is achieved by selecting remarkable joints in the skeleton performing the movement, basically the extremities of the articulatory chains composing the skeleton. The temporal dimensionality reduction is achieved using either a regular or adaptive down-sampling that seeks to minimize the reconstruction error of the movements. Elastic and Euclidean kernels are then compared through support vector machine learning.
