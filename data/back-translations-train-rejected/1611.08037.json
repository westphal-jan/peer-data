INTRODUCTIONThe rapid advancement of intelligent vehicle technologies enables us to imagine that in the future autonomous vehicles will be able to perform various tasks with little or no human effort. We are interested in designing an efficient routing method to navigate a vehicle (agent) among a number of known and fixed depots, with each depot showing some gain (e.g. points, benefits, benefits, loads) that needs to be collected. If the travel time is limited, it is likely that the agent will not be able to traverse all depots due to the limited time budget. This variant of routing problems is called an orientation problem (OP). In short, an OP aims to traverse a subset of depots so that the accumulated gain from these traversed depots is maximized."}, {"heading": "II.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION AND FORMULATION", "text": "A routing problem can be represented with a diagram G = (V, E), where V indicates the set of links and E the set of edges. Let's call the number of links V1 and assume that each edge takes time to exceed. Although, in many situations, the travel time depends on the states and characteristics of the network such as congestion and capacity, we assume that the travel time between two links vi and vj is time-invariant for simplicity. We associate each visit relatively simply to incorporate time-dependent travel times into our proposed model, which is described in the following section. Vertex vi with a time-varying value, called profit, which is denoted by fi (t) \u2265 0. Here fi (\u00b7) is of arbitrary nonlinear form of function. We assume that the function fi (\u00b7) is known or can be predicted or approximated."}, {"heading": "IV. A SPATIO-TEMPORAL REPRESENTATION", "text": "It seems to be a daunting task to solve the problem (1) - (8) due to the complexity of the objective function (3). Most of the existing literature in OPs either lumps all the constraints together and solves them by conventional solvers of MIPs [20], [22], or decouples the constraints in master subproblem modules such as column generation [2], or uses certain heuristics such as the center of gravity heuristically [11]. In contrast, the desire to develop a framework that is intuitive to understand is easy to implement, and flexibly modify and expand. In this section, we present a means of embedding constraints in a spatio-temporal representation, on which the original routing problem can be addressed by efficient methods (although it is a NP-hard problem).Since the problem essentially aims to determine the time of visits and the order of the linkages of the graphics that inspire us in a dimensional expansion of time."}, {"heading": "V. ROUTING ALGORITHM", "text": "An important advantage of the spatio-temporal graph is that the time constraints have been incorporated into this spatio-temporal representation, so that time constraints can be decoupled and eliminated from the process of profit optimization. Thus, the problem (1) - (8) is tantamount to searching for a path P from the vertex v \u2032 0.0 = (v0, 0) to v \u2032 ks on G \u2032, where s \u2264 T is like the problem of profit maximization by accumulating the profits collected from the vertex points is maximum. Since the spatio-temporal graph is essentially a DAG, we develop our route solution by extending classical DAG algorithms. Specifically, we have found that profit maximization can become a longest path problem by collecting the gains from the vertex points rather than adding up edge lengths along a path. We manipulate the DAG so that the vertex points in a maximum topological order, we then deal with the route planning along the time-dynamic dimension and a profitable one."}, {"heading": "A. Topological Sorting of DAG in Temporal Dimension", "text": "The main purpose of the topological sorting of the DAG is that the vertices \"are set to different\" stages, \"according to their time constraints, so that a dynamic programming structure (which is discussed in the following section) can be applied.\" Formally, a topological type of a directed graph is a linear order of its vertices, so that for each directed edge euv comes from vertex u to vertex v, u before v in order. A topological type of graph requires that the graph must be a DAG. We use a well-known algorithm developed by Kahn [14] to sort our spatio-temporal graph G, with the most important steps in Alg. \u2212 2. In short, we first find a list of vertices that have no incoming edges (with deg \u2212 (v) = 0), and insert them into a row S: the same vertix: at least one such vertix must exist."}, {"heading": "B. Computing Maximal Profit Path", "text": "The classic problem with the longest path is the problem of finding a simple path of maximum length in a given chart. We use a dynamic programming structure to store the currently valid maximum cumulative gain at each vertex of the topologically sorted stages. Note that in our problem we need to optimize the gains from the vertex instead of adding the length of the edges. So, instead of using the longest path update function between two consecutive stages: l [w] = l [v] + \u03c4vw > l [w], (9) where l [w] is the greatest distance from the starting point, we use an update function: w.sum = v.sum + w.profit > w.profit > w.sum. (10) The compilation of the maximum profit path is described in Alg. 3. In short, the topologically sorted vertex V \u00b2.j."}, {"heading": "C. Main Routing Algorithm", "text": "With the components described above, the main algorithm is represented in Alg. 4. According to the analysis of each part, the total time complexity of our algorithm is n2T / \u2206 t, and also the spatial complexity is n2T / \u0445 t. Algorithm 4: Time-Varying OP Input: 1: 2D Graph G = (V, E), starting point v0, time limit T, time interval \u2206 tOutput: 2: Constructing a spatio-temporal graph G \u2032 = SpatioTemporalGraph (G, T, v0, \u0445 t) 3: L = TopologicalSort (G \u2032) 4: Path = Maximum ProfitPath (L) 5: Return path Our algorithm has a polynomial time complexity that, when specifying a specified \u0394t, but cannot guarantee to find the optimal solution to this NP-Hard problem. The main reason for the possible achievement of a sutimality is that we may not seek an optimal one between the individual and a subdivided time (1)."}, {"heading": "D. Discussion: Effects of Discretization", "text": "The time interval does not play a decisive role in our framework, since the total gains are actually distributed gradually over several time periods during the travel period. However, it may be impractical to select a sufficiently small time interval because it would lead to an extremely large size of the DAG. One possible implementation is to round the travel time to a value corresponding to some integer periods. Therefore, it is important to analyze the effects of errors due to such a rounding procedure.Let us assume that the profit function fi (t) fulfills the following Lipschitz condition: | fi (t) \u2212 fi (s) | t \u2212 s \u2212 s |, s \u00b2, [0, T], i \u00b2 n \u00b2, n \u00b2, where K is a constant independent of i. Let us assume that the optimal objective value for the problem (1) - (8) z and the optimal objective value for the proposed frame z. Then we have the result as a consequence: Under G (11) for an objective value."}, {"heading": "VI. RESULTS", "text": "We performed numerical evaluations to validate the proposed algorithm. We compared our algorithm with other algorithms, all implemented in C + +. Experiments were performed on a system with an Intel i5 2.2GHz processor and 4GB RAM. In our experiments, vertices are randomly generated in the range [\u2212 50, 50] \u00d7 [\u2212 50, 50] on the x-y plane, and each vertice has a gain (weight) according to certain temporally varying functions. The distance between two vertices is Euclidean distance."}, {"heading": "A. Routing Feature of \u201cOrienteering\u201d", "text": "First, we show that our solution has the basic orientation characteristic: in view of limited time, the path always leads through these vertices with large profits. Figure 3 (a) shows an example. We deliberately manipulate the distribution of profits between the vertices so that there are more vertices with larger profits in the upper right corner. For better visualization, the size of a vertice is proportional to the profit on it. In addition, we deliberately set the starting point to the left and do not specify a target. From Figure 3 (a) we can see that the path to make more profits leads almost directly from the starting point to the upper right corner. Thus, a large part of the time is spent traversing these vertices with large profits."}, {"heading": "B. Routing Properties under Temporal Variations", "text": "In order to study the effects caused by time variations, we manipulate the profit functions. Specifically, we divide space into four regions (quadrants) I, II, III and IV, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). Profits are the same if the vertices are in the same region, but different if not. In Region I, for example, the profit function for each v \u00b2 es fi (t) I = {5wi if t > T / 2 0, if t > T / 2wo wi is the weight of the vertex vi in Chart G. (Note that wi differs from w \u00b2, which varies over time. Here, the weight wi refers to a fixed parameter for the profit function.) Similarly, profit functions in regions II, III and IV arefi (t) II = 10wi if t 6 T / 2 0 if t / 2 is greater than the first vertex in Figure T / 2fi (t) III = {0 if t if t > 6 T / 2fi (t) (t)."}, {"heading": "C. Comparison with Optimal Solution", "text": "Due to the prohibitive time complexity O (n!) for finding the optimal solution, the practical runtime for 13 vertices requires more than 10 minutes. Therefore, we tested up to 12 vertices to be able to compare with the optimal solutions. We examined three representative winning functions in the form of linear, square and logarithmic. The results are in Fig. 4. We see that the results of our algorithm are very close to those of the optimal solutions for all three functions. Fig. 5 shows a group of paths generated from our algorithm and the optimal solution. We use a linear profit fi (t) = wit / T. In many cases, our algorithm gets the same results as those of the optimal solution as in Fig. 5 (a) and Fig. Sometimes the paths are different than in Fig."}, {"heading": "D. Comparison with Classic OP Algorithm", "text": "We also compared our algorithm with the classical OP algorithms. We implemented a well-known heuristics called Focus [11] and tested it with both time-invariant and time-variable gains. Figure 6 shows the differences between the results of our approach and those of OP.Fig.7 shows statistics of numerical evaluations with 200 vertices. We see that our algorithm exceeds the OP for both time-invariant and time-variable gains. In particular, the difference span for the time-varying gains is greater. In fact, the classical OP cannot handle time-varying gains and the entire profit curve converges quickly (with a fixed time T, the total gain of the OP no longer grows with the increase in the number of vertices).The runtime is compared in Fig. 7 (c), from which we can observe that our algorithm in practice takes less time than that of the OP with the emphasis on Heuristics."}, {"heading": "E. Path Quality under Different Time Intervals", "text": "In the table, the numbers in the first row are interval values and the numbers in the first column are the number of vertices. The remaining values are the accumulated gains from our algorithm. We see that the quality of the route is generally better when the time interval is smaller. Of course, a smaller time interval inevitably leads to a larger diagram and therefore requires a longer runtime."}, {"heading": "F. Demonstration with New York Taxi Data", "text": "We show that the proposed algorithm can be used for (autonomous) taxi routes. Fig. 8 shows real data of taxi calls in New York City. The data comes from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission [1]. We use the Kmeans cluster algorithm to group the total New York taxi calls into 50 local regions, as shown in Fig. 9 (a). The cluster centers are shown in Fig. 9 (b). We assume that each pick-up and subsequent drop-off takes place in the same local region and each pick-up and drop-off is counted as the conclusion of a service. Then, a taxi driver aims to maximize profit by offering more services over a fixed period of time. In each region, we calculate the total number of taxi calls in each predefined time unit (e.g. minute), and an example is shown in Fig. 10. We consider the total number of taxi calls in a region to be 150 varying gains, and further gains to 50 T = it:"}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We presented a framework for solving the orientation problem with time-varying gains. Instead of following traditional routines for mixed integer program solutions, we developed an intuitive and effective framework that incorporates time variations into the basic planning process. Specifically, we first constructed a deterministic space-time representation, where both spatial description and temporal logic are combined in a routing topology, and then expanded existing sorting and search algorithms so that routing solutions can be calculated most efficiently. Finally, we validated our algorithm with numerical evaluations, and the results show that our framework produces near-optimal solutions in a very efficient way."}], "references": [{"title": "Team orienteering problem with decreasing profits", "author": ["H.M.

"abstractText": "We consider an orienteering problem (OP) where an agent needs to visit a series (possibly a subset) of depots, from which the maximal accumulated profits are desired within given limited time budget. Different from most existing works where the profits are assumed to be static, in this work we investigate a variant that has arbitrary time-dependent profits. Specifically, the profits to be collected change over time and they follow different (e.g., independent) time-varying functions. The problem is of inherent nonlinearity and difficult to solve by existing methods. To tackle the challenge, we present a simple and effective framework that incorporates time-variations into the fundamental planning process. Specifically, we propose a deterministic spatio-temporal representation where both spatial description and temporal logic are unified into one routing topology. By employing existing basic sorting and searching algorithms, the routing solutions can be computed in an extremely efficient way. The proposed method is easy to implement and extensive numerical results show that our approach is time efficient and generates near-optimal solutions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
