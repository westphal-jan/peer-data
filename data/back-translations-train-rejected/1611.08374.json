Introduction", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "2. Method", "text": "In order to collect data on the state of decision support systems research in the fisheries and aquaculture sector, we apply a systematic literature review. In this way, we comply with a known and defined method that ensures reproducibility and diligence while gaining knowledge of the field and answering our research questions.This mapping study was conducted in accordance with a pre-defined protocol that was created for this study to reduce the possibility of a researcher bias [8].The review protocol is an essential component for providing context and domain classification, and a protocol must be developed separately for each mapping study to define the key guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies. Both Kitchenham [8] and Budgen et al. [9] notes that the research questions in mapping studies are likely to be broader than in traditional systematic literature reviews (SLR) to address the broader scope of the study."}, {"heading": "2.1. Rigor of Study", "text": "This year we have reached the stage where there will never be a process of this kind, where the question is to what extent it is a country, where it is a country, where it is a country."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "The method used to identify relevant studies can be divided into three discrete steps, the first stage being the application of the search query to data sources, the first of which resulted in 510,681 hits. As a result, the search queries were refined to match the search results listed in the previous section. By applying the refined search queries to all sources, it returned a total of 146 results. Specifically, all five search results were applied to all search engines; the five results from each source were summarized, sorted and then compared with any other source; the resulting 146 documents were the largest common denominator of these sources; after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the sum of manual and automatic searches added up to a total of 70 documents."}, {"heading": "3.1. Reading and selective filtering", "text": "The data set of 70 articles was evaluated separately, and each evaluator was required to compile a list of all papers supplemented by a brief description of the work and its contribution to the research questions that this study was intended to solve. Studies that did not contribute to answering any of the research questions were excluded, the evaluators said, and the separate evaluations were discussed and compared to accurately assess whether or not the work should be used in the study. To determine the contribution of the articles, a majority decision had to be made on the basis of the compiled lists to avoid any particular research distortion, and the comparison of the papers resulted in an additional exclusion of 43 papers. Figure 1 summarizes how we conducted the selection process and presents the number of papers that were identified at each step of the search process. Annex A presents a complete list of the 27 selected studies, numbered from SID-1 to SID-27."}, {"heading": "4. Analysis", "text": "This analysis is largely based on the research questions of the mapping study and is essentially limited to two questions: What decision-making systems from fisheries and aquaculture exist and what empirical results do these systems provide, especially with regard to real-time analysis?"}, {"heading": "4.1. Classification of selected studies and results", "text": "We present our results in the form of a qualitative synthesis, close to what Kitchenham calls a line of reasoning synthesis, as this study tries to deduce as much as possible. It should be noted that the numbers presented in Figure 2 are only the basis for answering the questions. While the number of journals found in the figure is high, we must take care that the numbers presented in Figure 2 also form the basis for answering the questions."}, {"heading": "4.1.1. (RQ-1) What decision support systems for fisheries and aquaculture exists?", "text": "The results of this mapping are presented in Table 1.Table 1 and show that DSS research is more focused on fisheries than aquaculture, although both areas are well anchored in research and case studies. Except for SID-14, all systems identified in the study are focused on either fisheries or aquaculture, and the general trend suggests that they should be managed as two distinct classes. Another classification using the type of DSS described in the papers has been performed and is shown in Figure 2. Column 1 of Table 2 shows the classification of DSS within fisheries, while Column 2 shows the same classification for aquaculture."}, {"heading": "4.1.2. (RQ-2) What are the most investigated fishery and aquaculture DSS topics and how have these changed over time.", "text": "In addition to classifying the results on the basis of their nature, as shown in Table 2, the papers were also classified in terms of their problem areas; the results of this classification are presented in Table 3, which shows which papers fit which topic, and in Figure B, which shows how the popularity of the various topics has changed over time. It should be noted that the individual papers can be found in Table 3 and in the table in Annex B.Decision support systems for fisheries and aquaculture. [15], and resolving all the parameters that influence decisions that can be assigned in the real world is difficult. This study shows that most of the systems they support for fisheries and aquaculture are very complex."}, {"heading": "4.1.3. (RQ-3) Does there exist any DSSs for fisheries providing real-time analytics?", "text": "Given the small amount of related work found during the search phase, we found only one work (SID-19) that met the requirements for full real-time DSS fishing, while SID-16, 17 and 23 included real-time components. We identified sustainability as an important issue in RQ-2, reflecting the growing problem of global overfishing. Accordingly, management decisions should take into account sustainable fisheries and water pollution in their decision-making process. To this end, Caddy and Mahon [16] outline reference points for fisheries management that provide quantitative indicators for system objectives. It states that the development of reference points for decision-making should be underpinned not only by historical data, but also in real-time data to maximize their goal. Therefore, facilitating the use of real-time data is important for fishermen and aquaculture DSS that include fisheries regulations or sustainability. Despite the limited research on this topic, SI19 shows that DSS data is already possible, and even if in a limited area, real-time analyses have been done."}, {"heading": "4.1.4. (RQ-4) Do DSSes in Fisheries and Aquaculture build their models using machine learning done on captured and grounded data?", "text": "An important quality for a DSS is how well it maps the actual situation of the decision problem, a quality that may be threatened by the use of outdated models or outdated input data (e.g. simulation or model parameters). In Table 4, we have summarized the use of machine learning and the data on which machine learning has been trained. In this context, we define machine learning as the creation of phenomenon models (e.g. for predictions such as in SID-17) automatically based on data, in contrast to more static AI methods such as rule-based expert systems (see, for example, the Hargrave traffic light system in SID-15), which is not considered as machine learning.Table 4 shows that there are only 6 publications that use any type of machine learning as part of their main contributor.Deeper in aquaculture, only 1 study (8.33%) uses machine learning.In comparison, Fisheries has 5 publications (1.5% of its main task), 3% of which are machine learning."}, {"heading": "5. Discussion", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "5.1. Threats to validity", "text": "The primary threats to this study are whether our approach adequately addresses the most important research questions. Research questions require an evaluation of the selected data sources to determine whether we have identified all relevant publications and whether our original classification of the problem domain is designated correctly for analysis. As there was no prior systematic mapping study of the search terms, some terms or synonyms may be missing, causing some publications to be missing from the list of results. The first threat is influenced by our search criteria, the scope of the search and the search terms used, which in turn are limited by the search engine's capacity. Our primary method of avoiding these pitfalls was to employ our external reviewers to perform a random test on the search queries, the problem domain, etc. for finding papers that we did not find in our systematic mapping study. The third party did not find any significant essays that were missing from this study; therefore, we argue that we have managed to present relevant questions for publication in documents that are relevant to time literature."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The results of our systematic mapping study have implications for those who wish to design a multi-criterion decision support system for fisheries and aquaculture. Our results show that the majority of work evaluating and documenting their methodology has done so with few criteria in mind. Systematic mapping has shown that very little research has been done on DSS in fisheries and that there is a lack of empirical evaluation of these systems. Another concern raised in the study indicates that there are few to no well-documented multi-criterion DSS systems for both fisheries and aquaculture. However, the analysis has shown that many components for smaller DSS systems are well-documented and that the outcome of this study can serve as a basis for further research and development, particularly in conjunction with previous research and knowledge on the management of heterogeneous data systems."}, {"heading": "7.
