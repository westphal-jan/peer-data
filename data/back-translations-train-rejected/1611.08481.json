GuessWhat?! game", "text": "A player - the oracle - is randomly assigned to an object (which could be a person) in the scene. This object is not known to the other player - the questioner - whose goal is to locate the hidden object. To do this, the questioner can ask a series of yes / no questions, which are answered by the oracle, as in Figures 1 and 2. Note that the questioner is not aware of the list of objects, they can only see the entire picture. Once the questioner has gathered enough evidence to locate the object, they notify the oracle that they are ready to guess the object."}, {"heading": "3.

Data collection", "text": "Images We use a subset of training and validation images and objects from the MS COCO dataset [26]. First, we discard objects that are too small (range < 500px2) to be properly located by a human observer. Then, we only retain images with three to twenty objects to avoid trivial or excessively complicated images. In total, we hold 77,973 images with 609,543 objects. We verified that this selection does not significantly alter the original dataset distribution. Amazon Mechanical Turk The data collection was related to Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). [9] We created two separate tasks - known as HITs on AMT - for the questioners and oracle roles, and rewarded the questioners slightly more than the oracle. We ensured the quality of the data collection by multiple means. First, the workers had to complete a qualification round consisting of successfully completed ten games while making less than 4 errors or connections."}, {"heading": "4.2.

The GuessWhat?! data set will be released on January 28, 20171."}, {"heading": "5. Baselines", "text": "We now empirically examine the difficulty of the oracle and questioner tasks by training reasonable basic lines for each task and measuring their effectiveness. Formally, a GuessWhat?! game revolves around an image that contains a series of K-segmented objects (O1,.., OK). Each object Ok is given an object category (ck) {1,..., C} and has a pixel-by-pixel segmentation mask (Sk, 0, 1} M \u00b7 N) to indicate its position and size. Furthermore, the game consists of a sequence of questions and answers D = {q1, a1,..., qJ, aJ} generated by the questioner and oracle. We use q < j and a < j to refer to the first j \u2212 1 questions and answers. Each question qj contains a sequence of Nj tokens, i.e. qj = {wj1,"}, {"heading": "5.1.

Discussion", "text": "We have introduced the GuessWhat?! game, a novel framework for multimodal dialogue. To the best of our knowledge, we are presenting the first large dataset with images and dialogues. A wide range of challenges could arise from this association, as it relies on various fields of machine learning, such as understanding natural languages, generative models or computer vision. GuessWhat?! proves to be an exciting game that significantly reduces the cost of collecting a large dataset required for modern algorithms. As a second contribution, we have introduced three tasks based on the questioner and the oracle role. In any case, we have prototyped a neural architecture as the first starting point. We analysed these results and presented a quantitative description of the GuessWhat?! dataset. We believe GuessWhat?! could enable a myriad of other applications that are either based on the game itself or expand the database to perform other tasks."}, {"heading": "A.
