Introduction", "text": "The competitive game attracts not only professional players, but also many spectators who are interested in the game. The tournament is a competitive system. It offers some prizes as an objective for participants to compete with each other. It is often used as a formal method to hold official gaming events, to gather professional players, and to attract a large number of spectators. Such major events usually receive sponsorship from various companies and organizations. Therefore, it is necessary to be carefully prepared and conducted in order to avoid disappointment on each side. There are three main concerns in tournament systems: 1. Implementation costs (CC), that is, the number of games required to perform. Second, the development of competitiveness (CD). That is, to minimize the disposable games in which participants are not so motivated to play their best. In terms of competitive gaming, some research finds that unequal teams tend to attract less interest from spectators."}, {"heading": "2 Analyzing Method", "text": "This section presents two important aspects for the analysis of the quality of tournament structures: development of competitiveness and precision of ranking."}, {"heading": "2.1 Competitiveness Development", "text": "The motivation of a participant consists of many factors, but we limit ourselves to the tournament structure in this study. We introduce \"progress tree\" to demonstrate the perspective of participants in a tournament, to analyze their motivation development during the tournament. The progress tree is constructed on the basis of the graphical model approach [4]. The state of a participant before or after playing a game is considered a node. The state in which the participant no longer plays a game is a leaf node. We show, in Figure 1, an example of a single elimination tournament for 8 participants, and Figure 2 shows his or her progress. While \"competitive\" means that participants must compete with each other, it is common to have more than one prize rather than goals in a tournament. Therefore, it is necessary to have the prizes comparable in an order."}, {"heading": "2.2 Ranking Precision", "text": "We see the tournament as a comparison / sorting problem, and each game is a comparison between two players. We assume that there is a game in which a stronger player always wins against a weaker player, and we have all participants with different strengths. There are two ways to check the ranking of such a game: by mathematical evidence or by using all possibilities. In this essay, we simply use the permutation to try out all the possible outcomes, then we can see whether the results are accurate or not. However, the method of the permutation experiment is too difficult if the number of participants is too large, so in this essay we are conducting experiments with only eight participants."}, {"heading": "3 Tournament Structure Analysis", "text": "We analyze various general tournament systems such as singles, doubles and round robin.

These players are divided into 8 slots as shown in Figure 1. Table 2 shows the expected exact ranking of the tournament, while Table 3 shows the actual results, counting all 8! = 40320 variations.Of all the leaderboard results, 1st place is the only 100% correct. This suggests that a single exclusion only provides a convincing ranking result for the first place, further rankings could be criticized as inaccurate."}, {"heading": "3.2 Double Elimination", "text": "In a standard double elimination tournament, participants are divided into two subordinate brackets (upper and lower brackets). If a participant from the lower bracket loses a game, the participant is eliminated. If a participant from the lower bracket loses, the participant is moved into the lower bracket. The last remaining participant in the lower bracket is the last participant standing as a grand finale in the upper bracket. This means that there are two rounds in the lower bracket for each round in the upper bracket before the grand final.Table 3: Ranking of the individual elimination for 8 participants Experimental participants 1st place 2nd place 3-4 Place 5-8th place"}, {"heading": "1 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 40320 (100%)", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 5760 (14%) 34560 (86%)", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 11520 (29%) 28800 (71%)", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4 0 (0%) 1152 (3%) 16128 (40%) 23040 (57%)", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5 0 (0%) 4608 (11%) 18432 (46%) 17280 (43%)", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6 0 (0%) 11520 (29%) 17280 (43%) 11520 (29%)", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7 0 (0%) 23040 (57%) 11520 (29%) 5760 (14%)", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "8 40320 (100%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%)", "text": "Figure 3: Double elimination tournament for 8 participants"}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Conduction Cost", "text": "A purely double elimination system with i upper rounds has 2i participants, and (2i \u2212 1) + (2i \u2212 1 \u2212 1) games are played.

Even with an increased number of games being played compared to the individual elimination, it still lacks accuracy in ranking. However, the double elimination has two starting nodes (see Figure 4). It can be argued that the double elimination is designed for a multi-tier system, or players are correctly distributed using a scoring system [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Therefore, stronger participants and weaker participants (seeded) are expected to be properly distributed in the upper and lower brackets."}, {"heading": "3.3 Round-Robin", "text": "In the round-robin tournament system, all participants must play against each other.

The big difference to elimination tournaments is that from the beginning only the hand of all losses and the hand of all wins is known. Due to this unstable situation, we are not able to calculate stability values of the nodes. As the tournament progresses, the unknown hands will gradually reveal themselves and the stability values of the nodes would be calculated. Furthermore, unstable situations indicate that there are possibilities not to satisfy the progression of stability and the possibility of result conditions.In Table 7, we show an example situation after 5 rounds, and Figure 6 shows its progress tree. In this situation, if participant A wins the next game, his victory would be determined first regardless of his last score. This does not satisfy the progression of stability. In addition, for participants B, F, E, G, R and P even their hands are unknown, so the possibility of 1st place is not within reach."}, {"heading": "3.3.3 Ranking Precision", "text": "Suppose we have 8 participants with strengths varying from 1 to 8, and stronger participants always win.

However, implementation costs are high and competitiveness development is not good."}, {"heading": "4 Results and Evaluation", "text": "We show in Table 9 the comparison between single elimination, double elimination and robins. We see that higher management costs are needed to achieve a better ranking accuracy, the result shows that the single elimination system has the lowest costs, while its development of competitiveness is properly maintained. However, its ranking is reliable only for the top 4 winners. Double elimination also has no problem in developing competitiveness. Although it has higher management costs with a proper sowing system, its ranking is accurate for the top 4 winners. Robins, on the other hand, gives a precise ranking to all participants, but can cause excessive costs, which causes the lack of development of competitiveness."}, {"heading": "5 Concluding Remarks", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a novel method of analyzing tournament structures in order to find the most suitable one for the tournament under consideration. We focused on three aspects, such as the cost of organizing tournaments, developing competitiveness and ranking precision. We proposed a progress tree to identify potential disposable games. The analysis performed with the proposed method reveals the strengths and weaknesses of tournament structures. In conclusion, a one-time elimination is best when we want to qualify only one winner, all games performed are exciting in terms of competitiveness. Double elimination with the right seeding system is a better choice if we want to qualify more winners. An appropriate number of additional matches must be performed in exchange for being able to qualify the top four winners. Round-Robin provides all participants with reliable ranking precision, but its execution costs are very high and it does not succeed in maintaining competitiveness development."}], "references": [{"title": "Thinking about competitive balance,", "author": ["A.R.
