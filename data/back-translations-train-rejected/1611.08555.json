New theories, techniques, algorithms have been rapidly developed. One of the most striking trends in the neutrosophic theory is the hybridization of neutrosophic set with other potential sets such as rough set, bipolar set, soft set, hesitant fuzzy set, etc. The different hybrid structure such as rough neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic rough set, bipolar neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, etc. are proposed in the literature in a short period of time. Neutrosophic set has been a very important tool in all various areas of data mining, decision making, e-learning, engineering, medicine, social science, and some more. The book New Trends in Neutrosophic Theories and Applications focuses on theories, methods, algorithms for decision making and also applications involving neutrosophic information. Some topics deal with data mining, decision making, e-learning, graph theory, medical diagnosis, probability theory, topology, and some more.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 19:16:49 GMT  (4890kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08555v1", "424 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "424 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["florentin smarandache", "surapati pramanik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08555"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.08555.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Florentin Smarandache", "Surapati Pramanik", "Georgiana Antonescu", "George Lukacs", "ISBN", "Paul P.

This approach gives a presentation of data analysis common to all applications. Data mining depends on two main elements, namely the concept of similarity and the machine learning framework. It describes a lot of real world applications for the domains namely mathematical, medical, educational, chemical, multimedia etc. There are two main types of indeterminacy in supervised learning: cognitive and statistical. Statistical indeterminacy deals with the random behavior of nature. All existing data mining techniques can handle the uncertainty that arises (or is assumed to arise) in the natural world from statistical variations or randomness. Cognitive uncertainty deals with human cognition. In real world problems for data mining, indeterminacy components may arise. Neutrosophic logic can handle this situation. In this paper, we have shown the role of single valued neutrosophic set logic in data mining. We also propose a data mining approach in single valued neutrosophic environment.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2016"}}}
