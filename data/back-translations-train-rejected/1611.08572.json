In the first step, arguments for a particular topic are identified in a given text and offensive and supportive relationships are established between the proposals. The result is an argumentation graph. In the future, we hope to use argumentation techniques to automate this step. At this point, this is done manually by adding some texts.2. Initial plausibility assessment. The proposals (presented as nodes of the argumentation graph) are assigned an initial plausibility based on web search engines. 3. acceptability level of the reasoning calculation is calculated.

Specifically, G is a square matrix of order n whose elements are either \u2212 1, 0 or 1.
