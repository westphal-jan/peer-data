They embed dynamic procedures to make simple models efficient [2]. Conversely, although CP is a declarative technology, CP users require considerable expertise to adequately model their problems. This expertise is required to select any MILP engine and formulate a search strategy that is the main component of the modeling phase. This could be the broader take-up of CP. In this paper, we present MICE, a simple API to solve CP models called from Java. Our goal is not to design a winner between classic, propagation-based CP solutions and MILP engines.
