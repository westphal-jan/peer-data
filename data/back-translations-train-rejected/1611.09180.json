Traditionally, the repeat sales model has been widely adopted to estimate real estate price. However, it depends the design and calculation of a complex economic related index, which is challenging to estimate accurately. Today, real estate brokers provide easy access to detailed online information on real estate properties to their clients. We are interested in estimating the real estate price from these large amounts of easily accessed data. In particular, we analyze the prediction power of online house pictures, which is one of the key factors for online users to make a potential visiting decision. The development of robust computer vision algorithms makes the analysis of visual content possible. In this work, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict real estate price using the state-of-the-art visual features. The experimental results indicate that our model outperforms several of other state-of-the-art baseline algorithms in terms of both mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 15:23:14 GMT  (4384kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09180v1", "8 pages, 8 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:18:27 GMT  (6483kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09180v2", "8 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["quanzeng you", "ran pang", "liangliang cao", "jiebo luo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.09180"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.09180.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Image Based Appraisal of Real Estate Properties", "authors": ["Quanzeng You", "Ran Pang"], "emails": ["jluo@cs.rochester.edu}."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most people are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "They used regression analyses to compile the price index, which shows good performance. Another widely used regression model, the Hedonic regression, is developed on the assumption that a house's characteristics can predict its price [6], [7]. However, it is argued that the Hedonic regression model requires more assumptions regarding the explanation of its goal [26]. They also mentioned that the main problem is that the repeat sales are the lack of data that can lead to the failure of the model. Recent work at [8] busy locations and sales price series to build an authoregressive component. Their model is able to use both individual sales houses and resale houses, which can offer a more robust selling price."}, {"heading": "III.

Recurrent Neural Network", "text": "With a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) we try to predict the output sequence q q = 36. Between the input layer and the output layer there is a hidden layer, which is normally estimated in Equation (3). One of the most common architectures is the Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) cell [34], which can overcome the disappearing and exploding gradient problem [35] by training RNN with gradient descent.

Multi-layer Bidirectional LSTM", "text": "In previous sections, we discussed the generation of sequences as well as the recurrent neural networks, which relate to the same motivation as the recurrent neural networks. We remember that we have built an undirected graph in the generation of sequences indicating that the price of a house is the same as the price of a house in the same amount as the price of a house in the same amount as the price of a house in the same amount as the price of a house in the same amount as the price of a house."}, {"heading": "D. Prediction", "text": "In the prediction phase, the first step is also the generation of sequences. For each test house, we insert them as a new node in our previously created similarity diagram on the training data. Each test house is a new node in the diagram. Next, we insert the test node and the training node edges. We use the same settings when we add edges to the new neighborhood diagram. Considering the new G \u2032 diagram, we randomly create sequences and keep these sequences that contain one and only one test node. In this way, we are able to generate many different sequences for each house that contain this house. Fig. 4 shows the idea. Each test sequence has only one test house. The remaining nodes in the sequence are the known training houses. a) Average: The above strategy implies that we are able to build many different sequences for each test house. In order to calculate the final sequences, each pre-price for each test house consists of a simple strategy to calculate the average price for each test house."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "This paper collects all the data from Realtor (http: / / www.realtor.com /), the largest brokerage association in North America. We collect data from San Jose, CA, one of the most active cities in the US, and Rochester, NY, one of the least active cities in the US, over a one-year period. In the next section, we will discuss the details of how the data can be pre-processed for further experiments."}, {"heading": "A. Data Preparation", "text": "The data collected by Realtor includes descriptions, school information and possible images of each property, as shown in Fig. 1. We are particularly interested in using the images of each house to perform the price estimation. We filter out these houses without an image in our data set. Since houses in the same neighborhood appear to have a similar price, location is another important feature in our data set. However, after inspecting the data, we find that some of the house prices are abnormal. Jose we process the data by filtering out houses with extremely high or low prices compared to their neighborhood.TABLE I shows the overall statistics of our data set after filtering. Overall, the city of San Jose shows more houses on the market than Rochester (as expected for one of the hottest markets in the country). House prices in the two cities also exhibit significant differences. Figure shows some of the sample house images from the two cities."}, {"heading": "B. Feature Extraction and Baseline Algorithms", "text": "Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision tasks [17], [41]. In fact, features based on pre-formed deep CNN models have been applied to other vision tasks, including image style recognition [42] and semantic segmentation [43]. In our implementation, we experimented with the GoogleNet model [41], which is one of the most advanced deep neural architectures. Specifically, we use the response of the last avg pooling layer as visual features for each image. In this way, we get a 1,024-dimensional feature vector for each image. Each house can have several different images from different angles of the same property. We use average features of all images of the same house (also known as average pooling) to obtain the house's feature representation."}, {"heading": "C. Training a Multi-layer B-LSTM Model", "text": "With the similarity diagram mentioned above, we are able to generate sequences based on random walks according to the steps described in Algorithm 1. For each city, we randomly divide the houses into training (80%) and test set (20%). Next, we create sequences based on random walks in the training houses, just to create our training sequences for multi-layered B-LSTM. For both cities, we randomly create 200,000 sequences for training, with a length of 10. Likewise, we create test sequences in which each sequence contains one and only one test house (see Figure 4). On average, we generate 100 sequences for each test house. The B-LSTM model is formed with a batch size of 1024. In our experiment settings, we set the size of the first hidden layer to 400 and the size of the second hidden layer to 200.The absolute error metrics used are the absolute MAverage (APE) and mean error metrics."}, {"heading": "D. Confidence Level", "text": "We want to know if the proposed model can distinguish the confidence level of its forecast or not. In particular, we group the test houses evenly into three groups for each city. The first group shows the smallest standard deviation of the forecast prices, the second group is the middle group and the last group is the one with the largest standard deviation. Fig.8 shows the MAE and MAPE for the different groups. Results show that standard deviation can be considered as a rough measure of the confidence level of the proposed model on the current test house. Small standard deviations tend to indicate a high confidence level of the model, and overall it also indicates a smaller prediction error."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for property valuation, in particular, the proposed framework is capable of taking into account both location and visual attributes. Assessment of the proposed model in two selected cities indicates the effectiveness and flexibility of the model. Indeed, our work has also offered new approaches to applying deep neural networks to structured graphical data. We hope that our model will not only provide insights into property valuation, but also inspire others to apply deep neural networks to structured graphical data."}], "references": [{"title": "Exploiting geographic dependencies for real estate appraisal: a mutual perspective of ranking and clustering", "author": ["Y.

Traditionally, the repeat sales model has been widely adopted to estimate real estate price. However, it depends the design and calculation of a complex economic related index, which is challenging to estimate accurately. Today, real estate brokers provide easy access to detailed online information on real estate properties to their clients. We are interested in estimating the real estate price from these large amounts of easily accessed data. In particular, we analyze the prediction power of online house pictures, which is one of the key factors for online users to make a potential visiting decision. The development of robust computer vision algorithms makes the analysis of visual content possible. In this work, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict real estate price using the state-of-the-art visual features. The experimental results indicate that our model outperforms several of other state-of-the-art baseline algorithms in terms of both mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
