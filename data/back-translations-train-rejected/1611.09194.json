We derive a new algorithm based on a probabilistic interpretation of kernel alignment matrices. This algorithm expressesthe averaging process in terms of a stochastic alignment automata. It uses an iterative agglomerative heuristic method for averagingthe aligned samples, while also averaging the times of occurrence of the aligned samples. By comparing classification accuracies for45 heterogeneous time series datasets obtained by first nearest centroid/medoid classifiers we show that: i) centroid-basedapproaches significantly outperform medoid-based approaches, ii) for the considered datasets, our algorithm that combines averagingin the sample space and along the time axes, emerges as the most significantly robust model for time-elastic averaging with apromising noise reduction capability. We also demonstrate its benefit in an isolated gesture recognition experiment and its ability tosignificantly reduce the size of training instance sets. Finally we highlight its denoising capability using demonstrative synthetic data:we show that it is possible to retrieve, from few noisy instances, a signal whose components are scattered in a wide spectral band.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 15:34:30 GMT  (3633kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09194v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 12:41:07 GMT  (3751kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09194v2", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.06897. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.06897"], ["v3", "Thu, 22 Dec 2016 11:50:08 GMT  (3750kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09194v3", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.06897"], ["v4", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 08:40:10 GMT  (3710kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09194v4", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.06897"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["pierre-fran\\c{c}ois marteau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.09194"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.09194.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Times series averaging and denoising from a probabilistic perspective on time-elastic kernels", "authors": ["Pierre-Francois Marteau"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index terms - time series averaging the elastic core of time.F Dynamic time distortion Hidden Markov model classification Denoising.F"}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "Since Maurice Fre'chet's pioneering work [1] in the early 1900s, temporal allocation of time series or symbolic sequences, has received much attention from the scientific community in numerous areas such as indexing of information and retrieval, pattern analysis, data collection, etc., this is a very wide range of applications such as the environment, industry, energy, defence, etc. Among other temporal measures, the dynamics of the time were spread in the 1970s."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORKS", "text": "The averaging of time series in the context of (multiple) time-elastic distance adjustments was mainly dealt with in the context of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) measurement [2], [3].

A popular approach is to provide a random sequence for the leaves and then construct the binary tree using this sequence to the root [11].Another approach involves constructing a dendrogram (a hierarchical ascendant grouping) from the dataset and then using this dendrogram to calculate pair-wise centering, starting with the narrowest of progressive series, as shown in pairs of time series 1 and 1."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Iterative heuristics", "text": "Iterative heuristics are based on an iterated three-step process.

time elastic centroid for a set of time series. We derive a new algorithm based on a probabilistic interpretation of kernel alignment matrices. This algorithm expresses the averaging process in terms of a stochastic alignment automata. It uses an iterative agglomerative heuristic method for averaging the aligned samples, while also averaging the times of occurrence of the aligned samples. By comparing classification accuracies for 45 heterogeneous time series datasets obtained by first nearest centroid/medoid classifiers we show that: i) centroid-based approaches significantly outperform medoid-based approaches, ii) for the considered datasets, our algorithm that combines averaging in the sample space and along the time axes, emerges as the most significantly robust model for time-elastic averaging with a promising noise reduction capability. We also demonstrate its benefit in an isolated gesture recognition experiment and its ability to significantly reduce the size of training instance sets. Finally we highlight its denoising capability using demonstrative synthetic data: we show that it is possible to retrieve, from few noisy instances, a signal whose components are scattered in a wide spectral band.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
