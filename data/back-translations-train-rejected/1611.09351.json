The setup requires that both FE and TOF have their own space SFE, or STOF of the propositions, and that both maintain a state of belief formalized as the probability function PFE or PTOF of the respective proposition spaces.

However, from the perspective of formalizing the underlying logic, it is a completely insignificant question, and this observation applies to the case of forensic reasoning.
