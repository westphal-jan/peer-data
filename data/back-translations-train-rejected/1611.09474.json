Submodular functions appear in various contexts, such as machine learning tasks, sensor placement problems, sections is graphics, plant location and sentence coverage issues [Nemhauser et al., 1978]. The inherent feature behind all these problems is that they all have a decreasing return property. In addition, the decreasing return property may occur in applications where we do not make a binary decision on a number of elements. For example, we look for a specific budget among media channels (such as TV, newspapers, websites, etc.) in order to maximize the impact on a number of potential customers."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In contrast to the problem of minimizing submodular functions (comparable to convex minimization), which can be performed efficiently [Schrijver, 2000; Iwata et al., 2001], the maximization of submodular functions is NPhard, since it includes the well-known NP complete Max Cut problem. Classical work by Nemhauser et al. [1978] showed that the greedy algorithm has an approximation ratio of 1 \u2212 1e for maximizing a monotonous, submodular function under a cardinality constraint."}, {"heading": "3 Problem Statement and Preliminaries", "text": "Definition 1. A defined function f: 2N \u2192 R with a base set N is submodular if: f (X) + f (Y) \u2265 f (X-Y) + f (X-Y) for all sets X, Y'N. An equivalent definition of submodular (set) functions results from the decreasing property of return as follows: f (X-Y) \u2212 f (X-Y) \u2265 f (Y-Y {u}) \u2212 f (Y) for each X-Y'N, u-N, u-Xu and u 6. This decreasing property of return can be generalized to functions defined by the integer grid. Definition 2. A function f: ZN + \u2192 R defined by the integer grid is considered DR-submodular if: f (x + Xu) \u2212 f (x) \u2212 f (y) \u2212 f (y), for x-y (both in ZN + N) \u2212"}, {"heading": "4 Continuous Double-Greedy Algorithm", "text": "In this section we present our first polynomial time algorithm, which deals with both versions of the cardinality constraint (inequality and equality). Before going to the algorithm, we must introduce a new extension of the DR-submodular functions into the unit Hypercube. This extension is determined by the elements of the vector x (Buchbinder et al., 2014). In the multilinear extension, I can take all integers from 0 to Bi, we use the binomial distribution, whose parameters are determined by vectors B and x. We also add a third vector m, which is the deterministic unit of each coordinate. This helps us to find the derivation of our extended function, which is performed in problem 1."}, {"heading": "5 Random Greedy Algorithm", "text": "In this section, we look at the other version of the cardinalism limitation with an inequality. (First of all, we want to solve this problem: \"It is not that we choose exactly k elements and any solution is feasible as long as it does not go beyond k elements.\" (3) The difference between this problem and the problem (1) is that we do not insist on choosing exactly k elements and finding a constant solution as long as it does not go beyond k elements. (3) Algorithms 2 and 3 are also able to handle this kind of coercion (see line 10 in Algorithm 1), but the algorithms in this section offer (in expectation) a constant factor. (3) Algorithms 2 and 3 of algorithms 3 are not in expectation. (3) Algorithms 2 and 3 are not in expectation."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "Since this is a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for this problem, there are no other algorithms in the literature to compare with others. So, we compare our proposed algorithms with the pseudo-polynomial time algorithms that we can apply by extending the experiments to a multiset and then maximizing the available algorithms for submodular (set function). The algorithms are implemented in MATLAB [2015] so that both algorithms can be applicable. \u2022 We extend the principles to an Intel R \u00a9 Core i7 3.1GHz processor with 8GB of RAM. The algorithms are implemented in MATLAB [2015]. We compare the following algorithms: \u2022 Continuous Double Greedy (DG): We expand the principles N to a multiset the size of B, then we run Algorithms 2 by Buchbinder et al. [2014] This gives us a pseudo-polynomial time algorithmic time algorithm."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed two polynomial time-fit algorithms for non-monotonous DR-submodular function maximization under a cardinality constraint: one has an approximation ratio that depends on k (on the cardinality constraint), and the other algorithm has a constant approximation ratio (in expectation). We have demonstrated the efficiency of our algorithms through an application in revenue maximization. In terms of quantity functions, minimizing supermodular functions is more difficult than maximizing submodular functions, although both are NP-hard. In fact, Kelner and Nikolova [2007] showed that supermodular minimization (log n) -difficult to approximate. Later, Mittal and Schulz [2013] showed that supermodular minimization within any constant factor is difficult to approximate. If the supermodular function has a limited curvature, Il'ev and Srivivial have defined a function (the function proposed in 2001; we have the algorithm in 2015)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work was partially supported by NSF grant numbers CCF1216103, CCF-1350823, CCF-1331863 and a Google Faculty Research Award."}], "references": [{"title": "Pipage rounding: A new method of constructing algorithms with proven performance guarantee", "author": ["Alexander A Ageev", "Maxim I Sviridenko"], "venue": "Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, 8(3):307\u2013328,", "citeRegEx": "Ageev and Sviridenko. 2004", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2004}, {"title": "In Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web", "author": ["Noga Alon", "Iftah Gamzu", "Moshe Tennenholtz.
