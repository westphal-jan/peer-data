An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem. Therefore, patents often have a high concentration of scientific and technical terms that are rare in everyday language. The Chinese word segmentation model, which is trained on currently available everyday language records, performs poorly because it cannot effectively detect these scientific and technical terms.
