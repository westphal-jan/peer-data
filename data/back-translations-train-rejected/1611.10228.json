We implement a vanilla model in which we train SVM models based on behavioural traits based on the psychological traits underlying the competitive model. We show that this fundamental model captures the 14 selection distortions and outperforms all other learning-based models in competition. Preliminary results suggest that such hybrid models can significantly improve the prediction of human decision-making and provide a promising direction for future research."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "2 The Hybrid Model", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Feature representation", "text": "Each sample that reflects a problem p is given by 10 parameters: LA, HA, pHA, LB, HB, pHB, LotNum, LotShape, Corr, Amb (the first 10 coordinates of problem space PS).

First, we create a problem beep by converting p's probabilities - pHa and pHb - to their effective form at block i.

Conducting large-scale experiments with online labor markets is becoming increasingly popular with Amazon's growing online workforce."}], "references": [{"title": "Support-vector networks", "author": ["C.
