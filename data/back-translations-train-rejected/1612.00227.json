On the other hand, text based tasks for event recognition, as for example event coreference (i.e. recognizing whether two textual descriptions refer to the same event), do not take into account ontological information of the extracted events in their process. In this paper, we propose a method to derive event coreference on text extracted event data using semantic based rule reasoning. We demonstrate our method considering a limited (yet representative) set of event types: we introduce a formal analysis on their ontological properties and, on the base of this, we define a set of coreference criteria. We then implement these criteria as RDF-based reasoning rules to be applied on text extracted event data. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over a standard coreference benchmark dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 12:58:02 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00227v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["stefano borgo", "loris bozzato", "alessio palmero aprosio", "marco rospocher", "luciano serafini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00227"}, "pdf": {"name": "1612.00227.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On Coreferring Text-extracted Event Descriptions with the aid of Ontological Reasoning", "authors": ["Stefano Borgo", "Loris Bozzato", "Alessio Palmero Aprosio", "Marco Rospocher", "Luciano Serafini"], "emails": ["stefano.borgo@cnr.it,", "bozzato@fbk.eu", "aprosio@fbk.eu", "rospocher@fbk.eu", "serafini@fbk.eu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: event co-reference; semantic information extraction; event formalization"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to be able to look for a solution that will put us in the position in which we are able to find a solution."}, {"heading": "2 Events and Event descriptions", "text": "We begin with a formal ontological definition of the event, adapted to the approach pursued in DOLCE [4]: An event is an event, that is, a unit that is directly related to time and (indirectly) relates to space through its participants. We simplify this view slightly by rephrasing the term as follows: An event identifies a spatio-temporal region, some relevant units in it, and what happens to those units. As usual, we divide the events into types depending on the changes that happen to the participants during the time span of the event. Formally, we characterize events based on four characteristics that we consider ontologically necessary for an event: 1. Event type (i.e. the nature of the event) 2. Participants with their thematic role within the event (i.e. their relevance within the event) 3. Time of the event (i.e. the time of the event) 4. Localization of the global event for time and place we can agree on a certain granularity."}, {"heading": "2.1 Formal analysis of event types", "text": "On this basis, we can refine the four characteristics by characterizing the types of events according to the following points: Ontological Classification: Classification of the type of event in terms of the DOLCE definition of events (i.e. achievements or achievements) [4].

Tool Participants: Participants considered instruments in the event. Subevents and Sovra events: Types of events (possibly or necessarily) included in the event under consideration.

A total of 1744 event mentions are commented on, corresponding to 339 distinction events. We decided to work on this corpus because it offers a small but relevant set of event types. We selected 6 of the more representative event types in the collection (namely: Arresting, Killing, Dying, Charging, Shooting, Attacking) and applied our formal analysis to them. We note that these types of events are closely linked and can give rise to interesting reference examples. Full results of the analysis of such event types are provided in Appendix A.

In other words, the features of e1 and e2 identify different classifications (perspectives) of the same event or the feature set of e1 (e2) identify a part of the event identified by e2 (e2 or ly). Note that even if event references exist between two events e1 and e2, these events may still differ in terms of information content. If, for example, it is an Olympic race, e1 may have information about the weather during the race that may not be available in case e2. In fact, for an event reference to be fulfilled, it is sufficient that both have the same information about the event (a type of race) that consists of the time and the event related to the task."}, {"heading": "5.2 Coreference measure and aggregation", "text": "We can formally define a coreference measure and a relationship to aggregated event descriptions as follows: We call a coreference measure for event type t any function that assigns a value in [0, 1] to each pair of event descriptions ed1, ed2 of type t. Intuitively, a coreference measure provides an estimate of plausibility for two event descriptions that relate to the same event. A coreference aggregation \u03b1t for event type t is a function that, for two event descriptions, ed1, ed2 of type t, provides a new common event description ed1 + 2. A coreference aggregation provides a way to merge two event descriptions into a single event description that aggregates all the information contained in the initial event descriptions."}, {"heading": "5.3 Implementing coreference conditions rules", "text": "In our approach, rules for co-reference measurement and aggregation are formulated based on the ontological definition of events. In our initial formulation of the co-reference rules, we considered only the conditions for co-reference measurement: that is, in our experiments we are not interested in aggregating event descriptions, but we recognize and mark them only as (possibly) co-reference rings. As the first formulation for co-reference measurement, we simply provided rules for specific and possible co-references: the first conditions correspond to sufficient and necessary conditions (for each event type) for co-ference existence, while the latter represent only necessary conditions that provide evidence for the possible existence of co-references. Such conditions have been extracted from the ontological analysis of the event type under consideration: in other words, these co-reference criteria correspond to the necessary (and sometimes sufficient) event criteria arising from this analysis. In the formulation of the rules, we consider the availability of frametic elements to be defined as the node points in the ontological framework analysis."}, {"heading": "6 Evaluation on ECB benchmark", "text": "The dataset is a collection of 482 text documents from Google News, divided into 43 sentences representing different topics. For each topic, the text set is commented with intra- and cross-document event references in accordance with the TimeML specification. In the literature, there are various ways to evaluate event references, each of which has different characteristics: e.g. MUC [23], B3 [1], CEAF [14] and BLANC [15]. BLANC in particular was developed to overcome the limitations of the other previously proposed metrics, taking into account both Korean and non-Korean links, not ignoring singletons (problematic for MUC) and not increasing the score in their presence (as is typically the case with B3 and CEAF values).To calculate these metrics, we rely on most available reference instruments http: /: http: / www.corbation.eu18."}, {"heading": "6.1 Experiments setup", "text": "Unfortunately, not every event in the ECB's corpus is annotated in the document, so we choose to include in our classification only those words that actually comment in the gold standard.Since we are currently dealing with the most common 6 event types, we filter out the lexical units that do not appear in the corresponding frames in the FrameNet. In particular, our rating is limited to 137 different lexical units. We are developing a terminal-based baseline that can be compared with the results of our system: All predicates in the FrameNet that have the same problem are coreferential.We have piked the ECB's corpus, obtaining a knowledge diagram of the RDF about events, entities, locations, etc., which is transmitted by the news documents in the corpus. Subsequently, we applied the rules that express the core determination conditions on this RDF knowledge chart. The rules were expressed as SPL-based information in the Corpus, the additional QARL-based rules were implemented in the Corpus, or the Rules were implemented in the Corpus."}, {"heading": "6.2 Experiments results", "text": "The results of our experiments are presented in Table 3. In addition to the baseline, we report on the performance in applying possible and certain event correlation rules separately and in total. In total, 152 possible event correlation pairs and 275 specific event correlation pairs were generated. On BLANC, our approach significantly exceeds the Lemma baseline (approximately 27% difference on F1, taking into account both probable and certain co-references). In all metrics, our work consistently shows better precision correlation values than on the baseline, while the opposite applies to the callback. The good performance in terms of precision should not be surprising, as our rules are only applied when several conditions of the event description are met, and also when applying events of the same type are applied, but with different lemmata. On the contrary, the low performance in the callback, especially compared to the baseline, are partly justified by the nature of the dataset that is considered in the evaluation, it consists of 43 different topics, each event being related to the same event and each large document, each one being related to the same event."}, {"heading": "7 Related work", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it is one of the first etudes."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we presented a method for deriving co-references from textured events based on an in-depth ontological analysis of events and their relationships. First, we provided a formal definition of events and presented a form of ontological analysis of event types. On this basis, we defined a set of conditions for the discovery of event references, which we easily implemented as RDF-based argumentation rules. Finally, we evaluated our approach and hypotheses about the ECB corpus: 19 See, for example, http: / / ontologydesignpatterns.org / wiki / Submissions: EventCorethe experiments show promising results that encourage further investigation into this initial work. In this regard, we plan to expand the current work by considering a greater number of event types to be analyzed and the possibility of applying our method to larger message sets.

In this paper, we propose a method to derive event coreference on text extracted event data using semantic based rule reasoning. We demonstrate our method considering a limited (yet representative) set of event types: we introduce a formal analysis on their ontological properties and, on the base of this, we define a set of coreference criteria. We then implement these criteria as RDF-based reasoning rules to be applied on text extracted event data. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over a standard coreference benchmark dataset.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
