Up to now, linear models [15] have been used for this purpose, but the appropriateness of other models has never been evaluated. Therefore, in this paper, we compare non-linear models with linear models to approximate the duration of the atomic compound specifications. As in previous work, we follow a random sample-based approach. Firstly, by considering a specific similarity measurement m (e.g. Levenshtein) and an implementation of the said measurement quantity (e.g. Ed-Join [22]), we start by collecting runtimes for a particular measurement quantity with different values. These samples can be regarded as output of a function that can predict the duration of the implementation of m for which we were given samples."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "The first three of them are able to go in search of a new home, both in the United States and in the United States."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results", "text": "This year it is as far as never before in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "The task of efficiently executing queries in database systems is similar to the task of executing optimization with runtime approaches in LD frameworks. Efficient and scalable data management has been central in database systems [6]. In recent years, there has been extensive work on query optimization in databases based on statistical information about relationships and intermediate results. [3] The author of provides an analytical overview of the query optimization process and the various approaches used in each step of the process. A novel approach in this area was taken by [7], in which the proposed approach introduced the concept of parametric query optimization. The authors provided the necessary formalization of the aforementioned concept and conducted a series of experiments with buffer size."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have examined approximation functions that make it possible to predict the runtime of link specifications. We have shown that, on average, actually linear models are the approach to choosing this target, as they seem to fit the least. Nevertheless, 14 mixed models also work satisfactorily. Exponential models either fit very well or not at all and are therefore not usable. In future work, we will examine further models to evaluate the runtime and improve existing planning mechanisms for the declarative LD. In particular, we will consider other features when comparing approximation runtimes, such as the distribution of characters in the strings."}], "references": [{"title": "Introduction to linked data and its lifecycle on the web", "author": ["S.
