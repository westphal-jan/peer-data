The latter is particularly important in clinical practice when prioritizing scarce resources or determining the frequency and intensity of relief measures."}, {"heading": "2 Model", "text": "While simple predictive architectures, such as the doc2vec scheme [10], have been established as versatile plug-in modules in many machine learning applications, they are by nature unable to directly recognize complex multi-word or multi-sentence patterns. However, constructions such as pneumothorax are often found in clinical notes and encode important information for the task of predicting mortality. Following recent work in document classification [21] and dialogue systems [17], we adopt a twin architecture. Let us know that the patient record consists of n sentences. Our first layer maps sentences independently of sentence vectors xi P RDS. The second layer includes xx1,., xny into a single patient representation x P RDP. For both levels, we use Convolutionary Neural Networks (CNNs) with maximum pooling, which have shown excellent results in classifying text tasks."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "We evaluate the proposed methodology against three standardized tasks for predicting mortality in ICU. Using a patient's electronic medical records, we predict whether the patient (1) will die during hospitalization, (2) within 30 days of discharge, or (3) within a year of discharge, and report AUC as a benchmark."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data", "text": "MIMIC-III [5] is a freely accessible database for intensive care patients that includes 46,520 patients with 58,976 hospitalizations. It contains measurements of patient status (by vital signs, laboratory tests and other variables) as well as procedures and treatments. Crucially, it also contains over 2 million unstructured text notes written by health care providers. Following the data filtering and pre-processing steps in [3], we limit ourselves to adults (18 years old) with only one hospital admission. Most importantly, we exclude notes from the \"discharge summary\" category and all notes written after the patient's discharge, resulting in 31,244 patients with 812,158 notes. 13.82% of patients died in hospital, 3.70% were discharged and died within thirty days, and 12.06% were discharged and died within a year. We randomly sample 10% of patients for the test set and 10% for the vocabulary we will use during the remaining 80% of the validation of the words."}, {"heading": "3.2 Baselines", "text": "This model is the most advanced method of predicting mortality based on unstructured data from MIMIC II. We build the model on MIMIC III and closely follow its preprocessing and hyperparameter settings. We point to each note and remove all stopwords using the Onix Stopword List 1. The vocabulary is constructed as an association of the 500 most informative words in each patient's note based on a tf-idf metric. All words that are not part of the vocabulary are removed. We keep the number of topics for 50 and set the LDA priors for the topic distributions and the topic word distributions to 50 numbered topics and \u03b2 \"200 vocabulary sizes. We train a separate SVM linear kernel on the per-note distributions to predict the mortality for each task force."}, {"heading": "3.3 Parameters and Pretraining", "text": "We train 50-dimensional word vectors on the training data using the word2vec implementation of the gensim [16] toolbox. Our CNN word level uses 50 filters of size 3, 4 and 5, resulting in a sentence representation of size DS \"150. We embed categories into the 10-dimensional space of DC\" and use 50 filters of size 3 for the sentence level CNN, resulting in a patient representation of size DP \"50. In addition, we regulate the fully connected layer before our final Softmax by l2regularizing weights and suspensions with the probability of 0.8.1www.lextek.com / manals / onix"}, {"heading": "3.4 Results", "text": "Table 1 summarizes the results of the three models for all tasks. Across all methods, there seems to be a general tendency that future labels are more difficult to predict. We observe that both neural models are superior to the LDA baseline, especially for the two more difficult tasks. In addition, our two-step CNN model significantly outperforms doc2vec for all tasks. To emphasize the effectiveness of target replication, Table 2 shows the results of our model with and without target replication. We report more than 30 days after discharge, but the performance for the other tasks is comparable.The results of our CNN show that the modeling of the sentence and document structure explicitly leads to noticeable performance gains. In addition, learning sentence representations and training in our regulator in the classification task allow us to retrieve the most informative sentences of a patient. This allows an inspection of the characteristics of the model, similar to the topic distributions of the LDA, but at the law enforcement level."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this work, we developed a two-tiered Convolutionary Neural Network for the problem of ICU mortality prediction. Based on the MIMIC III ICU database, our model outperforms both existing BOW approaches and the popular doc2vec neural document embedding technique in all three tasks. We conclude that consideration of word and phrase composition is critical for identifying important text patterns. Such results have implications beyond the immediate context of automatic prediction tasks and suggest promising instructions for clinical machine learning research to reduce patient mortality."}], "references": [{"title": "Recurrent neural networks for multivariate time series with missing values", "author": ["Zhengping Che", "Sanjay Purushotham", "Kyunghyun Cho", "David Sontag", "Yan Liu"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01865,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Semi-supervised sequence learning", "author": ["Andrew M.
