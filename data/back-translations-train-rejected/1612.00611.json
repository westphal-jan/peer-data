When physicians are prescribing treatments to a patient, they need to consider a large range of data variety and volume, making decisions increasingly complex. Machine learning based Clinical Decision Support systems can be a solution to the data challenges. In this work we focus on a class of decision support in which the physicians' decision is directly predicted. Concretely, the model would assign higher probabilities to decisions that it presumes the physician are more likely to make. Thus the CDS system can provide physicians with rational recommendations. We also address the problem of correlation in target features: Often a physician is required to make multiple (sub-)decisions in a block, and that these decisions are mutually dependent. We propose a solution to the target correlation problem using a tensor factorization model. In order to handle the patients' historical information as sequential data, we apply the so-called Encoder-Decoder-Framework which is based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) as encoders and a tensor factorization model as a decoder, a combination which is novel in machine learning. With experiments with real-world datasets we show that the proposed model does achieve better prediction performances.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 10:03:09 GMT  (396kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00611v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yinchong yang", "peter a fasching", "markus wallwiener", "tanja n fehm", "sara y brucker", "volker tresp"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00611"}, "pdf": {"name": "1612.00611.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Predictive Clinical Decision Support System with RNN Encoding and Tensor Decoding", "authors": ["Yinchong Yang", "Peter A.

After pre-treatment, we were able to extract information on 1245 patients: the 1) basic information, 2) primary tumor and 3) history of metastatic disease prior to entry into the study. These data are considered static and consist of a total of 26 characteristics of binary, categorical or real types. We perform performeddummy coding in the previous two cases and were able to extract for each patient i a static trait vector associated with mi-R114The sequential information consists of two categories. Firstly, 4) local recurrence, 5) metastatic and 6) visits include information on clinical events, such as progression and live status, which we refer to as events. Secondly, there are three types of therapy information: 7) radiotherapy categories, 8) systemic therapies, and 9) each of which are categorical therapies."}, {"heading": "2.2 Modeling Solution", "text": "First, we associate the sequential and static data on a patient i up to a time step > > by constructing a latent representation vector: a < i, t > = (g ({x [t \u2032] i) t \u2032 = 1) | \u03c3 (H Tmi)), (1) where g refers to an RNN encoder that outputs only the last hidden state in the input sequence {x [t \u2032] i) tt \u2032 = 1. This approach was first proposed by [9], where it has been proven that such an RNN encoder is capable of encoding all information in a sequence of variable length into a single real vector. We use this aspect of such RNN encoders and apply this vector to represent the patient-specific temporal information encoded by < i, t > index. We augment this information by linking it to the static patient information encoded by a matrix-linear."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "We point 80% of all 1245 patients to the training plan and 20% to the test set. Then we ask all the static and sequential information as well as the goals underlying the training patients and test patients. Since the RNN model implements the LSTM with the hidden state of size 25 and the mapping of the static information into a latent size 15 space using a simple log linear mapping of matrix H as Figure 2, we implement a rank 5 Tucker-3 model. We apply 0.1 dropout regulation to the RNN part and 0.1 comb regulation to the rest of the parameters in the model."}, {"heading": "4 Discussions", "text": "The main contribution of our work is to propose a new model architecture by combining an RNN encoder with a tensor factorization model, both of which share a common latent representation. Thetensor factorization component models the common likelihood of target characteristics rather than thresholds. We therefore suspect that our model is capable of detecting correlations between target characteristics, which are often relevant for the modelling of clinical decisions. We show that the proposed model achieves better predictive results in experiments with real data sets. In this paper, we only perform predictions of radiotherapy. We will extend our work to the other two therapies in our dataset: systemic therapy and operations. Specifically, the first model has three objectives and would require a 4-D tensor."}], "references": [{"title": "Electronic health records: a survey", "author": ["R. Rahman", "C.K.
