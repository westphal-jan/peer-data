It is well known that for similarity search the superiority of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) over Euclidean distance gradually diminishes as we consider ever larger datasets. However, as we shall show, the same is not true for clustering. Clustering time series under DTW remains a computationally expensive operation. In this work, we address this issue in two ways. We propose a novel pruning strategy that exploits both the upper and lower bounds to prune off a very large fraction of the expensive distance calculations. This pruning strategy is admissible and gives us provably identical results to the brute force algorithm, but is at least an order of magnitude faster. For datasets where even this level of speedup is inadequate, we show that we can use a simple heuristic to order the unavoidable calculations in a most-useful-first ordering, thus casting the clustering into an anytime framework. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with both single and multidimensional case studies in the domains of astronomy, speech physiology, medicine and entomology. In addition, we show the generality of our clustering framework to other domains by efficiently obtaining semantically significant clusters in protein sequences using the Edit Distance, the discrete data analogue of DTW.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 11:27:44 GMT  (2519kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00637v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nurjahan begum", "liudmila ulanova", "hoang anh dau", "jun wang", "eamonn keogh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00637"}, "pdf": {"name": "1612.00637.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A General Framework for Density Based Time Series Clustering Exploiting a Novel Admissible Pruning Strategy", "authors": ["Nurjahan Begum", "Liudmila Ulanova", "Hoang Anh Dau", "Jun Wang", "Eamonn Keogh"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is well known that when looking for similarities, the superiority of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) over Euclidean distance gradually diminishes as we look at larger and larger data sets.

E-mail: wangjun @ utdallas.edu.Bvant data have not yet been solved. For most data mining algorithms of time series, the quality of the results depends almost exclusively on the distance measure used [49]. In the last ten years, a consensus has emerged that the DTW distance measure is the best measure in most areas and almost always exceeds the Euclidean distance (ED) and other alleged rivals [49]. As a concrete example, we consider the two clusters of three randomly selected mammals shown in Fig. 2. The input data is mitochondrial DNA after it has been converted into a time series representation (the conversion of DNA into time series is a commonly used operation [40] [41]). Two types of DNA mutations, insertions and deletions have the effect of \"warping\" the time series. At least in this case, we can see that these mutations (and mutations) are uncommon."}, {"heading": "1.1 Why This Problem Is Hard", "text": "Since the DTW is intrinsically slow due to its quadratic complexity of time, there are two ideas that are commonly used to mitigate the problem of using such a slow distance measurement [41]. We discuss them here only to dismiss them as possible solutions. However, the convergence of DTW and Euclidean distances means that for many problems, including the discovery of motives [35] and classification [49], the results of DTW and Euclidean distances tend to become increasingly similar as the datasets grow larger, suggesting that it is more efficient to use the distance of euclides to collect large datasets. Increasing effectiveness of lower datasets increases."}, {"heading": "1.2 Why Existing Work Is Not the Answer", "text": "In general, many cluster algorithms achieve scalability by using a spatial access method. For example, the scalable version of the ubiquitous DBSCAN uses an R * tree [12]. However, because DTW is not a metric, it is very difficult to index it, especially for long (i.e., high-dimensional) time series objects. Beyond the need to support DTW scalable, we note the need for a cluster algorithm that supports inventory against outliers. That is, unlike some cluster methods that attempt to explain all the data, we believe that it is particularly important to enable a time series cluster algorithms that ignore some data. Consider the example in Fig. 4. We took twelve objects from a heraldic shield dataset that we group with k-means and DP."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "It is a question of whether and how such a collapse can occur if such a collapse occurs.

However, the problem we want to solve is DTW, which is itself a very expensive distance measurement. In situations where even the data can be stored in main memory, the time needed to cluster can be in the order of days / weeks. So the problem we are interested in is that the CPU is limited, not the I / O."}, {"heading": "3.1 Anytime Algorithms", "text": "For most clustering algorithms, it is well known that not all distance measurements contribute equally to the final clustering mapping. For example, a recent paper on hierarchical clustering shows (under some mild assumptions) that it is possible to capture the true structure of clustering using just carefully selected O (n log2 n) distance calculations [28]. The fact that some distance calculations are more important than others immediately suggests that we should use algorithms at all times, provided that we can find only an efficient and (even somewhat) effective test to identify these influential distance calculations. Remember that algorithms are algorithms that can provide a valid solution to a problem even if they are interrupted before they are finished [60] [61]. Starting with a negligible amount of set-up time, these algorithms always have the best response available, and the quality of the response improves as the execution time increases."}, {"heading": "4 ALGORITHM", "text": "We start with the review of the basic algorithm, which we will expand and specialize in order to deal with DTW."}, {"heading": "4.1 Density Peaks Algorithm Overview", "text": "We have decided to expand the DP framework to address major time series clustering problems because not only do the following points mean that abnormal objects themselves cannot be clustered, but the presence of these objects can affect the labels of objects that can be clustered in unpredictable ways.

DP algorithms are able to handle datasets whose clusters can form arbitrary shapes, in contrast to kmeans and related algorithms that assume that the clusters are \"spheres\" in space.

Only the latter step is acceptable at any time; however, the first step can be considered setup time [3] [60]. Before attempting to create an oracle order function, it will be instructive to look at two baselines: What is the best thing we could do, and what would we have to do to claim that we beat the most obvious straws? The best order we consider heuristic is an oracle order. We can calculate this by cheating the algorithm. At each step of the algorithm, this order chooses the object that maximizes the current edge index. The algorithm cheats because a clustering algorithm does not normally have access to class labels."}, {"heading": "5 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "5.2 Parameter Sensitivity Experiments", "text": "In order to show that TADPole is not sensitive to parameter settings, we took the symbol and insect dataset [25] and performed TADPole with k = 6 and k = 11, respectively.

(a) and (b), there is a very wide range of choices for the values of dc, resulting in high-quality clustering. We performed the same experiment for several other datasets (see [64] for details), and the results confirm our claim that TADPole is not sensitive to these limit parameters. Despite this finding, it is clearly desirable to have instructions for parameter setting.

We illustrate our results in Fig. 15. From Fig. 15, we can see that the value obtained for various distorting window widths closely matches the corresponding Edge Index for a fixed DC. As long as the distorting window width remains in a relatively high range, we can consider the parameter selection to be good. At this point, we are now able to answer the following question: If the distortion window width is reasonably well set, how do we estimate dc? We use the same approach for distorting window size as for setting the distorting window size. First, we set a reasonably good value of the distorting window size for a fixed dc according to the good distortion function described above, and we now set the distortion zone of your window to the value of the good distortion function. \""}, {"heading": "6 CASE STUDIES", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Electromagnetic Articulograph Dataset", "text": "The device consists of a series of inconspicuous accelerometers attached to multiple locations on the tongue, lips, jaw, nose, and forehead that can record high-resolution 3D motion data in real time.

including data editing for classifiers, summarization, and outlier detection. It is well known that for similarity search the superiority of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) over Euclidean distance gradually diminishes as we consider ever larger datasets. However, as we shall show, the same is not true for clustering. Clustering time series under DTW remains a computationally expensive operation. In this work, we address this issue in two ways. We propose a novel pruning strategy that exploits both the upper and lower bounds to prune off a very large fraction of the expensive distance calculations. This pruning strategy is admissible and gives us provably identical results to the brute force algorithm, but is at least an order of magnitude faster. For datasets where even this level of speedup is inadequate, we show that we can use a simple heuristic to order the unavoidable calculations in a most-useful-first ordering, thus casting the clustering into an anytime framework. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with both single and multidimensional case studies in the domains of astronomy, speech physiology, medicine and entomology. In addition, we show the generality of our clustering framework to other domains by efficiently obtaining semantically significant clusters in protein sequences using the Edit Distance, the discrete data analogue of DTW.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
