Supervised- or weakly supervised training enables the detection of findings that are known a priori. It does not scale well, and a priori definition limits the vocabulary of markers to known entities reducing the accuracy of diagnosis and prognosis. Here, we propose the identification of anomalies in large-scale medical imaging data using healthy examples as a reference. We detect and categorize candidates for anomaly findings untypical for the observed data. A deep convolutional autoencoder is trained on healthy retinal images. The learned model generates a new feature representation, and the distribution of healthy retinal patches is estimated by a one-class support vector machine. Results demonstrate that we can identify pathologic regions in images without using expert annotations. A subsequent clustering categorizes findings into clinically meaningful classes. In addition the learned features outperform standard embedding approaches in a classification task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 14:05:49 GMT  (669kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00686v1", "Extended Abstract, Accepted for NIPS 2016 Workshop \"Machine Learning for Health\""]], "COMMENTS": "Extended Abstract, Accepted for NIPS 2016 Workshop \"Machine Learning for Health\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["philipp seeb\\\"ock", "sebastian waldstein", "sophie klimscha", "bianca s gerendas", "ren\\'e donner", "thomas schlegl", "ursula schmidt-erfurth", "georg langs"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00686"}, "pdf": {"name": "1612.00686.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Identifying and Categorizing Anomalies in Retinal Imaging Data", "authors": ["Philipp Seeb\u00f6ck", "Sebastian Waldstein", "Sophie Klimscha", "Bianca S.

First, we identify the upper and lower layer of the retina using a graph-based surface segmentation algorithm [7], using the lower layer to project the retina on a horizontal plane.

As shown in Table 1, our method reaches a cube of 0.55, which is a clear improvement over PCA256 and PCA0.95. This is also reflected in the visualization provided in Figure 1 (a) - (d), which shows significant overlap between the notes of truth on the ground and DCAEent segmentation. DCAEent provides less diffuse segmentation compared to PCA0.95, which captures the appearance of retina pathology in a meaningful way. In terms of anomaly categorization, the lowest DB index for 7 clusters was found, as shown in Figure 1 (f)."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we propose a method for detecting abnormal regions in OCT images that require only healthy training data. In a second step, the identified abnormal regions are segmented by clusters into subclasses. Results show that our proposed method is not only able to find abnormalities in invisible images, but also classifies these results into clinically significant classes. Identifying new abnormalities instead of automating known abnormalities by experts is a critical shift in medical image analysis, affecting disease categorization, treatment monitoring, and the discovery of relationships between genetic factors and phenotypes."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economics and the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (I2714-B31).
