Introduction", "text": "Fuzzy Logic (FL), due to its nature of characterizing the ambiguous situations of our daily lives by multiple values, provides rich resources for assessing such situations. A characteristic example is the process of learning a topic in which the new knowledge is often associated with a degree of uncertainty and / or uncertainty from the student's point of view, as well as the teacher's point of view. In 1999, Voskoglou [10] developed a blurred model for describing the learning process of a topic in the classroom in terms of the possibilities of student profiles, and later he evaluated the student's learning abilities by calculating all the possible uncertainty of the system [11]. Meanwhile, Subbotin et al. [1], based on Voskoglous's model [10], duly developed the Center of Gravity (COG) Entfusification technique commonly used in blurred mathematics and used it as an alternative assessment of student learning abilities."}, {"heading": "2. Traditional Assessment Methods", "text": "The evaluation methods commonly used in practice are based on principles of bivalent logic. A very popular evaluation method in the USA and other Western countries, on the other hand, is the calculation of the Grade Point Average (GPA) Index. This index is a weighted average in which the higher values are associated with higher coefficients (weights). GPA, which is associated with the performance of the quality group, is calculated using the formula GPA = nnnn ABCDF 43210 (1), where n is the total number of group members and nA, nB, nC, nD and nF are the numbers of group members who have excellent (A), very good (C), fair (D) and unsatisfactory (F) values higher than GyF = 4 (GyF = 4), which have satisfactory values in the group."}, {"heading": "3. The COG Defuzzification Technique as an Assessment Method (RFAM)", "text": "The solution to the problem of EU membership is generally as follows: Choice of the universal group U of Discourse (2). Fuzzification of the problem's data by definition of the proper membershipfunctions. Evaluation of fuzzy data by applying rules and principles in the EU that determine the solution required. Defuzzification of the final results in order to use in the original, real world problem. One of the most popular in the EU defuzzification methods is the Centre of Gravity (COG) technique. For the application of this method, let us assume that A = x, m (x) the final solution will be found in the EU, is the determination of the problem in the Fuzzy cs defuzzification methods (COG) technique."}, {"heading": "4. Variations of the COG Technique (GRFAM, TFAM and TpFAM)", "text": "These values can only be linked to the linguistic labels of U as follows: A (85-100), B (75-84), C (60-74), D (50-59), and F (0-49) *. Ambiguous cases occur in practice because they are at the boundaries between two successive grades of assessment; for example, something like 84-85%, because they are at the boundaries between A and B. In an effort to better handle such cases, subbotin [4], the rectangles of Figure 1 are \"shifted\" to the left so that the common parts are divided (see Figure 2). The ambiguous cases lying at the common rectangles belong to both successive grades, which means that these parts must be taken into account twice in the corresponding calculations."}, {"heading": "5. Comparison of the Assessment Methods", "text": "One can write formulas (6), (8) and (9) of section 4 in the single form: Xc = 51 (0.7) 0.2i i iy, Yc = 5 21ii a y (10), where a = 12 for GRFAM, a = 1 5 for TFAM and a = 3 7 for TpFAM.Combining formulas (10) with the common evaluation criterion given in section 4 one can obtain the following result: 5.1 THEOREM: The three variants of the COG technique, i.e. the GRFAM, the TFAM and the TpFAM are equivalent evaluation models. Furthermore, the first evaluation of formulas (10) asXc = 0.7 (y1 + 2y2 + 3y3) can be compared."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion and Perspectives for Future Research", "text": "From the discussion in this paper, it appears that the RFAM and its variants GRFAM, TFAM and TpFAM, although they always provide the same evaluation results when comparing the performance of two groups, do not constitute equivalent evaluation methods. Therefore, the above evaluation results are identical to those of the GPA index, unless the evaluation groups share the same values. In the latter case, the GPA index could not lead to logically based conclusions. Therefore, in this case, either the use of RFAM or its variations must be preferred. Previous work by the author has also used other blurred evaluation methods, such as measuring the uncertainty of a system [11] and applying the blurred numbers [17]. Unlike previous methods, which focus on the quality performance of the respective group, they measure its average performance. Plans for our future research include efforts to compare all these methods in order to obtain analogous conclusions."}], "references": [{"title": "Application of fuzzy logic to learning assessment", "author": ["Subbotin", "I.
