To determine the similarity of two ICD code sequences, one can compare their primary diagnosis (i.e., their first ICD code) [1, 6] or calculate their hamming distance [5]. A major difficulty in comparing ICD code sequences is variation in coding, i.e., different ICD codes can be used to record the same disease. For example, both ICD codes I20.0 and R57.0 are related to the \"heart problem.\" Another difficulty is the sequential meaning in the code sequences that most existing approaches fail to establish the clinical relationship between syntactically different ICD codes or the relative position of ICD within a similar space."}, {"heading": "2 Word2Vec based matching (WVM)", "text": "The proposed WVM method for comparing patient similarity has two phases. 30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.ar Xiv: 161 2.01 812v 1 [cs.L G] 2D ec2 01"}, {"heading": "2.1 Phase 1: Learning ICD code vectors", "text": "WVM uses Word2Vec (Skip-gram model [7]) to learn ICD code vectors that can capture the latent relationships between ICD codes.

These ICD code vectors are then used in a sequential matching algorithm in phase 2."}, {"heading": "2.2 Phase 2: Building a matching algorithm", "text": "The inputs of the sequential matching (SM) algorithm are a group of cases (case group) and a group of controls (control group). We will describe how we select case group and control group in Section 3.2. SM has three main steps. Step 1: For a given case tc (i) it finds a validation group consisting of controls that have the same sex and age group as tc (i). Matching to factors such as gender and age is commonly used in case control studies [8]. Step 2: It generates two sets of S and compares the controls that match t ICD codes in tc (i) (t-0, n] where n is the number of ICD codes in tc (i). Step 3: It matches tc (i) with a control on S and matched.Steps 2 and 3 to find a suitable control ICD is the ICD."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data", "text": "The data set is a cancer cohort of more than 220,000 patients (58.2% men, mean age 71) collected from a national cancer registry of 21 hospitals in Australia between 1997 and 2012. The data sets include demographic data and diagnoses indicated by ICD-10 codes. There is no information on laboratories, procedures or medicines. A subset of data for control comparison was selected as follows: 1) We removed ICD codes that occurred less than 30 times; 2) We retained only those admissions that had at least one ICD code; and 3) We removed admissions that occurred after 2008 / 12 / 31. The remaining data set contains 1,810,967 admissions (216,844 individual patients)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Construction of case group and control group", "text": "First, we randomly selected a combination of a hospital H and an admission year Y from the data set. Then, we selected the admission that had the same hospital and admission year as H and Y. Note that each admission is related to a different patient. This admission is called HY. Finally, we created the case group by selecting 200 images from HY in a random sample. The remaining images in HY were used to form the control group. Admission to the control group is associated with patients who are different from those in the case group."}, {"heading": "3.3 Performance evaluation", "text": "To make a fair comparison, all baselines were performed after step 1 was performed in the SM (i.e. after we received a validation group), and each time we received 200 cases and 200 matching controls, measuring the consistency of the two cohorts with the two clinical outcomes."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Readmission matching accuracy", "text": "Let study (i) = (y1, y2,..., y200) represent a set of 200 case readmission status when iterating i (true values). yr = study (i) r (r [1,200]) is one of four readmission status: \"failure\" (0.01%), \"readmission within 28 days to another facility\" (4.07%), \"readmission within 28 days to the same facility\" (23.03%) and \"not formally resumed within 28 days\" (72.089%). Let (i) represent a set of return status of 200 matching controls when iterating i (predicted values).The readmission accuracy when iterating i is calculated as follows. acc (i) = 200 x r = 1O (study (i) r = 1O (study (i) r, match (i) r, match (i) r / 200, match (de), match (1), where Vi (1) is more accurate than the Vi (1)."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Incidence rate (IR) error for cancer mortality", "text": "Leave Trial (i) = (s1, t1), (s2, t2), (s2, t2), (s200, t200) a series of 2-tuples (release date, death date) of 200 cases at the time of iteration i. Each case has a release date and a death date that can be zero. For example, the first case in the case group (release date, death date) has a value of (2005 / 07 / 11, 2008 / 05 / 12); the second case has a value (release date, death date) of (2005 / 10 / 27, zero). The incidence of the case group at the time of iteration i (true value) is calculated as follows."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced WVM, a clinical outcome-based case-control matching method that utilizes both the representative similarity between the ICD-10 codes and the sequential structure of the coding at each recording. Evaluating two measures of similarity based on clinical outcomes, namely reuptake accuracy and cancer mortality incidence rate errors, proves that WVM is a more effective solution to match patient similarity in a large cancer cohort. In practice, this means that WVM can identify a control cohort that better matches the case cohort, minimizing potential distortion between the two cohorts, enabling more effective experiments or quasi-experiments with a large coded dataset similar to ours."}], "references": [{"title": "Mcneill dysphagia therapy program: a case-control study", "author": ["Giselle Carnaby-Mann", "Michael
