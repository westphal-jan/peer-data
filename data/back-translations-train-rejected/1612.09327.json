INTRODUCTION", "text": "NLP is a critical component of artificial intelligence. NLP can be used to understand and process the knowledge provided to the system [1]. NLP improvises the system and causes it to behave humanely when properly programmed. QAS is used for fast information extraction, freeing the user from reading unnecessary information that may not lead to the answer. QAS has various NLP models that are used. These models are symbol comparisons where they use linguistic annotations, structured world knowledge and semantic parsing [2]. There are different types of symbolic comparison models such as the frame semantic parsing method, the word distance benchmark method [3]. These methods are not effective because they are only able to answer simple questions."}, {"heading": "2. ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK", "text": "Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is made up of interconnected processors called neurons. Each neuron processes information and passes it on to the next neurons. It is designed to function in a similar way to the human brain. In this proposed QAS, we use neural networks to store and query information. We try to mimic the information characteristics of humans by linking the information associated with them. The strength of the connection between the two units of knowledge is directly related to the relationship between them. The neural network represents the information understood by the system. ANN has been used to solve various tasks that are difficult to solve in the field of machine learning, such as speech recognition, handwriting and answering questions. ANN can be used to store the previously processed information and can later be used for knowledge conclusions."}, {"heading": "2.1. Natural Language Processing", "text": "NLP is an area of artificial intelligence, cognitive science and computational linguistics. It plays an important role in human-computer interaction. A computer only understands 1 and 0, and humans interact with each other using natural language. In order for a computer to understand and process the language used by the human NLP, it is necessary. The document provided to QAS contains data in natural language so that the QAS can process the content of the document and generate ANN; we use NLP. We used the following NLP functions. Part 1 of Language (POS) Tagging It is used to label words from sentences with language components such as noun, verb, adverb, etc. Example: \"Popeye eats spinach\" nouns - Popeye and spinach. Verb - eats.2. Entity Recognition It is used to classify bandatomic elements in sentences into categories such as person, place, time, etc.: \"Gandhiji Porhiar Porhi Porhi Porhi Porhi Person\" was born in bandbandatomic tape recorder."}, {"heading": "2.2. Deep Neural Network", "text": "In processing natural language, we can take advantage of the properties of the Deep Neural Network (DNN), which contains several hidden layers, and such layers can help identify the relationship between different units of knowledge and generate answers at the same time.Two neurons do not appear to be directly connected to each other in a simple ANN, but are indirectly connected via DNN. Such indirect relationships can be found when we construct a DNN for the same thing. Suppose we want to find out if two people belong to the same village. We can assume that if there are blood relationships between the two, they belong to the same village.The knowledge provided may not provide sufficient information about the blood relationship. ANN is constructed only by the data provided to the system. DNN can be used to go beyond the data provided to the system and identify the relationship between the two individuals."}, {"heading": "3. INTELLIGENT INFORMATION EXTRACTION SYSTEM", "text": "The proposed QAS consists of two phases: learning and extraction. The system learns when new information is fed to it. During learning, new neurons (words) or connections between neurons are added to the existing network. When a question is asked to the system, it switches to the second phase to extract the answer to the question asked. The block diagram of the proposed QAS is shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "3.1. Sentence Analysis", "text": "This step involves the processing of natural language, in which we derive units of knowledge from sentences and words (neurons) from the unit of knowledge."}, {"heading": "3.2. Assigning Deep Case", "text": "We assign deep cases to the neurons in the artificial neural network in order to improve its consequence capability. The deep cases we will consider are shown below in Table 1."}, {"heading": "3.3. Network Creation", "text": "After sentence analysis, we form an artificial neural network from the extracted words. If words exist in the same unit of knowledge, we establish a connection between them."}, {"heading": "3.4. Question Analysis", "text": "In question analysis, it can be estimated from the nature of the question asked which answer should be extracted, for example, if the question contains \"where,\" then the answer will contain a place. Words from the question are also extracted to search the neurons and the connection between them."}, {"heading": "3.5. Search in Neural Network", "text": "The neurons (words) extracted from the question analysis are searched in ANN to find connections between them, which leads to the knowledge layer."}, {"heading": "3.6. Backtrack to Knowledge Layer", "text": "This step involves generating a unit of knowledge that may be the answer to the question asked by the user."}, {"heading": "4. RESULT", "text": "We have conducted an experiment to provide QAS with a document containing the details of Mahatma Gandhi. Step 1: In this step, we take input sentences (text data) from the user. Let's say document contains the following details. \"Gandhiji was born in Porbandar on October 2, 1869.\" Step 2: In this step, we divide the input sentences into words and assign a unique ID to each word. Step 4: In this step, we assign a word type to each word. The mapping of each word type is shown in Table 4.Step 3: Now we assign deep cases to each word. Table 5 shows the various deep cases associated with each word. Step 6: In this step, we define the relationship between words and units of knowledge. Row 1 in Table 6 shows that ID1 and ID2 are related sentences to each word."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The proposed system overcomes the problems encountered in current systems to answer the complex question from the text document provided by the user. The proposed system solves this problem by assigning a deep case to each neuron, which improves the ability to answer more complex questions."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "Our thanks go to M.H.
