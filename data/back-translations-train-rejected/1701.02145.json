H.Debar et al. [14], S. Axelsson et al. [15], S. Amer et al. [16], C.Xenakis et al. [17], Hung-Ten Lia et al. [18] have previously presented surveys and taxonomies for detecting intrusions. This research builds on their work and introduces deep networking techniques that do not describe all of these referenced works. Given the increasing value of big data, deep networks are an important element for detection in an IDS taxonomy. The taxonomy presented in this paper provides a fine-grained overview of the various machine learning techniques for detecting intrusions, as shown in Figure 2.1. Detection mainly depends on the data source and penetration technique used. The data source are the nodes that collect the information for analysis. The source can be either host or network-based, or both. These two sources are discussed further in section 1.1."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 Host Based IDS (HIDS) Vs. Network Based IDS (NIDS)", "text": "Host-based IDS were the first type of IDS to be implemented [19]. HIDS are software-based products installed on a host computer that analyze and monitor all traffic activity on the system application files and operating systems [20]. Traffic activity collected by the system application files and systems is referred to as audit trails [22] - [24]. HIDS has the advantage of being able to detect threats from within by scanning traffic activity before it sends and receives data [25]. Its main drawback is that only the host computer is monitored, which means it must be installed on each host [26]. Network-based IDS are found at specific points in the network to detect and analyze the stream of packets passing through network connections, as opposed to HIDS, whose approach is to analyze each host separately [27] [28] [28]."}, {"heading": "2.1.2 Anomaly Based Detection", "text": "This year, it will be able to put itself at the top of the group."}, {"heading": "2.1.3 Signature Based Detection", "text": "In fact, it is the case that it will be able to be in a position to be in the position in which it is."}, {"heading": "2.1.4 Discussion", "text": "A summary table of intrusion techniques, data sources, applications and data used in selected verified papers between 2014 and 2016 is included in Table II.H.

Different radar diagrams with different colors were used for the analysis. Analysis of MLP-BP and SOM showed that MLP-BP had a better detection rate, minimum false-positive, minimum false-negative, time saving and cost effectiveness.

The difference between the MLP and the Deep Networks is in their training procedures. This is a class of ML techniques in which the classification is done through training data with many layers in hierarchical networks with unattended learning. Deepnetworks are inspired by the architectural depth of the brain. In 2006, Hinton et al. developed Deep Belief Network (DBN) [134] from the University of Toronto. They trained data with an algorithm that greedily trained layer by layer of unattended learning for each layer of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [135]. Following this discovery by Hinton et al., other Deep Networks were successfully introduced according to the same principle in the classification task [136]. Deep Networks IDS can be classified by the way the architectures and techniques are used.
