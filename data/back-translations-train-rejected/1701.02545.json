State of the Art", "text": "However, before we talk about the case study, it is necessary to review the concepts involved. Furthermore, within the IoT context, we want to review a specific concept, the IoT platforms, which were created to bring the IoT to more people, industry and research, thereby expanding the possibilities of the IoT. With these platforms, we can communicate with objects that are thousands of miles apart or located in places that we cannot imagine. Perhaps, behind enemy lines on a battlefield, in a nuclear power plant, in a sealed room full of chemicals or radioactive products, or even in places where they cannot be reached after they have been set up [9, 10]. Blurred logic is also a technology that is used in many research. The use of this technology is multiple and it could be useful in a wide range of areas where, for example, the blurred logic can be used to automatically achieve the simulation of an artificial pancreas, 12 which is a specific situation of blood glucose regulation in a combination of 11]."}, {"heading": "2.1. Fuzzy Logic", "text": "The term fuzzy logic was introduced in 1965 by Lotfi Asker Zadeh to deal with common sense. He introduced fuzzy sets first in [16] and then fuzzy logic was defined and presented in [17]. Since then, many research has addressed issues related to fuzzy logic. A common problem in which fuzzy logic is normally applied is battery conservation. For example, Larios et al. [18] has succeeded in finding a device that avoids many location errors and thus achieves better accuracy. Moreover, their approach allows to reduce the energy consumption of other elements such as GPS. Chamodrakas and Martakos suggest using the fuzzy set representation method to connect to a low energy consumption with which they are associated."}, {"heading": "2.2. The Internet of Things", "text": "In recent years, networking between heterogeneous and ubiquitous objects has been one of the most important research and economic issues. This networking is better known than the Internet of Things [24, 25]. Furthermore, the IoT is also one of the most important technologies for the future according to the ONU in 2005 [24], where the United Nations predicted a new era with more traffic generated by objects than by humans. Furthermore, in 2008, the National Intelligence Council of the United States reported that they considered the IoT as one of the six technologies in which the United States would be more interested from 2008 to 2025 [26]. However, there is no standard or unique way to work with the IoT. There are many different platforms for connecting objects over the Internet [27, 28] and a number of standards for communicating the objects, such as Near Field Communications (NFC), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Bluetooth or Message Queue Telemetry Transport (QMT)."}, {"heading": "2.3. IoT platforms", "text": "Due to the popularity and growth of IoT, several platforms have been developed to connect heterogeneous objects over the Internet. Heterogeneity is one reason for the development of IoT platforms. As stated in [31], the development of IoT solutions for different smart objects of different manufacturers is difficult due to the lack of standards such as communication and networking protocols. Therefore, they propose a new development model based on the handling of user interfaces in the cloud. In this way, their proposal achieves the development of cross-platform and ubiquitous applications. However, this approach does not take into account the linkages between objects like other IoT platforms. There are many platforms and many types and their objectives can be very different. Several platforms have been developed for business communities such as Xively [32] and they allow companies to benefit from the advantages of the IoT in order to safely connect their products with their users, improve their customer satisfaction and generate new revenue, such as resources [33]."}, {"heading": "2.3.1. ThingSpeak", "text": "ThinkSpeak [33] is an open IoT platform for connecting objects via web standards. Some of its services include data registration, processing, and distribution, location-based services, many plug-ins, and other useful services. To create new objects or services, you first need to select the device type (Arduino, Netduino, ioBridge, or others) and provide the credentials (IP, port, subnet mask, etc.) to create a new channel through which the data from the connected devices can be pushed, displayed, consumed via HTTP requests, or downloaded in XML, JSON, or CSV formats."}, {"heading": "2.3.2. Midgar", "text": "Midgar [27, 28] uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called Midgar Object Interconnection Specific Language (MOISL) to generate applications that connect heterogeneous and ubiquitous objects over the Internet. Midgar users can easily and quickly connect different objects via a graphical DSL. Through this DSL, users can define the application flow to connect many objects, read arbitrary data from their services, and trigger certain actions in the same objects or in other connected objects. These actions can be different between different objects, and an application can connect many different objects and trigger different actions. Finally, Midgar processes the model defined by users with MOISL and creates the application that connects the different selected objects and sends different instructions depending on the user definition."}, {"heading": "2.4. Related work", "text": "There are several commercial solutions that allow the management of the temperature of certain places. Two of these solutions are Loxon [35] and tado \u0445 [36]. In addition, there is also some research that combines the IoT and a blurred logic such as Vitruvius [6, 21]."}, {"heading": "2.4.1. Loxone", "text": "Loxone [35] is a system for controlling blinds, lighting, music systems or air conditioning systems. If we focus on temperature, this system has several advantages and disadvantages compared to our approach. Some advantages are that it takes into account the user's geolocation and registers the temperature to calculate trends and improve future work. However, it also has disadvantages such as the high purchase price and the complexity of installation. In addition, Loxone does not use third-party data, while our purpose is to collect data from open IoT online platforms."}, {"heading": "2.4.2. tado\u25e6", "text": "tado \u0445 [36] is an intelligent thermostat that can be controlled via a web interface or smartphone. It can use the geolocation of the user like Loxone, although its installation is easier than Loxone. tado \u0445 also allows us to save money with good temperature control. In addition, it generates detailed reports and takes into account the weather forecast to keep the ambient temperature. The latter feature is comparable to the collection of data from open IoT online platforms, so this is a common point between tado \u0445 and our proposal. However, there are also disadvantages such as the high purchase price and it does not automate anything, so it cannot be considered intelligent."}, {"heading": "2.4.3. Vitruvius", "text": "Vitruvius [6, 21] is a platform that allows users to generate real-time applications that use sensors installed in vehicles. Vitruvius has a web application for this purpose, put together by an application editor that allows the development of applications. Some of the sensors available are speed sensors, temperature sensors and many similar. Vitruvius combines the IoT with fuzzy logic to reduce the push data frequency. Its early versions did not use fuzzy logic, so the data was pushed to the server every second [37]. Due to the fuzzy logic, the crowded data volumes were reduced and the data quality and data analysis performance improved. However, the use of fuzzy logic makes it difficult to detect errors. While Vitruvius used fuzzy logic to automate the pressing of data to the server at the best moment, we use the fuzzy logic to control the temperature with a good intention to automate the temperature and to save money by sensing the temperature."}, {"heading": "3. Case study", "text": "In this paper, we propose a system that automatically controls the temperature of a particular location using fuzzy logic. To this end, we developed a prototype inspired by the IoT context. The prototype consumes data from sensors and IoT platforms. Sensors were installed in microcontrollers and microcomputers, but the microcomputers were not only used for data consumption, but also for handling the actuators that simulate temperature control. For this essay, we simulated the temperature control with five LEDs (Figure 1) representing the next five states in an enclosed space:"}, {"heading": "3.1. Temperature control", "text": "The developed prototypes use three input values from different IoT sources to control the temperature. \u2022 External temperatures are based on the values of the table, whose input values are temperature and humidity. \u2022 Production after the application of the unclear rubles is a set of values that indicate the degree of truth of seven linguistic variables that were used to represent the obvious temperature. \u2022 The linguistic variables that are used are the next fusions. \u2022 Between -15 C and -5 C are the values that are used to represent the degree of veracity of seven linguistic variables that are used to represent the apparent temperature. \u2022 The linguistic variables that are used."}, {"heading": "3.2. Architecture", "text": "The system architecture can be divided into three levels: data acquisition, data processing and actuators. Figure 5 shows the three layers and their modules. Each layer depends on the others. The first layer, data acquisition, contains the modules that collect data to be processed from external and local sources. The layer Data processing collects the collected data and processes it to make decisions. The last layer, actuators, makes the decisions made in the previous shift and directs them to the target actuator to take the appropriate action."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Data collection", "text": "In our tests, we focused on the use of two IoT platforms, one for temperature, Midgar, and another for humidity, ThingSpeak. The IoT platform used to collect temperature data was Midgar. Midgar is useful for easily connecting smart objects to each other. In fact, knowledge of programming languages is not required [27, 28]. We used Midgar to connect an Arduino Uno to our system via HTTP requests via a REST web service. This Arduino had a temperature sensor that we used to determine the outside temperature. To collect the humidity data, we used another IoT platform, ThingSpeak. This platform enables us to collect the humidity data via HTTP that other users of the platform had previously published. Our system collects data not only from external sources, but also from local sources. We used a Raspberry format to obtain the temperature we used to capture the temperature or the usual Pi system."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Data processor", "text": "To this end, we have implemented two modules that process the external data and the local data. External data sources are IoT platforms, whereas local data sources are devices located in the space in which we want to handle the temperature. In this layer, we convert the concrete values of temperature and humidity into blurred values using the blurred sentences and linguistic variables that the external processor has seen in Section 3.1. The external processor has blurred rules that are applied to the previously obtained blurred values that represent the outside temperature and humidity. These blurred rules are presented in Table 1. With these blurred rules, we obtain the degree of truth of any linguistic variable for the apparent temperature. After applying the blurred rules and obtaining the center of gravity, we obtain a value for the obvious temperature. With this value and the room temperature system, we obtain the degree of truth of any linguistic variable for the apparent temperature."}, {"heading": "3.2.3. Actuators", "text": "The last layer consists of actuators that are interconnected like heating systems and air conditioners, although more actuators may be available, such as fans, LEDs, thermostats or others. The aim of this layer is to direct the actions to the corresponding actuators. If the decision in the data processor layer was, for example, to turn on the heating system, the actuator layer should have turned on the heating system."}, {"heading": "4. Used software and hardware", "text": "The developed system language is Java 8 and uses the libraries jFuzzy-Logic1 [38, 39], Pi4J 1.02 and Gson 2.3.13.

Evaluation and discussion", "text": "This paper proposes to control the temperature in an automated and efficient way, which turns the outside temperature on and off if the temperature is higher or lower than a certain value, which is set manually. Meanwhile, a thermostat could be set to lower the temperature. The problem is that the temperature changes around 20 \u00b0 C (e.g. between 19 \u00b0 C and 21 \u00b0 C) because the system turns on and off constantly. The use of fuzzy sets and linguistic variables allows us to determine areas where the temperature is appropriate. In addition, we are able to determine the best moment to turn on heating systems and air conditioners."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "The future of computers is related to the IoT, and any progress is very important for the development of technologies from the IoT context. In this paper, we presented our approach to integrating fuzzy logic into the IoT context. We proposed the use of fuzzy logic to control the temperature of a certain room taking into account external conditions, in particular the outside temperature and humidity, in order to maintain the outside temperature. In order to maintain the outside temperature, we needed devices that could analyze the environment, which could be part of a Smart City or Smart Town, or part of a series of nearby Smart Cities and Smart Towns.With this data, the prototype developed simulates the control of the heating system and air conditioning, so that they can be switched on and off taking into account the combination of outside temperatures and indoor temperature.When evaluating our proposal, we realized that using fuzzy logic helps us to save energy and thus save money."}, {"heading": "7. Future work", "text": "The aim of this research was to achieve an initial approach that combines IoT technologies and fuzzy logic to improve temperature control in specific locations, and from here there is much work to be done in future research. \u2022 Improving the fuzzy logic configuration: The configuration used in this paper is based on our experience during research progress. Improving this configuration would allow for better results, save more energy and achieve better temperature control. \u2022 Saving old temperatures to know whether the temperature is rising or falling: the actual approach does not take into account temperature evolution in indoor environments. Knowing the previous temperatures helps the system make better decisions. System behavior cannot be the same when the temperature rises or falls. Taking into account the temperature progression could help to avoid a constant change in state. \u2022 Publishing the data in IoT platforms: In this research, we obtain the outdoor temperature by combining the outside temperature and the humidity to make the system a good contribution."}, {"heading": "8.

through fields already known like Smart Homes, Smart Cities, or Smart Towns. The monitoring of environmental conditions of cities can help to adapt the indoor locations of the cities in order to be more comfortable for people who stay there. A way to improve the indoor conditions is an efficient temperature control, however, it depends on many factors like the different combinations of outdoor temperature and humidity. Therefore, adjusting the indoor temperature is not setting a value according to other value. There are many more factors to take into consideration, hence the traditional logic based in binary states cannot be used. Many problems cannot be solved with a set of binary solutions and we need a new way of development. Fuzzy logic is able to interpret many states, more than two states, giving to computers the capacity to react in a similar way to people. In this paper we will propose a new approach to control the temperature using the Internet of Things together its platforms and fuzzy logic regarding not only the indoor temperature but also the outdoor temperature and humidity in order to save energy and to set a more comfortable environment for their users.
