These representations have proven useful in many NLP applications, including answering questions (Shen and Lapata, 2007) and information extraction (Christensen et al., 2011). Semantic banks (e.g. PropBank et al., 2005) typically represent arguments as syntactical components or, more generally, text spans (Baker et al., 1998). In contrast, the CoNLL-2008 and 2009 are shared tasks (Surdeanu et al., 2008; Hajic et1github.com / diegma-dep-srlal."}, {"heading": "2 Our Model", "text": "The focus of this paper is on the identification and labeling of arguments, as these are the steps previously thought to require syntactical information. To clarify predicates, we use a simple LSTM model described in Section 2.4. To identify and classify arguments, we use a bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM). LSTM takes input word representations xi of each word wi in a sentence w. LSTM states provide a dynamic representation of words and their contexts in a sentence. Actual prediction of roles is done by a classifier that uses the BiLSTM representation of the candidate argument and the BiLSTM representation of the predicate as input."}, {"heading": "2.1 Word Representation", "text": "We represent each word w as a concatenation of three vectors: a randomly initialized word embedding xre-Rdw, a pre-trained word embedding xpe-Rdw, a randomly initialized part-of-speech tag embedding xpos-Rdp, and a randomly initialized lema embedding xle-Rdw, which is only active when the word is one of the predicates. Randomly initialized embedding xre, xpos, and xle are fine-tuned during training, while the pre-trained ones remain fixed. Final word representation is given by x = xre-xpe-xpos-xle, representing the concatenation operator."}, {"heading": "2.2 Bidirectional LSTM Encoder", "text": "One of the most effective ways to model sequences are recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Elman, 1990), more precisely their gated versions, for example Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).Formally, we can define an LSTM as a function LSTM\u03b8 (x1: i), which takes the sequence x1: i as input and returns a hidden state hi-Rdh. This state can be considered a representation of the sentence from beginning to position i, or, in other words, it encodes the word at position i together with its left context. Bidirectional LSTMs use two LSTMs: one for the forward pass and another for the backward pass, LSTMF and LSTMB, respectively. Thus, the concatenation of forward and backward LSTM states is an argument that defines both the left and right contexts of a word, BiSTM."}, {"heading": "2.3 Predicate-Specific Encoder", "text": "Although this one-pass model, in which the sentence is encoded only once, is very effective for analyzing syntactic dependencies, it does not perform well in SFL (Table 3, \"predicate flag\"). Although we found this dramatic drop in performance surprising, the nature of the dependencies, especially in nominal predicates, differs here from predicates. Inspired by the Spanish SFL approach of Zhou and Xu (2015), we add a predicate-specific feature to the word representation by assigning a binary flag to the word representation in Section 2.1. The flag is set to 1 for the word that corresponds to the predicate currently being considered, and 0 otherwise. Thus, sentences with more than one predicate are encoded multiple times."}, {"heading": "2.4 Predicate Disambiguation", "text": "We also implemented a syntax-agnostic predicate sense disambiguator. For this sub-task, we presented a word as a concatenation of its pre-trained word embedding, the predicate word we want to disambiguate, and the predicate flag. This word representation is fed to a single-layer BiLSTM. The concatenation of the hidden state of the predicate and the predicate word embedding is passed to a linear classifier to obtain the predicate sense. If a predicate has never been seen during training, the first sense is predicted at the test date."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "We applied our model to the English CoNLL2009 dataset with the standard division into training, test, and development groups. Similar to Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016), we used external embeddings from Dyer et al. (2015); we replaced a word with the unknown UNK token with the probability \u03b1fr (w) + \u03b1, where \u03b1 is a hyperparameter and fr (w) the frequency of the word w. We used the POS tags provided by the CoNL2009 shared task organizers. For the predicate disambiguator of Section 2.4, we used GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014), where the word w. (POS and Ba, 2015) exceeded the predictive results of POS models (POS and POS, 2015)."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions", "text": "Our syntax agnostic method is simple and fast, outperforming comparable approaches (no system combination, local conclusions) in the standard indomain benchmark for English. In addition, it outperforms all previous methods (including ensembles) in what is arguably a more realistic out-of-domain setting. In the future, we will consider integrating syntactic information and common conclusions, as well as experimenting with additional languages."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The project was supported by the European Research Council (ERC StG BroadSem 678254), the Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO VIDI 639,022,518) and an Amazon Web Services (AWS) grant.
