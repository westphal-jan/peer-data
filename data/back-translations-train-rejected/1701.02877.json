Coupled with a higher incidence of unseen features more generally and the lack of large training corpora, this leads to significantly lower F1 scores for diverse genres as compared to more regular ones.

This work aims to quantify how this diversity impacts state-of-the-art NLP methodologies by measuring named entities (NE) and context variability. In particular, our findings suggest that NER's approaches struggle to generalize across genres with limited training data, particularly invisible NEs, which are more common in different genres such as social media than more regular genres such as the news wire. Together with a higher frequency of invisible features in general and the lack of large training companies, this leads to significantly lower F1 values compared to more regular genres. We also find that leading systems rely heavily on surface shapes found in training data and beyond that provide explanations for general observation problems."}, {"heading": "1.

Datasets", "text": "Since the aim of this study is to compare the performance of NER in corpora across different domains and genres, seven authoritative NER corporas are included, which include news wire, radio conversations, web content and social media (see Table 1 for details) These records were selected to be commented on with the same or very similar entity classes, in particular names of persons, places and organizations, thus excluding corpora that include only domain-specific entities (e.g. biomedical corpora), and the choice of corpora was also motivated by its chronological age; we wanted to ensure good distribution over time to investigate possible effects of the entity drift over time. 11 Entity drift is a cause of increased diversity. It occurs when the terms representing a NE category, such as \"person,\" change over time. For example, \"Yeltsin\" could be a lexicalization of a person-entity while \"textforms can be seen in a later domain.\""}, {"heading": "2.1.1.
