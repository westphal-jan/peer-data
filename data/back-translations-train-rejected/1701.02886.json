We will consider only the case of limited support. A relevant property of the Christoffel scaled function is that it encodes information about the support and density of a population measure \u00b5: \u2022 Ma'te \u0301 et al. (1991), Totik (2000) and Kroo and Lubinsky (2012) provide asymptotic results that include the density of the input measure. \u2022 Theorem 3.8 provides asymptotic results in connection with the support of input measurement. The support and density of a measure is of interest for many statistical applications. However, the above results are limited to population scales that are not accessible in a statistical context. In the context of empirical Christoffel functions, Theorem 3.11 suggests that these properties are still valid (at least in the limit of large samples) when using the empirical measurement of population size."}, {"heading": "4.2 Density estimation", "text": "Most asymptotic results with respect to the scaled Christoffel function indicate that the limiting behavior includes the product of a boundary effect concept and a density concept. Thus, if you know both the Christoffel function and the boundary effect concept, you have access to the density concept. Unfortunately, this boundary concept is known only in certain situations, the most typical example being the Euclidean ball. \u2022 Support is unknown, but contains a set of S with the same property as above. \u2212 In this case, we will consider limiting the population measurement \u00b5 to S. Note that a sample from the restriction to S and limd \u2192 s (d) exists (possibly unknown)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Support inference", "text": "Combining theorems 3.8 and 3.11 indicate that the unknown support of a population size \u00b5 can be recovered from n independent samples by swelling the scaled empirical Christoffel function. In this section, we set \u00b5 as a uniform probability quantity over a star-shaped domain in R2 (see Figure 2). For different values of degree d and range n, we plot the corresponding sample and the corresponding level quantity {x-R2: s (d) \u00b5n, d (x) = \u03b1 (g)}, where \u03b4 = 0.5 and \u03b1 are given in assumption 3.6. The results shown in Figure 2 show that for well-chosen values of d and \u03b1 as in assumption 3.6, the support of the population size is approximated fairly well from a finite independent sample."}, {"heading": "4.4 Outlier detection", "text": "In Lasserre and Pauwels (2016), we suggested that the empirical Christoffel function could be used for the purpose of detecting outliers, and the claim was supported by some numerical experiments.The rationale for this is that the Christoffel empirical function can be considered population density and outlier information as samples from low density areas. We follow the same line and consider the network intrusion detection task presented in Williams et al. (2002) based on the KDD Cup 99 datasets (Lichman, 2013).After pre-processing performed in Williams et al. (2002); Lasserre and Pauwels (2016), we build up five datasets consisting of network connections represented by marked vectors in R3, where each connection may or may not be an attack.

Furthermore, we know that there is an invertible affine mapping A-Rp-Rp, so that after a potential permutation of columns A, there is a division between the columns of X-Rp and those of X. The problem is to restore the correspondence between the columns of X-Rp and the columns of X-Rp, whence the name \"affine inversion\" comes from. Note that the columns can be mixed at will and therefore the matching problem is not trivial. In this setting, we can use the affine inventory property of the Christoffel function described in Theorem 3.5. This is based on the two following observations. \u2022 The Christoffel function depends only on the empirical moments and is therefore not sensitive to the rearrangement of the column values. \u2022 The work with the image."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we examined the potential of the Christoffel empirical function for some applications in statistics and machine learning, and this question led us to examine its theoretical properties as well as possible paths towards application, largely within a statistical framework. On the theoretical side, we have proposed two main contributions: the first provides an explicit threshold scheme that enables us to regain support for a measure with strong asymptotic guarantees. Although this property is rooted in the long history of results in terms of asymptotic properties of Christoffel function, we have created a systematic way to adjust the threshold and degree of convergence guarantees; the second main contribution relates the Christoffel empirical function to its population counterpart. This type of results is new and paves the way to a much more precise understanding of the relationships between these two objects in a small sample environment. On the practical side, we have presented the relevance of the Christoffel function as a practical tool in a particular context."}, {"heading": "6.

Similarly, Lemma 6.6 is valid with \u00b5 instead of \u00b5S, in fact the proof uses only the fact that \u00b5S is a probability measure based on S, which is also valid for \u00b5.
