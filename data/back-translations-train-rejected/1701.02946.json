Most previous research has focused on inducing and evaluating models from the English RST Discourse Treebank. However, discourse treebanks for other languages exist, including Spanish, German, Basque, Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese. The treebanks share the same underlying linguistic theory, but differ slightly in the way documents are annotated. In this paper, we present (a) a new discourse parser which is simpler, yet competitive (significantly better on 2/3 metrics) to state of the art for English, (b) a harmonization of discourse treebanks across languages, enabling us to present (c) what to the best of our knowledge are the first experiments on cross-lingual discourse parsing.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 12:16:25 GMT  (35kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02946v1", "To be published in EACL 2017, 13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "To be published in EACL 2017, 13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chlo\\'e braud", "maximin coavoux", "anders s{\\o}gaard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.02946"}, "pdf": {"name": "1701.02946.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Cross-lingual RST Discourse Parsing", "authors": ["Chlo\u00e9 Braud", "Anders S\u00f8gaard"], "emails": ["braud@di.ku.dk", "soegaard@di.ku.dk", "maximin.coavoux@etu.univ-paris-diderot.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "For example, the three discourse units below can be represented by the tree in Figure 1, in which there is a COMPARISON relationship between segments 1 and 2, and a relationship ATTRIBUTION connects the segment covering units 1 and 2, and segment 3.11 consumer spending in the UK increased by 0.1% in the third quarter and was 3.8% higher than a year ago.1 \"NS\" and \"NN\" in Figure 1 describe the nuclear nature of the segments, see Section 3.Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is a prominent linguistic theory of discourse structures, in which texts are analyzed as constituency trees."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The first text-level discourse savers were developed for English and are mainly based on handmade rules and heuristics (Marcu, 2000a; Carlson et al., 2001). Hernault et al. (2010, HILDA) greedily use SVM classifiers to make binding and labeling decisions, and build a discourse tree. Joty et al. (2012, TSP) build a two-step parsing system by forming separate sequential models (CRF) for the intra- and inter-entential levels. These models jointly learn the relationship and structure, and a CKY-like algorithm is used to find the optimal tree. Feng and Hirst (2014) use CRFs only as local models for the inter- and intra-entential levels. For Brazilian Portuguese, for example, the first system, called DiZer and Nunes, is multiple."}, {"heading": "3 RST framework", "text": "Discourse Analysis When building a discourse structure, the text is first divided into elementary discourse units (EDUs), usually clauses. EDUs are the smallest discourse units (DUs). Discourse relationships are then used to form DUs, recursively. A non-elementary DU is called a complex discourse unit (CDU). The structure of a document is the set of associated DUs. In this paper, we focus on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), a theoretical framework proposed by Mann and Thompson (1988). Nuclear A DU is either a nucleus or a satellite, with the nucleus being the most important part of the relationship (i.e. the text), while the satellite contains additional, less important information. Generally, this feature depends on the relationship: a relationship can be either mono-nuclear (with a scheme nuclear satellite or satellite nucleus, depending on the relative order of the spans) or multi-nuclear."}, {"heading": "4 Data", "text": "We test our discourse saver in six languages and use available RST corpora, which are harmonized as described in Section 4.2.

Discourse segmentators can be built relatively easily by relying only on manual rules, as is the case with the Spanish and Portuguese, especially considering that the segmentations in the corpora built up after the En-DT (Vliet et al., 2011) have generally been made more coarse."}, {"heading": "5.1 Description of the Parser", "text": "We used the syntactic parser described in Coavoux and Crabbe \u0301 (2016) in the static oracle setting. We chose this parser because it can take upstream embedding as input and, more importantly, because it is designed for morphologically rich languages and therefore uses as input not only tokens and POS tags, but any token attribute that is then mapped to a real vector that allows the use of complex traits. The parser is a transit-based constituent parser that uses a lexicalized shift-reducing transition system (Sagae and Lavie, 2005). The transition system is based on two data structures - a stack (S) partially stores trees and a queue (B) constituting parser that uses a lexicalized shift-reducing transition system (Sagae and Lavie, 2005). The transition system based on two data structures is a parcel (S) with a wait structure < S (S) partially stores a wait structure."}, {"heading": "5.2 Cross-lingual Discourse Parsing", "text": "Our initial experiments are strictly monolingual, and they are designed to provide state-of-the-art performance in a fully monitored environment. We take into account that we need at least 100 documents to build a monolingual model, as we already have about 65 documents for testing and development. We then evaluate methods of multi-source transfer, considering one language as the target and the others as the source. Two settings are evaluated more precisely: (1) training and optimization based only on the available source data; (2) training all available data, including the target data if necessary, and optimizing the target language development set. Setting (1) provides performance when no data is available in the target language at all, while (2) aims to assess whether improvements can be expected by simply combining all available data. When combining the company, we cannot ignore lexical information, as it is used for syntactical parsing with delicalized models (McDonald et al, 2011)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Features", "text": "As in previous studies, we used features that represent the two EDUs at the top of the stack, and the EDU in the queue. < When the stack contains CDUs, we use the nuclear principle to select the head EDU, which transforms multinuclear relationships into nuclear-satellite relationships, as has been the case since (Sagae, 2009). However, we found that this information is also used for the left and right children of the two CDUs at the top of the stack, and that the representation built for these two CDUs leads to important improvements. Lexical features We use the first three words and the last word along with their POS, features that have proven useful for discourse (Pitler et al., 2009), and the words in the header set (Sagae, 2009) - i.e. words whose head is not included in the EDU in the dependency graph - here limited to the first triangles."}, {"heading": "6 Experiment settings", "text": "rE's, he says, \"it's like we're able to unite.\" (mA) D \"i\" n \"n, he says,\" i sasd \"s\" i \"n.\" (mA \"n\" i \"n,\" i \"s\" s \"s.\" (\"D\" n \"s\" s \"s\" s. \"(\" D \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s.\") D \"n\" i \"s.\" (D \"n\" s \"s\" s. \"s\" s. \"(D\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s.\" \"s\" s. \"(D\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s.\" \""}, {"heading": "7 Results", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "We introduced a new discourse sparser that provides state-of-the-art services for English.

The treebanks share the same underlying linguistic theory, but differ slightly in the way documents are annotated. In this paper, we present (a) a new discourse parser which is simpler, yet competitive (significantly better on 2/3 metrics) to state of the art for English, (b) a harmonization of discourse treebanks across languages, enabling us to present (c) what to the best of our knowledge are the first experiments on crosslingual discourse parsing.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
