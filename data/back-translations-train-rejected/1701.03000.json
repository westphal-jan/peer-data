The format of the knowledge stored in the Knowledge Base corresponds to the knowledge model presented in Section 2.1, and one of the possible formats is RDF / OWL. In addition, the Knowledge Base contains expert knowledge, as well as the model transformation rules used to solve argumentation problems."}, {"heading": "3 TAXONOMY OF ITS DOMAIN CONCEPTS", "text": "This section describes the objects or concepts of the ITS domain and their relationship to more general CPS domain concepts, while the concepts are organized in an ontology that has multiple levels of abstraction. We design our ontology by combining top-level concepts and cross-domain relationships borrowed from three domains: CPS; agent-based model (ABM) and Systems-of-Systems (SoS). The proposed ontology consists of an upper ontology that includes the concepts and relationships of the CPS, ABM and SoS, as well as a general ITS domain ontology. First, the general ITS domain ontology can be further related to ontologies that instantiate transport domain-specific transitions and states, as described in Section 4.The goal of splitting the ontology into multiple levels is twofold. This approach allows different levels of properties, attributes and concepts to be less abstract and present-level concepts, while the lower levels are more abstract and concepts."}, {"heading": "3.1 Upper Ontology", "text": "They have a central role to play in promoting interoperability between regions."}, {"heading": "3.2 ITS Domain Ontology", "text": "With the support of the presented upper ontology model, we propose in this section an ITS-specific ontology as illustrated in Figure 6. One of the central concepts within the ITS area is the transport agent, which extends the agent from the upper ontology. The transport agent, in turn, comprises agents capable of transporting a unit, from physical goods to virtual data. Some important concepts from the upper layers that apply to the transport agent include dynamics and capacity. Transport agents, in turn, are closely related to the abstract concept of transport mode, which defines the type of transport scenario (e.g. roads, rails, telco).Another important concept is the transport infrastructure, which encompasses all elements required by a transport mode, such as routes, rails and transport networks. Most elements within the transport infrastructure are extensions of graph, arc and node, abstract concepts from the upper ontology, a transport mode, such as routes, within a transport mode, and transport mode are required."}, {"heading": "4 IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "5 EVALUATION", "text": "In this area, we are able to assess some aspects of the system (e.g. efficiency, performance, etc.), but what we are doing instead is extending the functionality of the system by supporting it."}, {"heading": "6 RELATED WORK", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of them are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

The motivation behind creating a generating traffic planner and KMARF is to show that knowledge and methods can be reused in various areas to reduce the costs of developing, deploying and operating such systems. We have illustrated the use of parts of KMARF to generate traffic planning that can be used to quickly design shift plans for vehicle fleets. Currently, there are many different abstractions in the literature for dealing with complex real systems, including agent-based models, and systems, and systems that are accompanied by technology."}], "references": [{"title": "either the system knows how to proceed with further reductions or declares the problem as intractable under its current knowledge", "author": ["R.
