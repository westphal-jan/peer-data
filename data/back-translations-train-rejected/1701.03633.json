In many application scenarios, predictive maintenance is applied to a set of homogeneous appliances. In this paper, we firstly review taxonomies and main methodologies currently used for condition-based maintenance; secondly, we argue that the mutual dissimilarities of the behaviours of all appliances of this set (the \"cohort\") can be exploited to detect upcoming faults. Specifically, inspired by dissimilarity-based representations, we propose a novel machine learning approach based on the analysis of concurrent mutual differences of the measurements coming from the cohort. We evaluate our method over one year of historical data from a cohort of 17 HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems installed in an Italian hospital.
