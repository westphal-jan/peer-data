We do so by tracking entities that emerge in public discourse, that is, in online text streams such as social media and news streams, before they are incorporated into Wikipedia, which, we argue, can be viewed as an online place for collective memory. By tracking how entities emerge in public discourse, i.e., the temporal patterns between their first mention in online text streams and subsequent incorporation into collective memory, we gain insights into how the collective remembrance process happens online. Specifically, we analyze nearly 80,000 entities as they emerge in online text streams before they are incorporated into Wikipedia. The online text streams we use for our analysis comprise of social media and news streams, and span over 579 million documents in a timespan of 18 months. We discover two main emergence patterns: entities that emerge in a \"bursty\" fashion, i.e., that appear in public discourse without a precedent, blast into activity and transition into collective memory. Other entities display a \"delayed\" pattern, where they appear in public discourse, experience a period of inactivity, and then resurface before transitioning into our cultural collective memory.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Jan 2017 13:34:43 GMT  (1042kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04039v1", "37 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "37 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["david graus", "daan odijk", "maarten de rijke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.04039"}, "pdf": {"name": "1701.04039.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Birth of Collective Memories: Analyzing Emerging Entities in Text Streams", "authors": ["David Graus", "Daan Odijk", "Maarten de Rijke"], "emails": ["dpgraus@gmail.com,", "daan@blendle.com,", "derijke@uva.nl"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We discover two essential patterns of origin: entities that emerge in an \"inflated\" manner, i.e., that occur in public discourse without precedent, enter into activity and pass into collective memory.

The notion of a \"shared pool of knowledge and information in the memories of a social group\" depends on the framework of a group in a society. Since its introduction, the concept has been examined in a variety of interdisciplinary fields, primarily in literature, history and the media [8, 37], but also in (experimental) psychology [20, 41, 51] e.g. by emperatively examining the performance of remembering events of different members of a single social group [5]. Wikipedia was initially designated as a global repository where collective memories by Pentzold [38] are built, with follow-up studies by Keegan [25] and Ferron and Massa [11] shortly thereafter. As Ferron [10, p. 23] puts it, Wikipedia's \"discussion processes and article constructions are to be regarded as discursive formation of memory or in other terms, as a transition from a communicative memory that is active, empirical and specialized."}, {"heading": "2.2 Growth and development of Wikipedia", "text": "Previous work exploring the expansion of Wikipedia by adding new pages examines the phenomenon from the perspective of Wikipedia itself, e.g. by analyzing how newly created articles fit into Wikipedia's semantic network, examining the relationship between conversation page activity and the addition of new content to articles, or by examining controversies and disagreements about new content through \"editing wars.\" [24, 26, 52, 53] The study of emerging entities has received considerable attention from natural language processing and information retrieval communities. Specifically, different methods and systems for identifying and linking unknown or emerging entities have been proposed [21, 29, 35, 48]. Graus et al. [16] investigate the problem of predicting new concepts in social flows. More recently, Fa \ufffd rber et al.

To investigate these origin patterns, we create a custom dataset of timestamped documents that is retrospectively referenced to Wikipedia, including for each link (i) the creation date of the associated Wikipedia page, and (ii) whether the Wikipedia page existed at the time the document was created. Our dataset includes 7.3 million documents with 36.2 million references to 79,482 unique entities. We create this dataset by adding an additional dataset to an existing document stream stream dataset (TREC KBA StreamCorpus 20143) with annotations to Freebase (FBA14)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Emerging entities in news and social media", "text": "Our dataset is derived from the TREC KBA StreamCorpus 2014, a dataset of around 1.2 billion timestamped documents from various sources, such as blog and forum posts and news broadcasts, covering 572 days (or about 18 months) from 7 October 2011 to 1 May 2013 (line 1 in Table 1). StreamCorpus consists of several subgroups, with slightly different periods and volumes (i.e. number of documents).All documents in the corpus that were automatically written as in English were automatically tagged with the serif tagger [4] and yielded approximately 580M tagged documents. This commented subset of documents was the official collection for the TREC Knowledge Base Acceleration (KBA) task in 2014 [14]. Dalton et al.

The resulting record, FAKBA1, extended by the entity timestamp and the entity, is called FAKBAT (Freebase Annotations of TREC KBA 2014 Stream Corpus with Timestamps), see line 3 in Table 1. As a next step, we filter only documents that contain aspiring entities. Aspiring entities are entities with eage < 0, i.e. entities mentioned in documents dated before the entity's creation date on Wikipedia.

[5] Freebase provides mappings to Wikipedia and its structured counterpart DBpedia. In the ontology of DBpedia, an entity is mapped to one or more classes in a tree-like class structure. We assign each of our aspiring entities to the classes assigned in DBpedia, e.g. to the entity Barack Obama is5http: / mappings.dbpedia.org / server / ontology / classes / mapped to the person, politician, author, laureate. We extract these mappings by extracting all triples that have rdf: type property (e.g. Barack Obama < rdf: type > Person). Of the 79,482 aspiring entities in our data set, we have 39,713 class mappings (i.e., a coverage of 50.0%)."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Entity popularity", "text": "Finally, as a proxy for the popularity of an entity that we use to study the composition of clusters and the various substreams in Section 6.3, we extract Wikipedia page view statistics. Specifically, we extract the total number of page views that each entity received in 2015. We opt to count page views for a year that is outside the span of our dataset to minimize the impact of actuality (i.e., we want to separate the true \"head\" entities from those that have a shorter lifespan)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Timeseries of emerging entity mentions", "text": "We are using the dataset we have created, the annotated subset of documents in TREC KBA StreamCorpus 2014, which includes emerging companies, to generate time series describing their emergence. Figure 2 shows the amount of documents over time of the various streams in our dataset. It shows a larger number of news documents compared to social media documents in the first half of the data and a larger number of social media streams compared to news documents in the second half. In total, the news stream comprises 1,836,022 documents, making it significantly smaller than the social media stream, at 5,357,014 documents. The news and social media streams themselves consist of multiple data sets from different sources [13], which explains the gap that arose around May 2012 until somewhere in July 2012. We point out that 79,482 units arise during the 18 + month (572 days) representing a span area of time from TREBA KBA Streamus 2014."}, {"heading": "5 Methods", "text": "Our first research question, Are There Common Patterns of Entities Emerging in Online Text Streams? (RQ1), revolves around the discovery of common origin patterns. We apply a time series cluster method to discover groups of entities with similar origin patterns. In this section, we first describe our time series cluster method, explain and motivate decisions to represent the time series of the emerging entity, and then describe the general methods of time series analysis that we use."}, {"heading": "5.1 Time series clustering", "text": "The clustering of time series consists of three steps: First, we need to normalize our time series, as they could encompass very different time periods; second, we measure the similarity between time series by applying a similarity metric; and third, we apply a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method to group units into groups with similar origin patterns."}, {"heading": "5.1.1 Normalization", "text": "As described in Section 4.2, the time series in our dataset may extend over different time periods and may not be temporarily aligned with each other. Therefore, we cannot rely on methods of time series analysis and modeling that use aligned time series or seasonal patterns. Furthermore, in order to visualize clusters and groups of similar time series, we can interpolate the time series linearly to have the same length [40]. Finally, since we are interested in the similarity of origin patterns, not the individual differences between popular and long-tailed units (i.e. the absolute number of mentions), we standardize all time series by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation to account for the differences in volume / popularity [46]."}, {"heading": "5.1.2 Burst similarity", "text": "Typically, time series similarity metrics are based on fixed-length time series and use seasonal or repetitive patterns [28], but as mentioned above, our time series of different lengths and timing are not aligned with each other. Therefore, common time series similarity metrics such as Dynamic Timewarping (DTW) are not applicable [3]. We are interested in the moments when attention or focus on one entity in the public discourse increases, i.e. we look for periods of higher activity. These so-called time series \"bursts\" can be correlated with real activity and events around the whole. To take into account the nature of our time series and our focus on bursts, we use BSim [46] (Burst Similarity) as a benchmark measure to compare time series. It relies on detecting bursts and using the overlap of bursts between time series as a term of similarity."}, {"heading": "5.1.3 Hierarchical agglomerative clustering", "text": "Now that we can measure similarities between time series, we need to identify clusters of similar time series. To this end, we compute the Similarity Matrix (SM) with all of the burst similarities occurring in pairs. Specifically, we first apply the L2 normalization to SM to emerging units and then convert it into a distance matrix DM (DM = 1 \u2212 SM). Next, we apply hierarchical agglomerative clusters (HAC) to DM, using the fastest cluster package [34] to detect groups of similar time series at different granularity levels. We apply Ward's method as our linkage criterion. Ward's method is an iterative approach that begins with singleton clusters and aims to merge the sample pair that reduces the maximum variance within a cluster at each successive iteration [50]."}, {"heading": "5.2 Time series analysis", "text": "In the course of this paper, we will take an exploratory approach to analyzing, visualizing, and comparing patterns of time series groups in order to discover meaningful clustering. [47] We will apply various grouping strategies, such as implicit groups as we find with our cluster method, or explicit groups, such as entities that appear either in social media or in news streams. We will apply two analytical methods to investigate different groups of time series: (i) the visualization of group signatures that represent common formation patterns within a group of time series, and (ii) the analysis of descriptive statistics that reflect properties of the underlying time series."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Visualization", "text": "To compare patterns and trends between different groups of emerging entities, we visualize and compare the so-called group signatures, i.e. the average of all time series belonging to a group. See Figure 6 below for an example of the group signatures of all emerging entities in our dataset (n = 79,482). Two challenges arise for the time series we are examining in this paper when we visualize them: First, their duration. The time series we are examining in this paper differ in length because the duration of origin differs from entity to entity. Second, their orientation. The time series are not timed because their beginning (i.e. x = 0) is marked when the entity is first mentioned in the online text stream, and end when the entity is included in Wikipedia. For these reasons, we link the time series to the (overall) longest period of origin by effectively extending them to the same length. \""}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Descriptive statistics", "text": "While studying group signatures of time series allows us to detect similar patterns and to study and compare general patterns and trends, they do not paint the complete picture. Finer-grained characteristics of origin patterns, such as the average duration of origin (the time between the first mention of a new entity in the text stream and its subsequent inclusion in Wikipedia) and the volume of origin (the total number of documents mentioning the new entity before it is included in Wikipedia), are difficult to convey by visualization alone. To examine these aspects, we present the groups of time series based on various descriptive features reflecting the emergence and bursting of time series belonging to a group."}, {"heading": "5.2.3 Chi-square goodness of fit test", "text": "In Section 6.3, we compare the distribution of entity classes per online text stream (i.e., the comparison of entity classes in the social media stream with those in the news stream).In order to assess whether the differences in these class distributions are statistically significantly different, we apply a chi-square quality test to both distributions. In addition, we classify the classes by their contribution to the difference using chi-grams, i.e. we calculate for each class: observed \u2212 expected \u221a expected, observing that the number of entities belonging to a particular class within a group (e.g. the entities appearing on social media) corresponds to the number of entities belonging to a particular class in the world population (i.e. all entities appearing in our data set)."}, {"heading": "6 Results", "text": "In this section, we present the analyses that answer our three research questions: First, we examine the time series clusters that result from our cluster method in Section 6.1; second, in Section 6.2, we examine similarities and differences between emerging patterns in social media and news streams; and, in Section 6.3, we examine the underlying entity types and their formation patterns."}, {"heading": "6.1 RQ1: Emergence patterns", "text": "The first research question we want to answer is: Are there common patterns of how entities arise in online text streams? (RQ1), is at the heart of our study on how collective memory occurs in the online world. Finding and investigating similar patterns of how an entity of communicative CM (i.e. online text streams) migrates into cultural CM (as illustrated by Wikipedia) gives us insights into the mechanism of collective memory. Our study unit is the entities that arise in communicative CM before they become part of our cultural CM. Figure 5 shows a cluster tree arising from the application of hierarchical clustering on the BSim similarity matrix, calculated for the time series of all eligible entities, as explained in Section 5.1. The tree shows a clear division into smaller clusters. At its highest level, the tree shows two distinct clusters, each of which is divided into several smaller sub-clusters."}, {"heading": "6.1.1 Global emergence pattern", "text": "First, we examine the evolution pattern of the global average by bursting the group at the root of the cluster tree (i.e., all the time series in the dataset we are in), Figure 6 shows the global evolution history, and Table 3 shows the associated statistics, and Figure 6 shows how both entities enter the public discourse (the first mention on the left side of the plot) and the subsequent incorporation into the cultural CM (the right side of the plot).

In the short time available, we refer to these clusters as subclusters. In fact, the differences between the individual sub-areas are statistically significant. In general, the differences between the individual sub-areas become significant, but also between the sub-areas. In sum, the properties of the individual sub-areas are significant."}, {"heading": "6.1.4 Summary", "text": "In this section, we answer our first research question: \"Are there common patterns of entities forming in online text streams?\" We conducted hierarchical clustering based on a burst similarity metric of emerging entity time series. We discovered two distinct emergence patterns: early bursting entities and late bursting entities. Both visual inspection of cluster signatures and analysis of descriptive time series statistics in the clusters support the same results: the EB entities are characterized by fewer but higher burst entities with shorter emergence times and lower emergence volumes. LB entities, on the other hand, appear to emerge more slowly, with a more gradual increase in exposure in the online text streams before transitioning into cultural CM. This can be seen in both the cluster signature and the descriptive statistics, which detect longer maturities, larger volumes and higher numbers of bursts."}, {"heading": "6.2 RQ2: Entity emergence patterns in social media and news", "text": "In this section, we answer our second research question: \"Do news and social media text streams show different patterns of origin?\" The news or social media document streams represent content from different sources: The news stream consists of traditional online news sources, where the content is largely written by professional journalists; the social media stream consists largely of user-generated content, consisting, for example, of forums and blog posts, but also of content shared via other social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook (via the bit.ly service \"URL Shortener\"). In the previous section, we showed that 79,482 entities appear in the combined news and social media streams. If you look more closely at these entities by splitting by stream, we find 51,095 of these entities in the news stream (i.e. they are mentioned in the news stream), similar to the number of entities appearing in the combined news and social media streams, which are mentioned in Wikipedia streams, in the second one of 14356, and finally in the second of 14356."}, {"heading": "6.2.1 Global: News vs. social", "text": "First, we compare the emerging patterns of companies in news and social media, which we have slightly compared. We apply the same hierarchical clustering method as we did in Section 6.1 about the two subgroups of companies that appear in news and social media (with nnews = 51,095 and nsocial = 51,356).Unsurprisingly, the emerging patterns in the two subgroups are broadly identical and very similar to the global patterns examined in Section 6.1. Both the news and social flows exhibit the same general global formation pattern observed by the largely similar clusters that we produce. Both flows have groups that resemble the early bursting and late bursting entities discovered in the previous section (shown in Figure 7).Figure 9 shows first the global formation patterns (top row in green), and then the LB and EB entities in the news (left) and social media (bottom two rows)."}, {"heading": "6.2.2 Who\u2019s first?", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want."}, {"heading": "6.2.3 Summary", "text": "News and social media streams broadly show similar entity formation patterns. Although the patterns may be similar, the population and behavior of entities that emerge in news and social media differ significantly. Specifically, the social media stream appears to be slower in the transition from entities from communicative to cultural CM. Taking a closer look at the interactions between the two streams, we find that entities that appear in both streams on the same day move most quickly into cultural CM. Furthermore, we find that entities that emerge first in social media are picked up more quickly in news streams than vice versa."}, {"heading": "6.3 RQ3: Emergence patterns of different entity types", "text": "In this section, we answer our third research question: \"Do different types of entities exhibit different patterns of origin?\" First, we analyze the descriptive statistics of each entity type in our dataset to determine whether different entity types exhibit different behavior in terms of their transition from communicative to cultural CM. Next, we investigate whether entity types are distributed differently across news and social media text streams."}, {"heading": "6.3.1 Entity types: temporal patterns", "text": "In fact, most people are able to decide whether they will be able to leave their country, or whether they want to leave it, to leave it."}, {"heading": "6.3.2 Entity types per stream", "text": "To determine whether the entity types observed in news and social media streams differ significantly, we apply Pearson's chi-square test, which allows us to identify entity types observed more frequently than expected in news and social media streams (i.e. global distribution). See Table 10. The majority of entity types observed more frequently in social media streams (right column of Table 10) are those we identified in the previous section as being comparatively rapid in the transition from communicative to cultural CM, e.g. DesignedArtifact, VideoGame, TelevisionShow, Software. The (average) popularity rankings from Table 9 show that 6 out of 10 entity types observed more frequently in social media are in the top 10 most popular entity types in Table 9. \"The average popularity rank of social media entity types in Table 9 shows that 6 out of 10 entity types observed more frequently in social media are more common in the top 10 most popular entity types in Table 9. The average popularity rank of social media entity types is more common in news types than in other types of smartphones (9.9)."}, {"heading": "6.3.3 Summary", "text": "In summary, we have shown that different entity types exhibit considerably different patterns of origin, but entities belonging to a particular type exhibit broadly similar patterns of origin. Furthermore, we have shown that different entity types are clearly distributed across different online text streams, which can be explained intuitively by looking at both the nature of entity types and the nature of streams. Next, we have seen that entities with a rapid transition from communicative to cultural CM are more likely to remain popular over time. Finally, we have seen that entities on social media emerge faster and remain more popular over time compared to news streams."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We summarize the work we have done, list our key findings, the implications of this work, its limitations, and identify potential future work."}, {"heading": "7.1 Summary", "text": "In this work, we examined entities in the transition from communicative to cultural collective memory by examining a large number of time series of mentions of entities in online news streams before moving to cultural CM (represented by the creation of a Wikipedia page); we examined implicit groups of similarly emerging entities by applying an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method; and explicit groups by isolating entities whether they appear in news streams or on social media."}, {"heading": "7.2 Findings", "text": "In fact, most people are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "7.3 Implications", "text": "The results in this paper have implications for the design of emerging entity recognition systems, and more generally for the study and understanding of how collective memories are formed. Firstly, we have shown that entities are likely to appear several times in public discourse (i.e., online text streams) before transitioning into cultural CM. This means that on average it takes several moments of \"exposure\" before a cultural memory develops. Furthermore, we suggest that monitoring emerging entities could serve as an effective method of predicting when they transition into cultural CM, i.e., after observing the initial outbreak, it is not too late. Furthermore, we have shown that the type of stream in which entities emerge (i.e. news and social media) contains different signals that allow us to model the process of transition process of one entity to another. Specifically, we have shown how entities that act in the two simultaneous streams of communication from one entity to another, never move from one to the other to the other."}, {"heading": "7.4 Limitations", "text": "Our study has several limitations."}, {"heading": "7.4.1 Clustering", "text": "Some of our results stem from the clusters that serve as a starting point for the discovery of common patterns, similarities and differences in formation patterns. Clustering and the study of cluster signatures is inherently a subjective matter [47]. Applying unattended clusters, which involves different hyperparameters, is by definition a difficult task to \"assess,\" i.e. to decide whether the resulting clusters exhibit significant differences. However, the large (standard) deviations that can be seen in descriptive statistics within clusters can indicate that there is a greater variety of different units. However, the linear interpolation step that we have taken to create time series with different lengths and relative time periods (i.e., not temporally oriented) leads to cluster signatures that result from the cluster method leading to visually discernible and statistically different patterns between clusters, which was not the case 6.2 and 6.3 signatures of the time series."}, {"heading": "7.4.2 Data", "text": "Next, the fragmented nature of the TREC-KBA StreamCorpus 2014 could not guarantee the coverage and thus the representativeness and completeness of the data. As shown in Figure 2, the data set contains a blind spot around May 2012, which can affect the time series of all emerging companies. To minimise the negative impact, we normalise all the time series by the overall volume of documentation. Furthermore, the choice of the underlying sources (which represent social media and news streams), such as popular social media channels such as Tumblr, Twitter and Facebook, is not part of the data set."}, {"heading": "7.5 Future work", "text": "This paper is a starting point for the study of the formation of collective memory. As a next step, we should take a closer look at the circumstances in which entities arise, not just at how many documents they appear in over time before moving into our collective CM, but rather at the contexts in which they are located, for example by looking at the content of the articles themselves. Furthermore, in this essay we have chosen to limit ourselves to the entities that transitions into and remain in the cultural CM. Another interesting aspect of CM that does not fall within the scope of the present work is the term \"consensus.\" For example, one could examine the patterns of creation of entities that are detached from the cultural CM after the transition. Finally, the observations made in this essay could be examined in a predictive task where, for example, due to a partial time series of the entity, the task would be to predict the point at which the communication goes from the CM to the cultural Entity."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research was supported by Ahold Delhaize, Amsterdam Data Science, Blendle, the Bloomberg Research Grant Programme, the Dutch national programme COMMIT, Elsevier, the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community (FP7 / 2007-2013) under Funding Agreement No. 312827 (VOX-Pol), the ESF Research Network Program ELIAS, the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences (KNAW) under the Elite Network Shifts Project, the Microsoft Research Ph.D. Programme, the Netherlands eScience Center under Project No. 027.012.105, the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) under Project No. 727.011.005, 612.001.116, HOR-11-10, CI-14-25, 652.002.001, 612.001.551, 652.001.003, 314-98-071, the Yahoo!

We discover two main emergence patterns: entities that emerge in a \u201cbursty\u201d fashion, i.e., that appear in public discourse without a precedent, blast into activity and transition into collective memory. Other entities display a \u201cdelayed\u201d pattern, where they appear in public discourse, experience a period of inactivity, and then resurface before transitioning into our cultural collective memory.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
