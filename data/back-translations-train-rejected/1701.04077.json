In the third and final part of this work-in-progress, we want to focus on the potential unintended consequences of using ML in support of medical practice. However, we do not want to focus on the consequences of mistakes made by ML algorithms, such as those that have recently crossed the line of racial or gender-based patent discrimination. Rather, we want to focus on the unintended consequences of ML at its best when its accuracy in terms of automatic classification is at least acceptable or even comparable to that of human practitioners. This type of exercise is not entirely new: A comprehensive framework of unintended consequences (UC) was developed by Ash nearly a decade ago in relation to health IT and then applied to computer-based order."}, {"heading": "9 Barr, A.

He is a physician who can use a wide set of advanced techniques in medical imaging like X-rays, CT, and MRI examinations to diagnose patients with many types of illness. Rob is in his late forties and many believe he will soon become the head of the radiology department of the hospital: when he makes a point in a meeting, few would contradict him. Many colleagues know that they can rely on him for an informed second opinion in case they have to cope with a difficult case. Some even believe that he is the most talented and knowledgeable radiologist of the hospital. For this job, Rob earns a quite good salary: last year this was $380,000, which yet is not extraordinary for radiologists with his expertise; according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, that amount is just the median salary for physicians in his position. That notwithstanding Rob does not work to get rich. His passion for his job is genuine. To become such a radiologist, the competition for Rob had been long and fierce: after the high school, he had to get accepted for a 4-year university and then obtain a bachelor\u2019s degree with excellent medical school grades and very high university scores; then he had to collect a number of enthusiastic letters of recommendation on his attitude and competences to enter a medical school as a resident, where he practiced general medicine and surgery for one year before applying for a further 4-year training program in the field. During this latter program, Rob had to interpret, both day and night, tens of thousands of imaging studies, while also counseling patients and communicating and discussing results with his referring colleagues.
