A classifier trained in such a description is likely to greatly overestimate it. One way to counteract this is to use a classification algorithm with mechanisms to prevent over-training - e.g. a convent, since it uses weight sharing. Another possibility is to transform the initial \"raw\" voxel characteristics directly into some more suitable, \"aggregated\" characteristics. [11] The available grid-like structure of raw voxel representation is indispensable for some aggregation strategies. An example of such aggregation is a wavelength transformation of voxel data. We consider the simplest case of \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 n \u2212 statistical characteristics [11]. Suppose that a scalar voxel characteristic with a resolution of N = 2W is weighted W, the entire W W is weighted as \u2212 2W where W is W \u2212 W."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We have performed a series of classification errors simply as a fraction of the tests that measure the actual efficiency of the various strategies. [15] This collection consists of 866 mechanical parts that are divided into 3 \"superclasses.\" [17] There are 45 fine classes in their entirety (hereinafter simply referred to as classes), in particular each superclass contains a different class for objects that cannot easily be assigned to other classes of this superclass. See Fig. 4 for some examples of ESB objects. We have divided the collection into a training group of 675 objects and a test set of 191 objects that can be used in all experiments."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced and studied several voxel features inspired by integral geometry, as well as some more complex (hair and statistical) features derived from it. We have tested our features on the task of classifying ESB CAD models with gradient-enhanced trees and observed reasonably good performance. Our framework has allowed us to compare the efficiency of different features and different resolutions at which they are evaluated. In particular, we have found that within this framework the best ESB classification results were obtained with very flat, depth-2 trees, which favored high-resolution statistical features as well as some global characteristics such as the total integals of Gaussian and mean curvature. Generating complex features for high-resolution voxelization is a relatively complex and time-consuming task, so there is a certain tradeoff in classification between the use of complex features with simple predictive features (such as applied in our predictive models and in deep constellations)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The author thanks Ermek Kapushev, Alexandr Notchenko and Evgeny Burnaev for many interesting conversations."}], "references": [{"title": "3d shape histograms for similarity search and classification in spatial databases", "author": ["Mihael Ankerst", "Gabi Kastenm\u00fcller", "Hans-Peter Kriegel", "Thomas Seidl"], "venue": "In International Symposium on Spatial Databases,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Content-based retrieval of 3D models", "author": ["Alberto Del Bimbo", "Pietro Pala"], "venue": "ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM),", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Generative and discriminative voxel modeling with convolutional neural networks", "author": ["Andrew Brock", "Theodore Lim", "JM Ritchie", "Nick Weston"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1608.04236,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Vrani\u0107.

Our features include local versions of the intrinsic volumes (the usual 3D volume, surface area, integrated mean and Gaussian curvature) and a few closely related quantities. We also compute Haar wavelet and statistical distribution features by aggregating raw voxel features. We apply our features to object classification on the ESB data set and demonstrate accurate results with a small number of shallow decision trees.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
