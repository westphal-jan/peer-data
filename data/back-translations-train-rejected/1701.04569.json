During the design of such systems, the engineer/decision maker would often encounter noise factors (e.g. solar insolation and ambient temperature fluctuations) when their system interacts with the environment. In this chapter, the sizing and design optimization of the solar powered irrigation system was considered. This problem is multivariate, noisy, nonlinear and multiobjective. This design problem was tackled by first using the Fuzzy Type II approach to model the noise factors. Consequently, the Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA) (in the context of a weighted sum framework) was employed to solve this multiobjective fuzzy design problem. This method was then used to construct the approximate Pareto frontier as well as to identify the best solution option in a fuzzy setting. Comprehensive analyses and discussions were performed on the generated numerical results with respect to the implemented solution methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Jan 2017 08:52:48 GMT  (936kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04569v1", "27 pages, 12 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "27 pages, 12 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["t ganesan", "p vasant", "i elamvazuthi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.04569"}, "pdf": {"name": "1701.04569.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Multiobjective Optimization of Solar Powered Irrigation System with Fuzzy Type-2 Noise Modelling", "authors": ["T.

Currently, various issues related to the use of fossil fuels in energy systems (e.g. price fluctuations, environmental concerns and efficiency) have arisen. Therefore, the use of solar energy for irrigation of irrigation pumps has become very popular in recent studies (Helikson et al., 1991; Wong & Sumathy, 2001; Jasim et al., 2014; Dhimmar et al., 2014). The design and dimensioning of solar power systems has a strong impact on the reliability, emissions and efficiency of the system (AlAli et al., 2001). Challenges in the effective sizing of this system fall into the area of optimization, where the optimal sizing and design is achieved in order to achieve the following objectives (Shivrath et al., 2012; Carroqino al, 2009)."}, {"heading": "OVERVIEW OF TYPE-2 FUZZY LOGIC", "text": "Type 2 fuzzy sets are generalizations of conventional or Type 1 fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1975).

For low-dimensional objective spaces (n 3), metrics based on spherical and polar coordinates could be used. However, since the dimensions go beyond three (n 3) indicators, the aforementioned coordinate systems do not well define the distribution of the solution vectors (Mostaghim and Teich, 2005).In such scenarios, the SDM is highly effective for the calculation of the solution distribution. To begin with the calculation of the SDM, two types of sigma lines would have to be constructed: the first sigma lines representing the solution vectors, and the sigma lines representing the reference lines representing the indicators-univertical indicators are the reference lines (sigma lines representing the solvectors-1, the solvectors-22, the solvectors-22, the indicators-where the indicators can be solved)."}, {"heading": "COMPUTATIONAL OUTCOME & ANALYSIS", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this project is a project, which is primarily a project, which is primarily a project, which is primarily a project."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The MO design of the solar-powered irrigation system was completed using type 2 fuzzy models to represent unsafe environmental factors; the dominance of the three generated Pareto limits was evaluated and classified; the design problem was successfully reformulated using type 2 fuzzy logic to represent uncertainty in the environmental data (as shown in Table 1); new optimal individual solutions were achieved as shown in Tables 3-5; and information on the effects of uncertainty on the variations in the targets was determined and analyzed, which would prove very useful for designers working with solar-powered irrigation systems operating in unsafe (or noisy) environments; and, using diversity metrics and the aggregate target function, the quality of the solutions and the behavior of the algorithm were analyzed when these irrigation systems are operated in an unsafe (or noisy) environment."}, {"heading": "FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS", "text": "In order to solve the problem of algorithmic uncertainty, the BFA should be implemented on this design problem in the future, but by varying its initialization parameters, thus identifying the optimal parameters for solving this design problem with uncertain environmental factors. In addition, other conventional fuzzy-based approaches (Vasant et al., 2010; Ganesan et al., 2014) could be upgraded to a type 2 fuzzy framework and applied to this problem. Other forms of metaheuristic approaches, such as the use of evolutionary strategies, could be implemented for this design problem (Ganesan et al., 2015). Other metrics, such as the hypervolume indicator, could be used to measure the degree of dominance of the generated pareto-frontiers (Zitzler and Thiele, 1998). A study to rigorously determine the fuzzy parameters (Equation (3)) could be conducted to try to achieve a better modelling accuracy of this design, which would be very useful for future researchers."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The authors are very grateful to the reviewers for their efforts to provide useful and constructive insights that the author overlooked in the preparation of the manuscript.

During the design of such systems, the engineer/decision maker would often encounter noise factors (e.g. solar insolation and ambient temperature fluctuations) when their system interacts with the environment. In this chapter, the sizing and design optimization of the solar powered irrigation system was considered. This problem is multivariate, noisy, nonlinear and multiobjective. This design problem was tackled by first using the Fuzzy Type II approach to model the noise factors. Consequently, the Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA) (in the context of a weighted sum framework) was employed to solve this multiobjective fuzzy design problem. This method was then used to construct the approximate Pareto frontier as well as to identify the best solution option in a fuzzy setting. Comprehensive analyses and discussions were performed on the generated numerical results with respect to the implemented solution methods.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
