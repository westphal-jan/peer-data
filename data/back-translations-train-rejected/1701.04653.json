We experiment with predicting a wide range of 62 demographic attributes for neighbourhoods of London. We use the text from QA platform of Yahoo!

Our qualitative analysis indicates that there is semantic relatedness between the highest correlated terms extracted from both datasets and their relative demographic attributes.

The availability of an enormous amount of data from many social media platforms has inspired researchers to study the relationship between the data generated by the use of these platforms and the real attributes. Most of these platforms have made predictions in terms of predictions in many areas of the world. Many recent studies in this area have been particularly inspired by the availability of text-based social media platforms such as blogs and Twitter. Text from Twitter microblogs, in particular, has been widely used as a data source to make predictions in many areas."}, {"heading": "Datasets", "text": "The discussions may be in depth and length, but the interactions are not spontaneous; the timeframe within which users participate in a discussion thread may vary from one day to several days or even months. Furthermore, unlike Twitter and some of the other social media platforms, QA platforms are not location-specific; the responses are one of the few QA platforms that have emerged in the last ten years. Discussions in Yahoo! Answers are not domain specific and can cover a wide range of topics. Twitter is an online microblogging platform where users can post and read short 140-character messages. Twitter is mainly used to share views, opinions and messages in real time. Unlike QA platforms, Twitter is ubiquitous and can cover a variety of topics. While some users use Twitter to receive updates about the news and their social circle, many others use it as part of their daily routine to talk about their thoughts, their whereabouts or activities."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Spatial Unit of Analysis", "text": "The spatial analysis unit selected for this work is the neighborhood, which is identified by a unique name (e.g. Camden), and people usually use that name in QA discussions to refer to specific neighborhoods. A list of neighborhoods for London is taken from the GeoNames Gazetteer2, a data set of names of geographical places including place names. For each neighborhood, GeoNames provides its name and a set of geographical coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) that roughly represent its center. Note that geographical boundaries are not provided. GeoNames contains 589 neighborhoods that are within the boundaries of Greater London. For the rest of the paper, we use the terms \"neighborhood\" or \"area\" to refer to our spatial analysis unit."}, {"heading": "Pre-processing, Filtering, and Spatial Aggregation", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to go in search of a solution worthy of the name, \"he told the German Press Agency.\" It's not that we're going to get involved in a solution, \"he said.\" But it's not that we're going to get involved in a solution. \"He pointed out that it could be a solution,\" but it's not that we're going to get involved in a solution. \""}, {"heading": "Document Representation", "text": "A very popular method of representing a document using its words is the tf-idf approach (Salton, Fox and Wu 1983). Tfidf is the abbreviation for term frequency reversal frequency of a document, where tf indicates the frequency of a term in the document and idf is a function of the number of documents in which a term has appeared. In a tf-idf representation, the order of words in the document is not preserved. tf-idf value is calculated for each term in a document as follows: tf-idf (d, t) = tf (d, t) log (total number of documents containing the term t) (1) To subtract the bias for areas with a high number of QAs or tweets, we normalize tf values based on the length of each document as below. The length of a document is defined by the number of its tokens (indistinguishable words)."}, {"heading": "Correlation", "text": "To determine the extent to which the text received from the two platforms Yahoo! Answers and Twitter reflects the true attributes of the neighborhood, we first examine whether there are significant, strong and significant correlations between the terms present in each corpus and the many neighborhood attributes by the Pearson correlation coefficient \u03c1. For each term in each corpus, we calculate the correlation between the term and all selected demographic attributes. To do this, we define a vector for each term with the dimension of the number of neighborhoods. The value of each cell in this vector represents the normalized tf-idf value of the term for the corresponding neighborhood. For each demographic attribute, we also define a vector with the dimension of the number of neighborhoods. Each cell represents the value for the demographic attribute of the corresponding neighborhood. We then calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two vectors to measure the strength of the connection between each term and each attribute."}, {"heading": "Prediction", "text": "We study how well the demographic attributes can be predicted using Yahoo! Ansewrs and Twitter data. We define the task of predicting a continuously evaluated demographic attribute for invisible neighborhoods as a regression task given their normalized tf-idf document reproduction. A separate regression task is defined for each demographic attribute. We choose linear regression for the prediction tasks, as is widely used for text predictions in the literature (Foster and Stine; Joshi et al. 2010). Due to the high number of characteristics (vocabulary size) and a small number of training points, there may be overmatches. To avoid this problem, we use an elastic net regularization, a technique that combines the regularization of the mountain and lasso regressions. Parameters are estimated by minimizing the following loss function."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Note: There are many attributes across several categories in the census data. Due to space constraints, we perform most of our experiments with selected attributes based on religion (population Jewish%, population Muslim%, population Hindu%, population Buddhist%), ethnicity (population black%, population white% and population Asian% ethnicity), price (average house prices) and deprivation (multiple deprivation index, IMD5).For a full breakdown of the results, see the attachment. 5https: / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Multiple _ deprivation _ index"}, {"heading": "Correlation", "text": "The number of significantly correlated terms from Yahoo and Twitter with the selected demographic attributes is shown in Table 2. Note that the number of unique (common) words in Twitter (17k) is almost twice as high as in Yahoo! The first column shows a demographic attribute and the second column shows that the number of terms that have a significant correlation with the attributes is small; the third column (\"All\") shows the total number of terms that have a significant correlation with each attribute (p-value < 0.01); the following columns show the number of terms that have a significant correlation with the attributes in the respective areas; the last column appears to be significantly correlated with the attributes."}, {"heading": "Prediction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to go to another world, in which they are able to go to another world, in which they are able to go to another world, in which they are able to go to where they are."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The availability of an enormous amount of data from many social media platforms has inspired researchers to study the relationship between the data on these platforms and many real-world attributes. Twitter data, in particular, has been widely used as a social media source to make predictions in many areas. For example, revenue from the box office is predicted with texts from Twitter microblogs (Asur, Huberman, and others in 2010). Predictive results were predicted by conducting content analysis on tweets (Tumasjan et al. 2010). However, correlations between the state of mind of collective tweets and the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) (Bollen, Mao, and Zeng 2011) are shown to have been the focus of much research. Quercia attributes of collective tweets on the value of collective tweets (Mao, and Zeng 2011). Predictive demographics of individual users who use their language on social media platforms, especially Twitter, have been the focus of much research. Quercia attributes of collective tweets on the value of collective tweets (Mao), Industrial Average (DJIA) (DJIA) (closely)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we examine the prediction of values for real-world units, such as neighborhood demographic characteristics, using discussions on QA platforms. We show that these attributes can be predicted using text functions based on Yahoo! when answering discussions about neighborhoods with a slightly higher correlation coefficient than predictions made using Twitter data."}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "In order to unify the units of analysis, we take a heuristic approach. We do not validate our results with other approaches. This is because we lack the work to use non-geotagged text to predict neighborhood characteristics in the current literature. Our experiments in this paper are limited to the city of London. London is a cosmopolitan city and a popular destination for travelers and settlers, so there is a lot of discussion on Yahoo! Answers on neighborhoods. Reporting on discussions on QA platforms may not be sufficient for all cities of interest."}], "references": [{"title": "Predicting the future with social media", "author": ["S.
