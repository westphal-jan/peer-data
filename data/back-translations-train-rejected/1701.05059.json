Ontology concept", "text": "Ontology is an explicit formal specification of a common conceptualization of a particular area of interest [9]. It defines a complex map of relations that must be formulated in a comprehensive and rigorous conceptual scheme in order to form a knowledge base by grasping a common meaning of terms. It relies on this perspective to show information (semantically). According to [10], this form of knowledge is regarded as an intermediate representation of a conceptualization that is more formal and structured than natural language, but less formal than a formal language that makes it possible to establish a common language that can be understood and capture the accumulated knowledge. OWL is the widely accepted approach to standardizing a language for ontologies. OWL ontology consists of individuals, properties and classes. Individuals (also known as instances) represent objects within a particular domain. Properties represent relations between individuals or between individuals and data values. OWL class 8 defines the whole group of this word, meaning that the individual is divided by a certain scheme."}, {"heading": "B. The mission ontology model", "text": "In contrast, the semantic annotation of internships with concepts from a controlled vocabulary, based on semantic web technologies, enables a standardized structure of mission descriptions and thus a better correspondence between the skills of students and internships. Mission sontology is shown in Figure 1. Mission sontology is composed of many classes, which are described as follows: Location: refers to the address of mission competencies: presents the competencies required by the company. It is composed of two subclasses, Action and Domain Action.a) Action: presents the keywords (verbs) used in the one-ship.b) Domain Action: presents the domain Action: presents the area of actions.

The student profile ontology", "text": "The student profile is created by taking all information from the student. It consists of the definitions of the classes based on common attributes, focusing on information needs, access conditions, experience, competences and knowledge. In this section, we extract all the information that relates to the student from ULL, and then construct our student profile ontology model. The student information is roughly divided into many concepts, as in Figure 2. Student role: This class represents the role that a student can have, and it is composed of the undergraduate delegates. Student status: refers to the education that follows the student from ULL University. This class consists of three subclasses: VAE, Initial Training, Continuing Education. Academic information: Details of academic information such as the degree of the student and the actual academic year. Administrative information: contains the student's personal details in relation to his education, such as his first and last name, his address, his e-mail address, his academic year, his / her age, and the student's assessment degree: the student's actual grade and personal assessment information."}, {"heading": "D.
