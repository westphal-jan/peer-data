For the latter claim, two paradigmatic examples are presented: Logic Programming with Kleene semantics for modelling reasoning from information in a discourse, to an interpretation of the state of affairs of the intended model, and a neural-symbolic implementation of Input/Output logic for dealing with uncertainty in dynamic normative contexts.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Jan 2017 20:38:55 GMT  (350kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05226v1", "Submitted to the Special Issue \"Reasoning with Imperfect Information and Knowledge\" of Minds and Machines (2017)"], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 15:36:37 GMT  (360kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05226v2", "Forthcoming with DOI 10.1007/s11023-017-9428-3 in the Special Issue \"Reasoning with Imperfect Information and Knowledge\" of Minds and Machines (2017).

To this end, neural-symbolic systems are brought together to avoid their disadvantages. For our present purposes, we are particularly interested in three successive steps: the representation of the norms that formally and solidly govern a normative system in an ANN; the use of the network to achieve efficient parallel computations; and finally, the exploitation of the instantial learning capacities of ANNs to adapt the norms in the system, which should lead to a normative system capable of effectively integrating argumentation and learning capacities. In what follows, we present the basic concepts of ANNs and neural symbolic systems used in this article, with an emphasis on expanding connectionist learning and logical programming (CILP)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Input/Output Logic", "text": "As explained by Makinson and van der Torre [36], I / O logic has its origin in the study of conditional norms that express obligations under certain legal, moral, or practical codes, goals, random plans, advice, etc., either in a compelling or indirect form. If this general idea is put into formal terms, Makinson and van der Torre [37] represent rules by ordered pairs (a, x) in which the antecedent a is thought to be an input representing some state or situation, and the following x is thought to be an output representing what the rule tells us is desirable, mandatory, or whatever else stands in this situation in relation to the general motivation behind the development of I / O logic, but is also significant in our current context - norms are commonly distinguished from declarative statements. The latter carry truth values, while norms are called true or false, are meaningless."}, {"heading": "3.3 Overview of the Architecture", "text": "In fact, it is not the case that it is a way in which people in the United States and other countries such as the United Kingdom, France, France, France, France, Great Britain, Great Britain, France, Great Britain, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain,"}, {"heading": "3.4 Normative Connectionist Inductive Learning and Logic Programming", "text": "In this section, we introduce a new approach to encoding a fragment of I / O logic that does not necessarily correspond to an extended LP in ANNs. The most important intuition is that although logic programs generally do not explicitly capture the concepts of inputs and outputs, a neural symbolic system is programmed on the basis of extended logic - on a purely structural level: inputs and outputs in I / O logic correspond to the input and output levels of the ANN - and allow the representation of norms in ANN. As described above, in I / O logic norms are presented as ordered pairs of formulas (\u03b1, \u03b2). A peculiarity of I / O logic is that it has no representation of norms (i.e. identity is not an axiom). In normative reasoning, the input does not necessarily become an output: the output is interpreted as what is attainable, i.e. it is only an intuition."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to be able to try to find a solution that is capable, in which we have to try to find a solution, in order to find a solution for a solution."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank the following people for their indispensable contributions to various parts of the work reported in this article: Guido Boella, Silvano Colombo Tosatto, Valerio Genovese, Laura Martignon, Alan Perotti and Alexandra Varga."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change: Partial meet contraction and revision functions", "author": ["C.E.
