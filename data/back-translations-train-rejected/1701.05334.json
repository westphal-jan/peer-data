Introduction", "text": "Most of these systems are designed for short-term communication and are unable to collect all traffic-related data before entering high-risk areas, wasting time and fuel. As a solution, accurate information is needed that can be quickly used to identify risky spots and activities. However, due to the wonderful trends in interpersonal organization over the past decade, networking platforms such as the various community blogs and online forums have changed the way people live in the city."}, {"heading": "2. Related works", "text": "The goal of this system is to extract and connect various types of data processing and useful traffic information from social networks. Increasing the amount of traffic-related data on the Internet has made the task of IT systems more difficult. Currently, ITSs monitor every corner of the transportation system within the reach of a sensor network. These sensor networks are based on systems that cannot collect precise information related to traffic. In addition, people use small devices in vehicles to securely retrieve information. These devices can collect short-term information but are unable to retrieve all traffic-related data. As a solution, intelligent work is needed to automatically extract and calculate traffic data and provide meaningful information. This can improve traffic safety, can congestion large cities, and can provide comfortable travel in urban areas. A lot of research has been conducted on this topic, and several ideas have been proposed for vehicular networks (Whaiduamal)."}, {"heading": "3.

Fuzzy ontology-based semantic knowledge", "text": "It is written in a special language called Web Ontology Language (OWL). In order to achieve efficiency for the proposed ontology, a classical ontology was developed using Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 OWL. A blurred OWL plug-in was then used to transform classical ontology into a blurred ontology (Bobillo et al., 2011). The blurred OWL plug-in is used to enforce blurred terms in ontology. Classes, instances, concepts and axioms of a classical ontology and a blurred ontology are the same. However, all conceptual values of a classical ontology are blurred terms that cannot deal with uncertainty. A blurred ontology is generally defined to express vague knowledge through blurred concepts."}, {"heading": "5.

After retrieval of tweets and ratings, the precision rate of tweet ratings is very low. Therefore, a support vector rating engine (SVM) is used to identify associated ratings and tweets, while independent functions are removed (Ali et al., 2016). N-gram techniques are used to extract features from tweet sets. Bigram and Trigram refer to the extraction of two and three adjacent feature words, respectively, and bigram and Trigram features are presented in Fig 4. The proposed system employs specific functions to identify the value of each tweet is greater than 0, indicating that the tweet value is related to a transport or city function."}, {"heading": "5.3 SentiWordNet scoring and polarity interval in the ontology", "text": "SentiWordNet finds the initial value of the corresponding opinion words. SentiWordNet is a lexical resource in which each word is associated with three numerical values: positive, objective and negative (Baccianella et al., 2010). These values show how much the terms included in the synthesis are positive, neutral or negative. The opinion word clean is used as an adverb and its SentiWordNet value is 0.5, which is its linguistic value in ontology. The interval for each output is as follows: the strongly positive interval is [0.75-1], the positive is [0.5-0.75], the neutral is [0.5], the negative is [0.25-0.5] and the strongly negative interval is [0.0-0.25].

Conclusion", "text": "This paper proposes a framework of blurred ontology-based sentiment analysis of transportation and city function analyses, as it can facilitate unclear reviews of tweets and travelers. Various reasonable topics are considered, including feature extraction, opinion extraction, assertion of feature polarity in ontology, and polarity determination using blurred logic. The proposed technology provides a transportation system that determines real-time traffic mapping and provides travelers with a city characteristic map so they can plan ahead of travel. In fact, the proposed technology successfully and intelligently categorizes highly obscure assessments of traffic and city characteristics polarity. This system can automatically collect all traffic data and analyze that data to notify drivers before they reach high-risk areas that save time and fuel. It can also improve road safety, solve traffic problems in large cities, and provide convenient travel experiences to travelers in urban areas."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This research was supported by a scholarship (12-TI-C01) from the Advanced Water Management Research Program funded by the Korean Government's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport."}], "references": [{"title": "Opinion mining based on fuzzy domain ontology and Support Vector Machine: a proposal to automate online review classification", "author": ["F.

The optimum solution for this kind of problem is analyzing the information available on social network platforms and performing sentiment analysis. On the other hand, crisp ontology-based frameworks cannot extract blurred information from tweets and reviews; therefore, they produce inadequate results. In this regard, this paper proposes fuzzy ontology-based sentiment analysis and semantic web rule language (SWRL) rule-based decision-making to monitor transportation activities (accidents, vehicles, street conditions, traffic volume, etc.) and to make a cityfeature polarity map for travelers. This system retrieves reviews and tweets related to city features and transportation activities. The feature opinions are extracted from these retrieved data, and then fuzzy ontology is used to determine the transportation and city-feature polarity. A fuzzy ontology and an intelligent system prototype are developed by using Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 web ontology language (OWL) and Java, respectively. The experimental results show satisfactory improvement in tweet and review analysis and opinion mining.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
