Existing research tends to solve such sub-tasks separately, but ignore the close relation between them. In this paper, we present a joint framework incorporating logical relation between sub-tasks to improve the performance of argumentation structure generation. We design an objective function to combine the predictions from individual models for each sub-task and solve the problem with some constraints constructed from background knowledge. We evaluate our proposed model on two public corpora and the experiment results show that our model can outperform the baseline that uses a separate model significantly for each sub-task. Our model also shows advantages on component-related sub-tasks compared to a state-of-the-art joint model based on the evidence graph.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Jan 2017 09:32:08 GMT  (806kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05343v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhongyu wei", "chen li", "yang liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.05343"}, "pdf": {"name": "1701.05343.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Joint Framework for Argumentative Text Analysis Incorporating Domain Knowledge", "authors": ["Zhongyu Wei", "Chen Li", "Yang Liu"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 1.05 343v 1 [cs.C L] 19 Jan 2017"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, we are in a position to be able to unite. \""}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "rE \"s tis,\" so he asgt. \"nI eeirwde rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide nlrgne\u00fceaeFnln, eeirdw,\" eerwg os os os, rf\u00fc os rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the nlrdteeeaeFnlrteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeF\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fcteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"}, {"heading": "3 Framework of ILP-based Joint Model", "text": "The overall framework of our common reasoning mining model is in Figure 2.

We compared three approaches to this corpus. - Separately: the basic approach of (Peldszus and Stede, 2015b), which we newly implemented. - MST: We implemented the evidence-graph-based approach of (Peldszus and Stede, 2015b).

Both common models (MST and ILP) can improve performance via separate baseline for all sub-tasks (except MST for Fu), and the improvements are significant 3 in terms of macro-F1.

We use the strategy proposed in this experiment (Peldszus and Stede, 2015b). We artificially improved the classification result of a sub-task by overwriting a percentage of its predictions with the basic truth. Overwritten samples are randomly selected and the selection process is higher than the original base classifier, regardless of whether the base classifier has already chosen the correct label. The simulation result can be seen in Figure 3. The figure shows the F score on the Y-axis for all sub-tasks when the improvement percentage on the top of the base classifier for a task is varied (x-axis). Each sub-figure shows the simulation results in improving the relevant task.

As we can see, the performance of the component classification is greatly improved by a better classification of the relationships. However, the effect of a better classification of the components on the identification of the relationships is small. This is because the role of each component can be easily identified. In contrast, even the classification of the components is perfect, the identification of the relationship between them is still difficult. Furthermore, the low performance of the subtask to identify the basic relationship is also important. We also evaluate the effect of different weight combinations in the same way as with the microtext corpus. The result shows that for larger components, the performance of the classification is generally higher; the influence of \u03b1 on the relation classification is lower. This could be because the base performance for the relation classifier is low. Due to the length limit, we did not show an illustration here.The result is in Figure 5. The higher v, the greater the contribution to the common classification, the greater the greater the influence of the common component on the common classification is, the smaller the impact on the common component is on the common component."}, {"heading": "6 Summary and Future Work", "text": "Our ILP-based approach is superior to the existing graphical model because it can work on all types of data sets without requiring a tree structure as input, and because it can use more common information represented by constraints, especially for component-based tasks. There are two interesting directions for future research. First, we will look at other types of argumentative texts that have more noise and an even more complicated argumentation structure, such as posts from online discussion forums.

We design an objective function to combine the predictions from individual models for each sub-task and solve the problem with some constraints constructed from background knowledge. We evaluate our proposed model on two public corpora and the experiment results show that our model can outperform the baseline that uses a separate model significantly for each sub-task.
