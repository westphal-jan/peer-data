Today, there are several Sentiment Analyzers in the literature (Liu and Zhang, 2012). Recent papers such as Kouloumpis et al. (2011), Agarwal et al. (2011) and Barbosa and Feng (2010) attempt to perform such analyses on user-generated content. Sentiment Analysis remains a hard problem, as summarized below, due to the challenges it presents at various levels."}, {"heading": "1.1 Lexical Challenges", "text": "Mood analysts face three challenges on the lexical level: (1) data economy, i.e. the handling of invisible words / phrases. (2) Lexical ambiguity, i.e. the search for appropriate senses of a word in light of context (e.g. his face fell when he fell from the team against the boy from the bicycle, where the verb \"fell\" must be unique.) (3) Domain dependency, which deals with words that change polarity between domains. (e.g. the word unpredictably positive in case of an unpredictable film in the film sector and negative in case of unpredictable steering in the automotive sector.) Several methods have been proposed to address the different lexical difficulties by - (a) using WordNet synsets and word cluster information when lexical ambiguity and data economy (Akkaya al, Popain, 2009; Balali et al, 2011; al, 2011; al, al; Saamal, 2012)."}, {"heading": "1.2 Syntactic Challenges", "text": "Difficulties at the syntax level arise when the given text follows a complex phrase structure and phrase appendages are likely to be dissolved before SA is executed. For example, the sentence requires a somewhat roughly constructed but riveting, questioning look at a person who is so plagued by self-loathing that he becomes the enemy of his own race. It must be processed at the syntactical level before analyzing the mood. Approaches to using syntactic properties of text include generating dependency-based rules for SA (Poria et al., 2014) and using local dependency (Li et al., 2010)."}, {"heading": "1.3 Semantic and Pragmatic Challenges", "text": "This corresponds to the difficulties encountered in the higher layers of the NLP, i.e. semantic and pragmatic layers. Challenges in these layers include: (a) implicit feeling (e.g. Guy becomes girl, Guy loses girl, audience falls asleep.) (b) presence of sarcasm and different Xiv: 170 1,05 581v 1 [cs.C L] January 19, 2017Forms of irony (e.g.: This is the kind of movie you go to because the theater has an air conditioner.) and (c) thwarted expectations (e.g. the acting is fine. Action sequences are top notch. Nevertheless, I consider it to be a below-average film due to its bad storyline.) Such challenges are extremely difficult to overcome with traditional NLP tools, as they require both linguistic and pragmatic knowledge."}, {"heading": "1.4 Introducing Cognitive Features", "text": "Our hypothesis is that cognitive processes in the brain are related to eye movement activities (Parasuraman and Rizzo, 2006). Therefore, taking into account eye movement patterns when reading sentimental texts can help to better address linguistic nuances. We perform a statistical classification based on different classification traits and different combinations of traits. With our extended trait set, we observe a significant improvement in the accuracy of all classifiers for two different datasets. Experiments on a carefully curated dataset suggest a significant improvement in psychopolarity."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Sentiment classification has long been standing NLP problem with both supervised (Pang et al., 2002; Benamara et al., 2007; Martineau and Finin, 2009) and unsupervised (Mei et al., 2007; Lin and He, 2009) machine learning based techniques exist for the task.Supervised approaches are popular because of their superior classification accuracy (Mullen and Collier, 2004; Pang and Lee, 2008) and in such approach, feature engineering plays an important role. Apart from the frequently used bagof-words features based on unigrams, bigrams etc. (Dave et al., 2003; Ng et al., 2006), syntactical properties (Martineau and Finin, 2009; Nakagawa et al., 2010), semantic properties (Balamurali et al., 2011) and effect of negators."}, {"heading": "3 Eye-tracking and Sentiment Analysis Datasets", "text": "We use two publicly available datasets for our experiments.

Implicit incongruence (IMPLICIT PCA), i.e. the presence of positive phrases followed by negative situational phrases (calculated using the bootstrapping technique proposed by Riloff et al. (2013). We consider the 500 most important components of these phrases to be dimension reducing in order to avoid overfitting.2. Punctuation marks (PUNC), i.e. the number of punctuation marks in the text. 3. Largest pos / neg sub-sequence (LAR), i.e. the length of the largest set of words with unaltered polarities.

Reading Facilitation (RED) i.e. Flesch Readability Ease Score of the text (Kincaid et al., 1975). The higher the score, the easier the text is to understand.2.

Multiple hyperparameters of the classifier are applied to the default values specified in Weka. We perform separately a 10-fold cross-validation of both Dataset 1 and LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) APIs. Average F scores for the class frequency-based random classifier are 33% and 46.93% for Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 with respect to Dataset 2. Classification accuracy is shown in Table 2.

Moreover, if we consider the eye characteristics solely for the ranking of the characteristics by means of chi-square test, features FC, SL, FSDH, FSDS, RSDH, and RSDS prove to be insignificant. To investigate whether the cognitive characteristics actually contribute to classifying complex output earlier than hypotesized, we repeat the experiment on a heldout data set randomly derived from data set 1.

Our system could use mobile eye trackers to observe how readers read the review, thus determining the polarity of opinion, especially when the mood is not expressed explicitly (e.g. through the use of strong polar words) in the text.

To address this, we propose to augment traditional features used for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection, with cognitive features derived from the eye-movement patterns of readers. Statistical classification using our enhanced feature set improves the performance (F-score) of polarity detection by a maximum of 3.7% and 9.3% on two datasets, over the systems that use only traditional features. We perform feature significance analysis, and experiment on a held-out dataset, showing that cognitive features indeed empower sentiment analyzers to handle complex constructs.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
