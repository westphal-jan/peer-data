(I) Relation Extraction: Decades of research in the field of information extraction have resulted in the development of tools that successfully recognize and comment on named entities (NE) and link them to entities available in the knowledge base of the background (e.g. [5, 4, 8]). In contrast, relationships between entities are perceived, marked and linked only to a limited extent. 2CEVO namespace: http: / / eventontology.org / (II) Contextual equivalence of relationships: relationships embedded in plain text can be expressed in various ways, either explicitly or implicitly."}, {"heading": "3 Requirements for CEVO", "text": "Based on these observations, we derive a set of requirements for a cognitive ontology to comment on relationships on both structured and unstructured data. Coarse-grained requirements are listed below. Requirement 1 (Relation Tagging on Textual Data) Similar to the marking of named entities in plaintext, any mention of a relationship must be recognized, normalized and tagged. Therefore, a marker is required to distinguish both ontological properties and textual relationships. Requirement 3 (Integration and arrangement of relationships in plaintegral text) requires linking textual relationships with ontological properties. To do this, an upper ontology is required to comment ontological properties and textual relationships, Requirement 3 (Integration and alignment of properties) is required."}, {"heading": "4 Levin Conceptual Hierarchy", "text": "The entries in Levin's lexical knowledge base are verb classes. For example, Figure 2 illustrates two different English verb classes (1) transformation and creation and (2) change in the state that both subsume several verbs. Members of each class (i.e. English verbs) have two properties: (i) semantically coherent and (ii) common syntactic behavior. These properties are described as follows: (i) Common Meaning: Each class of verbs has a unique set of properties that form the meaning of each verbs. In fact, the conjunction of properties offers a different meaning for each class. A single property of meaning can be attributed to several classes depending on the context. Furthermore, a single verb could belong to several classes that form a graph instead of a tree. For example, the class of creation and transformation (shown in Figure 2) is an alternating material class (Figure 2)."}, {"heading": "5 CEVO: Comprehensive EVent Ontology", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to move to another world in which they are able to find themselves."}, {"heading": "6 Use Cases", "text": "In the following, we present three use cases that show how CEVO is used to comment on textual and ontological relationships."}, {"heading": "6.1 Use Case 1: Annotating Relations in Text using CEVO", "text": "Figure 7 shows two headlines on Twitter. The first tweet was published by the BBC and the second by the New York Times. Tweet # 1 is quoted by the verb announce and Tweet # 2 by the verb say. Both tweets have a similar meaning in the sense that a message is transmitted. Noting these two tweets via CEVO results in us receiving the same tag communication for both of these verbs, while the two verbs do not announce and say lexical relationships like synonyms. Below, we comment on the two strings with nif5 vocabulary. < exam: tweet # 1 # char = 26.33 > a nif: string; nif: beginIndex 26; nif: endIndex 33; 5http: / / persistence.uni-leipzig.org / nlp2rdf / & nif / nif-core / nif-e.cornim.71"}, {"heading": "6.2 Use Case 2: Annotating Properties of Ontologies", "text": "CEVO can be used to comment on characteristics of any ontology. One way to provide such a comment is to use the Web Annotation Data Model6 (WADM), a framework for expressing annotations. A WADM note has two elements: (i) a target indicating the resource to be commented on, and (ii) the body indicating the description. Annotation properties of different ontologies according to CEVO address integration and alignment problems. Suppose we have the property dbp: spouse7 from the ontology of DBpedia that represents the relationship of marriages that semantically corresponds to the class cevo: amalgamates. The note of this property is presented in the Turtle syntax using the WADM frame as follows: Example: Annotation 1 a oa: Annotation; oa: hasget Tardbo: spouse; Body coa: evalgamo: Amalgamo."}, {"heading": "6.3 Use case 3: Linking Relations", "text": "CEVO facilitates linking relationships in plain text with ontological properties. We continue with the following example: On March 4, 2016, the BBC published this headline: tweet # 3: Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall marry. The embedded relationship in this part of the text is married. This relationship is commented on as cevo: Amalgamate employing CEVO ontology. We show this note with nif vocabulary below. < exam: tweet # 3 # char = 31.35 > a nif: String; nif: beginIndex 31; nif: endIndex 35; nif: anchorOf \"marry\"; 6 W3C Working Draft 15 October 2015, http: / / www.w3.org / TR / annotation-model 7We use the prefix dbo for DBpedia ontology.nif: oliaCategory Olia: MainVerb.a cevo: Amalgamate."}, {"heading": "7 Demo", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "8 Related Work", "text": "In this area, the definition of events present in various forms is very important."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions and Future Directions", "text": "This ontology is based on an abstract conceptualization of English verbs provided by Beth Levin in [7]. Such abstract conceptualization largely remedies deficiencies in (i) relationship extraction from text (ii) contextual equivalence of relationships and (iii) diversity of ontologies. This ontology presents more than 230 event classes for over 3000 English verbs as individuals. We plan to expand CEVO toward integration and networking with other existing ontologies, especially those that include event conceptualization. Currently, we are applying CEVO to the field of disaster response.
