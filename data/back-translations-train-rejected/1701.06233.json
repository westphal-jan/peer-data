It seems that certain jobs are more likely to attract or better fit certain people. While this hiring practice is often used by organizations, there has been no research directly looking at the links between different positions in the work environment and the people who hold those positions. Indeed, many studies on sociology and psychology suggest that many aspects of a person's life are deeply connected to their jobs (Lindquist, Beilin, and Knuiman 1997; Strully 2009). In this study, we looked at the links between different positions and the characteristics of people holding those positions, including the topics they use and whose personality traits they are interested in. Our findings suggested that jobs are more than just copyright c \u00a9 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.artiaia.org)."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The effects of work stress on long-term blood pressure are examined in the study (Lindquist, Beilin and Knuiman 1997). The paper shows that it is the way in which occupational stress is dealt with, and not the stress itself, that is significantly associated with working life. (Strully 2009) The correlation between employment status and health status is investigated. Authors report that employment status can influence certain health outcomes. Furthermore, the absence of illness, the use of alcohol and the fear of reorganization is demonstrably associated with working life (Voss, Floderus and Diderichsen 2004). Jobs also influence the lifestyle of workers. Payne et al. The different lifestyles of workers in high-stress jobs and low-stress jobs are us.

The API returns 150K user profiles. First, we select users who have both LinkedIn and Twitter accounts. Following their Twitter accounts, we download the 3,000 most recent tweets from these users via the Twitter search query API4. We remove users who do not have enough English tweets (less than 2,000) to guarantee the validity of our results. We then collect job information via LinkedIn links. We also remove people who do not have a skill list on the LinkedIn page because we cannot categorize their jobs for them. Ultimately, we get a total of 9,800 users."}, {"heading": "Tweets Cleaning and Phrase Selection", "text": "Twokenizer5 is an NLP tool specifically designed for tweets. It detects abbreviations or slang (b4 for before, fb for Facebook), misspellings or spellings (fir for preposition for) and emoticons (:), < 3) in tweets. In practice, however, Twokenizer usually removes all official emojis, because these emojis are associated with other words in many cases. Therefore, we use Twokenizer to separate words from tweets, and we also use a fixed emoji list to recognize all official emojis. Terms that are too popular (used by more than 95% of users) and too unpopular (used by less than 10% of users) are removed. We apply the same thresholds to phrases (2-gram and 3-gram)."}, {"heading": "Job Categorization", "text": "Most LinkedIn users report on their industries in their profiles, such as \"Marketing,\" \"Public Relations\" and \"Web Design.\" However, these industry tags are not precise enough; and some of them are even ambiguous. We have observed many cases where people with different industry tags actually work in the same position. For example, a computer science professor might describe his / her industries as \"computer science,\" \"\" higher education \"or\" research. \"To learn a person's real job, we use a person's skills. A person's skills are supported by people who connect with that person, and are listed in one of the linkedIn pages. In addition to a list of supported skills, the number of supported skills is also provided. We vectorize a person's skills into a fixed order vector. Each dimension represents a skill and the values of the elements in a vector are the corresponding skills that that that person receives."}, {"heading": "Results of Open Vocabulary Approach", "text": "Most of them are able to outdo themselves by embarking on a search for new ways to survive.

Previous work shows that people's personality can be calculated from their tweets (Qiu et al. 2012). We use the IBM Watson Personality Insights Service API10 to calculate the personality traits from people's tweets. Input is all a person's tweets, and the service analyzes linguistic traits to infer personality, including Big Five, Needs, and Values. Due to the length limitation, we will only discuss the Big Five Personality Traits in this paper. Big Five is a widely studied theory of the five broad dimensions that describe the human personality (Goldberg 1993). The five dimensions are: openness to how open a person is to unusual ideas, curiosity, and diversity of experiences. In other words, a higher acceptance for new things and change."}, {"heading": "Occupation Prediction", "text": "Motivated by observations about the correlation between human characteristics and occupations, although we are building a classifier to predict jobs based on characteristics extracted from tweets, each person receives a normalized weight for each job. We designate the person with the job of highest weight if the weight is greater than 0.8. If none of the weights is greater than 0.8, we remove the person from our data set. In each prediction task, we collect people from a job as positive data and then try out an equal number of people from jobs other than negative data. We have 4 sets of features: LIWC features, 2,000 tweets topics, words and phrases, and all beyond. The values of words and phrases features are the TF-IDF values calculated based on their frequency in tweets, as negative data. The values of Tweet theme features are the weights assigned to each person, topics, words and phrases, and all, and all beyond."}, {"heading": "Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we examine the differences between professions. On multiple platforms, we gathered user information from various aspects. To overcome the ambiguity and uncertainty of the self-reported information, soft clustering was used to extract professions from crowdsourced data. Linguistic styles were described with the most positive and negative correlated words and phrases, while people's interests are learned from their tweets by extracting significant topics. Big Five traits are also derived from the tweet texts. We used personality correlation coefficients to reveal the differences in human traits across individual jobs. Results suggest that people with different jobs have unique preferences for specific language styles and interests. Our results also show clearly different levels of the Big Five traits of different jobs. A classifier was created to predict people's work based on traits extracted from tweets, the characteristics of which we can determine from tweets."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "We would like to thank the Goergen Institute for Data Science and the Xerox Foundation for their support of the State of New York."}], "references": [{"title": "A", "author": ["R.
