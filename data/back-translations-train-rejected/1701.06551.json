Introduction", "text": "It is necessary to remove aromatic compounds from heavy oil sections in order to improve the quality of the lubricating oil base oils produced [1-2]. The extraction of aromatic compounds from lubricating oil sections usually takes place through a liquid-liquid (solvent) extraction process. Several works have been carried out to find a suitable solvent for the extraction of aromatic hydrocarbons from lubricating oil sections [3-5]. Sulfolane is strongly used as a solvent for this process due to its high selectivity in the extraction of aromatics. This compound is suitable for the extraction of light and heavy vacuum distillates [6-9]. In a liquid-liquid extraction process (solvent), two flows of feed and solvents within the column must be kept in contact with each other. Studies on the efficiency of conventional extraction contactors show that RDC (rotating disc contactors) extraction containers can be considered the most efficient of the extraction parameters of DC-13."}, {"heading": "2. Materials and Methods", "text": "2.1 Chemical Extraction Process One of the ways to produce lubricating oils is through solvent extraction processes where the starting material, usually a lubricating oil cut, comes into contact with an extraction solvent, in this case sulfolans [23]. In this paper, industrial field data was used to train an ANN model capable of predicting the performance of column 2.2 Neural Network Architecture A Feed-Forward Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network. (These parameters were carefully selected to represent the real system.) The input parameters were independent of one and the other and were those that most affected the flow rate of the main product, including the temperature of the starting and solvent, the rotation rate of discs and solvents to the starting parameters, and the only output parameter was selected to represent the flow rate of the main product flow."}, {"heading": "3. Results and Discussion", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 ANN modeling/Pattern Generation", "text": "The optimal number of neuron nodes in the hidden layer was selected based on the minimum values of the (MSE) and (Error%) of different ANN models created using different numbers of nodes. Table 2 lists these parameters according to 100,000 iterations of the model. Looking at the results, we found that a network of 7 hidden nodes has the lowest values of MSE and Error%, which is best in line with our objectives. The average relative error and maximum relative error for the network outputs after training the 4-7-1 network are listed in Table 3: To further validate the accuracy of the ANN model, 80 data points that were not involved in the modeling process were used for comparison purposes."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusion", "text": "It was possible to safely perform a parametric study of the performance of an RDC column in terms of its operating conditions using an artificial neural network method. Results showed that increasing the ratio of solvents to feed increases the amount of faromates extracted from the feed stream. Increasing the rotation rate will improve the extraction process."}], "references": [{"title": "An approach to fault diagnosis of chemical processes via neural networks", "author": ["J.Y. Fan", "M.
