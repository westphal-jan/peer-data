Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam, phishing, drive-by exploits, etc.) and lure unsuspecting users to become victims of scams (monetary loss, theft of private information, and malware installation), and cause losses of billions of dollars every year. It is imperative to detect and act on such threats in a timely manner. Traditionally, this detection is done mostly through the usage of blacklists. However, blacklists cannot be exhaustive, and lack the ability to detect newly generated malicious URLs. To improve the generality of malicious URL detectors, machine learning techniques have been explored with increasing attention in recent years. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of Malicious URL Detection techniques using machine learning. We present the formal formulation of Malicious URL Detection as a machine learning task, and categorize and review the contributions of literature studies that addresses different dimensions of this problem (feature representation, algorithm design, etc.). Further, this article provides a timely and comprehensive survey for a range of different audiences, not only for machine learning researchers and engineers in academia, but also for professionals and practitioners in cybersecurity industry, to help them understand the state of the art and facilitate their own research and practical applications. We also discuss practical issues in system design, open research challenges, and point out some important directions for future research.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 06:46:14 GMT  (409kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07179v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 16 Mar 2017 07:12:50 GMT  (411kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07179v2", "21 pages, 3 figures"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR", "authors": ["doyen sahoo", "chenghao liu", "steven c h hoi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07179"}, "pdf": {"name": "1701.07179.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Malicious URL Detection using Machine Learning: A Survey", "authors": ["Doyen Sahoo", "Chenghao Liu", "Steven C.H.

FEATURE REPRESENTATION", "text": "As already mentioned, the success of a machine learning model depends crucially on the quality of the training data, which depends on the quality of the feature representation. Given a URL u-U, in which U denotes a domain of all valid URL strings, the goal of the feature representation is to find an assignment g: U \u2192 Rd, so that g (u) \u2192 x is where x-dimensional feature vector that can be fed into machine learning models. Further, the feature representation process can be divided into two steps: 1) Feature Collection: This phase is technology-oriented, the goal being to collect most, if not all, relevant information about the URLs, including information such as the presence of URLs in a black list, the direct features of the URL such as the URL string and information about the host, the content of the website such as HTML and JavaScript, popularity information, etc., in order to obtain various types of information that can be collected from a feature descriptions, such as the URL."}, {"heading": "A. BlackList Features", "text": "As already mentioned, a trivial technique for identifying malicious URLs is the use of blacklists. An existing URL that has been identified as malicious (either through extensive analysis or crowd sourcing) finds its way into the list. However, it has been pointed out that, despite its simplicity and ease of implementation, blacklisting suffers from non-trivial high false negatives [7] because it is difficult to maintain comprehensive up-to-date lists. So instead of using the blacklist presence alone as a decision maker, it can be used as a powerful feature. In particular [12], blacklist presence was used as a feature of 6 different blacklist service providers. They also analyzed the effectiveness of these features compared to other features and observed that blacklist features alone were not as good as other features, but when used in conjunction with other features, the overall performance of the prediction model improved. [31] To circumvent blacklisting detection, many attackers made minor changes to the original URL."}, {"heading": "B.

[11] They investigated the impact of a few host-based features on the malignancy of URLs. Some of the most important observations were that the detection of malicious URLs from time to time from the registration of the domain almost immediately leads to the malicious URLs; and many used botnets to host on multiple machines. As a result, host-based features became an important element in the detection of malicious URLs."}, {"heading": "D.

Other Features", "text": "In recent years, the growth of short URL service providers that provide the original URL, which is represented by a shorter string, has been observed, enabling the sharing of URLs on social media platforms such as Twitter, where the original long URLs would not fit within the 140-character limit of a tweet. Unfortunately, this has also become a popular obfuscation technique for the malicious URLs. While short URL service providers are trying their best not to generate short URLs for the malicious ones, they are struggling to do an effective job, relying primarily on blacklists [67], [68]. As a result, a recent research direction has become active, where context characteristics of the URL are activated, i.e., the characteristics of the background information where the URL was shared are derived from the tweets in which the URL was shared maliciously. [70] Contextual information used to classify the URLs used as traffic information was not used to classify the URLs, or the traffic information was shared as a short click."}, {"heading": "F. Summary of Feature Representations", "text": "There is a wide range of information that can be obtained for a URL. Crawling the information and transforming the 9 unstructed information to a machine learning compatible feature vector can be very resource intensive. While additional information can improve predictive models (subject to appropriate regulation), it is often impractical to have a variety of functions in a database that are unfeasible to be compared with billions of URLs. Another example is the Kolmogorov complexity - which requires comparison to several malicious and user-friendly URLs. This is unfeasible for comparison with billions of URLs."}, {"heading": "IV. MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR MALICIOUS URL DETECTION", "text": "After converting URLs into feature vectors, many of these learning algorithms can be widely applied to train a predictive model in a relatively straightforward way. However, in order to effectively solve the problem, some efforts have been made to develop specific learning algorithms that either exploit the properties that the training data of malicious URLs have, or address some specific challenges facing the application. In this section, we categorize and review the learning algorithms used for this task, and also propose appropriate machine learning technologies that can be used to solve specific challenges. We categorize the learning algorithms into: Batch Learning Algorithms, Online Algorithms, Representation Learning and others. Batch Learning algorithms work on the assumption that all the training data is available before the training task. Online learning algorithms treat the data like a stream of instances, and learn an extremely precise pattern, malware detection, malware detection methods, and much more."}, {"heading": "A. Batch Learning", "text": "Following the previous problem, let's look at a URLs dataset with T URLs (u1, y1),. (uT, yT), where ut-U for t-1,.., T represents a URL from the training data, and yt-1) is its class name, where y = 1 points to a malicious URL and y = \u2212 1 to a benign URL. (g: U 7 \u2192 Rd) as discussed in the previous section, you can map a URL instance into a d-dimensional vector, i.e., g (ui) xi. As a result, you can apply any existing learning algorithm that can work with vector space data to train a predictive model for malicious URLs detection tasks. In this section, we review the most popular batch learning algorithms used for malicious URLs."}, {"heading": "B.

Representation Learning", "text": "There is a large number and variety of traits used to detect malicious URLs. Specifically, the use of bag and word traits for many of the trait categories results in millions of traits. In addition, as the number of URLs to be processed has increased (which is the case in the real world), the number of traits used by so many traits also grows, among two main disadvantages: \u2022 Computing power and testing time are significantly high, not only because of the many mathematical operations that need to be performed, but also because of the collection and pre-processing of so many traits. In many cases (e.g. using bigram and tri-gram traits) we get so many traits that it is practically impossible to perform any optimization. \u2022 Noise Models: Malicious URL Detection often displays a greater number of traits than the number of instances available for training."}, {"heading": "D. Other Learning Methods", "text": "Most of the algorithms used for Malicious URL Detection take the form of binary classification, but other problem settings have not become very popular. Some of these settings are designed for problems specifically encountered in Malicious URL Detection.1) Unattended learning is the scenario where the true label of the data is not available during the training phase, and these approaches are based on anomalous detection techniques, in which the anomaly is defined as abnormal behavior. There are several algorithms in the literature that can be used for anomalous detection (e.g. 1-class SVMs, etc.) Unfortunately, due to the wildly different composition of URLs, it is difficult to determine what is \"normal\" and what is a result."}, {"heading": "E. Summary of Machine Learning Algorithms", "text": "There is a wide variety of machine learning algorithms in the literature that can be used directly in connection with the detection of malicious URLs. Due to the potentially enormous size of the training data (millions of instances and features), there was a need for scalable algorithms, which is why online learning methods have found great success in this area. Efforts have also been made to exploit the scarcity of data to improve algorithmic performance. Finally, there have been efforts to change the problem from a typical binary classification algorithm to solve class imbalances and multicase problems. Using these technologies to create living systems is another challenging task. Below, we discuss real systems to show how to use malicious URLs detection as a service.

Differences in malicious URLs distribution between Twitter and spam emails were observed, and correspondingly different models were developed for both. Monarch, at the time of development, could process 15 million URLs per day for less than $800 per day.

threat to cybersecurity. Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam, phishing, drive-by exploits, etc.) and lure unsuspecting users to become victims of scams (monetary loss, theft of private information, and malware installation), and cause losses of billions of dollars every year. It is imperative to detect and act on such threats in a timely manner. Traditionally, this detection is done mostly through the usage of blacklists. However, blacklists cannot be exhaustive, and lack the ability to detect newly generated malicious URLs. To improve the generality of malicious URL detectors, machine learning techniques have been explored with increasing attention in recent years. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of Malicious URL Detection techniques using machine learning. We present the formal formulation of Malicious URL Detection as a machine learning task, and categorize and review the contributions of literature studies that addresses different dimensions of this problem (feature representation, algorithm design, etc.). Further, this article provides a timely and comprehensive survey for a range of different audiences, not only for machine learning researchers and engineers in academia, but also for professionals and practitioners in cybersecurity industry, to help them understand the state of the art and facilitate their own research and practical applications. We also discuss practical issues in system design, open research challenges, and point out some important directions for future research.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
