This often leads to unreliable or inconsistent statements about the data, rendering practical applications, especially in scientific domains, futile. Therefore, we here extend the optimistic estimator framework for optimal subgroup discovery to a new class of objective functions: we show how tight estimators can be computed efficiently for all functions that are determined by subgroup size (non-decreasing dependence), the subgroup median value, and a dispersion measure around the median (non-increasing dependence). In the important special case when dispersion is measured using the average absolute deviation from the median, this novel approach yields a linear time algorithm. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets shows that, when used within branch-and-bound search, this approach is highly efficient and indeed discovers subgroups with much smaller errors.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 13:36:43 GMT  (1542kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07696v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 23 Apr 2017 09:34:35 GMT  (1579kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07696v2", "significance of empirical results tested; additional illustrations; table of used notations"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["mario boley", "bryan r goldsmith", "luca m ghiringhelli", "jilles vreeken"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07696"}, "pdf": {"name": "1701.07696.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Identifying Consistent Statements about Numerical Data with Dispersion-Corrected Subgroup Discovery", "authors": ["Mario Boley", "Bryan R.

To this end, we define the general notion of a measure of the central tendency as the following. It can be verified that this definition applies to the standard measures of the central tendency, i.e., the arithmetic and geometric averages, as well as the median2 med.

Specifically, we will focus on the median as a measure of the central tendency and consider functions that decrease both monotonously in the described subpopulation size and monotonously in any dispersion size. To describe exactly this function class, we must formalize the term dispersion size around the median. For our purpose, the following definition suffices.

Figure 4 shows the characteristics of the optimal subgroups discovered in relation to both of these objective functions (see also Tab. 1 for exact values), where the language of closed conjunctions Ccnj was used as the description language for all datasets. The first observation is that - as forced by design - the mean absolute deviation from the median variant is lower for all datasets (except in a case where both functions result in the same subgroup)."}, {"heading": "4.2.

Conclusion", "text": "During the preceding sections, we developed and evaluated an effective algorithm for simultaneously optimizing size, central tendency, and dispersion in subgroup discovery with a numerical target. However, this algorithm is based on two central results: 1) the strict optimistic estimator for each objective function based on any dispersion measurement around the median cannot be calculated as the maximum of the function on a linear sequence of sentences - the median sequence (Prop. 2); and 2) for objective functions based on the concept of dispersion-corrected reporting. Absolute deviation from the median, individual sequence of the median sequence can be generated in incremental constant time (Thm. 3).Among the possible applications of the proposed approach, it is perhaps most important to replace the standard coverage in classical objective functions with dispersion-corrected reporting, d.."}, {"heading": "A.

This often leads to unreliable or inconsistent statements about the data, rendering practical applications, especially in scientific domains, futile. Therefore, we here extend the optimistic estimator framework for optimal subgroup discovery to a new class of objective functions: we show how tight estimators can be computed efficiently for all functions that are determined by subgroup size (non-decreasing dependence), the subgroup median value, and a dispersion measure around the median (nonincreasing dependence). In the important special case when dispersion is measured using the mean absolute deviation from the median, this novel approach yields a linear time algorithm. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets shows that, when used within branch-and-bound search, this approach is highly efficient and indeed discovers subgroups with much smaller errors.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
