INTRODUCTION", "text": "Trending topic analysis is actually to spot a pattern or trend on collected date. Trending topic may be different from time to time and from place to place. It is the people who decide which topic will govern for a particular time or is most discussed. Current trends for a particular area can be detected with satisfactory precision if we collect data that represent the current situation in this area. With the expansion of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, this type of data is becoming more and more available. But newspapers are another option that can help us in this case. Newspaper online content is growing rapidly with time and the growing audience. Daily newspapers update news daily and people find their news online. Statistical analysis of this newspaper data can reveal the situation of a particular country.In Bangladesh, newspapers have always been a popular and important source of information in Bangladesh. Because in the past a large number of people in our country did not have Internet access. Although currently almost all newspapers Bangladeshis have an online version. In this thesis we propose a generalized theme to find this model."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORKS ON TRENDING TOPIC", "text": "Trending Topics analytics specifically find a way to extract the most commonly used and meaningful keywords that are popular among people from the data stream. News trend analysis for newspapers written in major languages such as English, Spanish, French is not a new concept, but the research was essentially conducted using data from social media such as Twitter, Google, Wikipedia, etc. There is a comprehensive study of these three major online and social media streams [3]. L. M. Aiello et al. compared six methods for detecting topics to detect Twitter trends from Twitter records that relate to major events [4]. In 2012, Rong Lu and Qing Yang worked on Twitter trend analysis, including analysis of reasons for news topics [5]. In social media trends topics, the topic is not constant and it rises and falls apart after a certain time [6]. For a certain time, we can easily take a look at the most popular topic right now, which is Twitter."}, {"heading": "3. METHODOLOGY", "text": "We collected data from two popular Bangladeshi newspapers, \"Prothom-Alo\" and \"Kaler Kantho.\" We separated each word and excluded stopwords from it. Then, using the Chisquared test [12], we performed a unigram of this data. In this process, we placed keywords with a higher chi square test value first, and with the same chi square test value, we looked at their frequency. We marked them as trend topic candidates for a week. Later, we used the same strategy for both bigrams and trigrams, but this time for two and three consecutive words. Top keywords became more relevant to the trend topic. Then, we selected some keywords that were most likely to become a trend topic, and drew some comparison curves from these keywords. We manually grouped keywords of similar significance in our news data to visualize a comparison."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENT AND PERFORMANCE", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing", "text": "The data collection was carried out using a tailor-made web crawler from the online version of the two most popular Bangla Newspapers, Prothom Alo and Kaler Kantho. He systematically searched the websites of these two newspapers and saved relevant data for this work. The raw data collected by Prothom Alo is not structured and is not suitable for performing statistical analyses. In order to determine structural data, the authors created a custom corpus containing messages from Prothom Alo and Kaler Kantho separately by date.For each corresponding date, there is a word list. In each language, there are some common words that are used more frequently and are not very meaningful compared to keywords. And they cannot be trend topic candidates. These stop words were filtered from the corpus. A list of Bangla stop words [13] was prepared and combined."}, {"heading": "4.2 Unigram", "text": "Unigram works with a single word. Initially, the frequency of each word was counted. This simple unigram or frequency count provides an interesting result, but most words with high frequency are irrelevant and do not make sense as a trend topic. For each keyword, the value of the chi square test was found. The formula is: expectedexpctedobserved 2 (1) Here in equivalence (1), a word shift is expected of an observed word frequency. However, for different unigrams there is the same chi square value. In this case, a tie was broken by taking frequency trends into account and drawing unigram trends.Fig.1 Prothom Alo trending topics for each week from 1 January 2010 to 30 April 2010 using UnigramFrom Fig. 1, Weekly trending topics of Prothom Alo newspaper for 4 months can be shown."}, {"heading": "4.3 Bigram", "text": "After applying unique specimens to our message data, it can be determined that more than one unique specimen had the same value in the chi-square test, and some trending topics are simply not useful, and bigrams were used to ignore them. Counting the frequency of two adjacent keywords or bigrams, the chi-square test now gives a unique value for each bigram and result. Table 1 shows the chi-square test value of the top 5 bigrams of a week with frequency. From this table, it can be determined that the chi-square test value is completely different and clearly distinguishable for each bigram. By using this method, the top topic of a week can be found. Also, chart (fig. 2) can be plotted for some of the top bigrams of a week with frequency, showing how a topic rises or falls with the time change."}, {"heading": "4.4 Trigram", "text": "The frequency measurement of bigrams showed a better performance in the search for a trend topic of the Bangla Newspaper. Now, the frequency of three adjacent keywords or trigrams was counted. Similar technique used in the search for a trend topic for bigrams was applied in this case. From Table 2, which shows the top 5 trigrams of a week with their chi-square test value and their frequency. 5 | Autor et. I C E R I 2 0 1 7But for some weekly trigrams yields a better result than bigram.The peak value of the frequency of the same trigrams can also be found in different locations (Fig. 3). For this reason, non-clustered data trigrams are better suited than unigrams or even bigramm.Fig.3 Trending topics by Prothom Alo for each week from January 1, 2010 to April 30, 2010 for trigrams."}, {"heading": "4.5 Analysis and Comparison for Specific Keyword", "text": "Newspaper trends can be grouped into different categories such as entertainment, business, sports, education, etc. Trending topics for each of these categories can vary. A universal trend can also be selected for a certain time. Now, the presentation of a graph by manually providing bundled keywords can provide some interesting facts. These keywords can be associated with gender, politics or the cultural world. This analysis will reveal the inner philosophy of Bangla Newspaper.Do they provide politically biased opinions? Does it represent ordinary people? The answer to these questions will be answered using this specific keyword analysis in Bangla.Fig.4 Percentage of news about men and women in different categories in Prothom Alo NewspaperThe graph in Fig. 4 compares men and women in different categories. This graph shows that in the crime and accident category men are most frequently discussed in the newspaper Prothom Alo. And in other categories women are discussed more frequently than men."}, {"heading": "4.6 Performance", "text": "Bangla word processing is not an easy task and there are not enough resources to process data and perform statistical analyses on this data.7 | Autor et. al., I C E R I 2 0 1 7Fig.5: Percentage of relevant unigrams, bigrams and trigrams Trending Topics in Bangla newsapersStatistical analyses were carried out on the basis of 18-week news data. Subsequently, the top 5 trends for each week were selected. After analysing the results, it was determined that this generalised model for unigrams does not have as many relevant trending topics. Fig. 5 shows the performance of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams Trending Topics for Bangla Newspaper. From this analysis it can be said that for Trending Topics Analysis on Bangla newspaper trigrams show the best performance."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, a generalized model has been designed that can be used to perform Trending Topic Analysis for Bangla Newspaper. Trending Topics of Bangla Newspaper follow a specific pattern. Some analysis of this pattern can be helpful in predicting future Trending Topics or future situation in this country. Therefore, Trending Topic Analysis on Bangla Newspaper data is crucial. Improving this model can make performance much better, such as clustering keywords with similar contextual meaning and then performing statistical analysis on each cluster. Further improvements to this generalized model will improve performance and allow for a much more accurate selection of Trending Topics in Bangla Newspaper."}], "references": [{"title": "Analysis and forecasting of trending topics in online media streams", "author": ["Tim Althoff", "Damian Borth", "Jrn Hees", "Andreas Dengel"], "venue": "MM \u201913 Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Multimedia Pages", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Sensing Trending Topics in Twitter", "author": ["L.M.
