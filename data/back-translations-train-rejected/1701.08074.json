This is attributed to the dimensionality of the state space and the large amount of control variables. To this end, a cluster of flexibility carriers is considered with the goal of providing day modulation services to a transmission system operator.

Model-Based DHN Control", "text": "When implementing a model-based control approach for a DHN, whether centralized or distributed, one is confronted with (1) the nonlinearity in the dynamics of a DHN and (2) the slow time scales compared to, for example, an electrical network [29]. Taking these effects into account is crucial for good performance of the controller. Several model-based optimization approaches have been identified in the literature that explicitly include the dynamics of DHN. For example, in [11] a simplified model was derived that is used in conjunction with sequential quadratic programming. In [30] approximate dynamic programming [31], using permutational symmetries of DHN dynamics, a model-based approach using a blurred direct matrix control to mitigate nonlinearity of DHN dynamics was found. Although model-based solutions may have excellent performance, the DHN and the consumer may require precise coupling."}, {"heading": "3. Problem description", "text": "Inspired by Gemine et al.

In a first step, a hydraulic simulation is carried out, in a second step, the thermal dynamics are calculated. For the hydraulic calculations, the approach proposed in [38] is followed, which results in the application of Kirchhoff's laws taking into account that there is a nonlinear relationship between pressure and flow rate. To calculate the thermal dynamics, the node model presented by Benonysson [39] was used, which essentially solves the following equation for each raw section: cpw 20s mTw \u2202 t + cpw \u2202 t + cpw \u0445 m \u0445 Tw \u2202 x + hA (Tw \u2212 Tg) = Q.

The control approach presented in Figure 2 and followed in this paper is based on a three-step approach outlined in [14, 43], following a strategy similar to that in [21, 24]. In a first step, (1) all relevant (and practically available) state information is collected, e.g. temperature information from the ERC. From this information, a limited set of characteristics [17] is extracted, leading to a low-dimensional representation of the system state. In a second step (2), a control measure for the entire ERC cluster is extracted from a policy determined offline in predetermined time intervals. In a third and final step (3), this control measure is executed across the different ERC using a market-based multi-agent system. This process is repeated according to a regressive horizon approach, the following three steps are presented in more detail."}, {"heading": "4.1.

The control action ut is selected for the entire cluster projected onto individual control measures, as described in Section 4.3. One of the main objectives of this work is to explore to what extent (model-free) reinforcement learning can be used to determine \u03c0. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a model-free control approach that learns a policy through interaction with the system [40]. Recent literature has presented RL (mainly in the form of Q-Learning [48, 49, 50]) as an effective model-free learning approach for DR applications. However, practice suffers from slow convergence [15, 40] and the curse of dimensionality [17]. These challenges can be partially mitigated by using past interactions and corresponding function approximators in a BRL strategy."}, {"heading": "4.3. Step 3: Real-time control", "text": "In a third step, the energy corresponding to the individual devices is sent via a market-based multi-agent system [14, 55] via the TCL cluster. Compared to the work of [5], there is a significant difference, since only the expected flow rate for each TCL is assumed to be available. To this end, a proportional integrator (PI) is used, which manages the flow rates at the various buildings. As hydraulic effects occur almost immediately in a DHN, this will have a direct impact on the flow rate at the source and affect performance on the source side, since the supply target value is assumed to be constant in the simulations [29]. An overview of the real-time control can be seen in Figure 3. As described in Section 4.1, each TCL is represented by a quotation function bd. After a clearing process (26), a clearing priority pr * is sent back to the various devices: p > r = min p.r > p.bp This function is represented by a nearby TL."}, {"heading": "5. Evaluation", "text": "In order to evaluate the performance of the controller described in Section 4, a series of simulations were performed.

Simulation scenario", "text": "As mentioned in section 1, the scenario is designed in such a way that it is sufficiently demanding, but also simple enough, to allow an analysis that is not clouded by the complexity of the scenario. To this end, the (arbitrary) topology as shown in Figure 1 has been used, i.e. a central CHP (\u03b7 = 0.97, \u03c6 = 0.93, PTp, max = 1100 kW) delivers heat to 100 TCLs connected to a radial DHN. Each building is located in one of four streets. The total length of the network is 2.1 km, with pipe diameters ranging from DN25 to DN100. A detailed description of the simulation scenario can be found in [29]. The TCL building models are capacity models packed into a pot, with an electrical analogue consisting of capacities and resistances. The capacity values are related to the temperature of the indoor air, a building envelope and the heating residual temperature -29 \u00b0 C. All the values for a building, which correspond to a temperature for a model, 414 and a capacity for a house, contain one of the values for the temperature of the solar resistant air."}, {"heading": "5.2. Tracking performance", "text": "A first supporting result is shown in Figure 4, where a numerical experiment was carried out in which a random control measure (within the technical specification of the CHP) was selected every 15 minutes. In the lower part of Figure 4, the corresponding target values are shown, as well as the average thermal output of the CHP. In the upper diagram of Figure 4, the internal temperatures of the 100 buildings and the average temperature are shown. It is shown that when the buildings are on average in their dead band, the desired power can be closely traced. Although the buildings have different physical parameters, they tend to synchronize with respect to their temperature in relation to the comfort limitations. This is a direct effect of transmission dynamics, since buildings with higher priority are served first."}, {"heading": "5.3. Energy arbitrage", "text": "In the scenario of energy arbitrage, CHP can sell its electricity directly on the wholesale market [2]. Energy prices are taken from the Belgian day-ahead market [3], and the gas price is set at 38.6e / MWh [4]. However, the simulation period lasts up to 80 days. Figure 5 shows the results of this numerical experiment. Figure 6 shows this for practical reasons, as the calculation of a policy usually takes 20 minutes."}, {"heading": "5.4. peak shaving", "text": "The second graph shows the average daily ambient temperature. In fact, the maximum daily power peak decreases over time. To make performance more visible, the load duration curves for the first and last 50 days are also plotted, both for the BRL approach and for the standard controller. In the first 50 days, there is a limited improvement over the standard controller, but for the following period, the effect of the controller can be clearly observed using the load duration curves. A lower limit is represented by plotting the average power corresponding to the daily energy consumed by the standard controller approach. Note: On the seventh day (top graph in Figure 7), the profile obtained with BRL results in a high peak power attributed to an exploration step (24). The final power is more clearly shown in Figure 8, where the logical power profile is plotted for the standard temperature controller."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions and future work", "text": "In this work, the control problem of a cluster of thermostatically controlled loads connected to a district heating network is addressed by the evaluation of the performance of a control approach involving a model-free learning method for amplification in combination with a market-based multi-agent system. The performance of the controller has been evaluated for two different scenarios, i.e. energy arbitrage and peak shaving. In the evaluation, a detailed district heating network model has been used, including hydraulic and thermal dynamics. For the energy arbitrage scenario, solutions are obtained which achieve over 65% of the available optimisation potential after a learning period of 40 to 60 days. Knowing that politics are updated on a daily basis, this is regarded as a promising result.

"Optimal control of thermostatically controlled loads connected to a district heating network is considered a sequential decisionmaking problem under uncertainty. The practicality of a direct model-based approach is compromised by two challenges, namely scalability due to the large dimensionality of the problem and the system identification required to identify an accurate model. To help in mitigating these problems, this paper leverages on recent developments in reinforcement learning in combination with a market-based multi-agent system to obtain a scalable solution that obtains a significant performance improvement in a practical learning time. The control approach is applied on a scenario comprising 100 thermostatically controlled loads connected to a radial district heating network supplied by a central combined heat and power plant. Both for an energy arbitrage and a peak shaving objective, the control approach requires 60 days to obtain a performance within 65% of a theoretical lower bound on the cost.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
