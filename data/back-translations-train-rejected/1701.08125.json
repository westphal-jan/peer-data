Consequently, we define the term \"organic computing\" (OC) as follows: an \"organic computing system\" (or just an organic system) is a technical system equipped with sensors (to perceive its environment) and actuators (to manipulate it); it adapts autonomously and dynamically to the current conditions of the perceived environment. This adaptation process has an impact on the usability of the organic system, which is continuously improved by the organic system itself. To enable such adaptive behavior, it employs so-called self-mechanisms that affect it."}, {"heading": "3 Self-* Properties of Organic Systems", "text": "In this case, it is a matter of a pure \"yes,\" a \"yes,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"yes,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" \"a\" no, \"\" a \"no,\" a \"yes,\" a \"no,\" a \"a\" yes, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"no,\" a \"no,\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, a \"a\" a \"no,\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"no,\" a \"a\" no, \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"a\" a \"no,\" a \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"no,\" a \"a\" a \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" no, \"a\" a \"no,\" a \",\" a \"\" a \",\" a \"a\" no, \"a\" a \"\", \"a\" a \",\" a \", a\" \"\" a \"\" \"a\" \"a\" \", a\" \"a\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\", a \"\", a \"\" \"\" \",\""}, {"heading": "4 A Brief History of Organic Computing", "text": "This year, the time has come for a realignment, in which there will be a realignment."}, {"heading": "5 Outlook: Organic Computing Development Options", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able to survive are able to survive themselves, to survive themselves, and that they are not able to survive themselves."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we briefly summarized the historical development in the context of the Organic Computing Initiative. Organic Computing is a systems engineering initiative that proposed to use concepts such as self-adaptation and self-organization to enhance the robustness of technical systems. As - at least from our point of view - there is no precise and universally accepted concept of the term in the literature, we derived a specification of the concept and the underlying objectives of the initiative from the transfer of more autonomy to the systems themselves and supplemented it with an explanation of the main characteristics of OC systems. Finally, future development options of OC were outlined."}], "references": [{"title": "Interwoven Systems", "author": ["S. Tomforde", "J. H\u00e4hner", "B.
