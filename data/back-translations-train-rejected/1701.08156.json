INTRODUCTION", "text": "A phoneme is one of the sound units (or motion units based on gesture-based communication) that distinguish a single word from another in a particular dialect. At the point where two sounds can be used to separate words from each other, it can be said that they have a place with different phonemes. Barman (2011) says that a phoneme is represented by certain components that make it a different element in an array of sounds available in a language. Although Bengali is one of the most widely spoken languages on the planet, not very many literature references have been found in the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for the Bengali language. More than 265 million people speak Bengali as their local dialect. A major difficulty in researching Bangla ASR is the lack of correct speech corpus, although some efforts are being made to develop Bangla's speech corpus to build a Bangla text into the language system, in \"Experiments with the Selection of P. Language Units for P.,\" the automatic language corpus specified for WA."}, {"heading": "1.1 Bangla phoneme", "text": "In the phonetic inventory of the Bengali language, there are 14 vowels and 29 consonants. The vowel sentence comprises seven nasalized vowels. In the IPA, an approximate phonetic scheme is given in Ghulam at el. (2009) in its \"Automatic speech recognition for Bangla numbers\" and in C. Masica (1991) in his book \"Indo-Aryan languages.\" Here, only the most important 7 vowel sounds are shown, although there are two other long equivalents of / i / and / u /, which are referred to as / i: / and / u: / respectively."}, {"heading": "1.2 Scope of Automatic Speech Recognition or Phoneme Recognition:", "text": "Most ASR systems today have a phonetic level of representation. There are a variety of reasons, probably the most relevant being that it represents a useful level of abstraction that enables training data to be used effectively (that is, there are probably too many states below that level and it is difficult to get representative examples, such as words, above that level), and when decoding search results, it represents a useful source of constraint. On a more practical level, the meaning of ASR is the transcription of language (i.e. words), so the emphasis is on how to combine the different levels to achieve accurate word results. Phonetic transcription per se is not a particular focus. Phonetic transcription plays a role in systems that try to deal with words from the vocabulary (OOV) that by definition do not occur in the vocabulary. Phonetic (and word fragments) decoding \"provides a new mechanism for ASR to allow words to flow through the system, and then ASR can incorporate them into the system."}, {"heading": "2. PHONEME RECOGNITION METHODS", "text": "The development of various types of hidden, synthetically-based automatic speech recognition systems of the Markov model (HMM) can be found in recent work by Hossain, el. (2007) on their \"Bangla vowel characterization,\" Hasnat et al. (2007) on their isolated and continuous Bangla speech recognition: implementation, performance and application perspective. \"paper, Hoque and A. K. M (2006) on their\" Bengal segmented automatic speech recognition, \"Kirchhoff al. (2002) on their\" combination of acoustic and articulating features for robust speech recognition. \"And others in which Bengal automatic speech recognition is present to some extent. A pre-processed form is used most of the time by these ASR systems, such as Mel frequency receiver coefficients (MFCCs) of the speech signal that encode the time-frequency distribution of the signal energy, but do not provide better acoustic performance in these MCs."}, {"heading": "2.1 Multilayer neural network:", "text": "Bengali phoneme recognition using artificial neural networks (ANN) is described in Roy et al. (2002), entitled \"Developing the speech recognition system using artificial neural networks.\" However, most of this work uses a very small database and focuses on simple recognition or on the frequency distributions of different vowels and consonants. Another work related to multi-layered neural networks is carried out by Kotwal and Alam (2010), whose technique uses multi-layered neural networks (MLN) as a single-layered neural network that cannot resolve the effects of coarticulation. An accurate phoneme recognition utility is required as the current Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for automatic speech recognition systems that exhibit some errors for new words from the vocabulary (OOV). This method by Kotwal and Alam uses standard phoneme recognition algorithms for Mi."}, {"heading": "2.2 Phonetic Feature Table:", "text": "With its phonetic characteristics, a phoneme can be specifically identified, as S. King notes in his paper \"Speech recognition via phonetic characteristics syllables\" (1998). There are a total of 53 phonemes in Bangla language. Twenty-two phonetic characteristics are required to represent all Bangla phonemes. Twenty-two PFs for each phoneme are silence, short silence, stop, nasal, bilabial, friction, fluid, lenis, vowel, front, middle, back, silent, long, short, diphthong, low, medium, round, non-round and glottal.Hassan el al. (2013) in their paper \"Bangla phonetic feature table construction automatic speech recognition,\" they have implemented an ASR system based on phonetic characteristics."}, {"heading": "2.3 Phonetic Features Enhancement:", "text": "An investigation by Kabir and Rasel (2015) suggests a phonetic feature extraction method (PF) for Bangla for continuous, high-performance text recognition in an automatic speech recognition system (ASR). The method consists of three steps: First, a multi-layered neural network (MLN) is used to map continuous acoustic characteristics, local features (LFs) to PFs; second, it contains inhibitory / enhancement functions (In / En) to distinguish whether the dynamic patterns of the PF pathways are convex or concave; third, it improves patterns for convex patterns and inhibits them for concave patterns; third, it normalizes the PF vector using the Gram-Schmidt algorithm; and then performs a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based classifier. This feature extraction method offers a higher sentence correction rate (SCR), word correction rate (WR), and word accuracy (WM), which were not integrated into the methods (compared to the WA)."}, {"heading": "3. RESULT AND ANALYSIS", "text": "Their proposed strategy gives a higher phoneme and sentence correction rate than the methods previously studied. They have a phoneme correction rate of 53.5%, 56.50%, 59.70% and 70.78%, while the existing method during this period has a phoneme correction rate of 53%, 50.50%, 0.25% and 70.37% phoneme correction rate for the mixing components of 1.2.4 and 32. Due to the use of the phonetic function table by ASR, its proposed method (PF: dim-22) has a better result than the base system MFCC: di0.0.50 0.25% and 70.37% phoneme correction rate for the mixing components of 1.2.4 and 32.
