However, studies of statistical MT for low-resource languages always face the challenge of obtaining enough data to support a particular approach. Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) uses statistical methods based on large parallel bilingual corpora of source and target languages to create a statistical translation model. These two models and a search (decoding) module are used to decode this system and find the best translation for each source language (Brown et al. 1993; Koehn, Och & Marcu 2003)."}, {"heading": "1.1 Using a Pivot Language", "text": "Recent research on multilingual SMT focuses on the use of pivot languages as a solution to overcome language resource constraints (Gispert & Mario 2006; Utiyama & Isahara 2007; Wu & Wang 2007; Bertoldi et al. 2008; Philipp, Alexandra & Ralf 2009; Paul et al. 2011; Nakov & Ng 2012) Pivot-based machine translation refers to the use of an intermediate language, the so-called pivot language, to translate from the source language into the target language. Unlike typical MT systems that translate directly from the source language into the target language, pivot-based systems sequentially translate from the source language into the target language and then from the pivot language. (Utiyama & Isahara 2007) define two famous pivot strategies; i.e. sentence translation and phrase translation in the target language that are translated directly from the source language into the target language."}, {"heading": "Ebrahim Ansari, M.H.

Therefore, the authors decide to use the idea presented in (Aliguliyev 2009) to calculate sentences similarity of the source to pivot and destination to pivot parts. NGD uses the number of hits returned by Google to calculate the semantic distance between concepts (terms), the concepts are presented with their terms that are fed to the Google search engine as search terms. In (Aliguliyev 2009), a dissimilarity term is used instead of the similarity.

The first is the translation of sentences from Persian and the second is a translation from Italian as part of our primary comparable corpus. In this step, if we could find similar sentences in both English parts, the corresponding Persian and Italian sentences are likely translations of each other. To find similar sentences between two translated English parts of EnPr and EnIt, the IR system that was introduced (Rauf & Schwenk 2011) can be used."}, {"heading": "Ebrahim Ansari, M.H.

In addition to previous work, an additional similarity metric, Normalized Google Distance, is introduced."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Using IR system", "text": "Similar to the work of (Rauf & Schwenk 2011), we have used the Lemur Toolkit 2 (Ogilvie & Callan 2001) as an IR system: the day-specific filter is used taking into account the use of ID and date information for each sentence of both corpora. After the translation phase, we have two English corpora, one from Persian and one from Italian. The aim of the IR system is to find the best candidate sentences in EnIt (English from Italian) for each selected EnPr (English from Italian) sentence. In the first step, all sentences from EnPr for a given day (query sentences) and the corresponding articles from EnIt are collected in a multi-day window."}, {"heading": "Ebrahim Ansari, M.H.

To reduce it, the use of limited window days, such as \u00b1 5 days instead of larger windows or issuing fewer candidates, seems to be mandatory. To reduce the length of the query sentences and thereby increase the efficiency of the IR toolkit, stopwords are removed from the sentences. At this stage, the five best scoring sentences are returned through the IR process. Keep in mind that these best scoring sentences are in English. Therefore, for the next phases and finally for the parallel step of sentence extraction, the original sentences (i.e. Persian and Italian) are needed. If a defined ID is used in our implementation, corresponding Persian and Italian sentences from EnPr and EnIt are selected and sent to the next phase."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Modified IR with the new similarity measure", "text": "This similarity metric could calculate the similarity between the two sentences in one language and is very similar to the global version introduced in (Aliguliyev 2009) and fully described in Section 2.2. We have used our similarity metric in the IR system in two ways: firstly to filter sentences from the IR search space to shorten some process time; and secondly to combine the results with the Lemur scoring system to increase the efficiency of candidate selection; the IR process for each query set is very time consuming; due to this problem, we need to use a small window of time to reduce the number of extracted candidates for a reasonable process time. It is obvious that if we could reduce the search space for each query set, the IR process could be performed more quickly, and consequently we could use our IR system with a longer window of time or more candidate extraction."}, {"heading": "3.3 Filtering phase", "text": "The final phase of sentence extraction consists of selecting parallel sentences of candidates, which can be done with simple similarity indicators such as in (Up & Pan 2011). In addition, an additional filter method, the so-called inverted candidate translation strategy, is applied in our thesis. In the following subsections, the normal and the new extended version are checked respectively. In the last step of our work, we have introduced the tail removal method as in (Up & Pan 2011)."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Filtering based on candidate sentences", "text": "Although Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk (2011) stated that TER-selected sentences are slightly better than those selected by WHO and TERp, but because of the differences between our work and theirs, in our work we examined the three similarity metrics WHO, TER and TERp individually. WHO measures the number of operations needed to transform one sentence into the other (by counting the number of insertions, deletions and substitutions). It is obvious that there are many correct but different translations for each given sentence, each of which could be different not only in the choice of words but also in the order of words that WHO could not take into account. This problem is solved by TER, which could block sentences and thus take into account the formulation of 15 words."}, {"heading": "Ebrahim Ansari, M.H.

TERp (Snover et al. 2009) is an extension of TER and was one of the best performing metrics at the NIST Metric MATR Workshop 3 and had the highest absolute correlation, measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient, with human judgement in nine of the forty-five test conditions. TERp uses all TER editing operations (matches, inserts, deletions, substitutions, and shifts) as well as three new editing operations: root matches, synonym matches, and phrase translations. In general, TERp enables better sentence comparison by incorporating some kind of linguistic information about words. The filters introduced naturally impose a penalty for large length differences of two sentences, so sentence length filtering is not used in our work."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Filtering based on source to target translation", "text": "In this section we present another filtering method that differs from previous approaches. In this method, instead of checking translated parts (EnPr and EnIt) with each other to find the best sentence between candidates, the source for the target translation is used for further review. To this end, the third machine translation system, Persian-Italian SMT, is introduced. Existing training data for this machine translation system is not very extensive, so this system can only be used for this filter part. Initially, the ID is used for sentences in EnPr and EnIt (two translated corpora), the original sentences are retrieved from Persian and Italian primary corpora and are used for potentially best sentence pair selection. Consequently, there is a Persian sentence and N Italian candidates. Using Persian-Italian generated SMT, the Persian sentence is translated into Italian and by using one of the selected sentence similarity metrics (i.e. WHO, TER or TERp) the best candidate is selected from Italian sentences."}, {"heading": "4 Experimentation", "text": "In this section, the characteristics and effects of our parallel extraction system are evaluated, starting with the comparable corpora and the machine translation systems used in this thesis, Section 4-2 introduces the characteristics of extracted data with and without similarity metrics used in the IR system, the effects of applying different filtering strategies, and finally the effects of adding different extracted corpora to the training data of MT base systems."}, {"heading": "4.1 Used data and SMTs", "text": "In order to obtain our comparable corpora, we collected news from various Persian and Italian agencies between 2009 and 2012.

The extracted parallel corpus size was improved by using this similarity metric in the primary phase (before our R system), and we were able to reduce the actual threshold of the Ilara system by using another transformed time."}, {"heading": "Ebrahim Ansari, M.H.
