To this end, we integrated the scaled decision values of three different tools using the NFIS. To achieve a shorter runtime, we applied a BFS algorithm to detect more efficient characteristics among all characteristics. Based on the experimental results, our proposed method has almost promising results compared to individual tools. It seems that consideration of a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity is necessary for further investigation. Nevertheless, due to the limitation of our benchmark dataset, we experimented only with grayscale images, while adapting the methodology to color images may be difficult. We reiterate that reducing runtime was not our main concern. Nevertheless, we observed that reducing the number of characteristics of Learning may be carried out with the positive effect of the recently developed learning methods, such as further studies."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Most of researches on image forensics have been mainly focused on detection of artifacts introduced by a single processing tool.
