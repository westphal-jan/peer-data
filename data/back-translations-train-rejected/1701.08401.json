INTRODUCTIONGRAPHS are powerful mathematical models to represent complex data structures such as networks [1]. Spectral graph theory supports an important class of methods for studying graph topology and analyzing graph signals. Graph partitioning problems [2] can be solved as a convex relaxation of the graph-section criterion, which returns to the self-decomposition of the graph Laplacian. Thresholding the eigenvector with the smallest non-zero eigenvalue - commonly referred to as a vector by Fiedler - leads to a graph bipartition [3]. These eigenvectors also solve the embedding problem; i.e., mapping the nodes to a line (or higher-dimensional space) so that the distance between connected nodes is minimized."}, {"heading": "II.

Slepian\u2019s Time-Frequency Concentration Problem", "text": "In seminal work by Slepian, Landau, and Pollak [7], [8], the fundamental problem of the optimal concentration of a signal in the temporal and spectral ranges has been solved. Here, we will briefly consider the 1-D discrete-discrete concentration, which is directly relevant to the generalization we will introduce in this work. We will define the unitary discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) for a length N signal of N \u00b7 N matrixF = 1 \u221a N [ej\u03c9l (k \u2212 1)] k, l, l = 1, N, where the unitary discrete Fourier transformation (N \u2212 1) / 2e. Then, the signal is represented as vector f NS, where Fourier can be transformed as f = FHf, where \u00b7 H points to the Hermitian transpose."}, {"heading": "B. Graph Fourier Spectrum", "text": "For an undirected weighted graph with N nodes, connectivity is characterized by an N-N symmetrical adjacence matrix A in which the elements Ai, j indicate the edge weights between the nodes i, j = 1,..., N. Here, we assume that the graph is connected and the edge weights are positive. In addition to the graph and its topology, we can also consider graph signals that define an assignment from the nodes to a length-N vector that assigns a value to each node; for example, graph topology can model the presence of communication connections between nodes, while the graph signal can represent measures taken at the nodes. The graph is defined as an L-N vector, where D is the diagonal degree matrix with the elements Di, i-N j = 1Ai, j. Further, we can look at the presence of its own spectrum between the nodes."}, {"heading": "C. Slepians on Graphs", "text": "To generalize slepians to graphs, we follow the approach of [11], which is based on the introduction of selectivity and bandwidth. Firstly, selectivity can easily be specified by a subset of nodes S containing the NS nodes in which we aim for an optimal energy concentration. Similar to the classic 1-D case, we can represent the subgraph by the selection matrix S. Secondly, we propose to restrict the spectrum to eigenvectors with the NW < N smallest eigenvalues. We can then look at the truncated graph spectrum matrix UW of size N \u00d7 NW; i.e. any bandlimited graph signal can be represented by g = UWg. Similar to the 1-D case previously outlined, we find the linear combination of eigenvectors within the band boundary NW and with the maximum energy in S back to optimize the Rayleigh quotient size."}, {"heading": "III.

In this setting, gi = \u00b1 1, the labels of the nodes indicate that can be relaxed in order to take any real values."}, {"heading": "IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "text": "We proposed two drafts to obtain Slepian graph signals, which can be parameterized by selecting the sub-graph and the bandwidth. The latter provides a handle on the amount of \"global\" information that can be used to optimize the energy concentration or to embed the distance in the sub-graph. Interestingly, when NW N approaches without selecting the sub-graph, the concentration matrix of the first draft becomes identity, while it is applicable to the conventional laplacian for the second draft. In practice, Slepian optimization itself is a low-dimensional self-decomposition of a matrix of size NW \u00d7 NW, which can be achieved with efficient large-scale solving [13], to a widely used software library such as ARPACK.
