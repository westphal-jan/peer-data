Triphones : extraction & analysis", "text": "Basically, a triphone is a sequence of three phonemes. Inevitably, one could say that it is a 3rd order Markov chain or a trigram about phonemes. Seen from the Markov assumption, it could be called the probability of the third phoneme in the face of the first two phonemes. In other words, in a chain of long utterances, this model considers all previous phonemes irrelevant except the previous two. Formally, a triphone is expressed in a sequence, i.e. (pl \u2212 p \u2212 pr). Here, pl characterizes the telephone that occurs before p and pr is one that follows it. Table V shows how monophones and triphones would represent the sequence of the word \"Ant.\" By observing the ability to characterize the environment of a given phoneme, contextual telephone units, i.e. triphons, are extensively applied to language technology and have an immense influence on the development of language and the unit described above, in order to motivate us to choose the unit for the synthesis."}, {"heading": "B. Phonetic Richness Metric Used", "text": "Before discussing the process of extracting phonetically rich sentences, a metric is developed to measure the phonetic wealth of a sentence, which must be formalized in solving the problem. As a greedy algorithm is used for sentence selection on the basis of the contained triphone, a probabilistic metric is developed to pre-select and classify the sentences based on the density of the triphone it has. Metric takes the probability of each triphone that exists in the corpus to select the high-level sentences, preferring the sentences to consist of rarest triphons over the sentences that consist of the most frequent triphons. It was implemented by adding the reciprocal probability (calculated on the corpus) of each triphon to the sentence. Formally, the complete scenario can be described more clearly in the following way: View that the corpus K consists of a set of sentences S = {s1, s2, s3, sn}."}, {"heading": "C.
