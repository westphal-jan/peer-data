Usually, the attributes of the various attributes in relation to the concept of \"man,\" length, color are also one-dimensional attributes in relation to the concept of \"box,\" but they are multi-dimensional attributes in relation to the concept of \"space.\" It is worth noting that a multi-dimensional attribute can usually be determined by several one-dimensional attributes.
