INTRODUCTION", "text": "One of the most pronounced examples is seasonal affective disorder - a prolonged lack of sunlight that can depresse people. [2] Weather indirectly influences various aspects of our lives: work and study, buying habits, and more. In this work, we study the effects of the weather on television habits. In particular, we study whether people watch different types of programming under different weather conditions. This knowledge can have several important effects. First, marketers may be willing to adjust the content and ratio of advertising to the audience they will be exposed to [1]. Second, television and video recommendation systems could use this knowledge and adjust their recommendations accordingly [5]."}, {"heading": "2. CAUSAL ANALYSIS", "text": "The problem of estimating causal effects from observational data is central to numerous disciplines [3]. It can be formalized as follows.

Then unit i has two potential outcomes, Yi: i (1) when the unit is treated and Yi (0) otherwise. The causal effect of the treatment is the difference treated in Ybor = i (i)."}, {"heading": "3. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this paper, we used a dataset compiled by a national Australian IPTV provider. We obtained the complete Australian protocols over a 26-week period, from February to September 2012 [5]. The dataset contains 10M viewing events from approximately 40k users who watched more than 11k unique programs across 14 TV genres. We also obtained the geographical locations of users and matched them with their weather. In addition, we extracted eight attributes that characterize different aspects of the weather (Table 1)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "We apply the causality framework of Section 2 to our data sets. As we explain our setup, we illustrate it on an example question, \"does the high temperature cause us to see more drama?\" We define a treatment variable for each weather attribute treatment. For each treatment, we treat the events in the distribution of this attribute. That is, if the tail of the distribution is on the left (right), we point 20% of the events with the lowest (highest) value to the treatment group. For each treatment, we treat the events in the distribution of this attribute. That is, if the tail of the distribution is on the left (right), we point to the events with the lowest (highest) values."}, {"heading": "3.2 Results", "text": "Fig. 1 (a) shows the normalized ATTs (1) of pressure on 8 popular genres. We observe that when pressure is low, the frequency of watching dramas decreases by 5%. The same effect is observed for both user profiles, strengthening the validity of our results. Fig. 1 (b) shows the significant effects for all weather-genre combinations. We measure the importance of ATT by its estimate divided by its standard error, which is its standard deviation. Therefore, the value of 4 (\u2212 4) means that the estimate 4 is standard deviation above (below) zero and significant at p. 10 \u2212 4. We observe that many significant changes in Fig. 1 (b) are stable in our two profile representations. The correlation coefficient between the values in the two graphs is as high as 0.949, indicating that the causal dependencies are consistent regardless of the profile representation."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we perform a causal analysis of the weather on television habits, using two representations of user profiles that reveal similar dependencies. To our knowledge, this is the first causal analysis of a large database that examines the interaction between weather and television. It is worth noting that our work is domain agnostic, but some attributes, such as humidity and precipitation, are clearly related. We believe that a certain domain knowledge could help us refine the set of influential attributes and significantly improve our results. We believe that the weather dependencies detected can be incorporated into a context-aware recommendation to improve their recommendations, and leave this to future work."}], "references": [{"title": "How effective is targeted advertising?
