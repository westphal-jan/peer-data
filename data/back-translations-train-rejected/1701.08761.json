Research is focused on developing systems that provide need-based assistance for retention of such residual skills. This paper describes a novel cognitive collaborative control architecture C3A, designed to address the challenges of developing need- based assistance for wheelchair navigation. Organization of C3A is detailed and results from simulation of the proposed architecture is presented. For simulation of our proposed architecture, we have used ROS (Robot Operating System) as a control framework and a 3D robotic simulator called USARSim (Unified System for Automation and Robot Simulation).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 11:53:59 GMT  (1790kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08761v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["rupam bhattacharyya", "adity saikia", "shyamanta m hazarika"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08761"}, "pdf": {"name": "1701.08761.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "C3A: A Cognitive Collaborative Control Architecture For an Intelligent Wheelchair", "authors": ["Rupam Bhattacharyya", "Adity Saikia", "Shyamanta M Hazarika"], "emails": ["rupam15@tezu.ernet.in", "rupam15@tezu.ernet.in"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Collaborative Control, ROS, USARSim, 3D Robot Simulator"}, {"heading": "1.

Background", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Approaches related to human-robot co-operation", "text": "Cooperation between humans and robots addresses several relationships between them. As there is a considerable difference in the ability of users to control a wheelchair, the contribution of the system to control plays an important role. According to [9], control approaches in which humans and robots (or machines) work together to achieve a common goal are divided into the following categories: \u2022 secure operation and \u2022 shared control. In secure operation, robots are fully controlled by the user and robots occasionally take over the opportunity to avoid potential hazards [9]. Table 1 will help readers understand the basic principle of some well-known common control approaches for collaboration between humans and robots. It is difficult to discuss all of these approaches and their differences with collaborative control. Namely, two survey papers [24] and [1] are a good starting point for research into collaboration between humans and robots. From the discussion so far; collaborative control seems to be the best for patient rehabilitation."}, {"heading": "2.2. Cognitive agent: requirement and design principle", "text": "The embodiment of cognition within an intelligent agent will foster interaction between human robots. To generate rational behavior in an external environment, the agent should be embedded in a well-established cognitive architecture such as ACT-R [19] or SOAR [20]. The conceptual understanding behind a rational agent and its behavior in our context is explained below: Rational Agent: \"A system that makes decisions by taking into account all possible actions and selecting the one that leads to the most anticipated outcome can be treated as a rational agent.\" [37] Rational behavior in human-robot collaboration is to support the user whenever necessary, and our cognitive agent helps us achieve this behavior. However, selecting a particular cognitive architecture to address a particular HCI problem is enormously difficult. Our goal is to use a popular cognitive architecture and to incorporate into it specific characteristics in order to have these collaborative architectures work together, as there are no architectures."}, {"heading": "3. C3A : Cognitive Collaborative Control Architecture", "text": "The proposed cognitive collaborative control architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. It is inspired by the work [11] and the adaptation of the established cognitive architecture ACT-R [19]. C3A is a multi-layered architecture with the following layers: \u2022 user interface, \u2022 superior control layer and \u2022 local control layer. The functionality of each layer and the interdependence between them are described below."}, {"heading": "3.1. User Interface Layer", "text": "We assume that the user of our system is visually active. User Interface Layer helps the user navigate the P3AT through the labyrinth using the keyboard, which is used by users to interact with the rest of the C3A layers. The wheelchair is used by people who have either a physical or cognitive disability or both. Therefore, it is essential for us to determine how much help should be provided to the patient to keep his remaining abilities intact. There are various effective tests to measure the current state of the patient's health. In [9] they have performed five tests to calculate the cognitive / physical disability value. The method we use to calculate the score can be found in subsection 4.3. This score is stored in the process memory of the memory module for future use. Later, the score is passed on to the heuristic engine of the reactive module for further processing."}, {"heading": "3.2. Superior Control Layer", "text": "This layer consists of two sub-modules: \u2022 Reactive module and \u2022 Reactive navigator."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Reactive Module", "text": "This module is one of the most important modules for the proper functioning of the wheelchair."}, {"heading": "3. Interaction Layer", "text": "This submodule acts as a communication backbone for the entire architecture. It interacts simultaneously with the heuristic machine, the memory module and the reactive navigator. Thus, we have two communication paths. \u2022 Heuristic Engine-Interaction Layer-Reactive Navigator \u2022 Memory Module-Interaction Layer-Reactive Navigator a. Heuristic Engine-Interaction Layer-Reactive Navigator: Heuristic Engine provides us with the intelligent driver at all times using the processual memory. From the user interface layer (see Figure 1), the processual memory receives cognitive results (no label), the target position (Label 3 of Figure 1) and the agent position (Label 6 of Figure 1). This three pieces of information are used by heuristic engine to form two metrics (explained in Section 4.1) for intelligent driver selection and interaction 1."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Reactive Navigator", "text": "Before building a reactive navigator, system designers must be very focused in the speed-sensitive parts of the cognitive architecture. In, improving speed-sensitive information, ROS introduces a new concept called \"nodelets,\" which helps us to build a reactive controller. These are almost comparable to conventional nodes, but many important functions are embedded in them. Reactive Navigator consists of two submodules that are part of the ROS control framework: \u2022 Automated Navigator of ROS and \u2022 Patient as Driver. a. Automated Navigator of ROS: ROS is composed of the number of complex tools and libraries. The inclusion of details about automated navigator will make the architecture in Figure 1 clumsy. Our motivation is that the complexity of ROS should not dominate the understanding of our control architecture. The automated navigator of ROS is the machine in our approach. Planning is essential for guiding the agent autonomously without causing damage."}, {"heading": "3.3. Local Control Layer", "text": "This layer corresponds to the 3D USARSim simulator, in which both the P3AT robot and the labyrinth environment exist at the same time. P3AT robot uses the laser rangefinder SICK LMS200. It can be extended with many other sensors. This sensor is an integral part of the local control layer. All actuators are also part of this layer. Whenever the active ingredient is tested in real time, we need a real-time wheelchair. All sensors, actuators and other hardware-related aspects present in P3AT must be embedded in the real-time wheelchair."}, {"heading": "4. Simulation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1. Evaluation Metrics", "text": "There are many metrics that are based on human performance. It is the experimental evaluation of the collaborative control of the P3S, two types of metrics that are taken into account. \u2022 Condition is metric and robotic. \u2022 Condition is that we put the cognitive abilities of the user in the foreground."}, {"heading": "4.2. Experimental Set Up", "text": "To start the services of different ROS nodes, a universal launch file is created. Simulation begins with a \"form filling\" process of the user, and then the test arena, which is the labyrinth environment, is started. This labyrinth is designed using the \"Unreal Development Kit\" embedded in the USARSim simulator. The same labyrinth is used to test all participants, except the test arena, every other utility is provided via ROS nodes. Table 5 gives a detailed specification of the functionality of various ROS nodes and their correspondence with C3A. Experimentation can only begin after all the nodes mentioned in Table 5 work reliably. 3.3Interested readers can access https: / / drive.google.com / file / 0BwgHQRnAyRbgWXhdWxlN0ctU0k / view? etc = sharing the preview of the snapshot of our entire system."}, {"heading": "4.3. Experimentation", "text": "The cognitive collaborative control architecture is evaluated in terms of its effectiveness by comparing the maneuvering time (total time from start to finish) in the following modes: 1. Human (stand-alone mode), 2. Machine (stand-alone mode) and 3. Collaborative control mode. The cognitive score of the subjects is based on the questionnaire from Table 6. The questions are adapted from standard essays Instrumental Activities of Daily Life (IADL) [27] and Folstein Test or Mini-Mental State Assessment (MMSE) [33]. The questionnaire can be used as a tool for analyzing the participants in a short time. Six subjects are randomly selected, each of them must complete the questionnaire; the cognitive score is evaluated. There are two groups of people; Group A with a high cognitive score (HCS) and Group B with a low cognitive score (LCS), all of them must pass through the questionnaire; the cognitive score is evaluated."}, {"heading": "5. Results", "text": "Figure 7 reports on the manoeuvring time (in seconds) required by all six subjects to achieve the predefined goal. All three modes described in subsection 4.3 are represented in Figure 7. Machine time for different runs is different, due to the way the machine navigates and the user has nothing to do with it. The machine in our case is the automated navigator of ROS. This navigator generates a different recovery behavior based on the dynamic construction of Costmap. Costmap is built with the laser scans from SICK LMS200 Laser Range Finder. A single laser scan could not arrive in the same time window between two sets of experiments leading to a different costmap and thus to a behavior. The performance of the collaborative mode vis-\u00e0-vis-\u00e0-vis the human user (standalone mode) is compared to evaluate the system. Autonomous navigation of ROS is highly configurable, enabling the use of a large number of algorithms."}, {"heading": "6. Final Comments", "text": "ROS overcomes this limitation due to its acoustic messaging and shared memory concept. The wheelchair control that permeates C3A is aware of its location, driver quality, and other environmental factors such as proximity to the shared destination through the memory module. The navigation commands of the user and the wheelchair are simultaneously active through the ROS theme. Assistive wheelchair with collaborative control is achieved through C3A through ROS, an approach for embodying cognition. ROS contains all the functions needed to build an effective collaborative device. The limitations of our approach are mentioned below: - Our initial six-participant result is used to show that our approach has some positive directions. Strict tests with more users are possible once we implement the entire memory module. In our future work, we are trying to implement more evaluation metrics and rigorous statistical analyses to improve our approach to the control module, to integrate them into the overall simulation that is in the control module."}], "references": [{"title": "Human-robot collaboration: a survey", "author": ["A.
