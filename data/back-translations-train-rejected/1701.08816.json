Training Model", "text": "The data were first normalized by subtracting the mean and then scaling using the standard deviation, and then divided into training and test sets. To make the paper comparable to images of one of the following resolutions, most of the results of our work correspond to the 256 x 256 image resolution. To optimize the model, we used the Adaptive Momentum Stimulation (ADAM) method [34], which uses an adaptive learning rate approach for each parameter, storing the decreasing average of the past two square gradients and past gradients. We varied different initial gradients to find the most stable convergence and 10 \u2212 5 and 5 \u00b0, thus fixing the most reasonable 5 \u2212 5 decisions, using the lower convergence compared to the latter."}, {"heading": "C.

Timing Performance", "text": "Table II shows an overview of the proposed architectures with PC run times measured with Intel (R) Xeon (R) CPU E5-2650 v3 @ 2.30 GHz CPU and GeForce GTX TitanX GPU with 12 GB of memory. To the best of our knowledge, our method is currently the fastest segmentation approach for CXR images. With modern hardware, it can process thousands of images per day, which is particularly beneficial in large clinical environments where hundreds or sometimes thousands of people are checked daily."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach for multi-class segmentation of anatomical organs in CXR scans. We introduce and evaluate a total of three completely revolutionary architectures that achieve high test scores on public JSRT data sets that exhibit or exceed the original U-Net architecture and other state-of-the-art methods on all organs. Our best architecture outperforms the results of the human observer in the lungs and heart. Clavicle segmentation is still a challenging task for our architectures, even though they are much closer to the values of the human observer than any other state-of-the-art method before. Overall, results show that simply more regulation and the extraction of greater number of abstract features at a high level can be beneficial for improving the segmentation of smaller objects such as collarbones. Including weighting in the loss function is critical when dealing with the highly unbalanced data, which in CXR images is the case of smaller objects such as collarbones, where it exceeds the best function of 4.1%, with a loss of 8 times the original architecture, and nearly exceeds the best parameter of 8%."}], "references": [{"title": "Deep learning", "author": ["Y.

Networks on image classification and recognition tasks has led to new applications in very diversifying contexts. One of these is medical imaging where scarcity and imbalance of training data has hindered rapid development of neural network related applications. This paper investigates and proposes neural network architectures within the context of automated segmentation of anatomical organs in chest radiographs, namely for lung, clavicles and heart. By relating prior class data distributions to the objective function sparsely represented structures are methodologically emphasized. Scarce training sets and data augmentation are encountered with aggressive data regularization. The problem of highly imbalanced target object appearance in the input data is solved by modifying the objective function. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available JSRT database consisting of 247 X-Ray images the ground-truth masks for which available in the SCR database. The networks have been trained in a multi-class setup with three target classes. Our best performing model trained with the negative Dice loss function was able to reach mean Jaccard overlap scores of 94.1% for lungs, 86.6% for heart and 88.7% for clavicles in the multi-label setup, therefore, outperforming the best state-of-the art methods for heart and clavicle and human observer on lung and heart segmentation tasks.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
