As part of the program, awardees were asked to address one of the following \u201cblue sky\u201d questions: 1. How could/should Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses incorporate ethics into the curriculum? 2. How could we teach AI topics at an early undergraduate or a secondary school level? 3. AI has the potential for broad impact to numerous disciplines. How could we make AI education more interdisciplinary, specifically to benefit non-engineering fields? This paper is a collection of their responses, intended to help motivate discussion around these issues in AI education. Bridging Across Disciplines Claudia Schulz (Imperial College London) The application of AI methods to problems such as legal decision making, language translation, or gene analysis often requires the cooperation of AI experts and subject specialists, e.g., lawyers, translators, or biologists. Their ability to communicate on a common ground is a crucial factor determining the success of the project. It is thus beneficial if both parties have a basic understanding of the subject as well as of AI methods, even before the start of a project. Universities provide a unique opportunity to both teach students becoming AI experts some subject knowledge (e.g., biology or law) and ensure that students in non-computing subjects have a basic understanding of AI techniques. A na\u0131\u0308ve approach for achieving such interdisciplinary learning is that AI students take some first-year subject courses, and subject students some introductory AI courses. Even though Copyright c \u00a9 2017 by the author(s). All rights reserved. this approach is easy to implement, it may not achieve the intended interdisciplinary learning benefits since the courses are not tailored towards students of a different discipline (even first-year courses often provide a detailed introduction to a specific topic instead of surveying a whole field). We here discuss two approaches based on peer-learning, which provide a more beneficial interdisciplinary learning environment. They share the idea that AI and subject students learn together by teaching each other. In the seminar-style approach, AI students give seminars to subject students (and vice versa). These seminars may, for example, provide an overview of AI techniques or review applications of AI methods in subject areas. This approach does not only benefit the attending subject students, who acquire knowledge tailored particularly to them, but also provides valuable experience to the AI student giving the seminar in explaining AI topics to the lay audience. There is clearly a lot of variability concerning the exact setup of these seminars: they can be given by a single PhD student or by a group of undergraduates, and the attendees\u2019 background can be a mixture of subjects or a single subject (in which case the seminar will cover topics and examples related to this particular subject). In contrast to the seminar-style approach, where the speaker teaches the audience, the project-based approach promises mutual teaching and learning, both in terms of knowledge and skills. In this setting, an AI student and a subject student work together on a project trying to solve a problem in the subject student\u2019s area by applying AI techniques. At the start, the subject student explains subjectspecific background to the AI student, whereas the AI student teaches the subject student about possible AI techniques to be used, thus creating a mutual teaching and learning environment. During the project, students will also acquire the invaluable skills of working in an interdisciplinary team. Again, there are different setups for such projects: The problem(s) to be solved can be given by faculty or be the students\u2019 own ideas, and the project can be part of a course or an extra-curricular \u201cideas/start-up lab\u201d. Student-Centric Discovery Francesco Maurelli (Jacobs University Bremen) Most approaches in university teaching are based on frontal lectures, sometimes with specific lab activities and specific homeworks. The course is divided in specific modules which are explained sequentially. I would be interested in analysing the feasibility (and try that with a real course) of a more student-centric approach, inspired by the pedagogical Montessori method (Montessori and George 1964). Although the main focus of the method has always been on children, some of those elements have been incorporated with success in secondary-school and early-undergraduate levels. Working with an equipped lab is fundamental for this approach. Then I would imagine that each student (or maybe each group of students) could freely decide the direction of the course, based on discovery and on what they are interested in. I have recently started a cooperation with Prof. Federico Gobbo at the University of Amsterdam, to analyse the portability of some key elements of the Montessori method into AI education of young adults (so, the target group of this call). From one side, I am interested to see how the Montessori method applied at a later age group than usual could help the students in their personal and professional development. I strongly believe that independence and the ability of thinking, reasoning, and making informed choices are key elements of the lives of active and engaged human beings, part of the society. A teaching approach which values independent thinking seems therefore a very interesting and potentially fruitful approach, albeit maybe difficult at times. From the other side, looking for new engaging methods of teaching AI and robotics might result in students approaching the subject with curiosity and willingness, not just because it is in the study plan. This in turn might result in more people engaged in AI and Robotics, and in more passion towards the subject. It might be perceived not just as one of many lectures, but a feel of \u201cownership\u201d might push for a deeper understanding of specific subjects rather than usual frontal lectures. Challenges in this approach would be ensuring that each student (or each group of students) progress and explore the subject within some boundaries. Also, evaluation is a very delicate subject. In the original Montessori approach there is no grading for children, but it is something usually necessary in undergraduate courses. Establishing a fair grading system is something necessary, though it might be hard to compare different approaches and different paths that each student would undertake.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
