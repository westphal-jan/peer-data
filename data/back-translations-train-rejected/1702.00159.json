In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 08:33:21 GMT  (767kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00159v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["wei du", "yang tang", "sunney yung sun leung", "le tong", "athanasios v vasilakos", "feng qian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.00159"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.00159.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Robust Order Scheduling in the Fashion Industry: A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach", "authors": ["Wei Du", "Yang Tang", "Sunney Yung Sun Leung", "Feng Qian"], "emails": ["duwei0203@gmail.com;", "tangtany@gmail.com,", "yangtang@ecust.edu.cn;", "fqian@ecust.edu.cn).", "sunney.leung@polyu.edu.hk;", "tongle0328@gmail.com).", "vasilako@ath.forthnet.gr)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it will be able to take the lead, \"he said in an interview with the Taiwanese daily Le."}, {"heading": "II.

Problem Description", "text": "The robust order scheduling problem in the fashion industry is considered m production lines and n production orders, and n orders are assigned to suitable lines for production. An illustration is shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the order bar represents the duration of production of the respective order. 1) Description of the production line: The production lines consist of a number of different machines, so that a garment at the top of the line can start in its cut state and once come off the line. On a production line, the machines are responsible for cutting, embroidering, pressing and packaging, respectively; and sewing is the most time-consuming process. Since we focus on the effects of pre-production events and the uncertainties in daily production volume on fashion order scheduling to simplify the problem, we only consider the sewing process during production in this paper, rather than any processes. In this research, production lines are production specific lines, which means that the efficiency of the product is provided when it is lower than its peak."}, {"heading": "D. Objective Functions", "text": "The order scheduling problem investigated aims to create robust order schedules in the fashion industry that take into account both preproduction events and uncertainties in daily production volumes. In a timetable where an order is assigned to be processed one day before the current conservative start date, we say that there will be a collision of pre-production events; if the order is to be completed after its due date, we say that there will be delays in the delivery of that order. Therefore, we have two objectives for the robust order scheduling problems: 1) Minimize the total delay of all orders; 2) Minimize the total pre-production event collisions of all orders. Below, these two objectives are introduced in detail \u2212 The first goal is to minimize the delay of all orders described as follows: f1 = n Preproduction results j = 1h (Dj \u2212 FDj), as follows:"}, {"heading": "III.

Robust Multi-Objective Optimization", "text": "As stated in [15], robustness is introduced into multi-objective optimization by optimizing the effective mean functions instead of optimizing the original objective functions. Therefore, the robust multi-objective optimization problem can be formulated as follows: Problem: A solution x * is called a multi-objective robust solution if it is the globally feasible Pareto-optimal solution to the following multi-objective minimization problem (defined in relation to the neighborhood of a solution x): Minimization (f eff1 (x), f eff 2 (x),..., f eff M (x), x, (8), where f effi (x) is defined as follows: f effi (x) = 1 | B\u03b4 (x) | y-objective solutions (x) fi (x) dy, (9) B\u03b4 (x) is the neighborhood of a solution x, | b-effi-objective solutions are transformed in the manner."}, {"heading": "B.

In this research, NSJADE serves as an optimization tool in the optimization process, and the flow chart of NSJADE is provided in Fig. 3. In the optimization process, there are three important topics that we need to elaborate: coding scheme, population initialization, and population evaluation. Coding scheme and population initialization relate to the first field (characterized by the pattern) of the flow chart in Fig. 3, Population evaluation relates to the second and eighth field (characterized by the flow chart) of production in Fig. 3.1) Coding schemes: The first step of the optimization process is the coding of potential job resolutions in individuals."}, {"heading": "IV.

Experimental Information", "text": "The parameters of NSJADE are the same as in JADE [21]. It should be noted that in this essay we do not use the maximum number of function evaluations (MAX FES) to control the termination of NSJADE. The reason for this is that MAX FES relies on the value of H, which is the number of neighboring points of an individual. To easily control the termination of NSJADE, we use the maximum number of generations Gmax as a stop criterion. And Gmax = D \u00b7 E, where D is the dimensional size, is a predefined parameter that controls the evolutionary generations of the algorithm. The value of evolution is set as 10 according to the analysis in Section S.III in the supplementary file."}, {"heading": "B.

Comparison of Non-Robust and Robust Order Schedules by NSJADE", "text": "In this subsection, we will compare the non-robust and robust order schemes obtained in the experiments, which aim to illustrate the importance of introducing a robust multi-objective optimization in the order planning of problems in the fashion industry. Results are evident in Figure 6.From Figure 6, the obtained schedules show a balance between the two targets, i.e., the minimization of the total time of all orders and the minimization of the total pre-production events of all orders. The results show that if the daily production quantity of all orders is not specified, the uncertainty is taken into account, the PFs in Figure 6 are different from the cases without uncertainty. The differences appear due to the uncertain daily production quantity during production. In robust schemes, the daily production quantity of each order is allowed to vary within a given range, and we can say that the robust schematics-schematics-schematics-schematics-schematics-schematics-schematics-schematics-schematics-schematics-schematics-schematics-schematically-schematically-schematically-schematically-schematically-schematically-based on the uncertainty."}, {"heading": "D. Effect of \u03b2 on Robust Order Scheduling", "text": "In this section, we will examine the effects of uncertainty factor \u03b2 on robust order planning. \u03b2 is set as \u03b2 = [0,2, 0,3] and the results are presented in Fig. 7. From Fig. 7, it can be observed that as \u03b2 increases, the shift of the PF away from the original PF, i.e. the uncertainty is not taken into account. This phenomenon is natural, since the increase of \u03b2 brings more uncertainties in the daily production quantity of each order, which then leads to greater deviations from the original PF."}, {"heading": "E. Effect of H on Robust Order Scheduling", "text": "As described in section III-A, H adjacent solutions are selected to calculate the effective mean function effi. If more adjacent solutions are intuitively selected, the objective values are closer to the actual averages. In the previous experiments in this section, the value of H was set to 5. Here, we present the effects of the use of different H values on robust order planning problems in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 shows that the effective mean front with a small H overestimates the true robust front despite a shorter computing time. However, compared to H = 15, the effective mean front with H = 5 can also achieve a satisfactory approximation. In applications, the user can select the values of H according to the practical situation."}, {"heading": "F. Comparison with Existing MOEAs", "text": "To demonstrate the superiority of NSJADE, we compare it to two existing MOEAs 67: NSGA-II [20] and NSCDE [25]. The results are shown in Fig. 9. In this paper, the computing resource for each algorithm is limited (i.e., 800 generations). Therefore, we must select the algorithm that is strong enough to obtain solutions with better convergence performance with limited computing resources: JADE. In addition, Fig. 9 observes that in a fixed period of time during the search, the solutions achieved by NSJADE have the best convergence performance among the three MOEAs; and we award the powerful NSJADE search engine: JADE. Since boundaries are one of the most important components in a PF, in Table V we plot the averages of the PF boundaries achieved in each run of 30 runs for these three algorithms."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper discusses for the first time the problems of robust order planning in the fashion industry, which are an essential part of flexible and intelligent supply chain management. Pre-production events in garment manufacturing are taken into account for the first time, so the problem of order planning is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem. Furthermore, in this paper, the daily production volume of each order is considered unsafe with respect to most real production environments in the fashion industry, making the problem a robust, multi-objective optimization problem. And NSJADE is used to search the robust order programs.A number of experiments have been carried out. Observations from the experiments show that pre-production events strongly influence the arrangement of orders in the fashion industry. Furthermore, uncertainty in the daily production quantity of each order has a significant influence on the number of orders, including the corresponding number of adjacent ones."}, {"heading": "A. Fast Nondominated Sorting and Crowding-Distance Assignment", "text": "In our proposal for NSJADE, we maintain fast non-dominated sorting and overfill distance allocation, two effective mechanisms presented in NSGA-II. [20] After assessing the population, a fast non-dominated sorting approach is used to sort the population into different overfill distances with less computational complexity compared to the conventional approach. For each individual, the average distance of two individuals on either side of that individual along each of the targets is calculated, and the distance is referred to as overfill distance. If two individuals are on the same non-control level, the individual with a greater value of overfill distance is preferred. For further details of these two mechanisms, refer to [20]."}, {"heading": "B. Mutation and Crossover", "text": "In the developed NSJADE, adaptive differential evolution (JADE) is chosen as the search engine instead of the non-adaptive genetic algorithm to promote both the exploration and exploitation capability of the population. Therefore, the mutation and crossover strategies of JADE are adopted in NSJADE. Details of the mutation and crossover strategies can be found [21]."}, {"heading": "C. Selection", "text": "In a single evolution, after each individual in the parent population has undergone the mutation and crossover, a new generation has to be selected from the combined parent and offspring populations. It is assumed that the parent population contains NP individuals; therefore, after a single evolution in the candidate pool, there are 2NP individuals (each parent generates one offspring).Sort the population into different levels using the fast non-dominated sorting approach and calculate the displacement distance of each individual. The individual with the lower non-dominance level and the larger displacement distance is preferred; according to this principle, NP individuals from the candidate pool are selected as a population of a new generation.S.II ERIMENTAL SETUP In this section, we present the experimental setup in detail, including information from the test data, production orders and production lines."}, {"heading": "A. Test Data Information", "text": "The test data used in the following experiments comes from an enterprise software called Fast React [17]. Fast React is a production planning software for the fashion industry that takes into account practical factors in real production, such as pre-production effects, learning effects, etc. And Fast React is used by global fashion brands, retailers and leading global manufacturers involved in real business, from carpet, cloth and lace weavers to shoe manufacturers, apparel companies, etc. Fast React provides a lot of industrial data collected by their customers, and the data includes different types of orders and production lines, as well as information on the pre-production events of the orders. Therefore, this data is used as test data in our research. Although Fast React simulates real production in the fashion industry, it does not take into account various uncertainties that exist in real manufacturing. Furthermore, planners must manually place the orders on the production lines in Fast React, which is not intelligent."}, {"heading": "B.

In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
