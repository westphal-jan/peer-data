In the last decade, the content of the Indian language on various media types such as blogs, emails, websites and chats has increased significantly. With the advent of smartphones, more people have access to social media through WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, through which they share their opinions on people, products, organizations and governments. The wealth of social media data has created many new ways of accessing information, but has also led to many novel challenges. Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging is a fundamental task of Natural Language Processing. Many overarching NLP tasks require input as a posttagged sentence for parsing. The result of PoS tagging to English-Spanish code-mixed data has been in (Solorio and Liu, 2008) English."}, {"heading": "2 Rule based PoS Tagging", "text": "The task of developing systems for predicting PoS is therefore immensely complex. Before sending word tokens for classification, it is necessary to remove the inappropriate tokens, including all residuals, digits, emoticons, website links, and twitter-specific word tokens such as \"@,\" #, ~, \"and many more. To address the variations of such tokens in the test data, we are developing a rules-based system for sequential removal of one type after another. We started by removing all punctuations and their respective extensions such as...,\". \"and\" ~. \"Next, we tackled all numerical tokens, including tokens that begin with a numerical entry and end with\" st, \"\" nd, \"\" rd, \"\" th \"for markers such as.\""}, {"heading": "3 Feature Extraction", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of us will be able to move into a different world, in which they are able to live in, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live."}, {"heading": "4 Data Set & Experimental Setup", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Dataset", "text": "The data set used in the experiment is provided by the organizer of the PoS tagging tool competition at ICON2016 (Jamatia and Das, 2016), which consists of Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp statements on a fine and coarse-grained level.

We have used the default CRF + + setting throughout the experiment. Since CRF + + uses a predefined feature template to find 1https: / / taku910.github.io / crfpp / the optimal feature template, a number of experiments on training data sets have been conducted in cross-validation mode. However, we only match the feature template to English-Hindi data sets and used the optimal template for all three language pairs."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "For this joint task, we submitted two separate, restricted runs, which differ in the nature of their training, while the functionality remains the same: 1. Run-1: The system was trained by extending the training data of each language pair from all three social media platforms, namely Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Therefore, the same model was used to obtain the POS tag from Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp test data; 2. Run-2: The system was individually trained with only corresponding language pair training data from different social media platforms, namely Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Therefore, the Facebook-trained model Twitter and WhatsApp training data was used to obtain the POS tag from Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp test data. The same strategy was used for both coarse and fine-grained training data from different social media platforms, namely Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp."}, {"heading": "6 Future work and Conclusion", "text": "This article describes the approach to marking parts of the language on an ever finer and coarser level in Bengali-English, Hindi-English and Teluguan language pairing of code-mixed data. The system performed exceptionally well in all areas for finer and coarser tag sets, with the exception of the Telugu Twitter Constrained Run-2 on code-mixed tag sets. The team is currently working on the application of Deep Neural Networks in the task of PoS tagging. A lack of labelled data was the main cause of poor results in the application of Recurrent Neural Networks and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for the classification task. We are currently working on combining a CRF-based classification system and a Bi-Directional LSTM (BLSTM) model to improve results on code-mixed data sets."}], "references": [{"title": "Query word labeling and back transliteration for indian languages: Shared task system description", "author": ["Gella et al.2013] Spandana Gella", "Jatin Sharma", "Kalika Bali"], "venue": "FIRE Working Notes,", "citeRegEx": "Gella et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gella et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Task report: Tool contest on pos tagging for code-mixed indian social media (facebook, twitter, and whatsapp) text", "author": ["Jamatia", "Das2016] Anupam Jamatia", "Amitava Das"], "venue": "In Proceeding of ICON 2016", "citeRegEx": "Jamatia et al\\.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Jamatia et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Part-of-speech tagging for code-mixed english-hindi twitter and facebook chat messages", "author": ["Bj\u00f6rn Gamb\u00e4ck", "Amitava Das"], "venue": "RECENT ADVANCES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING,", "citeRegEx": "Jamatia et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Jamatia et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Improved part-of-speech tagging for online conversational text", "author": ["Brendan O\u2019Connor", "Chris Dyer", "Kevin Gimpel", "Nathan Schneider", "Noah A Smith"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Owoputi et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Owoputi et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "A universal part-of-speech tagset", "author": ["Petrov et al.2011] Slav Petrov", "Dipanjan Das", "Ryan McDonald"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1104.2086", "citeRegEx": "Petrov et al\\.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Petrov et al\\.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Part-of-speech tagging for english-spanish code-switched text", "author": ["Solorio", "Liu2008] Thamar Solorio", "Yang Liu"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,", "citeRegEx": "Solorio et al\\.,? \\Q2008\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Solorio et al\\.", "year": 2008}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 0, "context": "A language identification system developed by (Gella et al., 2013) used a simple heuristic approach to form chunks of data for the same language.", "startOffset": 46, "endOffset": 66}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "They apply a CRF-based PoS tagger for Hindi and Twitter POS tagger (Owoputi et al., 2013) for English, and map it to the Universal tagset (Petrov et al.", "startOffset": 67, "endOffset": 89}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": ", 2013) for English, and map it to the Universal tagset (Petrov et al., 2011).", "startOffset": 56, "endOffset": 77}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "In our literature survey on PoS tagging on social code-mixed data, we observe that Universal PoS tags (Petrov et al., 2011) are the most popular.", "startOffset": 102, "endOffset": 123}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "tagged using BIS tagset(Jamatia et al., 2015).", "startOffset": 23, "endOffset": 45}], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Use of social media has grown dramatically during the last few years.
