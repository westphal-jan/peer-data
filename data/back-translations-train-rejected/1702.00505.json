Experimental Setting", "text": "To evaluate our Design Space Exploration (DSE), we use the SLAMBench Framework with the ICL-NUIM [19], [18] dataset, in particular the first 400 frames of the living trajectory 2. We halved the original sequence to reduce the overall execution time of the benchmark; this was done after careful consideration that accuracy metrics are still representative of the entire sequence. Common approaches to performance optimization consider benchmark suites, which are generally a set of small cores extracted from real applications. One criticism of what can be learned from a benchmark suite is that they may not represent and capture well the complex interaction of cores in a real application. Our applications consist of more than 10 GPU-accelerated cores. They offer the ability to approach the exploration of parameters at the algorithmic level that are not possible with conventional benchmark suites. (During the following execution of the following two)"}, {"heading": "B. KFusion Design Space", "text": "In the case of the SLAMBench implementation of the KFusion algorithm, we have access to the listed parameters. For a detailed explanation of these parameters, see [30], [28]. \u2022 Volume Resolution: The resolution of the scene to be reconstructed. As an example, a 64x64x64 voxel grid captures less detail than a 256x256x256 voxel grid. \u2022 \u00b5 Distance: The output volume of KFusion is defined as a shortened signed distance function (TSDF) [30]. Each element (voxel) of the volume contains the most likely distance to the next visible surface, up to a truncation distance specified by the parameter \u00b5, also referred to as mu in the text. \u2022 Pyramid-level iterations: The number of block iterations performed during the construction of each layer of the image pyramid. \u2022 Compute size ratio: The fraction depth of the image resolution is used as the starting point for the fraction rate."}, {"heading": "C. ElasticFusion Design Space", "text": "The algorithmic parameters and thresholds taken into account in our study are: \u2022 ICP / RGB weight: Relative ICP / RGB tracking weight. Incremental pose estimates are made in both photometric RGB space and geometric depth space. Then the results are merged by applying this weight parameter. \u2022 Depth truncated: cutoff distance for depth processing. The algorithm ignores the raw depth that is greater than this threshold. \u2022 Reliability threshold: Surf confidence threshold. As a surf confidence threshold, more is observed, the confidence of the surf increases. As soon as the confidence of the surf is greater than a threshold, it is included in the processing pipeline."}, {"heading": "D. Multi-Objective Optimization Goal", "text": "In the context of multi-target optimisation, there is generally no single solution that minimises all performance indicators at the same time. Therefore, attention is paid to pareto-optimal solutions - i.e. solutions that cannot be improved in any of the objectives without affecting at least one of the other objectives."}, {"heading": "E. Design Space Exploration Tool", "text": "The algorithmic parameter space we are investigating is too large to be fully evaluated on the hardware platform; we use HyperMapper in [40] a cheaper route of training, a predictive machine learning model based on a handful of examples (points in the parameter space) that are evaluated on hardware; HyperMapper accurately creates a surrogate model and predicts performance over the entire parameter space, while being many orders of magnitude faster than applying it to hardware via a video sequence for large parameter settings. Since we do not know performance over the parameter space, we are also unaware of the points for which a physical experiment will be conducted that will be most informative, in terms of achieving the greatest increase in accuracy of our model - a classic chicken and egg problem. Thus, we resort to bootstrapping predictive models (two separate randomized decision forests of precision) for accuracy and run-time prediction from a small number of random examples."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this section, we describe how we evaluated our design space exploration, starting with a more detailed description of the target platforms (Section IV-A), and then briefly summarizing our key findings (Section IV-B), before going into Section IV-C in more detail on the results of the generalization of HyperMapper. To ensure completeness and comparability, we will partially report the results of our previous work on HyperMapper and the design space exploration for the KFusion benchmark [40]."}, {"heading": "A. Platforms", "text": "For our experiments we use a hardkernel ODROID-XU3 platform based on the Samsung Exynos 5422, an ASUS T200TA with an Intel Atom Z3795, and a desktop computer with an NVIDIA GTX 780 Ti GPU. The Exynos 5422 contains a Mali-T628-MP6 GPU in addition to ARMs big.LITTLE heterogeneous multi-processor solution consisting of four Cortex-A15 \"great\" performance tuned out of the Intel processor line, and four Cortex-A7 \"LITTLE\" energy tuned in the processor line. The Mali-T628-MP6 GPU consists of two separate OpenCL devices: one with four cores and another with two. In our experiments we only use the 4-core OpenCL OpenCL, which excludes the partitioning tasks on multiple GPU devices. The Mali-T6MP6 kernel version with two additional cores consists of one OpenCPL and two separate cores."}, {"heading": "B. Outcome in a glance", "text": "We observe that the standard KFusion configuration provides a frame rate of 6 FPS on the embedded system ODROID-XU3 and has a similar accuracy ATE compared to the standard configuration (4.47 cm), and these results are consistent on the ASUS machine. In addition, the best configurations selected work across a wide range of 83 mobile platforms through crowdsourcing. On these platforms, the Android version of SLAMBench, which was configured using the Pareto front, runs at speeds from 2 to 12 above default. We observe that the standard ElasticFusion configuration provides a frame rate of 45 FPS on the NVIDIA desktop machine. Our design space exploration results show significantly better frame rates and better accuracy. For example, there is a configuration that has a refresh rate of 25.69 FPS compared to the standard configuration, compared to a 1.5x improvement over the standard configuration."}, {"heading": "C. Exploration", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "D. Crowd-sourcing", "text": "An Android app was developed for SLAMBench's KFusion benchmark [5]. People can download the SLAMBench app free of charge and automatically execute the most powerful (best runtime) algorithmic configuration from the Pareto front calculated on the ODROID XU3 board, along with the default configuration to compare their devices. For practical reasons, only 100 frames are executed, and the app collects the results automatically and sends them over the network to a central database for analysis. In total, the app ran on 83 platforms. Figure 5 shows this crowdsourcing experiment. The graph shows the acceleration over the standard configuration running on the same device. Acceleration ranges from 2 to more than 12. This result confirms the hypothesis that the most powerful configurations found on one machine usually work well on other but similar machines."}, {"heading": "V. RELATED WORK", "text": "In this context, new challenges were highlighted, such as the Low-Power Image Recognition Challenge (LPIRC 2016), which emphasizes the importance of low-power implementations of computer visions. In this context, SLAMBench [28] enabled quantitative, comparable and validable experimental research in the form of a benchmark framework for understanding 3D scenarios."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "3D scene understanding algorithms are generally complex and depend on a number of parameters that subtly interact with each other. Further configuration decisions at the compiler and hardware level increase the mapping complexity, making manual tuning practice very difficult and often simply unfeasible. In this paper, we showed how the HyperMapper tool introduced in [40] is effective across different SLAM algorithm implementations and different hardware platform forms. Crucially, the calculation profile of ElasticFusion is very different from KFusion, which confirms the robustness of our approach. Crowdsourced data allowed us to access a variety of devices and simulation settings, such as HW platforms, compiler and operating system versions, and showed consistent and important accelerations on today's mobile platforms. In future work, we aim to add more SLAM input data to scale scenarios, resulting in a larger number of primed scenarios."}, {"heading": "VII.

application, 3D scene understanding, likely to be significant in the mobile space in the near future. The goal of this exploration is to reduce execution time while meeting our quality of result objectives. In previous work, we showed for the first time that it is possible to map this application to power constrained embedded systems, highlighting that decision choices made at the algorithmic designlevel have the most significant impact. As the algorithmic design space is too large to be exhaustively evaluated, we use a previously introduced multi-objective random forest active learning prediction framework dubbed HyperMapper, to find good algorithmic designs. We show that HyperMapper generalizes on a recent cutting edge 3D scene understanding algorithm and on a modern GPU-based computer architecture. HyperMapper is able to beat an expert human hand-tuning the algorithmic parameters of the class of computer vision applications taken under consideration in this paper automatically. In addition, we use crowd-sourcing using a 3D scene understanding Android app to show that the Pareto front obtained on an embedded system can be used to accelerate the same application on all the 83 smart-phones and tablets with speedups ranging from 2x to over 12x.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
