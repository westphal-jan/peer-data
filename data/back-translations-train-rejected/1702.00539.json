As the importance of PCG for game development increases, researchers explore new avenues for generating high-quality content with or without human involvement; this paper addresses the relatively new paradigm of using machine learning (in contrast with search-based, solver-based, and constructive methods). We focus on what is most often considered functional game content such as platformer levels, game maps, interactive fiction stories, and cards in collectible card games, as opposed to cosmetic content such as sprites and sound effects. In addition to using PCG for autonomous generation, co-creativity, mixed-initiative design, and compression, PCGML is suited for repair, critique, and content analysis because of its focus on modeling existing content. We discuss various data sources and representations that affect the resulting generated content. Multiple PCGML methods are covered, including neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, autoencoders, and deep convolutional networks; Markov models, $n$-grams, and multi-dimensional Markov chains; clustering; and matrix factorization. Finally, we discuss open problems in the application of PCGML, including learning from small datasets, lack of training data, multi-layered learning, style-transfer, parameter tuning, and PCG as a game mechanic.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 04:49:22 GMT  (1406kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00539v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Aug 2017 11:50:28 GMT  (1785kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00539v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["adam summerville", "sam snodgrass", "matthew guzdial", "christoffer holmg{\\aa}rd", "amy k hoover", "aaron isaksen", "y nealen", "julian togelius"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.00539"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.00539.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML)", "authors": ["Adam Summerville", "Sam Snodgrass", "Matthew Guzdial", "Christoffer Holmg\u00e5rd", "Amy K.

OPEN PROBLEMS AND OUTLOOK", "text": "In this section, we describe some of the most important issues facing PCGML and open areas for active research. As games as an ML research area are very different from other ML areas, such as vision and audio learning, the problems that arise from them vary accordingly. In particular, game data sets tend to be much smaller than data sets in other areas, they are dynamic systems based on interaction, and the availability of high-quality clean data is limited. In the following sections, we discuss the problem of limited data, as well as insufficiently researched applications of PCGML for games including style transfer, parameter tuning and potential PCGML game mechanics. Learning from small data sets is a general principle that games are likely to always be data-limited."}, {"heading": "B.
