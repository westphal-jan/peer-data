Based on the assumption that event-related information can be recovered from different documents written in different languages, we extend the Cross-document Event Ordering task presented at SemEval 2015 by specifying two new tasks for, respectively, Multilingual and Cross-lingual Timeline Extraction. We then develop three deterministic algorithms for timeline extraction based on two main ideas. First, we address implicit temporal relations at document level since explicit time-anchors are too scarce to build a wide coverage timeline extraction system. Second, we leverage several multilingual resources to obtain a single, inter-operable, semantic representation of events across documents and across languages. The result is a highly competitive system that strongly outperforms the current state-of-the-art. Nonetheless, further analysis of the results reveals that linking the event mentions with their target entities and time-anchors remains a difficult challenge.

The term of the event is based on the TimeML definition, namely, an event is considered to describe a situation or condition or circumstance that can be considered true (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b).In fact, the timeline extraction task is again quite close to the temple campaigns (Verhagen et al., 2007; Uzaman et al al., 2013).In short, the problem is formulated as a classification task to decide the type of temporal association that combines two different events or a temporal expression."}, {"heading": "3 Multilingual and Cross-lingual Timeline Extraction", "text": "The definition of the Timeline Extraction was formulated as follows: \"In view of a set of documents and a target unit, the task is to create an event timeline related to that unit, i.e. to identify in time, anchor, and arrange the events affecting the target unit.\" (Minard et al., 2015) As we mentioned in the previous section, in this work we will focus on Track A (Main Track), which is the most sophisticated and realistic setting of the two: systems will receive a set of raw text documents and the task is to extract the timelines. In addition, we will contribute two novel extensions to the original task: \u2022 Multilingual Timeline Extraction: This task easily extends the SemEval task 2015 to cover new languages. Thus, a parallel set of documents and a set of target units common to all languages will be provided. The goal is to obtain a Timeline Timeline Extraction for each set of target languages by: \u2022 For each set of languages, a parallel timelines extraction in each language unit is a parallel timelapse."}, {"heading": "4 Data Annotation", "text": "In the original timeline extraction task at SemEval 2015 (Minard et al., 2015), the data set was extracted from the raw text of the English side of the MeanTime corpus (Minard et al., 2016).

Wikinews articles mostly focus on four main topics, 30 documents per topic. A split of 30 documents and 6 target units (each connected to a timeline) is provided as test data, while the rest is left as a rating set: 90 documents and 38 target units (each associated with a timeline). Likewise, the Spanish dataset contains 120 articles with 44 units. However, the process and test splits for this language are the same as for the English dataset. On the other hand, since the lingual dataset is created by joining the English and Spanish datasets, it contains 240 articles containing the same 44 target units as in the English and Spanish datasets. In this case, the test split includes 60 documents and 6 target units, while the test set contains the remaining 180 documents and 38 target units."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation Methodology", "text": "The evaluation method proposed in SemEval 2015 is based on the evaluation metric used for TempEval3 (UzZaman et al., 2013).The metric aims to capture the temporal awareness of a note by reviewing the identification and categorization of temporal relationships. To do this, UzZaman et al. (2013) compare the graph formed by the relationships of a system (sysrelation) and the graph of the reference (refrelation).From these graphs, their conclusions (Sys + relationship) and reduced forms (Sys relationship, ref relationship) are generated by the removal of redundant relationships that can be inferred from other relationships. In this setting, precision and recall the recall of these metrics are calculated as follows."}, {"heading": "5.1 Strict evaluation", "text": "In the strict evaluation method, a timeline must include any mention of the events that can be found in the Document Collection. In addition, event mentions that relate to the same event should be identified and distinguished from those that simply occur at the same time. To this end, the following changes are proposed: \u2022 Corresponding events are not linked by the SIMULTANE relationship, but by means of a new IDENTITY relationship. \u2022 The IDENTITY relationships are never removed from the reduced diagrams. They are not redundant. The strict temporal graph shown in Figure 3 shows the graph obtained with our new methodology. While in the original graph in Figure 2, the correlated events en-revelations and es-revelations are linked by a redundant SIMULTANEOUS relationship, Figure 3 establishes a non-redundant IDENTITY relationship, which specifies the additional relationship between these two events, because this method is more demanding in terms of the two."}, {"heading": "5.2 Relaxed evaluation", "text": "A second alternative arises from the consideration that instead of using every mention of an event, a timeline could be composed of event types. Thus, Korean events would be grouped into a single event by eliminating their temporal relationships. In terms of the original SemEval 2015 evaluation, the following changes are then made: \u2022 Any relationship between Korean events is removed. \u2022 All SIMULTANEOUS relationships between Korean events and a TIMEX3 anchor are reduced to a single relationship. These changes are explicitly shown in Figure 4. It is evident that there is no connection between the en-revelations and the es-revelado Korean events. Furthermore, the SIMULTANEOUS relationships linking that event to their TIMEX3 anchor have been reduced to one, namely, they are now linked to the event type (or to any mention of a particular event). In this method, the number of relationships that need to be recorded is smaller because the result of a Korean event is only adequately evaluated in the detection of the event."}, {"heading": "6 Automatic Cross-lingual TimeLine extraction", "text": "This section introduces our approach to multilingual timeline extraction, including multilingual and cross-systems. In view of a set of documents and a target unit, a three-step process is applied. First, the mentions of the target unit are identified. Second, the events in which the target unit is involved are selected. Finally, these events are anchored in their respective normalized time expressions. Once this process is complete, the events are sorted and the timeline is built up. Below, we describe the three different timeline extraction systems that are applied to the tasks described above. Section 6.1 introduces the Base System (BTE). BTE performs timeline extraction by combining the output of an NLP pipeline in both English and Spanish. The base system is then improved in Section 6.2 by applying the algorithm for executing timelines at the document level (DLT) presented in Laparra et al. (2015)."}, {"heading": "6.1 BTE: Baseline TimeLine Extraction", "text": "We use the NewsReader NLP pipelines (Vossen et al., 2016), which include both English and Spanish, Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Disambiguation (NED), Coreference Resolution (CR), Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), Time Expressions Identification (TEI) and Normalization (TEN), and Temporal Relation Extraction (TRE). Table 2 lists the specific tools for English and Spanish.The extraction of target units, events, and time anchors is performed as follows: (1) Target Entity Identification (TEN), and Temporal Relation Extraction (TRE). As a surface form of the candidate entities, we can strongly redirect the entities, and we use the links contained in DBpedia to expand the search for targets."}, {"heading": "6.2 DLT: Document Level Time-anchoring", "text": "In fact, it is in such a way that we shall be able to reconstruct the aforementioned events, namely in the manner in which they are able to reconstruct them, in which they are able to reconstruct them, and in the manner in which they are able to reconstruct them, in which they are able to reconstruct them, in which they are able to reconstruct them, in which they are able to reconstruct them, in which they are able to reconstruct them, in which they are able to reconstruct, in which they are able to reconstruct, reconstruct, reconstruct, reconstruct, reconstruct, reconstruct, reconstruct, reconstruct, reconstruct, reconstruct, reconstruct, to reconstruct, to reconstruct, to reconstruct, to reconstruct, to reconstruct, to reconstruct, to reconstruct, to reconstruct."}, {"heading": "6.3 CLE: Cross-Lingual Event coreference", "text": "As already mentioned, multilingual timeline extraction depends crucially on the ability to identify those events that are relevant across borders (not just in documents). To solve this problem, we propose a language-independent knowledge representation for multilingual semantic interoperability on three different levels of annotation. First, we use networked links in the DBpedia entries to perform multilingual linkages with the Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) identifier. The NED module used in the NLP pipeline for BTE provides links to the English and Spanish versions of DBpedia. Thus, a mention of New York in English should be timed as an external reference to the Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) designation."}, {"heading": "7 Experimental Results", "text": "In this section, we present a series of experiments to evaluate the three timeline extraction systems presented in the previous section: (i) the BTE base system based on analysis through a pipeline of NLP tools; (ii) the DLT algorithm aimed at capturing implicit document-level timelapse; and (iii) the CLE system to address the lingual event reference; evaluations will be performed for both the original English SemEval 2015 task and the multilingual and cross-lingual timeline extraction tasks proposed in Section 3; each result will be evaluated using the original SemEval 2015 metric and the strict and relaxed metrics introduced in Section 5."}, {"heading": "7.1 Multilingual evaluation", "text": "In this context, we evaluate both the BTE systems and the DLT systems on track A (main track) of the TimeLine extraction task at SemEval 2015 and on the multilingual task described in Section 3. Track A at SemEval 2015. Track A had only two participant teams, namely WHUNLP and SPINOZAVU, who submitted a total of three runs. Their results in terms of precision (P), recall (R) and F1 are presented in Table 3. We also present in italics additional results of both systems obtained after the official evaluation task (Caselli et al., 2015). The best execution was achieved by the corrected version of WHUNLP 1 with a value of 7.85%. The low numbers obtained show the difficulty of the task. Table 3 also includes the results achieved by our systems.

Now, although they are state-of-the-art tools based on standard evaluation data, they still produce cascading errors, especially when applied to data outside the domain (see Table 8 in Vossen et al. (2016). The aim of this section is to identify the main source of the errors. In a first experiment, we are investigating the ability of our system to extract these events, regardless of the chronological order. The first two rows in Table 6 show that the DLT system is capable of extracting many more events than the BTE baseline system, but in both cases the percentage of events recorded is still low. To investigate the causes of these numbers, we have repeatedly performed the same experiment with partial combinations of the NLP modules."}, {"heading": "9 Concluding Remarks", "text": "In this paper, we present a system for multilingual and multilingual timeline extraction (or cross-document event order), presenting a number of novel contributions: firstly, the original cross-document event order task defined for SemEval 2015 has been expanded to include two new tasks for two languages (English and Spanish) for multilingual and lingual timeline extraction; the annotated datasets for study and evaluation are publicly available; secondly, two new evaluation metrics improve the evaluation methodology of the SemEval 2015 task in two respects: (i) a new strict metric allows for the evaluation of timelines that contain correlated event mentions in both documents and languages; and (ii) a relaxed evaluation metric in which event types (instead of mentions) are evaluated in terms of the importance of memory in timeline evaluation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the European projects QTLeap (EC-FP7-610516) and NewsReader (EC-FP7-316404) as well as by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN), SKATER (TIN2012-38584-C06-01) and TUNER (TIN2015-65308-C5-1-R)."}], "references": [{"title": "IXA pipeline: Efficient and Ready to Use Multilingual NLP tools", "author": ["R.

We then develop three deterministic algorithms for timeline extraction based on two main ideas. First, we address implicit temporal relations at document level since explicit time-anchors are too scarce to build a wide coverage timeline extraction system. Second, we leverage several multilingual resources to obtain a single, interoperable, semantic representation of events across documents and across languages. The result is a highly competitive system that strongly outperforms the current state-of-the-art. Nonetheless, further analysis of the results reveals that linking the event mentions with their target entities and time-anchors remains a difficult challenge. The systems, resources and scorers are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the reproducibility of results.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
