INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that there can only be one such event, that it comes to such an event."}, {"heading": "2. FEATURES & INTERFACE", "text": "MultiWiki provides users with an overview of how the relationship between two articles describing the same topic in different languages changes over time. To this extent, MultiWiki automatically generates a timeline that visualizes the evolution of the semantic similarity of articles over time and the corresponding number of edits for both articles. To visualize this timeline and allow a finer-grained analysis of a pair of articles at a given time, we calculate a semantic similarity scale Sim (A1, A2) for two article snapshots A1 and A2 from different Wikipedia language editions. This score is composed of several similarity functions Simf (A1, A2) applied to different features f-F. We distinguish between text-based features (Ftext) and features using meta information such as images and links (Fmeta)."}, {"heading": "Images", "text": "When comparing two Wikipedia articles, one of the most important visual impressions is conveyed by the images placed in them. Therefore, we calculate the fraction of the images used in both articles. In the user interface, we contrast them in a table like the one in Figure 2 (a)."}, {"heading": "External Links", "text": "Motivated by the results in [4], MultiWiki arranges external links mentioned in the footnotes of the articles and their hosts. As shown in Figure 2 (b), the host names of the external links are displayed to the user based on their frequency of overlaps. The above links are frequently mentioned in both articles and are therefore good indicators of the thematic overlap of the articles."}, {"heading": "Wikipedia Links and Annotations", "text": "Two articles are similar when they relate to the same entities, concepts and topics [3]. To extract this type of annotation, we rely on two sources: (1) Wikipedia links, which are added manually to articles by Wikipedia editors; and (2) Wikipedia links, which are automatically created by the use of an entity annotation tool (DBpedia Spotlight). Although the custom links are precise but rather sparse and without repetition, the automatic annotation reminds the Wikipedia references. These references are cross-lingual through the interlingual article links provided by Wikipedia."}, {"heading": "Wikipedia Editors", "text": "Some multilingual editors tend to edit articles describing the same entity in different languages in such a way that similar content spans all languages [4]. MultiWiki calculates the overlap of editors who contributed to the articles in comparison. In addition, the linguistic standpoint (as defined in [3]) emphasizes cultural differences between language communities. Therefore, we determine the countries from which anonymous editors come and calculate the similarity of country distribution per article. Since this site similarity should measure the similarity of distribution to Simloc, but not be distorted by differences in the number of anonymous editors, it is calculated by Equation 2 (where L assigns the number of sites and each article to Ai a group of editors e-egg): Before calculating the overlap, the number of editors is balanced by multiplying E2 (E1 | E2 | Eloc | Aloc (A2) for the representation of Ec-Ec-1 | Ec-2)."}, {"heading": "Textual Overlap", "text": "MultiWiki provides a fine-grained comparison of article texts by aligning semantically similar text passages in a pair of articles, as shown in Figure 4. This alignment is facilitated by a bottom-up approach: First, sentences with overlapping information are aligned based on the following features: (1) Cosinal similarity of vectors representing text passages with terms (automatically translated into English); (2) similarity of Wikipedia units measured in the sentences; (3) time similarity with temporal expressions automatically extracted from the sentences. Consequently, sentence pairs whose similarity value exceeds a given threshold are merged in bottom-up manners: As long as the similarity of an aligned text passage pair increases, the text passage is extended by adding adjacent sentences from one of the articles or by merging two text passage pairs in close proximity. In view of aligned text passages, they are presented to the user by presenting both articles as directly superimposed by this lateral approach and in opposite formation."}, {"heading": "Textual Similarity", "text": "With regard to the text similarity value of an article pair Simtext (A1, A2), three measurements are derived from the article texts: 1) Text passenger coverage is the percentage of text aligned as part of text passenger pairs; 2) Text length similarity compares the length of articles; and 3) Text overlap similarity is the Jaccard similarity of English (machine-transformed) texts."}, {"heading": "3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & PIPELINE", "text": "In order to facilitate the comparison of articles based on the proposed characteristics and to analyze their temporal evolution, each article pair passes through a pre-processing pipeline. As a first step, we must review the revision history in both languages to create a set of article overview pairs that meets the following condition: both snapshots in an article pair must have been online at the same time. This ensures that the differences between articles are not based on time shifts. In addition, the selected article pairs should be evenly distributed over time to provide a better overview. For each article overview, we collect meta information, extract the sentences and comment them with the characteristics reflected in Section 2 using state-of-the-art methods. The extraction and commentary pipeline is shown in Figure 3. First, we collect the texts of each article and collect their contributing editors from the revision history. For each of the unregistered, anonymous editors, the text address provided for the passage in the country is provided."}, {"heading": "4. DATASET", "text": "To facilitate the demonstration of our methods, we extracted a series of 79 randomly selected pairs of articles to be examined using MultiWiki. For each pair of articles, we collected an average of eight pairs of snapshots. The majority of 54 pairs of articles are German / English, 14 are Dutch / English and the remaining 11 pairs are Portuguese / English. Since we extract several snapshots from each article to construct the timelines, a total of 637 pairs of snapshots were extracted and commented on, including the politician \"Lawrence Eagleburger,\" the German film \"Der Stern von Afrika\" and the \"Allgemeine Post.\""}, {"heading": "5. RELATED WORK", "text": "One area of interest in this context is the study of linguistic differences in Wikipedia. [3] In [4] Rogers conducts an intensive case study comparing the highly controversial articles on the Srebrenica massacre in multiple Wikipedia language editions. In his thesis, all studies such as image alignment and table of contents are carried out manually. To simplify such tasks in the future, some of the features mentioned in [4] have been implemented in MultiWikipedia. Two of the few existing tools to support linguistic analysis in Wikipedia are Manypedia [3], which provides automatic translation into English, article statistics and overlapping Wikipedia links, and Omnipedia [1], which can be used to compare the given Wikipedia links for up to 25 language editions simultaneously."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this article, we introduced MultiWiki - a novel user interface for performing a detailed visual analysis of the similarities and differences between Wikipedia articles on the same subject written in different languages. MultiWiki provides the opportunity to explore how information is disseminated in the language editions by observing how the similarity of a pair of articles develops over time. In addition, it allows a detailed visual comparison of article snapshots based on users, media elements, entities and links, as well as a detailed analysis of textual similarities."}, {"heading": "7.
