In this work, much of the focus is on the way arguments are constructed from some components, expressed in some logic.

Aspic \"begins with a logical language L with a concept of negation. A given argumentation is then equipped with rules of argumentation, and aspic\" distinguishes two types of rules of argumentation: strict rules and defective rules. Strict rules invoked with the help of arguments are rules whose conclusions apply without exception. Defective rules that are denounced are rules whose conclusions apply unless there is an exception. The language and set of rules are used to define an argumentation system: Definition 1 (argumentation system) An argumentation system is a tuple AS \"xL,\" R, ny where: \u2022 L is a logical language."}, {"heading": "3 Minimality", "text": "This does not mean that the arguments in the conclusion of this argument are not in some sense minimal, as we will now show; the following example illustrates the fact that any element (sentence or rule) in the reasoning and rule of an argument need not be used to be used in the conclusion of that argument: Example 2 Given the reasoning theory of Example 1, the structural C \"ptp, q, t, uu, tp, q, r, u, u, u, r, u, r, r, the reasoning of the argument. In particular, C is not an argument because the third clause of Definition 4 justifies only the addition of the rules and reasons of an argument for each premise of the rule that is the subject of the clause."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this report, we have examined the notion of the minimality of arguments in the context of aspiration. \"We have considered two forms of minimality: the first corresponds to the native minimality of aspiration,\" which implies that arguments do not contain irrelevant reasons or rules. We have found that under the native form of minimality redundant and circular arguments can be gained. Although there is nothing wrong with circular and redundant arguments per se, in some cases it can be helpful to work with arguments that satisfy a stronger form of minimality. A stronger form of minimality is satisfied by what we have identified as regular arguments, as these are the arguments most commonly encountered in argumentation literature. Specifically, regular arguments use a minimal set of arguments and rules to derive their conclusion."}], "references": [{"title": "A reasoning model based on the production of acceptable arguments", "author": ["L.
