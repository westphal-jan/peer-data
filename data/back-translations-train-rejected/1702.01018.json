The \\emph{Implicative Interdependency Model} that utilizes Boolean Logic to capture complex interdependencies was recently proposed which overcome the limitations of the existing models. A number of problems were studies based on this model. In this paper we study the \\textit{Robustness} problem in Interdependent Power and Communication Network.

We utilized the \\emph{Implicative Interdependency Model} model to capture the complex interdependency between the two networks. The model classifies the interdependency relations into four cases. Computational complexity of the problem is analyzed for each of these cases. A polynomial time algorithm is designed for the first case that outputs the optimal solution. All the other cases are proved to be NP-complete. An in-approximability bound is provided for the third case. For the general case we formulate an Integer Linear Program to get the optimal solution and a polynomial time heuristic.

On the other hand, the primary function of a SCADA system is to control energy generation units remotely (terrorist attack). On the other hand, let's consider a series of entities in a network that initially fail, further failures can be triggered by the interdependencies between them. To analyze these infrastructures, it is imperative to model their interdependencies. A number of such models have been proposed [4], [7], [10], [3], [4], [4], [5], [6]."}, {"heading": "2 The Implicative Interdependency Model", "text": "In this section we describe the IIM model [13].

We refer to the dependence equation of each company as an implicit dependency relationship (IDR). In this example, an IDR a1 \u2190 b3 + b1b4 implies that unit a1 is operative if unit b3 or unit b1 and b4 are operative. In the IDR, each conjunction term is e.g. a2a3 as minutes.

An IDN I (A, B, F (A, B)) is robust if a minimum of K + 1 units must fail first with a final failure of at least B (A | | B |) units. For example, the IDN described in Table 1 is robust for any value of B (0, 1). This is because an initial failure of the unit a2 causes all units to fail in the stationary state. The output of the RIDN problem is the parameter K for a certain IDN and a value of E. We explain the decision version of the RIDN problem formally as follows: \"The robustness in the interdependent network (RIDN) problem is the starting point for a specific IDN problem and a value of E, A, A, he, he, he, he (he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he)."}, {"heading": "4 Computational Complexity Analysis", "text": "The IDRs in the IIM model can be represented in four different shapes (1) any size minterm, 2) any size minterm, 3) any number of any size minterms, and 4) any number of any size minterms (general case).

We provide a polynomial time algorithm (algorithm 1) and prove its optimality (theorem 1), which solves the RIDN problem for case I. To develop the algorithm, we use the term kill-set of a unit xi-A-B as in [13]. Kill Set Cxi of a unit xi are the units that failed alone due to the initial failure of xi.

Robustness in an IDN is defined with respect to two parameters K and \u03c1. The Implicative Interdependency Model is used to model the interdependence. The IIM model separates the interdependence relationships into four different cases. Analysis of the computational complexity of the robustness problem is performed with respect to these four cases. For the general form of the interdependence relationship, the problem is considered to be NP-complete. The optimal solution for the general case is determined from an ILP. Heuristics are designed to provide an overestimated K-parameter value for a given B. Finally, we compare the effectiveness of heuristics with the optimal solution using real data sets from Maricopa County, Arizona. Heuristics produced an optimal or near-optimal solution for a given B < 0.42."}], "references": [{"title": "A survey of interdependency models for critical infrastructure networks", "author": ["J.

The Implicative Interdependency Model that utilizes Boolean Logic to capture complex interdependencies was recently proposed which overcome the limitations of the existing models. A number of problems were studies based on this model. In this paper we study the Robustness problem in Interdependent Power and Communication Network. The robustness is defined with respect to two parameters K \u2208 I \u222a {0} and \u03c1 \u2208 (0, 1]. We utilized the Implicative Interdependency Model model to capture the complex interdependency between the two networks. The model classifies the interdependency relations into four cases. Computational complexity of the problem is analyzed for each of these cases. A polynomial time algorithm is designed for the first case that outputs the optimal solution. All the other cases are proved to be NP-complete. An in-approximability bound is provided for the third case. For the general case we formulate an Integer Linear Program to get the optimal solution and a polynomial time heuristic.
