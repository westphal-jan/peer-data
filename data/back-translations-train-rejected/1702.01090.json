Our test domain is the history and philosophy of scientific work on animal mind and cognition. We demonstrate an application of our methods to the problem of identifying and extracting arguments about anthropomorphism during a critical period in the development of comparative psychology. We show how a combination of classification systems and mixed-membership models trained over large digital libraries can inform resource discovery in this domain, using methods that can be generalized to other interdisciplinary research questions. Through a novel approach of drill-down topic modeling, we are able to reduce a collection of 1,315 fulltext volumes to 6 focal volumes that did not appear in the first ten search results in the HathiTrust digital library. This ultimately supports a system for semi-automatic identification of argument structures to augment the kind of \"close reading\" that leads to novel interpretations at the heart of scholarly work in the humanities, drilling down from massive quantities of text to very specific passages. This multi-level view advances understanding of the intellectual and societal contexts in which writings are interpreted.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Feb 2017 17:36:19 GMT  (476kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01090v1", "23 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 00:22:59 GMT  (1053kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01090v2", "revised, 29 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["jaimie murdock", "colin allen", "katy b\\\"orner", "robert light", "simon mcalister", "andrew ravenscroft", "robert rose", "doori rose", "jun otsuka", "david bourget", "john lawrence", "chris reed"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.01090"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.01090.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Multi-level computational methods for interdisciplinary research in the HathiTrust Digital Library", "authors": ["Jaimie Murdock", "Colin Allen", "Katy B\u00f6rner", "Robert Light", "Simon McAlister", "Robert Rose", "Doori Rose", "Jun Otsuka", "David Bourget", "John Lawrence", "Andrew Ravenscroft", "Chris Reed"], "emails": ["colallen@indiana.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 2nd"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "This year, the situation has reached such a stage only once, in which the question is to what extent it is a country in which it is a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a"}, {"heading": "Materials", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "HathiTrust Digital Library", "text": "The HathiTrust Digital Library is a collaboration between over ninety institutions to provide shared access and copyright management to books digitized through a combination of Google, Internet Archives, and local initiatives.

Using the methods described in this paper, we have progressively narrowed the 300,000 volumes down to a subset of 1,315 volumes selected for full-band modeling, then 86 volumes for side-level modeling, and then 6 specific volumes selected for manual analysis of arguments."}, {"heading": "Methods and Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Keyword Search: From Library to Reading List", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "We started with a keyword search in the HathiTrust collection using the HathiTrust Solr index. We searched for terms that aimed to reduce the hundreds of thousands of public works to a series of potentially relevant texts that could be efficiently modeled with the available computer resources. In particular, we searched for \"Darwin,\" \"comparative psychology,\" \"anthropomorphism\" and \"thrift.\" Although the specificity of our query can be considered too restrictive, we emphasize that we follow an exploratory research paradigm - we do not limit ourselves to one particular fact, but examine the available literature at the interface of our interest in the history and philosophy of the mind and cognition of animals."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The search yielded a set of 1,315 books published between 1800 and 1962. We refer to this set of results as HT1315.3 The same query conducted in August 2015 yielded 3,027 full-text results. Remarkably, it would take Charles Darwin 23 years to read a number of books comparable in size to HT1315, as documented in his Reading Notebooks [43]. Even at the unlikely rate of one book a day, it would take almost four years to read these books in their entirety. About one-fifth of the volumes retrieved were course catalogs, but even eliminating them would leave a daunting, if not Olympic, reading task. As the majority of the volumes selected by keyword search were not directly relevant to the research project, the potential benefit enabled by a more complex computerized analysis of the full texts is crucial for gathering information."}, {"heading": "Probabilistic Topic Modeling of Volumes: Narrowing the Reading", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Lists", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Probabilistic topic models [44] are a family of mixed member models that describe documents as a distribution of topics, with each topic itself being a distribution over all the words in a corpus. Theme models are generative models that we interpret to provide a theory of context mixing during the writing process [43]. To construct the topic models used in this study, we use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA - [45]) with priorities estimated using the Gibbs sample [46] as implemented in the InPhO Topic Explorer [47]. First, we modelled the HTRC1315 set with four different values for the number of topics, k = {20, 40, 60, 80}. We applied cosine similarity measures to the topic mixtures attributed to each volume by the model."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The manual inspection of the topics generated for the different values of k showed that while all four models produced interpretable results, we felt that k = 60 represented the best balance between specificity and generality for our HPS objectives. Table 1 shows the ten most important topics related to the word \"anthropomorphism\" in the k = 60Topic model. Verifying this list shows that \"anthropomorphism\" refers to a theological topic (38), a biological topic (16), a philosophical topic (51), an anthropological topic (58), and so on. The topic-checking problem [44] - i.e. how to assess the quality of the topics of the model - remains an important open problem in topic modeling. Nevertheless, most topics in the model can be summarized quickly, with the second topic (16) being the most obvious attraction for researchers interested in comparative psychology."}, {"heading": "Drill-down Topic Modeling: From Books to Pages", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "We have remodelled the HT86 sentence at the level of individual pages and moved closer to our goal of identifying arguments in the text by \"zooming in\" to select books that had a high number of seemingly relevant pages. These reduced pages become suitable targets for manual reasoning by the human reader. The notion of a \"document\" in LDA topic modeling is flexible; you can consider an entire volume as a single document with a specific topic distribution, but you can also create finer-grained models in which each page, paragraph or sentence gets its own topic distribution. As OCR document scans in HathiTrust have very little structural information - there is no coding for section headings or paragraph breaks, let alone chapter breaks - page level was the next level below the full volume we could reliably recover."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "To allow a direct comparison to the results mentioned above with the HT1315 model, we examined the k = 60-page model of intelligence with \"anthropomorphism\" as the query term. Results are presented in Table 4. Note that the subject numbers do not correlate with the Canadian HT86 and HT1315 models. Although a theological topic (18) tops the list, it is clear that biological and psychological topics are becoming more common. Even within topic 18, \"evolution\" and \"science\" are among the ten words most likely to indicate that the topic is a \"religion and science\" topic than the more general religious topic 38 from the HT1315 model (Table 1) and reflect the narrower range of books in the HT86 subset.Using \"anthropomorphism\" and \"psychology\" in combination with psychology \"as the query, topic 1 is the highest ranking topic in Table 5."}, {"heading": "Argument Extraction: From Pages to Arguments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "From the HT6 collection, we selected 108 pages for further analysis (Table 7), which were commented on with the ontology of the argument Interchange Format (AIF - [48]), which defines a vocabulary for describing arguments and argument networks. We created 43 argumentation cards using AIF-annotated documents that provide a visual representation of the structure of each argument (e.g. Figure 1). The argument content was labeled with OVA + 4, an application that links text blocks using argument nodes. OVA + provides a drag-and-drop interface for analyzing textual arguments. It also handles natively AIF structures. Each argument was subdivided into theses, as selected in the previous section, and marked as a series of text blocks. 4http: / / ova.arg-tech.org /, see also [49] These text blocks containing theses were associated with theses that support them or cut off an argument map."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "We conducted two types of argumentation analysis: Pass 1 aimed to summarize the arguments presented in each volume; Pass A aimed to sequence the arguments presented in each volume; all argumentation maps can be found at http: / / bit.ly / 1bwJwF9. A full description of the study, including the analysis of the arguments, can be found in [50].As a conceptual proof, these arguments demonstrate the usefulness of new techniques for multi-faceted search that allow access from a library of over 300,000 books to the volume analysis of a subset of 1,315 books to page-based analysis of 108 pages for the purpose of identifying, coding, modelling and visualizing arguments. These argument diagrams function as a kind of close reading common in the humanities, drawing on a rich tradition of philosophical literature (reviewed in [51])."}, {"heading": "Drilling Down Again: From Arguments to Sentences", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "To further explore the benefits of combining distance reading with close reading, we applied subject modeling to the relatively small text units that comprise the sentences within a single volume. We chose Washington's textbook The Animal Mind for its historical significance and modeled its 17,544 sentences as a collection of documents. To explore the power of subject modeling to identify latent but significant relationships at the micro-level, we randomly chose a sentence from argument 15 in the Washburn set and used it to query The Animal Mind's sentence model for the most similar sentences using the cosine of sentence topic vectors."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want."}, {"heading": "Zooming Out Again: Macroanalysis by Science Mapping", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "We created a visualization of the retrieved books superimposed on a map of the sciences [33] to understand the distribution of the retrieved books in relation to scientific disciplines. New data sets are superimposed on this map by matching journal names or keywords with the 554 subdisciplines. However, this paper is the first instance in which book data is used on a scientific map. We constructed a classification cross section to align journal-based subdisciplines with a book classification system. Library of Congress Classification Outline (LCCO) provides a disciplinary taxonomy similar to the UCSD Map of Science. By using the Library of Congress Control Numbers (LCCN) assigned to each of the 25,258 journal sources in the UCSD Map of Science, we were able to assign the probabilities of each LCCN belonging to each discipline."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Using the LCCO Crosswalk classification, we have found 776 out of 1,315 books on the UCSD Map of Science, as shown in Figure 2.In general, the map confirms that the initial keyword-based selection from the books accessed by HathiTrust, located topically below the \"equator\" of the map, was expected to have particular concentrations in the life sciences and humanities. The map provides additional visual confirmation that the further selections through Topic Modeling could target a subset of 86 and then six of the original collection of 1,315 books in appropriate areas of interest. In the interactive online version, nodes can be selected to show which volumes are mapped and provide the titles and links to various external metadata sources. Ultimately, the blending of the map provides a broad overview and potential guide to specific books that have been modeled thematically, although the map does not fully meet the desired goal of a high-ranking overview analysis without further guidance from the subject models."}, {"heading": "General Discussion", "text": "The term \"distant reading\" has captured the imagination of many people in the digital humanities, but the correct interpretation of large-scale quantitative models depends on whether they have a sense of the texts, much like Barbara McClintock's emphasis on a \"sense of the organism\" [52] or Richard Feynman's emphasis on the importance of creating \"a sense\" of the subject \"that goes beyond knowledge of the basic laws.\" [53] The interpretation of data and models, whether in science or in the realm of humanity, is itself the task in which humans play an enormous role, despite some minor successes in areas such as medical diagnostics."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The process and results of our iterative drill-down method are summarized in Figure 3 and show the reduction of the 300,000 public domain volumes in the HathiTrust in August 2012 to the HT1315 collection, to the approximately 32,000 pages in the HT86 collection, to the more than 17,000 sentences in the HT6 collection, to a smaller portion of the 108 pages selected for accurate reading and argumentation labeling. This reduction allowed us to identify key elements of the arguments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries about the anthropomorphization of non-human organisms, and to uncover the surprising taxonomic range of these arguments, even taking into account amoeba consciousness. The alternative approach of simply counting the occurrence of species names in these books would only have pointed to the presence of such discussions, while topic modeling allowed researchers to zero passages worthy of detailed analysis and humanistic interpretation through contextualization."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was funded by the National Endowment for Humanities (NEH) Office of Digital Humanities (ODH) Digging Into Data Challenge (\"Digging by Debating\"; PIs Allen, Bo \ufffd rner, Ravenscroft, McAllister, Reed, and Bourget; Award # HJ-50092-12).The authors thank the Indiana University Cognitive Science Program for continued supplemental research funding, in particular for research fellowships for Jaimie Murdock and Robert Rose.

We demonstrate an application of our methods to the problem of identifying and extracting arguments about anthropomorphism during a critical period in the development of comparative psychology. We show how a combination of classification systems and mixed-membership models trained over large digital libraries can inform resource discovery in this domain, using methods that can be generalized to other interdisciplinary research questions. Through a novel approach of drill-down topic modeling, we are able to reduce a collection of 1,315 fulltext volumes to 6 focal volumes that did not appear in the first ten search results in the HathiTrust digital library. This ultimately supports a system for semi-automatic identification of argument structures to augment the kind of \u201cclose reading\u201d that leads to novel interpretations at the heart of scholarly work in the humanities, drilling down from massive quantities of text to very specific passages.
