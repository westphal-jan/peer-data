Section 3.1. After describing the Wikipedia dataset used, we present statistical results and observations we made during the analysis and the final discussions."}, {"heading": "4.1 Wikipedia Dataset", "text": "The data we used for our analysis came from the English Wikipedia of February 13, 2014. As a starting point, we used list pages that dealt with name changes. Due to the different formats of these lists, we focused on lists of the form in which each unit is represented as a single sphere and the name changes are represented by arrows (\u2192) (see section 2). These lists are easy to analyze and therefore provide a reliable basis in terms of evaluation errors. 19 of these lists were found on Wikipedia. Nine of the lists were identified as completely redundant. After filtering redundant elements, we ended up with 10 lists: geographic renaming, list of name changes of cities, list of name changes of administrative units, and lists dedicated to specific countries.One downside of the format limitation is that we found only lists of geographical units, which is ignored for the moment and discussed later in Section 5.1, where we manually performed a list of name changes for different types of units parasitic and the same analysis."}, {"heading": "4.2 Statistics about Name Changes on Wikipedia List Pages", "text": "Table 1 shows a detailed listing of the collected statistics. The company with the most names in the analysis is Plovdiv, the second largest city in Bulgaria, with 11 changes: Kendros (Kendrisos / Kendrisia) \u2192 Odryssa \u2192 Eumolpia \u2192 Philipopolis \u2192 Trimontium \u2192 Flavia \u2192 Julia \u2192 Paldin / Ploudin \u2192 Poulpoudeva \u2192 Filibe \u2192 PlovdivThe average number of changes per unit is 1.48. Each of the companies that changed its name has an average of 2.39 different names. Unlike Plovdiv, on 708 (36.8%) of the units we have extracted, at least one name change has been noted with a date. In total, 933 of the total 2,852 units are listed with data (32.7%). Only these were the subject of further analysis, as the ultimate goal is to identify extracts describing a complete name change that we consider to be prior."}, {"heading": "4.3 Statistics about Evolution Mentions in Wikipedia Articles", "text": "Based on 1,898 entities with articles, we analyzed 2,782 referenced articles. For entities resolved to multiple articles, all articles were taken into account in this analysis. To take into account a name change reported in an article, we reviewed all three components of a change to be mentioned (i.e., previous and subsequent names and the date of change), including 572 of the 918 name changes with a date available from the entities (62.3%). By taking into account only articles resolved for the most recent name, 551 (60.0%) complete changes are mentioned. As described in Section 3.1, we limited our goal of the analysis to the core question: How many sentences include extracts mentioning a full name change? To answer these, we measured the sentence spacing of the three components for each of the 572 name changes described in Section 3.2. Overall, the average sentence spacing of the extracted passages is 19.9 and a very high distance of 80.3."}, {"heading": "5 Generalization and Discussions", "text": "At that time, however, the lists analyzed consisted only of geographical units. It was not possible to reliably analyze name changes from different domains on Wikipedia. Unlike the semi-structured lists of geographical units, they are described in an unstructured manner. Therefore, we can only cautiously assume that our observations apply to other units as well. To verify this, we have manually analyzed a list of renamed products and companies and performed the same analysis to generalize the results. In this section, we compare and discuss our results and outline how the results can be used to expand the training set to general units."}, {"heading": "5.1 Towards Generalization", "text": "In addition to automatically analyzing lists of different geographical units, we manually extracted 47 units from the list of renamed products9, which also included company names, for which we performed the same analysis as in Section 3. Details of the data set and statistical results are summarized in Table 2. As before, we proceeded only with units that are resolvable for Wikipedia articles and commented with change data on the listing. 36 units meet these conditions, which is 75%. These consist of 45 (71.4%) name changes out of the total of 63 listed in the analyzed collection. As for geographical units, we searched for the subsequent and previous names and the date of the changes in the corresponding articles. We discovered all three components for 36 changes, which is 80%, which is even more than the 62.3% we found for the geographical units. This result supports our hypothesis that a large number of name changes are mentioned in the Wikipedia article."}, {"heading": "5.2 Discussion", "text": "The idea was to create excerpts9 http: / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / List _ of _ renamed _ productsfrom Wikipedia articles describing name developments in limited length. This knowledge can be used to build an Entity Evolution Knowledge Base to support other applications and serve as a reason for further research in this field. Our hypothesis was that name developments are described in short excerpts with limited length. Based on the statistics, this can be confirmed. Nearly 70% of the 918 name changes available with corresponding articles and data are mentioned in the Wikipedia articles of their entities, out of which 85.3% were found within excerpts of ten judgments or less. Two thirds even had a distance of less than three sentences."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In our study, we examined how name changes are mentioned in Wikipedia articles regardless of structural elements and found that a large portion is covered by short passages of text. We were able to automatically extract the relevant extracts from articles using lists of name changes. Although the name developments mentioned in Wikipedia articles are far from complete, they provide a respectable basis for the discovery of further entity developments. In future work, we will use the extracts we found on Wikipedia to discover patterns and train classifiers to find similar extracts from other sources as well as thoughtless articles on Wikipedia. The first step is a more detailed analysis of the extracted extracts, followed by appropriate technical features. Once we are able to identify the components of a name change in the extracts, we can also include other language versions of Wikipedia."}], "references": [{"title": "DBpedia - a large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from wikipedia", "author": ["Jens Lehmann", "Robert Isele", "Max Jakob", "Anja Jentzsch", "Dimitris Kontokostas", "Pablo N.
