INTRODUCTION", "text": "With the Web as a daily source of updates and news, archiving Web content has become important for preserving knowledge. However, due to the enormous amount of data that has been published at different times, accessing Web archives poses a number of challenges. Historical and evolutionary knowledge is indispensable to understanding archived texts that were created long ago. This is especially important in order to find entities such as several features that have changed over time. Most serious in this regard are name changes, which are typically used as queries. Berberich et al. [1] tackled this problem by proposing a rewording technology to translate terms used in older texts into terms, using on-time permissions to make digital or hard copies of this work for personal or class-specific purposes, provided that copies are not made for profit or commercial advantage, and that copies are carried on these pages and that copies are made in full."}, {"heading": "2. DATASET", "text": "The data we used for our analysis came from the English Wikipedia of February 13, 2014. As a starting point, we used list pages that dealt with name changes. Due to the different formats of these lists, we focused on those that are easy and reliable to analyze. We found 19 lists in a suitable format. Each name change on these lists is presented as follows: \"previous name \u2192 subsequent name (date).\" After filtering redundant elements, we ended up with 10 lists. A disadvantage of the format limitation is that we found only lists of geographical units: geographical renaming, list of changes of city1http: / / www.DBpedia.orgname, list of name changes in administrative departments as well as lists dedicated to specific countries. The parsed lists contain 1,926 different units with 2,852 name changes. For the names found, we obtained 2,782 articles. The greater number of articles compared to units is a result of 766 units with names that could be resolved to other items, which we were unable to resolve in any units."}, {"heading": "3. STATISTICAL RESULTS", "text": "Based on the data set, we gathered statistics on company name development in their respective articles. First, we analyzed lists of company name changes for their completeness and suitability for such analysis. Then, we added articles to analyze the mention of available changes."}, {"heading": "3.1 Lists of Entity Name Changes", "text": "Of the 1,926 entities with 2,852 name changes that we extracted from lists, 1,898 could be resolved into corresponding articles (98.5%). Since the ultimate goal is to identify excerpts that describe a complete name change (i.e., consisting of the previous name, subsequent name, and modification date), only those were the subject of further analysis (e.g..... \u2192 previous \u2192 subsequent (date) \u2192...). Of the remaining 2,810 changes, this applies to 918, which is 32.2% of the originally extracted changes. These relevant changes belong to 696 entities, which is 36.1% of all entities we started with. They are the subject of our research into excerpts describing name developments."}, {"heading": "3.2 Mentions in Wikipedia Articles", "text": "Based on the companies that meet the requirements, we analyzed the relevant articles for name changes mentioned in the text. For companies that were resolved to multiple articles, all articles were taken into account. Of the available 918 date-annotated name changes by companies with articles, we found 572 (62.3%) with all three components (previous name, subsequent name, and date of modification) named names, which were used to take a closer look at the excerpts of texts that report changes. We measured the sentence spacing of the three components for each of the 572 name changes. This is the minimum spacing from one sentence mentioning one of the components to the next sentence mentioning the last component while bypassing the remaining one. For example, if a sentence contains all components, the sentence spacing for that change is 0. Overall, the average sentence spacing of the extracted extracts was 19.9, but this is caused by very few very large distances and is not representative, as the median of 1 excerpts of a total of 1, resulting in 488% less than 572% of excerpts."}, {"heading": "4. DISCUSSION", "text": "The hypothesis was that name developments are described in short excerpts within texts that can later be used to learn common patterns for the automatic discovery of evolutions, and based on our observations this can be confirmed. Over 60% of the 918 name changes that were available with corresponding articles and data are mentioned in Wikipedia articles, of which more than two thirds were found within excerpts of less than three sentences. Extracting certain patterns to form classifiers for the purpose of identifying evolutions remains automatic for future work. However, a first look at some excerpts already showed that many of them contain certain signal words, such as \"was,\" \"\" rename, \"\" change. \"Unfortunately, the lists analyzed consist only of geographical units, as we were unable to fully analyze fairly unstructured lists on Wikipedia covering units of different domains. At this point, accuracy was of paramount importance for the later elaboration of classifications, in order to extend them on the basis of precision."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In our study, we examined how name changes in Wikipedia articles are mentioned independently of structural elements and found that a large part is covered by short passages of text. We were able to automatically extract the corresponding extracts from articles based on lists of name changes. Although the name developments mentioned in Wikipedia articles are far from complete, they provide a respectable basis for the discovery of further entity developments. In future work, we will use the extracts we have found on Wikipedia to discover patterns and train classifiers to find similar extracts in other Wikipedia articles and other sources. The first step will be a more detailed analysis of the extracted extracts, followed by the development of appropriate features. Finally, we will build a knowledge base dedicated to entity developments. Such a knowledge base can serve as a source for applications that rely on evolutionary knowledge, such as information retrieval systems, especially on web archives."}], "references": [{"title": "Bridging the terminology gap in web archive search", "author": ["K.
