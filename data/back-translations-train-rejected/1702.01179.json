INTRODUCTION", "text": "This additional knowledge supports users in exploration and information retrieval (IR) tasks. As documents were created in libraries at different times and eras, current and historical knowledge is required, in addition to information about evolution. In particular, changed entity names can drastically affect keyword searches in older texts. IR systems that are aware of current and previous names can actively help users find earlier occurrences of developed entities. However, while 978-1-4799-5569-5 / $31.00 c \u00a9 2014 IEEE.current provides facts about an entity, historical knowledge and evolutionary information are hard to obtain. We demonstrate a system that provides evolutionary descriptions that are automatically extracted from unstructured websites. An important source of knowledge for many applications is linked data."}, {"heading": "2. APPROACH", "text": "The approach that we implemented in our demonstration is based on the analysis results presented in [1]. In this thesis, we introduced the terminology of the sentence distance from a1http: / / www.DBpedia.org 2http: / / www.Freebase.com 3http: / / www.mpi-inf.mpg.de / yago-naga / yagoar Xiv: 170 2.01 179v 1 [cs.C L] 3F eb2 017name evolution within a section. It denotes the distance of the first and last sentences spanned by the components of a name change: previous name, subsequent name and date of change. Since we found more than two thirds of all name changes within a sentence spacing up to 2, we created three training sets for the three sentence lengths and one that consists of all extracts, resulting in four classification models."}, {"heading": "Data", "text": "Each data set consists of the positive examples we extracted from Wikipedia and a random sample of negative examples, that is, the remaining extracts of equal length from the articles under consideration. In addition to the length, we required that all extracts have certain characteristics characteristic of evolutionary extracts, and they must contain at least two names (i.e. preceding and subsequent names) and one year (i.e. the modification date). To ensure that a change encompasses the entire extract and is not contained in a shorter extract within the long, we needed the first and last sentence of a snippet to contain one of the three components. In extracts from distance 0, the first and last sentences are the same. To identify the words of a sentence, we annotated them with a part-of-speech tagger and considered correct nouns as names. Before extracting the characteristics, all names (N) and years (Y) were replaced by special tokens to prepare extracts for generalizing the articles and the classification of the individual articles."}, {"heading": "Classification", "text": "As characteristics, we used all ordered pairs of words in the extracts identified as describing an evolution. Unlike n-grams, especially bigrams, the advantage is that we can recognize patterns such as \"N... renamed N... Y\" (pairs: N-renamed, renamed-N, renamed-Y), even though a name and the term do not appear side by side in our example. The system can work with any classification method simply by swapping the model files. For each sentence spacing, we can specify which classifiers should be used. If more than one classifier is specified, they all need to classify an extract as describing an evolution to show it as a result. This dynamic approach allowed us to try different classifiers and combinations."}, {"heading": "3. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Our Evolution Base Demonstrator shows that extracts describing entity name developments can be identified with promising accuracy. As we only had geographical name development data available for analysis in [1], the classifiers in our demo work best on these as well. However, it also shows that the same patterns can identify name developments of different entity types, for example, people like Muhammad Ali. The system we developed is a first step toward a knowledge base that would cover all types of developments and complement existing linked data sources with evolutionary information. In future work, we plan to study different characteristics and classification methods to further improve the results. Once we have achieved a reliably high level of precision, we will be able to identify further name changes that may lead to new extracts and patterns to expand our training sets. The next step is to identify the components of name development within the extracted snippet and make them available for structuring the results."}], "references": [{"title": "Named entity evolution analysis on wikipedia", "author": ["Helge Holzmann", "Thomas Risse"], "venue": "Submitted to Web Science", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Fast training of support vector machines using sequential minimal optimization.
