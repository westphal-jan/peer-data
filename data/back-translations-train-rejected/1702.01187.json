So, while we operate BlogNEER on a subset of the web (i.e., two blog records in our review), we also have to deal with documents from different areas. From these documents, we select those that were published during a certain period and contain at least part of the entire query period. For example, for the query period, we look at all documents from our data set that include President or Obama during a certain period. However, the term President, for example, is quite ambiguous. There is the President of the United States in which we are interested, but also many other presidents from companies, sports clubs, etc. Therefore, it is not just a term from the political field, and we would probably find many incorrect terms by retrieving all documents from all sources."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Narrowing Change Periods", "text": "With BaseNEER, the concept of change periods was introduced. Change periods are periods in which q q is likely to cover a change in the name of the corresponding entity. An entity may have one or more change periods. In BaseNEER, the year around a break in the query period in the dataset was considered a change period. However, often the documents containing the query period do not occur throughout the year. Actual name changes in such a period could only occur at the end of the year and there could be only one month around the event with documents reporting on it. As an example, we consider the election of President Obama. A dataset consisting of sports blogs might not include President Obama at all at other times. However, since the articles about a sports president report all year, a sub-term match for the president would add a lot of noise to the NEER process. To avoid this scenario, we narrow the periods to a shorter period during the full year in which the documents actually contain the full time periods."}, {"heading": "4.4.1 BaseNEER Modifications", "text": "However, the first three terms are applied iteratively until no further merge is possible. Consequently, the fourth rule is applied for a final merge. Each rule leads to co-reference classes consisting of the combined terms and represented by the most common terms. After each rule, all co-reference classes are merged with the same representative. While the sub-terms rules (rules 2 and 4) are most likely, they find co-references as one of the two combined terms contained in the other terms. The prefix / suffix classes with the same representative are merged."}, {"heading": "4.4.2 Frequency Filtering", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before we get a result like that."}, {"heading": "4.5.1 Resolving Names", "text": "However, the process of assigning a term to its corresponding semantic resource on DBpedia is called name resolution. If a term cannot be found on DBpedia, we insert the direct co-references to resolve the term. Although this does not work in all cases, heuristics gives good results. To resolve a name, we arrange its direct co-references by descending length and increasing frequency. Therefore, we try to resolve longer terms first. If two terms are of the same length, we take the less frequent first. This is intended because longer terms and less frequent terms are more meaningful. Consider, for example, the query Mr. John Doe. The term cannot be resolved because it does not exist on DBpedia. Therefore, we try to resolve its direct co-references John Doe, John Doe and Doe. Probably, John is the most common term because it is a very common name. Therefore, the semantic resource John Doe probably does not represent a Mr."}, {"heading": "4.5.2 Disambiguation and Aggregation of Properties", "text": "This year, it will be ready to leave the country in which it is located."}, {"heading": "4.5.3 Filtering", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to abide by the rules which they have imposed on themselves, and that they are able to abide by the rules which they have imposed on themselves.

An example is Czechoslovakia. Although the country splits into two separate countries, its name evolved from the old to the new names that still describe the same area, even if it is not politically the same country. Thus, from the perspective of NEER, this is a name that makes the development and meaning of a search engine aware. However, on DBpedia, Czechoslovakia, as well as both countries in which it was divided (Czech Republic and Slovakia) have their own resources, without a reference to the other names. For the remaining 21 units, all the co-references that could be found on DBpedia are redirected to the same resource, meaning that the co-references were already known, are not known. The semantic filter does not explicitly use this information, but it implicitly uses them when we compare the corresponding resources in these cases, which we are the same."}, {"heading": "6.2.2 Entities of Same Type", "text": "Another problem we faced was that with the semantic filter, which depends on the similarity of two terms that Gerhard cannot compare with each other as a subcategory, the semantic filter works very reliably on entities of different kinds, for example Pope Benedict and the frequently occurring Vatican. In this case, however, the filter identifies Pope Benedict as a person and the Vatican as a place. Therefore, it filters out the Vatican as a co-reference for Pope Benedict. However, if two terms are of the same kind, filtering is a much more difficult problem. For example, Angela Merkel, the current German chancellor, and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the former German chancellor, are both of the typical person. Since one is the successor of the other, they have at least one year in common, the election when Angela Merkel became the new chancellor. Moreover, both fall into the category of Chancellor of Germany. Therefore, with the proposed semantic filter we are not able to distinguish them."}, {"heading": "6.2.3 Resolving Names and Disambiguation", "text": "In this case, this term does not exist on DBpedia, but on DBpedia, where the terms have different meanings. It is a crucial step for semantic filtering, as the example of Sean Combs in Sect. 5.4 has shown. However, in early experiments we had problems because many terms on the wrong resource were unambiguous. For example, the disamination of Pope Benedict III instead of Pope Benedict XVI leads to wrong results as it is filtered out as a co-reference for Joseph Ratzinger. However, we have made good progress in this area and with the strategies presented in Sect. 4.5.1 and Sect. 4.5.2 we have achieved corrected resolved resources for almost all terms tested. However, as the Sean Combs example shows, the method only works if the intended disaminification entity on DBpedia.To solve a term on its semantic resource, we start with the term itself."}, {"heading": "7 State of the Art", "text": "This year, it will be able to fix and fix the mentioned bugs."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions and Outlook", "text": "eeiD eeisrteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"}], "references": [{"title": "Use and adaptation of written language to the conditions of computer-mediated communication", "author": ["Y.H.
