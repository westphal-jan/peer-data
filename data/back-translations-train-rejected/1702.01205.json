To collect the road information, we combined data from Google Maps and OpenStreetMap [38]. The results provided both lanes and traffic light locations, as shown in Figure 4. In addition to accurate road information, demand for each section of the road must be modeled. We created a needs profile using anonymized location data collected from users using an optional Android mobile phone [39] [40], and the data was collected over several months. Raw data, which itself does not contain personally identifiable information, was additionally scrubbed by segmenting the lanes to prevent an allocation of origin and destinations to further reduce the identification risks.

Detailed Discussion", "text": "Due to the stochastic nature of NASH, as well as the complex interactions that are possible between a system of traffic lights and real traffic, it is difficult to predict which behaviors will arise behind the scenes. It is clear from the previous tables that there has never been any improvement in the situation. In this section, we try to give some intuition as to the way in which they have been achieved. It is surprising that the planning approach was the least successful. Due to the strong physical interpretation of each parameter (physical distances, etc.), it was the only one that advocates an optimization."}, {"heading": "7. Results: Chicago, Illinois", "text": "In Chicago, we looked at twenty traffic lights in the River North area, shown in Figure 1 (below), and the area imported into SUMO is shown in Figure 13. The steps in optimizing the twenty traffic lights in Chicago proceeded in the same way as optimizing the traffic lights in the Mountain View area. To avoid redundancy, we will only provide a summary of the process and results, and refer the reader to Section 6 for details."}, {"heading": "7.1. Calibrating to Real Lights", "text": "In order to establish a realistic baseline, as in Mountain View, we used NASH again to calibrate the lights in our simulations (see Section 4). Similar to the previous experiment, anonymized, completely privacy-friendly travel data was collected from Android users over several months. Approximately 18,000 cars were used in the simulation for our tests. By using NASH to adjust lighting planning, we were able to reduce the average discrepancy between the actual and forecast travel time to about 43 seconds. By comparison, the error was reduced to 51 seconds using the analog method with data from Mountain View, California (see Figure 11)."}, {"heading": "7.2. Testing the New Traffic Light Controllers", "text": "Once the settings for the lights used are estimated, the next step is to try to change the light settings to improve traffic flow. In the first experiment, NASH is used to change the phase duration and equalization of the 20 lights. In the second experiment, NASH is used to optimize the parameters of the micro-auction. In contrast to previous experiments with Mountain View, CA, we will not rethink the planning of the approach to these scenarios. Learning as it progresses, Figure 14 shows that we see several important trends. First, the optimization of the fixed-light controllers (top) does not dramatically improve the performance of the fixed-light controllers in terms of the average time to the target. Compared to the default settings, the best setting has revealed an improvement of about 7%. In contrast, there are much larger variations in the optimization of the auction of the auction controllers."}, {"heading": "8.

Much of the current research in traffic-light optimization relies on extending the capabilities of traffic lights to either communicate with each other or communicate with vehicles. However, before such capabilities become ubiquitous, opportunities exist to improve traffic lights by being more responsive to current traffic situations within the current, already deployed, infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce a traffic light controller that employs bidding within micro-auctions to efficiently incorporate traffic sensor information; no other outside sources of information are assumed. We train and test traffic light controllers on large-scale data collected from opted-in Android cell-phone users over a period of several months in Mountain View, California and the River North neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The learned auction-based controllers surpass (in both the relevant metrics of road-capacity and mean travel time) the currently deployed lights, optimized static-program lights, and longer-term planning approaches, in both cities, measured using real user driving data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
