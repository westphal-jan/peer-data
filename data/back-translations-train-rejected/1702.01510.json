Diagnosing and resolving", "text": "Diagnosis is a process that determines the localization and type of error. There are three classes: analytical model-based method, signal-processing method and knowledge-based method [11]. Table I compares these methods. (Table I) and the solution, the knowledge-based method becomes primary research because of its self-regulation and intelligence. The knowledge-based method is divided into innumerable methods and technologies: fault diagnosis based on the fault tree, fault diagnosis based on the expert system, fault diagnosis based on fuzzy logic, fault diagnosis based on artificial neural networks, fault diagnosis based on grey theory and fault diagnosis based on Bayesian networks. (Figure 2)"}, {"heading": "A. Fault diagnosis based on fault tree (FT)", "text": "FT is a graphical deductive method that refers to the worst error status as a \"top event.\" By searching for all causes, FT identifies the cause that can directly trigger the error as a second level, the cause that can trigger the errors on the second level directly as a third level, and the base cause as \"the bottom event.\" All errors between the top event and the bottom event are referred to as an \"intermediate event.\" FT searches for all possible error models and receives the probability of the worst error. It is a simple tool to diagnose errors, but it is difficult to express the related relationship, and less information content, limited auto-didactic capabilities and updating capability. Exploring the combination of FT with the neural network and expert system will be the future goal [12]."}, {"heading": "B. Fault diagnosis based on Expert system(ES)", "text": "IT is the most notable achievement in error diagnosis in recent years. It solves problems of mimicking behavior when human experts deal with these problems. IT consists of knowledge base, inference engine, database, knowledge acquisition, interpreter, and human-machine interface. (Fig. 3.) The critical and difficult process of IT is knowledge acquisition, knowledge expression, and uncertainty logic [13] [14]. The fusion of ES and Fuzzy Logic, FT, Artificial Neural Network will be the future of this field of research."}, {"heading": "C. Fault diagnosis based on Fuzzy Logic(FL)", "text": "FL was proposed by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965 as a fuzzy set theory and is a form of much-vaunted logic. It deals with arguments that are approximate rather than fixed and accurate. Error diagnosis based on FL depends on the mapping relationship between the symptom space and the error space and justifies the error by the symptom. Due to the immature fuzzy theory, there are no uniform methods for measuring the degree of element belonging in fuzzy set theory and the mapping relationship between two fuzzy sets. Experience and extensive research are usually the most important methods to solve these problems [15] [16]."}, {"heading": "D. Fault diagnosis based on artificial neura lnetwork(ANN)", "text": "Artificial neural network (also called neural network) is a mathematical and computational model that is inspired by the structure and functional aspects of biological neural networks. ANN consists of a networked group of artificial neurons and processes information using a connecting approach for calculation. There are three areas of error diagnosis in which ANN is used: as a classifier of diagnosis from the perspective of pattern recognition; as a dynamic predictive model for diagnosis from the perspective of prediction; as a builder of an expert system based on ANN from the perspective of knowledge processing. ANN's capabilities, such as fault tolerance in principle, topology, robustness, association, adaptability, self-learning, make it an important part of complex system diagnosis, especially the theory of multi-layer perception (MLP) based on the Back Propagation Algorithm (BP), are widespread and successful. Although ANN does not have any advantage in error diagnosis at all."}, {"heading": "E. Fault diagnosis based on Grey theory (GD)", "text": "This method investigates the relationship between information collected from a systemic point of view, i.e. new, unknown diagnostic information from known diagnostic information. It works with the Grey model, prediction, and Grey correlation analysis. Since the Grey theory itself is incomplete, the Grey system's diagnosis is limited to deriving the unknown information from known things. [18]"}, {"heading": "F.
