In short, the proposed hybrid MT process is guided by the rule based MT after getting a set of partial candidate translations provided by EBMT and SMT subsystems. Previous works have shown that EBMT systems are capable of outperforming the phrase-based SMT systems and RBMT approach has the strength of generating structurally and morphologically more accurate results. This hybrid approach increases the fluency, accuracy and grammatical precision which improve the quality of a machine translation system.

Rule Based Machine Translation", "text": "Jordi et al. used rules-based machine translation for machine translation from Chinese to Spanish. [9] In this work, they used the Apertium platform, a toolbox for the shallow transfer of MT. To create translation rules, a bilingual Chinese-Spanish dictionary consisting of almost 9,000 distinctive words is constructed. Grammar translation rules were developed manually, testing this system in various areas with an average accuracy of 82%. Pratik et al. have worked on rules-based machine translation from English to Hindi, but their system is domain-restricted 1TMEM = Translation MEMory [16]. They used dependency parsing as an intermediate representation in the translation. During the translation, the phases of classical analysis, translation and generation strategies are replaced by a syntax planning algorithm that directly syntax the dependency section of the source sentence according to the target language."}, {"heading": "B. Statistical Machine Translation", "text": "A statistical approach based on the English-Hindi machine translation system is being developed, which consists of three processing units, Language Model, Translation Model and Decoder [6]. Language model calculates the probability of a sentence in the target language. Translation model calculates the probability of the target sentence for the given source sentence. The task of the decoder is to select the target sentence that maximizes the probability. The SMT model is trained on the parallel data set of 5000 pairs of sentences. Google translator, a globally recognized and most widely used bilingual translator, is also based on the SMT approach. Google translator learns the SMT parameters from its huge corpus collected from the entire Web. SMT accuracy depends on the body quality and the parameter estimation to be learned. A group from the IBM T.J Watson Reaserch Center is working on the mathematics of SMT and the parameters stimation [17]."}, {"heading": "C. Example Based Machine Translation", "text": "Example-based machine translation systems (EBMT) perform the translation of a given input sentence in three consecutive phases (i) (matching) to verify the presence of the given input in the bilingual corpus (ii) (retrieval) to extract useful segments from the sentence that matches in the bilingual corpus, and (iii) (transfer) to recombine the translated segments [18]. EBMT was based practically on retrieving source sentences that resemble those in the bilingual corpus, hence EBMT is also known as source-like translation. Harold et al. had worked on the example-based machine translation, which focused on various intuitive problems of the EBMT, such as the size of parallel corpus, granularity of examples, quantity of examples, and appropriateness of examples [8]. Manish Manalk suggested using EBMT for English-Fuzzy."}, {"heading": "D. Hybrid Machine Translation", "text": "Paul et al. worked on a hybrid multi-engine approach to MT, using statistical models to generate the best possible results from multiple machine translation systems. He found promising results for machine translation from Japanese to English, using a decision tree method to select the best possible hypothesis from multiple RBMT, EBMT and SMT decoders [20]. Marcu et al. also identified the advantages of a hybrid MT approach, since coupled multiple MT systems take precedence over the separate use of each MT [15]. It is evident that multi-engine MT approaches are capable of surpassing the existing individual MT systems. A comparative study of different existing machine translations with the details of the approaches on which they are based shows Table I. A large number of papers have been carried out in several Indian languages, e.g. Marathi, English, the Hindi FIRE Centre for FIRE Structural Translation Technology and the Hindi FIRE Centre for FIRE FIRE Technology."}, {"heading": "A.
