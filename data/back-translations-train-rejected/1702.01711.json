(Sentiment Analysis often relies on the availability of words and phrases commented on by positive or negative connotations they convey. \"Beautiful,\" \"wonderful\" and \"amazing\" are examples of positive words, while \"bad,\" \"bad\" and \"poor\" are examples of negativity. The creation of lists of sentiment words has generally been carried out using manual or dictatorial methods. and corpus-based methods. Manually, we collect such lists of polarity annotated words islabor intensive and time-consuming, and are therefore usually combined with automated approaches such as final correction."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "There is a large amount of work on sentiment analysis and opinion mining, which is formed by 4841 additional negative 2041 words, and good comprehensive overviews are already available (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012), so we will review most representative and closest to the current work. This means that we will not review the seed-based approaches, but those constructed manually or according to a dictionary or LKB. We will again use the approaches here for comparison with qwn-ppv in Section 4.The most popular manually created polarity lexicon is part of the General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), and consists of 1915 words designated as \"positive\" and 2291 as \"negative.\" Taboada et al. (2010) manually creates its polarity annotating 6232 words on a scale of 5 to -5. Liu et al., starting with Hu and Liu, have formed a polarity along the 41st year of 2004 (the 41st year), the polarity is corrected along the 48th words."}, {"heading": "3 Generating qwn-ppv", "text": "The general approach of our approach consists of two steps: (1) automatically generates a set of seeds by iterating over an LKB relationship (e.g. a WordNet relationship); and (2) uses the seeds to initialize contexts to propagate over the LKB graph using a personalized pagerank algorithm, resulting in qwn-ppv (s): Q-WordNets as Personalized PageRanking Vectors."}, {"heading": "3.1 Seed Generation", "text": "We produce seeds using two different automatic procedures. 1. AG: We start with the quality synthesis of WordNet and iterate via WordNet relationships according to the original Q-WordNet method described in Agerri and Garc\u0131'a Serrano (2010). 2. TL: We take a short manual list of 14 positive and negative words (Turney and Littman, 2003) and iterate via WordNet using five relationships: antonymy, similarity, derived from, Pertains-to and alsosee.The AG method begins with the propagation of attributes of the quality synset in WordNet. There are five substantive quality sensions in WordNet, two of which contain attribute relationships (to adjectives). From quality1n synset, the attribute relationship leads us to positive1a, negative 1a, good 1a and bad1a; quality 2 n leads to the attributes superior 1 and inferia 2a."}, {"heading": "3.2 PPV generation", "text": "The second and last step to the generation of qwn-ppv (s) is the propagation of seeds, which are manifested in the way they have arisen in recent years, in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the world, how they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the way they are manifested in the manifestation of the manifestation of the world, how they are manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifestation of the manifest"}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "Previous approaches provided an intrinsic evaluation (Mohammad et al., 2009; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009; Baccianella et al., 2010) using manually commented resources such as the General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966) as the gold standard. To facilitate comparison, we also offer such a evaluation in Section 4.3. Nevertheless, and as the results of the extrinsic evaluations show, we believe that polarity lexicon should generally be evaluated extrinsically. Finally, each polarity lexicon is as good as the results obtained by using it for a specific sentiment analysis task. Our goal is to evaluate the polarity lexicon, which simplifies the evaluation parameters to avoid as many external influences on the results as possible. We compare our work with most of the lexicons reviewed in Section 2, both at synthesis and word level, the automatic Ginified lexicone (Section I-Qinial), Section 4 (fininified lexicone)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Datasets and Evaluation System", "text": "There are three different corpora: Bespalov et al.'s (2011) and MPQA (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) for English and HOpinion2 for Spanish. In addition, we have divided the corpus into two subsets (75% development and 25% test) for the application of our ratio system for the phrase polarity task. Note that the development sentence is only used to set up the polarity classification task, and that the generation of qwn-ppv lexicons unsupervised.For Spanish we tried to reproduce the English settings with Bespalov's corpus too. \"Thus, both the development and the test sentences from the HOpin-2http: / / clic.ub.edu / corpus / corpus corpus corpus corpus corpus corpus contain a much higher percentage of positive ratings, containing a balanced number of positive and negative reviews to allow for a more meaningful comparison."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results", "text": "Although Tables 1, 2 and 4 also represent the results at the synset level, it should be noted that the only polarity available to us for comparison at the synset level is with respect to the overall results of QWN-PPV-TL, 2010) and SentiWordNet 3.0 (Baccianella et al., 2010). QWNPV-AG refers to the general method presented in this paper, regardless of the seeds identified in this section, and QWN-PPV-TL seeds, as described in Section 3.2. Configuring each qwn-ppv in the results specifies which seed iteration is used as initialization of the personalized PageRank algorithm, and on which graph."}, {"heading": "4.3 Intrinsic evaluation", "text": "For each qwn-ppv lexicon shown in previous extrinsic reviews, we calculate the intersection between lexicon and GI and rate the words at that intersection. Table 7 shows the results for the most powerful QWNPV lexicon (using both AG and TL seeds) in the extrinsic ratings at word level of Tables 1 (first two lines), 2 (lines 3 and 4) and 4 (lines 5 and 6). We can see that QWN-PPV lexicon systematically outperforms SWN in the number of correct entries. QWN-PPV-TL lexicon averages 75.04% of correctness. The most powerful lexicon contains up to 81.07% of correct entries. Note that we have not compared the results with MSOL (ASL-GI) because it contains the GI."}, {"heading": "4.4 Discussion", "text": "In fact, most of us will be able to play by the rules we have set ourselves, \"he said in an interview with the German Press Agency.\" We have to play by the rules, \"he said.\" We have to play by the rules, \"he said.\" We have to play by the rules we have set ourselves. \""}, {"heading": "5 Concluding Remarks", "text": "Although this method is simpler than similar automatic approaches, it still achieves better results based on the four extrinsic ratings presented. As it depends only on the availability of an LKB, we believe that this method can be valuable in generating polarity dictionaries for a particular language on demand if there is insufficient commented data available. We demonstrate the adaptability of our approach by creating good performance polarity dictionaries for different assessment scenarios and for more than one language. Further work includes investigating various graph projections of WordNet relationships for propagation, as well as using synset weights. We also plan to examine the use of commented corpora to generate lexicon at the word level to try to close the gap with those that have been commented (at least in part) manually. The qwn-ppv dictionaries and charts used in this paper are available at qwn-ppv (http: / pplev)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the OpeNER FP7 project under funding number 296451, the FP7 NewsReader project under funding number 316404 and the Spanish MICINN project SKATER under funding number TIN2012-38584-C06-01."}], "references": [{"title": "Personalizing pagerank for word sense disambiguation", "author": ["Agirre", "Soroa2009] Eneko Agirre", "Aitor Soroa"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "citeRegEx": "Agirre et al\\.,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Agirre et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "German Rigau", "author": ["Aitor Gonz\u00e1lez Agirre", "Egoitz Laparra"], "venue": "and Basque Country Donostia.", "citeRegEx": "Agirre et al.2012", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2012}, {"title": "Oier Lopez de Lacalle", "author": ["Eneko Agirre"], "venue": "and Aitor Soroa.", "citeRegEx": "Agirre et al.2014", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2014}, {"title": "and F", "author": ["S.
