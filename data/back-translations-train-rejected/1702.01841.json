We present a case study based on the story cloze task (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016a), where annotators were assigned similar writing tasks with different constraints: (1) writing an entire story, (2) adding a story ending for a given story context, and (3) adding an incoherent ending to a story. We show that a simple linear classifier informed with stylistic features is able to successfully distinguish between the three cases, without even looking at the story context. In addition, our style-based classifier establishes a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze challenge, substantially higher than previous results based on deep learning models.

Our analysis shows several style differences between different groups. First, original endings are on average longer (11 words per sentence) than correct endings (8.75 words), which in turn are slightly longer than false ones (8.47 words). Although writing false sentences is not the same as deception, it is not entirely surprising to observe similar trends in both tasks. Second, Figure 1a shows the distribution of five frequent POS tags across all three groups (Yancheva et al., 2004; Yancheva and Rudzicz, 2013). The figure shows that both original and right endings use pronouns more often than wrong endings."}, {"heading": "4 Model", "text": "To answer this question, we first use simple methods that have proven to be very effective in style recognition (see Section 8). We describe our model below. We train a logistic regression classifier to categorize an ending either as right or wrong or as original or new (correct). Each character vector is calculated on the basis of the words in an ending, without taking into account previous parts of the story. We use the following style characteristics. \u2022 Length: the number of words in the sentence. \u2022 Word grammes: We use sequences of 1-5 words. According to Tsur et al. (2010) and Schwartz et al. (2013b) we distinguish between high and low frequency words. Specifically, we replace substantive words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), which are often low frequency, with their constituents of the language. \u2022 Characters n-grammes: Characters n-gramms are the most useful characteristics in the 2009 style."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "We are designing two experiments to answer our research questions: the first is an attempt to distinguish between right and wrong endings, the second between original endings and new (right) endings; the third is an experiment that compares right and wrong endings; the aim of this experiment is to measure the extent of the differences between right and wrong endings; and the third is a training corpus for the right and wrong ends."}, {"heading": "5.1 Results", "text": "Table 2 shows our results. In all experiments, our model achieves a performance well above what one might expect (50% by intention). Again, our model ignores the context of the story (the previous four sentences) and is therefore unable to grasp any notion of coherence. This result provides strong evidence that the style of the authors was influenced by the written task they had to perform."}, {"heading": "5.2 Story Cloze Task", "text": "The results of Experiment 1 indicate that the right and wrong endings are characterized by different styles. In order to actually assess the quality of our classification results further, we approach the task with our classifier. This classifier is more limited than Experiment 1, since there are two endings and the question is asked what is right and what is wrong. We apply the classifier from Experiment 1 as follows: If it assigns different terms to the two given endings, we keep them. Otherwise, the label whose probability is lower at the back is reversed. Table 3 shows our results on the story we use as a test set. Our classifier gets 72.4% accuracy, only 2.3% lower than the results of art, we keep them.

To answer this question, we repeated experiment 1 with different subsets of characteristics. Table 4 shows our results. Results show that character N-grams are the most effective style predictors achieved within 0.6% of the entire model, but that word N-grams also capture much of the signal and yield 61.2%, which is only 3.3% worse than the overall model. These results are consistent with previous work that used character N-grams along with other types of characteristics to predict writing style (Schwartz et al., 2013b)."}, {"heading": "6.2 Most Salient Features", "text": "In fact, we are looking at the highest absolute positive and negative coefficients in logistic regression effects in 2013. It is worth noting that their reliability is not entirely clear, as they consider most of the features mentioned to be insufficient."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we have shown that different spellings influence a writing style that is easy to recognize. Our findings suggest that authors who are asked to write the last sentence of a five-part story use a different style to find a wrong ending. We have also shown that writing the end as part of a five-sentence story is very different from reading four sentences and writing the fifth sentence. Our findings suggest that the nature of the writing task imposes a different mental state on the author, which can be expressed with extremely simple automatic tools."}, {"heading": "8 Related Work", "text": "Writing style. Writing style has been an active research topic for decades. The models used to characterize style are often linear classifiers with stylistic features such as character and word n-grams (Stamatos, 2009; Koppel et al., 2009). Previous work has shown that different authors can be grouped by their writing style, by factors such as age (Pennebaker et al., 2003; Argamon et al., 2003; Schler et al., 2006; Rosenthal et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2011), gender (Argamon et al., 2003; Schler et al., 2006; Bamman et al., 2014) and mother tongue (Koppel et al., 2005; Tsur and Rappoport, 2007; Bergsma et al., 2012), gender (Argamon et al., 2003; Schler et al datal.)."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "Different writing tasks assigned to an author result in different writing styles for that author.

In both cases, a simple linear model shows measurable differences in writing style, which in turn allows our final model to achieve state-of-the-art results in the Storycloze task. The results presented in this paper have cognitive implications as they motivate further research on the effects that a writing task has on a new author's state of mind, as well as on the design of their data."}, {"heading": "10 Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank Chenhao Tan, Luke Zettlemoyer, Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Rowan Zellers, Yangfeng Ji and several anonymous reviewers for helpful feedback.
