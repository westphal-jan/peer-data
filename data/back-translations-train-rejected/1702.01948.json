However, most user models in the literature do not explicitly consider the temporal behavior of users. More recently, continuous-time user modeling has gained considerable attention and many user behavior models have been proposed based on temporal point processes. However, typical point process based models often considered the impact of peer influence and content on the user participation and neglected other factors. Gamification elements, are among those factors that are neglected, while they have a strong impact on user participation in online services. In this paper, we propose interdependent multi-dimensional temporal point processes that capture the impact of badges on user participation besides the peer influence and content factors. We extend the proposed processes to model user actions over the community based question and answering websites, and propose an inference algorithm based on Variational-EM that can efficiently learn the model parameters. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data gathered from Stack Overflow show that our inference algorithm learns the parameters efficiently and the proposed method can better predict the user behavior compared to the alternatives.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 10:32:42 GMT  (819kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01948v1", "27 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "27 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["ali khodadadi", "seyed abbas hosseini", "erfan tavakoli", "hamid r rabiee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.01948"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.01948.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Continuous-Time User Modeling In the Presence of Badges: A Probabilistic Approach", "authors": ["Ali Khodadadi", "Seyed Abbas Hosseini", "Erfan Tavakoli", "Hamid R.

There is a rich literature that uses user models over the time of the user's activities. Some have focused on describing the aggregated behavior of many people [49,58], while others have focused on individual behavioral models [52,32]. In this direction, the work mainly focuses on the effects of the social network [44] and topics of user activity. However, a large and growing literature has developed on user behavior over time. Most of these methods do not model the time of user activity and only consider time to be covariant."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed Method", "text": "The CQA websites, which have received considerable attention in recent years, incorporate various elements to increase user engagement. These facts make CQA websites a good candidate for the permanent modeling of users in the presence of badges. Hence, we adapt our model for user actions via Stack Overflow.Asking questions and answers to other questions are the two main types of user actions via CQA websites that guarantee the survival of these websites.

Figure 3a shows the results. We should note that the results are averaged across different core types and different users. As can be seen, as training events increase, the performance of the proposed method increases in predicting future events. To evaluate the correctness of the varying EM algorithm, we also plotted the average log probability per event after the E step versus the iteration number in Figure 3b. In variable EM, the log probability should never decrease after the E step [10], and our results match this expectation. It was also noted that the log probability converged only after 4 steps, which is an indicator of rapid convergence of the proposed inference algorithm."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Can the proposed inference algorithm accurately infer the model parameters?", "text": "In order to assess whether the proposed follow-up algorithm is capable of accurately estimating the model parameters, we calculate the average results of the second series and the ranking of the acquired and captured parameters. MRE metrics measures the relative error between the true and estimated parameters. We have averaged the measurements across all time parameters. We have also evaluated how much the order of the parameter values is stored. To this end, we use the Kendall rank coefficient [36]. We have averaged the measurements across all time parameters. We should note that the results are averaged over event types of different kernel types and different users. The first series (Fig. 4a, 4b) shows the average results over time and content parameters in Fig. 4. We should note that the results are averaged over event types of different kernel types and different users."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Temporal Results:", "text": "In Fig. 5, we have broken down the performance of different methods in predicting the time of the next events for both question and answer events. In the log probability metric (Fig. 5d, 5a), the proposed method outperforms the Hawke and Poisson predictions. As can be seen, the performance of the proposed method from questioner to questioner deteriorates because asking more questions is a difficult task and the impact of badges on asking more questions is less than its impact on answering. Therefore, the performance of the proposed method from answering to asking questions deteriorates. For the other two measures, the proposed method also performs better than the competition. Only in MRE metrics, the results of the Hawkes method are better than their impact on answering. This is because the predicted times are generally smaller than the real times, those at smaller MREs it is interesting to note that the results of the Hawkes and Poisson processes are similar for asking questions."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Mark Prediction Results", "text": "We have presented the results of various methods of predicting the marking of test events in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a and Fig. 6c show the precision @ k and NDCG @ k for different methods of predicting the parent of the answers versus different k. In the same way, Fig. 6b and 6d show the precision @ k and NDCG @ k for different methods of predicting the tag of questions versus k. As can be seen, the performance of all methods improves. The proposed method outperforms competitors in predicting both parents and tags. To predict the tag of questions, the newest method produced is close to the proposed method (Fig. 6b, 6d). This is because asking questions is a sequential task, and usually a user asks questions in a domain, namely sequentially. In addition, the fact that users usually produce questions in a limited number of topics (Fig. 2b), the prediction questions for the parent are not the prediction questions, but the prediction time of the big delay of the questions."}, {"heading": "4.3.3 Impact of Kernels and Intertwining the Processes", "text": "Figure 7a shows the effects of Gaussian and exponential cores, which we have previously illustrated in Figure 1, on the log probability of test events. Results show that the Gaussian core functions better in both types of actions than exponential activities. This means that in both question and answer actions, the impact of badges on user activity does not suddenly decrease after receiving the badge. In addition, the badges also have an impact on user activity after receiving the badge. We also investigated the impact of linking processes on the performance of the proposed method. We compared the two versions of the proposed method with the impact of questions on answers and without considering the effect. Figure 7b shows the performance of the two versions based on the log likelihood of test events. As can be seen, the intertwined method works better than the version without taking into account the impact of questions on the process, although these have little impact on the process."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "Unlike previous work on continuous user modeling, which focuses mainly on the impact of peer influence on user actions, the proposed method also takes into account the impact of content and gamification elements, particularly badges, on user actions. We have expanded the proposed method for modeling user questions and response activities through CQA quotes and proposed a follow-up algorithm based on Variable EM that can efficiently learn the model parameters, which can help in categorizing users and understanding their preferences, and this information will help social media owners to create implicit user profiles and provide tailored services. Empirical evaluations of both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the superior predictive power of the proposed method."}], "references": [{"title": "Survival and event history analysis: a process point of view", "author": ["O.

"User modeling plays an important role in delivering customized web services to the users and improving their engagement. However, most user models in the literature do not explicitly consider the temporal behavior of users. More recently, continuous-time user modeling has gained considerable attention and many user behavior models have been proposed based on temporal point processes. However, typical point process based models often considered the impact of peer influence and content on the user participation and neglected other factors. Gamification elements, are among those factors that are neglected, while they have a strong impact on user participation in online services. In this paper, we propose interdependent multi-dimensional temporal point processes that capture the impact of badges on user participation besides the peer influence and content factors.
