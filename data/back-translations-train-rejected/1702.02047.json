This is also due to Lemma 5 and the fact that there are no chains with a length of more than 2 in (L). as defined by [8]. Our examples of algebraic and geometric concept classes show that preference-based teaching can be achieved very efficiently with naturally defined theories and based on intuitive preference relationships such as inclusion. We believe that further studies of the PBTD provide insights into structural properties of concept classes that make them easy or difficult to learn in a variety of formal learning models. We have shown that overarching learning theories lead to a universal construction of preference-based theories that exhibit only positive examples. While this result is fairly obvious, it represents precisely those teaching models that are based on (3) teaching models."}, {"heading": "A Proof of Theorem 2", "text": "In section A.1 we present a general result that helps to verify the upper limits in theorem 2.

complexity parameter\u2014the preference-based teaching dimension (PBTD)\u2014representing the worst-case number of examples needed to teach any concept in a given concept class. Although the PBTD coincides with the well-known recursive teaching dimension (RTD) on finite classes, it is radically different on infinite ones: the RTD becomes infinite already for trivial infinite classes (such as half-intervals) whereas the PBTD evaluates to reasonably small values for a wide collection of infinite classes including classes consisting of so-called closed sets w.r.t. a given closure operator, including various classes related to linear sets over N0 (whose RTD had been studied quite recently) and including the class of Euclidean half-spaces. On top of presenting these concrete results, we provide the reader with a theoretical framework (of a combinatorial flavor) which helps to derive bounds on the PBTD.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
