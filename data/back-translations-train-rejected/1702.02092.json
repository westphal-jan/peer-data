Methodology", "text": "We used 18 / hVd / words from AusTalk, an Australian language research corpus collected from speakers of Australian English [3]. To investigate the sensitivity of our phonetic model to dialect, the system was trained using a subset of manually annotated data (phonemes and start / end points) from three other speakers, General Australian (21 speakers), educated Melbournians (21 aged 25-34) or speakers of Chinese (14), and the resulting labeled card was used to separate the unlabeled SOM unit 25x25 using all audio windows from the unlabeled data."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "Frequently confused phonemes (on the first map) were identified using a greedy method based on high diagonal values in the confusion matrix of the base map: \u2022 vowel group 1: / oI / (hoyd) and / o: / (horde) \u2022 vowel group 2: / e / (head), / e: / (hairy), / 3: / (herd), / I / (hidden) and / I @ / (heard) \u2022 vowel group 3: / 5 / (hud), / \u00e6O / (howd), / \u00e6I / (hade), / 5: / (hard), / Ae / (hidden), / O / (hod) and / @ 0 / (hode) 1MATLAB scripts are available to authors on request. Scripts for MFCCs were mixed up by mathlabcentral / fileexchange / 32849-htk-mfcput.The Chinese vocal method was compared with the vowel method, whereby 1 was the most frequent."}, {"heading": "4. Discussion", "text": "The aim of the experiments carried out in this paper was to investigate the general ability of marked data to show characteristics of the dialect in the unlabelled language of Australians of Chinese background and educated Melbournians in general versus Australians in general. Results compete with the original phonetic typewriter results and show effectiveness with 39 characteristics of MFCC vectors. There is an opportunity to improve these in context, but for the future direction of this research we are more interested in characterising differences between the three groups."}, {"heading": "5.
