INTRODUCTION", "text": "The importance of occupancy information for building climate control has been studied by various researchers [2]. Since measuring occupancy by sensors is not always practicable, as in commercial buildings, Liao and Barooah [3] developed an integrated approach (an agent-based model) \"to simulate the behavior of all occupants of a building and extract reduced graphic models from Monte Carlo simulations of the agent-based model.\" Other approaches, such as \"information technology enabled sustainability testing,\" [4] an RFID-based system [5], power consumption [6] and other different sensor strategies [7] [8] were applied for the same purpose: occupancy detection. Other authors addressed this problem with gas sensors / concentrations, especially CO2, for occupancy estimates [9] [10]. Neural IEC network models were less explored for this purpose: occupancy detection or energy procurement decisions by occupancy literature C (space allocation decisions)."}, {"heading": "2. METHODOLOGY", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Dataset", "text": "The Extech SD800 Datalogger collected indoor climate data on relative humidity, air temperature (tin) and carbon dioxide concentrations in two classrooms (classrooms 2.04 and 2.10) of the secondary school in Pombal, Portugal, between April 3 and 16, 2013. Measurements were taken at intervals of 60 \u00b0 C. Due to normal classroom operation, the instrument was located at a height of 2.70 m above the ground in the middle of one of the rooms, and thus did not fully comply with ISO 7726 recommendations. The two classrooms have a similar area and volume of about 50 m2 and 141 m3 respectively. The main difference was that one classroom was oriented northwest and the other southeast. Both classrooms were equipped with centralized systems for generating heat and renewing air, which were provided by air conditioners with heating and cooling coils."}, {"heading": "2.2. Multi-layer perceptron model", "text": "The model used to reconstruct classroom occupancy was a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) [13], trained by a robust reverse propagation algorithm with weight traceability (RPROP +).The MLP model is a networked network of units in a forward-looking manner, which means that information flows only in a forward-looking manner. The basic unit of the model is the neuron or node. The neuron summarizes the weighted signals from the previous layer of neurons and transmits the new signal to the next layer according to an activation function - in this case a logistic sigmoid function. The first layer is the input layer, in which a vector of variables is used to predict an output. The MLP model used in this case combines two of three types of environmental variables (relative humidity, air temperature and carbon dioxide concentration), which correspond to the average of all 5."}, {"heading": "3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "After determining the structure of the MLP model, it was trained with a threshold of 0.03. 75% of the data set was used for training and the remaining 25% for validation. At the end of the training, the model showed an accuracy in the validation rate of MSE = 1.99 occupants, the determination coefficient R2 = 0.96 with a significance of the p-value < 0.001 and an average absolute error MAE = 1 occupant. Figure 2 shows CO2 and RH as well as the reported and MLP estimated occupancy for classroom 2.04. It is possible to observe that the estimates tend to follow the reported values and simultaneously predict re-use periods not included in the attendance reports. However, there is also a tendency to underestimate the number of occupants immediately after the end of occupation of the room, thereby predicting negative values. These changeable predictions can be justified by the fact that rooms are not occupied by the change in the size of the movement of the room, and the change in the volume of the air are not occupied."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this context, various model structures were tested to reconstruct classroom occupancy in secondary schools.The models with CO2 input variables showed the best accuracy, and so the model chosen - the model that offers the best prediction possibilities - was the RH & CO2 model with 18 and 13 neurons in the hidden layers. Overall, this work represented the preparatory work for using an MLP model with satisfactory accuracy in determining the number of residents in two classrooms of a secondary school. However, future work is necessary to improve the overall performance of the model and compare it with other forecasting methods."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The work presented is part of the Energy for Sustainability Initiative of the University of Coimbra (UC), which is supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through COMPETE - Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o (POCI) as part of the Ren4EEnIEQ project (PTDC / SEM-ENE / 3238 / 2014 and POCI-01-0145FEDER-016760), respectively.
