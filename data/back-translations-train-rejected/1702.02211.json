However, the more widespread systems learning these arrangements are limited to dealing with conventional morphology, Learning overt affixes and their interactions with stems (Creutz and Lagus, 2005; Soricut et al, 2011; Goldsmith et al, 2000; Pasha et al, 2014; Buckwalter, 2004)."}, {"heading": "2 Root-and-Pattern Morphology Illustration", "text": "In Semitic languages, a pattern (bound morphem) is applied to a root (free morphem) to produce a word. Generally, the roots consist of 3 consonants; example: (to write, kataba, ktb) (Aljlayl and Frieder, 2002). Patterns encode the placement of the 3 consonants in relation to the letters added, one example being C1AC2iC3. Here, the vowel \"A\" is placed between the first and second consonants and the vowel \"i\" between the second and third consonants. In our example, this pattern is applied to the 3-consonant root, which is the resulting word (scribe, kAtib, ktb). This pattern encodes the agent \"agent\" and the agent \"vertience.\""}, {"heading": "3 Learning of Morphological Rules", "text": "Our proposed method is based on three models: an orthographic model for concatenated morphology and an orthographic model for root and pattern morphology signal all possible morphological (candidate) rules and all possible (candidate) pairs of morphologically related words from an orthographic perspective. Then a semantic model confirms whether a candidate rule is morphologically valid and whether a word pair is morphologically related. Existing approaches to root and pattern morphology in literature tend to be a set of orthographic rules defining the model; the heavy dependence on expert linguistic rules naturally leads to poor coverage. Moreover, the orthographic rules disregard the semantically motivated morphological transformation. For example, the word pair (based on these morthographic models) establishes a morthographic relationship between the available patterns and morthographic analysis."}, {"heading": "3.1 Orthographic Models", "text": "In order to recognize morphological rules from an orthographic point of view, we define two models, one for concatenated morphology and one for root and pattern morphology."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Concatenative Morphology", "text": "In concatenating morphology, affixes hang on a stem (Siegel, 1974), so we model concatenated morphology as the process of deleting from one end of the word followed by insertions at the same end. For example, the words (desk, maktab, mktb) and (desk, almaktab, lmktb) are considered morphologically from an orthographic point of view, with 0 deletions at the beginning of the word followed by two insertions (a, l), which would contribute to the candidate rule (prefix, \u03c6, al), another example would be the word pair (desk, almaktab, lmktb) and (desk, wamaktab, wmktb), on the basis of this model they would be linked by two deletions (a, l) and two insertions (w, a), and this pair would contribute to the rule (prefix, al, wa)."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Root-and-Pattern Morphology", "text": "All Semitic languages have in common the following two characteristics of the relations between roots and their pattern-related words at the orthographic level (Greenberg, 1950): \u2022 Roots are predominantly triliteral. \u2022 The root consonants (C1, C2, C3) retain their relative order after they have combined with a pattern to form a word. In Table 1, for example, the word kAtib would be compared with the tri-literal root cottage, and consequently the template C1AC2iC3 would be regarded as a root and pattern template."}, {"heading": "3.2 Semantic Model", "text": "Not every word pair that obeys the orthographic properties is a morphologically related pair. To determine, for example, that a word pair that obeys the orthographic properties is actually morphologically related, we use the semantic relationship between the words via word representations. This is because word representations and their geometry encode syntactical-semantic relationships in vector space (Mikolov et al., 2013b). Consider, for example, the two pairs: (1) (written, kataba, ktb), (desk, maktab, mktb)) and (2) (played, la'iba, l'b) (playing field, ml'b). We can check that abmal is a word, maktab, mktb ', mktb) and (2) (played, la'iba, l'b), (playing field, ml'b), a similar pattern."}, {"heading": "3.3 Algorithmic Implementation", "text": "Our approach is inspired by (Soricut and Och, 2015) which, limited to concatenated morphology, serves as the primary mechanism for generating the concatenated morphological rules for the languages in our study. Our contribution consists in adapting their approach to non-concatenative morphology. Our system is implemented in 4 steps: 1. generation of vocabulary rules in our system (1. generation of vocabulary rules), 2. generation of candidates (root, derived) pairsgrouped into sentences based on the underlying orthographic transformation. These sentences represent the morphological rules in our system. (2. generation of candidates), 3. generation of graphers using the semantic and orthographic model. (Validation of candidate rules).4. Validation of candidate rules we are asmorphologically related. (Validation of the rules).The result is a set of morphological, semantic and their rules and the rules are presented."}, {"heading": "4 JZR: Root Extractor", "text": "Let Radd be all the concatenated rules of the form (appendices, attachments, attachments added), as well as all the root and pattern rules, and Rrep be all the concatenating rules of the form (appendices, attachments deleted, attachments added). Faced with a word w whose root must be extracted, we are looking for rule r \u02da, the solution to the following optimization problem: max rscorew semprq r P Raddscorer semprq \u0105 tr semscorer semorthprq \u0105 tr orth scorew semppw 1, wq P SSrq \u0105 tw semIn the above optimization problem, tr sem, tr orth, tw sem are adjustable hyperparameters. The solution r \u02da and w clearly identify w1. Thus, the system extracts w1 and iterates it over w1 until it reaches a triliteral word."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments and Results", "text": "In this section, we evaluate our method in various ways in three different languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic), first qualitatively evaluating our method by checking the root and pattern rules it discovers in the three languages, then quantitatively evaluating JDR by comparing its accuracy with the widely used Arabic ISRI root extractor (Taghva et al., 2005) on a sample of 1200 words."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "For each of the three languages, we use the readily available Polyglot1 word representations and vocabulary.

All 30 rules in each of the three languages were considered correct, confirming the linguistic agnosticity and performance of our uncontrolled approach."}, {"heading": "5.3 Intrinsic Evaluation on Arabic", "text": "In this experiment, we look at three Arabic root extractors: JZR, JZR (limited), and ISRI, and evaluate them using a sample of 1200 words. JZR (limited) is a version of JZR that is limited to concatenating morphology, whereas the comparison reflects the added value of the root and pattern rules discovered. Results (summarized in Table 2) show: (1) JZR compares favorably with ISRI, a carefully developed rules-based and language-specific root extractor (2) that limits JZR to concatenating morphology, reflecting the importance of the non-concatenating rules covered by JZR. We also maintain that this decline is an underestimation of the importance of the root and pattern rules learned. We discuss this claim in detail in Appendix A, along with further analysis of the results and sample results."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "This paper presents an unattended method for discovering the morphology of roots and patterns in Semitic languages. The discovered rules serve to extract Semitic roots, which are the basic units of these languages. Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations of these rules allow us to validate both our pattern recognition method and our root extraction method (JDR), with performance not too far removed from a rules-based language-specific (in this case Arabic) root extractor."}, {"heading": "A Discussion", "text": "We believe that the drop in performance in limiting JDR to concatenated morphology underestimates the abundance of root and pattern morphology in Arabic. This is because the way we define concatenated morphology could capture the morphology of root and pattern patterns under strict conditions. For illustrative purposes, we have collected 5 representative examples in Table 3, in which correct roots are plainly displayed. To illustrate this, let's take the second word in Table 3 as an example. All extractors were able to correct the second example. Although the word was derived from a pattern, JDR (limited) was still able to do it right, as the stem change was close to the edge of the word. To further illustrate this, a word like KitAb is first removed from the \"i\" using the rule (pre, ki, k), and similar to the \"A\" rule using a suffix of JAR."}], "references": [{"title": "Building an ef", "author": ["Kanaan", "Alaa Al-Nobani"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Kanaan and Al.Nobani.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Kanaan and Al.Nobani.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Efficient estimation of word", "author": ["frey Dean"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Dean.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dean.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Using stemming in morphological analysis to improve arabic information retrieval", "author": ["Nasredine Semmar", "Meriama Laib", "Christian Fluhr."], "venue": "verbum ex machina page 317.", "citeRegEx": "Semmar et al\\.,? 2006", "shortCiteRegEx": "Semmar et al\\.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Topics in English morphology", "author": ["Dorothy Carla Siegel"], "venue": "Ph.D. thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "citeRegEx": "Siegel.,? \\Q1974\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Siegel.", "year": 1974}, {"title": "Application of lemmatization and summarization methods in topic identification module for large scale language modeling data filtering", "author": ["Lucie Skorkovsk\u00e1."], "venue": "International Conference on Text, Speech and Dialogue.
