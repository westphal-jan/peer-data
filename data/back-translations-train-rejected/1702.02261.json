{"id": "1702.02261", "review": {"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Feb-2017", "title": "Social media mining for identification and exploration of health-related information from pregnant women", "abstract": "Widespread use of social media has led to the generation of substantial amounts of information about individuals, including health-related information. Social media provides the opportunity to study health-related information about selected population groups who may be of interest for a particular study. In this paper, we explore the possibility of utilizing social media to perform targeted data collection and analysis from a particular population group -- pregnant women. We hypothesize that we can use social media to identify cohorts of pregnant women and follow them over time to analyze crucial health-related information. To identify potentially pregnant women, we employ simple rule-based searches that attempt to detect pregnancy announcements with moderate precision. To further filter out false positives and noise, we employ a supervised classifier using a small number of hand-annotated data. We then collect their posts over time to create longitudinal health timelines and attempt to divide the timelines into different pregnancy trimesters. Finally, we assess the usefulness of the timelines by performing a preliminary analysis to estimate drug intake patterns of our cohort at different trimesters. Our rule-based cohort identification technique collected 53,820 users over thirty months from Twitter. Our pregnancy announcement classification technique achieved an F-measure of 0.81 for the pregnancy class, resulting in 34,895 user timelines. Analysis of the timelines revealed that pertinent health-related information, such as drug-intake and adverse reactions can be mined from the data. Our approach to using user timelines in this fashion has produced very encouraging results and can be employed for other important tasks where cohorts, for which health-related information may not be available from other sources, are required to be followed over time to derive population-based estimates.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 03:19:57 GMT  (477kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02261v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["pramod bharadwaj chandrashekar", "arjun magge", "abeed sarker", "graciela gonzalez arizona state university", "university of pennsylvania)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02261"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.02261.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Social media mining for identification and exploration of health-related information from pregnant women", "authors": ["Pramod Chandrashekar", "Arjun Magge", "Abeed Sarker", "Graciela Gonzalez"], "emails": ["pbchandr@asu.edu", "amaggera@asu.edu", "abeed@upenn.edu", "gragon@upenn.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 2.02 261v 1 [cs.C L] 8"}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "These statistics suggest that the safety of drugs / medicines (we use the terms interchangeable in this paper) is assessed in limited environments, and so the impact of these drugs on certain cohorts (e.g. pregnant women, children or people suffering from certain conditions) cannot be assessed. Spontaneous reporting systems, such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), are used for post-marketing drug safety monitoring and provide a mechanism for reporting adverse events related to drug use. Although these sources accumulate knowledge about drug safety in certain populations, studies have shown that they suffer from various problems, such as underreporting. To overcome these problems, additional sources of information for the pharmaceutical industry are actively used. Studies have shown that 26% of online adults discuss health information via social media, with about 90% of women using online media for health information, and 60% of the use of apps to support pregnancy."}, {"heading": "1.1 Motivation, Goals and Contributions", "text": "Given the limited amount of information available about pregnant women during pre-launch clinical trials, there is a need to explore additional sources of information. \u2022 The presence of large amounts of social media data containing important health information is a strong motivation for developing frameworks to accurately identify a cohort of pregnant women and to capture their social media timelines. \u2022 Perform preliminary analyses of the health time lines extracted to assess their usefulness, identify limitations and set future research objectives. \u2022 The main contributions of the paper are the following: \u2022 We present a framework within which social media data can be used to identify and collect information about pregnant women. \u2022 We show that health time lines collected from social media contain critical health information that can be used in long-term studies. \u2022 We discuss techniques to more accurately analyze pregnancy. \u2022 We can review current outcomes of pregnancy timeles.3 and review timelines."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "However, most of the research in pharmacovigilance and drug monitoring has focused on identifying adverse drug reactions associated with medications. Some previous research has attempted to apply classification techniques to determine adverse drug reactions (ADR), for which two primary techniques have been tried: lexiconbased classification and supervised classification. In lexiconbased classifications [25, 19] a given text is classified as having an ADR, if it meets a set of specified lexical rules. Supervised classifiers include training classifiers using features from annotated data (used as training) to automatically make classification decisions to test data on test data."}, {"heading": "3. METHOD", "text": "Figure 1 illustrates in detail our proposed system, which is roughly divided into three main steps: data collection and classification, user health timeline extraction, and timeline analysis. During data collection, we discuss how to collect cohort timelines from the various interfaces of Twitter and DailyStrength. In the final step of the analysis, we show how to divide timelines into pregnancy trimesters so that trimester-specific information, such as drug use, can be further analyzed. Each of these steps is described in detail in the following subsections."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Collection and Classification", "text": "We have collected tweets from women who announce their pregnancy during a period of thirty months, from January 2014 to September 2016. To identify our initial number of potentially pregnant women, we have used simple search terms for the forms \"i'm * weeks / months pregnant\" and \"i am * weeks / months pregnant,\" with slight variations that add 18 queries. DailyStrength has a very different structure from Twitter, and the site is divided into individual forums for specific cohorts. We have collected our data from five forums on DailyStrength (Pregnancy After Loss Or Infertility, Pregnancy After Inspections, Pregnancy Teens, Stillbirth, and Miscarriage). We have collected all posts from these forums that we use for the use of relatively formal language and low noise scenery, posts from DailyStrength are not subject to pre-processing. In contrast, tweets contain an approximate amount of useful information in them."}, {"heading": "3.2 User Health Timeline Extraction", "text": "After the classification step, all handles of users classified as legally pregnant are identified and we attempt to collect their other posts using the Twitter API. We index all posts in Apache Lucene9 for further analysis. Using the API, we collect all user posts available from the past (i.e. up to the limit allowed by Twitter) and sort them chronologically, and we continue to collect tweets to monitor future health-related events. However, since the forums we select are all pregnancy-related, it is assumed that all users posting on these forums are / were pregnant at some point during their membership on the site. Users can post posts on various forums on the site that may contain interesting information such as medication intake and adverse events. Therefore, for each user who posts a comment on one of the pregnancy-related forums, we record users \"posts on all available forums to create their timelines. Finally, we index each of them in the following timelines:"}, {"heading": "3.3 Timeline Analysis", "text": "The duration of a pregnancy can be divided into three trimesters: the first week 1 to week 12, the second week 13 to week 27 and the third week 28 to the birth. To successfully identify the trimester associated with a posted health event, the information about the second week associated with a posted health event is divided into three trimesters: information about the first week 1 to week 12, second week 13 to week 27 and third week 28 to the birth. Access to the trimestre-trimestre, information about the second week, information about the third week, information about the third week 12 to the next week. Access to the start date of the pregnancy is required. Through our manual inspections of the timelines, we have found that pregnant mothers who announce their pregnancy often give indications about the progress of the pregnancy."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS", "text": "The performance of our classifier was evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation, and the best results of this analysis are presented in Table 2. We compared the performance of the SVM to that of a baseline of Na \ufffd \u0131ve Bayes, which received an F measurement of 0.70 drugs for the isPreg class. Figure 2 shows the ROC curves for each of the 10 folds of cross-validation, including the mean ROC user algorithm for the positive class. However, the range below the user's average ROC curve is 0.82. However, conducting the SVM classification of our collected data led to the discovery of 34,895 legitimate pregnant women out of a total of 53,820 users. We applied our pregnancy trimester extraction algorithm to the 34,895 user timelines, which were classified as legitimate users. Our algorithm detected pregnancy time for 15,523 (approximately 45%) users and was further categorized for each of these timelines."}, {"heading": "5. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We intend to build on this groundwork in several key areas, and the use of more complex detection methods is an important future goal of this study. In addition, from the NLP perspective, our technique does not take into account tensions (e.g. past / present), and therefore the chronological order of posts may not represent the chronological order of events. Furthermore, no mechanism for gender recognition is applied among pregnancy announcement tweets, although our self-classifier attempts to ensure that the users included in the cohort are themselves truly pregnant. Among other things, we intend to add spelling errors, spelling variations, phonetic variations and abbreviations to the drug list. Similar to drug use pattern extraction, we could use a method for classifying diseases and disorders to classify mentions of diseases that would explain the reason why certain individuals consume a particular drug, and enhance the classification steps that we are currently taking to improve the effectiveness of a particular drug."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this post, we presented the novel idea of collecting health-related longitudinal information via targeted social media cohorts. In this study, we focused on the cohort of pregnant women - a group that is not involved in pre-market clinical trials. We presented a pipeline that includes three phases - cohort identification, collection, and analysis. We discovered that a large number of pregnant women can be identified with high accuracy through a combination of rule-based and machine learning techniques. We discussed how to capture health-related timelines from two different social networks. Finally, we demonstrated how to time-categorize the timeline, and we confirmed that trimester-specific health information can be derived from pre-processed timelines. We discussed several limitations of our work that will be taken into account in future research. Crucially, while we focused exclusively on one cohort, our pipeline may not be generalizable for other population groups."}, {"heading": "7.

"year": 2017, "abstractText": "Widespread use of social media has led to the generation of substantial amounts of information about individuals, including health-related information. Thus, social media provides the opportunity to study health-related information about selected population groups who may be of interest for a particular study. In this paper, we explore the possibility of utilizing social media data to perform targeted data collection and analysis from a particular population group\u2014 pregnant women. We hypothesize that we can use social media to identify cohorts of pregnant women and follow them over time to analyze crucial health-related information. To identify potentially pregnant women, we employ simple rule-based searches that attempt to detect pregnancy announcements with moderate precision. To further filter out false positives and noise, we employ a supervised classifier using a small number of hand-annotated data. Following the identification of a reasonably sized cohort, we collect their posts over time to create longitudinal health timelines and attempt to divide the timelines into different pregnancy trimesters. Finally, we assess the usefulness of the timelines by performing a preliminary analysis to estimate drug intake patterns of our cohort at different trimesters. Our rule-based cohort identification technique collected 53,820 users over thirty months from Twitter. Our pregnancy announcement classification technique achieved an F-measure of 0.81 for the pregnancy class, resulting in 34,895 user timelines. Analysis of the timelines revealed that pertinent health-related information, such as drug-intake and adverse reactions can be mined from the data. Our approach to using user timelines in this fashion has produced very encouraging results and can be employed for an array of other important tasks where cohorts, for which health-related information may not be available from other sources, are required to be followed over time to derive population-based estimates.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
