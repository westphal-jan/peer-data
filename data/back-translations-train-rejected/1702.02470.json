Besides being the basis for efficient param-eterized algorithms, this method also provides a wealth of information to reason about in the context of constraint programming. We study the use of kernelization for designing propagators through the example of the Vertex Cover constraint. Since the classic kernelization rules often correspond to dominance rather than consistency, we introduce the notion of \"loss-less\" kernel. While our preliminary experimental results show the potential of the approach, they also show some of its limits. In particular, this method is more effective for vertex covers of large and sparse graphs, as they tend to have, relatively, smaller kernels.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 15:45:39 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02470v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["cl\\'ement carbonnel", "emmanuel h\\'ebrard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02470"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.02470.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Emmanuel Hebrard"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 2.02 470v 1 [cs.A I] 7 Feb 2"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2 Background and Notations", "text": "An undirected graph is a child pair G = (V, E), where V is a series of vertices and E is a series of vertices, that is, pairs in V (V).

The subgraph of G = (V, E), induced by a subset of vertices G, is referred to as G [W] = (W, 2W, E). An independent proposition is a set I V, whose coverage is not a pair of elements in E. A clique is a set C V, so that each pair of elements in C is in E. A clique cover T of a graph G = (V, E) is a collection of subordinate vertices in x."}, {"heading": "3 Kernelization as a Propagation Technique", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Standard Kernelization", "text": "A problem is parameterized if each instance x is paired with a nonnegative integer k, and a parameterized problem is fixable (FPT) if it can be solved in time O (| x | O (1) f (k)) for any function f.
