To reach these goals, we propose a new EEG representation that provides a more realistic view of brain functionality by applying multi-instance (MI) framework to consider the non-stationarity of the EEG signal. The non-stationary characteristic of EEG is considered by describing the signal as a bag of relevant and irrelevant concepts. The concepts are provided by a robust representation of homogenous segments of EEG signal using spatial covariance matrices. Due to the nonlinear geometry of the space of covariance matrices, we determine the boundaries of the homogeneous segments based on adaptive segmentation of the signal in a Riemannian framework. Each subject is described as a bag of covariance matrices of homogenous segments and the bag-level discriminative information is used for classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we examine it in attention deficit hyperactivity/bipolar mood disorder detection and depression/normal diagnosis applications. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach, which is gained due to the robustness of covariance descriptor, the effectiveness of Riemannian geometry, and the benefits of considering the inherent non-stationary nature of the brain.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 23:56:32 GMT  (1007kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02655v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["khadijeh sadatnejad", "saeed s ghidary", "reza rostami", "reza kazemi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02655"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.02655.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "by physician knowledge and attitude, with a relatively low agreement in different clinicians\u2019 decision.

MI representation of EEG signal", "text": "Psychiatry is often used as an informative source of non-stationary EEG signals in CAD applications, and could be diagnosed by detecting specific patterns in the electrical activity of the patient. However, the other main sources of non-stationary signals are noise in the environment, artifacts and biological sources that inevitably affect the signal during recording. To represent the different segments of non-stationary signals, we must interpret the segmentation of subjects as a bag of different concepts. Here, concepts are the covariance matrices of homogeneous segments (in a statistical sense) resulting from the adaptive segmentation of EEG signals (Section III). Covariance matrices are approved using covariants."}, {"heading": "1) Log-Euclidean & affine-invariant Gaussian kernel", "text": "The logical-euclidean kernel is defined as: \u00b7 \u2192, (,) = (\u2212 (,)) (9) where, (,) denotes the similarity between concepts based on and on the logical-euclidean distance and is a positive value known as a bandwidth parameter. Since the logical-euclidean Gauss kernel meets a mercer condition for all > 0 [32] (i.e. it is a positive semi-defined kernel), the resulting (,) is the sum of several positive semi-defined (psd) kernels and can be used in any kernel-based learning method."}, {"heading": "2) Isometric kernel", "text": "The isometric nucleus resulting from the application of the method of double centering [33] over the matrix of geodesic distances is an informative nucleus, especially when used in methods based on the local topology of data points. = \u2212 (1 / 2) (11) = \u00b7 \u2212 (1 /) 1 \u00b7 1, where the similarity matrix is, denotes the matrix of geodesic distances, \u00b7 is an \u00b7 identity matrix, and 1 is a slit vector covering all elements 1.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a new representation to describe EEG signals. In this representation, we apply the MI framework to take into account the instationality of the EEG signal; the concepts in this representation are described by the empirical covariance matrix of the EEG segments, which are the result of the adaptive segmentation of the signal and all analyses are carried out within the Rieman framework. Using the MI core to describe the EEG signal is a suitable choice, which increases the discriminatory information by automatically attenuating the noise contribution (i.e. as a constant offset in the measure of similarity). Experimental evidence confirms the significant superiority of this representation in EEG-based CAD applications. This superiority results from considering the instationality of the EEG signal without the need for explicit induction of EEG segments, using the covariance matrix to describe the benefit of these segments, and examining the limitations of the covariance problems of the adaptation of the segments."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The first author thanks in particular Dr. Mathieu Salzmann, Dr. Saeed Sanei and Dr. Reza Boostani for their help and useful discussions."}], "references": [{"title": "Association, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition: DSM-IV-TR\u00ae", "author": ["P.

To reach these goals, we propose a new EEG representation that provides a more realistic view of brain functionality by applying multi-instance (MI) framework to consider the nonstationarity of the EEG signal. The non-stationary characteristic of EEG is considered by describing the signal as a bag of relevant and irrelevant concepts. The concepts are provided by a robust representation of homogenous segments of EEG signal using spatial covariance matrices. Due to the nonlinear geometry of the space of covariance matrices, we determine the boundaries of the homogeneous segments based on adaptive segmentation of the signal in a Riemannian framework. Each subject is described as a bag of covariance matrices of homogenous segments and the bag-level discriminative information is used for classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we examine it in attention deficit hyperactivity/bipolar mood disorder detection and depression/normal diagnosis applications. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach, which is gained due to the robustness of covariance descriptor, the effectiveness of Riemannian geometry, and the benefits of considering the inherent non-stationary nature of the brain.", "creator": null}}}
