We conducted a deployment study with 20 participants during a time span of two weeks. In this paper, we revealed five challenges, along with examples, that we observed in our study based on both user's feedback and chat logs, including (i)the continuum of emotions, (ii)multi-user conversations, (iii)different dynamics between different users, (iv)misclassification of emotions and (v)unconventional content.

To ensure that the viable system performs well, we have introduced the powerful classification module LibSVM (Fan et al. 2008), a tool for supervised learning from support vector machines, and the widely recognized, well-functioning feature Word Embedding to train classification. Word embedding, generated from neural language models, has proven to be a successful feature for classification problems (Bengio et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2012; Mikolov et al. 2013a; Mikolov et al. 2013b). We have adopted pre-trained 300-dimensional word vectors trained under Google News2 and presented each sentence or document as a vector by presenting all the word vectors in the sentence or vector in the documentation."}, {"heading": "Use Case of EmotionPush", "text": "The goal of EmotionPush is to enable end users to better understand the emotions of their interlocutors. \u25cf The most obvious use case we can think of is prioritizing messages according to the emotions they convey. \u25cf Participants confirmed this use case by pointing out that EmotionPush can help them read their messages quickly and manage multiple messages at the same time. However, other use cases are not clear before users want to keep their emotions stable. In the usage study, participants identified some interesting use cases. We list these use cases as follows, along with quotes from participants. \u2022 Emotion Management Participants will be able to decide whether they want to receive some information to keep their emotions stable."}, {"heading": "Different Users", "text": "One risk of classifying emotions solely on the basis of texts is the neglect of the context that is known to have strong correlations with the user's behavior (Baym et al. 2007; Gilbert Wang and Karahalios 2009)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we describe challenges in using an emotion recognition system, EmotionPush, for instant messaging applications. These challenges include the continuum of emotions, multi-user conversations, different dynamics between different users, misclassification and unconventional content. These challenges are not only about automatic affective feedback through the use of word processing technologies, but also about shaping a user experience in the face of interconnected factors such as humanity and languages. Through these discussions, we expect to gain insights into the use of affective data processing applications and motivate researchers to develop tomorrow's solutions. In the future, with the benefit of the developed EmotionPush, we plan to develop a mechanism that encourages users to contribute their content and feedback their emotions in order to drive this technology forward where it is most needed."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The research of this work was partially supported by the Taiwanese Ministry of Science and Technology under the MOST 104-2221-E-001-024-MY2 contract."}, {"heading": "10% 10% 20% 50% 10%", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "10% 10% 35% 30% 15%", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "20% 25% 20% 30% 5%", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "10% 10% 30% 35% 15%", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "50% 20% 25% 5% 0%", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5% 5% 50% 35% 5%", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}], "references": [{"title": "C", "author": ["Alm"], "venue": "O.; Roth, D.; and Sproat, R.", "citeRegEx": "Alm.
