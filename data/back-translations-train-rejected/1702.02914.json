Spatial filters have been widely used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG for BCI classification problems, but their applications in BCI regression problems have been very limited. This paper proposes two common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for EEG-based regression problems in BCI, which are extended from the CSP filter for classification, by making use of fuzzy sets. Experimental results on EEG-based response speed estimation from a large-scale study, which collected 143 sessions of sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task data from 17 subjects during a 5-month period, demonstrate that the two proposed spatial filters can significantly increase the EEG signal quality. When used in LASSO and k-nearest neighbors regression for user response speed estimation, the spatial filters can reduce the root mean square estimation error by 10.02-19.77%, and at the same time increase the correlation to the true response speed by 19.39-86.47%.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Feb 2017 17:44:28 GMT  (525kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02914v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC", "authors": ["dongrui wu", "jung-tai king", "chun-hsiang chuang", "chin-teng lin", "tzyy-ping jung"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02914"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.02914.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Spatial Filtering for EEG-Based Regression Problems in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)", "authors": ["Dongrui Wu", "Jung-Tai King", "Chun-Hsiang Chuang", "Chin-Teng Lin"], "emails": ["drwu09@gmail.com,", "jtchin2@gmail.com,", "cch.chuang@gmail.com,", "Chin-Teng.Lin@uts.edu.au,", "jung@sccn.ucsd.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is a project, which is a project that is first and foremost a project that responds to the needs of people who are able to integrate themselves."}, {"heading": "II.

Voluntary, fully informed consent of the subjects used in this research was obtained in accordance with the requirements of federal and Army regulations [50]. NCTU's Institutional Review Board approved the experimental protocol. All participants registered their fatigue through a smartphone daily and received notifications to report on experimental studies if the effectiveness of their conditions matched the experimental requirement: > 90; normal: [70, 90]; high fatigue: < 70)."}, {"heading": "B. Performance Evaluation Process", "text": "The following procedure was performed to evaluate the performance of different spatial filters: 1) EEG data pre-processing to suppress artifacts and noise; 2) RS data pre-processing to suppress outliers; 3) 5-fold cross-validation to calculate regression performance for each combination of spatial filters and regression method: first randomly split the studies into five equal folds; then compile four folds for monitored spatial filter and regression training and use the remaining fold for the test; repeat this five times so that each fold is used in the test; finally, compile the regression performance with respect to Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Correlation Coefficient (CC). Two regression methods were used: LASSO, whose adjustable parameter was optimized to the training dataset by an internal 5-fold cross-validation; and k-next neighbor (Nksion) compression 5."}, {"heading": "C.

Then, the 62-channel EEG study was used in [tn \u2212 3, tn] seconds to predict the RS, i.e. Xn \u0441R62 \u00b7 768. Each study was then filtered individually by a [1, 20] Hz finite impulse response bandpass filter to make each channel zero average and remove unusable radio frequency components. Since the intervals between the studies consisted of random intervals between 2-10 seconds, it is possible that a 3-second EEG study will cover part of the data from the previous study. Additionally, a study may also contain the EEG oscillations related to the motor response (tap on the touch screen) and then remove the previous study if we have overlapped the previous study: 1 second)."}, {"heading": "D. RS Data Preprocessing", "text": "The upper panel is from a typical subject, whose response times were usually shorter than 1 second. The lower panel is from a subject with potential data acquisition problems, as many response times were longer than 5 seconds, which is highly unlikely in practice. So we excluded this subject from consideration in this work and used only the remaining 16 subjects. As shown in Fig. 3, the response times were very loud, and there were obvious outliers. It is very important to suppress the outliers and noise so that the performance of the different algorithms can be more accurately compared. In addition to the step in the previous subsection to eliminate overlapping studies, we also applied the following 2-step method of pre-processing the response time: 1) Outlier threshold, which aimed to suppress unusually large response times. First, for each subject, a default value of 5 seconds was calculated, with my seat time + 3 inches being the average of each response time."}, {"heading": "E.

This method was almost identical to Raw except that the band-filtered EEG experiments were also spatially filtered by CAR before the 62 x 2 = 124 powerband characteristics were calculated. \u2022 CAR: Theta and alpha powerband characteristics from EEG experiments, the most commonly used spatial filters for EEG, and [31] showed that it helped improve EEG classification performance. \u2022 It simply removes the mean of all channels from each channel. \u2022 OVR: Theta and alpha powerband characteristics from EEG experiments were nearly identical."}, {"heading": "V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "This section compares the informativeness of the features in Raw, CAR, OVR and OVA, but presents the regression performance and also performs parameter sensitivity analyses for algorithm 1.1 We used 21 spatial filters here, so that the filtered signals had roughly the same dimensionality as the original signals, ensuring a fair performance comparison. In section V-C, we also performed sensitivity analyses of the number of spatial filters.6 A. Informativeness of the features Before studying the regression performance, it is important to verify whether the extracted features in Raw, CAR, OVR and OVA are actually meaningful. We chose a typical subject, randomly divided its data into 50% training and 50% testing, and extracted Raw and CAR. We then designed the spatial filters using CSPR-OVR and CSPR-OVA on the training data, and extracted the signal correlation between the signal correlations OVR and OVA."}, {"heading": "B. Regression Performance Comparison", "text": "The RMSEs and CCs of LASSO and kNN with the four feature sets are shown in Figure 6 for the 16 subjects.

The average RMSEs and CCs of all subjects are also shown in the last group of each panel. Observe that CAR had a comparable or slightly better performance than Raw."}, {"heading": "C. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis", "text": "There are two adjustable parameters in CSPR-OVR: K, the number of fuzzy classes for the RSs, and F, the number of spatial filters for each fuzzy class. In this subsection, we examine the sensitivity of regression performance to these two parameters. Regression performance for K = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (F was fixed at 21) is shown in Fig. 8. Algorithm 1 was repeated five times, each with a random partition of training and test data, and the average regression results are shown. For both LASSO and kNN, K = 2 provided the worst performance, but K = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} resulted in roughly the same RMSE and CC. Therefore, K = 3 seems to be a good compromise between performance and compression costs."}, {"heading": "D.

Robustness to Noise", "text": "According to [64], there are two types of noise: class noise, which is noise on the model outputs, and attribute noise, which is noise on the model inputs. In this subsection, we focus on the attribute noise. As in [64], for each model input, we randomly replaced q% (q = 0, 10,..., 40) of all experiments of a subject with a uniform noise between its minimum and maximum values. After this was done for both the training and test data, we extracted feature sets Raw, CAR, OVR, and OVA and trained LASSO and NN on the corrupted training data. Afterwards, we tested their performance on the corrupted test data. The results are shown in Fig. 12: In general, as the noise level increased, performance decreased, which is intuitive."}, {"heading": "F.

DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "Recall that 5-fold cross-validation was used in the performance assessment in the previous section, i.e. we combined data from nine sessions of the same subject, randomly divided them into five folds of the same length, and then used four folds for training and the remaining folds for testing. So the training and test folds contained data from the same sessions. This is equivalent to the case that we called some session-specific data in offline regression. Our results showed that in this case, we could significantly improve CSPR-OVR and CSPR-OVA regression performance. To avoid using session-specific data, we also investigated another validation method: leave-one-session-out validation, in which we trained the spatial filters with eight sessions for each subject and tested them on the remaining session."}, {"heading": "VII.

interfaces (BCIs), but they are easily contaminated by artifacts and noises, so preprocessing must be done before they are fed into a machine learning algorithm for classification or regression. Spatial filters have been widely used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG for BCI classification problems, but their applications in BCI regression problems have been very limited. This paper proposes two common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for EEG-based regression problems in BCI, which are extended from the CSP filter for classification, by making use of fuzzy sets. Experimental results on EEG-based response speed estimation from a large-scale study, which collected 143 sessions of sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task data from 17 subjects during a 5-month period, demonstrate that the two proposed spatial filters can significantly increase the EEG signal quality. When used in LASSO and knearest neighbors regression for user response speed estimation, the spatial filters can reduce the root mean square estimation error by 10.02 \u2212 19.77%, and at the same time increase the correlation to the true response speed by 19.39 \u2212 86.47%.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
