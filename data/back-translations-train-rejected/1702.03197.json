Data Collection", "text": "The data was collected from 01 / 02 / 2016 to 31 / 07 / 2016 via Twitter. Initially, the approach was to retrieve tweets that used some general terms related to health, such as \"hospital,\" \"clinic,\" \"clinic,\" \"healthcare,\" etc. However, most tweets found that this was not useful because they did not express opinions on what the purpose of the study was. Alternatively, observing trending hashtags, which are the most popular topics on Twitter at a given time with many users involved, was more useful. Three topics related to health were addressed as trending hashtags and many users shared their opinions on them. They were as follows: # trending hashtags, which are the most popular topic in the processing of Twitter at a given time, involving many users, are about the closure of a private hospital (closure of hospitals). # This topic concerns the closure of a private hospital (closure of hospitals) and the question of who will solve the health problems (solution of health problems)."}, {"heading": "B.
