In this paper, we explore the possibility of a logical representation of the first order with a scope of negation characterized by Universal Dependencies. To this end, we expand UDepLambda, a framework that converts dependence graphs into logical forms. The resulting UDepLambda \u00ac is able to treat phenomena related to the scope by means of a superior type theory that is relevant not only to denial, but also to universal quantification and other complex semantic phenomena. The original conversion that we have done for English is promising, since the scope of denial can be represented even in the presence of more complex phenomena such as universal quantifiers."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "NUSBJ", "text": "In this step, we transform a dependency diagram into an existing structure. Here, we present the basics of UDepLambda \u00ac, an extension of the UDepLambda framework to convert a UD graph into its corresponding logical form. Like its predecessor, the conversion takes place in four different steps: improvement, binarization, and composition. While the binarization and composition of the individual groups is the same as UDepLambda, the conversion to a higher order differs in order to deal with a universal quantification that can interact with other areas such as negation; the use of FOL expressions based on those used in the Groeningen Meaning Bank (GMB) to connect to a manually annotated semantic bank that can be used for future work. 1The details of the four steps are as follows: enhancement. In this step, we first transform a dependency tree into an existing lambda form to enhancements."}, {"heading": "3 Analysis of negative constructions", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 The quantifier \u2018no\u2019", "text": "We consider the phrase \"No man came,\" along with its dependency trees and logical forms, as shown in Figure 3.As shown in Figure 3 (b), one shortcoming of the original UDepLambda is that it does not cover universal quantification, but even if we were to assign any of the following lambda expressions, which include a material implication to the neg edge (\"man\"), the resulting quantification would have no means for later adjustment of the event. (x)"}, {"heading": "3.2 Negation and universal quantifier", "text": "In addition to quantifiers, which by their nature express negation, as shown in the previous section, the interaction between a negative reference and a non-negative universal quantifier, such as \"everyone,\" arises. Let us take as an example the sentences \"Not every man came,\" which are shown in Figure 4 next to his FOL representation. Compared to the representation of the sentence \"There came no man,\" where the universal quantifier surpasses the negation operator, the construction \"not everyone\" results in the opposite interaction, where the quantifier is within the scope of the \"(corresponding to the meaning\" there was a man who came \"). As shown in the previous section and here in Figure 4 (b), UDepLambda cannot deal with such constructions and gives a meaning where it exists and event, but there is not the unity it performs."}, {"heading": "3.3 Nobody/nothing/nowhere", "text": "As shown in Table 1: \"No one,\" \"nothing\" and \"nowhere\" belong to this class of negation clues, whose parental edge does not identify them as inherently expressive negation. However, with a handwritten list of negation clues in English, we can nowhere recognize them and assign whether these elements are arguments or additions. If an argument, the extent of the negation also includes the event, otherwise the latter is excluded. To achieve this, we compare the sentences \"Nobody came\" and \"John came with nothing,\" along with their dependency graphs and logical forms (Figure 5).The argument \"Nobody came'yields a scope reading where the negation operator scopes.\""}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion and future work", "text": "The conversion processes we present show that it is possible to rely on dependency borders and, in addition, minimal language-dependent lexical information to compose the semantics of the scope of negation. The fact that this formalism is able to correctly compose the scope for many complex phenomena related to the scope of negation is promising. We are currently working to expand this work in two directions: 1. Automatic framework evaluation: In view of the conversion rules presented in this paper, we plan to automatically convert the UD graphs for the sentences in GMB to compare the graph that we automatically generate with a gold standard representation, which would also identify and quantify the errors in our framework. 2. Automatic semantic separation: Given the link between this framework and the GMB, we would like to explore the possibility of forming the conversion in such a way that we do not automatically rely on the conversion."}, {"heading": "A Step-by-step \u03bb-reductions", "text": "* In all derivatives we will use the variable e instead of xe and z, y or x instead of xa.
