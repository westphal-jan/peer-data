The number added or removed is controlled by range parameters we set (2,4). ME copies two relationships after we have connected them to form a target relationship. VP copies a source relationship to form two linked target relationships. VNM is the same as VP, but introduces an additional target relationship to form an N-to-M relationship between the other target relations (2,4).
