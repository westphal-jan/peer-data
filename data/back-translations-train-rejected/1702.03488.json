Previous agents have focused on cost-quality, or cost-time tradeoffs, limiting their real-world applicability. As a step towards this goal we present Octopus, the first AI agent that jointly manages all three objectives in tandem. Octopus is based on a computationally tractable, multi-agent formulation consisting of three components; one that sets the price per ballot to adjust the rate of completion of tasks, another that optimizes each task for quality and a third that performs task selection. We demonstrate that Octopus outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in simulation and experiments with real data, demonstrating its superior performance. We also deploy Octopus on Amazon Mechanical Turk to establish its ability to manage tasks in a real-world, dynamic setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 Feb 2017 04:53:25 GMT  (1478kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03488v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Aug 2017 09:14:08 GMT  (1699kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03488v2", "10 pages, to appear in HCOMP 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC cs.MA", "authors": ["karan goel", "shreya rajpal", "mausam"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03488"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.03488.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Octopus: A Framework for Cost-Quality-Time Optimization in Crowdsourcing", "authors": ["Karan Goel", "Shreya Rajpal"], "emails": ["kgoel93@gmail.com", "shreya.rajpal@gmail.com", "mausam@cse.iitd.ac.in"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In fact, most people who stand up for people's rights are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they don't want."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "One branch of this research focuses on collective classification, which develops aggregation mechanisms to derive the best performance per task in the face of a static set of ballots (Whitehill et al. 2009; Welinder et al. 2010; Oleson et al. 2013; Parameswaran et al. 2012; Kamar et al. 2013), multi-label tasks (Bragg, Maud 2013), and tasks that go beyond multiple-choice answers (Lin, Mausam, and Weld 2012; Dai, Mausam, and Weld 2011), all of which work design agents to accept uniform pay."}, {"heading": "Problem Definition", "text": "An applicant provides a set of n binary tasks. < n > each problem with a 0 / 1 factor.

In the OCTOPUS, each task has its own QUALITY MANAGER, which decides on the basis of the current payment whether it is worthwhile to do another round of voting (light edge) or not (dark edge) for this task. This information is forwarded to the TASKSELECTOR, which selects an available (light) task in order to get to an incoming worker. Based on the current progress of the entire batch, the COSTSETTER decides which payment is to be determined per ballot; this action is carried out at regular intervals. We design OCTOPUS so that it can assign tasks in such a way as and when workers arrive and work immediately in practice, so that it can use crowdsourced marketplaces with full parallelism."}, {"heading": "QualityManager", "text": "An average worker has error parameters.

The POMDP for q maintains a faith state bq over (dq, tq)."}, {"heading": "TaskSelector", "text": "The TASKSELECTOR decides which incomplete task is to be assigned to the next incoming worker. It must behave \"at any time,\" i.e. it must quickly increase the benefit U, because the timing of the final submission is not in its control and the batch is at any time by COSTSETTER.To be prepared for contingencies, the TASKSELECTOR uses a one-step, greedy policy over the expected benefit. We define the priority of each task as the difference between the current benefit (Uq) of q and the expected benefit after obtaining 1 ballot (U \u2032 q) from an average worker (error rate), given the current belief that bq is the QUALITY MANAGER's QUALITY MANAGER.Therefore, QUq = E [U \u2032 q | q] of q | q] \u2212 Uq could be possible. The TASKSELECTOR assigns the task with the maximum benefit of q to the next available worker.

It uses information about the completion of each task to assess whether the number of tasks is being performed on schedule or whether it needs to be accelerated or slowed down.

Instead, we approach by using aggregated statistics on the entire batch of tasks. We describe the state space, the measures, the transitional functions and the rewards of this MDP below.The choice of the best pay per ballot c depends on its current value, and the current degree of completion of the batch."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "We perform three sets of experiments: (i) experiments on simulated data; (ii) offline evaluation on real data; (iii) live experiments on Amazon MTurk (AMT).

This common utility combines the utilities of Dai et al.'s and Gao et al.' s models here, Penalty P represents how important quality is to the requester. Notice that since a POMDP does not know if it is submitting the correct answer, it does not use its belief to estimate the expected power exactly as \u2212 P (1 \u2212 vq).

Extending to the popular fixed budget setting (where \u2211 q Cq is limited) is simple: (i) Never synchronize \u03b8 so that its value in any state is simply the starting value of \u03b8 (which is fixed and known) minus the ballots received, making it a substitute for the costs incurred to date; (ii) Modify the COSTSETTER's reward to give a reward for the total costs (which can now be calculated on the basis of \u03b8) that exceed the budget. Another extension involves the use of a different wording of the QUALITY MANAGER; any algorithm that defines an appropriate policy and from which we can calculate \u03b8 and \u03bd is suitable."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We present OCTOPUS, one of the first AI agents for a triple optimization of total cost, quality of work and completion time in crowdsourcing. The agent combines three different subagents that control quality per task, select the best next task, and determine payment for the entire batch. An essential technical contribution is the calculation of the overall statistics of quality and completeness of the entire batch - this is used as the state for the best determination of the next payment.OCTOPUS exceeds state-of-the-art baseline in a variety of simulated and real scenarios and demonstrates the superiority of our approach. We also demonstrate the applicability of OCTOPUS in the real world by using it directly on AMT. In the future, we hope to develop general formulations of OCTOPUS as a plug-and-play architecture for users."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work is supported by Google Language Understanding and Knowledge Research Fellowships, a Bloomberg Prize, Microsoft Azure Sponsorship, and a Faculty Award from the Indian Government to the third author.
