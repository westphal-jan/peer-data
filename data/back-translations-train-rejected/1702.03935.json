INTRODUCTIONOne of the most rapid and remarkable technological advances in history occurred with the steam engine after the expiration of Watt's patent in 1800. Over a period of 30 years, engineers improved the efficiency of the Cornish high-pressure steam engine by a factor of five [11] (a cumulative improvement of 5.5% per year).Under today's computer and information systems, such a rate of change would be very slow. In the current context of Moore's Law [10] (which loosely represents a doubling of performance every 18 months or an improvement of 60% per year), the rate of technological change in computer technology is 10 times higher than the peak of the Industrial Revolution. As software replaces physics as the system of the world, these exponential changes are becoming evident in ever greater aspects of people's lives today. Twenty years ago, we were the first to demonstrate a commodity computing cluster (Figure 1) that competed with specialized HPC architectures [18], and some were associated with the construction of a traditional system [4]."}, {"heading": "II. ORIGINS OF THE CLOUD", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want."}, {"heading": "III. ARCHITECTURAL CONSIDERATIONS", "text": "One of the key advantages of the cloud is immediate access to huge amounts of computers. In our experience, it is common for thousands of cores to be spun in a minute or two, in stark contrast to a typical shared supercomputer, where workstations often queue for hours or days. As time passes, the cost of installing computers and computers increases."}, {"heading": "A. Everything is a File", "text": "While the cloud has many of the practical difficulties of accessing the system, it is unable to solve a simple problem. A particularly big stumbling block for large amounts of data is the API. Another reason is that we are not able to get a grip on the system."}, {"heading": "B. Festivus", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is not a purely formal solution, but a purely formal one."}, {"heading": "C. Domain Decomposition", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is not a country, but in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a region and in which it is a country."}, {"heading": "IV. PERFORMANCE", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107", "text": "In fact, it is a mere red herring."}, {"heading": "B. Festivus bandwidth", "text": "To test the scalability of our FUSE-based file system, we performed a performance test in which we evaluated a random subset of our processed Landsat 8 images (different by node) from Google cloud storage down to a distributed set of 512 16 vCPU n1-standard 16 virtual machines in the us-central1-c zone. We measured an aggregated incoming bandwidth for calculating nodes across the project of over 231 GB / s. In Table III, we show bandwidth while scaling up from a single us-central1-c node to 512 nodes. A 32 vCPU node reaches over 70% of its network capacity (Fig. III). In the transition from 16 to 64 nodes, we observe a decrease in bandwidth per node from about 1 GB / s to 500 MB / s, possibly due to network bandwidth sharing between nodes."}, {"heading": "V. APPLICATIONS", "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "B. Field segmentation", "text": "The analysis of satellite images taken at the pixel level fails due to an obvious source of additional information. The results of such an analysis should be highly spatially correlated, as nearby pixels are likely to have the same land use. In the case of agriculture in particular, the land is divided into fields planted with the same crop and subsequently subjected to very similar conditions. Thus, identifying the pixels belonging to the same fields leads to improved analysis results. Figure 4 shows the segmentation into fields of one of our UTM tiles covering a part of the Kherson Oblast in southern Ukraine that borders the Dnieper River. The tile is 6144 x 6144 pixels at a resolution of 10 m. Segmentation is produced by multispectral images from NASA Landscape 7 and Landsat 8 satellites collected since 2011, as well as from the ESA Sentinel 2A satellites collected since the beginning of their mission in June 2015."}, {"heading": "C. Cloud-free composite images", "text": "We used the virtual file system described above to create a 15-meter-long, cloud-free composite image of the world using all of Landsat 8 \"s pre-September 2016 data (Figure 5).The input for this calculation consists of 68 TB of JPEG 2000-compressed images and includes 3.4 years of Earth observation, the output being a weighted average of these images, with a higher emphasis on cloud-free, green input images. Work was slightly paralleled by dividing the Earth's surface into 43k square tiles, each tile being processed independently, and distributed over 400 32-vCPU-preemptive instances, taking 8 hours, for a total of 100k CPU hours and costing $1000.A similar composite image was announced by the Google Maps team in 2016 at https: / / maps.googleblog.com / 2016 / 06 / keep-earth-date-looking.html. We need at least 75 hours per day of land looking.html."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "While accelerated architectures are being explored in the exa-scale race with the associated disruption of established software interfaces, the cloud offers an alternative convergent architecture that can exploit economies of scale and continue to protect application investments across generations of hardware. While Landsat took more than 40 years to collect one petabyte of data, the planet's satellite constellation [5] will produce many petabytes next year. In this work, we have shown that cloud computing architectures are suitable for at least one important class of data-intensive scientific analysis."}, {"heading": "VII.
