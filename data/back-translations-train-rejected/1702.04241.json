INTRODUCTION", "text": "The obvious reason for this is that people can share information with others around the world via email, chat, community forums, SMS, etc. However, this technological revolution also has a dark side. As it shares the information, people sometimes use jargon words that openly appear in various public community forums. This type of malfunction on the Web has both immediate and long-term effects on society. Few anti-social communities use this medium with malicious intent to spread rumor and violence. Recently, governments in different countries have taken various steps to protect the malfunctions over the Internet and the telecommunications system, as the use of a few specific words in the SMS service is restricted, only a few selected pages are blocked, and discussions in community forums are tightly monitored, etc. This algorithmic approach can detect the jargon words in various e-texts when used as a section in the SMS service; some selected pages are blocked, and discussions in community forums are tightly monitored, etc."}, {"heading": "2. MOTIVATION", "text": "In Pakistan, the use of about 1700 specific words on any kind of communication medium is strictly prohibited. In the US, CHINA and a few countries, access to a few websites is limited. Recently, the Indian government has warned only a few community websites against monitoring the data shared by their systems. This proposed algorithm can filter offensive words and suspicious word forms in an e-text if they are shared on a medium."}, {"heading": "3. BACKGROUND", "text": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) [1] is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of research in recent days. Many research activities are carried out in various sub-areas of the NLP, such as Information Retrieval (IR), Automated Classification [7], Language Translation by Machine [4, 5, 6], Word Sense Disambiguation [9, 10, 17], Part of Speech Tagging [15, 16], Anaphora Resolution [11], Paraphrasing [12], Malapropism [13], Collocation Testing [14], etc. This research is heavily dependent on some knowledge-driven methods [8]. WordNet [2, 18, 20] is a knowledge resource that is widely used in various knowledge-based research projects. The main characteristics of this knowledge base are that it is machine-readable and in this knowledge base the words are arranged semantically rather than alphabetically."}, {"heading": "4. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own if they do not put themselves in a position to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "5. OUTPUT AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The experiment began with a data set of commonly used slang words (Figure 7) and a table consisting of different synsets and related concepts (Figure 8), each of which is assigned a weight from the real-life experience (\"assgval\" in Figure 8), which is then used for learning mechanisms. For experiments, few Greek words are considered slang words. In Figure 9, the input text continues because there is no jargon word in the input text. Figure 10 shows the existence of few slang words in an input text. Figure 11 shows the recognition of sound-like abbreviated forms in a text. Figure 12 shows the recognition of suspicious words in an input text. If the user accepts a suspicious word as a jargon word, the suspicious words are stored in the jargon word used for further decision-making."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "This algorithm recognizes the rarely used jargon words, various abbreviations of jargon words, and suspicious words from an e-text used in any open medium. If the learning mechanism is handled with the right synthesis and probability analysis, the algorithm can solve a major problem of recent days. But, in some cases, such as the medical field, the justice system, etc., few words are used that are considered jargon words in our normal lives."}], "references": [{"title": "Computational Processing of Natural Language: Tasks, Problems and Solutions", "author": ["A.
