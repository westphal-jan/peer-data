Background", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Knowledge tracing", "text": "Knowledge Tracing (Corbett & Anderson, 1994) (KT) is a framework for modelling the process by which students learn one or more skills while performing a sequence of assessments. t is an unobserved binary variable that indicates whether or not the student has mastered these skills, and Xt is an observed binary variable that indicates the correctness value of the completed assessment. t is used to capture the statistical relationships between these. Emission probabilities determine how likely a correct answer to each hidden state is to be given. Transitional probabilities determine how a student passes between the hidden states. Several KT variants have been proposed to deal individually with the skills, multiple skills, assessment difficulties and external tools (see (Khajah et al., 2014) and the references contained therein."}, {"heading": "2.2. Item response theory", "text": "Item Response Theory (IRT) (Lord, 1980; Rasch, 1993) is a framework for modelling binary student responses based on a series of assessments. In the two-parameter formulation, the probability of a student correctly answering a grade q is given by the following factors: psq = f (\u03b1q (\u03b8s \u2212 \u03b2q)) (1), where \u03b8s is the student performance, \u03b2q is the assessment difficulty, and \u03b1q is the assessment discrimination that determines how sensitive the probability of correctness is to student performance. Function f (.) is known as the item response function and rises monotonously from 0 to 1. We select f (x) = \u03a6 (x), the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. This model is known as the two-parameter give or 2PO model (Rasch, 1993). An underlying assumption of this model is that the student skills (successes over a period of IRZ) are more consistent over a period of time than the IRZ, and that the responses remain constant over a period of time during IRZ)."}, {"heading": "3.

Structured, multidimensional prior over student proficiencies", "text": "If the content pool is very diverse, the summary of students \"competence with a single number (which varies over time) may not be sufficient to capture students\" reaction patterns. Content can be organized into groups that measure students \"competence, called knowledge components (Corbett et al., 1997) or skills (Lindsey et al., 2014; Lan et al., 2014) The content used in our experiments has been grouped by subject experts into groups called concepts. Each student's competence at a single point in time is now represented by a vector of knowledge in each concept (Lindsey et al., 2014; Lan et al., RC is the total number of concepts. \u2212 The IRT probability (Eq. 1) can then be represented as: psq = f (\u03b1q)."}, {"heading": "4. Experimental setup", "text": "The data was collected from a variety of educational products that are integrated into Knewton's adaptive learning platform and are used in different classrooms around the world. These products differ in terms of educational content used (disciplines included math, science, and English) as well as the way students are guided through the content. In other products, students start from scratch and work toward a teacher-defined goal. In all of these settings, Knewton receives data on each interaction (anonymized student ID, content module ID, correctness, and timestamp) We used approximately 1 million responses from 6.3K randomly selected students to 105.6K questions spanning about 4 months. Students who completed a total of less than 5 questions were excluded. For each student-question pair, only the most recent 4 answers were used to avoid long strands of multiple question attempts. After preprocessing, students \"histories stretched from 3.5 to a total of 3.2K (including these answers)."}, {"heading": "5. Results", "text": "We compare the following student response models: \u2022 Student Percentage Correction (SPC): prediction correct if and only if the majority of previous answers is correct for the student. \u2022 2PO IRT: standard IRT model, the equivalent of Eq. 9 with 0 and \u03bb = 1.0. \u2022 2PO temporal IRT: same IRVN 2PO IRT: factorial multivariate Gaussian before knowledge per concept (labeled by experts), using Eq. 15 with \u03bd = 0, \u03b3 = 0 and \u03bb = 1.0. \u2022 Correlated MVN 2PO IRT: same as above, but with g = 0.5. \u2022 Correlated MVN temporal 2PO temporal accuracy per concept (T-SKIRT): same as above, but with g = 0.5, bar = 0.1. To compare model performance in a task relevant for online adaptive learning systems, we measured the accuracy of the prediction of each student's previous reaction given in the previous student's history only."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "We developed a model, T-SKIRT, for predicting student responses that addresses two major challenges facing an adaptive learning system: taking into account student learning and dealing with the diversity of student skills and content characteristics. We evaluated this model based on a task required in a production environment (predicting a student's next response taking into account all previous responses) and found that, despite the large variability in content discipline, grade level and learning environment, incorporating temporality into the model had significant advantages over standard IRT models. We also found that conceptual groupings and expert-provided precondition relationships also had a significant improvement compared to expert labels (Lindsey et al., 2014) that did not result in better predictions of this model. Our model can be improved or expanded in several ways. For example, the time model can be supplemented with observable events, such as when a learning concept is likely to occur."}], "references": [{"title": "Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge", "author": ["Corbett", "Albert T", "Anderson", "John R"], "venue": "User modeling and user-adapted interaction,", "citeRegEx": "Corbett et al\\.,?
