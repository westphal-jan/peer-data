Each game implements some kind of machine learning task, so we need its own archetype for implementing AI methods. This first archetype is called \"Samu, the Brain.\" Practically, this archetype uses the machine learning tasks currently available. http: / / www.tensorflow.org / tutorials / mnist / beginners / alphago-mastering-ancient-gameof-go.html4MNIST For ML Beginners, https: / / www.tensorflow.org / tutorials / mnist / beginners / algorithms and paradigms (with the primary focus on deep learning), and it can be expanded in the future. As the correct use and sometimes even understanding of these machine learning primitives can be difficult."}, {"heading": "2.1 Samu, the Brain", "text": "The main purpose of this archetype is to execute TF graphs. Our main question is what is the most suitable ML architecture for such a task? There are several well-known ML architectures that perform well on different sets of data. In recent years, Convolutionary Neural Networks (CNN) [LBBH98] have made a reasonable breakthrough in the field. One of the earliest works that had a major impact was reported by Krizhevsky et al. in [KSH12], which architecture used five revolutionary layers and three fully connected layers and introduced several new solutions (e.g. \"dropout\"). Another approach is the Inception architecture, which was first introduced in [SLJ + 14], an architecture that was 22 layers deep, which ignited the proliferation of very deep CNNs. Later, the Inception architecture was improved to achieve better performance [SVI + 15]. The previously mentioned solutions were tested on the Open ImageNet Dataset."}, {"heading": "2.2 Gre\u0301ta, the Builder", "text": "In the game Face Battle, the Motherboard Builder is our first fast prototype 5 for the GTB archetype. A central point of this motherboard approach is that we can place various objects related to computing on its interface. The idea arose from the appearance and functionality of a motherboard on a desktop computer. Just like a real one, it can be equipped with several different \"devices\" that can later be modified, modified or updated. In terms of an ESAMU game, these objects can be TF nodes (e.g. a CNN layer). It is not uncommon for a TensorFlow diagram to have several thousand nodes. For example, the model of the TF tutorial example MNIST contains 137 nodes, but more sophisticated ones can contain tens of thousands of nodes."}, {"heading": "2.3 Na\u0301ndi, the Teacher", "text": "In the game Face Battle, this archetype implements a number of possible annotations and corrections to the images captured by players.

In Face Battle, it is used for photo capture. It is important to implement this archetype in Face Battle, as we only want to collect images of faces. Therefore, some kind of pre-processing is required, such as face segmentation or alignment. In addition, this part of the software will also have an emotion recognition function."}, {"heading": "2.4.1 Face Battle Dataset", "text": "For each ESAMU game, different datasets are required to perform machine learning tasks. Open datasets for testing facial recognition methods are becoming common practice, the number of open datasets is increasing (see e.g.: [LMHR + 16], [YLLL14], [LLWT15], [ZZWS12], [KSSMB16], [NW14]). In our basic concept, each game has its own dataset and each dataset is open, and each subset is linked via a social network profile to a specific player who has collected the corresponding data. To our knowledge, this will be the first public dataset in which images are associated with humans, except for datasets related to celebrities."}, {"heading": "2.5 Erika, the Fighter", "text": "This archetype will provide the opportunity to build a competition around Face Battle. This will be the part of the game where players can compare each other's \"learning architecture,\" or more precisely, the efficiency (i.e. the error rate) of their face classification process. One benefit could be that players will give each other some images of themselves. After learning these images, the accuracy of classifying other images of the same player will be compared, and the player with the better accuracy will win the battle."}, {"heading": "3 Entropy Non-increasing Interfaces of Games", "text": "First of all, entropy should not be understood as increasing ownership of elements of the game interface only as an intuitive metaphor, because the entropy of the game display is almost independent of the order of what is seen on the screen (see [Pen16, p. 402] for an analogous example of a similar situation. The inspiration behind the idea of the game with entropy not increasing ownership is RTS (Real-Time Strategy) games we play. Exemplary RTS games are Age of Empires.de., Warcraft7, StarCraft8, or the Cossacks9 series, which belonged to the first generation of RTS games. Recent games such as Clash of Clans.de, or the open source game 0 A.D.11 also have great gaming experiences.

At this stage of research, it seems sensible to focus on some MMORTS (massively multiplayer online)."}, {"heading": "1011 0110", "text": "In a typical RTS game, the elements of the game (e.g. buildings, army, town hall and other items) will not be able to be developed from scratch. ESAMU specification proposes to measure the development of these elements in bits. In our view, the user interface of the game to be developed is a different visualization of a corresponding TensorFlow computation graph. Finally, we want to measure the quality (level of development) of these elements in bits. In our view, we want to measure the quality of the source code of the pieces of the source code. First, we focus on developing the entire source code as an execution time. How, for example, can we measure the order of a source code? How can we measure the order of a C or Python source code? There are several classic complexity metrics, for example the cyclomatic complexity [McC76], but only some measurements of the source code codes?"}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "From a purely theoretical point of view, our current work can be seen as a series of preliminary studies on the following questions: What conception of complexity levels do we seek for the gamification of computer graphics? How can we measure the vitality of code? How could the code withstand increasing entropy? The latter two questions have already focused on the approach introduced by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in his famous book [Sch44] on the study of living systems. To apply his ideas in the field of computer science, we find a very interesting challenge18. The thought experiments shown in Figures 3 and 4 contradict our intuitive expectation that programming increases complexity (entropy), so programming in this sense is similar to entropy. 18In the terminology of Turing Machines we already have a similar question in https: / / github.com / nbatfai / algorithmikrofas / tree / manuscript.not increasing behavior of living systems."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The authors would like to thank the students of the BSc course \"High Level Programming Languages\" in the autumn semester 2016 / 2017 at the University of Debrecen and the community members of the group UDPROG19 for their interest and for their tests and their contribution to the ESAMU repository [Ba \ufffd t17b].
