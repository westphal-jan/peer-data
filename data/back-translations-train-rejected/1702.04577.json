While Kleinberg's axioms have been discussed heavily in the past, we concentrate here on the case predominantly relevant for $k$-means algorithm, that is behavior embedded in Euclidean space. We point at some contradictions and counter intuitiveness aspects of this axiomatic set within $\\mathbb{R}^m$ that were evidently not discussed so far. Our results suggest that apparently without defining clearly what kind of clusters we expect we will not be able to construct a valid axiomatic system. In particular we look at the shape and the gaps between the clusters. Finally we demonstrate that there exist several ways to reconcile the formulation of the axioms with their intended meaning and that under this reformulation the axioms stop to be contradictory and the real-world $k$-means algorithm conforms to this axiomatic system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 12:25:28 GMT  (103kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04577v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 06:48:26 GMT  (105kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04577v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["robert k{\\l}opotek", "mieczys{\\l}aw k{\\l}opotek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04577"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.04577.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the Discrepancy Between Kleinberg\u2019s Clustering Axioms and k-Means Clustering Algorithm Behavior", "authors": ["Robert K LOPOTEK"], "emails": ["robert@klopotek.com.pl", "klopotek@ipipan.waw.pl"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index terms - clustering ability, learning ability, Kleinberg axioms, k-meansar Xiv: 170 2.04 577v 2"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "It is a matter of defining a series of concepts which relate to the individual concepts, both the individual concepts and the individual concepts which relate to the individual concepts.

However, we will ask ourselves whether we can move clusters as a whole by increasing the distance between cluster centres rather than overlapping cluster regions which, in the case of k-funds, represent Voronoi regions without leading to an overlap of the convex regions of the cluster regions. Let us focus on the k-means consistency and let us look at two adjacent clusters.

It is known that k-means do not recover from bad initialization under certain circumstances, and as a consequence a natural cluster can be divided even for \"well separated\" data. However, hitting each cluster is not enough as a neighboring cluster to move the cluster center away from its cluster. Hence lets us investigate what kind of well separability would be sufficient to ensure that once clusters are hit by a seed, would never lose the working hypothesis that two clusters are well separated."}, {"heading": "11.2 Core-based clusterings", "text": "But as we have seen in the previous section, the distance between the spheres surrounding clusters will be smaller for various purposes.

If the distance between cluster centers A, B, B amounts to 2B, the radius of a sphere centered in A is g > 0 (g, which is the \"gap\" between clusters), if we select any two points, X from the cluster of A and Y from the cluster of B, then the new clusters will get the spheres centered in A and B of the radius, g / 2 (hereinafter referred to as \"cores\")."}, {"heading": "13 Conclusions and future work", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to go in search of a solution."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank the Institute of Informatics of the Polish Academy of Sciences for the support and funding of this research.

investigates the validity of Kleinberg\u2019s axioms for clustering functions with respect to the quite popular clustering algorithm called k-means.We suggest that the reason why this algorithm does

While Kleinberg\u2019s axioms have been discussed heavily in the past, we concentrate here on the case predominantly relevant for k-means algorithm, that is behavior embedded in Euclidean space. We point at some contradictions and counter intuitiveness aspects of this axiomatic set within R that were evidently not discussed so far. Our results suggest that apparently without defining clearly what kind of clusters we expect we will not be able to construct a valid axiomatic system. In particular we look at the shape and the gaps between the clusters. Finally we demonstrate that there exist several ways to reconcile the formulation of the axioms with their intended meaning and that under this reformulation the axioms stop to be contradictory and the real-world k-means algorithm conforms to this axiomatic system.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
