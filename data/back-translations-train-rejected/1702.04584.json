Developed within the MODEUS project (Making Open Data Effectively Usable), this study originates from the following key ideas of MODEUS: to require Open Data to be expressed in terms of an ontology, and to include such an ontology as a documentation of the data themselves. Thus, Open Data are naturally \u201clinked\u201d by means of the ontology, which meets the requirements of the Linked Open Data vision. The aims are twofold: 1) to contribute to reuse data analyzed and extrapolated, making them machine readable and machine understandable; 2) to provide data access points combining both archival and content descriptions, in order to achieve higher quality and timely return of information. Combining the study of the Catatasto Gregoriano historical and political context, with the investigation of the information content of documents of the fonds, by abstracting and modeling, we came to the proposal of an explicit and formal conceptual model. Using an editor, called Eddy, for the development of ontologies expressed in the Graphol visual language, we realized an OWL ontology specifying an intensional conceptualization (TBox) of the domain of the Catasto Gregoriano. By fully exploiting the expressivty of OWL, the ontology captures the complexity of the domain through three main types of semantic relations: relations between the archival units, relations between elements of the domain described within the documents of the fonds, and, finally, the provenance relationships between those elements and the documents from which their extension can be derived. The development of the extensional level of the ontology (ABox) as well as the querying of the knowledge base obtained by merging the intensional and extensional levels of the ontology, show the potential of an approach that combines contextual information about the archival records with the information contained within such records, integrating and enhancing \u2013 ontologies recently developed within the Cultural Heritage domain, and in particular, within the Archival", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
