Introduction", "text": "Considering an undirected graph G, a dominant group D is a subset of wells such that each vertex is not in D to at least one member of D. The Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem is to identify the smallest approximation problem within a diagram showing the total weight of wells in it.The MWDS problem has played a prominent role in various real-world domains, such as social networks, communications networks and industrial applications. For example, Houmaidi et al. are making the first known attempt to solve the sparse wavelength problem, where the MWDS problem is used to reduce the number of full wavelength converters in the wavelength division."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "An undirected graph G = (V, E) includes a node set V = {v1, v2,..., vn} of n nodes along with a set E = {e1, e2,..., em} of m edges, where each edge e = {v, u} connects two nodes u and v, and these two nodes are called edge endpoints. The distance between two nodes u and v, denoted by dist (u, v), is the number of edges in a shortest path from u to v, and dist (u, u) = 0 in particular. For a node v, we define its ith-plane neighborhood as Ni (v) = {u | dist (u, v) = i}, and we denote Nk (v) = k (v) = 1Ni (v). The first level neighborhood N1 (v) is commonly referred to as N (v), and we denote a problem Ni [v] = Ni (v) as a problem that includes v (v)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Local Search for MWDS", "text": "Local search algorithms perform the search on the corresponding search space of the problem; the search space is implicitly defined by the way the algorithm transforms one candidate solution into another. In the MWDS problem, local search algorithms usually maintain a candidate solution S V during the search. A vertex v is covered by S when v N [S], and is otherwise uncovered. Also, the state of a vertex v is denoted by sv {1, 0}, so that sv = 1 means that a vertex v is covered by a candidate solution S, and sv = 0 means that it is uncovered. For a vertex, its age is defined as the number of steps it has taken since the last time it changed its state (added or removed w.r.t. the retained candidate solution S), and when we say that the oldest vertex is covered by a candidate solution S, and sv = it is revealed."}, {"heading": "2.2 Configuration Checking", "text": "ieD eenlrteeSrteee\u00fcgr rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide eeisrcnlhtee\u00fccnlhSrtee\u00fccnlhsrtee\u00fccnlhsrteee\u00fccnlhsrf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide nlrgne\u00fceaeaeFnlhc ni rde eeirlrrrrrrrteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"}, {"heading": "3.

Intuitively, when a vertex is normally revealed, we should encourage the algorithm to select a vertex to make it covered. Specifically, each vertex has an additional property, frequency, which is indicated by Freq [v]. The frequency of each vertex is initialized to 1. After each iteration of the local search, the frequency value of each vertex uncovered is increased by one. During the search process, we apply the frequency of the vertex to decide which vertex to add or remove. Based on this consideration, we propose a new score function, which is formally defined as a folding point.

Among the previous algorithms, R-PBIG and ACO-PP-LS show better solutions than HGA, ABC and EA / G-IR in most cases, with only a few exceptions. For our algorithm, we show the minimum solution value and runtime. As shown in Table 1, CC2FS has a clear superiority over the T1 benchmark, with the exception of v50e750. If we compare these algorithms, we can easily conclude that CC2FS outperforms other algorithms. The experimental results for the T2 benchmark are shown in Table 2. The quality of the solutions found by CC2FS is always much lower than those found by other algorithms in all cases with 2 exceptions, i.e. v250e250 and v800e10000."}, {"heading": "7.2 Results on UDG Benchmark", "text": "Table 3 shows the comparison results to the UDG benchmark. In these cases, the solution value obtained by EA / G-IR and ACO-PP-LS is almost equivalent to CC2FS, the expert for one instance V1000U150. But the real runtime of all instances solved by CC2FS is always less than 0.2 seconds, and CC2FS solves faster than EA / G-IR and ACO-PP-LS. Seen from Table 1, 2 and 3, our algorithm takes less time to obtain better values, while the runtime of ACO-PP-LS grows rapidly with increasing number of vertices. Especially for larger diagrams such as v1000e1000 and V1000U200, the runtime of our algorithm is two orders of magnitude less than that of ACO-PP-LS."}, {"heading": "7.3 Results on BHOSLIB Benchmarks", "text": "In Tables 4 and 5, CC2FS is compared with ACO-PP-LS using the two weighted BHOSLIB benchmarks, with one assuming the weighting function w (vi) = (i mod 200) + 1 (Table 4), while the other assuming the weighting function w (vi) = 1 (Table 5). We compare the number of optimal solutions found by the two algorithms. CC2FS once again dramatically outperforms its competitors ACO-PP-LS. Any cases of this benchmark could be solved faster by our algorithm than ACO-PP-LS. More importantly, our algorithm could find better solution values."}, {"heading": "7.4 Results on DIMACS Benchmarks", "text": "The experimental results of the two weighted DIMACS benchmarks are shown in Tables 6 and 7. It is encouraging to see that the performance of CC2FS remains surprisingly good in these cases, where ACO-PP-LS performs very poorly. Despite the performance advantage of CC2FS, there are some exceptions in the weighting function of w (vi) = (i mod 200) + 1, such as gen200 _ p0.9 _ 44 and C500.9. For the weighting function w (vi) = 1, our algorithms in Table 7 show a significant improvement in real-time and the best solution value than ACO-PP-LS.

The pseudo-code of CC2FS + BREAK is introduced in Algorithm 3.

Summary and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, a local search algorithm called CC2FS was introduced to solve the problem of minimum weight dominating set (MWDS). We proposed a new configuration verification strategy, namely CC2based on the two-tiered neighborhood of vertices, in order to remember the relevant information of remote and added vertices and avoid visiting the most recent paths. In addition, we introduced a new frequency-based scoring feature to solve MWDS. Experimental results showed that CC2FS performs significantly better than state-of-the-art algorithms in almost all cases in terms of solution quality and runtime. In terms of future work, we are considering further improving the CC2FS algorithm by integrating some other ideas such as strong configuration testing (Wang et al., 2016). Also, we would like to test our algorithms on other instances, including larger diagrams. Among the planned research guidelines on the proposed search strategies are some other important application of the new search algorithms to local scalgorithms, and some of the other algorithms on the new algorithms proposed."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Shaowei Cai is also supported by the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The second idea is a novel scoring function based on the frequency of being uncovered of vertices. Our algorithm is called CCFS, according to the names of the two ideas.
