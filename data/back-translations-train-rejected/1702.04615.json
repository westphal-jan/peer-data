When the heart can't pump enough blood to efficiently deliver nutrients and oxygen to the body, kidney function may be impaired, resulting in fluid retention. CHF patients require a broad drug regimen to maintain the delicate system balance, particularly between their heart and kidneys. These drugs include ACE inhibitors and Beta Blockers to control blood pressure, anticoagulants to prevent blood clots, and diuretics to reduce fluid overload. Many of these drugs may interact, and potential effects of these interactions must be weighed against their benefits. For this project, we consider a set of 44 drugs identified as specifically relevant for treating CHF by pediatric cardiologists at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. This list was generated as part of our current work at the LPCH Heart Center. The goal of this project is to identify and evaluate potentially harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs) within pediatric patients with Congestive Heart Failure. This identification will be done autonomously, so that it may continuously update by evaluating newly published literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 11 Feb 2017 02:21:42 GMT  (1031kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04615v1", "Final project report for CS 221: Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2016 at Stanford University"]], "COMMENTS": "Final project report for CS 221: Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2016 at Stanford University", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["daniel miller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04615"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.04615.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Automated Identification of Drug-Drug Interactions in Pediatric Congestive Heart Failure Patients", "authors": ["Daniel Miller"], "emails": ["danielrm@stanford.edu,"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Automatically identifying drug-drug interactions in childhood heart failure patients is a major medical issue that can lead to fluid retention in the body due to a weak heart.

GOALS AND DATA", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Automated Literature Analysis", "text": "In the first phase, I will use natural language processing to extract drug interactions from the abstracts of medical research papers. Input to this phase will be raw abstract texts relating to a DDI, such as the one in Figure 1. As the first evaluation metric (labels), I have used DrugBank, an established resource for drug data that includes drug interaction with drugs and much more. DrugBank has been assembled over several years by a team of archivists and commentators, which included two accredited pharmacists, a physician and three bioinformatics specialists with dual training in informatics and molecular biology / chemistry. One goal of my project is to design an automated system capable of replicating and expanding the DDI component of this work. All the abstracts used in this project are from the PubMed Central Open Access Subset November 2016 [3]. All of these data are currently available in 66xml format and 5p."}, {"heading": "B. Patient Analysis", "text": "The second goal of my project is to use the results of the previous phase to identify potential drug interactions for a sample of patients with heart failure, based on the results of the previous phase. For this project, I am using an anonymized extract from the Full Medical Administration Record (MAR) for 60 current and former CHF patients at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH). Specific inputs to this phase are: 1) The interactions generated by the previous phase 2 overlap and create time frames in which the patient could experience harmful DDI effects (drug name and admin time).The outcome of this phase is a set of positive patient data on furosemide and bumetanide administration data in Figure 2. As we can see from Figure 2, this drug administration is overlapping, creating time frames in which the patient could experience harmful DDI effects."}, {"heading": "III. MODEL", "text": "At the moment we are only looking at Part A, the automated literature analysis. The general use case of the proposed model can be summarised as follows: 1) The user asks a question in the following form: \"Do drugs A and B have potentially harmful interactions, and if so, how can they interact?\" 2) A large number of medical publications are provided, each of which is related to either drug A, B or both. 3) Our model is based on these inputs and provides the interactions between drugs, if any. To create a model that meets this form, we perform the following steps."}, {"heading": "A. Labeling", "text": "Let's start by looking at the 44 pairwise drug combinations Dcardiac. For each heart drug dc, Dcardiac we extract all pairwise drug interactions (dc, d) from the DrugBank database Dcardiac. The union of all considered drugs d constitutes the set of all drugs Dall considered in this analysis. For each heart drug dc, Dcardiac we create a sample for each other drug in do, Dall. We assign an indicator label when two drugs interact as follows: Label ((dc, do) = {1 if (dc, do) \u2022 Ddrugbank 0 or therwise This label is used for the binary classification supervised learning problem where we predict whether two drugs interact but not the type of their interaction. We also consider the type of interaction that is also provided by the DrugBank. We obtain the inypse name of each drug in the interaction 53 that we can replace in each of the two drug combinations."}, {"heading": "B. Test/Train/Validation Split", "text": "For this particular problem, it is worth defining the validation splits particularly carefully. As each abstraction can take into account one or more drugs (see Table I), we would like to use the information of each abstraction for more than one interaction (sample). Therefore, our samples are not independent, so a randomly sampled validation set may be highly correlated with the training set. We therefore take precautions to eliminate this dependence by dividing the interactions by the following method: Algorithm 1 Pull / Test / Validation Split Algorithm 1: Split all abstracts in training (80%) and Tests (20%) sets. 2: Split all interactions in training (80%) and Tests (20%) sets. 3: Split Training in Training (80%) and Validation Split Algorithm 1: Split all abstracts in training (80%) and Tests (20%) sets 4: Split Training in Training (20%) and Validation in Training (80%)."}, {"heading": "C. Feature Extraction", "text": "We first extract characteristics for each DDI from the abstracts. So far, we have two methods for performing feature extraction1) Word Counts: Right now, we simply use a sparse vector word counter for each assigned abstraction and add up over all abstract counters to obtain a single feature vector for each interaction. Let's refer to Table I for summary information on the number of words in the abstractions. The current model is rooted in scaling. Many abstractions are hundreds of words long, and mention dozens of drugs. Our last sparse word counters consider 53338 words over 63450 interaction samples. To run some methods, it was necessary to drop all but the most common words to allow a reasonable runtime."}, {"heading": "D. Supervised Learning: Evaluation and Model Selection", "text": "So far, I have implemented a variety of different monitored learning algorithms. Each model is trained exclusively on the basis of training splitting, and all model tuning is done by dividing the training into further validation sets and cross-validation folds. This final model is based on the validation / dev set. This final model is re-tuned to the combined train / validation sets, and only then are the final performance metrics evaluated on the test bench. The first model that was considered was a linear SVM with the word counting features, convenient scalability, and consideration of cheap feature enhancements via the core methods. I implemented this model with the e1071 package in R, as it supports sparse predictor matrices."}, {"heading": "IV. FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The preliminary methods and results presented in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of the objectives of this project. In particular, the lasso word-counting method indicates the use of feature selection in conjunction with a broad, automatically generated feature space. The primary limitation of the project so far has been scalability. Fortunately, these problems are focused on highly parallelisable algorithms and can be addressed in the future through GPU implementation. Likewise, more efficient implementations will allow more complex NLP algorithms to perform feature extractions from the summaries associated with each drug interaction. In summary, our results indicate that there is useful information on drug-heart failure patients interactions that can be autonomously extracted from the medical literature without external clinical knowledge."}], "references": [{"title": "Bumetanide and furosemide in heart failure", "author": ["D.C.
