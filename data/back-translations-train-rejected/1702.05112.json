This system consists of the following components: - Mocassin, an ontology of structural elements of mathematical scientific work; - OntoMathPRO, an ontology of mathematical knowledge concepts; - Semantic publishing platform; - Semantic formula search; - Recommendation system.Briefly, we describe these basic elements of the architecture of the digital ecosystem OntoMath (fig. 2).The core component of the OntoMath ecosystem is its semantic publishing platform. It forms a LOD representation for a collection of mathematical articles in LATEX. The generated mathematical dataset includes metadata, the logical structure of documents, terminology and mathematical formulas. Article metadata, the logical structure of documents and terminology are used in terms of AKT Portal, Mocassin and PRO systems."}, {"heading": "4.2 Semantic Publishing Platform", "text": "As mentioned above, the semantic publication platform, which forms the core of the OntoMath ecosystem, forms a LOD representation for a given sample of mathematical articles in LATEX [63], [64]. Its main features are: - Indexing mathematical articles in LATEX format as LOD-compatible RDFdata; - Extracting the metadata of articles in the sense of AKT portal ontology [65]; - Considering the logical structure of the document using our ontology of structural elements of mathematical essays; - Creating instances of mathematical units such as the concepts of OntoMathPROontology; - Linking the extracted text instances with symbolic expressions and for-mulas in mathematical notation; - Determining the relationship between published data and existing RDF sets of mathematical formulas formulas MaD formulas. The developed technology has the following features: - Combining mathematics RDF theorem based on a mathematical collection of results in a DRO; - Combining mathematical knowledge in the RDF; - Combining the RDF in the Russian Rules."}, {"heading": "4.3 Ontologies", "text": "Mocassin [67] is an ontology that aims to comment on a logical structure of a mathematical document [63], [68]. This ontology extends the SALT Document Ontology by defining concepts and relationships specific to mathematical documents. Mocassin Ontology represents a mathematical document as a series of interconnected segments. Mocassin Ontology defines 15 terms such as document segment, claim, definition, statement, example, axiom, theorem, lemma, proof, equation and others. Ontology defines relationships between segments such as dependencies, such as dependencyOn, exemplary, hasSegment, Reference To.OntoMathPRO [70] is an ontology of mathematical knowledge [12], [71], [72].Its concepts are organized into two taxonomies: - Hierarchy of areas of mathematics: logic, set theory, geometry, and geometry."}, {"heading": "4.4 Applications", "text": "OntoMath Formula Search Engine is a semantic search service that uses a semantic representation of mathematical documents based on the Semantic Publishing Platform [64], [71]. OntoMath Formula Search Engine implements a new search for variable names using OntoMath ontology. A variable in the formula is a symbol that denotes a mathematical object. Mathematical symbols can denote numbers (constants), variables, operations, functions, punctuation, grouping and other aspects of logical syntax. Specific branches and applications of mathematics usually have specific naming conventions for variables. However, non-standard names of variables can be used in some formulas. OntoMath Formula Search Engine allows to search for a given mathematical object regardless of its name for the variable."}, {"heading": "4.5 OntoMath Recommender System", "text": "As an application of the OntoMath ecosystem, we have developed a recommendation system for collections of physical and mathematical documents. One of the main functions of this system is the creation of a list of related documents (see [76] - [78]). Traditionally, the list of related documents is based on the keywords indicated by the authors as well as on the bibliographic references available in the documents. This approach has several disadvantages: - A list of keywords may be missing or incomplete; - A keyword may be ambiguous; - It is necessary to take into account the hierarchy of concepts; - It should be noted that the article can use terminology in different languages. Thus, the created recommendation system has the following characteristics: - It takes into account the professional profile of a particular user; - It makes different recommendations for different scenarios of working with this system (arbitrator, user introduced to the topic, etc.); - It therefore indicates for scientific review areas where mathematical work is of greater importance than such work begins in mathematical work."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "The basic ideas, approaches and results of the development of the discussed technology of mathematical knowledge management are based on specific ontologies in the field of mathematics. These solutions form the basis of the specialized digital ecosystem OntoMath, which consists of ontologies, text analysis tools and applications for the administration of mathematical knowledge. Studies are in line with the project for the creation of a digital world library, the aim of which is to design a distributed system of networked repositories of digitized versions of mathematical documents. The future of the OntoMath ecosystem depends on the development of new services for semantic text analysis and control of mathematical knowledge. The developed technologies will be evaluated with the help of the digital mathematical collections of the Federal University of Kazan.The present work aims at further research in the field of mathematical knowledge management, which has been carried out by the authors of the paper with the support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, the Federal University of Kazan and the Academy of Sciences of the Tatarstan since 1998."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work was financed by a grant awarded to the Federal University of Kazan for a state contract in the field of scientific activities (Funding Agreement No. 1.2368 / 2017)."}], "references": [{"title": "The TEX book", "author": ["D.E.
