Of course, the quality of the approximation dictates convergence, but we delay this discussion to Section 5.The following theorem states convergence of ADF-SYMVOL; it assumes that HSAMPLE and DECAMPLE will only be applied."}, {"heading": "5. Implementation and Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we present a case study on the bias of decision-making programs.

We implement our algorithms in a tool called FairSquare and evaluate its ability to prove or refute the property for a selection of programs. In addition, we evaluate the impact of various parameters on implementation performance and compare the applicability of FairSquare with other probable conclusions."}, {"heading": "5.1 Implementation", "text": "We have implemented our presented algorithms in a new tool called FairSquare, which uses Z3 [35] for the SMT solution and Redlog [4] for quantifier elimination. To calculate group justice, we break down conditional probabilities into four common probabilities: Pr [P (v), min (v), qual (v), Pr [P (v), qual (v), qual (v), qual (v), qual (v) and qual (v). FairSquare calculates lower limits for eight quantities: the weighted volume of each of these probabilities and also their negations, since a lower limit for negation provides an upper limit for the positive form. A round of sampling involves (i) qual (v) obtaining a sample (hyperrectangle) for each of these eight quantities, (ii) calculating the weighted volumes of these samples, (ii) updating the group justice, verifying the quantity and verifying the quantity."}, {"heading": "5.2 Benchmarks", "text": "We trained a variety of machine learning models using a popular income dataset [1] used in related research on algorithmic fairness [22, 41, 72] to predict whether a person has a low or high income; suppose these programs were used to determine a new employee's salary: high (> $50,000) or low. We would like to verify whether salary decisions are fair to qualified female employees. Using the Weka Machine Learning Suite [5], we learned 11 different decision programs (see Bischoff's textbook [20] for background) listed in Figure 9: - Four decision trees named DTn, where n is the number of conditionalities in the program. The number of variables and depth of the tree each variable from 2 to 3. - Four supporting vector machines with linear cores, called SVMn, where n is the number of variables in the linear dividing line."}, {"heading": "5.3 Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we discuss FairSquare's ability to verify qualified group justice or injustice for 39 problems, as summarized in Figure 9. In these problems, min (v) = true if the applicant is female, and qual (v) = true in two different scenarios: First, we consider the case if torment is tautologically true, and second, if the applicant is at least 18 years old. Figure 9 shows only the first case, because while the numbers for the two cases are different, the qualitative results are quite similar. See Appendix D for the full table of results. We fix = 0.15. To guide the volume calculation, all Gaussian distributions are comprised of mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c32 ADFs with 5 equal steps (\u00b5 \u2212 3\u03c32, \u00b5 + 3\u03c32) - analogous to Figure 7 (a). FairSquare was able to solve 32 of the 39 problems, which proves 21 and 11, as shown in the left-hand figure."}, {"heading": "5.4 Comparison to other tools", "text": "We have applied our benchmarks to the other two exact probabilistic inference tools that accept the same class of problems, and report these results in the right-hand bar chart in Figure 9. First, we compare with the tool of Sankaranarayanan et al. [66] (VC), which is algorithmically similar to our tool 13 2017 / 3 / 8: It finds limits to probabilities on individual paths by approaching formulas with limiting and inscribed hyperrectangles. Second, we compare with PSI [44], which symbolically calculates representations of the rear distributions of variables. If closed form solutions for CDFs exist, PSI is of great help because these solutions can be evaluated to obtain exact probability values immediately; however, the graph shows that our benchmarks are often too complex, resulting in integrals that do not have closed forms, or problems that PSI cannot resolve within the timeout periods."}, {"heading": "5.5 Effect of Parameters", "text": "We are now examining the effects of approximate density functions (see Section 4.2) and sample maximization optimizations. These results are shown in Figures 10 and 11. There are three examples of ADFs in Figure 10 that are used to guide the sample in regions with high probability: (i) none indicates that no ADF is used, i.e. we have used SYMVOL instead of ADF-SYMVOL; (ii) uniformly indicates that each sample (\u00b5, \u03c32) is approximated by a uniform function covering a certain volume (\u00b5 \u2212 3\u03c32, \u00b5 + 3\u03c32) (similar to Figure 7 (c); and (iii) 5-step indicates that each Gaussian sample is approximated by a step function of 5 equally wide regions covering the same domain (similar to Figure 7 (a)."}, {"heading": "6. Related Work", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "A. Operational Semantics", "text": "Operational semantics We now define the operational semantics of P as shown in Figure 12. Typically, the state s: V \u2192 R of the program is defined as the evaluation function of variables in V to values in R. However, in a probabilistic environment, we must maintain an additional state dictating values drawn from probability distributions. Following the standard semantics of probabilistic programs [52], we assume a finite sequence of independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables. Therefore, the semantics of an execution is defined for a fixed sequence of values of these variables. Informally, it is as if we had performed all samples before the program executed the results and stored them in a sequence to use whenever we encounter a probabilistic mapping. To simplify interpretation, we assume that all probabilistic assignments originate from the same distribution; otherwise, multiple sequences can be used per distribution."}, {"heading": "B.
