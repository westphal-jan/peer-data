Existing MAPF methods are used, for example, to achieve reductions in satisfaction problems, integer linear programming or response to programming [Yu and LaValle, 2013b et al., 2013; Surynek, 2015] or to use suboptimal search methods [Silver, 2005; Sturtevant and Buro, 2006; Wang and Botea, 2008; Standley, 2010; Standley and Korf, 2011; Wang and Botea, 2011; Luna and Bekris, 2011; Sharon et al., 2013; Barer et al."}, {"heading": "2 Combined Target Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) for Teams of Agents", "text": "Each agent in a team must be assigned a target, which is assigned to his team, so that agents \"paths from their current wells to their destination optimize a cost function. For example, in a Kiva warehouse system, the drive units that move warehouse pods from inventory stations to warehouses are grouped into one team, because each of them must be assigned an available warehouse location. Previous MAPF methods assumed that each agent was assigned a target in advance through some targeting procedures, but to achieve optimum results, we have formulated TAPF, which links goal assignment and path finding problems and defines a common goal for both. In TAPF, agents are divided into teams. Each team receives the same number of unique targets as there are agents in the team. TAPF's job is to assign goals to agents and plan conflict-free paths for agents."}, {"heading": "3 Package-Exchange Robot Routing (PERR) and New Complexity Results for MAPF", "text": "In fact, most people are able to move to another world, in which they are able to move, in which they are able to move, and in which they see themselves able to move."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Maxim Likhachev and Michael Phillips for helpful discussions and Ariel Felner, Guni Sharon and Maxim Barer for the CBS and ECBS (w) source code we used in our experiments, which were supported by NSF grant numbers 1409987 and 1319966."}, {"heading": "4 Exploitation of Problem Structure and Predictability of Motions", "text": "Agents share their workspaces with people, and the consistency of their movements and the resulting predictability of their movements are important for the safety of people, which is not taken into account by the existing MAPF methods. This motivates us to exploit the problem structure of the given MAPF cases and to design a scheme that encourages agents to move along the edges provided by the user (so-called highways) [Cohen et al., 2015]. We use motorways in the context of a simple inflation scheme based on the ideas of experience charts [Phillips et al., 2012] to derive new heuristic values that encourage the MAPF methods to travel paths that include the edges of the motorways, avoiding head-to-head collisions between the agents and achieving consistency and predictability of their movements. Thus, for example, in a warehouse system in Kiva, we can design high values that cover the narrow passages between the 2 locations as shown in the images."}, {"heading": "5 Dealing with Imperfect Plan-Execution Capabilities", "text": "State-of-the-art MAPF or TAPF systems can find collision-free paths for hundreds of agents optimally or with user-provided sub-optimum guarantees in reasonable computational time, even in crowded and confined environments, such as Kiva warehousing systems. However, agents often have imperfect plan execution capabilities and are unable to perfectly synchronize their movements, which can lead to frequent and time-consuming rescheduling. Therefore, we have proposed a framework that makes efficient the use of a simple time network to topostat an MAPF solution to create a plan execution plan that works for non-holonomic robots, takes into account their maximum translation and rotation speeds, provides a guaranteed safety distance between them, and exploits gap (defined as the difference between the latest and earliest site entry times) to absorb imperfect plan execution and, in many cases, avoid Umplantic Umplantations in addition to the robotic [APF was applied in 2016]."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We discussed four areas of research that address problems that arise when generalizing MAPF methods to real-world scenarios and exploiting either the problem structure or existing MAPF methods.
