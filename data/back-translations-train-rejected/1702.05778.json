Drivers must have a strategy to return home from different exit ramps that have different payout possibilities. The absent-minded driver has no memory and this represents a specific case of the problem concerning the choice between actions with state-dependent payouts. [3] Since the decisions made at different intersections do not depend on the previous one (due to the absence of the driver), this problem belongs to the class of decision-making with incomplete information and it has implications for the general area of rational agency, learning, the social choice of mechanism design, the auction theories of knowledge and belief. It is also of importance in such extensions of classical decision theory that involve quantum processes. Piccione and Rubenstein (PR) thought the situation will be slightly different to that of arriving at an intersection."}, {"heading": "THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM", "text": "In order to get there, he must take the motorway, on which the first exit (A; withdrawal 0) is dangerous and must be avoided. The second exit (B; withdrawal 4) is at home. If he misses both exits, he will have to reach the end of the motorway and spend the night in a hotel (withdrawal 1). If he always gets off at A, his withdrawal is 0 and if he always gets off at B, it is 4. Since the driver does not know at which intersection he is (withdrawal 1). Since the driver does not know at which junction he is at, PR [2] assumed that he should apply a consistent strategy whereby the probability of his exit is B, in the case of withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal at the withdrawal."}, {"heading": "UNKNOWN PAYOFFS WITH ONE ITEM OF MEMORY", "text": "It is assumed that the driver knows how many exits there are and that their number will be k (which is 4 for example 2). This number was recognized as good at the planning stage in the previous case. We would expect that any consistently applied decision-making strategy will perform worse than the previous case. If not, it would mean that the lack of knowledge about the individual payouts was compensated by the assumed additional capacity to track the number of exits. From a Bayesian perspective, the best performance will be achieved in the event of unknown payouts if each of them is reached with the same probability. Suppose that the driver adopts the strategy of reaching each exit with the same probability. This is equivalent to the following algorithm: The probabilities associated with the exits on the fly."}, {"heading": "First choice A.", "text": "Payout 0.
