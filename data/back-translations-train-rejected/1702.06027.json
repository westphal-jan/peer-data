Assuming that language offers an evolutionary advantage, some evolutionary models are proposed [1, 11-18], some of which are game theory [19]. Information theory approaches predict that not only symbols, but word formation is necessary to have efficient communication that leads to basic grammatical rules [12, 15]. There are also empirical approaches to language development [4, 5, 20]. It is believed that language develops within a generation and is transmitted from generation to generation. One of the critical questions, which includes rich discussions of universal grammars, is how language can be learned by the new generation [1-5]."}, {"heading": "Motivation", "text": "In this study, we are using and expanding the mathematical framework that is already established [12, 13, 24]. Our expansion leads us to the emergence of diversity in language. Language diversity is indeed very popular; it is even addressed in the well-known history of the Tower of Babel. According to history, people who speak the same language once around the world are such that they no longer understand each other. It is expected that a child can learn language from its neighbors in society. Neighborhood encompasses their parents, their kinship network, territoriality and work roles [16]. Ref [13] considers language as a culturally transferable entity, in which cultural transmission is defined as a type of transmission in which socially acquired information is passed on, in the form of teaching. Three types of neighborhoods in which the child learns a language are studied. (i) In parental education, which is produced asexemplarily, we learn from their parents."}, {"heading": "BACKGROUND", "text": "We check the language model developed by Ref [12, 13, 24] with slightly modified notation. Then we go through the k-means clustering algorithm [25-27]. Finally, we adapt k-means to the language domain and use it to identify language subcommunities."}, {"heading": "Language Model", "text": "We model speech communication in a very simple way, called proto-language, as follows: Let P be the set of N agents. An agent thinks of a meaning \u00b5 and wants to pass it on to Agent j. Since she has no means to pass a meaning in her mind directly to the mind of j, she must use signals. She selects a signal x, which she thinks is a representation of \u00b5, and passes the signal on to j. We assume that there is no loud channel, that is, you get exactly what is sent. Receiving x, J tries to interpret x in his own way. Hopefully j interprets it as \u00b5. Clearly, mappings from \u00b5 to x at i and from x back to \u00b5 at j are very important for successful communication. We must specify how the association of meaning and signal is carried out when sending and receiving endings. Let's assume that each agent has his own statistics a\u00b5x, how often he uses the signal x to signify."}, {"heading": "Comprehension", "text": "Suppose agent i wants to pass on the meaning \u00b5 to agent j.The probability of doing this correctly is S \u2211 x = 1e (i) \u00b5xd (j) x\u00b53, where e (i) \u00b5x and d (j) x\u00b5 are respectively the encoding of i and the decoding of j. If we grasp this across all meanings, we get understanding from i to j, which is F (i \u2192 j) = 1MM \u2211 \u00b5 = 1S \u2211 x = 1e (i) \u00b5xd (j) x\u00b5. If we want them to communicate in both directions, we consider mutual understanding F (i \u00b2 j) = F (i \u00b2 j) + F (j \u2192 i) 2. Let us now consider understanding within a community C'P. Within a community, understanding is defined as the average understanding in a community."}, {"heading": "Learning Model", "text": "The development of language can take place in two different ways. Language develops both through agents who interact with each other within one generation, and through learning from one generation to the next. We follow the latter form, as given in Ref [13]. In each generation, the population is replaced by new N-agents. Agents of the new generation initially have no meaning-signal associations, that is, the association matrices of the agents are empty. In order for the language to be transmitted from the generation of parents to the generation of children, some agents are selected as teachers. In Ref [13], teacher selection is a result of fitness gains. the fitness of an agent is directly related to its ability to communicate with the entire population."}, {"heading": "Finding Optimum Language Clusters", "text": "We adapt k-means to the language domain. In this adaptation, k-means provides K-communities in such a way that agents in the same community better understand each other. \u03b2-metric is mutual understanding and the goal is to maximize understanding within the community through communities. Our approach involves two steps: First, we find the best partition for a particular K, then we find the best K for our purpose. Let PK = {C1, C2, \u00b7 \u00b7, CK} be some partitions of Agent P with K-clusters. We consider clusters as language communities. The average within the understanding within the community is defined asW (PK) = 1KK \u00b2 = 1W (C\u03b1).There are many partitions of P with K-clusters. For a givenK-means algorithm, Partition PK offers which is expected to be close to the partition with the maximum average within the understanding. This is PK = max K (unfortunately, there is no optimum PK algorithm)."}, {"heading": "MODEL", "text": "We propose an evolutionary model in which each generation has N agents. < The system begins with the first generation > R agents, whose association matrices are randomly filled in. Remaining generations fill their association matrices through learning. Each agent i makes exactly one child i-t. The association matrix of a child is initially empty. Each child learns his language from his teacher, who is designated ti. The teacher provides Q samples for each meaning and the child fills his association matrix on the basis of these samples. Note that there is only one teacher for a child. How to select a teacher in the generation of the patent is what we are focusing on now. We use different methods to select the teacher and examine their impact on the language."}, {"heading": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "We study the effects of different selection strategies on the global language. We compare our results with the understanding of the role model of [13], which we call the base model. In the base model, parent has no influence on teacher selection. < The teacher is chosen proportionally to the general fitness of the agent by the entire population. In Figure 1, we share the simulation results, where the overall understanding W (P) is a function of the relative size of the sample size Q = 4, 6 that is, r = R / N. Since it is independent of r, the base model is represented in our numbers as a straight line. There are N agents who use S = 15 signals to communicate M = 8 meanings with the sample size Q = 4. We have results of N = 50, 100, 150 and 200, but we report only N = 100 in Figure 1. Each data point is an average result of 100 realizations with corresponding r-values. We run each realization over 500 generations. This number is sufficient, as even 100 simulations do not converge rapidly in a state W in a generation."}, {"heading": "Subcommunities", "text": "Poor performance of models A and B raises the question why selection strategies that take into account either linguistic or spatial proximity to parents do not provide a medium for the emergence of global language. A possible explanation could be that instead of single languages used by the entire population, many languages are created that are used by the subcommunities. We have tested the above hypotheses within the common understanding and used an economic means algorithm to see if such language subcommunities exist. On the same data presented in Fig. 1, we apply the k-means algorithm to obtain subcommunities within the common understanding of W-economy of subcommunities. Figure 2a low W-value indicates that we could not find a suitable subcommunity economy structure, whereas W-economy is high that there is such a cluster formation that representatives of the same subcommunity understand each other quite well. With the first point of common economy, we indicate that all values of the model W-economy-minimum economy are above the minimum level of the economy-economy-economy."}, {"heading": "Number of Subcommunities", "text": "We will now focus on the number of subcommunities. As we mentioned in the discussion on k > mean values, in order to find the optimal cluster number, one must try to find different K values. For N = 100, the maximum possible value for K is 100. We arbitrarily choose K = 10 as the maximum value. So we have tried to determine K = 1, 2,.., 10 and the reported optimal K value in Fig. 2c. The curve in Fig. 2c starts at 9 and decreases as r increases to 1. A decrease to 1 is to be expected because if r is large enough, the system converges into a single global language, as shown in Fig. 1.8 r 10-2 10-2 10-1 100 \u00a1K > 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 Model-A (N = 50) Model-B (N = 50) Model-B (N = 100) Model-B (N = 150) Model-A (N = 200) Model-B."}, {"heading": "Future Work", "text": "The models we use cover only a very basic form of the process and are far from analysing many complex details of the language. Various supplements could be added to the model.First, we assume that each person learns their language from a teacher in a very specific way. In Ref. [13], various types of learning processes have been reported. Thus, for example, the evolution of language can be perceived as a cultural process in which a group of people is responsible for the transfer [12]. This means that each child could be assigned more than one teacher. (i) If the data set and the given value of K are taken into account, teachers can be considered not only from the parent generation, but also from the grandparent generation [29]. Although k means are a widespread heuristic, we may need much more specific form of community recognition algorithms. (i) If the data set and the given value of K are incompatible, we do not expect the clusters to function symmetrically."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this study, we examine two real-life conditions in the K's clusters.

evolutionary model for emergence of diversity in language is developed. We investigated the effects of two real life observations, namely, people prefer people that they communicate with well, and people interact with people that are physically close to each other. Clearly these groups are relatively small compared to the entire population. We restrict selection of the teachers from such small groups, called imitation sets, around parents. Then the child learns language from a teacher selected within the imitation set of her parent. As a result, there are subcommunities with their own languages developed. Within subcommunity comprehension is found to be high. The number of languages is related to the relative size of imitation set by a power law.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
