Our experience in introductory programming courses is that students learning programming for the first time often struggle to solve programming problems for themselves. Manually providing instructions simply does not scale for the ever-increasing number of students. To make matters worse, even teachers sometimes make mistakes and shy students are reluctant to ask questions. Motivated by this experience, we strive to build an automatic system that helps students improve their skills without human teachers. In this paper, we present a key component of the system that automatically generates complete programs from incomplete programs. Entries from the algorithm are a subprogram with limitations on variables and constants that specify the behavior of the program."}, {"heading": "2 Showcase", "text": "In this section, we present SIMPL with four programming problems that most beginners find difficult; < r = > r = > r To use SIMPL, students must provide (1) a subprogram, (2) a set of input-output examples, and (3) resources that SIMPL can use. Resources consist of a set of integer variables and a set of array variables. SIMPL's goal is to complete the subprogram. r.t. The input-output-output examples that use only the given resources.

Let us consider a synthesis problem ((x, c, y), E, \u0442, Xi, Xa). The corresponding search problem is defined by the transition system (S, \u2192, s0, F), where S is a series of states, (\u2192) S \u00b7 S is a transition relationship, s0, S is a starting state and F S is a series of solution states.

The algorithm initializes the workset W with c0 (line 1), then selects a state s with the smallest size and removes the state from the workset (line 3). If the pruning fails, the next states of s are included in the workset and the loop repeats. Details of our pruning technique are described in Section 4.3. At the moment, the algorithm assumes that pruning always fails. The basic algorithm implicitly performs two well-known optimization techniques. First, it maintains previously researched states and never looks at them again. Second, it normalizes states so that semantically equivalent programs are also synchronously the same expressions."}, {"heading": "4.3 Pruning with Static Analysis", "text": "Static analysis allows us to identify states that are ultimately not a solution. We first define the concept of failure. (Definition 1) A state is a failure state that is called a failure state. (Definition 1) Our goal is to detect as many failure states as possible. We observed two typical cases of failure states that often show up during the search for an algorithm. (Example 1) Consider the program in Figure 4 (a) and the input output example (1). If the program is executed with n = 1, it does not matter how the hole is executed, the output value r is no less than 2 in the return statement."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation", "text": "Experimental Setup To evaluate our synthesis algorithm, we have compiled 30 introductory problems from several online forums (Table 1).2 The problems consist of integer and array manipulation tasks. Some problems are not trivial for beginners; they require students to come up with different control structures such as nested loops and combinations of loops and conditional statements; the subprograms we use are similar to those in Section 2; they have a Boolean expression hole and one or two command holes (); for each benchmark, we report the number of integer variables (IVars), array variables (AVars), integer constants (Ints) and examples (Exs) that are provided; all benchmark problems are publicly available with our tool. Experiments were conducted on MacBook Pro with Intel Core i7 and 16GB of memory."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "Thus, the technology has been used in automatic problem generation, and the automatic solution finding is able to use the programs for automatic programming, in the way in which they were executed, in the time in which they were executed, in the way in which they were executed, in the way in which they were executed, in the way in which they were executed, in the way in which they were executed, in the way in which they were executed."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we have shown that the combination of enumerative synthesis and static analysis is a promising method for synthesis of introductory imperative programs. Enumerative search allows us to find the smallest possible program, i.e. general program, while semantic static analysis speeds up the process dramaturgically in a safe way. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of 30 real-world programming problems collected in online forums."}], "references": [{"title": "a system to debug student programs", "author": ["Anne Adam", "Jean-Pierre Laurent.
