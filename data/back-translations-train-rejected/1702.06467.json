In June 2016, Facebook1 reported that they have about 1.13 billion active users per day; while in June Twitter2 averaged 313 million active users per month.Due to the large amount of information that is continuously produced on social networks to identify specific individual characteristics of users, the use of paper has been a problem of growing importance for different areas such as forensics, security and marketing (Rangel et al., 2015); problem that author profiling assumes an automatic classification approach based on the premise that depending on the individual characteristics of each person; such as age, gender or personality, the type of communication will be different. Author profiling is traditionally applied in texts such as literature, documentation or essays (Argamon et al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al, 2003; Argamon et al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al, 2009); this type of text has a relatively long duration (2011)."}, {"heading": "2 AGE, GENDER AND PERSONALITY TRAITS PREDICTION", "text": "(Koppel et al., 2002) conducted an investigation using a corpus of 566 documents from the British National Corpus (BNC) 3 in which they automatically identified the gender of the author using function words and POS n-grams, achieving an accuracy of 80% using a linear delimiter. (Doyle and Kes, 2005) constructed a simple classifier to predict the gender in a collection of 495 essays from the BAWE corpus. The classifier consisted in measuring the distance between the text to be classified and two different profiles (man and woman), being the smallest class assigned to the text. An accuracy of 81% was obtained using characters, words and POS n-grams as features.In (Peersman et al., 2011), the authors collected 1.5 million samples from the netlog social network to predict the age and gender of the authors. They used a 1998 model of two words (SVM), with the help of two words (SVM)."}, {"heading": "3 CHARACTER AND POS", "text": "N-GRAMSn-grams are sequences of elements of a selected text information unit (Manning und Sch\u00fctze, 1999) that allow the extraction of content and stylistic features from the text; features that can be used in tasks such as automatic summary, automatic translation and text classification (e.g. in automatic translation and summary, word and phrasegrams are frequently used (Torres-Moreno, 2014; Giannakopoulos et al., 2008; Koehn, 2010); and within the text classification, plagiarism detection, author identification and author profiling; characters, word and POS n-grams are used (Doyle and Kes, 2005; Stamatos et al., 2015; Stamatos et al.; Oberreuter and Vela, quez, 2013).The information units selected in this study are characters and POS tags."}, {"heading": "4 DYNAMIC CONTEXT-DEPENDENT NORMALIZATION", "text": "To minimize these variations, it is necessary to normalize those elements that are able to provide stylistic information independently of their lexical variability (references to other users, hyperlinks, hashtags, emoticons, etc.), which is what we call dynamic context-dependent normalization, which is divided into two phases: text normalization and POS relabeling. \u2022 Text normalization The goal of this phase is to avoid the lexical variability that exists when a user tends to perform certain actions in their texts; for example, marking another user or creating a link to a website. In the case of Twitter, references to other users as @ {username} are defined. The amount of values that can be assigned to the label are the elements that can be assigned to the username that are potentially infinite (depending on the number of users available to the social network)."}, {"heading": "5 DATASETS", "text": "To test different contexts, we used corpora from two social networks: Twitter and Facebook.The multilingual corpus PAN-CLEF2015 (Twitter) is labeled by gender, age and personality traits, while the multilingual corpus PAN-CLEF2016 (Twitter) is labeled by gender and age only.

Character-n-grams have been able to extract emoticons, punctuation exaggerations (flood of characters), the use of uppercase letters, and various types of emotional information in tweets and comments; interaction between the specific elements of social networks, such as references to users, hashtags, or links, and the rest of the POS tags have subsequently been captured with the POS-n-grams; it has also been possible for Spanish and English to capture the most representative set of two and three grammatical elements; for the Italian and Dutch, we have been able to capture the most common grammatical elements; the dynamic context-dependent normalization has been shown to be effective in the different domains (Facebook and Twitter), but also showed problems when cross-domain evaluation has been conducted; the poor results obtained in E1 reflect that it is important to maintain the trait-train-to-test ratio."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This project was partly financed by the CONACyT-Me \u0301 xico project no. 215179 Caracterizacio \u0301 n de huellas textuales para el ana'lisis forense.
