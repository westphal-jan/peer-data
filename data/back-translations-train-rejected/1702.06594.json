Introduction", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we present the VW-CCG formalism. We assume that the reader is already familiar with the basic concepts of categorical grammar, in particular the notion of categories as syntactic types. Like other categorical formalism, VW-CCG grammar has two central components: a lexicon that defines the categories for individual words, and a set of rules that determine how the categories of longer phrases can be derived from the categories of their components."}, {"heading": "2.1 Lexicon", "text": "The VW-CCG dictionary is a series of pairs \u03c3: = X, where \u03c3 is a word (formalized as a symbol of some finite vocabulary) and X is a category. Formally, the set of categories over a particular sentence NP A is the smallest set C (A), so that (i) A C (A) and (ii), if X C (A) and Y C (A) then X / Y C (A) and X / Y C (A). Categories of the form (i) are called atomic, the arguments of the form (ii) are called complex. Categories are usually considered as directed versions of the function types in the simply typed Lambda calculation. Here, we find it useful to deviate from this and view categories as stacks, as in what follows. We treat slashes as links-We..... NPprove..... (S / NP) / NPtwo.. NP / Ntheorems.."}, {"heading": "2.2 Rules", "text": "The rules of the VW-CCG are derived from the combinatorial schemes: X / Y Y Y (X / Y) (X / Y) (X / Y) (X / Z)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Grammars", "text": "Subsequently, we simply refer to the elements of R as rules.Derivations of G are presented as binary trees, whose nodes are labeled with either lexicon entries (leaves) or categories (inner nodes). To represent such trees with linear terms, we use the following terms. Leave A some unspecified alphabets.For a tree, the term represents a tree with a single node."}, {"heading": "3. Complexity Without Categories for UnpronouncedWords", "text": "The ability of the VW-CCG to assign lexicon entries to the empty string contradicts one of the central principles of the CCG, the principle of adjacence, according to which combinatorial rules may apply only to phonologically realized units (Steedman 2000, p. 54). In this section, therefore, we first examine the complexity of the universal recognition problem for a limited version of the VW-CCG, in which this feature is omitted and each lexical category is projected by an open word. We say that a grammar G whose lexicon does not contain mappings of the form \u03b5: = X is \u03b5-free.Theorem 1 The universal recognition problem for a carfree VW-CCG is NP-completed.We divide the proof of this theorem into two parts: section 3.1 shows hardness, section 3.2 shows membership. Section 3.3 contains a brief discussion of the result."}, {"heading": "3.1 NP-Hardness", "text": "We start with the construction of the input string w. \"We then set the icon in the total number of letters in the total number of letters in the total number of letters.

To prove this problem, we provide a polynomial-temporal nondeterministic algorithm that accepts an \u03b5-free VW CCG symbol and a string w if and only if G can apply the usual evidence strategies, in which we can first guess a derivative tree for w and then verify whether this tree is assigned to the valid size of a derivative tree. We must argue that the total number of characters needed to encode a derivative tree is polynomial in the combined size of G and w. Note that this includes both the tree structure itself as well as the lexicon entries and categories at the nodes of the tree. We start with the observation that each derivative tree with leaf nodes (we have inscribed the exact entries)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Discussion", "text": "In the previous sections, we have shown that the universal recognition problem for \u03b5-free VW-CCG is an essential feature of secondary availability (Theorem 1). The result contrasts with the fact that for the weakly equivalent TAG formalism, the universal recognition problem can be solved in polynomial time. This, of course, raises the question of which features of VW-CCG formalism are the source of this additional complexity. We discuss this question on the basis of reduction in our evidence of Lemma 1. In this reduction, we use a combination of three central features of VW-CCG listed below. Each of these features would break our reduction. Lexical Ambiguity of VW-CCG is the first feature of VW-CCG that we use in our construction is the ability to assign more than one category to some lexic elements. \"In the first part of the reduction (Section 3.1.2 Reduction of Truths), this allows us to share truths.\""}, {"heading": "4. ComplexityWith Categories for UnpronouncedWords", "text": "In this section we examine the arithmetical complexity of the universal recognition problem for unrestricted VW-CCG, where even unspoken words may be assigned to lexicon entries. We show the following: Theorem 2 The universal recognition problem for unrestricted VW-CCG is EXPTIME-complete. Proving this theory is more complex than proving NP completeness is given in Section 3. We begin in Section 4.1 with the introduction of Turning-Changing Machines, which form the arithmetic framework for our proof. We then present the hardness of the proof in Section 4.2 and the membership part in Section 4.3. Finally, we discuss our result in Section 4.4."}, {"heading": "4.1 Alternating Turing Machines", "text": "There are two types of states: existential states and universal states. When the machine is in an existential state, it behaves in the usual way by accepting input when there is at least one transition that ultimately leads to an accepting state. In contrast, when the machine is in an existential state, it only accepts when any possible transition ultimately leads to an accepting state. For our proof, we use ATMs that operate in polynomial space, which means that the length of the tape is limited by a polynomial state. In the length of the input, this resource-estricted model is well known in the literature, and it precisely characterizes the class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine that operates at exponential time (Chandra, Kozen and Stockmeyer 1981), which is exactly what we need."}, {"heading": "4.2 EXPTIME-Hardness", "text": "In fact, it is the case that it will be able to put itself at the top of society, which is able to put itself at the top of society."}, {"heading": "4.3 Membership in EXPTIME", "text": "It remains to be proved that the universal recognition for unlimited VW CCG categories amounts directly to a multidimensional table. Universal recognition for unlimited VW CCG categories is in EXPTIME.To show this, we extend an existing recognition algorithm developed by Kuhlmann and Satta (2014), which represents as input a VW CCG symbol without empty categories and a string w, and decide whether there is an idea first presented by Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993). These elementary pieces are specially designed to satisfy two useful characteristics. The first property is that each elementary piece can be stored in a room that does not depend on the length of the room. The second property is that elementary pieces under different derivatives of G. The algorithm uses dynamic mixing to construct and store in a multidimensional table that does not depend on the length of the space, which does not depend on the length of the space."}, {"heading": "4.4 Discussion", "text": "In fact, it is in such a way that most people who see themselves in a position to be able to move, are able to move in the world, to stay in the world, to stay in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the, in the world, in the world, in the world, in, in the, in the, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in the, in, in the, in the, in, in, in, in, in, in the, in, in the, in, in, in, in the, in, in, in, in the, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in, in, in the, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in the, in, in the, in the, in, in, in, in the, in, in, in, in the, in the, in, in, in, in the, in, in the, in the, in, in, in the, in the, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in the, in the, in, in, in the, in, in, in, in the, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in the, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in"}, {"heading": "5.
