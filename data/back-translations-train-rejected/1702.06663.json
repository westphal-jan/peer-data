During the early stages of an epidemic, the ready availability of line lists with detailed tabular information about laboratory-confirmed cases can assist epidemiologists in making reliable inferences and forecasts. Such inferences are crucial to understand the epidemiology of a specific disease early enough to stop or control the outbreak. However, construction of such line lists requires considerable human supervision and therefore, difficult to generate in real-time. In this paper, we motivate Guided Deep List, the first tool for building automated line lists (in near real-time) from open source reports of emerging disease outbreaks. Specifically, we focus on deriving epidemiological characteristics of an emerging disease and the affected population from reports of illness. Guided Deep List uses distributed vector representations (ala word2vec) to discover a set of indicators for each line list feature. This discovery of indicators is followed by the use of dependency parsing based techniques for final extraction in tabular form. We evaluate the performance of Guided Deep List against a human annotated line list provided by HealthMap corresponding to MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. We demonstrate that Guided Deep List extracts line list features with increased accuracy compared to a baseline method. We further show how these automatically extracted line list features can be used for making epidemiological inferences, such as inferring demographics and symptoms-to-hospitalization period of affected individuals.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 03:14:36 GMT  (348kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06663v1", "This paper has been submitted to a conference"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper has been submitted to a conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["saurav ghosh", "prithwish chakraborty", "bryan l lewis", "maimuna s majumder", "emily cohn", "john s brownstein", "madhav v marathe", "naren ramakrishnan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06663"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.06663.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Guided Deep List: Automating the Generation of Epidemiological Line Lists from Open Sources", "authors": ["Saurav Ghosh", "Prithwish Chakraborty", "Bryan L.

MERS was a relatively less understood disease when these outbreaks began. Therefore, MERS was prepared as an emerging outbreak that led to good reporting of individual infections, making these outbreaks ideal for our goals. (a) Demography: age and sex. (b) Disease onset: start date, hospital date and outcome date, and (c) Clinical characteristics: animal contact, secondary contact, comorbidities, and specific health workers (abbreviated to HCW)."}, {"heading": "3 Guided Deep List", "text": "Faced with multiple WHO-MERS bulletins as input, Guided Deep List goes through three modeling levels to extract line list characteristics. We describe each level in turn."}, {"heading": "3.1 Level O Modeling", "text": "In Level 0 modeling, we extract age and gender for each case of the line list. These two features are mentioned in a reasonably structured manner and can therefore be extracted using a combination of regular expressions, as in Algorithm 1. One of the biggest challenges in extracting cases from the line list is the fact that a single WHO-MERS bulletin can contain information about multiple cases. Therefore, there is a need to distinguish between cases mentioned in the Bulletin. In Level 0 modeling, we use the extraction of age and gender to also identify sentences that are related to each case. As age and gender are the basic information that must be recorded for a case of the line list, we postulate that the sentence that mentions age and gender will be the initial sentence that describes a case of the line list (see block of text in Figure 1). Therefore, the number of cases mentioned in the bulletin corresponds to the number of sentences, the number of genders and the number of sentences that are included."}, {"heading": "3.2 WHO Template Learning", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "3.3 Level 1 Modeling", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one sees oneself in a position to reactivate the mentioned ones, but is not yet in a position to reactivate them."}, {"heading": "3.4 Level 2 Modeling", "text": "Dre rf\u00fc ide eeisrcnlhsrtee\u00fccnlhSe in red rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf for the rf"}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we first present a brief description of our experimental setup, including automatic line list extraction models, human annotated line lists, accuracy metrics, and parameter settings."}, {"heading": "4.1 WHO corpus", "text": "The WHO corpus used in the template learning process (see Figure 2) was downloaded from http: / / www.who.int / csr / don / archive / disease / en /.

In the human-commented list, the total number of confirmed cases was curated from 64 WHO bulletins reported between October 2012 and February 2015. Some of these 241 cases have missing (zero) features (see Figure 1). In Figure 5, we show the distribution of non-zero features in the human-commented list.

To judge, the problem is that we get a set of automated line list cases and a set of cases with human comments for a single WHO-MERS bulletin. Our strategy is to create a split chart 17 in which (i) there is an edge when the automated case and the human-annotated case are extracted from the same WHO bulletin, and (ii) the weight at the edge indicates the quality value (QS). The quality value (QS) is defined as the number of correctly extracted features in the automated case divided by the number of non-zero features in the human-annotated case. We then construct a maximum weighted two-part matching. 17 Such matches are performed for each WHO bulletin to extract a set of matches in which each match represents a pair (automated case, human-annotated case) and are associated with a group of QS."}, {"heading": "4.5 Parameter settings", "text": "Each variant of Guided Deep List inherits the parameters of the Word embedding models as shown in Table 5.
