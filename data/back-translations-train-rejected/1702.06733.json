Conjunction holds the lowest formula 1 rating, ignoring rare labels, dep, and punct. Other parsers behave similarly. Connecting errors also occur in simple sentences, such as: (1) \"These machines are still considered novelties, with keyboards that have only one match.\" (2)"}, {"heading": "2 Symmetry between Conjuncts", "text": "It is known that conjunctions are semantically related and often have a similar syntactical structure. This property of coordination was used in earlier work to disambiguate coordination as a guiding principle (Hara et al., 2009; Hogan, 2007; Shimbo and Hara, 2007; Ficler and Goldberg, 2016). While these focus on symmetries between conjunctions in constituency structures, we use the symmetrical annunciation for the purpose of improving dependency analysis.

Characteristics are summarized in Table 2 and are detailed below: CAP - The case where both conjunctions start with a capital letter is much more common (> 3 x) than the case where only one of the headwords begins with a capital letter. These cases are usually names of people, countries and organizations; and generic phrases such as \"Mac and Cheese.\" This characteristic is rare in other labels except nn. We capture this characteristic with a Boolean characteristic that indicates whether both conjunctive headwords begin with a capital letter.

At each step of the parsing process, the parser selects one of two possible transitions: SHIFT, RIGHT (rel), and LEFT (rel). The left and right transitions add a dependency edge to the label rel. At each step, all transitions are evaluated, and the transition with the highest score is applied. Stanford's dependency scheme specifies that the Konj relation appears as a right edge and can therefore only be generated by a RIGHT (conj) transition. We calculate a score sconj that is added to the score of the RIGHT (conj) transition generated by the parser. Sconj is calculated by an MP transition that gets a specific function that forms the MV characteristics and the associated LP parser."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "In fact, it is so that it is a way in which men are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want.

Although we demonstrated their effectiveness in a greedy transition-based parser, the information our features capture is not currently captured by other dependency analysis architectures (including top-notch graph-based parsers, higher-level graph-based parsers, beam-based transition parsers), and these features will be easy to integrate into such parsers, and we expect them to be effective for them, too."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the Israeli Science Foundation (grant number 1555 / 15) and the German Research Foundation via the German-Israeli Project Cooperation (DIP, grant number DA 1600 / 1-1)."}], "references": [{"title": "Globally normalized transition-based neural networks", "author": ["Andor et al.2016] Daniel Andor", "Chris Alberti", "David Weiss", "Aliaksei Severyn", "Alessandro Presta", "Kuzman Ganchev", "Slav Petrov", "Michael Collins"], "venue": "In Proc. of ACL", "citeRegEx": "Andor et al\\.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Andor et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Improved transitionbased parsing by modeling characters instead of words with LSTMs", "author": ["Chris Dyer", "Noah A.
