In such forums, there are often posts with severe content indicating that the user is in acute distress and there is a risk of attempted self-harm. Moderators need to respond to these severe posts in a timely manner to prevent potential self-harm. However, the large volume of daily posted content makes it difficult for the moderators to locate and respond to these critical posts. We present a framework for triaging user content into four severity categories which are defined based on indications of self-harm ideation. Our models are based on a feature-rich classification framework which includes lexical, psycholinguistic, contextual and topic modeling features. Our approaches improve the state of the art in triaging the content severity in mental health forums by large margins (up to 17% improvement over the F-1 scores). Using the proposed model, we analyze the mental state of users and we show that overall, long-term users of the forum demonstrate a decreased severity of risk over time. Our analysis on the interaction of the moderators with the users further indicates that without an automatic way to identify critical content, it is indeed challenging for the moderators to provide timely response to the users in need.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 16:14:12 GMT  (84kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06875v1", "Accepted for publication in Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology (2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication in Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology (2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.SI", "authors": ["arman cohan", "sydney young", "rew yates", "nazli goharian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06875"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.06875.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Triaging Content Severity in Online Mental Health Forums\u2217", "authors": ["Arman Cohan", "Sydney Young", "Andrew Yates", "Nazli Goharian"], "emails": ["arman@ir.cs.georgetown.edu,", "nazli@ir.cs.georgetown.edu,", "sey24@georgetown.edu,", "ayates@mpi-inf.mpg.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Mental health forums are online communities where people express their problems and seek help from moderators and other users.

Our approach to determining the severity of the content is a supervised learning framework. In the following, we first define the severity levels, then explain the features we use for the classification, and finally, describe the learning algorithm."}, {"heading": "3.1 Severity categories", "text": "We consider the following 4 severity levels for the content of the posts as defined by (Milne et al., 2016): \u2022 Green - posts that show no signs or discussions of self-harm and therefore do not require direct input from the moderators. \u2022 Red - posts that indicate that the user is in acute distress and moderators should take care of them as quickly as possible. \u2022 Crisis - posts that indicate that the user is in imminent danger of injuring himself. These posts could be the authors themselves or someone the author of the post knows. Moderators should give priority to these cases over all others.

Most users and visitors are young people between the ages of 14 and 25. ReachOut employs several high-level moderators as well as younger people who are committed to moderating the forum. These moderators focus on cases that require attention and seek to help these individuals by engaging in the discussion, compressing and showing links and resources to the individuals.We use a subset of the ReachOut forum with 65,755 posts, of which 1,188 were classified as problematic by moderators, based on 4 different categories of severity data.

(2016), we use the accuracy and F-1 values to evaluate the classification performance to directly compare the performance of our approach to the state of the art.

(2016) used the macro average of the F values for the non-green (critical) categories as the official measurement for the CLPsych 2016 shared task. This measurement emphasizes the importance of triaggregation between the critical categories. They also take into account the F-1 and accuracy values for the binary classification of FLAGGED (i.e. KRISE, RED, AMBER) vs. GREEN and DRINGENT (i.e. KRISE, RED) vs. Non-URGENT categories to capture the performance of the systems in the identification of critical posts.

We used a feature-rich classifier with various sets of features, including psycholinguistic, contextual, topic-based modeling, and forum metadata functions, to categorize the content into different categories of severity. In addition to a single classifier, we also built an ensemble classifier using different groups of features. We evaluated our approach using data from ReachOut.com, a large mental health forum. We showed that our state-of-the-art approaches can be effectively improved by large margins (up to 17% macro-average F1 values of critical categories). We showed that the content severity of users \"content tends to decrease as they interact with the forum, and the results showed that there is a need for effective and efficient compilation of forum data to help moderators with the health impacts of users."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) with a grant from CNS1204347."}], "references": [{"title": "Suicide statistics 2016", "author": ["American Foundation for Suicide Prevention."], "venue": "AFSP; New York, NY .", "citeRegEx": "Prevention.,? 2016", "shortCiteRegEx": "Prevention.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Probabilistic topic models", "author": ["David M Blei."], "venue": "Communications of the ACM 55(4):77\u201384.", "citeRegEx": "Blei.,? 2012", "shortCiteRegEx": "Blei.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Latent dirichlet allocation", "author": ["David M Blei", "Andrew Y Ng", "Michael I Jordan."], "venue": "Journal of machine Learning research 3(Jan):993\u20131022.", "citeRegEx": "Blei et al\\.,? 2003", "shortCiteRegEx": "Blei et al\\.", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Validating machine learning algorithms for twitter data against established measures of suicidality", "author": ["Scott R Braithwaite", "Christophe Giraud-Carrier", "Josh West", "Michael D Barnes", "Carl Lee Hanson."], "venue": "JMIR mental health 3(2):e21.", "citeRegEx": "Braithwaite et al\\.,? 2016", "shortCiteRegEx": "Braithwaite et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Random forests", "author": ["Leo Breiman."], "venue": "Machine learning 45(1):5\u201332.", "citeRegEx": "Breiman.,? 2001", "shortCiteRegEx": "Breiman.", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Classifying reachout posts with a radial basis function svm", "author": ["Chris Brew."], "venue": "Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Computational Lingusitics and Clinical Psychology.

In such forums, there are often posts with severe content indicating that the user is in acute distress and there is a risk of attempted self-harm. Moderators need to respond to these severe posts in a timely manner to prevent potential selfharm. However, the large volume of daily posted content makes it difficult for the moderators to locate and respond to these critical posts. We present a framework for triaging user content into four severity categories which are defined based on indications of self-harm ideation. Our models are based on a feature-rich classification framework which includes lexical, psycholinguistic, contextual and topic modeling features. Our approaches improve the state of the art in triaging the content severity in mental health forums by large margins (up to 17% improvement over the F-1 scores). Using the proposed model, we analyze the mental state of users and we show that overall, long-term users of the forum demonstrate a decreased severity of risk over time. Our analysis on the interaction of the moderators with the users further indicates that without an automatic way to identify critical content, it is indeed challenging for the moderators to provide timely response to the users in", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
