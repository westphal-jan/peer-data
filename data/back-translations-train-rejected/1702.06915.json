Nevertheless, solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) optimally is NP-hard. Therefore, in large-scale, complex applications, incomplete DCOP algorithms are necessary. Current incomplete DCOP algorithms suffer of one or more of the following limitations: they (a) find local minima without providing quality guarantees; (b) provide loose quality assessment; or (c) are unable to benefit from the structure of the problem, such as domain-dependent knowledge and hard constraints. Therefore, capitalizing on strategies from the centralized constraint solving community, we propose a Distributed Large Neighborhood Search (D-LNS) framework to solve DCOPs. The proposed framework (with its novel repair phase) provides guarantees on solution quality, refining upper and lower bounds during the iterative process, and can exploit domain-dependent structures. Our experimental results show that D-LNS outperforms other incomplete DCOP algorithms on both structured and unstructured problem instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 17:54:23 GMT  (1654kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06915v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:21:38 GMT  (1654kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06915v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ferdinando fioretto", "agostino dovier", "enrico pontelli", "william yeoh", "roie zivan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06915"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.06915.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Solving DCOPs with Distributed Large Neighborhood Search", "authors": ["Ferdinando Fioretto", "Agostino Dovier", "Roie Zivan"], "emails": ["fioretto@umich.edu", "agostino.dovier@uniud.it", "tell@cs.nmsu.edu", "wyeoh@cs.nmsu.edu", "zivanr@cs.bgu.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "\"We are the beneficiaries of any value combination associated with the variables in xfi.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\""}, {"heading": "3 The D-LNS Framework", "text": "In this section, we introduce D-LNS, a general distributed LNS framework for solving DCOPs.

The DPOP-DBR solution phase uses DPOP [17], a complete inference-based algorithm consisting of two phases operating on a DFS pseudo-tree. In the dissemination phase, each agent, starting from the leaves of the pseudo-tree, projects its own variable and sends its projected utilities to the parent. These utilities propagate the pseudo-tree induced by G-k until they reach the root.

For example, complete search algorithms have mechanisms that allow the user to set absolute or relative error limits [13, 27]. Researchers have also worked on non-iterative versions of inference-based incomplete DCOP algorithms, with and without quality guarantees [20, 14, 16]. However, such methods are unable to refine the returned original solution. Finally, the algorithm that is most similar to ours is LS-DPOP [18], which works on a pseudo-tree that performs a local search. However, unlike D-LNS, LS-DPOP only works in a single iteration, does not change its neighborhood and offers no quality guarantees."}, {"heading": "7 Experimental Results", "text": "We evaluate the state-of-the-art D-LNS framework against incomplete DCOP algorithms with and without quality guarantees, selecting representative search, inference, and region approaches.

All algorithms are based on their performance and popularity. We use the following implementations: We use the FRODNS framework [11] to evaluate MS and DSA, 9 the authoring code of BMS [20], and the DALO framework for KOPT and TOPT. We systematically evaluate the time we run the network."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a Distributed Large Neighborhood Search (D-LNS) framework that can be used to find quality-limited solutions in DCOPs. D-LNS consists of a destructive phase that selects a large neighborhood to search for, and a repair phase that performs the search across the selected neighborhood. We introduce two novel distributed repair phases, DPOP-DBR and T-DBR, that are built within the D-LNS framework and characterized by low network usage; in addition, T-DBR provides low computing complexity per agent. Experimental results show that the D-LNS algorithms quickly converge to better solutions, compared with incomplete DCOP algorithms that are representative of search, inference, and region-optimal approaches. The proposed results are significant - the ability of refining online quality guarantees, planning their fast-dependant configuration capabilities, and large-scale solutions to the D-based algorithms, the ability to deploy them in this class D, and the large-scale structures."}], "references": [{"title": "Emergence of scaling in random networks", "author": ["Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si", "R\u00e9ka Albert"], "venue": "Science, 286(5439),", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Including Soft Global Constraints in DCOPs", "author": ["Christian Bessiere", "Patricia Gutierrez", "Pedro Meseguer"], "venue": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP),", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Decentralised coordination of low-power embedded devices using the Max-Sum algorithm", "author": ["Alessandro Farinelli", "Alex Rogers", "Adrian Petcu", "Nicholas Jennings"], "venue": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS),", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Large Neighborhood Search with Quality Guarantees for Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems", "author": ["Ferdinando Fioretto", "Federico Campeotto", "Agostino Dovier", "Enrico Pontelli", "William Yeoh"], "venue": "in AAMAS,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Improving DPOP with branch consistency for solving distributed constraint optimization problems", "author": ["Ferdinando Fioretto", "Tiep Le", "William Yeoh", "Enrico Pontelli", "Tran Cao Son"], "venue": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP),", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Randomized large neighborhood search for cumulative scheduling.", "author": ["Daniel Godard", "Philippe Laborie", "Wim Nuijten"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Maintaining Soft Arc Consistencies in BnB-ADOPT + during Search", "author": ["Patricia Gutierrez", "Jimmy Ho-Man Lee", "Ka Man Lei", "Terrence W.K.

Optimization has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to its ability to address various applications related to multi-agent cooperation. Nevertheless, solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) optimally is NP-hard. Therefore, in large-scale, complex applications, incomplete DCOP algorithms are necessary. Current incomplete DCOP algorithms suffer of one or more of the following limitations: they (a) find local minima without providing quality guarantees; (b) provide loose quality assessment; or (c) are unable to benefit from the structure of the problem, such as domain-dependent knowledge and hard constraints. Therefore, capitalizing on strategies from the centralized constraint solving community, we propose a Distributed Large Neighborhood Search (D-LNS) framework to solve DCOPs. The proposed framework (with its novel repair phase) provides guarantees on solution quality, refining upper and lower bounds during the iterative process, and can exploit domain-dependent structures. Our experimental results show that D-LNS outperforms other incomplete DCOP algorithms on both structured and unstructured problem instances.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
