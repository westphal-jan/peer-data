ONTOLOGY WEB SEARCH ENGINE STRUCTURE", "text": "The task of ontology search requires its decision a long time ago. As is well known, the need to make suggestions, and the solution of ontology search has been found soon. One of these suggestions identifies the steps of ontology search and also defines input as a set of search terms and defines the output as a list of ontologies [7]. This was the most used schema of semantic search, which has been realized many times in the form of the semantic web search engines. SWOOGLE is one of the semantic web search engines for indexing and restoring the semantic web documents, including RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL [8]. SWOOGLE is realized as a web page, and it is available at http: / swoogle.umbc.edudududududu."}, {"heading": "III. ONTOLOGY WEB SEARCH ENGINE REALIZATION AND TESTING", "text": "It is indeed the case that most of us are able to go in search of a solution worthy of the name, \"he said.\" But it is not the case that we go in search of a solution, \"he said.\" But it is not the case that we go in search of a solution. \"He added:\" It is not the case that we go in search of a solution. \"He added:\" But it is not the case that we go in search of a solution. \"He added:\" It is not the case that we go in search of a solution. \""}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper demonstrates the realization and test results of the Ontology Web Search Engine as part of the Semantic Web Expert System. It is obvious that the realization of the Ontology Web Search Engine as a standalone and professional system requires the improvement of all parts of the Ontology Web Search Engine. For example, it is possible that the crawler and the indexer must work in parallel when we talk about professional ontology Web Search Engine. Found ontology URLs must be stored in the database, but not in the text file. It is possible that the crawler must be implemented in programming language C + + in order to work faster. In turn, there is the need for indexing of all ontologies, regardless of the format of the ontologies. In this context, it is necessary to provide another framework for ontology processing in addition to Apache Jena.As for the general conclusions, ontologies cannot completely supplant the regular web pages."}], "references": [{"title": "P", "author": ["J.
