In this section, we will first present some notations referring to directed acyclic graphs (dags) and then definitions related to the theory of semirroring. They are combined to formalize a model of compilation via a commutative semiring. In this paper, parallel arcs are allowed in dags. Therefore, the Arc-Set E of a dag G = (V, E) is a set of elements equipped with the head function: E \u2192 V and the tail-tail-tail \u2192 \u2192 tail-tail-tail-tail-E (V to a tail-tail-tail-tail = V)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Commutative Semiring Computation Graph Parametrized by Monoid Homomorphism", "text": "Our goal in this subsection is to explain another aspect of modularity offered by an algebraic abstraction that has not been described in the past. If an additional condition is imposed on the other side of an arithmetic diagram (G, op, S), the values of the forward variables of the arithmetic diagram can be presented as equivalent to a form that is changed \"globally\" from the original form (3). Consider the dynamic programming of the normalization constant for the linear chain CRFs. The normalization constant is of the form that Yexp (y, x, i), where dynamic programming is based on positions in the sequence. Efficiency of dynamic programming is based on a step-by-step factoring of the target formula by applying the law of distribution of sequencing.

When executing an instance of forward-backward algorithms, the values of the forward variables of a calculation graph are not necessarily stored in each element of V-E during the forward run. Instead, they are stored in the elements of some subsets of V-E called checkpoints, and then necessary values of the forward variables in the reverse run are not necessarily recalculated from stored values near them. One of the obvious good candidates for checkpoints is V. Forward variables are defined on V-E for technical reasons, but the values of a forward-variable on E are not necessarily stored in the forward run of forward-backward algorithms. Instead, the value of a forward variable on each arc can be recalculated."}, {"heading": "4.
