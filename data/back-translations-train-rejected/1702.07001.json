If an agent finds a blocked edge e, he can either traverse another edge or wait for a period of time to check whether e has been opened. The basic CTP is a special case of recoverable CTP where all recovery times are infinitely large. There are two variations of recoverable CTP, deterministic and pochastical. In deterministic variation, the assumption is that the number of edges that can be blocked is limited. In stochastic variation, each edge is associated with a probability that it will be blocked while assuming that the recovery time is not relative to the travel time."}, {"heading": "2.6.2 Disjoint Path Graphs", "text": "The proof is based on the property that commits the optimal policy, which guarantees that when an agent follows a path, the optimal action is continued until the goal is reached, it reaches a blocked edge.

The optimal policy of the CTP on the disjoint path is that the paths through their sequence of Di-parameters is connected to every path in G.
