Patient Safety Event reports are narratives describing potential adverse events to the patients and are important in identifying and preventing medical errors. We present a neural network architecture for identifying the type of safety events which is the first step in understanding these narratives. Our proposed model is based on a soft neural attention model to improve the effectiveness of encoding long sequences. Empirical results on two large-scale real-world datasets of patient safety reports demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with significant improvements over existing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 04:27:49 GMT  (22kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07092v1", "ECIR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ECIR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["arman cohan", "allan fong", "nazli goharian", "raj ratwani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07092"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.07092.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Neural Attention Model for Categorizing Patient Safety Events", "authors": ["Arman Cohan", "Allan Fong", "Nazli Goharian", "Raj Ratwani"], "emails": ["arman@ir.cs.georgetown.edu", "nazli@ir.cs.georgetown.edu", "allan.fong@medicalhfe.org", "raj.ratwani@medicalhfe.org"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: natural language processing, word categorization, medical word processing, deep learning"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "There is an increasing demand for textual electronic health records and clinical notes to promote medication, and as such, in recent years NLP / IR have become increasingly important for understanding, searching and analyzing medical information [22].
