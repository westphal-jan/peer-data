However, giving an achievable framework to the process towards this has been a difficult task. In this work we take the classic data information knowledge wisdom (DIKW) framework to set some achievable goals and sub-goals towards cognitive engineering. A layered framework like DIKW aligns nicely with the layered structure of pre-frontal cortex. And breaking the task into sub-tasks based on the layers also makes it easier to start developmental endeavours towards achieving the final goal of a brain-inspired system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 10:51:32 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07168v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amit kumar mishra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07168"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.07168.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A DIKW Paradigm to Cognitive Engineering", "authors": ["Amit Kumar Mishra"], "emails": ["akmishra@ieee.org"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "It is possible that we will see this billion-dollar investment in the development of the new discipline of artificial neural networks (ANN).

Therefore, we believe that the implementation of this approach will create a truly cognitive system.The merit of the architecture presented is that it is based on the DIKW paradigm, which is well understood and therefore enables an easy understanding of the architecture.Secondly, this approach has helped us to break down the architecture into different blocks, which helps in the further analysis of the architecture and helps in its implementation. Finally, we have also provided execution blocks that allow a complete implementation of the architecture.It can be noted that almost three of the execution blocks cannot be implemented with the current technology.However, the beauty of the architecture is that due to the layering of nature, we can still implement a part of it and experiment with it. This also helps in defining a roadmap for the future development, which will help in the implementation of the architecture to the fulle.We believe that the proposed architecture will also help cognitive engineers in the implementation of the architecture."}], "references": [{"title": "How people learn: Brain, mind, experience, and school", "author": ["J.D.
