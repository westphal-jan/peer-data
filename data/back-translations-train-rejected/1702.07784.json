INTRODUCTION", "text": "With the proliferation of social networking services and ever-new connected devices, social interactions have increasingly shifted online as social media has become an integral part of people's everyday lives. However, at the same time, new instances of negative interactions have emerged, including aggressive and harassing tweets among online users. Cyberbullying, the digital manifestation of bullying and aggression in online social interactions, has spread to various platforms such as Twitter [23], Youtube [6], Ask.fm [14, 15] and Facebook [27]. Other community-based services such as Yahoo Answers [16], and online gaming platforms are no exception [18]. Research has shown that bullying actions are often organized, with online users called to participate in hate-filled crackdowns against other users of social networks [13]. The Gamergate controversy [17] is an example of a coordinated campaign of harassment in the online world."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Previous research has examined and aims to identify abusive, aggressive and bullying content on social media with selected images - including Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and Ask.fm. Next, we will cover related work on this type of behavior in general, as well as work related to the Gamergate case. Detection of abusive behavior by Yahoo and al.

In particular, in [15], in addition to considering Xiv: 170 2.07 784v 1 [cs.S I] 2 4Fe b20 17available text information, they also try to link the subject of an image (e.g. drugs, celebrity, sports, etc.) to possible cyberbullying events, with drugs being strongly associated with cyberbullying."}, {"heading": "3. METHODOLOGY", "text": "In this section, we present our methodology for collecting and processing a data set of abusive behavior on Twitter. In this post, we focus on the Gamergate case, but our methodology can be generalized to other platforms and case studies."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Collection", "text": "The first step is to select one or more keywords that are likely to be related to the occurrence of abusive events. (In addition to # GamerGate, good examples include # BlackLivesMatter and # PizzaGate. In addition to such keywords, there are a number of keywords that can be used to filter posted texts, e.g. words extracted from the Hatebase database (HB) 1 to begin collecting potential abusive texts from social media sources. Therefore, the list of words used to filter posted texts contains only the seed (s), i.e., L (t1) = < seed (s) >.In our case, we focus on Twitter, and more specifically, we rely on the Twitter Streaming API2, which provides access to 1% of all tweets."}, {"heading": "3.2 Data Processing", "text": "We remove stopwords, URLs, numbers and punctuation marks. In addition, we normalize, i.e. we remove repeated letters and repetitive characters that users often use to express their feelings more intensely (e.g., the word \"hellooo\" is changed to \"hello\"). Spam removal. Although extensive work has been done on spam detection on social media, e.g. [9, 24, 28], Twitter is still full of spam accounts [5] that often use vulgar language and display behavior (repeated posts with similar content, mentions or hashtags) that could also be considered aggressive or bullying. To eliminate some of this noise, we proceeded with a spam removal process, taking into account two attributes that were already used as filters (e.g. [28]) to remove spam occurrences."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS", "text": "In this section, we present the results of our measurement-based characterization by comparing basic data and Gamergate (GG) related data sets in various dimensions, including user attributes, posting activity, content semantics, and Twitter account status."}, {"heading": "4.1 How Active are Gamergaters?", "text": "A basic question about the Gamergate controversy is what first started: Participants who tweeted about it or Twitter users who participated in Gamergate = 42. In other words, did Gamergate draw people to Twitter, or were Twitter users drawn to Gamergate? In Figure 2a, we plot the distribution of the account age for users in the Gamergate dataset and baseline users. In most cases, GG users tend to have older accounts (mean = 982.94 days, median = 788 days, STD = 772.49 days). The mean, mean and STD values for the random users are 834.39, 522, and 652.42 days, respectively, based on a two-sample KolmogorovSmirnov test, 3 the two distributions differ with a test statistic D = 0.20142 and p < 0.01. Overall, the oldest account in our dataset is a GG user, belonging to one account in 64 base accounts accounts, while only accounts in 64 accounts."}, {"heading": "4.2 How Social are Gamergaters?", "text": "To give an idea of how \"social\" gamergaters are, Figures 4a and 4b show the distribution of friends and followers for GG users over base users. We observe that GG users surprisingly tend to have more friends and followers (D = 0.34 and 0.39, p < 0.01 for both). Although this may be somewhat counterintuitive, the reality is that Gamergate was born on social media and the controversy seems to be a clear \"us versus them\" situation, leading to easy identification of group membership and thus increasing the likelihood of relationship building. The ease of group membership is slightly different from the polarization of issues in the real world, where it can be difficult to know a person's views on a polarizing issue without actually involving them in the issue."}, {"heading": "4.3 How Different is Gamergater\u2019s Content?", "text": "\"I think it's going to take a lot of time for people to come to terms with the fact that they're not going to be able to afford to pay for their health care,\" he said, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the health of the health care system and that he was \"not going to be able to afford to pay for it.\""}, {"heading": "4.4 Are Gamergaters Suspended More Often?", "text": "A Twitter user may be in one of the following three states: active, deleted or suspended. Typically, Twitter suspends an account (temporarily or even permanently, in some cases) if it has been hijacked / compromised, is considered spam / fake, or if it is abuse.44 https: / / support.twitter.com / articles / 15790A user account is deleted if the user owner of the account disables his account. Below, we examine the differences between these three states in terms of GG and base users. To examine these differences, we focus on a sample of 33k users both from the GG and base records. From Table 1, we note that users are suspended more often in both cases than users in the base file. However, baseline users are more susceptible to being suspended (20%) or deleting their accounts (13%) than users in the base file."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "We collected 1.6 million tweets from 340k unique users using a generic methodology (which can also be used for other platforms and other case studies), and although we focused on a narrow time frame, we found that users tweeting about Gamergate generally seem to be Twitter savvy and quite busy with the platform, producing more tweets than random users, and also having more friends and followers. Surprisingly, although these users express more negative feelings overall, they differ significantly from random users only in terms of enjoyment. Finally, we investigated account suspensions and found that gaming users are less likely to be suspended due to inherent difficulties in detecting and combating online harassment activity. Although we believe that our work contributes to understanding large-scale online harassment, it is only a start. As part of future work, we plan to conduct a more in-depth study of Gamergate over time and how it has evolved over time."}, {"heading": "6. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] Anonymous.
