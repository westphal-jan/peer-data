Furthermore, most simplified mathematical models show the same statistical properties when their parameters are adjusted correctly. As such, it is sufficient to study N particle systems with simple, \"atomic\" components and interactions, since they exhibit many non-trivial properties that lie within the large N boundary."}, {"heading": "2 Brief summary of critical phenomena", "text": "Critical phenomena were first thoroughly explained and analyzed in the field of statistical mechanics, although they have been observed in various other systems, but without theoretical understanding. The study of criticality belongs to statistical physics and is an incredibly rich and wide field, so we can only briefly summarize a few results that are of interest to this article; in any case, a much broader coverage can be found, see e.g. [14, 15, 16, 17]. Thus, one looks at systems that consist of (families of) many identical particles and attempts to derive properties for macroscopic parameters, such as density or polarization from the microscopic properties and interactions of the particles."}, {"heading": "2.1 Curie-Weiss model", "text": "A simplistic, fully solvable model of a magnetic field is the Curie-White model (CW) = \u03b2 factor = any interaction with the spin system. It has many interesting features, exhibits critical behavior, and correctly predicts some of the experimental results. As its mathematics will be used later in our deep learning setup, we will briefly present the most important properties and solutions for the sake of self-consistency. The Hamiltonian model of the CW model is of H = \u2212 J 2N N N N N value ij sisj \u2212 b N si (1) Here the si are a collection of interacting \"particles,\" in our physical case, that interact with each other via the J coupling and interact in pairs; the inclusion of a factor of 1N multiplies the square spin within the large N boundary."}, {"heading": "2.2 Criticality in real-world networks", "text": "Two of the main reasons why we seek critique and exploit it in artificial networks are the universal occurrence of this phenomenon and various references to its occurrence in biological [4] and neural systems [25, 22]; as soon as systems become sufficiently \"respectable\" and become more complex, critical behavior arises, which also applies to man-made networks [23]. Various metrics can be formulated to detect critique, and they all show the behavior of power laws. Similar behaviors can be uncovered in various other networks, e.g. the number of links to a source and the number of linkages away from a source, both exhibit a power-law distributionP (k) k \u2212 \u03b3 (9) for a power coefficient 6 = 0. Similar behavior can be uncovered in various other networks, if it is respectable enough, such as quotation behavior of scientific articles, social networks, etc. A simple, generic measure of networks is also a point of critique (where the number is also defined as the number of critical)."}, {"heading": "3 Criticality in deep learning nets", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 From feed-forward to fully connected architecture", "text": "We will now concentrate on a feed network, with two layers, ai and bj connected by a weight matrix wij; To check our system for criticism, we will write down its HamiltonianH = \u2212 1 2N \u2211 ij wijaibj \u2212 h N \u2211 i bi (11), which was first formulated in the groundbreaking paper [9].

After a brief introduction to criticality in statistical physics and real networks, we started with the theoretical construction of a fully networked layer. We used continuous techniques to approach the medium field to tackle the partition function of the system, and ended with a system of differential equations that determine the critical behavior of the system. These equations can be the starting point for a possible network architecture with induced criticality and learning rules that exploit criticality. Afterwards, we presented results of experiments aimed at finding traces of power-law distributions in current deep learning networks such as multilayered feed-forward networks, revolutionary networks and autoencoders. Results - with the exception of the autoencoder - were affirmative in a negative sense, next building the need to create networks with induced criticism and learning rules that exploit the critical state."}, {"heading": "A Different unit values", "text": "We show here that the partition function with Hamiltonian H {0,1} = \u2211 ij aiwijaj + hiai (31), whose units assume values in {0, 1}, exhibits the same qualities as they are encoded in the partition function with Hamiltonian H {\u00b1 1}, whose units assume values in {\u00b1 1}.
