DeepNAT is an end-to-end learning-based approach to brain segmentation that jointly learns an abstract feature representation and a multi-class classification. We propose a 3D patch-based approach, where we do not only predict the center voxel of the patch but also neighbors, which is formulated as multi-task learning. To address a class imbalance problem, we arrange two networks hierarchically, where the first one separates foreground from background, and the second one identifies 25 brain structures on the foreground. Since patches lack spatial context, we augment them with coordinates. To this end, we introduce a novel intrinsic parameterization of the brain volume, formed by eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As network architecture, we use three convolutional layers with pooling, batch normalization, and non-linearities, followed by fully connected layers with dropout. The final segmentation is inferred from the probabilistic output of the network with a 3D fully connected conditional random field, which ensures label agreement between close voxels. The roughly 2.7 million parameters in the network are learned with stochastic gradient descent. Our results show that DeepNAT compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the purely learning-based method may have a high potential for the adaptation to young, old, or diseased brains by fine-tuning the pre-trained network with a small training sample on the target application, where the availability of larger datasets with manual annotations may boost the overall segmentation accuracy in the future.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 08:53:31 GMT  (4646kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08192v1", "Accepted for publication in NeuroImage, special issue \"Brain Segmentation and Parcellation\", 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication in NeuroImage, special issue \"Brain Segmentation and Parcellation\", 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["christian wachinger", "martin reuter", "tassilo klein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08192"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.08192.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "DeepNAT: Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Segmenting Neuroanatomy", "authors": ["Christian Wachingera", "Martin Reuter", "Tassilo Klein"], "emails": ["christian.wachinger@med.uni-"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We introduce DeepNAT, a 3D Deep Convolutional Neural Network for the automatic segmentation of NeuroAnaTomy into T1-weighted magnetic resonance images.

Introduction", "text": "Accurate segmentation of neuroanatomy forms the basis for volume, thickness, and shape measurements from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is extensively studied in neuroscience to track structural changes in the brain associated with aging and disease. In addition, such quantitative measurements include an enormous phenotypical characterization of an individual and can serve as endophenotypes for disease. As manual segmentation of brain MRI scans is time-consuming, computational tools have been developed to reconstruct neuroanatomy, which is particularly important for the rapidly growing number of large-scale brain studies. One of the most commonly used software tools for overall brain segmentation is FreeSurfer (Fischl et al), which applies an atlas-based segmentation strategy. This secondary work promotes research into atlas-based segments, with a focus on multiatlas techniques and brand strategies (Ashburston)."}, {"heading": "2. Method", "text": "A probabilistic label map L = {L1,..., L\u03b7} indicates the probability for each brain marker L = {1,..., \u03b7} Ll (x) = p (S (x) = l | I; I, S). (1) Let I (Nx) center an image spot at position x, where the probability in a patch-based segmentation approach is isLl (x) = p (S (x) = l | I (Nx); I, S). (2) We estimate the probability by training a deep revolutionary neural network in which the patch inference corresponds to the multi-class classification."}, {"heading": "2.1. Hierarchical Segmentation", "text": "Figure 1 illustrates the hierarchical approach to overall brain segmentation in DeepNAT. In the first cascade, brain regions are divided into foreground and background. In the foreground, 25 large brain structures are shown in Figure 7. Background is the region within the brain mask that is not part of the foreground. Data that is classified as foreground passes through the next cascaded step to identify separate brain structures. Given the inherent class imbalance, hierarchical segmentation has the potential to perform better than a single-step classification that is classified in both brain regions and background. Problems with a large background class were previously known in atlas-based segmentation (Wachinger and Golland, 2014). Background is typically represented by a large data pool, while small brain structures are prone to be underrepresented."}, {"heading": "2.2. Network Architecture", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they play by the rules, and they are able to play by the rules that they play by the rules."}, {"heading": "2.3. Multi-task Learning", "text": "In Equation. (2) we use an image patch to predict the tissue marking of the middle voxel. This conclusion on the entire image results in a single voice per voxel. However, previous results of patch-based segmentation have shown the advantage of propagating not only the middle label, but also adjacent labels (Rousseau et al., 2011). With such an approach, the voxel label is derived not only from a single patch, but also from adjacent patches. Rousseau et al. (2011) refer to this as the multipoint method in the context of non-local middle segmentation. We propose to replicate the multipoint method for DCNN segmentation by applying multi-task learning. Instead of learning a single task that the center label predicts, we simultaneously learn several tasks that predict the center and the surrounding neighborhood. The neighborhood size determines the number of tasks, while we are using the segmentation for the YTask Architecture (the YTask Architecture 2015), we are using the multi-learning for the Lugong."}, {"heading": "2.4. Spectral Brain Coordinates", "text": "Given the symmetry of the brain, it is easy to confuse patches across hemispheres. Furthermore, the context provides valuable information for structures with low tissue contrast. To increase self-information, we extend self-interpretations with location information. Previous approaches have, for example, used Cartesian coordinates (Wachinger et al., 2014) or distances to centroids (Brebisson and Montana, 2015). We suggest that self-interpretation of the brain as an alternative parameter of brain volume obtained by calculating self-function of the LaplaceBeltrami operator within the 3D brain mask. Self-function of the cortex surface of the brain has previously been used for brain mapping (Lombaert et al., 2013b, a) and self-function as form descriptors (Wachinger et al, 2015b)."}, {"heading": "2.5. Fully Connected Conditional Random Field", "text": "The DCNN prediction results in a probable brain segmentation. To obtain the final segmentation, we use maximum a posteriori inference to a conditional random field (CRF). CRF allows the formulation of potentials that ensure a match between narrow voxels with smooth terms and follow the image content with appearance. Traditionally, short-term CRFs are used with connections between adjacent locations (Wang et al., 2013a), which can, however, lead to an excessive smoothing of organ boundaries. In contrast, the fully connected CRF defines paired potentials on all pairs of image locations. The enormous number of paired potentials that can be defined makes conventional conclusions impractical. We use the highly efficient approximate inference algorithm proposed by Kra \u00b6 henbu \u00b8 hl and Koltun (2011) to infer a fully connected CRF model to the entire 3D brain's potential."}, {"heading": "3.

Discussion", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one is able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution that is capable of finding a solution, and that is able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution that is capable of finding a solution, that is able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution, that is able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution, that is able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution, that is able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "The most important contributions were (i) multi-task learning, (ii) hierarchical segmentation, (iii) spectral coordinates and (iv) a fully networked contingent random 3D field. Multi-task learning simultaneously learns to predict labels in a small neighborhood. Spectral coordinates form an intrinsic parameterization of brain volume and provide context information on patches. The hierarchical approach takes into account the class imbalance between the background class and separate brain structures. Finally, the contingent random field ensures label alignment between narrow voxels. We train the 3D network by integrating the latest advances in deep learning to initialize weights to correct internal covariable shifts and limit the overfitting of such complex models. Our results showed the high potential of convolutionary neural networks for segmentation neuroanatomy.All epical networks are suitable for lake depth training, which is likely to be useful for deep-seeding tasks."}, {"heading": "6.

DeepNAT is an end-to-end learning-based approach to brain segmentation that jointly learns an abstract feature representation and a multi-class classification. We propose a 3D patch-based approach, where we do not only predict the center voxel of the patch but also neighbors, which is formulated as multi-task learning. To address a class imbalance problem, we arrange two networks hierarchically, where the first one separates foreground from background, and the second one identifies 25 brain structures on the foreground. Since patches lack spatial context, we augment them with coordinates. To this end, we introduce a novel intrinsic parameterization of the brain volume, formed by eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As network architecture, we use three convolutional layers with pooling, batch normalization, and non-linearities, followed by fully connected layers with dropout. The final segmentation is inferred from the probabilistic output of the network with a 3D fully connected conditional random field, which ensures label agreement between close voxels. The roughly 2.7 million parameters in the network are learned with stochastic gradient descent. Our results show that DeepNAT compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the purely learning-based method may have a high potential for the adaptation to young, old, or diseased brains by fine-tuning the pre-trained network with a small training sample on the target application, where the availability of larger datasets with manual annotations may boost the overall segmentation accuracy in the future.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
