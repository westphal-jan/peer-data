PERSONALITY", "text": "In this section, we will discuss the most prominent approaches to measuring human personality and explain the details of the method we have chosen to investigate. Personality determines people's behavior, cognition and emotion. Different personality theorists present their own definitions of personality and various ways to measure them based on their theoretical positions.The most popular approach is to determine personality through a series of questions. There are several simplified rules that have been developed over the years to profile human personality.The most popular are: 1. the five-factor model (aka FFM or \"Big Five\"), which uses five broad dimensions to describe human personality [13]; 2. belbin theory [6], which provides a theory of how different role types affect teamwork; and 3. the Myers-Briggs type indicator (MBTI) scheme designed to show psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions."}, {"heading": "4.

Therefore, the higher the value of the function ucon (K), the more diverse the team is.

Repeated tasks require good competence and less communication. The meaning of competence (\u03bb) and congeniality (\u00b5) is therefore a fundamental aspect of the task type. Now, in a team, we can combine its competence value (in Eq. 1) with its congeniality value (in Eq. 2) to measure its synergistic value. Definition 11. In a team K, a task type (K) = < \u03bb, (ci, li, wi)} i value and a task assignment (in Eq. 2) the synergistic value of team K is defined as: s (K, \u03b7) = profile character (K) + profile characteristic (K), where congeniality (1) is the general unit of a team, we prefer between one and another."}, {"heading": "4.6 The synergistic team composition problem", "text": "What follows is that there are several instances of the same task that we have to perform.

Therefore, we can consider our team composition problem as a certain type of fixed composition problem. We will refer to any composition of A as team composition. However, we are interested in a certain type of team composition, namely those where the teams are defined by size m as follow.Definition 12.

We note down the number of agents in A using n = | A, using m \u00b2 N the target number of agents in each team, and using b the minimum total number of agents, b = bn / mc.

Firstly, we generate a ranking based on actual team performance, which will be our basis for comparing other rankings. Secondly, we create a ranking based on expert ratings. Finally, we generate multiple rankings based on calculated synergistic scores with varying degrees of ingenuity and competence. Since \"Traball de S'\u0131ntesi\" is a creative task, we want to examine the rating function based on the parameters \u00b5 > 0 and \u03bb = 1 \u2212 \u00b5. Specifically, we want to observe how rankings change when the importance of competences is increased. Note that teachers and actual performance rankings can involve ties, as the pool of possible grades is more discreet (which is highly unlikely in the case of SynTeam rankings)."}, {"heading": "7. DISCUSSION", "text": "In this work, we have introduced SynTeam, an algorithm for dividing groups of people into competent, gender-specific and psychologically balanced teams. To our knowledge, SynTeam is the first computational model to form synergistic teams that not only work well together, but are competent enough to perform a task that requires particular expertise. We have decided to evaluate our algorithm in the context of a classroom. In addition to obvious advantages of personal observation of students, this scenario has given us the opportunity to compare our results with real practice currently in use. Results show that SynTeam is able to predict team performance better than the experts who know the students, their social background, their skills and cognitive abilities. The algorithm is potentially useful for any organization that faces the need to optimize its problem-solving teams (e.g. a classroom, a company, a research unit). The algorithm assembles teams purely automatically, without consulting experts, which is a huge advantage to them."}], "references": [{"title": "Network flows: Theory, algorithms, and applications", "author": ["Ravindra K.
