In subsequent years, studies on prosthetic control led to much progress in the analysis and understanding of sEMG. Castellini et al.

Several studies went in this direction with different strategies to develop more robust models that exploit earlier information from subjects or are reusable in the context of repeatability from the target itself.

In the context of myoelectric classification, the input signals are the myoelectric signals and the labels are the movements selected from a range of G-possible classes. The aim of a classification algorithm is to find a function h (x) that can determine the corresponding output y for each future input vector x. Among the algorithms constructing such a model, support vector machines (SVMs) are some of the most popular. The basis of the domain adaptation algorithms described later is the Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) [15], a variant of SVM with a squared loss and equality limitation."}, {"heading": "B.

Data", "text": "The data used in our work comes from the NinaPro database1 [14], the largest publicly accessible database for the classification of prosthetic movements with 40 subjects intact and 11 amputees. Each subject performed 40 movements six times, so that each repetition was performed alternately with a resting position. During the execution of the movements, twelve electrodes received sEMG data from the subject's arm. The standardized data were used according to the control scheme of Englehart and Hudgins [19], extracting features from a sliding window of 200 ms and a step of 10 ms. The resulting window set was then divided into traction and test sets for the classifier; data from repetitions {1, 3, 4, 6} were devoted to the training, while data from repetitions 2 and 5 were used as a test. To reduce the calculation requirements, we examined the training data at regular intervals by a factor of 10."}, {"heading": "B. Classifiers", "text": "The algorithms used to create the classification models were the two aforementioned HTL algorithms together with two baselines: \u2022 the no-transfer model (NoTransfer), in which anLS-SVM with RBF kernel is trained only on the target data, corresponding to learning without prior knowledge. \u2022 the previous model (Prior), in which an LS-SVM with linear kernel is learned via the raw forecasts of the source models, which measures the relevance of the source hypotheses by using them as feature extractors for the target data. \u2022 Multi Model Knowledge Transfer (MultiKT), as explained in Section III-B.1, in which a model is learned on the target data that comes close to a weighted combination of the source hypotheses. \u2022 Multi Kernel Adaptive Learning (MKAL), as explained in Section III-B.2, which combines a linear RBF kernel on the target data with the source data."}, {"heading": "C. Settings", "text": "For each of the settings, we conducted three experiments with different groups of target and source subjects: \u2022 Intact-Intact 17: intact targets, which primarily take advantage of the nodes of other intact subjects; \u2022 Amputee-Amputee targets, each suitable as a target; \u2022 Amputee-Intact: amputee targets, which deal with intact subjects, who only used the role of the target once, while the remaining subjects were used as sources; and in the third, all of the amputee database were once the target and the set of intact subjects was used only as a starting point.) The purpose of the original and optimized settings is to examine the isolated effects of hyperparameter optimization on the performance of the target classifiers. We replicated as closely as possible, the experiments of Patricia et al al al al al al al al al al. [5]"}, {"heading": "V. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this section, we will first examine the isolated effects of hyperparameter optimization on the original setting. We will then verify that the results also apply to 3Data for the first amputated subject, as the recording was interrupted prematurely. 4Each repetition consists of approximately 35,000 samples. The realistic setting described in Section IV-C.3. follows the explanations of the results of an in-depth discussion."}, {"heading": "A. Results", "text": "In Figure 1, we report on the balanced classification accuracy as a function of the number of training samples averaged across all target subjects, and the dotted lines show the results obtained in the original experimental framework normally used in the literature (see Section IV-C.1). As in the related studies, MKAL and MultiKT significantly outperform the baselines NoTransfer and Prior. This has led to the assertion that the adaptive algorithms can achieve similar performance to NoTransfer by using an order of magnitude fewer training samples. As this improvement is observed to see whether the target and source persons are intact or amputated, it is also assumed that amputees can equally exploit earlier information from intact subjects as well as other amputated subjects. Considering the continuous lines in Figure 1, which show results with hyperparameter optimization, we find that the discrepancies between the algorithms disappear. In other words, the transfers baseline performs are just as good or even slightly better than the adaptive ones of these hyper-performs."}, {"heading": "B. Discussion", "text": "The results clearly show that the improvements that are usually attributed to prior knowledge can instead be explained by suboptimal hyperparameter optimization. If properly tuned, the NoTransfer baseline, which completely ignores source information, as well as the more complicated domain matching methods, leads to several explanations for the observed performance differences in the original setting. Firstly, the hyperparameters were selected based on the performance of an SVM when transferring from the source subjects to the target subjects, which results in a disadvantage for NoTransfer, which does not use previous knowledge to train the classifier. Furthermore, this parameter setting is also problematic as all methods are based on LS-SVM, which uses a loss function other than SVM. As seen in the objective function in Equation 1, the regulation parameter C is multiplied by the absolute order of all training losses, so that an optimal setting for LS-SVM does not necessarily work well."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we tested two popular domain adaptation algorithms that have been proposed to reduce the training time needed to control a prosthesis. We found that the improvements in previous studies were in fact due to suboptimal hyperparameter optimization, which in particular punishes the NoTransfer reference method. If the hyperparameters are adjusted accordingly to the training data of the target, the previously reported differences disappear. This result also applies to the correction of other technical and conceptual errors in the original experimental framework. Again, we do not observe any differences between the HTL algorithms in our updated setting in terms of the number of repetitions of each movement, which represents the actual effort for the user during the training phase, and for all subjects in the NinaPro database. Again, we do not observe any differences between the HTL algorithms and the NoTransfer base. Intuitively, it should be possible to improve the performance of a given task by using prior information from related tasks."}], "references": [{"title": "Epidemiologic overview of individuals with upper-limb loss and their reported research priorities", "author": ["D.J.

Also when correcting for this mistake, we do not find any performance increase due to the use of prior models.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
