Characterisation of users into socio-demographic groups is crucial to improve these analyses. Here we undertake the classification of social media users as supporting or opposing ongoing independence movements in their territories. Independence movements occur in territories whose citizens have conflicting national identities; users with opposing national identities will then support or oppose the sense of being part of an independent nation that differs from the officially recognised country. We describe a methodology that relies on users' self-reported location to build datasets for three territories -- Catalonia, the Basque Country and Scotland -- and we test language-independent classifiers using four types of features. We show the effectiveness of the approach to build large annotated datasets, and the ability to achieve accurate, language-independent classification performances ranging from 85% to 97% for the three territories under study.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 17:19:03 GMT  (1994kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08388v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 18:01:10 GMT  (1994kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08388v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["arkaitz zubiaga", "bo wang", "maria liakata", "rob procter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08388"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.08388.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Stance Classification of Social Media Users in Independence Movements", "authors": ["Arkaitz Zubiaga", "Bo Wang", "Maria Liakata", "Rob Procter"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index terms - social media, national identity, sociodemographic data, classification.F"}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "SOCIAL media are becoming an increasingly important source of data mining applications, including exploratory research used as a means of analysing political and social issues or information and news gathering. However, one of the problems with social media is the limited availability of socio-demographic details of users that would allow the development of data mining tools that take into account the many different realities in society. Attempting to mitigate this problem shows that an increasing number of research in the field of natural language processing and data mining deals with the automated return of socio-demographic characteristics such as age and gender, country of origin [1] or political orientation [2]. Following this line of research, we describe and evaluate a data collection and classification methodology that allows two groups of social media users to identify themselves in areas with active independence movements: those who support independence, and those who oppose it (anti-independence nationality) as different parts of an independent Catalan population are motivated by national identity movements."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "The most relevant work on what we report here is that of Fang et al. [4], which attempts to classify users \"voting intentions in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. However, their work focused on determining users\" voting intentions during a particular referendum and not on determining users \"national identity. As they were limited to a single territory - Scotland - they introduced a language-based approach that identifies issues that were discussed during the referendum campaign in order to determine users\" attitudes. While the classification of users by political orientation is also related to our work, such as Xiv: 170 2.08 388v 2 [cs.C L] 20 Jun 20172 Republicans or Democrats in the US [2] or Conservatives or Workers in the UK [5], national identities reflect independent dimensions that are not necessarily linked to partisanship. Citizens with shared national identities can also choose parties with different political ideologies, and their cultural backgrounds and may instead be motivated by similar linguistic identities [6]."}, {"heading": "3 DATA COLLECTION", "text": "Our data collection method relies on users \"self-reported location as a proxy for identifying the territory that users claim to be citizens, which directly indicates their attitude to the current independence movement in their territory. We identify different place names for each territory, with which either pro-independence or anti-independence supporters identify, giving us basic truths to determine their stance. We rely on the following approaches for the three areas studied, whose users rely on the fact that Catalonia has an ongoing independence movement and whose citizens feel either Catalan (pro-independence) or Spanish (anti-independence). For the generation of datasets that distinguish these two national identities, we rely on the fact that Catalans whose profile includes the Catalans, Catalans, Catalans or their acronym PPCC (i.e. Catalan Countries) blatantly claim to be citizens of an independent Catalonia."}, {"heading": "3.1 User Data Collection", "text": "For each user in our final dataset, we collect three different types of data: (1) the 500 most recent tweets posted by the user, (2) the 500 most recent tweets that the user favors1, and (3) the entire list of users that the user follows and is followed by. The final collection for the three areas includes 27.4 million tweets, including timelines and favorites, as well as 19.1 million different users that occur on the following networks."}, {"heading": "4 STANCE CLASSIFICATION IN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Task Definition", "text": "The classification of social media users differs from the increasingly popular classification of texts [7] in that the attitude is explicitly expressed in each text for the latter, while for users behavioural patterns must be compiled that are extracted from historical characteristics of their account. Input to the classifier is a group of users from a specific territory. In order to build the classification model, a group of users is used for one characterised by Y = {PI, AI} (PI = pro-independence, AI = 1. Tweets favoured by a user are not available via the Twitter API and were instead collected by scraping the web interface. 3 Anti-independence)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Classification Settings", "text": "We perform the classification experiments in a layered, 10x cross-validation setting for each area. We measure the values micro-average to aggregate performance in different folds and report on the final accuracy values. We use four different classifiers for the experiment: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Maximum Entropy. We use four different types of classification characteristics, all independent of the location we used to determine the basic truth: 1) Timeline: We use Word2Vec embeddings [8] to represent the content of a user's timeline of the most recent tweets. 2) Interactions: We consider that a user tweets to be retweeting data for each area based on the entire collection of tweets. We represent each tweet as the average of embeddings for each word and finally get the average of all tweets."}, {"heading": "5 RESULTS", "text": "Table 2 shows the classification results for the three areas. It shows that among the four types of characteristics studied, a user's network is the most indicative feature for determining their posture. This indicates that users belonging to different identity groups tend to be associated with different users on Twitter. The other characteristics lag significantly behind the performance of network functions, suggesting that the content with which they communicate and the people with whom they interact are not as signifiing.Among the classifiers studied, we find that the classifier Maximum Entropy performs better than the rest when NB SV RF ME works."}, {"heading": "Catalonia", "text": "Timeline.940.954.955.944 Interactions.841.935.960.946 Favorites.919.932.923 Network.957.970.965.972"}, {"heading": "Basque Country", "text": "Timeline.598.867.846.831 Interactions.799.826.857.842 Favorites.567.819.810.784 Network.889.881.885.903"}, {"heading": "Scotland", "text": "Timeline.595.789.742.724 Interactions.620.727.803.779 Favorites.546.754.724.720 Network.588.828.830.849TABLE 2: Ranking for Catalonia, the Basque Country and Scotland.

(Maximum Entropy with network features) broken down by national identity. We observe how the number of Twitter accounts, which are remarkably high for both national identities in Catalonia and Scotland, decreases significantly on Twitter, while Twitter accounts are most likely for Spanish identity and the British in Scotland. To further understand the results, we look at the characteristics and their distribution across national identities. Table 4 shows the top keywords for each territory and national identities extracted by users. The top keywords are extracted by using the Kullback Leibler Divergence as a metric for calculating the most important keywords of each national identity versus their national identity. The list of top keywords indicates that few of them are actually related to their national identity or the Basque Country."}, {"heading": "6 BEHAVIOURAL ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY GROUPS", "text": "In order to understand behavioural patterns that characterise the different national identity groups, we make pairs of comparisons with Welch's t-Test [10]. With two different user groups per case (pro-independence and anti-independence), we tend to determine which of the tweets is more prominent for a particular function and the statistical significance of this prominence. Results of this analysis are presented in Table 5, with a series of 16 characteristics grouped into 2 types. Regarding the independence of users in Scotland, we observe that there is no uniform pattern of who has more tweets or retweeted more (# 1 to # 6), with users of independence in Catalonia being more active and users of independence being more active in Scotland and both users being more active in various aspects of the Basque Country. It is interesting to look at the URLs these users post in their tweets (# 7 and # 8)."}, {"heading": "7 DISCUSSION", "text": "The methodology described here enabled us to collect large sets of data to tackle the unexplored task of determining Twitter users \"attitudes towards independence movements, as well as a classifier that can automatically determine this attitude. Our methodology and classifiers have been tested in three territories with persistent independence movements and conflicting national identities: Scotland, Catalonia and the Basque Country. Our classification experiments show encouraging results with high performance values ranging from 85% to 97% accuracy using a maximum entropy classifier that exploits each user's social network. In addition, and in a realistic scenario, the classifier trained by users whose self-reported location field reveals their national identity can be applied to other users in that particular territory. Classification of users by national identity can then be used for further analysis of social and political issues, as well as for targeting the user's own interests."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was supported by the PHEME FP7 project (grant number 611233)."}], "references": [{"title": "Towards real-time, country-level location classification of worldwide tweets", "author": ["A.
