Relational Data Mining (RDM)", "text": "Relational Data Mining (RDM) [1] refers to hierarchies, entities, granularities in relational knowledge extraction databases. In the current context, approaches mostly focus on aggregation for clustering or discovery of association rule applications [1] based on the unmonitored learning paradigm. Guo and Viktor [6] have proposed an improvement in the construction of artificial neural network classifiers, which also begin with an aggregation stage. In general, the RDM approach aims at creating higher hierarchical concepts by collecting lower attributes related to them [1,6]. These approaches propose automatic transformations directly from a database, without taking into account other domain characteristics that are different from transformations, in order to capture temporal relationships in credit risk analysis [2]. Aggregation can be considered an operation that summarizes a set of values most likely to be related to numerical modes, most commonly used in the case of statistical distribution (7)."}, {"heading": "B. Granular Computing (GrC)", "text": "Granular Computing (GrC) [4] is another field of research that also deals with the alteration of granularity in relational databases. It builds hierarchical concepts at the higher level by collecting attributes at the lower level that focus on either clustering or the discovery of association rules [4], i.e. on unsupervised learning. However, Granular Computing mainly uses coarse set theory and fuzzy logic as tools to achieve its goals. It must be stressed that it differs from the approach proposed here in two main aspects: no supervised optimization and no embedding of the concept in a single lower attribute. Generally, Granular Computing can be regarded as a field of multidisciplinary studies that makes use of theories, methods, techniques and tools that use the granularity process in the problem-solving process [12]."}, {"heading": "C. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)", "text": "Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) [5] is a very high degree of abstraction approach that, if properly adapted to very specific conditions, could lead to structures similar to RDM and GrC. It is a branch of applied mathematics and provides a framework called grid of concepts (based on sub-orders) that depicts the relationships between objects and values of attributes in diagrammatic format. These structures can be used in data mining tasks [13,14] and make the search space explicit in classification methods. However, the benefits of using conceptual networking come with costly construction and manipulation [15] in a grid that grows exponentially in relation to the formal context composed of objects, attributes, attribute values and incidence relationships. Furthermore, it is a very broad approach and there are no clear ways to optimize concepts in a uniformly monitored learning process."}, {"heading": "D. Weighted Granularity Transform (WGT)", "text": "Recently, a new approach to granularity modification, inspired and tested by educational problems, was proposed, an approach based on the knowledge of human experts to perform the granularity transformation [3], which is referred to in this paper as Weighted Granularity Transformation (WGT). Human experts arbitrarily set weights for each category of the attribute to express their propensity to the binary target in such a way as to produce a monotonous mapping of inclination. For example, the weights for the distribution of faculty formation in school were arbitrarily determined as w (PhD) = 4, w (MSc) = 3, w (MBA) = 2 and w (BSc) = 1, maintaining only an ordering relationship according to specialized knowledge. The attribute transformation was the weighted sum of the relative frequencies of the lower categories in a single continuous scalar indicator."}, {"heading": "TRANSFORM (RGT)", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "Metrics Approaches Mean Std.Dev.
