INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "The two most related works to our work are two works by Bhattacharyya and Dey [3, 10]. The first work [3] provides an analysis of the spatial complexity of streaming algorithms for some voting rules for individual winners. The second work [10] provides an analysis of the number of samples sufficient to approximately calculate the winner according to different voting rules for individual winners, and is important to our work as our algorithms are based on random samples. Another related work is that of Filtser and Talmon [13], which provides efficient protocols for determining the winner in distributed streams. We stress that while the above work deals with voting rules for individual winners, our work deals with multi-winning voting rules that select a committee of fixed size.Another noteworthy work line deals with the development of streaming algorithms for the Max Cover problem. In the Max Problem, we are given a collection of sets and a set to cover the universe."}, {"heading": "2. PRELIMINARIES", "text": "We provide preliminary results on elections and proportional representation, streaming algorithms and electoral flows and mention some useful results from probability theory.

(For simplicity of representation we refer to the voters as female voters, while the candidates are male.) In this paper we consider two types of elections: in elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections then we are elected based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections based on elections v, the ranking of elections based on elections based on elections, the ranking of elections based on elections."}, {"heading": "2.2 Vote Streams", "text": "We assume that the number of Candidate C is known and that the voters v1,.., vn arrive (i.e., vote) one at a time. Formally, we could say that in due course t [n], voter vt arrives; it is important that each voter arrives only once. We are interested in randomly selected algorithms that work with such voting streams and find approximate solutions. The following definition is critical to our idea of approximation. - Definition 1 (Committee that is highly likely to win) A committee of size k wins when it is either a winning committee, or it can become a winning committee by changing a maximum of two votes. - Specifically, we require that the committees calculated by our streaming algorithm are highly likely to win. - Such a streaming algorithm that is highly likely to identify a committee that is highly likely to win, or a winning committee by changing at most one number of votes is highly likely to nominate a streaming algorithm \u2212 a high-probability algorithm."}, {"heading": "2.3 Useful Results from Probability Theory", "text": "Since our algorithms are randomly selected, especially on the basis of a small number of voters, we make extensive use of the following variant of Hoeffding's inequality, which increases the probability that the sum of a given set of random variables deviates from its expectation. Theorem 1 (Hoeffding's inequality [14]) Let X1,..., Xt be independent random variables, so that 0 \u2264 Xi \u2264 m for each i [t]. Let X be a random variable, so that X = \u0445 i [t] Xi. Then the following two statements apply. (1) Pr [X \u2212 E [X] < (2) Pr [X] \u2212 X < (2) Pr [X] \u2212 X < (\u2212 2tm2) In the special case, if m = 1, Hoeffding's inequality is simplified as follows."}, {"heading": "3. RESULTS", "text": "Our main findings are summarized in Table 1.

Evidence shows that, with a high probability, even a winning committee for the election corresponding to the sample has a fairly high value throughout the entire election. The algorithm works as follows: We select a sample of t = 6k logm voters who are randomly selected, then we find a winning committee of sampled voters (in terms of Approval-CC) and return it as the winning committee for the entire election. We show that a winning committee of sampled voters is highly likely."}, {"heading": "3.2 Lower Bounds", "text": "We start by showing that each streaming algorithm uses a space that is linear in the number of candidates.
