Social network Twitter is the fastest growing medium of interpersonal communication, visible on the public Internet and often cited by other media [24]. Sentiments are explored in tweets related to the 2010 Vancouver Olympics [10], a major earthquake in Japan in 2012 [20], the 2011 Spanish parliamentary elections and the 2012 U.S. presidential elections [1]. Positive, consolidation speech is part of a multi-faceted peace process [28]. It contributes to the construction of a culture of peace to replace a structure of violence."}, {"heading": "Relevant Work", "text": "In our case, data is collected from conflict zones in Kenya, where tweets clash along ethnic / religious lines. In this context, positive speech helps build bridges between two different populations or find common ground between different opinions. Therefore, consolidation is an important topic of positive speech. Documentary accounts of reconstruction efforts are also part of positive speech. Expressions of grief and mourning for all victims represent another important type of positive speech in the given context, as well as speech that directly counteracts hate speech. The following tweet is considered a positive speech: We must be united beyond the boundaries of religion. [XX] Sh3 million celebrated for the reconstruction of the Gikomba market Dont! Be kind, Life is unpredictable!"}, {"heading": "Semantic Analysis of Positive Speech", "text": "We worked with four sets of data collected in Kenya by UMATI Project. Each set of data was captured by a violent episode: a grenade attack on a popular market in Gibraltar (1 - 482 tweets), a conflict between ethnic and religious groups in Mandera (2 - 1156 tweets), an attack on a Muslim cleric (3 - 300 tweets), a conflict between ethnic and religious groups in Mpeketoni (4 - 106,300 tweets). Our first task was to identify and extract the tweets written in English. We used Lingo's Language Identification 7 and Apache's Langes for this task. Our next task was to find unique tweets. We did not know why these multiple tweets appeared in the data, e.g. we knew that all re-tweets were presented."}, {"heading": "Topic Modeling by Latent Dirichlet Allocation", "text": "These approaches also include advanced results in these approaches a group of topics learned from the Raw (ex. Term Pocket) representation of the text. The document is based on a more comprehensive representation of the text based on the projection into the theme space. These approaches include the topic Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and its probable version, probable Latent Semantic Indexing. A more comprehensive approach is based on the latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. These approaches include the topic Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and its probable version, probable Latent Semantic Indexing. Each document is presented as a probability distribution over some topics, while eachtopic is represented as a number of words. LDA is an unsupervised machine learning technique that finds latent topics in large document collections.

In each repetition, a word-vector model was wasted on all the data and the complete data set would then be vectorized using some of the features described above. The resulting matrix was divided into training and test sets according to a 5x cross-validation and passed on to a linear regression classifier (LR) and a support vector machine (SVM) The resulting accuracy, precision, recall and f-score for the minority class were all recorded positive results for each of the 25 overall runs. The experiment was repeated for different sets of features and different datasets. We used the classification system of scikit-learn toolkit 11.11http: / scikit-learn.org / stable / Due to the nature of Kenyan datasets, positive speech is extremely rare (as low as a few percent of the update sets) and found such tweets a challenge for both a human and a classifier."}, {"heading": "Classification of Publicly Available Data", "text": "Data set 12 contains 1.6 million tweets containing emoticons on a variety of subjects from gadgets, products, people and events; the tweets were labeled according to the positive, negative or neutral mood conveyed by the emoticons; emoticons were later removed from the tweet; a small, hand-labeled test set was provided; we randomly extracted subsets of 0.1% (1600 tweets), 1% (16,000) and 10% (160,000) from the full data set and conducted the classification experiment in the same way as described above; the random sample of tweets previously labeled as data sets was conducted with care to maintain the original balance of the data (50 / 50); the qualitative dependence of the f-score on the behavior of the f-score for different features of the data set is similar to the data sets found in Kenyan data."}, {"heading": "Discussion and Future Work", "text": "In this study, we presented a method for analyzing positive speech on Twitter. Although it takes place on Twitter, positive speech is severely underrepresented when data is collected from conflict zones (e.g. < 1% of the data collected).We demonstrated that, despite the severe imbalance, automated methods are able to identify and classify positive speech. We demonstrated that LDA can successfully identify major topics (i.e. factual information) in each of the data, as well as find and extract topics that are supported by a low number of tweets (i.e. positive speech, sarcasm).We compared N-gram-based text representation with a novel technique for displaying tweets as a vector based on distributed word models. In our experiments, N-grams performed better than distributed word models. To see the benefit of distributed word models, data sets of the order of 10 5 samples are required. There is also an interplay between the size of the labeled data and the dimensional representation of the word."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the UMATI project for providing the data sets.
