Faced with sentences from two drafts as input, the system delivers output in the format as (D1-1, D2-1, Modify, Surface), using sentence alignment to record the revision sites and use the revision type to record the revision purpose of the author. Figure 1 demonstrates the workflow of our approach. The sentence alignment approach in (Zhang and Litman, 2014) is first used to segment the essays into sentences and generate a sentence alignment forecast.Then, EditSequences are generated either using an LSTM network or by direct transformation from the predicted sentence alignment. The Seed EditSequences are then labeled by the trained sequence labeling model."}, {"heading": "3.2 Transformation between Revision and EditSequence Representation", "text": "In fact, it is a matter of a way in which people are able to unfold, and in which they are able to unfold."}, {"heading": "3.3 EditSequence Labeling and EditSequence Mutation", "text": "For our first hypothesis, we perform a sequencing on EditSequence and use RevType of the labeled sequence as the results of revision classification.

RevType part of the associated label is used as the revision type. Conditional Random Fields (CRFields) (Lafferty et al., 2001) is used for the labeling of each EditStep in the sequence (Zhang and Litman, 2015) are reused, the unigrams and three feature groups.Location group.

For the two different tasks of revision identification (revision location extraction and revision type classification), we transform the location representation into a revision operation format and insert it into a label along with the revision type. Thus, the two different tasks are transformed into a common sequence marking task. With this design, the probability of a labeled sequence indicates not only the likelihood of sentence matching, but also the likelihood of revision types. We use the mutation idea of genetic algorithms to iteratively update the labeling of sequences. LSTM is used to generate seed candidate edit sequences for mutation. Results show that our approach improves the performance of both tasks. In this paper, the effect of neural networks is limited by the data size. For the future work, we would like to fully investigate this larger revision approach on Lee in 2015."}], "references": [{"title": "Wikipedia vandalism detection: Combining natural language, metadata, and reputation features", "author": ["Luca De Alfaro", "Santiago M.
