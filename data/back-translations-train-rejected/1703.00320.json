Two widely-studied randomized mechanisms in multiagent settings are the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and the Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS). Both mechanisms require only that agents specify ordinal preferences and have a number of desirable economic and computational properties. However, the induced outcomes of the mechanisms are often incomparable and thus there are challenges when it comes to deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper, we first consider the space of general ordinal preferences and provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS. We analyze their respective economic properties under general and lexicographic preferences. We then instantiate utility functions with the goal of gaining insights on the manipulability, efficiency, and envyfreeness of the mechanisms under different risk-attitude models. Our results hold under various preference distribution models, which further confirm the broad use of RSD in most practical applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 14:42:20 GMT  (7325kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00320v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1503.01488"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1503.01488", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["hadi hosseini", "kate larson", "robin cohen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00320"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.00320.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Investigating the Characteristics of One-Sided Matching Mechanisms Under Various Preferences and Risk Attitudes", "authors": ["Hadi Hosseini", "Kate Larson"], "emails": ["hhvcs@rit.edu", "klarson@uwaterloo.ca", "rcohen@uwaterloo.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this paper, we first examine the area of general ordinal preferences and provide empirical results on the (in-) comparability of RSD and PS.

Thus, we examine the properties of RSD and PS in the space of all possible preference profiles as well as the different preferences. Lexicon preferences are present in various fields of application and have been extensively studied in artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems as a means of assessing allocations based on ordinary preferences.

For each welfare function, we look at homogeneous populations of agents in which agents have the same risk settings but may have different preferences.

Substantial work in calculating social choices and machine learning will allow us to use these statistical models to capture the distribution of ranking preferences in a population of agents [8,30,31]. We will focus on Mallows models and Polya-Eggenberger Urn models (Urn) when the preferences of agent models are distributed around a reference ranking that is proportional to the removal of Kendall-Tau (KT) [25, 26]. Henceforth, preferences closer to the reference ranking will appear more likely in the population. In other words, agent preferences differ from the reference ranking with decreasing probability that rankings will move away from the reference. Mallows models are parameterized by a reference ranking and a dispersion ranking parameter (we use rankings in view of a form ranking)."}, {"heading": "8 Related Literature", "text": "Svensson showed that the serial dictatorship is the only deterministic mechanism that is strategically secure, but not in terms of efficiency [2].

However, if a designer urgently needs sd efficiency, then PS's theoretical results indicate that it is better than RSD. However, our results show that PS is highly susceptible to manipulation for various combinations of agents and objects. This manipulation and the potential gain from manipulation become more difficult especially when agents are risk averse and designers need to take this into account. On the other hand, while RSD theoretically does not guarantee sd efficiency, our results show that it tends to do quite well - sometimes even better than PS in terms of social welfare. RSD also has the added advantage of being sd-strategically secure, and is therefore not vulnerable to the manipulation problems of PS. Although the calculation of RSD probabilities (fractional assignments) is hard [6, 45], RSD is easy to put into practice."}, {"heading": "A Numerical Results", "text": "The following table shows the results of comparing RSD and PS under ordinal preferences for different combinations of agents and objects.

monetary transfers are not allowed. Two widely-studied randomized mechanisms in multiagent settings are the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and the Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS). Both mechanisms require only that agents specify ordinal preferences and have a number of desirable economic and computational properties. However, the induced outcomes of the mechanisms are often incomparable and thus there are challenges when it comes to deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper, we first consider the space of general ordinal preferences and provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS. We analyze their respective economic properties under general and lexicographic preferences. We then instantiate utility functions with the goal of gaining insights on the manipulability, efficiency, and envyfreeness of the mechanisms under different riskattitude models. Our results hold under various preference distribution models, which further confirm the broad use of RSD in most practical applications.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
