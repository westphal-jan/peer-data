A fundamental difference between smart cities and similar applications of technology in other areas, such as business, government or education, is the enormous variety of technologies used, the way in which they are applied by services and applications. Thus, the development of successful smart city solutions requires the collection and maintenance of relevant data in the form of IoT data. In recent years, eight industry-led projects have been funded by Innovate UK3 (the UK innovation agency) to deliver the IoT \"clusters,\" each centered around an aggregate and expose data feeds of several types of sensors.

In this way, the system administrator can add or remove a SPARQL endpoint at any time.

Currently, Greater Manchester lacks integrated, consistent route finding services that can be accessed through a variety of media, including digital and print. City Concierge aims to develop an urban user interface for the city region, integrating transport and visitor services that allow users to make informed decisions about the way they travel."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, the semantic enrichment of the BT Hypercat Data Hub was presented. Specifically, the BT Hypercat Ontology was introduced, which forms the basis for translating existing data into an RDF representation. In addition, the BT SPARQL Endpoint was implemented as a set of SPARQL endpoints and an additional endpoint, called the Federated SPARQL Endpoint, was provided to enable the execution of federated queries. In addition, several examples of federal queries illustrate how the BT Hypercat Data Hub can be connected to the LOD Cloud. Finally, two use cases illustrate the enhanced functionality of the system, highlighting the benefits of semantic enrichment. Future work will include further semantic enrichment of the implemented system. In particular, the current support for SPARQL queries can be extended to enable GeoSPARQL queries to provide direct access to spatial information currently available in the Data Hypercat Hub."}, {"heading": "A Appendix", "text": "The fact is that we are able to manoeuvre ourselves into a situation in which we are able, in which we are able to change the world in which we are able, in which we are in."}], "references": [{"title": "Hypercat 3.00 Specification, 2016", "author": ["Pilgrim Beart"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2016}, {"title": "The Semantic Web", "author": ["Tim Berners-Lee", "James Hendler", "Ora Lassila"], "venue": "Scientific American,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Ontop: Answering SPARQL queries over relational databases", "author": ["Diego Calvanese", "Benjamin Cogrel", "Sarah Komla-Ebri", "Roman Kontchakov", "Davide Lanti", "Martin Rezk", "Mariano Rodriguez-Muro", "Guohui Xiao"], "venue": "Semantic Web,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2017}, {"title": "Jena: implementing the semantic web recommendations", "author": ["Jeremy J Carroll", "Ian Dickinson", "Chris Dollin", "Dave Reynolds", "Andy Seaborne", "Kevin Wilkinson"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 13th international World Wide Web conference on Alternate track papers & posters,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Smart cities\u2019 data: Challenges and opportunities for semantic technologies", "author": ["Mathieu d\u2019Aquin", "John Davies", "Enrico Motta"], "venue": "IEEE Internet Computing,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Internet of Things - Why Now", "author": ["John Davies", "Mike Fisher"], "venue": "Jnl Institute of Telecommunications Professionals,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2015}, {"title": "RDF Semantics", "author": ["Patrick Hayes"], "venue": "In W3C Recommendation,", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2004}, {"title": "OWL 2 Web Ontology Language: Primer", "author": ["Pascal Hitzler", "Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch", "Bijan Parsia", "Peter F.
