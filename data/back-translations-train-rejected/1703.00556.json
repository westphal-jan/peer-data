{"id": "1703.00556", "review": {"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Mar-2017", "title": "Conversion Rate Optimization through Evolutionary Computation", "abstract": "Conversion optimization means designing a web interface so that as many users as possible take a desired action on it, such as register or purchase. Such design is usually done by hand, testing one change at a time through A/B testing, or a limited number of combinations through multivariate testing, making it possible to evaluate only a small fraction of designs in a vast design space. This paper describes Sentient Ascend, an automatic conversion optimization system that uses evolutionary optimization to create effective web interface designs. Ascend makes it possible to discover and utilize interactions between the design elements that are difficult to identify otherwise. Moreover, evaluation of design candidates is done in parallel online, i.e. with a large number of real users interacting with the system. A case study on a lead generation site learnhotobecome.org shows that significant improvements (i.e. over 43%) are possible beyond human design. Ascend can therefore be seen as an approach to massively multivariate conversion optimization, based on a massively parallel interactive evolution.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 23:54:28 GMT  (2387kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00556v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 21:16:02 GMT  (2387kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00556v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 27 Mar 2017 18:30:16 GMT  (2387kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00556v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 30 Apr 2017 20:51:21 GMT  (2388kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00556v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["risto miikkulainen", "neil iscoe", "aaron shagrin", "ron cordell", "sam nazari", "cory schoolland", "myles brundage", "jonathan epstein", "randy dean", "gurmeet lamba"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00556"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.00556.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Conversion Rate Optimizationthrough Evolutionary Computation", "authors": ["Risto Miikkulainen", "Neil Iscoe", "Aaron Shagrin", "Ron Cordell", "Sam Nazari", "Cory Schoolland", "Myles Brundage", "Jonathan Epstein", "Randy Dean", "Gurmeet Lamba"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "KEYWORDS conversion optimization, e-commerce, interactive evolution, online evolution, design"}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, the development of web interfaces (i.e. web pages and interactions) that convert as many users as possible from casual browsers to paying customers is an important goal [1, 11]. While there are some well-known design principles, including simplicity and consistency, there are also unexpected interactions between the elements of the page that determine how well they convert. The same element, such as a headline, an image or testimonials, can work well in one context, but not in others - it is o en hard to predict the outcome, and it is even harder to decide how to improve a particular page. A whole range of information technologies has emerged in this area, called conversion rate optimization, or conversion science."}, {"heading": "2 BACKGROUND", "text": "This year, it will only take one year for an agreement to be reached."}, {"heading": "3 THE ASCEND METHOD", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight."}, {"heading": "4 CASE STUDY", "text": "As an example of how Ascend works, we consider a case study on how to optimize the web interface for a media page that connects users to online educational programs. The experiment was conducted from September to November 2016 on the desktop of the site. The initial design for this page is shown on one side of Figure 4. It was hand-designed using standard tools such as Optimism. The conversion rate during the time of the experiment was estimated at 5.61%, which is typical for such web interfaces. On the other hand, the web designers came up with nine elements, each resulting in 381,024 potential combinations."}, {"heading": "5 FUTUREWORK", "text": "Ascend has been applied to numerous web interfaces, and it has increased conversion rates by 20-200% compared to the hand-picked controls [13]. emain limitation is the human element: web designers, used to A / B and multivariate testing, try to minimize the search space, i.e. the number of elements and values that do not give evolution much room to explore and find powerful solutions. O n evolution discovers signal improvements in a few generations, and designers are eager to embrace them right away rather than optimize them."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "Sentient Ascend demonstrates how interactive evolution can be scaled by simultaneously testing a large number of real-world candidates; it incorporates technologies to keep exploration costs manageable and minimize the number of evaluations required; and from an application perspective, Ascend is the first automated system for massively multivariate conversion optimization - replacing A / B with AI - changing the subtle combinations of variables that lead to conversion improvements. e Web designers can spend more time trying out ideas and less time with statistics, giving them the freedom they need to achieve results."}], "references": [{"title": "Landing Page Optimization: \u008ae De\u0080nitie Guide to Testing and Tuning for Conversions (second ed.)", "author": ["Tim Ash", "Rich Page", "Maura Ginty"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Evolutionary Optimization in Dynamic Environments", "author": ["J\u00fcrgen Branke"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Neuroevolution: From Architectures to Learning", "author": ["Dario Floreano", "Peter D\u00fcrr", "Claudio Ma\u008aiussi"], "venue": "Evolutionary Intelligence", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Introducing an Age-Varying Fitness Estimation Function", "author": ["Babak Hodjat", "Hormoz Shahrzad"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Online Controlled Experiments and A/B Tests.
