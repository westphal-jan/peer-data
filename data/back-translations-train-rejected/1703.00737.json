RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Compressed Sensing", "text": "In [6], [7] it is also used for classifiable Xiv: 170 3.00 737v 1 [cs.L G] 2M ar2 017 of the frequency bands into white, grey and black sections. Such a separation depends on the spectral power density and shows at which sections of the frequency band a transmission without interference is likely. The aim of this method is to reduce the running time of the decision process as much as possible. Therefore, the calculation of the power density spectrum (PSD) is carried out using a compressed vector of input samples to compensate for the accuracy. The aim of this method is not to classify the available radio signals accurately, but to find spectral spaces that are sparsely used. A wavelength-based edge detector is used for this task. In contrast to our approach, compressed sampling promises faster runtimes and can fall back on samples that were recorded at a lower sampling rate than is helpful for deciding."}, {"heading": "B. Neuro-Fuzzy Signal Classifier", "text": "The NFSC [8] is an expert system that classifies frequency bands according to known wireless technologies. However, the purpose of the NFSC is similar to the proposed CNN. The performance of the two classifiers will be compared later. NFSC is divided into six different layers. However, the input of the first layer, the input layer, is the IQ samples of the signal. This layer calculates the PSD of the input. In the second layer, the layer of fusion, the PSD, is normalized to \u00b5 [n]. The first layer, the input layer, is the IQ samples of the signal min (P) \u2212 max (P). The second layer calculates the PSD P in dBm. In the third layer, the filter layer, the signal is filtered with a predefined filter shape. In the simplest case, the filter shape is a rectangle that is larger than the channel width of the radio signal, the signal is pre-classified by a filter layer."}, {"heading": "C. Convolutional Modulation Recognition", "text": "O'Shea et al. [9] compared the performance of different classifiers for the classification of 11 modulations, 8 digital and 3 analog modulations. The classifiers used were CNNs with different parameters, deep neural networks with different parameters, a decision tree, a naive bayes classifier, a k-next neighbor classifier, and a support vector machine. For this task, CNN achieved the best results for low signal-to-noise (SNRs). For high SNRs, the difference of all classifiers was comparable, except the na\u00efve bayes and a deep neural network with high regulation. O'Shea et al. examined the complex rated temporal radio signal domain, while in this paper the spectral radio signal domain is investigated. Nevertheless, there are many parallels in these areas and we have the CNN sample from O'Shea et al., which achieved the best results as a starting point for our work."}, {"heading": "III. GENERATION OF DATA SET", "text": "The training and validation data used were generated using the SMBV100A vector signal generator (VSG) from RHODE & SCHWARZ and the RSA6114A real-time spectrum analyzer (RSA) from TEKTRONIX. The measurement was triggered. Only data was recorded in which a radio signal was transmitted. For example, the interframe gaps in the signals were not recorded. Each packet sent by the VSG had the maximum allowable number of bytes as payload. The payload was randomly recorded. For the IEEE 802.11 b / g frames, the physical layer mode was varied between CCK, PBCC and OFDM, and each allowed bit rate for each mode.For the IEEE 802.15.1 frames, the transport mode between ACL, eSCO and SCO was varied, and different packet types were each used a cable type."}, {"heading": "IV. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK DESIGN", "text": "The design of the CNNs is aimed at classifying the radio signals. The radio signals are a complaint according to IEEE 802.11 b / g, IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.1 packet transmissions. Thus, CNN will classify the assigned frequency channel and the corresponding wireless technology.In order to meet realistic radio capabilities, CNN is limited to a sampling bandwidth of 10 MHz. Thus, to observe the entire 2.4 GHz ISM band, eight parallel classifiers are required. Therefore, a technology-specific relative channel number ROWT can be mapped to its absolute channel number ACHWT with the index nCNN {1, 2,..., 8} of the used CNN bandwidth: ACHWT = RCHWT + ROWT \u00b7 (nCNN \u2212 1) + AOWT (3) + IEWT (IEWT) with its absolute channel number IEWT receive frequency."}, {"heading": "A. Frequency-Domain Sensing Snapshots", "text": "The snapshot is limited to a duration of 12.8 microseconds and therefore consists of 128 IQ samples. It must be longer than the symbol durations of the radio technologies used for meaningful classification. At the minimum symbol duration applied of 1 microsecond, a single snapshot contains up to 12.8 symbols. Danev et al. [13] showed in emission-based radio detection that frequency-based features exceed their time-based equivalents. Therefore, the IQ samples are transmitted into frequency ranges using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The resulting snapshot contains 128 complex weighted frequency bins."}, {"heading": "B. Network Structure", "text": "The network structure of CNN is derived from O'Shea et al. [9], as in Tab. II. Therefore, the input data is a snapshot with complex weighted frequency bins, with the real and the imaginary part considered as independent floating-point values. Thus, the input data results in a 128 x 2 matrix. The output data size is a vector of length 15, as there are 15 classes to classify. Each entry of the vector has a value between 0 and 1 and describes how likely it is that the input data belongs to the class for which it stands in relation to the other classes."}, {"heading": "C. Network Training", "text": "For the training process, the Adam Optimizer [14] was used and the input data normalized; this optimizer showed the best results in the work of O'Shea et al. Standard parameters for the Adam Optimizer other than the learning rate were used; the learning rate for CNN was 0.0001; CNN was trained over 50 eras; this setup showed the best results with small parameter variations; no hyperparameter optimization was performed, but it could be done in the future to optimize the results; and a batch size of 1024 was used for the training, which was close to the limit of graphics card memory."}, {"heading": "D. Network Size Reduction", "text": "In practice, it is difficult to apply this rule, as it is not applicable, for example, if you also need to specify the number of snapshots to be used for training. As the size of the data set was determined by orientation to the work of O'Shea et al. [9], we then reduced the size of CNN so that it had roughly the same degrees of freedom as snapshots used for training. The idea of this rule is that CNN learns to extract and detect more reliable features in snapshots and does not attempt to learn random processes such as noise in the data, which should lead to a better generalization of CNN. The network structure of the reduced CNN is in Tab. II. The learning rate of the reduced CNN was 0.001, and it was trained for 200 epochs. A batch size of 1024 GD was used. The implementation of the reduced CNN device was implemented with the central unit 9U-16."}, {"heading": "V. RESULTS", "text": "The IEEE 802.11 b / g signals have the widest channel width and the most varied modulations and bit rates, making them the most complex signals for the classification problems studied, and the best accuracy is achieved for the various IEEE802.15.1 channels. RCHIEEE802.15.1 0 and 9 classes are deformed by the anti-aliasing filter, and the channel bandwidth of RCHIEE802.15.1 9 class overlaps with the channel bandwidth of E802.15.4 1 1 class. Classes RCHIEEE802.3 and 8 have a slightly inferior frequency class than IEE802.4. IEE802.3 and 8 classes have a slightly inferior frequency class than IEE802.4."}, {"heading": "A. Comparison of CNN and NFSC", "text": "The accuracy of the CNN was compared to the accuracy of the NFSC. Therefore, the filter and the reference form of the NFSC rectangles were used; the filter shape was twice as wide as the reference shape that had the channel bandwidth as width; a threshold of 0.5 was used for the similarity; for fair comparison, the classification of IEEE 802.11 b / g complaint signals was ignored due to suboptimal performance in identifying signals outside the band; the performance under such limitations of the NFSC compared to CNN is shown in Fig. 3. It is important to note that the resulting classification accuracies are averaged for all classes used. In the validation data applied, CNN performs better in classification accuracy independent of SNRs than the NFSC. CNN shows an average performance increase and an improvement in classification accuracy of at least 5.32 dB or 8.19%, respectively. Therefore, the data-based approach is limited to allowing CNN to independently capture the NFSC results during the SFSC."}, {"heading": "B. Frequency- and Time-Domain Sensing Snapshots", "text": "The CNN can be trained with either time or frequency snapshots. Therefore, the training was also performed with equally large time equivalents with squaring and imaginary components of the raw 128 IQ samples as a 128 \u00d7 2 input matrix. Classification accuracy with both frequency and timeDomain snapshots as input is shown in Figure 4. As expected, the frequency domain snapshots exceed the time equivalent, as the differentiation of the CNNs must be frequency selective in the first place."}, {"heading": "C. Reduced CNN", "text": "The accuracy of the training and validation data for both CNNs is shown in Fig. 5. Although the degrees of freedom for the small CNN have been significantly reduced, the accuracy of the validation data is similar. While, for training, the classification accuracy for the reduced CNN decreases especially at low SNRs, for validation, the performance of both CNNs is comparable. The difference in training performance shows that the original CNN stores the snapshot pattern including noise, while the reduced CNN generalizes much better."}, {"heading": "VI.
