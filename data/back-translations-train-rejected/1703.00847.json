Consider the five-node chain of generators shown in Figure 5 (I) (a). The dynamics of the chain are simulated using (2), and the input pin is considered a zero-mean correlated WSS process. Next, we apply the reconstruction method based on Vienna filtering (algorithm 1) to the initial data from the chain and obtain Vnl = {2, 3}, (3, 4)} and Vl = {1, 5}. The reduced graph T is shown in Figure 5 (I) (c). Applying the algorithm 3 to node T eliminates the false links involving leaf nodes and leads to ET = (1, 2), (2), (3), (4), (4), (4), (), (4), () and ()."}, {"heading": "VIII. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We are developing a three-stage algorithm based on Viennese filters to reconstruct the exact topology of a bidirectional radial network of dynamically related WSS processes. The advantage of our approach is that it does not use any prior information about the network other than the fact that the underlying topology is a tree. In particular, it is extremely useful in estimating the operational topology of the radial power grid by means of phase angle measurements of the oscillation equations. We illustrate the proposed algorithm using the example of a 5-node chain and also a modified tree version of the IEEE 39 bus test system."}, {"heading": "IX. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Authors S.

present a method to reconstruct the interconnectedness of dynamically related stochastic processes, where the interactions are bi-directional and the underlying topology is a tree. Our approach is based on multivariate Wiener filtering which recovers spurious edges apart from the true edges in the topology reconstruction. The main contribution of this work is to show that all spurious links obtained using Wiener filtering can be eliminated if the underlying topology is a tree based on which we present a three stage network reconstruction procedure for trees. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method developed by applying it on a typical distribution system of the electric grid.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
