Formal Definitions", "text": "A traffic network comprises a series of roads, as well as a series of nodes, each designated by N. \u2192 Nodes can be intersections of roads, exits of motorways, roundabouts, beginning-end points of a road, U-bends, etc. Nodes can be considered the most important points of the network, as these points can be important factors for changing traffic flows. To explain this, a traffic flow typically does not have to change significantly between two nodes, but it can change due to traffic lights, exit and so on. Consequently, almost all points of the traffic network and traffic sensors can be installed in the nodes. Definition 1 (Network points): In this study, we represent a road (roads, motorways, etc.) based on the nodes on that road. Each of these points can indicate the traffic condition (for example congestion)."}, {"heading": "B. Problem Definition", "text": "Suppose we have the historical network snapshots of a region (e.g. Northern California) obtained by traffic detectors at traffic points (definition 1).

In this thesis, we try to predict traffic flows in the latter region based on traffic patterns we learned from the former traffic network. Problem. Given the historical traffic observations of Network N1 and Snapshot (S, now), we predict traffic status from S (now + 1), where (now + 1) is the next time (e.g. traffic status in 20 minutes)."}, {"heading": "III.

Fig.2 illustrates the model during the training. As you can see, the inputs to this model are divided into two large groups, namely traffic conditions and incidents. Traffic conditions are the set of network snapshots (see definition 5). In other words, traffic conditions are as follows: Traffic conditions = Z'i = 1 SNAPSHOT (N, ti) Where Z is the size of the dataset selected for training the model, and SNAPSHOT (N, ti) is the network snapshot in each training post. In Fig.2, we have N points in our network N. For each network point at a given time, we need to show the snapshot (a 2D array with the size (n + m + 1))."}, {"heading": "B.

In this subsection we apply another method, the so-called Long-Short-Memory Traffic Flow (LSTM). [6] LSTM is a recursive neural network [4] with a more complex structure in the repetitive modules. In other words, each repetitive module contains 4 interacting layers, so that LSTM avoids the long-term dependency problem. Figure 4 shows an example of an LSTM module. In this work, as already mentioned, we try to predict the short-term future traffic state for a network point where we do not have the historical traffic state above it, based on traffic patterns we have learned from another road network. In view of the structure of the LSTM, our entire network is as in Figure 5. \u2212 In Figure 5, the traffic state of the point S (step two, we try to predict the S traffic at the second step, S traffic) and S (the second step) prior to the S traffic."}, {"heading": "IV.

CONCLUSION", "text": "Concepts of traffic bottlenecks and congestion are critical components of intelligent traffic network management systems. Great efforts have been made to understand how traffic flows and the short-term prediction of the occurrence of congestion due to peak times or incidents, such as car accidents or sporting events, can be useful for such systems to effectively control traffic and direct it to the most appropriate detours. Most traffic flow forecasting systems rely on the use of a central processing component, where the prediction is made by aggregating the information collected from all measurement stations. However, such systems are typically scalable and unable to provide real-time feedback to the system, while in a decentralized scheme each node is responsible for predicting its own short-term congestion of current local measurements in adjacent nodes. In this work, we introduced a scalable decentralized traffic forecast based on data flows, using a learning-based methodology developed from deep flows."}], "references": [{"title": "Sequential deep learning for human action recognition", "author": ["M.

We propose a decentralized deep learning-based method where each node accurately predicts its own congestion state in realtime based on the congestion state of the neighboring stations. Moreover, historical data from the deployment site is not required, which makes the proposed method more suitable for newly installed stations. In order to achieve higher performance, we introduce a regularized euclidean loss function that favors high congestion samples over low congestion samples to avoid the impact of the unbalanced training dataset. A novel dataset for this purpose is designed based on the traffic data obtained from traffic control stations in northern California. Extensive experiments conducted on the designed benchmark reflect a successful congestion prediction.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
