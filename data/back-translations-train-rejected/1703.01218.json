We set the bias for all players to 0. We found that any odd value of k produces games with strictly positive gain in the PSNE group. Therefore, for each value of relatives {1, 3, 5} and n in {10, 12, 15, 20}, 40 random LIGs were generated. For experiments with the local noise model, we used only n, which was set to the constant value of 0.01. For the global noise model, the parameters qg were set to 0.01, while the c capability was set to 0.01, while for the local noise model q1 = qn was set to the constant value of 0.06."}], "references": [{"title": "A continuation method for Nash equilibria in structured games", "author": ["B.
