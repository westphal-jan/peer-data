Introduction", "text": "There are many ongoing attempts to develop MT systems for various Indian languages that use rules-based as well as statistical approaches. As India is rich in linguistic divergences, there are many morphologically rich languages that differ from both English and the other. There is a great need for machine translation between them (Nair et.al, 2012). There are 22 planned languages written in 10 different scripts. This paper discusses various approaches used in the Indian language to improve the Indian MT systems, especially in Marathi, to Hindi statistical MT systems and vice versa, in order to improve the quality of machine translation."}, {"heading": "1.1 Challenge of Ambiguity", "text": "There are two types of ambiguity: structural ambiguity and lexical ambiguity."}, {"heading": "1.1.1.

Evaluation", "text": "We have tested the translation system with a corpus of 100 sentences from the \"EILMT Tourism Health\" corpus, as shown in Table 3. We have used various evaluation methods, such as subjective evaluation, BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR and TER (Agarwal and Lavie 2008), but we have attached importance to subjective evaluation to determine the fluidity (F) and adequacy (A) of the translation, since for morphologically rich languages subjective evaluations can provide more accurate results compared to other metrics. Fluidity is an indicator of correct grammatical constructions present in the translated sentence, whereas appropriateness is an indicator of the amount of meaning transferred from the source to the destination. Marathi Hindi bilingual experts have assigned values between 1 and 5 for each translation generated."}, {"heading": "5.

Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have focused mainly on the use of various lexical resources to improve the quality of machine translation. We have discussed the comparative performance of statistical machine translation with various lexical resources for both Marathi - Hindi and Hindi-Marathi. As discussed in the experimental section SMT, while the ability to handle rich morphology that can be overcome by using various lexical resources will help the machine improve the quality of translation, in our experiments we have used various metrics to evaluate BLEU Score, METEOR, TER and Fluency and Adequacy using subjective assessment. We can see that there is gradual growth in both Marathi-Hindi and Hindi-Marathi systems."}, {"heading": "7.
