However, from a behavioral point of view, we do not consider it useful to choose between games of chance that depend on an infinite number of variables. Since we will never know the actual outcome, games of chance will never really be paid out, and therefore any evaluation is essentially risk-free. Instead, we believe that it makes sense to consider only decisions between games of chance of finite structure: games that depend only on a finite number of variables. See De Bock et al.

As we have seen to define coherent selection functions on a linear space, we must provide them with a vector order. Similarly to what we have done before, we use the correct selection function on V (6) and the correct selection function on V (6).n To define coherent selection functions on a linear space, we must equip them with a vector order."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "We have shown that interchangeability evaluation is a particular indifference evaluation in which we identified the set of indifferent options. The main idea that enabled a (finite) representation is the linear order of isomorphism H-1n between the quotient space and the set of games of chance on counter vectors, suggesting that (endless) interchangeable selection functions can be represented by an election function that essentially represents preferences between urns with n-spheres of type X with different compositions. Alternatively, in the countable case we have shown that there is a polynomial representation. Selection functions form a belief structure (see Van Camp et al. (2017)). Therefore, each infimum of coherent selection functions is a coherent choreography. As each infimum of selection functions is compatible with some fixed epics, I can well expect that the selection functions are (Van Camp) compatible."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Gert de Cooman's research was partly financed by the project 3G012512 of the Flanders Research Foundation (FWO).
