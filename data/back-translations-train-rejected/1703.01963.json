Introduction", "text": "A Markov process can be used to model a random system that changes states according to a transition rule that only depends on the current state. And, the Markov property is the most important property during the Markov process, namely the conditional probability distribution of the future states of the process depends only on the current state [23, 32, 34]. Markov chain is a stochastic process with Markov property [11]. It is widely used in many applications to study sequential data [1, 2, 19, 43], especially in prediction [21, 39], economic forecasting [29, 41] and so on. The Makov chain is a powerful tool for examining sequential data. It provides a set of models for analyzing time series data and predicting the tendencies of random processes, including discrete time Markov chain (DTMC)."}, {"heading": "2.

Discrete-time Markov chain", "text": "Definition 2.1. let {Xn: n > 0} be a random sequence defined in the probability space. P represents a probability quantity which is a function from sentence F to the submission of the real number R. Each event in F receives a probability value from 0 to 1 by function P. For arbitrary n + N + and states i1, i2,.., if P {Xn = in, Xn \u2212 1 = in \u2212 1,..., X1 = i1} > 0 if satisfaction P {Xn + 1 = in + 1 | Xn = in,.., X1 = i1} = P {Xn + 1 | Xn = in} (1) then the random sequence {Xn > 0} is called the Markov chain. Eq. (1) the Markov state i."}, {"heading": "2.2. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory", "text": "Hard evidence theory has some outstanding problems, such as conflict management [16, 58], dependent evidence combination [53] and determination of basic probability mapping [28], it has broad applications such as error diagnosis [27], supplier chain management [13, 17], decision making [15, 22, 31, 38] and risk assessment, which play a major role in modeling and merging uncertain information due to their efficiency. Below are some basic concepts of D-S evidence theory. Definition 2.4. Let U denote a finite set consisting of the entire possible value of the random variable X. The elements of group U are mutually exclusive and U is referred to as a differentiating frame. Let 2U denote the power set of U, each element of which corresponds to a subset of the value of X.Definition 2.4. Let U denote a finite set consisting of the total value of the possible random variable X."}, {"heading": "2.3. Pignistic probability transformation", "text": "Since evidence theory assigns probability to all subsets of the decision frame, BPA usually refers to the probability mapping of a subset of several elements, not to a subset of a single element. It reflects the uncertainty of the real world. However, decisions are difficult to make by directly using BPA. BPA is normally converted into probability, and then the decision is made on the basis of probability. Pignistic probability transformation (PPT) is a classic method of achieving it by dividing the BPA of a multi-element set into individual sets. Definition 2.6. Let U specify the decision frame and m be a BPA on U. A pignistic probability transformation function Bet U \u2192 [0, 1] is defined as: Bet P (x) = x (A) = x (A), A (Um (A) | (9), where | A | is the cardinality of sentence A."}, {"heading": "2.4. Interval number", "text": "Definition 2.7. An interval number that is a + is defined as a = [a \u2212, a +] = {x | a \u2212 \u2264 x \u2264 a +}, where a \u2212 and a + the lower limit and upper limit are apparent, while x [0, 1]. Specifically, interval number a \u2212 degenerates into a real number when a \u2212 = a +. Definition 2.8. Let A = [a1, a2] and B = [b1, b2] be two interval numbers. Square the distance between two interval numbers D2 (A, B) is calculated by [55]: D2 (A, B) = 1 2 \u2212 12 {[(a1 + a2) 2 + x (a2 \u2212 a1)] \u2212 [b1 + x (b2 \u2212 b1) (212)"}, {"heading": "3. The shortcoming of DTMC model", "text": "This section provides a realistic example of the prediction of the DTMC models and their most important selection results. Table 1 is a statistic of the inability to predict the product E15 in 20 consecutive time periods. 21 time periods can be calculated by applying the traditional DTMC model. It is more likely that the prediction improbability acquires a transition period."}, {"heading": "4. The new belief Markov chain model", "text": "The integrated process of building the new faith Markov model is as follows: Step 1. Determine the state space on the basis of the previous data. Make sure that the number of states is rational and all states form the framework of the distinction U. Step 2. Calculate the BPA of the entire periods based on the power set of distinction 2U based on the distance between the interval numbers. Step 3. Calculate the one-stage transfer time of the faith assignment B Pij, i, j, 2 U based on the BPA obtained. And then the transition matrix [Pij] is built. Pij represents the transferability of the transferability from the position i to the proposition j: n \u2212 1 period of the transfer of the faith assignment B = 1 (i) t \u00b7 m (j) t \u00b7 m (j) t \u00b7 m (t) t + 1)."}, {"heading": "5. Numerical example", "text": "In this section, the inventory prediction problem in Section 3 is still taken as an example to show the effectiveness of our model. We assume that some uncertain information exists in the realistic statistics, some inventory demand data are applied in the form of interval numbers. Table 4 is a statistic of inventory demand for product E15 in 20 consecutive periods. Following the steps described in Section 4, the new belief Markov model can be applied to the prediction. As shown in Table 4, the inventory of the entire 20 periods extends in the interval number [137, 229]. All values can be classified into three basic states: low (L), medium (H) and high (H). They form the framework of the distinction U = {L, M, H}. Then the output of the frame is prostituted from {L}, {L}, {H} {H}, M}."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The main advantages of the new model are: 1. Stability. The sudden change in the prediction result is avoided, namely, that the prediction result changes smoothly along the slight change in data.2. The ability to deal with uncertain information. Either the uncertainty of the state or the data can be handled effectively in our model.3. Flexibility. The different state distribution schemes and basic probability assignment functions can lead to different outcomes. The setting can be adjusted according to the realistic situation that reveals the flexibility of our model.3. A numerical example of the prediction of stocks is illustrated in the paper to show the application of our model.And the prediction result and the comparison prove the effectiveness and rationality of our model."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 61671384), the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province (program no. 2016JM6018), the Fund of SAST (program no.

applied in many fields, especially the field of prediction. The classical Discrete-time Markov chain(DTMC) is a widely used method for prediction. However, the classical DTMC model has some limitation when the system is complex with uncertain information or state space is not discrete. To address it, a new belief Markov chain model is proposed by combining Dempster-Shafer evidence theory with Markov chain. In our model, the uncertain data is allowed to be handle in the form of interval number and the basic probability assignment(BPA) is generated based on the distance between interval numbers. The new belief Markov chain model overcomes the shortcomings of classical Markov chain and has an efficient ability in dealing with uncertain information. Moreover, an example of inventory prediction and the comparison between our model and classi\u2217Corresponding author at: School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi 710072, China.
