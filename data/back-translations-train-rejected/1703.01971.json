It is commonly used in practical life and is one of the most classic blurred information. In situations that are too complex or inaccurate to be accurately described with conventional quantitative expressions, it is convenient and useful to make a qualitative description. Generally, each linguistic variable corresponds to a blurred sentence. For example, these linguistic variables can be expressed in positive triangular blurred number [37] as Table 1. Practical, the concrete models used to represent the linguistic items are flexible and changeable. To apply the type of representation method depends on the realistic application systems and the opinions of domain experts.

In other words, an interval of faith is divided into the crisp ones, which are determined as follows: bet (Ai) = \u0445 Ai'Akm (Ak) | Ak | (12), where | Ak | denotes the number of elements in the set designated as cardinality.

An example of supplier selection serves to illustrate the detailed approach of our method and the result proves its accuracy sufficiently. Our new method is worth considering if the blurred data grows rapidly with the development of the system.

To address this issue, a new method was proposed based on interval data fusion. Our method follows the original way to generate classical basic probability assignment(BPA) determined by the distance among the evidences. However, the weights of criteria are kept as interval numbers to generate interval BPAs and do the fusion of interval BPAs. Finally, the order is ranked and the decision is made according to the obtained interval BPAs. In this paper, a numerical example of supplier selection is applied to verify the feasibility and validity of our method. The new method is presented aiming at solving multiplecriteria decision-making problems in which the weights of criteria or experts are described in fuzzy data like linguistic terms or interval data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
