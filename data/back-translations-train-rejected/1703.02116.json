Introduction", "text": "One of the world's leading causes of morbidity and mortality is coronary heart disease (CAD), which is diagnosed definitively through coronary angiography, an invasive procedure that can lead to severe complications [2], or through additional, often costly imaging procedures. Non-invasive blood tests using circulating metabolites [3] [4] could potentially minimize unnecessary testing and predict CAD with greater accuracy. However, previous research was mainly limited to classical regression-based methods [5] [6] and potentially did not fully exploit the dimensions and abundance of the data by taking into account interactions between metabolites. Supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods may be better suited to address these challenges, but have yet to be systematically evaluated in this context."}, {"heading": "2. Background", "text": "Metabolites are small molecules produced during metabolism or by microbes within the body [7]. Metabolites are the end products of gene expression, a process closely related to protein / enzymatic reactions, and therefore potentially provide a direct molecular reflection of the cellular milieu that leads to pathophysiological changes. Since circulating metabolites can first predict the presence of CAD by identifying metabolic disorders relevant to atherosclerosis (e.g. diabetes and insulin resistance [8]) [9]), blood metabolite measurements can plausibly reflect this chronic process and help predict the existence and stability of CAD. However, for selected metabolites that have been studied so far, the incremental benefit compared to routine clinical assessments is modest and limited to a few candidates measured by non-scalable methods."}, {"heading": "3. Methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Case and exposure definitions", "text": "We used data from the Clinical Cohorts in Coronary Disease Collaboration (4C) study (n = 3409), for which patients with acute or stable chest pain were recruited from four NHS hospitals in the UK. [11] Patients agreed to have their EHR taken and blood samples made available to them. We defined the presence of CAD as a > 50% stenosis [12] occurring in \u2265 1 coronary arteries, based on data from: a) coronary angiography reports and b) EHR evidence of previous coronary revascularization procedures (percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary bypass graft) recorded in the EHR. Participants who were unable to detect CAD were excluded. 256 metabolites were quantified for each participant using an NMR technique. Full details were published elsewhere [4] [Misvalue of mean metabolic units and zero]."}, {"heading": "3.3 Statistical methods", "text": "We derived the main component factors for the standardized metabolite values and selected the first six for analysis because they accounted for > 95% of the data variability, and then performed logistic regression for each of the main component analysis factors (PCA) -derived metabolite factors and multiple logistic regression including all six factors. Adjusted (age, gender, use of statins, hypertension) and non-adjusted models were Bonferroni-corrected (p < 0.05), we performed logistic regression using the lasso penalty, which was defined as the lowest error of a 50-fold cross-validation, we trained a random forest classifier using Gini impurity and 5,000 trees per group, and the initial cross-validation was performed for both the percentage of variables used per tree and the maximum tree depth. A second cross-validation was performed, estimating the large number of trees alone to be balanced to a maximum of 13, increasing the number of two trees to one."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "We identified 1474 patients with metabolomias who were diagnosed with CAD (Table 1)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Comparison of model predictiveness", "text": "In the unadjusted models, the random forest classifier had the highest AUC and accuracy values, as well as the highest ROC curve (Figure 1), and both ML models performed better than PCA regression (Table 2). AUC, rough accuracy and PPV were largely similar in the models. All models showed significantly higher sensitivities than specificity, but PCA regression showed the most extreme values, as it correctly predicted the vast majority of positive CAD cases, but almost none of the negative CAD cases. The large discrepancy in sensitivity and specificity of the other two models shows that they could not accurately distinguish disease states. When confounders were taken into account, PCA regression showed the best accuracy, but higher AUC and accuracy values compared to unadjusted models were observed in all models."}, {"heading": "4.2 Model compositions and predictive metabolites", "text": "Logistic regression: In the individual metabolites, strong CAD associations after bonferroni correction were associated primarily with lipids (e.g. HDL and VLDL), apolipoprotein A-I, the ratio of triglycerides to phosphoglycerides and the ratio of omega-6, monounsaturated fatty acids to total fatty acids. With logistic regressions to individual PCA-derived factors, the first PCA factor (VLDL, ratio of apolipoprotein A-I, ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A-I, 0.404 variance) remained statistically significant."}, {"heading": "5 Concluding discussion", "text": "While ML predicts the presence / absence of CAD in the unadjusted models (using metabolite data only) with high accuracy / sensitivity, they have been exceeded in cleansing confounders from PCA regression in terms of ROC AUC and accuracy, suggesting that a small number of metabolites can potentially be included in predictive models. Several individual metabolites found to be statistically significant are consistent with prior literature and our pathological understanding of CAD and its development, including atherogenic lipid particles such as LDL, which are known to be causally associated with atherosclerosis, while others such as creatine reflect kidney function and are also established markers of CAD risk. Several other metabolites have not previously been associated with CAD, including phenylalanine and lactate, and potentially represent new avenues for investigation."}], "references": [{"title":
