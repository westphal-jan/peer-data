Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) fulfills these conditions. First, we briefly recapitulate the foundations of DEL according to the Conventions of Bolander and Andersen [8]. New in this presentation are mainly the parts on perspective shifts in Section 2.2. We will now define epistemic languages, epistemic states and epistemic actions.

For example, Anne is the one who puts the key under the mat, and Bob is the one who takes it off the mat. In order to represent who executes which measures of a plan, we will introduce what we call an owner function (inspired by the approach of Lo Lions, Pacuit and Witzel [22]).

Let's transfer this notion to the DEL-based setting of this paper. In our setting, the result of executing an action sequence in a state s a is given as s a.

Instead, some problems can be elegantly solved by modelling all kinds of communications directly as plannable actions and relying on the ability of autonomous actors to blame each other (by shifting perspectives) by achieving implicit coordination between actors. We have briefly shown that both sequential and conditional solution algorithms and their performance need to be formalized on the Russian card problem and two-letter transgression problems. Based on this paper, a number of challenging problems need to be addressed. First, concrete problems (e.g. epistemic versions of established multiactive planning tasks) need to be formalized, with special attention to what types of communicative actions actors need to solve these problems in an implicitly coordinated way."}], "references": [{"title": "A Translation-Based Approach to Contingent Planning", "author": ["Alexandre Albore", "Hector Palacios", "Hector Geffner"], "venue": "Proc.
