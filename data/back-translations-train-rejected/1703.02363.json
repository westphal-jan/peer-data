Commonly, they provide quantitative services, such as personalized training instructions or the counting of distances. But qualitative monitoring and assessment is still missing, e.g., to detect malpositions, to prevent injuries, or to optimize training success. We address this issue by presenting a concept for qualitative as well as generic assessment of recurrent human motion by processing multi-dimensional, continuous time series tracked with motion sensors. Therefore, our segmentation procedure extracts individual events of specific length and we propose expressive features to accomplish a qualitative motion assessment by supervised classification. We verified our approach within a comprehensive study encompassing 27 athletes undertaking different body weight exercises. We are able to recognize six different exercise types with a success rate of 100% and to assess them qualitatively with an average success rate of 99.3%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 12:57:01 GMT  (566kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02363v1", "Summitted for the 25th European Signal Processing Conference, 6 Pages, 5 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Summitted for the 25th European Signal Processing Conference, 6 Pages, 5 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["andre ebert", "michael till beck", "y mattausch", "lenz belzner", "claudia linnhoff popien"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.02363"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.02363.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Qualitative Assessment of Recurrent Human Motion", "authors": ["Andre Ebert", "Michael Till Beck", "Andy Mattausch", "Claudia Linnhoff-Popien"], "emails": ["andre.ebert@ifi.lmu.de,", "michael.beck@ifi.lmu.de,", "andy.mattausch@ifi.lmu.de,", "belzner@ifi.lmu.de,", "linnhoff@ifi.lmu.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We follow a concept for a qualitative and generic evaluation of athletes by developing multidimensional, continuous time series with motion sensors.

AN APPROACH FOR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF HUMAN MOTION", "text": "Below, we explain our progress in extracting recurring events from multidimensional time series, and then describe the pre-processing and selection of meaningful features to prepare a qualitative assessment through supervised learning. Data input from our segmentation process consists of 30 different, continuous flows of motion sensor data, as proposed in [3]. Therefore, five sensor devices capture acceleration and rotation information in X, Y and Z dimensions. Two are attached to the knuckles of the person being carried, two to the wrist and the fifth is worn in combination with a processing unit on the chest."}, {"heading": "A. Preprocessing and segmentation", "text": "To filter the individual events out of the incoming multidimensional signal set, we need to develop a dynamic and multipeak-based segmentation algorithm that is capable of segmenting heterogeneous motion sequences; the individual segments of the individual segments can each have a certain length and contain all the information about exactly one particular event; the individual segments of the individual segments are also of individual temporal length; in order to identify individual motion events, we must first examine the most significant signal vector within a signal. Typically, this signal contains the highest dynamics and variance within its values and enables a segment to be uniquely identified. S1 Starting point ts1 and its endpoint te1. To do this, we are able to calculate the standard deviation of all signals, where X is defined as the current signal."}, {"heading": "B. Feature selection and labeling", "text": "In fact, a feature vector within machine learning scenarios consists of a fixed number of features that describe an instance. Due to the fact that all of our activity segments are of individual length and consist of 30 individual signals, this problem is challenging. If we use the segmented time series directly to create features, their length would have to be trimmed or interpolated to achieve the specified length of a feature. Interpolation would lead to unwanted artificial noise, trimming could lead to the loss of important information and, finally, any previous efforts to create a segment of individual length would be worthless. In addition, an event of data collection that we have recorded for evaluation (see Section IV), consists of 3455 sample values on average (about 155 per signal)."}, {"heading": "IV. EVALUATION", "text": "In this section, we first describe the structure of our study. We then present the results of our evaluation and provide insights into the performance of the segmentation algorithm."}, {"heading": "A. Dataset", "text": "For the evaluation, we recorded a data set of six body weight exercises (crunches (cr.), lunges (lu.), jumping jack (j.j.), mountaineering (m.c.), bicycle crunches (b.c.) and squats (sq.), performed by 27 athletes, male and female, aged 20 to 53. Each athlete had to complete 3 sets of 20 repetitions of each exercise; a compulsory break of 30 was scheduled between each set. Athletes were shown an instruction video for each exercise and before it was performed. In total, we tracked movement data from 7,534 individual repetitions of exercises - in addition, all the exercises performed were recorded on video for later labeling by experts. The labeling range is 1 (very good) to 5 (very bad). The data is labeled as follows: All exercises were initially labeled with class 1 for each error (any specific deviation from the video instructions), e.g. small steps are added to the overall errors (the 0.5 points are missing)."}, {"heading": "B. Qualitative motion assessment", "text": "All in all, we used two different classification approaches for supervised learning, one with 1) manual and one with automated hyperparameter optimization. Within 1) we manually configured four popular classification algorithms for the detection of human activity (see Section II): the decision tree driven Random Forest (RF) and C4.5, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and the Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm. Table Ipresents the performance of manual classifier selection within a 10-fold cross validation. RF delivers the best results with an average correct classification rate of 89.7% and takes 447 ms to build its evaluation model. NB performed much faster, but with worse results. Approach 2) facilitates Auto-WEKA as a hyperparameter optimization layer for the automated selection of suitable classifiers and hyperparameter tuning models."}, {"heading": "C. Segmentation results", "text": "Overall, we were able to extract 7,413 of 7,534 recorded motion events using the segmentation approach described in Section III-A into individual segments of specific length, representing a total of 98.4% of the extracted events."}, {"heading": "D. Activity recognition", "text": "In our preliminary study in [3], the automated detection of eight different body weight exercises was evaluated on the basis of acceleration data. In this work, our feature vectors are based on standard deviations of the individual acceleration and rotation signals and not on time series with a fixed and significantly longer length. We applied this new design to our data set (see Section IV-A) and achieved a correct detection rate of 99.9% for the manual classification configuration (RF). In automated hyperparameter optimization within a 10-fold cross validation, 100% was achieved - the training of the evaluation model took 4.9 s for 7,413 cases. Compared to our previous studies and related approaches, this performance can be considered state of the art in the field of complex human motion detection [5], [9]."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we presented a generic approach to dynamically and individually segmenting recurring human motion events as well as qualitatively assessing complex human movements. For evaluation, we recorded an exemplary dataset of 7,534 repetitions of six different body weight exercises and extracted them into multi-dimensional segments of individual length. In addition, all segments received a quality label. We are able to estimate a generic quality class of an individual event with an average correct classification rate of 99.3% and up to 100% for individual exercise types by adjusting an expressive and highly compressed trait vector. For the mere detection of activities, we actually achieve a correct classification rate of 100%. Automatic optimization of hyperparameters yielded significantly better results than manual approaches. Our concept features a generic analytical approach and we suspect it may be applicable to different recurring human movements and may be optimized for various areas of work, such as medical observation or even."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Smartphone applications designed to track human<lb>motion in combination with wearable sensors, e.g., during phys-<lb>ical exercising, raised huge attention recently.
