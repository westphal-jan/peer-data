This motorway connects the city of Grenoble from the north-east to the south-west. In addition to maintaining local traffic, it plays an important role as it connects two motorways: the A480, which runs from Paris and Lyon to Marseille, and the A41, which runs from Grenoble to Switzerland. Furthermore, the mountains around Grenoble prevent the development of new roads, and they also have a negative impact on the spread of pollution, which makes the problem of traffic regulation on this road even more crucial. From the traffic control centre of DIR CE1, operators can monitor the development of interpartementale of the Centre-Esttraffic route, including the South Ring, although hundreds of surveillance cameras, verbal reports (mainly from road users, but also from other emergency services), emails and other text messages, and data from sensors placed on the road."}, {"heading": "3 Event-driven Congestion detection and forecasting", "text": "Specific behaviors of variables that describe the system, such as speed, density, occupancy, allow us to infer the presence of traffic jams. In the following, we will apply a Complex Event Processing2http: / / www.aimsun.com / (CEP) approach, sometimes referred to as event processing, which is a method that combines data from multiple sources for tracking and analyzing (processing) information streams (data) to derive events or patterns that suggest more complicated circumstances. The goal of complex event processing is to identify significant events (such as opportunities or threats) and respond to them as quickly as possible [21]. Generally, there are two methods for defining the rule patterns for an CEP application: machine learning and domain experts. In the first case, the patterns are learned automatically by a computer program, while in the second case, they are reproduced by an external entity; the specialized domain is also capable of combining the two."}, {"heading": "3.1 Machine learning for event definitions", "text": "In order to effectively learn definitions of traffic congestion using sensor data, we have developed OSL\u03b1 [22], an online structure learner for Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) [30].

Now, we describe an intelligent method for controlling or avoiding congestion. A cause of congestion is related to overdemand for the use of road infrastructure, and such demand can be met by ramp measurement. In view of a number of equipped ramps, the goal is to intelligently regulate the input flow and avoid congestion in order to get back into the arterial network. We adopt a hierarchical approach that splits the controller into distributed, local feedback loops and an event-based coordination scheme at the highest level (see Figure 3). Existing solutions are used for local feedback laws, but a new coordination scheme is proposed to deal with non-monotonous effects in traffic dynamics. In other words, local feedback laws are sufficient for monotonous traffic, but the coordination scheme is not necessary."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data-driven System Identification", "text": "In order to understand how non-monotonous effects affect the problem of ramp measurement, it is necessary to briefly review the dynamics of road traffic. Traffic conditions on motorways at a given location can be described by the traffic density \u03c1 (t), measured in the number of vehicles per kilometer, and the (main) traffic flow \u03c6 (t). The first order traffic model Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) [20] postulates a static flux density relationship, which is called a fundamental diagram. It is common to assign the LWR model a piecemeal fundamental diagram, a shape confirmed by real data but with significant differences (see Fig. 4). This spread is most notable at and above the critical density (density value corresponding to the maximum flow) and could be caused in part by a dependence of the flow on other variables."}, {"heading": "4.2 Low-level Control", "text": "The main objective of low-level control is to maximize local traffic flows by shifting the local traffic density q q towards the critical density, which is sufficient for near-optimal performance on a monotonous highway. It can be achieved with the successful ALINEA algorithm [24], where AI is the integral gain chosen in [24] and r-k (t-1) is the ramp flow quantity measured during the last scanning period. The only road parameter used by the Feedback Law is the critical density estimated online from the data as outlined previously. However, the actual measurement rate is subject to certain limitations. Obviously, it is not negative and is limited by some constant maximum traffic flows."}, {"heading": "4.3 Ramp Coordination", "text": "The aim of the coordinated ramp measurement is to address inefficiencies resulting from limited space on the ramps combined with the non-monotonous behavior of an overloaded bottleneck. In the spirit of the proposed platform's proactive approach, it is necessary to predict congestion. As described in Section 3, we forecast congestion through learning patterns from historical, large datasets. Then, the efficiency of the coordinated ramp measurement scheme is mainly applied to the accuracy of predictions made by CEP, while the coordination algorithm can be described as a simple state machine that responds accordingly. Assimilation in Fig. 6a, the local feedback law described in Section 4.2 controls either local density or both."}, {"heading": "5 Dashboard design", "text": "While automatic forecasting and decision-making address the challenges associated with congestion and the spotlight, road, transport and transport stakeholders are called upon to monitor and manage many other aspects of the road network. Consequently, it was important to manage the impact of road accidents in order to maintain public confidence in the work. The objectives of the Road Traffic Code are to maximise the available capacity of the road network, minimise the number of road users and maintain public transport."}, {"heading": "6 Proactive Event-driven system architecture", "text": "The event bus serves as a communication and integration platform for the runtime. Generally, inputs from operational systems (traffic sensor readings) are presented as events and fed into the system by sending a new event message to the event bus. These events are consumed by a complex event processing (CEP), the events derived from which represent detected or predicted situations, which are also sent to the event bus by the CEP component. The decision-making module listens to these events, so that decision-making is triggered by a new event that requires a decision. The outcome of decision-making represents the actions to be taken to mitigate or resolve the situation. These actions are posted as action events. The visualization component (dashboard) uses these events to control events from two sources: the situations (detected and predicted) and the corresponding actions that are proposed by the action component as action component, which is rejected as action component 13."}, {"heading": "7 Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we first evaluate our approach to learning the definition of traffic events using machine learning techniques, and then the various components of the proposed runtime platform."}, {"heading": "7.1 Learning Event Definitions", "text": "We applied OSL\u03b1 (see section 3.1) to traffic management using real data from the magnetic sensors mounted on the southern ring of Grenoble, while the results are 799 years old, consisting of about 3.3GiB of sensor measurements (monthly data). Furthermore, the traffic congestion notes are provided predominantly by human traffic controllers, but very sparsely. To deal with this problem, we also used a set of synthetic sets of data generated by the GTL traffic micro-simulator (see section 2).The synthetic data relate to the same location and consist of 6 simulations of one hour each (approximately 18.6MiB).A number of first-class logic functions is used to discredit the numerical data (speed, occupancy) and produce input events such as HappensAt (fast Slt55), 100), which represent the speed in the overtaking lane 53708."}, {"heading": "7.2 Event forecasting", "text": "To explore the quality of our CEP module, we conducted a test with 20 simulations generated by the GTL Traffic Microphone, along with congestion annotations.

Participants were asked to complete the Software Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire [4] for each dashboard. The SUS questionnaire consists of 10 simple questions about the potential benefits and benefits users feel the dashboard could offer them. Each statement is rated on a scale from 0 to 4. The evaluation of the answers then includes the subtraction of 1 from odd questions and the subtraction of rated questions from 5. This is because the questions alternate between positive and negative connotations.

It has been shown that the developed machine learning tool can match the performance of rules created by human experts, while complex event processing tools are able to predict traffic jams 3 to 4 minutes before traffic jams occur, even with uncertain and noisy data. The decision-making module using coordinated ramp measurement improves overall usage time compared to ramp measurement without coordination with the current local feedback algorithm ALINEA. It is worth noting that while the system is able to take proactive action to mitigate our ramp measurements, it does not show patterns arising from our patterns, but that other situations show backsliding patterns."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work is part of the EU-funded SPEEDD project (FP7-ICT 619435) and we thank Philippe Mansuy from DIR CE for the access to the control room on the southern ring road of Grenoble and valuable comments from road users."}], "references": [{"title": "Event Processing under Uncertainty", "author": ["A.
