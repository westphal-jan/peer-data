In this paper, we present a novel angle for studying word usage divergence -- word interpretations. We propose an approach that quantifies semantic differences in interpretations among different groups of people. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by quantitative evaluations. Experiment results indicate that divergences in word interpretations exist. We further apply the approach to two well studied types of differences between people -- gender and region. The detected words with divergent interpretations reveal the unique features of specific groups of people. For gender, we discover that certain different interests, social attitudes, and characters between males and females are reflected in their divergent interpretations of many words. For region, we find that specific interpretations of certain words reveal the geographical and cultural features of different regions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 14:51:09 GMT  (116kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02859v1", "4 pages, 1 figure, published at ICWSM'17"], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 18:31:22 GMT  (117kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02859v2", "4 pages, 1 figure, published at ICWSM'17"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 1 figure, published at ICWSM'17", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tianran hu", "ruihua song", "maya abtahian", "philip ding", "xing xie", "jiebo luo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.02859"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.02859.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A World of Difference: Divergent Word Interpretations among People", "authors": ["Tianran Hu", "Ruihua Song", "Maya Abtahian", "Philip Ding", "Xing Xie", "Jiebo Luo"], "emails": ["jluo}@cs.rochester.edu", "maya.r.abtahian@rochester.edu", "song.ruihua@microsoft.com", "phding@microsoft.com", "xing.xie@microsoft.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "As Pinker noted in his book (Pinker 2007), \"Language is the window into human nature.\" The differences between people, for example, gender (Coates 2015), age (Nguyen et al. 2013) and profession (Hu et al. 2016b) trigger their different use of words. These differences in word usage, in turn, reveal the unique characteristics of groups of people, such as their specific interests (Rakesh et al. 2014), personalities (Vinciarelli and Mohammadi 2014), etc. Previous work on the differences between people mostly focuses on the frequency of words. In this work, we go a step further to investigate the interpretation of words. Our results suggest that the interpretations of words may vary from person to person. More importantly, we discover that different word interpretations are also related to the unique characteristics of people who offer a novel perspective in order to understand the differences between social groups."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "It is reported that the typical male language uses more judgmental adjectives, elliptic sentences, directives, and \"I\" references, while the typical female language contains more intense adverbs, references to emotions, and insecurity verbs (Poynton 1989). People in different age groups seem to choose words differently. Nguyen et al. reported that older people, compared to younger people, talk more about family and work, and use fewer swear words in their language (Nguyen et al. 2013). Jobs also influence people's language patterns (Hu et al. 2016b). In the paper, the authors listed the most commonly used words in different occupations, and their results indicate significant differences in word usage between people of different occupations. Similarly, different cities may have different preferences in words (Cheng et al. 2016b), which reflect regional differences between people."}, {"heading": "Data Collection and Preprocessing", "text": "We collect our data set via the open Twitter APIs1. First, we set up two raw geo-bounding boxes, both of which are two degrees latitude long and two degrees longitude wide. One box is centered on NYC, and the other is centered on the Bay Area. We use the Twitter Streaming API to collect tweets from users who have posted 1https: / / dev.twitter.com / overview / apiar Xiv: 170 3.02 859v 2 [cs.C L] 28 March 201 7Tweets within these two ranges from June to October 2016, resulting in 0.4 million unique users. For each unique user, we download their maximum 3,000 current tweets using the Twitter Timeline API, resulting in approximately 0.2 billion tweets. To assign gender tags to each user, we use the Genderize.io2 API proposed in (Abbar, Mejova and Weber 2015)."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "Our approach consists of two steps: First, it learns group-specific interpretations for each word. Second, it quantifies the semantic distance between the interpretations. Without losing universality, we refer to the corpora of two groups of people as C1 and C2. These groups of people can be people of different genders, different regions, or any other kind of difference, and our approach can easily be extended to more than two groups."}, {"heading": "Group Specific Word Interpretations", "text": "To learn the word interpretations for two groups of people, we feed their corpora to an embedding model, and get a word vector space for each group. Therefore, with C1 and C2, we train two word vector spaces S1 and S2, respectively. Each space contains the semantic patterns of a group. Since words in an embedding space provide effective clues for understanding the words, we take these narrowest words as their interpretations. Therefore, for each word, we collect two sentences of its uppermost n words from S1 and S2, each along with the semantic similarities between these words, in order to understand w. We refer to such sentences as the interpretation of sets, those of I1w and I2w."}, {"heading": "Gender Divergent Words", "text": "In fact, in a country where most of them are women, people have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as men, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights to, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights to, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights to, they have the same rights to, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights to, they have the same rights as women, they have the same rights to, they have the same rights to, they have the same rights to the same rights as women, they have the same rights, they have the same rights to the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights to the same rights, they have the same rights to the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights to the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights, they have the same rights to"}, {"heading": "Regionally Divergent Words", "text": "In this section, we discuss words with divergent interpretations between NYC and the Bay Area. Differences between regions such as lifestyle (Hu et al. 2016a), eating habits and cultures (Silva et al. 2014) are described in many studies. In this work, we also manually review the top 100 regionally divergent words. We observe that there are mainly two types of regionally divergent words: one type reflects geographical differences and the other reflects cultural differences between regions."}, {"heading": "Geographical Differences between Regions", "text": "Place names make up a large part of this type of divergent words. These words include queens (Queens Borough, NYC), Jose (San Jose City, Bay Area), Castro (Castro District, Bay Area), buffalo (Buffalo City, NY State), etc. An interesting example of this type is Berkeley. In NYC, the word is referred to as the famous university and is closest to other famous universities such as Princeton, Cornell, Dartmouth, and Columbia. This word is more commonly interpreted as Berkeley City in the Bay Area, with narrowest terms such as Pasadena, Rockridge, Cerrito (all three are place names in the Bay Area). There are also words that are not place names but get geographical interpretations in certain regions. Bart, which means Bay Area Rapid Transit in the Bay Area, is a typical example. Its closest words in the Bay Area are train, muni (Muni Transit), subplots. In NYC, it is more commonly referred to as an interpretation of the first names (Bay Area Rapid Transit) in the Bay Area."}, {"heading": "Cultural Differences between Regions", "text": "More importantly, some regionally divergent words reveal the unique cultural characteristics of regions. We summarize the characteristics in several aspects, such as IT, finance, and so on. The engineering culture in the Bay Area is clearly reflected in the observations that people there are more likely to relate many words to technologies. Such words include Bay Area reactions interpreted as responses to software interpreted through the narrowest terms such as webpack, file system, and objc (short for Objective-C). In NYC, the word is interpreted literally with the narrowest terms such as reaction, reaction, and so on."}], "references": [{"title": "You tweet what you eat: Studying food consumption through twitter", "author": ["Mejova Abbar", "S.
