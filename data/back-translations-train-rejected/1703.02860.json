In this paper, first from a message sender perspective, we focus on people's motives in using four types of emojis -- positive, neutral, negative, and non-facial. We compare the willingness levels of using these emoji types for seven typical intentions that people usually apply nonverbal cues for in communication. The results of extensive statistical hypothesis tests not only report the popularities of the intentions, but also uncover the subtle differences between emoji types in terms of intended uses. Second, from a perspective of message recipients, we further study the sentiment effects of emojis, as well as their duplications, on verbal messages. Different from previous studies in emoji sentiment, we study the sentiments of emojis and their contexts as a whole. The experiment results indicate that the powers of conveying sentiment are different between four emoji types, and the sentiment effects of emojis vary in the contexts of different valences.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 14:57:10 GMT  (624kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02860v1", "10 pages, published at ICWSM'17"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, published at ICWSM'17", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.HC", "authors": ["tianran hu", "han guo", "hao sun", "thuy-vy thi nguyen", "jiebo luo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.02860"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.02860.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Spice up Your Chat: The Intentions and Sentiment Effects of Using Emoji", "authors": ["Tianran Hu", "Han Guo", "Hao Sun", "Thuy-vy Thi Nguyen", "Jiebo Luo"], "emails": ["jluo}@cs.rochester.edu,", "guohan@ict.ac.cn", "sun@urmc.rochester.edu,", "thuy-vy.t.nguyen@rochester.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "It is reported that almost half of posts on Instagram contain emojis (Dimson 2015), and emojis replace emoticons (e.g.;) and:))) on Twitter to become a popular form of representation of things, feelings, concepts and so on (Pavalanathan and Eisenstein 2015).

In the paper, the authors vectorized emojis in Instagram posts and used the words in the vector space closest to the emojis as their explanations. Eisner et al. also proposed an embedding model - emoji2vec - to learn emoji representations (Eisner et al. 2016). Instead of learning the emoji vectors from social media posts, they used the emoji descriptions as their explanations and reported better performance in evaluation tasks.

We borrow the approaches proposed in these studies, because emoticons can be considered the natural evolution of emoticons.

In this work, they proposed for the first time to investigate emoticons and pure verbal messages as a whole. They investigated the effects of positive and negative emoticons on positive and negative verbal messages. In the paper it is reported that positive emoticons increase the positivity of positive verbal messages, but negative emoticons do not increase the negativity of negative messages. Following this approach, Derks et al. examined the mood effects of more types of emoticons in different social contexts and reported similar results (Derks, Bos and Von Grumbkow 2007b; 2007a).

All the emojis studied in this work are in iOS format - one of the most commonly used emoji formats. 2 To select representative emojis for each type, we first rank the popularity of all emojis. The ranking is obtained based on the frequency of occurrences of each emoji in our collected dataset. The pre-collected dataset contains 10 million tweets and was collected from May to September 2016 using the Twitter Streaming API3. To select face mojis from different ranges of values, we follow the 50 most commonly used emojis in 2010 (the Lual approach)."}, {"heading": "Intention Selection", "text": "We summarize these intentions and their explanations from previous work as follows. \u2022 Express feelings: similar to facial expressions in direct communication, use emojis in the CMC to express feelings or emotions, such as anger, happiness, fear, etc. \u2022 Strengthen expression: use emojis to enhance expression, e.g. by adding emojis to make a positive message more positive. \u2022 Adjust sound: use emojis to adjust the tone, for example, to take a post or message more kindly or less seriously by adding emojis. \u2022 Express humor: use emojis to make communication more fun and lively. \u2022 Express irony: use emojis to make communication more sarcastic or ironic. \u2022 Express intimacy: use emojis to make readers of posts or messages more engaged, express intimacy and closeness to describe the content of the flag."}, {"heading": "User Study on the Intentions of Using Emojis", "text": "Following the approach of studying the senders \"intentions to use emoticons reported in this study (Derks, Bos and Von Grumbkow 2008), we construct a 7 (intentions) x 20 (emojis) large online survey within the subjects. For each combination of an emoji and an intention, we ask the participants to rate their willingness to use the emoji for the intention on a 7-point scale (7 = absolutely ready, 1 = not at all ready). For each participant, the 140 combinations of emojis and intentions are displayed in a survey in a random order. Please note that the emojis presented as images rather than as unicode graphics, in order to avoid the influence of different display platforms. We also ask the participants to provide their basic demographic information and frequency of use of emojis.

Each user study corresponds to a type of emoji. As suggested in previous work (Derks, Bos and Von Grumbkow 2007b; Ganster, Eimler and Kra \ufffd mer 2012), we prepare three simple verbal messages with positive, negative and neutral ratings. The three messages are borrowed from (Walther and DAddario 2001) with minor adjustments to our study. In our surveys, a simple message is combined with either one emoji or three double emojis or as a control condition without emoji. By analyzing the pre-collected data, we find that people use an emoji three times more frequently than other numbers of duplications, and the average number of duplications is 3.3. Accordingly, we set the number of duplications of an emoji as three in our survey."}, {"heading": "Preliminary", "text": "In this section, we briefly present the statistical background to this paper.Within & Between Subjects Design In an experimental design within the subjects, participants are asked to take all treatments (e.g. emojis in our user studies).On the contrary, in our first user study, each participant is only asked to take one treatment, for example, to interview a worker who has only one emojis for all seven intentions. Clearly, within the subjects, the number of participants could be effectively reduced. However, this experimental design also leads to dependence on the data collected - an employee's 7 \u00d7 20 scores are not independent to deal with dependence, a repeated measure ANOVA that is called zero."}, {"heading": "Intentions of Using Emoji", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to go to another world are going to go to another world where they have not yet arrived, where they have not yet arrived, but where they have not yet arrived."}, {"heading": "Sentiment Effects of Emojis", "text": "In our second user study on emoji sentiment effects, four different groups of workers take part in surveys for four types of emoji. Repeated ANOVA tests are initially conducted on the basis of the data collected. All tests point to significant differences between the mean sentiment values of the combinations of emojis and simple verbal messages. To investigate the effect of an emoji on a message, we perform tukey post-hoc tests to compare the mean sentiment values between two conditions: (1) the message coupled with the emoji and (2) the control condition (the same message without emoji). A significant positive difference indicates that the emoji increases mood, and a significant negative difference indicates that the emoji reduces mood. Similarly, we compare the sentiment effects of dual emojis, the middle sentiment between two conditions: (1) a single emoji coupled with a positive message (the sensation is the sensation of a positive message), and (2) the sensation of a negative message."}, {"heading": "Positive Emojis", "text": "Positive Message The results of the Tukey post-hoc tests indicate that there is no significant difference between the purely positive verbal message and the combinations of the message with five positive emojis in terms of the mean sentiment score. Such results suggest that positive emojis associated with a positive verbal message do not convey greater positivity. It also implies the difference between positive emojis and positive emoticons, which are reported to have an increasing effect on positive verbal messages (Walther and DAddario 2001).Neutral Message All five positive emojis increase the sentiment score of the simply neutral message. The largest increase is due to an average increase of 2.04 (SD = 0.14), and the smallest by (M = 1.27, SD = 0.12).Negative Message Positive emojis significantly increase the mood of the simply negative message."}, {"heading": "Neutral Emojis", "text": "Positive Message Interestingly, neutral emojis have a significant decreasing effect on the mood of the clearly positive message. According to our intention study, neutral emojis are the most appropriate way to express irony. We assume that neutral emojis translate sarcasm into a clearly positive message, thereby reducing positivity. Neutral Message It is suggested that neutral emojis do not have a significant effect on a neutral message. All five tukey posthoc tests show no significant difference between a purely neutral message and combinations of neutral emojis and the message in terms of the mid-mood scale. Negative Message Similar to the neutral message, there is no significant effect of neutral emojis on a negative message. Therefore, the decreasing effects of neutral emojis only observed with a clearly positive message."}, {"heading": "Negative Emojis", "text": "Positive message All five negative emojis significantly decrease the mood of a simple positive message, with the greatest deterioration of the (M = -3.18, SD = 0.24) and the smallest deterioration of the mood (M = -2.32, SD = 0.20). We also calculate the overall ratings of these combinations. Results show that the mood of the combination and the positive message is significantly lower than 4 points, indicating negative value. The mood scores of the other four combinations show no significant difference from 4 points, which is consistent with our score in the previous intention study - negative emojis can either neutralize the mood of a positive message, resulting in neutral value, or transform the general mood into negative. Therefore, negative emojis more likely than positive emojis to express feelings, which is consistent with our score in the previous intention study - peo-ple are more willing to use negative emojis than positive emojis."}, {"heading": "Non-facial Emojis", "text": "Our results of positive, neutral and negative emojis indicate that the sentiment effects of emojis of one type are consistent. However, the sentiment effects of non-face emojis are relatively small (less than 1 point).Positive message test results show that two non-facial emojis have increasing sentiment effects on a purely positive message, while the increments are both relatively small. (M = 0.47, SD = 0.10) and (M = 0.49, SD = 0.08).The remaining three emojis show no significant sentiment effects on a purely positive message. Apart from all non-facial emojis, they are reported to significantly increase the mood of a purely neutral message. Increments are also relatively small, with the largest caused by (M = 0.93, SD = 0.11) and the smallest by e.M = 71, with negative Sji results having no significant impact on the emotion tests."}, {"heading": "Duplicate Emojis", "text": "Contrary to the conclusion (Diving and Kanjo 2016), our results suggest that in most cases, duplicates do not make significant differences in sentiment scores over individual emojis. In all circumstances, the use of double positive and neutral emojis does not lead to an increase or decrease in sentiment scores. In the case of negative emojis, we observe that the duplications of two emojis convey more negativity, but only in conjunction with the unique negative messages. The decreasing effects are relatively small, and these two negative emojis are (M = -0.39, SD = 0.09) and (M = -0.32, SD = 0.06). The duplications of non-face emojis reportedly express more positivity than single emojis only in two cases, both coupled with the purely positive message. The duplication of emojis are more positive than their individual version (M = 0.45, SD = 0.08), as well as the duplication of 0.6 (D)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "From the sender's perspective, we focus on the intentions of using emojis. We discover that the most popular intentions are to express feelings, strengthen expression, and adjust tone. Furthermore, our results suggest that the subtle differences between emoji types, such as negative emojis, are more likely to be used as positive emojis to express feelings, and neutral emojis are best suited to express irony. From the message recipient's perspective, we study how recipients feel the mood conveyed by emojis. Instead of separating emojis and verbal messages, we treat these two parts as a whole. Our results reveal the divergent sentiment effects of emojis: positive emojis do not affect the mood of clearly positive verb messages, nor do negative emojis affect the mood of simple and verbal messages."}], "references": [{"title": "Are emojis creating a new or old visual language for new generations? a socio-semiotic study", "author": ["H.

In this paper, first from a message sender perspective, we focus on people\u2019s motives in using four types of emojis \u2013 positive, neutral, negative, and non-facial. We compare the willingness levels of using these emoji types for seven typical intentions that people usually apply nonverbal cues for in communication. The results of extensive statistical hypothesis tests not only report the popularities of the intentions, but also uncover the subtle differences between emoji types in terms of intended uses. Second, from a perspective of message recipients, we further study the sentiment effects of emojis, as well as their duplications, on verbal messages. Different from previous studies in emoji sentiment, we study the sentiments of emojis and their contexts as a whole. The experiment results indicate that the powers of conveying sentiment are different between four emoji types, and the sentiment effects of emojis vary in the contexts of different valences.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
