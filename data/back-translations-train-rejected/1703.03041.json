Cells react to their environment by activating signal networks that trigger processes such as growth, survival, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and migration. However, posttranslational modifications, especially phosphorylation, play a key role in these signaling events. In cancer cells, signal networks are often compromised, leading to abnormal behaviors and responses to external stimuli. Endogenous protein transduction in cancer cells is systematically disrupted to redirect cellular decisions from differentiation and apoptosis to proliferation and later invasion. Cancer cells acquire malignancy through accumulation of beneficial gene mutations that achieve the necessary steps toward malignancy. These selective adaptations to independence can be described as the result of an evolutionary process of diversity and selection."}, {"heading": "3 METHODS", "text": "A Bayesian network (BN) is a statistical graphical model that represents a common distribution over n random variables and encodes it using a direct acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the n nodes that relate to the variables. Formally, we define a BN as a direct acyclic graph G = (V, E), where V is the set that contains the n random variables and E is the set of directed arcs over them that represents any random dependence between the variables (Parsons, 2011). In this work, we use such a graphical tool to model a protein network Gp (where a direct acyclic graph) whose structure (i.e. the nodes and arcs in the model) maximizes probability because the observed data on which we draw the conclusions. Furthermore, we define this task as an optimization problem where we have a set of probabilities to maximize the number of observations we are seeking to make D."}, {"heading": "3.1 Hill climbing", "text": "Mountaineering (HC) is one of the simplest iterative techniques proposed for solving optimization problems. While mountaineering consists of a simple and intuitive sequence of steps, it is a good search technique that can be used as a starting point for comparing the performance of more advanced optimization techniques. Mountaineering shares the concept of neighborhood with other techniques (such as simulated glow (Hwang, 1988) and taboo search (Glover, 1989). Search methods based on this latter concept are iterative procedures in which a neighborhood N (i) is defined for each workable solution i and the next solution j is sought among the solutions in N (i). Therefore, neighborhood is a function N: S \u2192 2S that assigns a (non-empty) subset of S. (non-empty) to each solution in the search space S. In our case, each solution is modeled as an adjacency matrix, with an input [j] if the current solution is 1."}, {"heading": "3.2 Tabu search", "text": "As described in Glover's original work (Glover, 1989), Taboo Search (TS) is a meta-heuristic that directs a local heuristic search method to explore the solution space beyond local optimities. One of the main components of this method is the use of adaptive memory that creates more flexible search behavior. Therefore, memory-based strategies are the main feature of TS approaches that are based on the search for \"integrating principles\" that properly combine alternative forms of memory with effective strategies to exploit them. Taboos are one of the characteristic elements of TS compared to mountaineering or other local search methods. The main idea in considering taboos is to stop cycling when moving away from local optima by non-improving movements. When this situation occurs, something needs to be done to prevent the search from tracing its steps back to where it comes from, by reversing the taboos."}, {"heading": "3.3 Genetic Algorithm", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to help themselves, to help themselves and others, to help themselves and to help others.

Such values, namely Loglik, AIC and BIC, are implemented with the bnlearn R package (Scutari, 2009). Specifically, we first looked at the Log Likelihood Score (Loglik), i.e. the logarithm of the previously mentioned Likelihood Score. Subsequently, we used the Akake Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaikes, 1992) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (Schwarz et al., 1978) as regularized loglikelihood scores. To extend these scores to model continuous random variables, we use the multivariate Gaulish implementation of the Log Likelihood Score (see Parsons, 2011) for a formal definition of the scores and (Scutari, 2009) for the assumed implementation."}, {"heading": "4 RESULTS", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate until it is able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have modelled relationships (edges) in causal molecular networks (\"causal edges\") as direct connections between nodes where the inhibition of the parent node can lead to a change in the frequency of the child node, either through direct interaction or through unmeasured intermediate nodes. To this extent, we have tested various methods to reconstruct networks on real and on silico- colored data sets (Bayesian) proposed in the HPN-DREAM challenge. Specifically, we have analyzed the performance of various optimization search schemes, such as Hill Climbing (HC), Tabu Seach (TS) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and various probability values, such as loglik, AIC and BIC. This analysis seems to show better performance of more complex search strategies such as GA on real data sets if we are able to prove the results of TS version search to be very effective."}], "references": [{"title": "Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle", "author": ["H.
