These decisions can be placed in a tree with each measurement represented by a node (e.g. [3]). The node itself can be a human being modelled as a quantum system (e.g. [4]), or a classic means of accessing quantum resources. Quantum models of cognition and information processing offer new insights into the functioning of human environments (e.g. [5])."}, {"heading": "JOINT PROBABILITY AND ENTANGLEMENT", "text": "Consider an urn with a large number of balls that are black, white or half black and half white, and the sampling protocol provides for putting the ball back into the urn after its examination. If there are no half black and half white balls and the number of black and half white balls is identical, this procedure will produce the same probabilities for the events (i) ball observed is white; and (ii) ball observed is black; or P (W) = P (B) = \u00bd. If the sampling is done as follows, the results for, say, two consecutive decisions will be independent of the order of the decisions. In other words, P (WB) = P (BW) = \u00bc. If the urn has 60 pure black balls, 10 half black and half white balls, and 30 pure white balls, we will get P (B) = 0.7; P (W) = 0.4; P (BW) = P (WB) = 0.1."}, {"heading": "DECISION TREES", "text": "This year, more than ever, it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "CONSTRAINED TREE APPROXIMATION", "text": "Let us limit ourselves to two quantum states. Let us limit the probabilities of 00, 01, 10 and 11 as A, B, C and D. These are the values in the diagonals of the density function and A + B + C + D = 1. Let us limit the approximation to this case to only two branching probabilities. The two-layer decision tree will assume to have the branching probabilities of a, 1-a in the first layer and c, 1-c in the second layer. The following equations are implied: ac \u2248 A-ac \u2248 B-ac \u2248 C 1-ac + ac \u2248 D (7) The approximation in the relations results from the fact that two variables (a and c) cannot correspond to the arbitrary values of A, B, C, D.

We showed that in the general case where each node can have arbitrary branching probability values, such a random tree can accurately represent the probabilities associated with any quantum state. Thus, it can be said that quantum branching is equivalent to different branching probabilities at the decision nodes. For a two-qubit state, we also investigated the case of two separate branching probabilities. Classical agents can attribute the randomness of probability values at the branching nodes to the quantum branching or consider it a purely classical decision process with unexplained correlations in its various components."}], "references": [{"title": "Ubiquitous Quantum Structure", "author": ["A.Y.

Classical and quantum nodes can be distinguished based on certain correlations in their states. This paper investigates some properties of the states obtained in a decision tree structure. How these correlations may be mapped to the decision tree is considered. Classical tree representations and approximations to quantum states are provided. INTRODUCTION Imagine a decision system where the choices are made according to the measurements of a quantum state [1][2]. These choices may be mapped into a tree with each measurement is represented by a node (e.g. [3]). The node itself may be a human agent whose cognitions are modeled as a quantum system [4]-[7], or a classical agent that has access to quantum resources. Quantum models of cognition and information processing provide new insight into the workings of human agents in different decision environments (e.g. [8]-[11]) although it comes with features that do not have analogs in classical information [12][13]. Considerations under which quantum probability is the appropriate measure to use for cognitive processes have been examined from a variety of perspectives (e.g. [14]). In human agents, cognitive dissonance describes the stress arising out of holding two contradictory theories or ideas or actions [15][16]. The fact of such a state with contradictions is suggestive of superposition and thus it may justify the idea of quantum cognition. Quantum-like models have also been proposed to explain certain biological processes [17]. In engineered system the issue of dissonance is irrelevant and when considering quantum resources, mutually exclusive states will coexist. There is much research that has gone into measurements that can distinguish between classical and quantum states as evidenced by the great interest in hidden variable theories and the violation of Bell\u2019s Inequalities [18][19]. The distinction between the two is on account of the fact that quantum states come with entanglement as a characteristic that shows up in nonlocality in physical processes and order effects in probability. The difference between classical and quantum domains can under certain conditions be ascertained by a condition on the ratios of the outcomes being the same (Ps) to being different (Pn) for 3-way coincidences.
