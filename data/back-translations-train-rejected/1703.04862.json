But some conditions or requirements, such as exclusiveness hypothesis and completeness constraint, limit the development and application of that theory to a large extend. To overcome the shortcomings and enhance its capability of representing the uncertainty, a novel model, called D numbers, has been proposed recently. However, many key issues, for example how to implement the combination of D numbers, remain unsolved. In the paper, we have explored the combination of D Numbers from a perspective of conflict redistribution, and proposed two combination rules being suitable for different situations for the fusion of two D numbers. The proposed combination rules can reduce to the classical Dempster's rule in Dempster-Shafer theory under a certain conditions. Numerical examples and discussion about the proposed rules are also given in the paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 01:04:49 GMT  (432kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04862v1", "6 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xinyang deng", "wen jiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.04862"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.04862.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Exploring the Combination Rules of D Numbers From a Perspective of Conflict Redistribution", "authors": ["Xinyang Deng", "Wen Jiang"], "emails": ["xinyang.deng@nwpu.edu.cn", "jiangwen@nwpu.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to a different world in which they are able to escape than to another world in which they are able to escape."}, {"heading": "II.

DISCUSSION", "text": "In this paper, we have given two combination rules for D numbers, namely DCR1 and DCR2. In fact, DCR1 is fully contained in DCR2. Therefore, it is only necessary to analyze and discuss the combination rule DCR2. Overall, the main advantage of the proposed combination rule DCR2 is that it simultaneously takes into account the non-exclusivity and incompleteness of information that are the two main features of the D numbers by integrating the idea of global conflict redistribution and partial conflict redistribution from daylight saving time. Essentially, DCR2 can be seen as a generalization of the Dempster rule for the model of D numbers, as it can be completely reduced to the classical Dempster rule under certain conditions. The paper provides a practical combination rule for D numbers. Based on this rule, the theory of D numbers can really be applied in many related fields of application. Meanwhile, we must admit that there are some disadvantages within the proposed rule."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Inspired by related research in daylight saving time, two new combination rules, DCR1 and DCR2, have been proposed for the combination of two D numbers based on the perspective of conflict redistribution. DCR1 is suitable for the situation of non-exclusivity and information completeness, and DCR2 can be used in the case of non-exclusivity and information incompleteness. DCR2 has generalized DCR1. Both of these rules can degenerate into the classical Dempster rule in daylight saving time. In this sense, the model of D numbers with the proposed combination rules is compatible with the framework of daylight saving time. Finally, the characteristics of these rules have been discussed. Future research will examine the combination of several D numbers (\u2265 3), and also the properties and applications of the combination rules for D numbers will be further investigated."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 61671384), the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province (program no. 2016JM6018), the Aviation Science Foundation (program no. 20165553036), the Fund of SAST (program no.

widely applied to uncertainty modelling and knowledge reasoning because of its advantages in dealing with uncertain information. But some conditions or requirements, such as exclusiveness hypothesis and completeness constraint, limit the development and application of that theory to a large extend. To overcome the shortcomings and enhance its capability of representing the uncertainty, a novel model, called D numbers, has been proposed recently. However, many key issues, for example how to implement the combination of D numbers, remain unsolved. In the paper, we have explored the combination of D Numbers from a perspective of conflict redistribution, and proposed two combination rules being suitable for different situations for the fusion of two D numbers. The proposed combination rules can reduce to the classical Dempster\u2019s rule in Dempster-Shafer theory under a certain conditions. Numerical examples and discussion about the proposed rules are also given in the paper.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
