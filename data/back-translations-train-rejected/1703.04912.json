They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 03:53:25 GMT  (93kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04912v1", "44 pages, submitted to ACM Transactions on Computational Logic"], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 00:56:18 GMT  (93kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04912v2", "44 pages, submitted to ACM Transactions on Computational Logic"]], "COMMENTS": "44 pages, submitted to ACM Transactions on Computational Logic", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sebastian binnewies", "zhiqiang zhuang", "kewen wang", "bela stantic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.04912"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.04912.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["ZHIQIANG ZHUANG", "KEWEN WANG", "Sebastian Binnewies", "Zhiqiang Zhuang", "Kewen Wang"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to hide when they see themselves able to achieve their goals, and that they are able to achieve their goals.

Belief Change", "text": "The AGM framework [Alchourro \u0301 n et al. 1985; Ga \u00bc rdenfors 1988] defines expansion, revision and contraction as operations of change on a body of faith held by an agent, but in such a way that the resulting state of belief is consistent. This is achieved by rejecting some existing beliefs. During a contraction, some beliefs are removed in a state of faith without adding new beliefs. In the AGM framework, a state of faith is modeled as a belief, defined as a sentence from a logic-based language L, which is concluded with logical consequences, i.e. when all beliefs are explicitly presented in the knowledge base."}, {"heading": "3. RELATED WORK", "text": "One of the most important developments in adapting the AGM framework of faith conversion to logic programs came with the distance-based approach to logic program revision (Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Q). It is based on the monotonous SE semantics for logic programs and understands a state of faith as a set of SE models of a program. In this thesis, the formula-based revision of postulates (1KM) - (6KM) is briefly translated to logic programs as follows, where a revision operator understands a function from LPA to LPA and the extension of P Q Q as P Q = R so that R LPA and SE (R) respond to SE (P) S (Q)."}, {"heading": "4. ADAPTING THE BELIEF CHANGE FRAMEWORKS", "text": "We assume that a state of belief is represented in the form of a program of LPA and new information if this program per se is not closed with logical consequences. It therefore seems natural that there is a consistent relationship with another program of LPA, although there is a consistent relationship with logical programs within the framework of SE semantics. However, since the majority of previous approaches to logical programs carry out a revision of the AGM framework, we will consider it possible to make appropriate comparisons here as well."}, {"heading": "5.

DISCUSSION", "text": "From our investigations in the previous sections, we can filter out two main results as a belief, thus maintaining the necessary objects of change that we have proposed here. First, the belief of the operators of logic programs and their revisions is essentially satisfactory, assuming a belief state that represents the set of SO models of the entire program. Due to its focus on the program level, the distanced approach neglects information about relationships between atoms that are captured only at the rule level, and thus violates the properties of preservation and supplementation.ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, Vol. 0, No. 0, Release Date: March 2000.For our approach, we have adapted partially fulfilling constructions that allow us to define operators that are more sensitive to the information expressed by the individual rules of a program."}, {"heading": "10. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this thesis, we presented two new constructions of faith change in logic programs. Our specific goal was to overcome the disadvantages of existing semantic revision operators, namely that they do not meet the characteristics of preservation and support. These are fundamental characteristics for a logic program change of faith operator to return intuitive results. To this end, we decided to partially fulfill our operators and adapt ensconcement constructions from a classical change of faith, which allowed us to define syntax-preserving change of faith operators for logic programs that satisfy preservation and support. Our approach is new, that the partially fulfill and ensconcement constructions not only preserve more information from a logic program during a change process, but also allowed natural definitions of contraction operators for logic programs, the first in the field to be the best of our knowledge. To evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translated the revision and contraction postulated from the classical AGM programs and belief bases."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX: PROOFS", "text": "PROPOSITION 4.1: If Q = Q = Q Q (Q), then it complies with (. \u2212 8b).PROOF.

In this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results. We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial meet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which allow us to define syntax-preserving operators that satisfy preservation and support. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more information from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones, but they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the first in the field to the best of our knowledge. In order to evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the revision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to the logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the belief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our operators. We further propose an algorithm that is based on modularising a logic program to reduce partial meet and ensconcement revisions or contractions to performing the operation only on the relevant modules of that program. Finally, we compare our approach to two state-of-the-art logic program revision methods and demonstrate that our operators address the shortcomings of one and generalise the other method.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.996 Copyright 2016 Radical Eye Software"}}}
