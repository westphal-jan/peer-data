An automatic approach to quantify the likeliness of borrowing in social media", "abstract": "Code-mixing or code-switching are the effortless phenomena of natural switching between two or more languages in a single conversation. Use of a foreign word in a language; however, does not necessarily mean that the speaker is code-switching because often languages borrow lexical items from other languages. If a word is borrowed, it becomes a part of the lexicon of a language; whereas, during code-switching, the speaker is aware that the conversation involves foreign words or phrases. Identifying whether a foreign word used by a bilingual speaker is due to borrowing or code-switching is a fundamental importance to theories of multilingualism, and an essential prerequisite towards the development of language and speech technologies for multilingual communities. In this paper, we present a series of novel computational methods to identify the borrowed likeliness of a word, based on the social media signals. We first propose context based clustering method to sample a set of candidate words from the social media data.Next, we propose three novel and similar metrics based on the usage of these words by the users in different tweets; these metrics were used to score and rank the candidate words indicating their borrowed likeliness. We compare these rankings with a ground truth ranking constructed through a human judgment experiment. The Spearman's rank correlation between the two rankings (nearly 0.62 for all the three metric variants) is more than double the value (0.26) of the most competitive existing baseline reported in the literature. Some other striking observations are, (i) the correlation is higher for the ground truth data elicited from the younger participants (age less than 30) than that from the older participants, and (ii )those participants who use mixed-language for tweeting the least, provide the best signals of borrowing.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 12:32:34 GMT  (487kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05122v1", "11 pages, 3 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 3 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jasabanta patro", "bidisha samanta", "saurabh singh", "prithwish mukherjee", "monojit choudhury", "animesh mukherjee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.05122"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.05122.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Is this word borrowed?

All rights reserved. Phenomena of interaction are observed. Code switching or code mixing is one such common phenomenon in which speakers spontaneously switch between several languages in a single conversation, sometimes even within a single sentence or phrase (Auer 1984). A related but linguistically and cognitively distinct phenomenon is lexical borrowing (or simply borrowing), in which a word or phrase from a foreign language is used as part of a language's native vocabulary. Examples of word borrowing are widespread; in Dutch, the English word \"sale\" is now used more frequently than the Dutch equivalent \"uitverkoop.\" Some English words such as \"shop\" are even used in Dutch as \"shopping.\""}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "These two phenomena are observed when the speakers of two or more languages are in close contact with each other. Linguists have long focused on the sociological and communicative necessity of borrowing and mixing messages (Auer 1984; Muysken 1996). Automatic processing of mixed text: One of the first works in automatic processing of code-mixed text files dates back more than thirty years (Joshi 1982), while the task of automatic language identification is even earlier (Gold 1967). Since then, there has been much work in this area. (Sankoff, Poplack and Vanniarajan 1990) reported on the complexity of selecting functions to determine the indicators of borrowing. This work further shows that it is not always true that only highly frequent words are borrowed, nonce words along with the common words."}, {"heading": "Datasets and preprocessing", "text": "We look at mixed English-Hindi code tweets from India for the purpose of our experiments. \"To capture the data collection, we click on tweets (between Nov 2015 and Jan 2016) that relate to 28 hashtags representing different Indian contexts covering important topics such as sports, religion, movies, politics, etc. This process leads to the collection of 811981 tweets (see details later in this section), each tweet being crawled to determine that there are 3982 users using mixed language to tweet. We then systematically sift through the lines of those 3982 users between Feb 2016 and March 2016 to collect more mixed tweets. Using this two-step process, we collect a total of 1550714 different tweets. From this data, we filter tweets that are not written in romanized font, tweets, tweets with only URLs, and tweets with blank content. Post filtering, we get 787606 tweets that we use for the rest of the analysis."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "In this section, we present the baseline measure and our metrics based on population-level signals to quantify the likelihood of borrowing, as well as a scheme for sampling a suitable set of target words for the purposes of our experiments."}, {"heading": "Baseline metric and ranking", "text": "Baseline metric - We consider the log (FEFH) value proposed in (Bali et al. 2014) to be a base metric. Here, FE refers to the frequency of the Devanagari transcription of the word w in the Jagaran corpus. FH, on the other hand, refers to the frequency of the Hindi translation of the word w in the Jagaran corpus. Both the transcription and the translation of the words were carried out by volunteers who are native Indian speakers. The authors in (Bali et al. 2014) claim that the more positive the value of this metric is for a word w, the higher the likelihood that it will be borrowed. The more negative the value is, the higher the probability that the word w is an example of code mixing. Ranking - Based on the values obtained from the above metric for a number of target words, we rank these words; words with high positive values at the top of the ranking list and words with high values at the bottom of the negative resolutions of the two words, we compare the value of the bottom of the two."}, {"heading": "Proposed metric and ranking", "text": "In this section, we present three novel and closely related metrics based on the language usage patterns of social media users. 1Jagaran corpus: http: / / fire.irsi.res.in / fire / static / dataUnique User Ratio (UUR) - The Unique User Ratio for word usage in different languages is defined as: UUUR (w) = UHi + UCMHUEn (1), where UHi is the number of unique users who have used the word w at least once in a Hindi tweet.

Clustering In language processing, context plays an important role in understanding different properties of a word. Therefore, in our study, we also try to use the language markers as characteristics of context words for a specific target word. Our hypothesis here is that there should be word classes that have similar context characteristics and the probability of being borrowed in each class should be different. For example, if an English word is predominantly surrounded by Hindi words, it seems more likely that there are two examples in the box below to illustrate these words. Example I: @ KapilianPooja Welcome. \"Film jaroor dekhna.\" Nahi to injection ready hai. - Dr Mashoor Gulati (@ ItsDrGulati) Example II: @ HelpU Trust @ DrKumarVishwas Kuch to hurt them karo rji....

Each participant was asked to respond to a ranking of 57 target words.

Ranking correlation: The ranking correlation between the UR and the ranking of basic truths is shown in Table 6. Interestingly, the correlation between the ranking of the UUR and the basic truths of the young population is better than the truth of the basic truths of the older population. This may indicate that UR is able to predict the most recent borrowing more accurately. However, please note that the ranking of the UUR has a much higher correlation with both basic truths than the ranking of the basic truths of the UUR values compared to the ranking of the basic truths.
