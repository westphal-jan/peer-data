These orders can indicate preferences of individuals, groups or a company on a wide range of topics, including various products, goods, meals, jobs, services, athletes, movies, leisure activities etc. in the media, rankings of the object often appear in the form of various TOP10, TOP100, etc. Ranking of the object is also important in the search for a desired object. For a certain set of keywords or key terms, users can search for books, movies, songs or Internet pages. Many Internet shops offer rankings of their goods ordered by price, year of production, customer recommendations, etc. Ranking is useful in searching for information; the most well-known Internet search engine is Google Page Ranking algorithm, which ranks Internet pages according to their relevance keywords ranked for specific problem or ranking was found in Rzzy."}, {"heading": "1. Crisp rankings", "text": "In a Crisp ranking, each object is assigned its position, so that n objects are ranked from 1st to N. Place. Thus, each ranking can be considered a permutation of objects. (Each ranking (any ranking) of n objects can, however, be represented by a square binary matrix of the order n. (A, C, B), can be represented by a matrix of 1 in each row and column - a permutation matrix. For example, the permutation (ranking) of three objects A, B and C is such that A is 1st, C is 2nd and B is 3rd place. (A, C, B), can be represented by a matrix corresponding to the positions and columns: 1 0 00 0 0 10 1 0. (0) \u03c0 = Distance-based rating of rankings is based on the similarity of rankings based on the premise that the two rankings are more similar, the smaller is their distance."}, {"heading": "2. Fuzzy rankings", "text": "In this case, however, the decision-maker is not sure whether A is the first or second ranking relative to B. Therefore, a DM can assign a value of 0.5 to 1 position for A and 0.5 for the 2nd position of A and 0.5 for the 2nd position of A, meaning that a (precise) bond with B. In this case, the matrix representation would show that in Figure 3a there is more inclination towards A than the 1st object, for example, he can assign the value 0.7 for A to the 1st position and 0.3 for the 2nd position (Levels B with 0.3 to the 2nd position)."}, {"heading": "3. Fuzzy rankings and ordering of objects", "text": "To classify all objects of a given fuzzy order of precedence, the following pair-by-pair dominance relationship is introduced (Mazurek 2011a, 2012): Definition 7. Let's be the fuzzy ranking of an object i at position j. Then a cumulative fuzzy ranking hij of an object i from the first to the last position is given as follows: 1jij ik k H = = =. (8) Definition 8. An object r dominates an object s () r if and only if all cumulative fuzzy rankings Hrj of an object r higher (at least once) or cumulative fuzzy rankings Hsj of an object s are equal: () r s, s, rj sjH, {} 1, 2,..., j n. (9) The highest ranking (the best) object is the object dominated by an object that is not controlled by any other objects (it should only be partially related)."}, {"heading": "4. Fuzzy rankings and similarity", "text": "The similarity between two fuzzy rankings iR and jR can be defined by analogy to the similarity of sharp rankings over relations (2-5). Given the two fuzzy rankings of the same set of n objects and the corresponding penalty matrix, the similarity of iR and jR is expressed as a value in the [] 0.1 interval when the value 0 expresses minimum similarity and 1 maximum similarity (identity). Definition 3. \"Let A be a finite set of objects and let iR and jR rankings of all objects of A be expressed in a matrix form. Then, the difference Dij of the two rankings is a (crisp) matrix given as: i jijD R = \u2212.

Fuzzy rankings and indecisiveness", "text": "To judge indecision, Shannon's entropy can be used as a measure of uncertainty, see e.g. Klir and Folger (1987): 2 1 ()) () log (()) ni i i H p x p x p x p x = \u2212 \u2211. (10) where p (xi) are probabilities corresponding to xi, {} 1,2,..., i n, and 2 () log () 0p x p x x = for () 0p x = by definition. A decision maker is absolutely undecided if he / she takes the fuzzy order with the uniform distribution 1 () ip x n =, {} izzy =, 2,..., i n. In other words, all objects are placed equally."}, {"heading": "6. Numerical examples", "text": "In this section, several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the use of fuzzy rankings. Example 3. Consider the fuzzy ranking of 4 objects (A, B, C, and D) shown in Figure 4, and we arrange all objects. First, relation (8) calculates the cumulative fuzzy ranking hij of all objects, see Figure 5. Note from Figure 5 that A ranks better (higher) than B for 1st place; A is ranked better than B for 1st and 2nd place overall; both objects are equal for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place overall, and of course A and B are equal for all positions. Therefore, A dominates B (BA) using relation (9). After evaluating all pairs, the following overall rating of all four alternatives is as follows: 1. A, 2. B, 3. C, 3. C, and 4. D. Example 4. Example 4. Example 4. Consider two fuzzy rankings 1R and 2R."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusions", "text": "The aim of the article was to introduce blurred rankings and some of their characteristics in relation to the arrangement of objects, a measure of similarity between two blurred rankings and their indecision. Blurred rankings are a natural generalisation of sharp rankings and can be used in situations where a decision maker is not sure about the exact ranking of particular objects. In addition, the presented approach can be used in decision-making in a group or in decision frameworks for multiple criteria, as rankings provided by a number of experts or rankings relating to specific criteria can easily be transformed into a blurred ranking that needs further analysis."}], "references": [{"title": "The Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient", "author": ["H.
