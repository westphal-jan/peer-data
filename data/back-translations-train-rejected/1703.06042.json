It allows us to describe pro-1 how we will use the tool to use a simple and well-defined example, while the tool is used to evaluate the performance of solvers, we will here use an analogy with cars. The evaluation results are reported in Table 1. Let's assume that we want to compare the performance of 3 cars, cA, cB and cC.

We also proposed a framework for roughly estimating visual improvements that have led to certain parts of a solution process.
