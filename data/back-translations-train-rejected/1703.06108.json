INTRODUCTION", "text": "Over the past decade, a number of open knowledge databases (KBs) have emerged, the most popular of which include Freebase, Wikipedia, and Yago, each containing about 48 million, 25 million, and 10 million entities, many of which overlap within the KBs. In NLP entities linking 1, the task is to link the said entities in the text to their identity within the KBs. A fundamental part of setting up a real-time disk link system is selecting the entities to be considered, since memory restrictions prohibit consideration of the entire knowledge base [1]. In addition, some entities may not be relevant. To maximize the quality of the NLP entity link system, we need to include as many important entities as possible. In this paper, we identify a collection of characteristics to perform scoring and ranking of the entities."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Much of previous work has focused on the temporal popularity of entities, as well as Context 1, also known as Entity Linking (NEL), Entity Disambiguation (NED) or Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) WWW 2017 Companion, April 3-7, 2017, Perth, Australia. However, little study has been done on the structure of the global rank of entities within a KB. The temporal significance of entities on Twitter was examined by Pedro et. [4]. In [2], the authors propose a hybrid model for entity ranking and selection in the context of representing the most important entities for a given limitation while eliminating redundant entities. Entity ranking of Wikipedia entities in the context of a query was performed using link structure and categories [5] as well as diagram methods and web search [6]."}, {"heading": "3. OUR APPROACH", "text": "In view of KB, we want to create a global long-term ranking of companies in order of their socially recognizable importance. In building the system for linking NLP companies, the leading companies in KB should receive the highest level of perceived quality from occasional observers."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Set", "text": "We collected a marked data set by selecting 10,969 units. We randomly selected the units and added some important units to compensate for the distortion between important and non-important entries. Each evaluator had to rate the units on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most important. Seven evaluators used the following guidelines regarding importance: public figures important if they are currently great professional athletes, politicians, etc. If they are no longer active, important if they have influence (e.g. Muhammad Ali, Tony Blair). Locations consider the population (e.g. Albany, California vs. Toronto, Canada), historical significance (Waterloo). Data unimportant if they are not abbreviated for a holiday or event (July 4, 9 / 11). Newspapers important, especially high circulation (WSJ). Sports teams important if they play in a professional league. Schools important if they are recognized worldwide. Films & Songs significant licensing and influential classics important - often unimportant."}, {"heading": "3.2 Features and Scoring", "text": "Characteristics are derived from Freebase and Wikipedia sources. They measure popularity within Wikipedia links and how important an entity within Freebase is. Some signals used are page rank, number of inputs / outputs and ratio, number of categories to which a page in Wikipedia belongs. We also use Xiv: 170 3.06 108v 1 [cs.I R] 17 March 201 7Number of objects to which a given entity is associated, i.e. object and object type characteristics, as well as the number of times a given entity was an object in relation to another entity, i.e. subject and subject type characteristics. We also extract identities in the KB of an entity and use its clout score [3] as a characteristic. The complete set of derived characteristics and their performance is listed in Table 1. We model the score of the evaluator using simple linear regression characteristics."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "Table 1 shows precision, callback, F1 and population coverage for the full list of entities and the final system. The importance score was calculated using Equation 1, rounding the final value to an integer value so that it can be compared with the terms from the basic truth data. We observe that Wikipedia attributes have the highest precision of all the attributes. Freebase attributes have the highest coverage values. The clout score function also has one of the highest individual precision values. The final model shows the lowest RMSE value. We also record the distribution of entity types in the top 1 million listed entities and the unranked list for the English language. 11% of the entities are entities of the \"person\" type in the ranking list, while the highest entities of the \"person\" type in the top 1 million listed entities in the English language list and the unlisted entities in the English language."}, {"heading": "5. SUMMARY", "text": "We provide the ranking of the 500 000 largest entities as an open source dataset at https: / / github.com / klout / opendata. Finally, in this paper, we created a global ranking of entities in several languages, combining characteristics from multiple knowledge bases, and we found that combining several characteristics gives the best results."}, {"heading": "6.
