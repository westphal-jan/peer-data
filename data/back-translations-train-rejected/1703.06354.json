Moreover, the implications of the trade-off for the reliability and stability of artificial autonomous systems and ensuring their alignment with human goals and ethics are under investigation. Agents can only do one thing at a time. However, research suggests that humans may hold multiple conflicting goals (Emmons, King, & Sheldon, 1993; Karoly, 1993).

Artificial autonomous systems may also need to find ways to cope with conflicting goals. Indeed, the intricate interplay among different goals may be critical to the design as well as long\u2010term safety and stability of artificial autonomous systems. I discuss some of the critical features of the human self\u2010regulation system and how it might be applied to an artificial system. Furthermore, the implications of goal conflict for the reliability and stability of artificial autonomous systems and ensuring their alignment with human goals and ethics is examined. Goal Conflict in Autonomous Systems 3 Agents can only do one thing at a time. Research suggests, however that people hold multiple conflicting goals (Emmons, King, & Sheldon, 1993; Karoly, 1993). Although this may be problematic at times, there is reason to believe that having multiple conflicting goals may have benefits for autonomous systems as well. In particular, perhaps paradoxically, having conflicting goals may help ensure the stability and reliability of an autonomous system. Having conflicting goals helps to prevents humans from engaging in behaviors that are irrational, perverse, or are self\u2010 or other\u2010damaging. For these reasons, artificial autonomous agents may need to emulate this design. That is, an artificial agent should hold multiple independent goals all competing for completion at the same time. Such a system may be more stable and ultimately may be safer than systems based on other goal structures. With this in mind, this paper has two goals. First, the key features of human goal behavior (self\u2010 regulation) will be laid out. This will serve as a brief overview for researchers interested in emulating these features. Second, I will endeavor to explain why such a design is inherently safer, more reliable, and aligned with human interests than other approaches to AI safety.", "creator": "\u00fe\u00ff"}}}
