In this paper, we propose a new approach, medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN), to generate realistic synthetic EHRs.

Synthetic Data Generation for Health Data: De-Identification of EHR data is the prominent technical method for protecting patient privacy when sharing EHR data for research (Johnson et al., 2016). However, the definition does not guarantee that a system is risk-free. In certain circumstances, patient re-identification can be achieved through residual distinguishable patterns in different traits (e.g. demographics (Sweeney, 1997; El Emam et al., 2011a), diagnoses (Loukides et al., 2010), laboratory tests (Atreya et al., 2013), cross-service visits (Malin and Sweeney, 2004), and genomic variants (Erlich and Narayanan, 2014) to mitigate vulnerabilities in patient identification."}, {"heading": "3 Method", "text": "We first describe the structure of the EHR data and the associated mathematical notations, followed by details on medGAN."}, {"heading": "3.1 Description of EHR Data and Notations", "text": "We assume that there are a number of discrete variables (e.g. diagnostic, drug or procedure codes) in the EHR data that can be expressed as a fixed-size x-Z-C- + vector, where the value of the ith dimension indicates the number of occurrences (i.e. counts) of the i-th variable in the patient record. In addition to the count variables, a visit log can also be represented as a binary vector x-0, 1-C value, where the ith dimension indicates the absence or occurrence of the ith variable in the patient record. Note that we can also represent demographic information such as age and gender as a counting and binary variable, where learning the distribution of counting variables is generally more difficult than learning the distribution of binary variables. This is because the model needs to learn more than simple coexistence relationships between the different dimensions."}, {"heading": "3.2 Preliminary: Generative Adversarial Network", "text": "# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"}, {"heading": "3.4 Minibatch Averaging", "text": "In fact, it is a way in which most people are able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves, as if they were able to identify themselves."}, {"heading": "3.5 Enhanced Generator Training", "text": "Similar to GAN image processing, we observed that the balance of performance of D and G in the discrete multi-layer variable setting was quite challenging (Goodfellow, 2016).

While G still managed to learn under such a situation, performance appeared suboptimal, and updating \u03b8g and \u03b8dec more often than any iteration degraded performance. Considering the importance of an optimal D (Goodfellow, 2016), we decided not to limit the discriminatory power of D, but to improve the learning efficiency of G by applying batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and shortcut connection (He et al., 2016).

We use the training set R to train the models, and then generate the same number of synthetic samples S.

Minibatch discrimination does not seem to improve the results, most likely due to the discrete nature of the data sets. Improving the learning efficiency of generator G through batch normalization and abbreviation has clearly contributed to improving the results on both datasets. Figure 2b compares the dimensional probability performance of baseline models with medGAN. Independent samples (IS), of course, show great performance as expected. DBN, given its stochastic binary nature, shows a performance comparable to medGAN. VAE, although slightly worse than DBN and medGAN, can capture the GAN-specific processing probability relatively well, with the overall dimensional weakness clearly visible at each medal."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Dimensions-wise prediction", "text": "Figure 3a shows the dimensional prediction power of different versions of medGAN. The complete medGAN again shows the best performance as in the dimensional probability task. Although the advanced versions of medGAN do not seem to increase the performance dramatically as in the previous task, this is due to the complex nature of the interdimensional relationship compared to the independent dimensional probability. Figure 3b shows the dimensional prediction power of basic models compared to medGAN. As expected, IS is not able to grasp the interdimensional relationship due to its naive scanning method. VAE shows similar behavior as in the previous task and shows weaknesses in predicting codes with low probability of occurrence. Again, DBN shows a comparable, if not slightly better performance than medGAN, which results from its binary nature."}, {"heading": "4.3 Quantitative Evaluation for Count Variables", "text": "To evaluate the counting variables, we use the Sutter Heart Failure (RF) dataset, which is a subset of Sutter PAMF, consisting of 30,738 patients whose records were taken for exactly 18 months. Note that the total number of hospitalizations of each patient may vary over the 18-month period, which is a perfect test case for counting variables. Detailed process of creating the Sutter RF dataset is in Appendix 2. Since we have confirmed the superior performance of the full medGAN for binary variables, we will focus on comparing it to baseline models in this section. Note that to generate counting variables, we use all activation functions in both VAE and medGAN (except the discriminator) as a measure of predictive values."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Dimensions-wise average count", "text": "Figure 5 shows the performance of baseline models and medGAN. The discontinuous behavior of VAE is due to its extremely low-variance synthetic samples. We found that the synthetic samples of VAE showed on average nine orders of magnitude smaller standard deviations than the synthetic samples of medGAN. medGAN, on the other hand, shows a good performance in the simple replacement of activation functions. Figure 4 shows the counter histograms of five most common codes from the Sutter RF dataset, in which the top row was drawn with the real data and the bottom row with the synthetic data of medGAN. We see that the synthetic counterpart of medGAN has a very similar distribution as the real data. This tells us that medGAN not only tries to match the average number of codes (i.e. binomial distributor), but learns the actual distribution of the data."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Dimensions-wise prediction", "text": "Figure 6 shows the performance of base models and medGAN. We clearly see that medGAN shows superior performance. Experiments with counter variables are particularly interesting because medGAN seems to make a smooth transition from binary variables to counter variables, with only a replacement of the activation function. We also speculate that the dimensional prediction power of medGAN will increase with more training data, as the Sutter RF dataset consists of only 30K samples."}, {"heading": "4.4 Qualitative Evaluation", "text": "In order to perform a qualitative evaluation of medGAN, we use Sutter RF datasets to train medGAN and generate synthetic samples with counter variables. We then randomly select 50 datasets from real data and 50 datasets from synthetic data, mix the sequence and present them to a physician (specializing in internal medicine) who is asked to evaluate how realistic each dataset is on a scale of 1 to 10 (of which 10 is the most realistic), using the human physician as a discriminator to provide the quality evaluation of the synthetic data generated by medGAN. The results of this evaluation are shown in Figure 7. Results indicate that the synthetic data of medGAN are generally indistinguishable for a human physician - with the exception of several qualitative outliers. In these cases, the falsified data sets identified by the physician were either lacking suitable drug codes or exhibiting both male-code-related codes (e.g., female-coopause)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this work, we have proposed medGAN, which uses a generative, contradictory framework to learn how to distribute discrete electronic medical records (EHR). medGAN has achieved impressive results for both binary variables and counting variables through rigorous evaluation of two datasets. Considering the difficulty of accessibility of EHRs, we expect medGAN to contribute to health research. As we have demonstrated the versatility of the GAN framework, we also expect that this will encourage other researchers to apply the GAN framework to different datasets and tasks. In the future, we plan to study the sequential version of medGAN and include other modalities such as laboratory interventions, patient demographics and medical notes in the free text."}], "references": [{"title": "Reducing patient re-identification", "author": ["R.V.

However, various concerns, particularly over privacy, can limit access to and collaborative use of EHR data. Sharing synthetic EHR data could mitigate risk. In this paper, we propose a new approach, medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN), to generate realistic synthetic EHRs. Based on an input EHR dataset, medGAN can generate high-dimensional discrete variables (e.g., binary and count features) via a combination of an autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. We also propose minibatch averaging to efficiently avoid mode collapse, and increase the learning efficiency with batch normalization and shortcut connections. To demonstrate feasibility, we showed that medGAN generates synthetic EHR datasets that achieve comparable performance to real data on many experiments including distribution statistics, predictive modeling tasks and medical expert review.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
