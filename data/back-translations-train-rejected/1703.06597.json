It consists of the demand characteristics of the customer, which describe the relationship between price and quantity of goods. If the price of a good is low, the customer buys more goods and services than if the price is high. The relationship between price and the willingness of the customers to buy goods and services is called demand curve. Conversely, the lower the price, the less goods and services the suppliers are willing to produce. The point at which the suppliers are willing to offer a certain quantity of goods and services that are identical to those that the customers are willing to buy is called balance. Artificial intelligence enables companies, such as Amazon, to collect information about the customers so that they are able to build a basis for the price and thus create an individual basis for the price."}, {"heading": "Rational choice", "text": "Some of the theories used are based on perfect rationality. In this paper, the theories of rational choice, preference and benefit maximization are examined. Rational choice theory dictates that when agents make decisions, they do so on the basis of a desire for maximum benefit. However, in perfect rationality, every step these agents take on the path to ultimate decision is not necessarily optimal, but the totality of all the steps they take can be rational. A type of artificial intelligence called amplification optimization can be explored in the context of evolutionary design to examine the issue of rationality. Problems where rational local action is crucial to the global rational solution, such as making a stupid move in a game to deceive the opponent, and the condition under which an irrational technique becomes necessary to achieve global rationality (Marwala and Hurwitz, 2017)."}, {"heading": "Rational expectations", "text": "Rational Expectations Theory dictates that people predict the future based on past and available information, and their predictions are not systematically wrong. Thus, predicting the future is nothing more than the arrangement of existing information. Adaptive Expectations Theory predicts the future solely on the basis of previous data, and this has proven to be biased. With the advent of artificial intelligence, data fusion, and big data, the information that can be used in models to predict the future can include deconstructed text data and images, making predictions of rational expectations more accurate, thereby reducing the degree of uncertainty in decision-making (Marwala and Hurwitz, 2017)."}, {"heading": "Bounded rationality", "text": "The theory of flexibly limited rationality is an extension of the theory of limited rationality. In particular, it is pointed out that a decision-making process involves three components, namely the collection and analysis of information, the correlation machine and the causal machine. Rational decision-making involves the use of information that is almost always imperfect and incomplete, along with an intelligent machine that, if it is a human being, is inconsistent in making decisions. In the theory of limited rationality, this decision is made independently of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and imperfect, and that the human brain is inconsistent, and therefore that decision to be made is made within the limits of those limits. In the theory of flexibly limited rationality, signal processing is used to filter noise and outliers in the data, and the correlation machine is applied to missing information, and artificial intelligence is used to make more consistent decisions."}, {"heading": "Asymmetric information", "text": "When agents come together to make decisions, it is often the case that one agent has more information than the other, and this distorts the market. If an agent intends to manipulate a decision in his favor, the agent can signal incorrect or correct information. Alternatively, an agent can look for information to reduce the impact on asymmetric information. With the advent of big data and artificial intelligence, signaling and screening has been facilitated, and the effect of artificial intelligence on the theory of asymmetric information, especially given that screening is facilitated by artificial intelligence and data mining, is that it reduces the degree of information asymmetry in the markets, thereby reducing the resulting distortion of the markets by making them more efficient and reducing the volume of trade in the market. The more artificial intelligence is in the market, the lower the volume of trade in the market, and the overall efficiency of the market is likely to improve over time as the market becomes smarter with smarter marketers and analysts (2017)."}, {"heading": "Pricing", "text": "Price theory is a well-established mechanism that illustrates the constant push-and-pull between buyers and consumers and the ultimately semi-stable price found for a given good. Theory explains very well the two-person situation of a single buyer and a single seller. This problem becomes exponentially more difficult as more and more buyers and sellers are introduced into a market model, especially if they have strategies to stay ahead not only of their target but also of their competitors. Intelligent multi-agent systems are used to model complex behavior in each agent, thus laying the groundwork for the creation of complex pricing models based on the introduction or removal of certain agents from a large, complex system. These models can be robust and detailed enough to capture not only the constant final prices, but also the dynamics of price fluctuations, which will be of great interest to anyone who wants to model the price movements of goods within the market."}, {"heading": "Game theory", "text": "In game theory, agents interact with rules to make a profit at a point of equilibrium often referred to as the Nash Balance. The advent of artificial intelligence enables multi-agent game theory, and the implications of this development are that its implementation is far-reaching in issues such as balance and optimal decisions. In addition, statistical physics is being introduced and multi-agent games can now be introduced into game research (Marwala and Hurwitz, 2017)."}, {"heading": "Mechanism design", "text": "In game theory, players have rules and payout mechanisms and interact until a certain state of equilibrium is reached, so we can see how a game with rules and payout mechanisms achieves equilibrium. Mechanism design is the opposite of this, we know what the end state should be, and our job is to identify the rules and payout functions that ensure that the desired end state is achieved by assuming that the actors in this environment act rationally. Deep learning, big data and mechanisms offer exciting paths for economics (Marwala and Hurwitz, 2017)."}, {"heading": "Prospect theory", "text": "Prospectus theory offers both a fascinating alternative to modeling the behavior of agents in a virtual marketplace and the opportunity to expand prospectus theory by deploying multiple agents in a larger simulated market using multi-agent models. Prospectus theory is based on the premise that the probability of profit / loss has a disproportionate impact on the behavior of human actors in an economic system, compared to the actual expected outcome, a premise that is confirmed by the results of research in the field of behavioral economics, modeling, and theory, especially with respect to the assumption of rationality that forms the foundation of microeconomic modeling. A larger model, consisting of intelligent agents using a prospectus theory tool to determine risk, would therefore provide greater accuracy in modeling the actual market than the usual, truly rational agents in more general use. This study assumes that the applicability of the prospectus theory is determined by the level of decisiveness (the problem of the intellect used by a particular prospectus) in 2017."}, {"heading": "Efficient market hypothesis", "text": "The Efficiency Market Hypothesis (in its various forms) has, since its inception, enabled the creation of financial models based on stock price movements (Fama, 1970).This paper challenges the basic assumptions derived from basic economic principles, dissects their applicability to the actual market, highlighting both their successes and shortcomings, examines the powerful techniques available in the fields of machine learning and multi-agent modeling, and demonstrates their potential to create a new paradigm in which more precise models can be built on a basis that is a truer reflection of the underlying market.In particular, the application of multi-agent models to the market modeling problem is believed to be a powerful tool for simulating heterogeneous actors with different views and objectives in order to create a more realistic market on which our hypotheses are based."}, {"heading": "Portfolio theory", "text": "The basis of portfolio theory is based on statistical models based on Brownian movement. These models are surprisingly naive in their assumptions and the resulting application within the trading community. Applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to portfolio theory, and thus to the application of portfolio theory, especially portfolio management, has far-reaching and far-reaching consequences. Artificial intelligence techniques allow us to model price movements with much greater accuracy than the random-walk nature of the original Markowitz model, while the task of optimizing a portfolio can be accomplished with greater optimisation and portfolio theory concepts. A particular method of price movement modeling shows that price movements are modeled with simplified inputs only and still produce usable predictable results."}, {"heading": "Rationality in facts and counter-facts", "text": "In this section, the concept of rational counterfactors is presented, which is an idea of distinguishing a counterfactual reality from the actual reality (whether perceived or real), and knowledge of the laws governing the relationships between the present and the following, thereby maximizing the achievement of the desired consequence (Byrne, 2005). In counterfactual thinking, factual statements are made such as: \"Greece was financially unwise and, as a result, its finances are in tatters and with its counterfactual being:\" If Greece were financially prudent and its finances were consequently in good shape. \"To build rational counterfactors, artificial intelligence techniques can be used to identify the history that yields the desired consequence, which is considered rational (Marwala and Hurwitz, 2017)."}, {"heading": "Quantitative finance", "text": "Quantitative finance has grown with the advent of computing technology, and this growth has accelerated over the past decade with the growth of artificial intelligence. Risk assessment techniques and share price forecasting have been improved through the use of artificial intelligence. Issues such as evolution, deep learning, and big data are transforming the effectiveness of quantitative finance."}, {"heading": "Economic Causality", "text": "The evolution of causality, including the influential work of David Hume and its relevance to economics and finance, is an important area of study (Marwala and Hurwitz, 2017). Various concepts and through the use of artificial intelligence. The transmission model of causality states that for causality to exist, there should be a flow of information from cause to effect. Bayesian conclusion as a mechanism for modelling causality can be used to investigate the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer."}, {"heading": "1.5 Conclusion", "text": "This paper explored some of the great ideas developed in economics, including concepts such as Marxism, the theory of the invisible hand, rational expectations, rational decisions, mechanical design, and game theory. Furthermore, this paper discussed how some of them will change if man is replaced by an artificial intelligent machine as the main actor in economic decision-making."}], "references": [{"title": "Faraday as a Natural Philosopher", "author": ["J.
