(EC) [9] is a well-known approach to reasoning about the effects of a narrative of action occurrences (events) along a time line. This paper describes PEC, an adaptation of EC able to reason with probabilistic causal knowledge. There are numerous applications for this kind of probabilistic reasoning, e.g. in modelling medical, environmental, legal and commonsense domains, and in complex activity recognition and security monitoring. PEC\u2019s main characteristics are: i) it supports EC-style narrative reasoning, ii) it uses a possible worlds semantics to naturally allow for epistemic extensions, iii) it uses a tailored action language syntax and semantics, iv) its generality allows in principle for the use of other models of uncertainty, e.g. Fuzzy Logic [20] or Dempster-Schafer Theory [4], and v) for a wide subset of domains it has a sound and complete ASP implementation. Although other formalisms exist for probabilistic reasoning about actions, PEC is, to our knowledge, the only framework to combine these features. We use the following two example scenarios to illustrate the main definitions and characteristics of our framework.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
