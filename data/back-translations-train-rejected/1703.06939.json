Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem (DisCSP) as well as Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) are fundamental models used to solve various families of distributed problems. Even though several approaches have been proposed to quantify and preserve privacy in such problems, none of them is exempt from limitations. Here we approach the problem by assuming that computation is performed among utilitarian agents. We introduce a utilitarian approach where the utility of each state is estimated as the difference between the reward for reaching an agreement on assignments of shared variables and the cost of privacy loss. We investigate extensions to solvers where agents integrate the utility function to guide their search and decide which action to perform, defining thereby their policy. We show that these extended solvers succeed in significantly reducing privacy loss without significant degradation of the solution quality.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 19:32:40 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06939v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["julien savaux", "julien vion", "sylvain piechowiak", "ren\\'e mandiau", "toshihiro matsui", "katsutoshi hirayama", "makoto yokoo", "shakre elmane", "marius silaghi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06939"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.06939.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Distributed Constraint Problems for Utilitarian Agents with Privacy Concerns, Recast as POMDPs", "authors": ["Julien Savaux", "Julien Vion", "Sylvain Piechowiak", "Ren\u00e9 Mandiau"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is time for EU member states to agree on a solution that paves the way to the European Union in order to continue the EU accession negotiations."}, {"heading": "II.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "We describe the experimental costs of our study (V-A), and then we give the obtained results for the DMS context (V-B) A. Experimental protocol and DMS contextualWe evaluate our framework and our algorithms on randomly generated instances of distributed session problems (DMS) [37], [5], [19]. Existing studies have already addressed the issue of privacy in DMS problems by taking into account the information about whether an agent can attend a meeting in order to be private [59], [7].14The algorithm we use to generate the DMS problems is defined using the following procedure: (i) Variables are created and associated with the agent controlling them. (ii) Domains (possible values) are initialized for all variables. (iii) The global constraints of \"all variables\" are added. (iv) The unlimited (unavailability) between 9 and each are generated."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "While many approaches have recently been proposed for dealing with privacy in distributed constraints satisfaction and optimization problems, none of them are exempt from constraints. These approaches require certain characteristics of the original problem or can only take certain aspects of privacy into account. In this work, we propose the Utilitarianism Distributed Constrained Problem (UDisCP) framework, which models the loss of privacy for the disclosure of an agent's limitations as a utility function, with agents integrating privacy requirements directly into their search process. Then, the solution to the problem is to find the best compromise between solution quality and data loss, rather than just focusing on solution quality. We propose extensions of existing algorithms for DisCSPs (SyncBTU, ABTU) and DCOPs (DBOU, DSAU, and ADOPTU) that agents use privacy information to change their behavior and reduce their search process by suggesting the extent of the data loss to others, and suggesting the problems with the data loss."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The authors thank the reviewers for their constructive comments that made it possible to improve our article, which was realized while the first author was a visiting researcher at the Florida Institute of Technology (September 2015 - May 2016)."}], "references": [{"title": "Continuous search in constraint programming", "author": ["Alejandro Arbelaez", "Youssef Hamadi", "Mich\u00e8le Sebag"], "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Continuous search in constraint programming", "author": ["Alejandro Arbelaez", "Youssef Hamadi", "Michele Sebag"], "venue": "Autonomous Search,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2012}, {"title": "On the conversion between non-binary and binary constraint satisfaction problems", "author": ["Fahiem Bacchus", "Peter Van Beek"], "venue": "Proceedings of the Fifteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Tenth Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 1998}, {"title": "JADE - A java agent development framework", "author": ["Fabio Bellifemine", "Federico Bergenti", "Giovanni Caire", "Agostino Poggi"], "venue": "Multi-Agent Programming: Languages, Platforms and Applications,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2005}, {"title": "The complexity of reasoning with global constraints.

We introduce a utilitarian approach where the utility of each state is estimated as the difference between the reward for reaching an agreement on assignments of shared variables and the cost of privacy loss. We investigate extensions to solvers where agents integrate the utility function to guide their search and decide which action to perform, defining thereby their policy. We show that these extended solvers succeed in significantly reducing privacy loss without significant degradation of the solution quality.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
