Such a study often involves a small number of participants (e.g. a few dozen or a few hundred). Experimental data is often obtained by means of questionnaires, surveys or interviews. Statistical analyses such as correlation or regression analysis are often used to investigate the relationship between different test variables (e.g. East Germany and smoking habits)."}, {"heading": "3 Dataset", "text": "Our data set was obtained between 2007 and 2012 through the myPersonality project [Kosinski et al., 2015]. myPersonality was a popular Facebook application that offered users psychometric tests and feedback on their results, and the data was collected with explicit consent for further use for research purposes. myPersonality was also anonymised. Our current data set includes the Facebook likes of 11 million + users. In total, there are 9.9 million unique \"like entities (LE)\" and 1.8 billion user-like pairs. The average likes per user is 161 and the average likes per LE is 182. Figure (1a) and (1b) show the distribution of the number of likes per user and the number of likes received per LE. Both roughly follow a distribution of power. Among the 11 million Facebook users with likes, 6,330 have the GDR ground truth. Below, we explain how the ground truth was obtained."}, {"heading": "4 Ground Truth DDR", "text": "To measure DDR, various mathematical models were previously proposed, such as an exponential and a hyperbolic discount function, to better understand the relationship between discount amount and length of the reward delay. Since a hyperbolic function detects the phenomenon that a person's discount rate typically decreases when the delay of the reward increases, it better corresponds to the observed human discount behavior [Stillwell and Tunney, 2012]. Hyperbolic discount function is typically expressed as: V = A / (1 + kD), where A is the extent of a delayed reward, V is the current subjective value of that reward, and D is the delay of the delivery of the reward. The k parameter, often referred to as a delay discount rate (DDR), varies with the steepness of a person's discounting, with higher k indicating that delayed rewards lose their value faster than smaller values of the reward. In order to obtain a multifunctional Tunesic base, the Tunesic app is a delay of 50 percent of the user's default value."}, {"heading": "5 Individual User Likes and DDR", "text": "To understand the relationship between Facebook likes and GDR, we first performed a correlation analysis between each LE and GDR. Because we have a large number of unique LEs in our data set, it is difficult to perform a formal regression analysis. Instead, we used Pearson's correlation analysis to identify LEs that have a significant correlation with GDR. For this study, we used the data set with 6330 people who have both Facebook likes and their GDR ground truth. Our analysis identified 2522 LEs that are significantly correlated with GDR (p < 0.05).Table 1 shows the top 10 most positively / negatively correlated LEs. \"For those who are preferred by a\" Today \"person,\" hip-hop music / musicians dominate the list (50% of them). Animated sitcoms for adults also have significant presence (20% of them).In contrast, comics are 0.000s of GDR, the \"0.000s of a\" morning of a \"person.\""}, {"heading": "6 User Like Embedding (ULE)", "text": "Since the Ground Truth DDR can only be obtained through sophisticated psychometric testing [Stillwell and Tunney, 2012; Kirby et al., 1999], it is expensive to acquire DDR on a large scale. Consequently, the number of training instances for supervised machine learning is often limited. On the other hand, the amount of unattended social media data is enormous. To avoid a revision of the model, we initially use unattended feature arning to learn structures in user likes that are based only on unattended data. We call this process \"user like embedding\" (ULE), because we transform user likes from a high-dimensional sparse vector space into a low-dimensional dense embedding space. In addition, we filter users and LEs with a low number of likes. The threshold for user likes is 50 and LE Likes is 800. After filtering, our data set includes 5,138,857 users with Likes, 3,980 people in total, and 3,950 unique LEs."}, {"heading": "6.1 Feature Learning Methods", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to take the lead, \"he said in an interview with the German Press Agency.\" We have the opportunity to move to another world, \"he said.\" But it is not easy for us to integrate. \""}, {"heading": "6.2 Experiment Settings", "text": "With the exception of AE and GloVe, we used the implementations of Gensim Python Library 1 to perform the experiments.

With the exception of AE running on a GPU machine with 4 Quadro M6000 GPU, 1 Intel Core i75930K CPU @ 3.50GHz and 123G RAM, all other algorithms were run on a CPU machine with 40 Intel (R) Xeon (R) CPU E5-2630 @ 2.20GHz and 264G RAM.In our experiments, we systematically varied the size of the output function vectors (i.e. 50, 100, 300 and 500 mm).For models using a local context window, we set the window size to 20."}, {"heading": "6.3 Results: Correlation Analysis", "text": "To understand what was uncovered during the feature learning, we conducted a preliminary analysis of the learned fea-1https: / / github.com / RaRe-Technologies / gensim 2https: / / github.com / hans / glove.pytures and their relations to the GDR.

(b) Feature learning methods we have researched include which feature is most effective in predicting DDR. (c) What is the impact of data and feature size on prediction? To answer (a) we compare the performance of the models using the leased ULE features with baseline systems that do not use feature learning. (c) We use baselines to predict DDR directly from raw data (i.e., individual Likes). To compare prediction performance with features learned through the eight feature learning algorithms described above. To answer (c) we vary the number of users and the number of prediction functions in the training data demonstrating their impact on the predicted performance (i.e., we compare individual learning features with the prediction algorithms)."}, {"heading": "8 Discussions and Conclusions", "text": "Like many models of human behavior, the GDR is very complex and can be influenced by many factors, such as age and income [Green et al., 1996], personality [Hirsh et al., 2008], intelligence quotient (IQ) [Shamosh and Gray, 2008], and cultural differences [Du et al., 2002]. Since we have not attempted to capture all relevant factors in our model, the current goal is not to build a perfect GDR prediction system, but to gain insights into the relationship between them. Finally, in this paper we describe the first large-scale study to examine the relationship between the behavior of a user in social media (e.g. Facebook likes) and the GDR. We have explored a comprehensive set of methods of uncontrolled feature learning to exploit a large amount of uncontrolled social media data."}], "references": [{"title": "Pathological gambling severity is associated with impulsivity in a delay discounting procedure", "author": ["SM Alessi", "NM Petry"], "venue": "Behavioural Processes, 64(3):345\u2013354", "citeRegEx": "Alessi and Petry. 2003", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2003}, {"title": "The hyperbolic consumption model: Calibration", "author": ["George-Marios Angeletos", "David Laibson", "Andrea Repetto", "Jeremy Tobacman", "Stephen Weinberg"], "venue": "simulation, and empirical evaluation.
