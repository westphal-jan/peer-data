Then, we examined the intrinsic score model for compatibility, which is not only simple and direct, but also very similar to the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons. Within this model, we linked the optimal grouping with homophilic and heterophilic groupings, which are well studied in the psychological literature. We proposed the LearnOrder algorithm, which, after selecting a small number of groups, learns adaptively the best order corresponding to the score vector of the pairwise compatibility matrix. Our experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm."}], "references": [{"title": "Optimal heterophily and communication effectiveness: Some empirical findings", "author": ["M.I.
