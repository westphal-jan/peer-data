Introduction", "text": "Oppositional Learning (OBL) has become a source of numerous initiatives in the field of machine learning in artificial intelligence and related initiatives to improve metaheuristic search algorithms in optimization. Since its introduction in Tizhoosh (2005), a flood of proposals and studies have emerged to use the underlying ideas in a variety of contexts. (See, for example, the surveys by Al-Qunaieer et al, 2010, Ergezer and Sikder, 2011, Xu et al., 2014a.) An earlier framework introduced in the field of metaheuristic search (Glover, 1997; Glover and Laguna, 1997) provides a basis that summarizes many of the OBL proposals and provides a basis for further improvements. Based on this foundation, we are introducing Diversification-based Learning (DBL), which produces a collection of new strategies currently available in the OBL field."}, {"heading": "2. Background of Opposition-Based Learning", "text": "The idea of a \"counter number\" or a \"counter vector\" in OBL is closely related to the idea of a complementary solution in binary optimization. The original OBL definition is as follows."}, {"heading": "OBL Definition of an opposite number", "text": "In relation to a certain number x [L, U], the opposite number is given by x = U + L - x.It can be noted that in the case of a binary number x [0, 1], this definition exactly matches the definition of the complement of x given by x = 1 - x.The definition extends to the situation in which x is a vector, i.e., x = (xj: j N = {1,..., n}) by drawing boundaries Lj and Uj for each component xj \"of x, and generating a corresponding opposite value xj\" for each xj, \"to give the components of an opposite vector x.\" Subsequently, we will describe other definitions of an opposite number drawn from the OBL literature, we will compare with new definitions that we propose are motivated by metaheuristic considerations of diversification. Historically, OBL has applications within the continuous optimization framework, and this was found to reinforce the typical population of 2000, and the number was used by 8th."}, {"heading": "3. Related Framework from Metaheuristic Search", "text": "In OBL, as already mentioned, the term \"counter-number\" or \"counter-vector\" is closely related to the notion of a complementary solution in binary optimization. As we will show in Section 4, there is a natural way to broaden the definition of a binary complement to refer to the numbers x [L, U] (for the general lower and upper limits L and U) that allow the definition of a counter number that differs from the OBL definition (x = U + L - x) and has useful features. First, however, we are introducing a framework that can be used to exploit both the classical OBL definition and the new definitions that we will introduce later."}, {"heading": "3.1 Opposite (Diverse) Collections Versus Opposite Solutions", "text": "In the context of binary optimization, Glover (1997) proposes several diversification generators starting from an arbitrary binary vector x = (xj: j N = {1,..., n}) and creating a diverse collection of D (x) additional vectors that differ from x and from each other in different ways. (Each vector in D (x) is accompanied by its complement as a special case.) Consequently, from the perspective of oppositional learning, this approach can be interpreted as replacing the notion of an opposite solution with the notion of a diverse (\"opposite\") collection embodied in the criteria for diversification to generate D (x). (The diversification generators in Glover (1997) for creating different collections D (x) are described in the appendix, including generators for generating various permutation vectors in a sequence context, to give a clearer idea of the type of criteria that may be relevant.)"}, {"heading": "3.2 Diverse Collections and Feasibility", "text": "A key finding for exploiting a collection of \"opposites,\" embodied in a diverse collection, arises from the observation that not all elements of a collection D (x) can be permissible or workable, relative to the requirements of a given environment - i.e., there may be constraints that exclude the variable element x D (x) from its relevance. Let xo designate a solution drawn from D (x)\\ {x} (which may or may not be the complement of x) and let X designate the set of workable solutions. Then, it becomes useful to create a mapping that converts an unworkable vector xo into a workable vector xo that \"xo.For this reason, we consider a proximity function fo (x), which embodies a measure of the proximity of x to xo. Then, it becomes useful for a given xo solution (x), so that xo-xo is unworkable, we use a maximity function (exheurifo) or an exfo fo fo."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Useful and exploitable forms of X.", "text": "As an alternative to the assertion that X is the set of feasible solutions to a given problem, we can instead specify that X is a set of solutions derived from a problem tension. In this case, a solution x X that minimizes fo (x) can be used as a starting point for metaheuristic or exact algorithms that produce fully feasible solutions. In the metaheuristic environment, such algorithms can be based on neighborhood search, where feasibility can be embodied in the definitions of the neighborhoods used. In Section 5, we discuss the use of metaheuristics to generate such solutions in greater detail. If fo (x) takes the form indicated in (2) (fj oxj: j N), a number of frequently occurring types of constraints allow fo (x) to be optimized very easily. We identify some examples as follows."}, {"heading": "Multiple Choice (GUB) Constraints", "text": "These constraints are given by \u2211 (xj: j Ni) = 1, i M, where the quantities Ni, i M form a partition of N. The maximization of f o (x) over such constraints is achieved by setting xj (i) = 1 for j (i) Ni and xj = 0 for j Ni\\ {j (i)}, where j (i) = arg max (fj o: j Ni). If fj o has the elementary form in which each fj o is 1 or - 1, then each j Ni with fj o = 1 qualifies as j (i) and otherwise each j Ni as j (i) (since all coefficients fj o for j Ni are 0). Obviously, it is useful to distinguish between several optimal solutions by generating fj o coefficients that differ from 1 and - 1 (since, for example, all coefficients fj o for j Ni were determined probably or deterministically in earlier solutions)."}, {"heading": "Generalized Multiple Choice Constraints.", "text": "A generalized example of the above GUB constraints takes the form \u2211 (xj: j Ni) = mi, i Mwhere 0 < mi < | Ni |, and as before, the quantities Ni, i M form a partition of N. The set of optimal solutions consists of those which are satisfactory if j Ni (mi), i M and xj = 0 elsewhere consist of mi elements of Ni with the greatest values of fj o."}, {"heading": "A commonly encountered special case", "text": "A common version of the generalized multiple-choice constraints occurs when M contains a single element and thus yields a single constraint \u2211 (xj: j N1) = m1. For the elementary instance fo (x), in which each fj o is 1 or - 1, an optimal solution is constructed simply by observing that the set N1 (m1) consists of as many elements j N as possible with fj o = 1 (equivalent to xj o = 1) among the m1 elements of N1. The \"opposite solution\" proposed in Zhou et al. (2017) to the problem of maximum diversity corresponds to such a solution. Other useful and common types of constraints Other types of constraints that often occur in practical environments and can be easily exploited by special cases of the preceding framework include various types of network flow structures, especially those embodied in network assignments and distribution constraints."}, {"heading": "4. An Alternative Definition of Opposite Solution from the DBL perspective", "text": "First of all, we present a definition of an opposite solution that generalizes the concept of a complementary solution and shows that this definition has useful features that are missing from the classical OBL definition. Then, we show how our definition can be anchored in a framework that generalizes the framework described in Section 3. Let us consider once again the simplified situation in which x is a number that satisfies x [L, U]. As an alternative to the OBL definition of an opposite value given by x = U + L - x, we present the following notation: Lo and Uo are values that satisfy Lo L and Uo \u2264 U, where Lo is \u2264 Uo, like Lo = Lo (\u03bbL) = L + \u03bbL (U - L) and U = U - \u03bbU (U - L), for the parameters \u03bbL and \u2264 U from the semi-open interval [UL), + \u03bbL (for example) = L (L), and L (= L)."}, {"heading": "DBL Opposite Definition", "text": "x = Lo if x (Lo + Uo) / 2 and x = Uo if x \u2264 (Lo + Uo) / 2We observe that if x > (Lo + Uo) / 2 gives the preceding definition x \"= Lo and whenever x < (Lo + Uo) / 2 gives the definition x\" = Uo. \"(These results also apply if x > Uo and if x < Lo.) Both Lo and Uo qualify as the opposite of x\" when x \"is the midpoint (Lo + Uo) / 2, and in this case the bond between Lo and Uo x\" can be settled. To allow laxity in the application of this definition, Lo and Uo are qualified as the opposite of x \"if x\" is the midpoint (Lo + Uo) / 2, and in this case the bond between Lo and Uo. \""}, {"heading": "Broadened Definitions and the Max-Min Distance Principle", "text": "We will now look at several broader definitions of an opposite solution. In each of these points, x is chosen \"to be the point furthest away from x\" and subject to the constraint of being within a fixed interval of values. As in Section 3.1 above, we will look at the relationship of x \"not only to a single value x,\" but to a diverse collection X, \"where we want x\" to be in opposition to (diversified in relation to) all values x \"in X.\" One reason for introducing such a concept of opposition stems from the fact that we are looking for new solutions in population-based metaheuristics that are significantly opposite to all points in the population. Thus, we return to the perspective in which x \"and x\" are not individual values, but vectors x \"= (x1,\" x2, \"xn\") and x. \""}, {"heading": "The Max-Min Principle", "text": "For each component xj of x write the corresponding values xj 'of the vectors x' X 'as xj 1, xj 2,..., xj r, for r = | X' |, where Lj \u2264 xj 1 \u2264 xj 2,..., \u2264 xj r \u2264 Uj. For the sake of simplicity define xj 0 = Lj and xj r + 1 = Uj."}, {"heading": "The Max-Min Opposite x\" Relative to the set X'", "text": "To determine each component xj \"of x,\" identify an index h, 0 < h \u2264 r + 1 that maximizes xj h - xj h - 1. If h = 1, leave xj \"= xj 0 and if h = r + 1, leave xj\" = xj r + 1. Otherwise, leave xj \"= (xj h + xj h - 1) / 2. It is easy to verify that this determination of xj\" maximizes the minimum distance from the values xj \"for the vectors x'X.\" In addition, the result relative to each component xj \"of x\" corresponds to our previous DBL definition when we specify that xj 0 = Lj o and xj r + 1 = Uj o, where Uj o gets a value that lies between xj r and Uj, and Lj o gets a value that lies between xj 1 and Lj. In Section 6, we introduce definitions that treat min vectors as applicable by the unit, rather than by the component 1."}, {"heading": "5. Generalizing the Framework of Section 3 to Handle Non-binary Vectors", "text": "As a starting point, we consider that we can use the DBL definition of an opposite solution to map the binary solutions of a multiple collection generated by a diversification generator (like one of the ones described in the appendix), generate a multiple collection for non-binary vectors xs, and designate the collection of diverse solutions associated with xs by D # (Lj, Uj), where D # (xs) = {xs} Map xs is converted into a binary seed solution ys, where yj s = 0, if xj s (Lj + Uj) / 2and yj s = 1, if xj s (Lj + Uj) and Uxj (Uxly) are used as a diversification generator to generate a diverse collection D (ys), and if each solution yo D (ys) is turned into a solution xo D # s (s) / 2and yj s = 1, if xj (Uj) and Uj (Uj) are applied by the following (Uj) and (Uj = 1)."}, {"heading": "Generalizing the Feasibility Mapping of Section 3.", "text": "To turn a solution xo D # (xs)\\ {xs} into a practicable solution, we generalize the approach of Section 3. As in Section 3.2, we use a proximity function fo (x), which in this case we express in the form of a spacing measure between x and xo, and therefore refer to minimization rather than maximization. Thus, the goal is to minimize fo (x): x X (3), where fo (x), for example, is the formfo (x) = \u2211 (fj o | xj - xj o |): j N) (4) and fj o > 0 for all j N. If xo is binary, then (3) and (4) are equivalent to (1) and (2). In this way, we create different sets of solutions, the x X. In the contexts commonly used in OBL, in which only a single opposite solution is created, it is natural to call xo the opposite of xo."}, {"heading": "6.

Conclusions", "text": "The concept of \"opposition,\" which leads to the definitions of an opposite solution introduced in the framework of oppositional learning (OBL), can be substantially expanded by referring to earlier notions of diversification arising in the field of metaheuristic search. The resulting Diversification-based Learning System (DBL) is not only more flexible than OBL, but overcomes limitations in the OBL definitions of an opposite solution. The DBL perspective broadens the concept of opposition further by referring it not only to a single solution as the opposing partner of a given solution, but to an \"opposite collection\" of solutions as achieved by a diversification generator. These alternative notions lead to a model that allows the concept of opposition to operate within the context of feasibility that is missing in the OBL framework, except by the device of simply rejecting an opposing solution, as the distance from a point x to a cluster boundary can be defined as the scope of diversification we can take in the OBL framework."}, {"heading": "Appendix: Some Basic Diversification Generators for 0-1 Vectors", "text": "We point to two basic types of diversification generators, one for problems that can be formulated in a natural way as optimizing a function of zero-one variables, and the other for problems that can be better formulated as optimizing a permutation of elements; the generators described here are a subset of those identified in Glover (1997), and more advanced forms of these generators can be found along with additional types in Glover (2017); the following approaches embody the principle that diversification is not the same as randomization and is therefore different from the randomized approaches to generating variations that are proposed in conjunction with a variety of evolutionary approaches; the goal of diversification is to produce solutions that differ significantly from each other and, in the context of the problem under consideration, produce productive (or \"interesting\") alternatives; on the other hand, the goal of random variation is to produce solutions that can differ in some way (or systematically) from each other only as long as \"the differences can be generated on the basis of the system\" of each other."}, {"heading": "Diversification Generators for Zero-One Vectors", "text": "The first type of diversification generator takes a binary vector x as its seed solution, and generatesa collection of solutions with an integer of h = 1, 2, h *, where h * n - 1.
