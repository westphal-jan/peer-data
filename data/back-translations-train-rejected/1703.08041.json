Although it may look like a subtle difference, it completely changes the nature and complexity of the problem. For example, we show that all four problems have an efficient algorithm for a large class of election rules that includes the Borda voting rule for any coalition size. However, the tampering problem for the Borda voting rule NP is complete even if we have at least two manipulators [DKNW11, BNW11].

Of course, the process of influencing voters can come with costs even without the aspect of bribery; for example, a typical political campaign or rally involves considerable expenditures.

Voting is one of the tools of choice in these situations. Common and classic applications of voting in modern applications include collaborative filtering and recommender systems, metasearch engines, coordination and planning among multiple automated agents etc. Agents in these applications usually have computational power at their disposal. This makes the study of computational aspects of voting crucial. This thesis is devoted to a study of computational complexity of several fundamental algorithmic and complexity-theoretic problems arising in the context of voting theory. The typical setting for our work is an \u201celection\u201d; an election consists of a set of voters or agents, a set of alternatives, and a voting rule. The vote of any agent can be thought of as a ranking (more precisely, a complete order) of the set of alternatives. A voting profile comprises a collection of votes of all the agents. Finally, a voting rule is a mapping that takes as input a voting profile and outputs an alternative, which is called the \u201cwinner\u201d or \u201coutcome\u201d of the election. Our contributions in this thesis can be categorized into three parts and are described below. Part I: Preference Elicitation. In the first part of the thesis, we study the problem of eliciting the preferences of a set of voters by asking a small number of comparison queries (such as who a voter prefers between two given alternatives) for various interesting domains of preferences. We commence with considering the domain of single peaked preferences on trees in Chapter 3. This domain is a significant generalization of the classical well studied domain of single peaked preferences.
