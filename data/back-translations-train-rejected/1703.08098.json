Knowledge-based completion or linkage systems (Nickel al., 2016a) predict which triples are not likely to be true in a knowledge database (Taskar et al., 2004; Bordes et al., 2011).

Table 1 summarizes various score functions f (h, r, t) and the optimization algorithms for estimating model parameters, e.g. Vanilla Stochastic Descent (SGD), SGD + AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011), SGD + AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012) and FcS function (B function)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Specific models", "text": "The model Structured Embedding (SE) (Bordes et al., 2011) extends the unstructured model by assuming that the head and tail entities are similar only in a relationship-dependent subspace in which each relationship is represented by two different matrices. Futhermore, the model SME (Bordes et al., 2012) uses four different matrices to project entity and relationship to a subspace. The TransE model (Bordes et al., 2013) is inspired by models such as the model Word2Vec Skipgram et al., 2013), in which relationships between words often correspond with latent characteristics."}, {"heading": "3 Evaluation tasks", "text": "Two standard tasks are proposed to evaluate the embedding of models to complete KB, including: the task of predicting entities, i.e. the link prediction (Bordes et al., 2013), and the task of triple classification (Socher et al., 2013). Usually, the WN18 and FB15k (Bordes et al., 2013) data sets are used to predict entities, while the WN11 and FB13 data sets (Socher et al., 2013) are used for triple classification. WN18 and WN11 are derived from the large lexical KB WordNet (Miller, 1995).

Results are evaluated on the basis of a ranking induced by the function f (h, r, t) on test triplets. Any correct test triple (h, r, t) is corrupted by replacing either the head or tail entity with each of the possible entities, and then these candidates are ranked in ascending order of their implausibility value. This is referred to as the \"Raw\" setting protocol. Furthermore, the \"filtered\" setting protocol described in Bordes et al.

In terms of models that do not evaluate path information or external information, the ComplEx model achieves the highest values on FB15k.

(2013) and has since been used to evaluate various embedding models. The aim of this task is to predict whether a triple (h, r, t) is correct or not. A relation-specific threshold is specified for each relationship type r. If the implausibility value of an invisible test triple (h, r, t) is lower than \u03b8r, then the triple is classified as right, otherwise as wrong. According to Socher et al. (2013), the relation-specific thresholds are determined on the validation theorem by maximizing the micro-averaged accuracy, which is a triple average."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Main results", "text": "Table 4 presents the triple classification results of KB completion models on the WN11 and FB13 datasets.

Note that there are higher results1 In fact, TransE achieves very competitive performance in entity forecasting and triple classification tasks, as shown in Tables 3 and 4.
