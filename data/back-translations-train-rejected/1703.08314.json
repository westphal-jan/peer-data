We show how this approach can be generalized to conceptual space models of cognition. In order to do this, first we introduce the category of convex relations as a new setting for categorical compositional semantics, emphasizing the convex structure important to conceptual space applications. We then show how to construct conceptual spaces for various types such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. Finally we show by means of examples how concepts can be systematically combined to establish the meanings of composite phrases from the meanings of their constituent parts. This provides the mathematical underpinnings of a new compositional approach to cognition.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 08:46:48 GMT  (4206kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08314v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 29 Sep 2017 11:07:00 GMT  (2090kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08314v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.CL", "authors": ["joe bolt", "bob coecke", "fabrizio genovese", "martha lewis", "dan marsden", "robin piedeleu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08314"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.08314.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Bob Coecke", "Fabrizio Genovese", "Martha Lewis", "Dan Marsden", "Robin Piedeleu"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most people who are able, able, able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want to do are able to determine for themselves."}, {"heading": "2 Categorical compositional meaning", "text": "In this section we describe the details of the categorical compositional approach to meaning.

In this paper, we use Lambek's pregroup grammars because many grammars have a pregroup structure [28]. Moreover, pregroups can be considered compact closed categories. However, it should be stressed that our approach does not depend on pregroups and can be applied to other grammatical models. Definition 3. A pregroup is a tuple (A, \u00b7 l, \u2212 r, \u2264) where (A, \u00b7 1, \u2264) is a partially ordered monoid and \u2212 r, \u2212 l are functions A \u2192 A that represent such a constitution group."}, {"heading": "2.4 Meaning categories", "text": "Distribution models of meaning use vector spaces to represent the meaning of words. In this paper, we move away from this approach and instead opt for ConvexRel, the category of convex sets and convector relationships. Before describing this new setting, we first present the conventional vector-space approach as a demonstration of the categorical compositional method. This sets the stage for a detailed discussion of ConvexRel in later sections. One way to model meanings in a vector space is to use coexistence statistics [4]. The meaning of a word is identified by the frequency with which it appears in the vicinity of other words. First, select a collection of context words. These will be the base vectors. Then, analyze a large body of writing to determine how often words coexist with the context words. For example, suppose the word dog appears in the same context as cat, companion and vector."}, {"heading": "2.5 Putting it all together", "text": "We now have all the necessary components: a grammar category and a meaning category.

The meaning of w1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 wn is calculated as follows: 1. Assign each word a pregroup element pi based on its linguistic font.

Things become more interesting if instead of just wires we introduce the idea of a multi-wire (also called spider [8]), which can have more than two ends, or less:. The way these wires behave is exactly like wires. The only thing that matters is: \"either to be connected by a multi-wire or not.\" Consequently, several wires \"fuse\" with each other:................ These multi-wire sets can be defined in category theoretical terms for each symmetrical monoidal category, in which they are called commutative special daggers Frobenius structures. Example 7.

Concept spaces are structures based on quality dimensions such as weight, height, hue and brightness. Concept spaces are roughly interpreted as convex subsets of a concept space. Concept spaces have an internal structure based on how quality dimensions interact with each other. A pair (or set) of dimensions is called integral when assigning a value to one dimension requires assigning a value to another dimension. For example, the dimensions of color, saturation and value are integral in the HSV color space. Dimensions are called separable if values can be assigned to one dimension."}, {"heading": "4 The Category of Convex Relations", "text": "In this paper, we look at a more general constellation that includes convex subranges of vector spaces, but also allows us to look at some other, more discrete, exemplary concepts.

In our examples, we take our sentence space as a convex algebra in which the individual points are events. Our general scheme can include other sentence space structures, such decisions are generally application-specific. A sentence is then a convex subset of S. We will now describe some examples of noun and sentence spaces, and then show how they can be combined to form spaces that describe adjectives and verbs.

We consider this model as proof that we can describe convex structures within our framework. Conceptual spaces are often considered a broader mathematical structure, such as distance measurements and notions of convergence or fixed points. It is also possible to vary the concept of convexity, for example, by considering a binary relationship between convexity and convexity in a space as primitive and not as a blending operation. Finding a good environment for rich conceptual spatial models and integrating these structures into a compositional framework is one direction for further work."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partly funded by the AFSOR fellowship \"Algorithmic and Logical Aspects in Composing Meaning,\" the FQXi fellowship \"Categorical Compositional Physics\" and EPSRC doctoral fellowships."}], "references": [{"title": "A metric conceptual space algebra.

In order to do this, first we introduce the category of convex relations as a new setting for categorical compositional semantics, emphasizing the convex structure important to conceptual space applications. We then show how to construct conceptual spaces for various types such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. Finally we show by means of examples how concepts can be systematically combined to establish the meanings of composite phrases from the meanings of their constituent parts. This provides the mathematical underpinnings of a new compositional approach to cognition.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
