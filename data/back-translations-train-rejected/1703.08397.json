In standard disjunctive logic, an alternative disjunction is available: p \u00b2 and q \u00b2 r are in every extension of the theory. So, for the standard theory, which consists of p | q, and the standard theory, which consists of p \u00b2 and q \u00b2 s, we have two extensions, Cn ({p, r}) and Cn ({q, r} s is in every extension of the theory."}, {"heading": "4.2 The OR meta-rule", "text": "Another approach to handling disjunctive information is to allow conclusions that lead to new conditions > > q q from given conditions. For example, we find the following rule in system P [6] and in several input / output logics [7]: In any case, there are alternative rules that are closed after OR. For example, AT1 could be used to define an ASPIC +-like system from Section 4.1, in which arguments are constructed according to rules 1-3 in definition 4, and in which the defective rules are closed after OR. For example, this allows p \u00b2 q \u00b2 r to be derived from p \u00b2 r and q \u00b2 r, so that we can construct the argument < p \u00b2 q > r and r as a consequence."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and outlook", "text": "The ideas developed in this paper offer many interesting approaches for further work, some of which consist of removing the constraints q adopted in this paper. So, for example, we have not considered nested rbc arguments or various components that can be modeled within the ASPIC + framework, such as defective premises q that undermine or undermine attacks, and we plan to present a less cautious variant of this framework in which an attack on an rbc argument A, [B1],.. [Bn] is successful only if each of the bi's is attacked. Furthermore, we will examine prioritized standard rules within this framework. Again, new questions arise, for example, consider an argument < p \"q >, [< p > s > \u21d2 s > \u21d2 t], [< q > \u21d2 t], [< c > \u21d2 t] if an argument is not hypothetical."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "We extend the ASPIC framework for structured argumentation so<lb>as to allow applications of the reasoning by cases inference scheme for<lb>defeasible arguments.
