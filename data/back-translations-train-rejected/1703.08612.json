In settings where GPS is unavailable, range- or bearing-only observations relative to a set of fixed beacons provide an effective means of estimating a robot's location as it navigates. The accuracy of such a beacon-based localization system depends both on how beacons are spatially distributed in the environment, and how the robot's location is inferred based on noisy measurements of range or bearing. However, it is computationally challenging to search for a placement and an inference strategy that, together, are optimal. Existing methods decouple these decisions, forgoing optimality for tractability. We propose a new optimization approach to jointly determine the beacon placement and inference algorithm. We model inference as a neural network and incorporate beacon placement as a differentiable neural layer. This formulation allows us to optimize placement and inference by jointly training the inference network and beacon layer. We evaluate our method on different localization problems and demonstrate performance that exceeds hand-crafted baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 21:57:37 GMT  (1164kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08612v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 20 Sep 2017 16:56:43 GMT  (2549kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08612v2", "Appeared at 2017 International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.LG", "authors": ["charles schaff", "david yunis", "ayan chakrabarti", "matthew r walter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08612"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.08612.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Jointly Optimizing Placement and Inference for Beacon-based Localization ", "authors": ["Charles Schaff", "David Yunis", "Ayan Chakrabarti", "Matthew R.

APPROACH", "text": "We formalize the design problem for a site perception system as the problem of determining an optimal distribution of beacons D and a deduction function f (\u00b7) against an environment E. For a given set of possible L locations for beacons, we parameterize the distribution D as an assignment Il to each location l (1,.. L), where Il (0, 1) C + 1, | Il | = 1 is a (C + 1) dimension 0-1 vector with all but one entry equal to 0. This vector indicates whether a beacon should be placed at position l (otherwise I1l = 1), and if so, in which one of the possible C configurations (i.e. Ic + 1l = 1 for configuration c). We parameterize the environment with respect to a function s = E (v, {Il}), where a location v (R2) and a distribution of beacons D = {Il} results in a vector s (Rm = 1 for configuration c)."}, {"heading": "A. Optimization with Gradient Descent", "text": "Unfortunately, the above problem concerns a combinatorial search, since the space of possible beacon distributions with (C + 1) L elements is discrete. We make the optimization tractable by applying an approach similar to that of Chakrabarti. We relax the allocation vectors Il to be real evaluated and positive, as we learn a weight vector (RC + 1) that identifies the weight vectors (RC + 1) with the weight vectors (RC + 1). We learn a weight vector (RC + 1) with the weight vectors (RC + 1)."}, {"heading": "B. Application to RF-based Localization", "text": "To give a concrete example of an application of this framework, we consider the following candidates setting the localization with RF beacon = \u03b2 beacon. We assume that each beacon transmits a sinusoidal signal at one of the C frequencies / channels. The amplitude of this signal for each beacon is assumed to be fixed, but we allow different beacons to have arbitrary phase variations among themselves. We assume that one actor in one place has a receiver with several bandpass filters and is able to measure the power in each channel separately (i.e. m = C). We assume that the power of each beacon signal decreases as a function of distance and the number of obstacles (e.g. walls) in the line of sight between the actor and the beacle. The measured power at each channel is based on the amplitude of the superposition of the signals transmitted in that channel."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "In this section, we evaluate our method through a series of simulation-based experiments on two different environment maps, learning a neural network for the sequence function. For each map, we look at several manual beacon distributions and show that the network architecture we choose is able to localize effectively against these distributions by comparing their results to a simple baseline nearby. We then show the results of learning the beacon distribution and inference networks together, and show that our method learns a more optimal distribution strategy for both environments, leading to better localization accuracy. We end the section by providing the reader with an analysis of the effects of different degrees of regulation and variation of learned distributions based on parameters of environment function E."}, {"heading": "A. Experimental Setup", "text": "We perform our experiments on two manually drawn ambient maps that correspond to the ground plans (the size 1 x 0.7 distance units), with walls as obstacles. For each map, we arrange L = 625 possible lighthouse positions in a 25 x 25 uniformly matched grid. We consider configurations with values of C = 4, 8 and 16 RF channels. Our experiments use the environmental model defined in Equation 3 with P0 = 6.25 x 10 \u2212 4, 0 = 2.0 (where the locations are in map units) and \u03b2 = e \u2212 1.0, with the deviation of sensor noise \u03c32z = 10 \u2212 4. The sensor measurements are saturated at a threshold between zw = 1.0, while we train the lighthouses, we use the parameters \u03b10 = 1 and for the square temperature scheme \u03b3 = 1.25 x 10 \u2212 9. These values were selected empirically so that the light vector selectors flow at the same tempo as the invergence I \u00b2."}, {"heading": "B. Experiments", "text": "We evaluate the effectiveness of our inference network as well as the joint optimization of the positioning and localization of beacons. To this end, we compare our method with two baseline. First, we compare our inference network with a kNearest Neighbor (kNN) baseline using handmade beacon placements. Training data for the kNN experiments were compiled using samples from our environmental model on a dense grid for each map. We conducted experiments with k = 1, 5, 10 and 20 and compared our model with the best k for each beacon placement. We measure the performance of each model with both the mean of the square (RMSE) and the mean above the maximum errors at each location, which we refer to as Max Errors. The effects of the interference on performance may vary greatly between the different beacon placements. Therefore, it is useful to compare both the average performance of the respective model and the performance of the worst cases with the table of these places, as some of the results may be more susceptible to learning."}, {"heading": "PERFORMANCE ON MAP 1", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "PERFORMANCE ON MAP 2", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "STABILITY WITH REGULARIZATION", "text": "Developing the positioning of lighthouses throughout the training for our best functioning models. Note that the images represent a hard mapping, but the network thinks about high entropy positioning early in the training, which explains the initial scarcity. With both maps, the network quickly bundles a large number of lighthouses by channel and gradually learns to reduce the number of lighthouses and increase channel diversity, resulting in a stable configuration. Results show that our inference network can effectively learn to locate the agent equipped with a fixed lighthouse placement, and also show that learning this positioning delivers accuracies that exceed those of handmade lighthouses, using significantly fewer lighthouses."}, {"heading": "ENVIRONMENT MODEL EXPERIMENTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CHANNEL EXPERIMENTS", "text": "To test the robustness to random initialization, we repeat an experiment ten times and give the mean and variance of the mean error in Table III. Then we test our method on two different environmental models, one with reduced wall attenuation (\u03b2 = e \u2212 0.2) and one with increased noise (\u03c32z = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4). Table IV presents the results. We find that our method intuitively adapts to these changes. Our method uses less beacons when the signal travels largely undiminished through walls, and uses more beacons to combat increased noise. Finally, we experiment with 4 and 16 channels. Unsurprisingly, an increase in the number of channels increases the performance of both hand-made and learned beacons. The results are shown in Table V."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "We described a novel learning-based method for jointly optimizing beacon allocation (placement and channel assignment) and localization conclusions. Our method is based on a neural network formulation of inference with an additional differentiable neural layer encoding the beacon distribution. By jointly training the inference network and the beacon layer, we automatically learn the optimal design of a spatial awareness system for any environment. We evaluated our method for the task of RFbased localization and demonstrated localization accuracies that exceed those that can be achieved with handmade assignment strategies. Additionally, we analyzed the performance of our method under different dispersion models and presented a strategy for trading with the number of beacons and achievable accuracy. While describing our method in the context of range-based localization, the approach generalizes to problems where a broader class of spatial phenomena must be estimated using sensors."}, {"heading": "VI.

operations. In settings where GPS is unavailable, rangeor bearing-only observations relative to a set of fixed beacons provide an effective means of estimating a robot\u2019s location as it navigates. The accuracy of such a beacon-based localization system depends both on how beacons are spatially distributed in the environment, and how the robot\u2019s location is inferred based on noisy measurements of range or bearing. However, it is computationally challenging to search for a placement and an inference strategy that, together, are optimal. Existing methods decouple these decisions, forgoing optimality for tractability. We propose a new optimization approach to jointly determine the beacon placement and inference algorithm. We model inference as a neural network and incorporate beacon placement as a differentiable neural layer. This formulation allows us to optimize placement and inference by jointly training the inference network and beacon layer. We evaluate our method on different localization problems and demonstrate performance that exceeds hand-crafted baselines.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
