As seen in the previous section, most computerized approaches deal with Semitic morphology (as one would do for Arabic or its varieties) or with a system based on tribal and affix (as in Italian). Therefore, we might expect certain methods to work differently depending on which component we are looking at. Indeed, general accuracy numbers could mask interesting differences between the different components. Maltese words of Semitic origin tend to have considerable stem variations (not concatenated), while word formation from Romance / English origin would generally leave whole (concatenated words) behind. Maltese offers an ideal scenario for this type of analysis due to their mixed morphology. Often, cluster techniques would either be sensitive to a particular language, such as catering for weak consonants in Arabic (2001 and Al-Fares) or English only."}, {"heading": "3.1 Words removed from clusters", "text": "As an indicator of the quality of a cluster, the analysis considers the number of words that experts have removed from a cluster - indicating that the word does not belong to a cluster. Table 4 indicates the percentage of words that have been removed from clusters, divided by whether the morphological system involved is chained or not chained. The percentage of clusters left intact by the experts was higher for the chained group (61%) than for the unchained group (45%). The gap closes when looking at the percentage of clusters where a third or more of their words have been removed (not chained at 25% and chained at 20%). However, the chained group also pointed to clusters where more than 80% of their words have been removed, suggesting that the cluster technique generally works better in the chained case, there are cases where bad clusters are formed by the techniques used."}, {"heading": "3.2 Quality ratings of clusters", "text": "Experts were asked to rate the quality of a cluster, and although this is a rather subjective opinion, the correlation between this judgment and the number of words removed was calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Trends are consistent with the analysis in the previous subsection; Table 5 shows the breakdown of quality ratings for clusters divided between the two processes, and the correlation of quality with the percentage of words removed. Unlinked clusters generally have lower quality ratings compared to the linked clusters, but both groups exhibit a strong correlation between the percentage of words removed and the quality rating, which clearly indicates that the perception of the quality of a cluster is related to the percentage of words removed."}, {"heading": "3.3 Hybridity in clustering", "text": "It is clear that there is a remarkable difference between clustering words from concatenated and unconcatenated morphological processes, both of which have their strengths and pitfalls, but neither of these processes excels or stands out from the others. One of the problems with unconcatenated clusters was the order of magnitude. However, the initial clusters were formed on the basis of the strains, and due to ancestry variation, the unconcatenated clusters were rather small. In fact, although the fusion process provided clusters that are composed and form larger clusters, the process was limited to a maximum of two merging operations, which may not be enough for the small unconcatenated clusters to verify clustering. In fact, only 10% of the NC clusters contained 30 or more words, when compared to 22% of the concatenated clusters. Limiting the merger in this way may have led to a few missed opportunities. This is because there are likely to be a lot of derived forms that are difficult to locate due to alignment."}, {"heading": "4 Classifying morphological properties", "text": "In our approach, morphological labeling is considered a classification problem, with each morphological characteristic being considered a classifiable characteristic. Thus, the analysis of a particular word can be regarded as a sequence of classification problems, each of which assigns a name to the word that reflects one of its morphological characteristics. We refer to such a sequence of classifiers as a \"cascade.\" In this essay, we focus in particular on the verb category, which morphologically is one of the richest categories in Maltese. The most important question is whether there is a difference in the performance of the classification system when applied to lexemes formed by linking or unlinking processes. Our main focus is on the classification of inflection verb characteristics. While these are attached to the strain, the main question is whether the cotraining of the classification sequence on an undifferentiated training set is adequate on both, via a tempera derived trait."}, {"heading": "4.1 The classification system", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to move to another world in which they are able to integrate, and in which they are able, in which they are able to assert themselves."}, {"heading": "4.2 Evaluation Results", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that they are both very complex matters, which are very complex, complex and complex matters."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors acknowledge the insights and expertise of Prof. Ray Fabri.
