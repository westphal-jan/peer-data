We identify two important tasks to solve towards this objective, 1 group students so that they can maximally benefit from peer interaction and 2 find an optimal schedule of the educational material for each group. Thus, in this paper, we solve the problem of team formation and content scheduling for education. Given a time frame d, a set of students S with their required need to learn different activities T and given k as the number of desired groups, we study the problem of finding k group of students. The goal is to teach students within time frame d such that their potential for learning is maximized and find the best schedule for each group. We show this problem to be NP-hard and develop a polynomial algorithm for it. We show our algorithm to be effective both on synthetic as well as a real data set. For our experiments, we use real data on students' grades in a Computer Science department. As part of our contribution, we release a semi-synthetic dataset that mimics the properties of the real data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Mar 2017 03:47:54 GMT  (704kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08762v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sanaz bahargam", "d\\'ora erdos", "azer bestavros", "evimaria terzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08762"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.08762.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Team Formation for Scheduling Educational Material in Massive Online Classes", "authors": ["Sanaz Bahargam", "D\u00f3ra Erd\u0151s", "Azer Bestavros", "Evimaria Terzi"], "emails": ["evimaria]@cs.bu.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Tags Teambuilding; Clustering; Partitioning; Teams; MOOC; Large Classes"}, {"heading": "1.

We review some of these papers here: Ability grouping: The majority of studies in this area find that there is definitely a gain in academic performance due to the ability to group [17, 39, 24, 21, 9]. Most studies agree that there is a high increase in the learning of students in highly qualified groups.

Then, we proceed to present our solution, CohPart to the Cohort Selection and a Sampling-based speedup, CohPart _ S.Random Partitioning is a cluster method used to minimize the average square distance between points in the same cluster. We use this partitioning as a starting point to compare our algorithms with others. [18] Exactly, NP-hard. Lloyd's algorithm [28] solves this problem by randomly selecting the centers and assigning the points to the closest center. Then, the centers are recalculated based on the points assigned to them. These two phases are repeated until there is no further improvement in the cost of clustering."}, {"heading": "5.2 Constraints on Topic Order", "text": "In real life, we can usually not choose topics we like, instead there are strict precedence constraints between topics. For example, you first have to learn addition before you can learn about multiplication in a math course. Therefore, we assume that there are a number of constraints in addition to the topics. The constraints can be simple, like the first occurrence of topic ti before topic tj or more complicated, topic tj can only be scheduled after at least r1 repetitions of ti1 and r2 repetitions of ti2. Of course, the set of constraints can also be empty if we do not have one. We can easily change algorithm 1 to take these constraints into account and check for precedence constraints. To achieve this, we can check for precedence constraints after line 4 and select only those topics in line 5 that meet their precedence constraints."}, {"heading": "6. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "The goal of these experiments is to gain an understanding of how our cluster algorithm works in terms of performance (objective function). In addition, we want to understand how the deadline parameter affects our algorithm. We used a real dataset, semi-synthetic and synthetic datasets. The semi-synthetic dataset and the source code to generate it are available on our website. We first introduce the Graded Response Model (GRM) briefly, then explain various datasets and finally show how well our algorithm is doing on each dataset. Item Response Theory and Graded Response Model: In psychometry, Item Response Theory (IRT) is a framework for designing and evaluating tests, questions and quick-tionnails. In IRT models, the likelihood that a student will give a correct answer to a question is determined based on the ability of the student and the difficulty of the question. For our work we used the advanced GRM model, the GRM, the GRM model for our students, and then the GRM model for the GRM we used."}, {"heading": "6.1 Datasets", "text": "This subsection describes the individual data sets and their attributions.

Each set of data looked like this: Case 2003, CS101, U12345, U1, C +, which consisted of the semester, the number of courses, the students' BU id, undergraduate / graduate year and the grade. It consists of 9833 students. We looked only at students who CS330 and CS210 (required courses to get a major in CS), which consisted of 398 students and 41 courses. Here, the courses correspond to topics. Obviously, the new datasets are some missing values, not all 41 courses were taken by these 398 students. To fill the grades for missing (students, course) pairs, we used GRM, we have obtained the ability and difficulty parameters for all courses."}, {"heading": "6.2 Results:", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION", "text": "We proposed a novel cluster algorithm to form different teams and teach team members different topics based on their skills.

The encouraging results we achieved show that our proposed solution is effective and suggest that we need to consider personalised tuition for students and build more efficient teams."}, {"heading": "8.

We identify two important tasks to solve towards this objective; (1.) group students so that they can maximally benefit from peer interaction and (2.) find an optimal schedule of the educational material for each group. Thus, in this paper, we solve the problem of team formation and content scheduling for education. Given a time frame d, a set of students S with their required need to learn different activities T and given k as the number of desired groups, we study the problem of finding k group of students. The goal is to teach students within time frame d such that their potential for learning is maximized and find the best schedule for each group. We show this problem to be NP-hard and develop a polynomial algorithm for it. We show our algorithm to be effective both on synthetic as well as a real data set. For our experiments, we use real data on students\u2019 grades in a Computer Science department. As part of our contribution, we release a semi-synthetic dataset that mimics the properties of the real data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
