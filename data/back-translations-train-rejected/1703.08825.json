Classification Accuracy of SVDD Models", "text": "The other analysis in terms of the performance of the algorithm relates to the evaluation of the SVDD classification accuracy of multi-stage trajectories = 98. With this aim, two different sets of trajectories were used: a set composed of feasible trajectories and a second set of unfeasible trajectories. The purpose of using these two sets relates to the need to evaluate the classification process not only for the correct classification of feasible trajectories, but also for the correct identification of unfeasible trajectories. In terms of the SVDD function, hyperparameters had to be defined before the construction of the classification models. These hyperparameters are the kernel type and coefficient (\u03b3), which will affect the quality of the classification performance. For this problem, it was found that the most suitable type of the kernel was the sigmoid, whereas in Table 1 the performance results for this core type together with the results from the models that were based on the polyalkaline function was strong."}, {"heading": "5.
