Traditional RE systems have focused on identifying and extracting relationships of interest by taking the target relationships as input, along with handmade extraction patterns or patterns learned from hand-labeled training examples. As a result, moving to a new domain requires first specifying the target relationships and then manually creating new extraction rules or commenting new training examples by hand (Banko and Etzioni, 2008). Since these manual workscales are linear with the number of target relationships, this supervised approach does not require scaling to large, heterogeneous companies, which are likely to include a variety of unexpected relationships (Schmidek and Barbosa, 2014). To address this problem, Banko and Etzioni (2008) are developing a new extraction parameter called \"Open Relationship\" that facilitates the discovery of fear."}, {"heading": "2 System Description", "text": "In fact, the idea of our text simplification framework is to replace a complex input sentence by splitting coherent clauses into individual sentences and removing specific syntactical sub-structures, namely those that contain little information. Unlike other approaches to extractive sentence compression, we have not deleted these sentences, which would result in a loss of background information, but rather aim to preserve the full informative content of the original sentence. Thus, on the basis of syntax-driven heuristics, components that typically only provide secondary context sentences are adopted by means of paraphrasing operations. Defining the rules of simplification By analyzing the structure of hundreds of examples from English Wikipedia, we have determined election judgments that do not typically provide stand-alone context sentences."}, {"heading": "4 Usage", "text": "The Text Simplification Framework is available to the public both as a library and as a command-line tool, the workflow of which is illustrated in Figure 1. It takes NL text as input either in the form of a single sentence or a file with line-separated sentences. As described above, each input sentence is first converted into a structurally simplified version, consisting of 1 to n core sentences and 0 to m associated context sentences. In a second step, the relationships contained in the input are extracted by applying the Open IE System3 to the simplified sentences. Finally, the results thus generated are written to the console or a specific output file in JSON format. As an example, the result that our simplification system generates when applied to a complete Wikipedia article.4"}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have described a syntax-based framework for simplifying texts that simplifies the linguistic structure of input sentences, with the aim of improving the coverage of modern Open-RE systems. Experimental analysis has shown that simplifying text before processing improves the outcome of current Open-RE approaches, resulting in less loss of information and greater accuracy of extracted relationships."}], "references": [{"title": "Leveraging linguistic structure for open domain information extraction", "author": ["Angeli et al.2015] Gabor Angeli", "Melvin Johnson Premkumar", "Christopher D.
