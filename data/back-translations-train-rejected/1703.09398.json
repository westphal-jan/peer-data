Fake news is not a new problem and its spread in social networks is well-studied. Often an underlying assumption in fake news discussion is that it is written to look like real news, fooling the reader who does not check for reliability of the sources or the arguments in its content. Through a unique study of three data sets and features that capture the style and the language of articles, we show that this assumption is not true. Fake news in most cases is more similar to satire than to real news, leading us to conclude that persuasion in fake news is achieved through heuristics rather than the strength of arguments. We show overall title structure and the use of proper nouns in titles are very significant in differentiating fake from real. This leads us to conclude that fake news is targeted for audiences who are not likely to read beyond titles and is aimed at creating mental associations between entities and claims.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 04:47:11 GMT  (599kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09398v1", "Published at The 2nd International Workshop on News and Public Opinion at ICWSM"]], "COMMENTS": "Published at The 2nd International Workshop on News and Public Opinion at ICWSM", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL", "authors": ["benjamin d horne", "sibel adali"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09398"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.09398.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "This Just In: Fake News Packs a Lot in Title, Uses Simpler, Repetitive Content in Text Body, More Similar to Satire than Real News", "authors": ["Benjamin D.

Given its data source, this study aims to identify subtle differences in narration between different stories that are not well suited for news articles. Similarly, Burfoot and Baldwin use SVMs on lexical and semantic characteristics to automatically classify true news content as satire content. Content features are specifically targeted at satire and achieve high classification precision.

To capture the differences in syntax, we use the Python Language Toolkit (Bird 2006) Parts of the Language (POS) tagger and keep a count of how often each word appears in the article. Along with this, we track the number of stopwords, quotes, biases, biases (no, not), questions (how, why), and words that occur in all uppercase letters."}, {"heading": "Statistical Tests and Classification", "text": "Since we use small data sets and a large number of characteristics, we decide to first address the problem with two well-known hypotheses testing methods, the disposable ANOVA test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test, to determine which characteristics differ between the different categories of novelty. In our case, a one-sided ANOVA test is used to compare the means of different groups on a dependent variable. ANOVA uses the ratio of treatment and residual variances to determine whether the difference in group means is due to random variation or treatment. In our case, the treatment groups news as fake, real or satire. ANOVA assumes that the variables are roughly normally distributed. While these assumptions apply to most of our characteristics, we cannot assume that they apply to all of them. Therefore, we also use the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare two distributions that are not normal."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them are able to survive themselves without there being a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is"}], "references": [{"title": "L", "author": ["E.
