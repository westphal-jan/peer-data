In fact, in the face of an item set X and an item set i, we can see that i-X and i-X-t ({i) | t ({j}) | Cosine (X) and Cosine (X) cannot decrease because the itemset support cannot increase while the mean value cannot decrease in this case."}, {"heading": "4.2 Stability and Robustness of an Itemset", "text": "Stability [Kuz07] and robustness [TMC14] are similar metrics when applied to closed item sets.

In addition, the calculation of data for an itemset requires either a known partial order of itemsets or a search for its offspring (closed supersets). Therefore, as approximate competitors, we have decided to use two algorithms LCMv3 [ZH05]."}, {"heading": "5.2 Scalability", "text": "First, we can measure the time it takes to find top L concepts, i.e. how the memory constraint L changes efficiency, as shown in Table 4 for the same datasets. We can see that the calculation time changes linearly, as expected by Equation. (3) Finally, we check how the calculation time depends on the size of the dataset. To do this, we conduct our experiments for L = 1000 and vary the number of transactions in a dataset. We permutate the transaction sequence of the dataset several times. For each permutation, we construct datasets that contain a certain amount (the size of the dataset) of the first transactions from that permutation. Calculation time is averaged over the permutations. Figure 2 shows the calculation time it takes to process a certain fraction of the transactions in the dataset."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced a new class of metrics for interest, the so-called projection antimonotonous metrics. This broad class of metrics includes classical anti-monotonous, locally anti-monotonous and some non-monotonous metrics. We have introduced an algorithm that enables patterns to be efficiently broken down. We have studied stability and robustness, introduced two projection antimonotonous metrics and polynomial estimates of these metrics, the so-called \u0394-measure. Finally, in the experimental part, we have shown that we can find stable metrics much more efficiently than subsequent approaches. Many approaches for future work are promising. First, we should work on adapting communication projects to deal with different types of pattern structures, e.g. based on sequences or diagrams. Second, the introduction of new data mining approaches through projections of a specific kind, so that it is possible to study other types of measurements for stability and stability [05]."}], "references": [{"title": "Fast algorithms for mining association rules", "author": ["Rakesh Agrawal", "Ramakrishnan Srikant"], "venue": "In Proc. 20th int. conf. very large data bases, VLDB,", "citeRegEx": "Agrawal and Srikant.,? \\Q1994\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Agrawal and Srikant.", "year": 1994}, {"title": "Listing closed sets of strongly accessible set systems with applications to data mining", "author": ["Mario Boley", "Tam\u00e1s Horv\u00e1th", "Axel Poign\u00e9", "Stefan Wrobel"], "venue": "Theor.
