Humour, which is a potential cause of laughter, is an essential component of human communication. It not only allows people to feel comfortable, but also creates a more comfortable environment. While humor has been studied from a psychological, cognitive [8] and even linguistic [16] perspective, its investigation from a mathematical point of view is still an area that needs to be explored within computational linguistics. There are some previous works [14]; a humorous characterisation that enables its automatic recognition and generation, however, is far from being specified, especially for Spanish languages.The identification of humor in a text can be seen as an intermediate step for solving more complex tasks. It would be interesting to create jokes or humor humor in general, based on the knowledge of which attributes enrich texts that we use in a better way.Another attractive use case is to exploit the result of a humorous detector."}, {"heading": "2 Computational Humor", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to help themselves, to help themselves, cannot put themselves in danger.

Therefore, we have developed two basic lines to compare it with, with the aim that these are simple ideas that can be created to accomplish this task. The first (BL1) is a Multinomical Naive Bayes Classifier, combined with a bag of words, similar to the feature \"Topic Distance.\" The second (BL2) is a classifier that predicts all tweets with the most likely result, non-humorous, with a frequency of almost 83%. A comparison mainly with the F1 score is intended. We want to take into account the positive (humorous), but also false positives and false negatives in equal measure. Nevertheless, we use the runs to pay attention to other measurements as well. The best results are obtained with SVM, even in terms of accuracy."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "A crowdsourcing corpus has been put together that serves the purpose of this work and could be useful for future research. It contains over 30,000 comments on 16,488 tweets coming from humorous accounts, and it also counts 22,875 coming from non-humorous accounts. Uses of such a corpus include analyzing its data and performing tasks similar to the work described here. We have created a classifier that outlines the basics outlined. Vector Machine support proved to be the best technique. It has an accuracy of 83.6%, a recall rate of 68.9%, an F1 score of 75.5% and an accuracy of 92.5%. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that the built corpus does not represent a great variety of humor. Therefore, some features in this work perform well, but in another context may not perform so well. As a future work, more complex features could be created, such as a plurality of words, an attempt at plurality of words, and an advantage over other areas."}], "references": [{"title": "Script theory revis(it)ed: Joke similarity and joke representation model", "author": ["S.
