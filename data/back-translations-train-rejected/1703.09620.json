Universal logic reasoning in turn, as envisioned already by Leibniz, may support the rigorous formalisation and deep logical analysis of rational arguments within machines. A respective universal logic reasoning framework is described and a range of exemplary applications are discussed. In the future, universal logic reasoning in combination with appropriate, controlled forms of rational argumentation may serve as a communication layer between humans and intelligent machines.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 15:00:57 GMT  (257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09620v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["christoph benzm\\\"uller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09620"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.09620.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Universal Reasoning, Rational Argumentation and Human-Machine Interaction", "authors": ["Christoph Benzm\u00fcller"], "emails": ["christoph.benzmueller@uni.lu", "c.benzmueller@fu-berlin.de"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Rational Argumentation \u2013 Communication Interface between Humans and Machines", "text": "The ambition to understand, model and implement rational reasoning and universal logical reasoning independently of the human brain has a long tradition in the history of mankind, dating back at least to Aristotle's prominent study of syllogistic arguments. Today, with increasingly intelligent computer technology, the question is more topical than ever: if humans and intelligent machines are to coexist, interact and cooperate amicably, appropriate forms of communication between them are needed. Machines should be able to present, evaluate and defend their (action) arguments and decisions in a form accessible to human understanding and judgment, which will be crucial to achieving a conciliatory and socially accepted integration of intelligent machines into everyday (human) life. Ideally, the means of communication between machines and humans should be based on human level, rational reasoning that has always been the foundation of our social, legal and scientific processes. Current developments in artificial intelligence, on the other hand, place a strong focus on human intelligence, statistical information, symbolic machine learning and representation, all of which are dependent on detailed machine learning and human explanations."}, {"heading": "2 Leibniz\u2019 Vision", "text": "The search for a universal framework that supports universal thinking and rational reasoning is very prominent in the works of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), who envisioned a scientia generalis based on a characteristica universalis, i.e. a highly universal formal language in which all knowledge (and all arguments) about the world and the sciences can be encoded. Leibniz said that this universal framework of logic should be supplemented by a calculus ratiocinator, an associated, universally valid formal calculation in which the truth of propositions expressed in the characteristica universalis should be mechanically evaluated by computation.1 Leibniz, for example, imagines that disputes between philosophers could be resolved by formalization and calculation: \"If this is done, there is no need to argue between two philosophers, than to argue between two philosophers, than between two mathematicians. Because it will be enough to put oneself in the palm and the hand."}, {"heading": "3 Zoo of Logical Formalisms", "text": "It's not as if it's a purely theoretical question, but a purely theoretical question.

However, the experience from the pilot studies mentioned below is that the approach is indeed consistent with and may even exceed human reasoning capabilities in individual areas of application (e.g. errors in human referenced research and textbooks)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Philosophy", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be a matter of time before it is so far, until it is so far."}, {"heading": "5.2 Mathematics", "text": "Free logic. Outstanding, open challenges for formalization in mathematics (and beyond) are dealing with partiality and clear descriptions. Free logic (Lambert, 2012; Scott, 1987) adapts classical logic in a way that is particularly suitable for dealing with such challenges. Free logic has interesting applications, e.g. in the processing of natural language and as a logic of fiction. In mathematics, free logic is particularly suitable for areas of application such as category theory or projective geometry (e.g. morphism composition in category theory is a partial operation). Similar to the other non-classical logic mentioned above, free logic can be elegantly embedded in HOL (Benzm\u00fcller and Scott, 2016). Benefiting from this embedding of Scott's (1987) approach of free logic in HOL, a systematic development of theory in category theory has recently been contributed. In this exemplary study, six different, but closely related, technical systems have been applied to HOL in HOL."}, {"heading": "5.3 Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science", "text": "Most of the logic mentioned above (and the corresponding experiments) are obviously also relevant for applications in artificial intelligence and computer science. Further relevant experiments are: Epistemic and doxastic logic. Epistemic logic supports e.g. the modelling of the knowledge of rational agents. Doxastic logic is about the modelling of the beliefs of agents. Both are only certain multimodal logic and thus enable the semantic embedding approach. Respectful experiments show that the approach actually works well to elegantly solve prominent mysteries about knowledge and belief in artificial intelligence (Benzm\u00fcller, 2011; Steen et al., 2016), including the well-known smart men puzzling and muddy children. 17The sources of formalizing Fitting's work can be found at http: / github.com / cbenzmueller / TypesTableauxAndGoedelsGod.Time and Space."}, {"heading": "6 Summary and Outlook", "text": "The semantic embedding approach, which uses the classical higher order logic at the meta-level to encode a wide range of non-classical logic (combinations thereof), has many applications, e.g. in artificial intelligence, computer science, philosophy, mathematics, and (deep) natural language processing. The range of possible applications of this universal reasoning approach is wide-ranging and, as has been shown, even indirectly scales to non-trivial rational arguments, including masterful arguments in philosophy. A relevant and challenging future direction of application concerns the application of the semantic embedding approach to the modelling of ethical, legal, social, and cultural norms in intelligent machines, ideally in combination with the translation of human-intuitive forms of rational arguments into machines that complement internal decision-making."}], "references": [{"title": "The tableaux work bench", "author": ["P.

Universal logic reasoning in turn, as envisioned already by Leibniz, may support the rigorous formalisation and deep logical analysis of rational arguments within machines. A respective universal logic reasoning framework is described and a range of exemplary applications are discussed. In the future, universal logic reasoning in combination with appropriate, controlled forms of rational argumentation may serve as a communication layer between humans and intelligent machines. 1 Rational Argumentation \u2013 Communication Interface between Humans and Machines The ambition to understand, model and implement rational argumentation and universal logical reasoning independent of the human brain has a long tradition in the history of humankind. It reaches back at least to the prominent study of syllogistic arguments by Aristoteles. Today, with the event of increasingly intelligent computer technology, the question is more topical than ever: if humans and intelligent machines are supposed to amicably coexists, interact and collaborate, appropriate forms of communication between them are required. For example, machines should be able to depict, assess and defend their (options for) actions and decisions in a form that is accessible to human understanding and judgement. This will be crucial for achieving a reconcilable and socially accepted integration of intelligent machines into everyday (human) life. The communication means between machines and humans should ideally be based on human-level, rational argumentation, which since ages forms the fundament of our social, juridical and scientific processes. Current developments in artificial intelligence, in contrast, put a strong focus on statistical information, machine learning and subsymbolic representations, all of which are rather detached from human-level rational explanation, understanding and judgement. The challenge thus is to complement and enhance these human-unfriendly forms of reasoning and knowledge representation in todays artificial intelligence systems with suitable explanations amenable to human cognition, that is, rational arguments. Via exchange of rational arguments at human-intuitive level the much needed mutual understanding and acceptance between humans and intelligent machines can eventually be guaranteed. This is particularly relevant for the assessment of machine actions in terms of legal, ethical, moral, social and cultural norms purported by humans. But what formalisms are available that could serve as a most general basis for the modeling of human-level rational arguments in machines?", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
