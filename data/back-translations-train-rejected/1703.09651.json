Dimensionality Reduction", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 PCA of the Frequency Response Function", "text": "Principal Uni Component Analysis (PCA) [14], [15] is a statistical method that allows to identify the main directions in which the data vary. A key application of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem in the case where eigenvalues cover a wide dynamic range. In particular, it allows to identify the main directions in which the data vary. Principal components are completely equivalent to determining the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix: each eigenvector gives a major component. The corresponding eigenvalue represents the variance of this main component, and the main components with the largest deviations are the most important. In order to produce damage indices that are feasible for neural network training, the size of the damage quantities (FRFs) must be greatly reduced. For the stiffened panel structure is a complete FRF structure that covers a frequency range from 0 to 1000 Hz."}, {"heading": "2.2 Damage fingerprint in the reduced FRF", "text": "Dimensionality reduction using PCA leads to a fingerprint of the damage scenario on the reduced data. Figures 1 below show the main component variation for different damage scenarios. Generally, determining the optimal number of PCs depends on the quality of the damage patterns embedded in a data set, as well as the degree of noise exposure. As a general guideline, indications of dominant features of a data set are provided by individual and cumulative contributions from PCs. For example, if the first 7 PCs account for more than 99% of the information in the original data, selecting more than 7 PCs for damage identification is probably unnecessary as the information gained by including higher PCs is negligible."}, {"heading": "3.

Damage Identification through Neural Networks", "text": "The compressed FRF data is transmitted to their respective neural network to determine the location and the severity of the damage. the stiffened panel consists of 34 rivets. The binary vector of the size 34 \u00d7 1 characterizes the location of the rivet where the damage occurred. The verified vector with all \"0\" stands for a healthy structure. The learning algorithm for Bavarian regularization is used for the above neural network. The power diagrams for the neural network crack are captured in Figure 3. The tested power parameter is the mean square error, the best network.The numerical structure (Figure 4), which contains crack, is subject to a random charge time signal, the time response signal of 8 measuring points are transformed into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier transform method to obtain frequency response functions.The huge FRF data is compressed to the main FRF data compressed to the Vexx1 of the network."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "The proposed work dealt with artificial neural networks (ANNs) in vibration-based damage identification and their application in the aerospace industry.The proposed damage identification scheme is based on frequency response functions (FRFs).The method uses neural network techniques and main component analyses for damage trait extraction and reduction. In order to verify the proposed damage identification procedures, numerical studies were conducted on a stiffened panel structure.To overcome the obstacle of the large size of FRF data, the introduction of PCA techniques was proposed. Besides data reduction, PCA also offers the advantage of noise reduction and damage trait extraction, which further helps to reduce uncertainties from sources such as measuring noise and environmental fluctuation.The main component analysis proved to be an efficient technique for compressing the data without loss of information on damage traits to determine the damage traits performance based on the proposed FRF."}], "references": [{"title": "Damage identification and health monitoring of structural and mechanical systems from changes in their vibration characteristics: a literature review", "author": ["S.W.S.
