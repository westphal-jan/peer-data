CAT is used to build computer-aided and computer-aided tests; the computer system selects questions for a student to take the test and evaluates his / her performance; the process can be divided into two phases: modeling and testing. In the first phase, the student model is created, while in the second, the model is used to actually test the test subjects. There are many different model types [Almond and Mislevy, 1999, Culbertson, 2014, Cowell et al., 1999] that can be used for adaptive testing. In this paper, we will cover the Item Response Theory (IRT), which is a model that is regularly used for CAT, Bayesian and neural networks (BNs et al., 1999)."}, {"heading": "1.1 Advantages of CAT", "text": "Shorter tests: One of the most obvious advantages of CAT is that the overall length of a test is reduced. As questions are selected according to the level of the student being tested, he / she is not forced to answer questions that are too easy or too difficult. Fairness: A test in classical theory usually aims to determine the level of the student. This leads to a reduction in the length of the test in time and the number of questions. Normally, it is sufficient to ask only half of the questions in order to achieve reliable outcomes. Fairness: A test in classical theory normally expects a Gaussian point distribution in the student population. This expectation leads to frequencies of question answers to be of the same distribution (most questions are medium and less of them are easy)."}, {"heading": "1.2 Disadvantages of CAT", "text": "About the use of some elements: This problem strongly depends on the way we use to select the following questions for students. However, the most commonly used criteria run the risk that the same questions will be selected for student groups and / or the selection of certain questions in many tests. For example, if the selection process is not changed, the first question will be the same for each student. We do not yet have information about the student and the selection process leads to the same question. In addition, it is possible to change the selection process for student groups to ensure a wider distribution of selected questions via the questionnaire, as the number of possible answer combinations increases. This behavior can be reduced by having a large questionnaire with many different questions with similar characteristics (i.e. difficulty level). In addition, it is possible to modify the selection process to ensure a wider distribution of selected questions via the questionnaire (with reduced precision).Initial data collection: To obtain a full set of data from a large CAT it is necessary to use the initial data collection set."}, {"heading": "Data Collection", "text": "To support the creation of a student model, we gathered empirical data and designed an essay test for high school mathematical proficiency that focuses on simple functions (mainly polynomic, trigonometric and exponential / logarithmic).1 Students were asked to solve various mathematical problems, including drawing and reading diagrams, calculating points on the diagram, finding roots, describing functional shapes and other functional properties."}, {"heading": "2.1 Test Design", "text": "This version was done by a small group of students and took about 80 minutes to be solved. We evaluated this first version and based on this assessment we made before the main test cycle. It was necessary to limit the time of the test to 45 minutes to do one lesson. Some questions were completely removed from the test, mainly those where the informational advantage of the problem was too small due to their high or low difficulty (i.e. few students answered correctly or incorrectly). There was no assumption that all students should be able to complete all questions in the time that would create a school test."}, {"heading": "2.2 Test Assessment", "text": "In the following section, we make an exception to this rule: The first problem is very simple and is divided into 8 parts. It should be performed for each large scale test. It might not be necessary to perform all the measures shown below for CAT. Nevertheless, we will use these results to compare classic approaches and CAT results, as well as to point out some interesting correlations. Furthermore, it proves that the paper test we have used to provide reasonable results. True results and reliability The goal of each test is to measure a certain variable. This variable reflects the ability, ability or level of another quality (some psychiatric tests could measure the person's empathy). In terms of IRT and CAT, this variable is part of the student model described in Section 3.1. Even in the classic test, there is a certain variable. A test is just a tool created to measure this variable. As always, when something is measured, the measurement process is hampered by measuring errors."}, {"heading": "Validity", "text": "Another important question is whether the test actually measures the factor it is meant to measure (i.e. in our case, if the score obtained reflects mathematical skills rather than the ability to read the question or written skills of the test), a property called validity and there are many different ways to prove the validity of the test. Most validity evidence comes from outside the test. One way is to have the test respondent answer a new different test that measures the same factor (ideally a test that is already well established), and another way is to use other factors known about the test that have been performed in our case."}, {"heading": "2.3 Preliminary Test Statistics", "text": "In this section, we present an overview of the results of the tests, which should give an idea of the students \"abilities to prove validity, as mentioned in the paragraph above and later used for comparison.Table 2.2 shows the scores achieved divided by gender and school. We calculated peers\" correlation coefficients of the scores with other factors, the results are shown in Table 2.3. The correlation test is linked to its p-value, where the zero score is a correlation of 0 (not a correlation). It means that we can say that the correlation between the score and all grades (mathematics, physics and chemistry) exists; the negative value of the correlation means that a better grade (a lower score) yields a better score (a higher value) that is expected; in addition, we can see that the grade in mathematics has the highest correlation, while physics and chemistry have a lower correlation; another significant correlation is, interestingly, between the fact that the student has a score that indicates his / her name and a score."}, {"heading": "Models for Adaptive Testing", "text": "We recall, as mentioned in section 1, the process of an adaptive test. \u2022 The next question to be asked is selected. \u2022 This question is asked and an answer is obtained. \u2022 This answer is inserted into the model. \u2022 The model (which provides estimates of the student's abilities) is updated. \u2022 (optional) Answers to all questions are estimated taking into account the current estimates of the student's abilities. In this section we will take a closer look at the model structures for different approaches. Furthermore, we will discuss the question selection process from step 1 of the above list. Insertion into the model (step 3) and consequent updating of the model (steps 4 and 5) are always done with the appropriate tools for the respective model and are not discussed in detail here. This topic, especially for BNs, is discussed in [Plajner and Vomlel, 2015]. We conducted experiments with empirical data using different models of the following model types. The results of these experiments are not part of this paper, but they are available in [Plajner and Vomlel] in 2016."}, {"heading": "3.1 Building Models with the Help of IRT", "text": "The beginnings of Item Response Theory (IRT) date back about five decades [Lord and Novick, 1968, Rasch, 1960, Rasch, 1993]. This approach differs from classical test theory (CTT) and has received scientific attention ever since. IRT allows for a more accurate measurement of an individual's abilities. Internationally, there are a large number of tests that adapt this concept. There are stronger assumptions, but it also delivers stronger results. Nevertheless, its prevalence is not as high as expected. This lower influence could be caused by the fact that more statistical and theoretical preparation of a test creator is required than in practice."}, {"heading": "1 -2 0.3 0", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2 0 1.5 0", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3 5 0.7 0", "text": "In the Czech Republic, there are only a few large normalized tests that use this concept [Urba \u0301 nek et al., 2011] 1.IRT expects a student to have an ability (skill) that directly influences his / her chance of correctly answering a question. This ability is called latent ability or latent property \u03b8. If we have only one variable, it is customary to call it a variable of skill. We stick to the more general variable concept of skill, because we will have more variables in the following parts (Bayesian networks). Each question of the IRT model has an associated item response function (IRF), which represents a probability of a successful answer. There are more variants of the form of this IRF, but mostly a 3-parametric model (often referred to as 3PL) is used. These parameters convert a standardized logistic function. The resulting IRF, as the probability of a correct answer to i-ulth with probability, is represented by a certain parameter."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Adaptive Test Procedure", "text": "Building a CAT model with IRT is very straightforward. IRT itself, as described above, is prepared in the form to be used for CAT. Using the model compiled from sample data or compiled by domain experts, we have IRFs for each question. At each stage of the test, we can calculate an estimate of latent skill based on the answers x: p (\u03b8 | x). For these estimates, empirical bayes or methods of multiple imputation of IRT are used. In this section, we will only discuss models with latent variability.Of the latent skills, for example, we know the probabilities of a correct answer pi (Anton und Ruef, 2010] 2There are variants of the multidimensional IRT model where it is possible to have more than one latent variable, but in this section we will only discuss models with a latent variability.From the latent skills, we know that probabilities of a correct answer pi (and a faulty answer to each p is a question)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Building Models with the Help of BN", "text": "In this section, we will discuss the basic definitions of Bayesian networks, more details can be found in [Nielsen and Jensen, 2007, Kj\u00e6rulff and Madsen, 3With 3 parametric models, these two numbers do not necessarily yield 12008]. The use of BNs in educational assessment is discussed, for example, in [Vomlel, 2004b, Vomlel, 2004a]. The Bayesian network is a probable graphic model, a structure representing conditional independence statements. It consists of the following: \u2022 a series of variables (nodes), \u2022 a series of edges, \u2022 a series of conditional probabilities, \u2022 a series of conditional nodes, 2, 2, 2004a]. Edges between variables must be formed a directed acyclic graph (BAG). Each variable has a list of 2. Exclusive states. For each variable, a probability distribution table is defined: 1, B2, B2, B2, B2, B2, B2, B2, B2, B2, B2, B2, BAG."}, {"heading": "Types of Nodes", "text": "We will divide the nodes of a BN into three groups.4Note that the variables without parents have the table in the form P (A) \u2022 A set of n variables that we want to estimate {S1,..., Sn}. These variables represent a student's latent abilities (abilities, knowledge). We will call them skills or skill variables. We will use the symbol S to denote the multivariable S = (S1,.., Sn) that takes the states s = (s1,.., sn, in). \u2022 A set of m variables that represent any additional information about the student {I1,...., Im}. We will use the symbol I to denote the multivariable I = (I1,.., Im) by taking states i = (i1,..., im). \u2022 A set of p questions (mathematical problems) {X1,.,.,., Xp}."}, {"heading": "Skills", "text": "It means that they are hidden variables of the model and their value is not known before the model is created. Several decisions about skills concerning skill nodes are to be made during the creation of the model. The first decision is the number of skills themselves. Should we expect a common skill or should there rather be several different skills, each related to a subset of questions? In the later case it is necessary to determine which skills are involved in solving each particular question (i.e. a mathematical problem). These skills become parents of the question under consideration. Possible relationships between them are discussed in the last chapter. In this way, we create variables with a specific meaning (specific skill of the student). It is not possible to capture all the skills necessary to solve a question. Also, there are some other aspects that are important for solving a question. During the interpretation of a CAT result, we must be careful. Even if we have given the variable meaning, it is possible that the model learns a combination of these meanings with other factors if the model is constructed correctly."}, {"heading": "Information about a Student", "text": "Information nodes collect additional information that we have about a student. They are observed variables, and the number of their states corresponds to the possible options of the specific information. A state marked as \"unknown\" can also be included for missing values, especially if it has an information value in the test. For example, if a student does not enter his math grade, it may indicate that he does not feel very safe. If this is the case, this information can be used to our advantage. This additional information can improve the quality of the student model."}, {"heading": "Questions", "text": "The last type of nodes are question nodes. This type of node contains answers to individual questions. Its state space depends on the number of possible answers to a question. As already mentioned, it is difficult to build a computerized system to evaluate answers that do not use the multiple choice question type. In some cases, it is possible to have open answers to questions, but in most cases they would be too difficult to process. In multiple choice, a question node has two possible states: 1. One state for each possible answer, 2. One state for the correct answer and 1 for an incorrect answer. The first case is more informative. It allows us to distinguish between students not only because the answer is right / wrong, but also because it is wrong. However, it has some limitations. The more states the higher the number of model parameters to learn. With limited training data, it can be difficult to reliably estimate parameters."}, {"heading": "Connections between Nodes", "text": "The final step in creating the BN model is to define a set of arcs between variables (nodes), i.e. the network structure. This group defines relationships between skills, questions, and additional information, and ultimately between them. This task is usually done by hand by the domain expert. There are algorithms for automated structuring, but these algorithms are intended for general cases and usually do not provide useful results for this specific purpose. The connection can be from \u2022 a deterministic relationship in which we must assign all values to a related conditional probability table (which is discussed in the next section), or \u2022 a specific relationship, e.g. AND, OR, etc. (discussed in the last section). When we make connections between skills to define another skill, it may depend on two skills that we need to directly specify skills."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Model Learning", "text": "The last action to complete a BN is the definition of conditional probability tables (CPTs) for each node. Values in CPTs represent probabilities that the variable is in a state determined by a configuration of its parents for each state of the variable and each combination of its parents. First, we enter values manually into CPTs. Values should reflect a general expectation and are created with expert knowledge in the field of testing. These probabilities serve as the starting point for the learning algorithm. Next, we learn the model using the standard EM algorithm based on collected data. This operation modifies values in CPTs to better reflect the data. BNs have a great advantage as they can learn from missing data (with some unknown values). The EM algorithm used for learning has no problems with missing data. Also, unknown values are simply not inserted into the network during the prediction process and the prediction is carried out without this knowledge."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Adaptive Test Procedure", "text": "During the adaptive test, we use standard BN inference methods to update the network. These methods estimate the probabilities of skill variables as well as the probabilities of success in unanswered questions. A problem to be solved during the CAT procedure is the selection of the next question. It is repeated at each step of the test and is described below. Leave the test in the state of s \u2212 1 steps. It means that s questions have already been answered and they form the proof e: e = {Xi1 = xi1,.., Xin = xin | i1,.,. in which skills exist. Remaining QuestionsXs = X\\ eare ignored (unanswered). The aim is to select a question from Xs to be asked next. We select a question with the greatest expected information gain. We calculate the cumulative Shannon entropy of all skill variables given by S. It is given by the following formula: H (e)."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Obtaining Total Score from Skills", "text": "In some cases, this is more useful than a normal score. On the other hand, if we want to get a score in terms of points achieved, we need to transform these skills. First, we define a score SC as a weighted sum of skills (S1 = s1,.., Sn = sn): SC def = n \u2211 i = 1 siCiCi is a weight associated with the i-th skill. These weights define the maximum scoreSCmax = n \u2211 i = 1 si, niCi, where si, ni is the last possible state of Si. The weights Ci can be set to any value. There are two special cases. The first is when all weights are set to equalCi = C. Then the impact of each skill on the overall result depends on the number of skills. The second is if we want all skills to have the same effect on the score. Then weights must be set to Cii = nmax ni C, where nmax jalis = maximum value on the total skill being tested."}, {"heading": "3.3 Building Models with the Help of NN", "text": "There are three different parts of an NN: 1. an input layer, 2. several hidden layers, and 3. an output layer. Each layer consists of several nodes called neurons. These neurons have connections to the next layer. Normally, the connections from one neuron to all neurons in the next layer are formed. Each connection has an associated weight. These weights are used to calculate a value of a neuron from values of its predecessors. A major difference between NN and previously described IRT and BN models is that NNs are learned through supervised learning. In this scenario, an output (result) that must be predicted by a NN must be known during learning. IRT and BNs usually work with unattended learning."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Selecting the Next Question", "text": "In the two previous models, we used the entropy reduction criterion to select the next question. Entropy was measured using the qualification variables. We do not have qualification variables with NN, but only a score output. In this case, measuring entropy is not possible because reducing the entropy of the overall score would mean trying to get a student to a certain score value. With Score, there is no reason why we wanted a student to achieve a certain level of scaling with Skills. Instead, we propose a simple criterion to deal with selecting the next question. We want the selected question to provide us with as much information as possible about the student. This means that a student who answers incorrectly should be on the score scale of the one who answers correctly as far as possible. Let the SC | Xi, x be the score prediction after answering the i question."}, {"heading": "3.4 Some Remarks on Models", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Scoring", "text": "We need to perform transformations to the Score Scale if we want to create a score of the test. BN discussed this in Section 3.2.3. IRT models can use a similar procedure. NN models directly predict the resulting score, so no conversion is required."}, {"heading": "Question nodes", "text": "BN allows us to use any answer to a question as information about the student, which can help the adaptive test evolve more quickly if there are some answers that are more \"wrong\" than others. As mentioned above, large amounts of data are required to learn to avoid overfitting. Additional information BN and NN models allow us to include additional information about a student, which is not possible in the standard version of IRT-CAT."}, {"heading": "Future Work", "text": "In this section, we give a brief overview of research problems that continue to occupy us."}, {"heading": "Constrained question selection", "text": "Adaptive tests created with the IRT model have several established methods for selecting the next questions. As discussed in the first chapter, the selection process should be handled carefully to avoid overloading some questions as well as very similar question combinations for many participants. IRT researchers, for example, solve this problem through a number of limitations in the selection process [van der Linden and Veldkamp, 2004, Stocking and Lewis, 2000]. We plan to analyze the application of such limitations to BN models, and the research will be conducted to define the proper limitations, their application and their impact on the CAT process."}, {"heading": "Precision of skills measurement", "text": "There are two types of stop presets for CAT used in IRT: \u2022 Practical, e.g. limited test duration or a certain number of questions asked, or \u2022 Statistical, e.g. reliability of the test (accuracy of measured latent capabilities).The aim of this research path is to provide a similar criterion for BN-CAT models as well. We will establish a criterion that is able to provide a statistically correct estimate. Afterwards, we will review the impact of using this criterion as stop preset for CAT."}, {"heading": "Model quality criterion", "text": "This criterion provides reasonable results, but also has some disadvantages. Firstly, some models that are similar to each other are often difficult to classify qualitatively, the predictive accuracy varies over the course of the test, and the order of the models changes in different steps (different number of questions asked). Next, some models are able to predict the abilities of the student very well, while their predictive power based on answers is not as good. These models have a disadvantage compared to other models (with better backward accuracy) if we use the current criterion, especially some neural network models. We will focus on the design and test criteria that are able to take into account more aspects of the models for CAT. We would like to better describe and experimentally verify using data, criteria that work with competence estimates. Specifically, we will compare the quality of a model as a correlation of the predicted results with the real values and the final values on the basis of predictions."}, {"heading": "Model creation", "text": "One reason for the low prevalence of CAT use is the high amount of work involved in creating a student model. The process itself may be very useful due to its highly organized nature and statistically strong results, but it requires a certain amount of expertise in modelling and statistics. We want to look at the option of automated modelling based on data. Algorithms for learning BN structures generally exist, some examples are in [Margaritis, 2003]. These algorithms cover general structural learning, which may work well in some areas, but in the case of CAT generally does not reflect our situation very well. We want to explore specific types of models that would better suit our needs as a CAT model. This leads to learning a model that contains a local structure. It is an interesting theoretical task for the entire BN community, which is not limited to CAT alone."}, {"heading": "Local structure in BNs", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive themselves if they don't see themselves able to survive themselves.

We present three different methods for CAT. One of them, the item response theory, is a well established method, while the other two, Bayesian and neural networks, are new in the area of educational testing. In the first part of this paper, we present the concept of CAT and its advantages and disadvantages. We collected data from paper tests performed with grammar school students. We provide the summary of data used for our experiments in the second part. Next, we present three different model types for CAT. They are based on the item response theory, Bayesian networks, and neural networks. The general theory associated with each type is briefly explained and the utilization of these models for CAT is analyzed. Future research is outlined in the concluding part of the paper. It shows many interesting research paths that are important not only for CAT but also for other areas of artificial intelligence.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
