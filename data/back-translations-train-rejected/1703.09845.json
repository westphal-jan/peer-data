INTRODUCTION", "text": "Most job seekers have a salary (or remuneration) of crucial importance in choosing a new job.

PROBLEM SETTING", "text": "In the publicly launched LinkedIn Salary Product [25], users can explore compensation insights by searching for different titles and locations (Figure 1), and for a specific title and location, we present the quantities (10th and 90th percentiles, median) and histograms for base salary, bonus, and other types of compensation, as well as more detailed insights into how compensation is based on factors such as location, experience, education, company size, and industry, and which locations, industries, or companies pay the most. Insights into compensation presented in the product are based on anonymized compensation data collected from LinkedIn users. We have designed a model-based collection process based on the following: Initially, cohorts (such as San Francisco Bay Area User Experience Designers) are selected with a sufficient number of LinkedIn users, and within each cohort, emails are sent to a random subset of users who are invited to submit their remuneration data later in the year."}, {"heading": "2.1 Modeling Challenges", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want."}, {"heading": "3. LINKEDIN SALARY MODELING SYSTEM DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE", "text": "We describe the overall design and architecture of the salary model system used in the recently launched LinkedIn Salary Product. Our system consists of an online component that uses a service-oriented architecture to retrieve remuneration knowledge that corresponds to the user's request, and an offline component to process anonymized remuneration data and generate remuneration insight. Figure 2 represents the key components of our system, which are divided into three groups: Online, Run Regular and Run As Needed. Explanations of the text in the figure are illustrated in italics throughout the rest of the section."}, {"heading": "3.1 Online System for Retrieving", "text": "Remuneration Insights3.1.1 LinkedIn Salary PlatformThe REST Server provides remuneration insights upon request from REST Client. The REST API [18] enables retrieval of individual insights or their lists. For each cohort, one insight, when data is available, includes quantities (10th and 90th percentiles) and histograms for base salary, bonus and other remuneration types. For robustness of insights into the number of submissions and changes we collect, we report quantities such as 10 and 90th percentiles and median, rather than absolute range and significance."}, {"heading": "3.2 Offline System for Computing", "text": "The insights are generated by an offline workflow that consumes the anonymized submission data (equivalent to cohorts that have at least a minimum number of entries) and then pushes the results into the Insights and Lists Voldemort key value stores [26]. The analytical data is generated in multiple places for business analysis, research, development, debugging, and testing. We can also use the previously generated compensation data to verify data quality by checking differences in the size or number of cohorts, or in their insights.This offline workflow consists of two groups that run regularly for the hadoop flow, which runs more than once a day, and Run As Needefor Hadoop and other flows that run, for example, when external data is modified."}, {"heading": "4.

The lower the threshold for the number of samples, the higher the likelihood that the product will have good coverage of the findings for many different cohorts, the more accurate the empirical estimates of the insights (e.g. that a cohort contains very little data) are for cohorts with very few user-entry samples that prove to be a key challenge. Due to the scarcity of data, empirical estimates of the 10th or 90th percentiles, or even media distribution, we are not reliable if a cohort contains very little data. Empirical estimates of the 10th percentiles of a cohort with only 10 points are the minimum of the 10 points known as a very imprecise estimate."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "Next, we will present an evaluation of our LinkedIn Salary Compensation Insight calculation system, focusing on statistical models, examining the impact of outlier detection methods, evaluating the effectiveness of the regression model and Bayesian statistical smoothing, and evaluating the performance of statistical smoothing techniques across segments and under different parameter settings."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "As previously described, we have implemented our statistical models as part of the offline compensation calculation system and used them in production as part of the LinkedIn salary product. Our offline compensation calculation system is in a distributed computing environment with Hadoop. We conducted our experiments over nearly a year of anonymized compensation data collected from more than one million LinkedIn users in three countries (the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom). Due to privacy requirements, we only have access to data at the cohort level that includes anonymized compensation submissions (e.g. salaries for software engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area), limited to cohorts with at least a minimum number of entries. Each cohort consists of a set of anonymized compensation data that correspond to the individual, and each individual entry consists of values for different types of compensation. There are approximately 54K challenging country regions, and title models of these regions are strictly available to us because we have the BLLA cohorts, which are very hard to identify."}, {"heading": "5.2 Studying Impact of Spurious Added Data", "text": "The reason for this is the fact that the people mentioned are people who are able to outdo themselves, and that they are able to outdo themselves, and that they are able to outdo themselves, and that they are able to outdo themselves, and that they are able to outdo themselves."}, {"heading": "5.3 Evaluating Regression Model and Bayesian Statistical Smoothing", "text": "We are dealing with a very complex system, in which the question is whether and to what extent people in the individual countries are able to survive themselves.

LESSONS LEARNED IN PRACTICE", "text": "Next, we present the challenges we have encountered and the lessons we have learned from the production deployment of our two pay models for offline workflow and REST service as part of the general LinkedIn salary system for more than a year, first during salary collection and later as part of the publicly launched product. We have conducted several iterative deployments of the offline workflow and REST service, always maintaining a sandbox version (for testing) and a production version of our system; the service has been distributed to multiple servers in different data centers to ensure better error tolerance and latency; one of the biggest challenges has been the lack of good public \"ground truths\" data sets. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service has fairly complete salary data, but it is not public. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides aggregated data, but that brings the challenge of bridging LinkedIn taxonomy. Some states, for example, California, provide government salaries, but government jobs differ."}, {"heading": "7. RELATED WORK", "text": "Salary information products: There are several commercial services that offer compensation information. For example, Glassdoor [6] offers a comparable service, while PayScale [8] collects individual salary submissions, provides free reports for detailed matches, and sells compensation information to corporations. However, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics [7] soon publishes a variety of pay and benefit statistics. Privacy: Maintaining users \"privacy is critical in collecting compensation data. Initially, we wanted to use strict privacy practices such as differentiated privacy [14, 15]. However, we soon realized that these are not applicable in our context for the following reasons: (1) the amount of noise added to the quantities, histograms, and other insights (thereby depriving remuneration insights of their reliability and usefulness), as the worst-case sensitivity of these features to each user's remuneration data is applicable."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We explored the problem of calculating robust, reliable compensation insights based on anonymized compensation data collected from LinkedIn users. We introduced the design and architecture of the modeling system underlying LinkedIn's salary product, which was recently launched to increase transparency and help professionals make more informed career decisions. We highlighted unique challenges, such as modeling anonymized data, the lack of good evaluation data or policies and the simultaneous need for user privacy, data quality and product coverage, and described how we address them through mechanisms such as outlier detection and Bayesian hierarchical smoothing. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our models by conducting extensive experiments with anonymized data from over a million users. We also discussed design decisions and goal conflicts during the build of our system and the lessons learned from more than a year of production delivery to better understand the availability of data (combining the multiple data allowances with research opportunities)."}, {"heading": "9.
