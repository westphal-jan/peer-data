The dialect identification challenging task becomes more complicated when dealing with an under-resourced dialects belonging to a same county/region. In this paper, we start by analyzing statistically Algerian dialects in order to capture their specificities related to prosody information which are extracted at utterance level after a coarse-grained consonant/vowel segmentation. According to these analysis findings, we propose a Hierarchical classification approach for spoken Arabic algerian Dialect IDentification (HADID). It takes advantage from the fact that dialects have an inherent property of naturally structured into hierarchy. Within HADID, a top-down hierarchical classification is applied, in which we use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) method to build a local classifier for every parent node into the hierarchy dialect structure. Our framework is implemented and evaluated on Algerian Arabic dialects corpus. Whereas, the hierarchy dialect structure is deduced from historic and linguistic knowledges. The results reveal that within {\\HD}, the best classifier is DNNs compared to Support Vector Machine. In addition, compared with a baseline Flat classification system, our HADID gives an improvement of 63.5% in term of precision. Furthermore, overall results evidence the suitability of our prosody-based HADID for speaker independent dialect identification while requiring less than 6s test utterances.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 14:26:13 GMT  (178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10065v1", "33 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "33 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["soumia bougrine", "hadda cherroun", "djelloul ziadi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10065"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.10065.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Hierarchical Classification for Spoken Arabic Dialect Identification using Prosody: Case of Algerian Dialects", "authors": ["Soumia Bougrinea", "Hadda Cherrouna", "Djelloul Ziadib"], "emails": ["sm.bougrine@lagh-univ.dz", "hadda_cherroun@mail.lagh-univ.dz", "djelloul.ziadi@univ-rouen.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In day-to-day communication, Arabs use local dialects that are difficult to automatically identify with traditional classification methods, and the difficult task of dialect recognition becomes more complicated when dealing with inadequately equipped dialects that belong to a circle / region.

A Glance at Algerian Arabic Dialects", "text": "It is a large country with a total area of about 2.4 million square kilometers, divided into 48 departments, Algeria borders mainly three Arab countries, Tunisia to the northeast, Libya to the east, Morocco to the west. Algeria's official language is MSA, as in all Arab countries, but Algeria's local dialects are mainly used by the Arab dialects spoken as dialects in Algeria. Algerian dialects present themselves as complex linguistic features, which mainly indicate the appropriation of the Arabic language by the Berber peoples and the deep colonization. In fact, the Algerian Arabic dialect is affected by other languages such as Turkish, French, Italian and Spanish."}, {"heading": "4. Prosodic Information for Dialects", "text": "To identify a language / dialect, many features and metrics in the literature are developed to capture the prosody inherent in a language. In this section, we first outline our motivation behind using prosody for ADID. Then, we describe some prosodic features related to the purpose of DID. Finally, we explain how we extracted them."}, {"heading": "4.1. Why Prosody for Arabic Dialect Identification?", "text": "The knowledge we have today about the discriminatory power of prosody in Arabic dialects, and especially in Algerian dialects, can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Arabic dialects differ in their prosodic structure: Barkat et al. [41] assessed the discriminatory power of prosodic patterns in Arabic dialects in a linguistic study. They showed that the prosodic information can be sufficient to identify Western and Eastern Arabic dialects. \u2022 Arabic dialects exhibit significant differences in syllable structure: Hamdiet al. [42] showed that the different types of syllable structure observed in Arabic dialects can be used as a discriminatory element. \u2022 They showed that the rhythmic variation of Arabic dialects is correlated to the syllable structure. Furthermore, Bouziri et al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al [43] confirmed this fact by measuring the stress of the syllable structure. \u2022 The intonation of Arabic dialects distinguishes between five distinct features observed in Arabic dialects:"}, {"heading": "4.2. Prosodic Features", "text": "In order to gather prosodic information, pitch and duration of pitch VI are used to determine intonation and rhythm. Rhythm refers to aspects of the temporal organization of speech. To capture quantitative rhythmic variation, various rhythm measurements have been developed to measure the vocal and consonant intervals in continuous speech. The first and most popular measurement for classifying a language includes: Interval variables (IM) [47], its normalized version (VarcoV / VarcoC) [48], and the pairwise variability index (PVI) [49]. In addition, we consider another measurement: Speech rate, which measures the number of syllables per second. IM measurements include three separate measurements: the duration ratio, the standard deviation of the vocal interval (% V, \u0445V), and the standard deviation of the consonant interval (ST)."}, {"heading": "4.3. Segmentation and Features Extraction", "text": "The extraction of the prosodic characteristics requires a consonant / vowel segmentation. To solve this problem, we rely on the specific Arabic syllable structure to perform a consonant / vowel segment, as we explain below: A syllable is the unit of pronunciation between a phoneme and a word. It is divided into three components: the opening sentence, the central nucleus, and the concluding segment 300Coda. The nucleus and the coda are called rhyme (or r\u00e9me). In Arabic dialect, each syllable contains at least one nucleus, while coda and onset are optional; the nucleus is one or many vowels imperative, and the others are consonants."}, {"heading": "5. Prosodic Statistic Analysis of Algerian Dialects", "text": "In this section, we will first examine whether Algerian-Arabic dialects can be distinguished on the basis of prosodic information, and then discuss what types of prosodic information can support the identification of the Algerian-Arabic dialect."}, {"heading": "5.1. Speech Material", "text": "It is important to note that there is no standard corpus for Algerian-Arabic dialects, as there is for some other Arab countries. [51] For this reason, we have compiled our own corpus ALG-DARIDJAH [25], which offers a representation of phonetic, prosodic and orthographic varieties of Algerian-Arabic dialects. Its current version contains five Arabic-Algerian dialects: Pre-Hila-l\u0131, Hila-l\u0131, Sulaymite, Ma'qilian and Urban Completely Bedouine dialects. Table 2 provides more details on the sample selected for the current analysis. The total number of utterances is 1892, each lasting about 6 years on average.

local dialects which are hard to identify automatically using conventional classification methods. The dialect identification challenging task becomes more complicated when dealing with an under-resourced dialects belonging to a same county/region. In this paper, we start by analyzing statistically Algerian dialects in order to capture their specificities related to prosody information which are extracted at utterance level after a coarse-grained consonant/vowel segmentation. According to these analysis findings, we propose a Hierarchical classification approach for spoken Arabic algerian Dialect IDentification (HADID). It takes advantage from the fact that dialects have an inherent property of naturally structured into hierarchy. Within HADID, a top-down hierarchical classification is applied, in which we use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) method to build a local classifier for every parent node into the hierarchy dialect structure. Our framework is implemented and evaluated on Algerian Arabic dialects corpus. Whereas, the hierarchy dialect structure is deduced from historic and linguistic knowledges. The results reveal that within HADID, the best classifier is DNNs compared to Support Vector Machine. In addition, compared with a baseline Flat classification system, our HADID gives an improvement of 63.5% in term of precision. Furthermore, overall results evidence the suitability of our prosody-based HADID for speaker independent dialect identification while requiring less than 6s test utterances.
