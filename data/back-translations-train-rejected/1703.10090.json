Several factors contributing to this have been identified, notably difficult access to data, limited collaboration between researchers from different groups, and little biological sharing."}, {"heading": "2 Sensitivity of data and privacy", "text": "This year it has come to the point where it will be able to put itself at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said."}, {"heading": "2.1 Protecting the individual", "text": "In fact, you will be able to put yourself in a situation where you put yourself in the centre, in which you put yourself in the centre."}, {"heading": "3 Social impact and biases", "text": "The question, therefore, is what are the most important clinical biases and how to overcome them, not only from ethical but also from legal responsibility. Regarding the issue of bias, which we have referred to in this section as algorithm transparency (Goodman, 2016; Kamarinou et al., 2016), this right to explanation requires that influences of bias be presented in training data. In addition to this bias, which we have introduced in Section 2, we will discuss other sources of bias in this section. Unlike bias, which is a bias at the corpus level, these biases are already present in documents here, and therefore difficult to take into account by introducing larger companies.Data quality text produced in clinical settings does not always tell a complete or accurate patient history (e.g. due to time constraints or the treatment of patients in different hospitals, decisions)."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "Difficult access to data due to privacy concerns has been an obstacle to progress in this area. We have discussed how the protection of privacy through remediation measures and the requirement for informed consent can impact work in this area. Perhaps it is time to rethink the right to privacy in the health sector in the light of recent work on the ethics of big data, particularly its uneasy relationship with the right to science, i.e. the ability to benefit from and participate in science (Tasioulas, 2016; Verbeek, 2014). We have also addressed possible sources of bias that may have implications for the application of NLP in the health sector and that may ultimately lead to unfair or harmful treatment."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Madhumita and the anonymous reviewers for their useful comments.
