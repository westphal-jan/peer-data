The key contribution of this paper is to formulate the task as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem, with each arm representing a model of the deformable object. To \"pull\" an arm and evaluate its utility, we use the arm's model to generate a velocity command for the gripper(s) holding the object and execute it. As the task proceeds and the object deforms, the utility of each model can change. Our framework estimates these changes and balances exploration of the model set with exploitation of high-utility models. We also propose an approach based on Kalman Filtering for Non-stationary Multi-armed Normal Bandits (KF-MANB) to leverage the coupling between models to learn more from each arm pull. We demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on synthetic trials, and performs competitively on several manipulation tasks in simulation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 22:15:46 GMT  (768kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10254v1", "Presented at the Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics, 2016, San Francisco, CA"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at the Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics, 2016, San Francisco, CA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["dale mcconachie", "dmitry berenson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10254"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.10254.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Dmitry Berenson"], "emails": ["dmcconac@umich.edu,", "berenson@eecs.umich.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 3.10 254v 1 [cs.R O] 29 Mar 2"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "One of the most important challenges in terms of the deformability of objects is the difficulty of modeling and simulating them.

(It may be that no model in the set produces the optimal option, but this does not prevent a model from being useful. In particular, the benefit of a model may change from one task to another and from one configuration to another, as the deformable object changes shape and moves in and out of contact with the environment. We start by defining the benefit around (t) by considering the space of a model as the expected improvement of the task error when the model m is used to generate a robot command in due time. If we know which model has the greatest benefit, we can resolve (4). This leads to a classic exploration-exploitation compromise where we have to explore the space of models in order to learn which is most useful, while at the same time exploiting the knowledge we have gained to define the framework that is already a multiarm (the multiarm)."}, {"heading": "5 MAB Formulation for Deformable Object Manipulation", "text": "Algorithm 1 MainLoop (O, \u03b2, \u03bb) 1: t \u2190 0 2: D \u2190 GeodesicDistanceMatrix (Prelaxed) 3: M \u2190 InitializeModels (D) 4: InitialzeBanditAlgorithm () 5: P (0) \u2190 SensePoints () 6: q (0) \u2190 SenseRobotConfig () 7: while true do 8: m \u2190 SelectArmUsingBanditAlgorithm () 9: T () GetTargets () 10: P (), We, P (s) ErrorCorrection (P (t), T) 11: P (s), Ws (StretchingCorrection (D, \u03bb, P (t) 12: P (D), Wd (CombineTerms (P), We, P (s), Ws) ErrorCorrection (P (P (t), T) 11: P (s), Ws)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Algorithms for MAB", "text": "We have tested three algorithms in our experiments, and our extension of KF-MANB, Kalman Filter Based Solution to Non-Stationary Normal Dependent Bandit (KF-MANDB), and our extension of KF-MANB, Kalman Filter Based Solution to Non-Stationary Multi-Arm Dependent Bandit (KF-MANDB).UCB1-Normal Algorithm [16] treats each arm (model) as independent, estimating an optimistic Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) for the utility of each model."}, {"heading": "5.3 Jacobian Models", "text": "This paper focuses on Jacobian-based models whose basic formulation Eq.

We have also presented Kalman Filtering for Non-stationary Multi-arm Normal Dependent Bandits (KF-MANDB) to use the coupling between dependent bandits to learn more from each arm pull. Our experiments show how to successfully perform several interesting tasks for rope and cloth with our method. One remarkable result we observe is that finding and exploiting the best model is less important than avoiding bad models over long periods of time. In all experiments, UCB1-Normal never leaves its initial exploration phase, but it is able to successfully perform each task. We believe this is due to the fact that many models are able to provide commands that point a positive product with correct direction of motion."}, {"heading": "8 Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partially supported by NSF grants IIS-1656101 and IIS-1551219.

present a novel approach to deformable object manipulation that does not rely on highly-accurate modeling. The key contribution of this paper is to formulate the task as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem, with each arm representing a model of the deformable object. To \u201cpull\u201d an arm and evaluate its utility, we use the arm\u2019s model to generate a velocity command for the gripper(s) holding the object and execute it. As the task proceeds and the object deforms, the utility of each model can change. Our framework estimates these changes and balances exploration of the model set with exploitation of high-utility models. We also propose an approach based on Kalman Filtering for Non-stationary Multi-armed Normal Bandits (KF-MANB) to leverage the coupling between models to learn more from each arm pull. We demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on synthetic trials, and performs competitively on several manipulation tasks in simulation.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
