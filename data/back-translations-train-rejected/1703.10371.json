PROGRESS ON EVOLVING ARTIFICIAL PLASTIC NEURAL NETWORKS", "text": "A common focus is the use of evolution to search for emerging mechanisms of adaptation, and other dynamic aspects of the evolutionary process. It is hoped that the goals will not only serve to achieve high-quality solutions, but primarily serve to examine the search path, evolutionary steps, characteristics of final solutions, and other dynamic aspects of the evolutionary process. It is hoped that subsymbolic and minimal algorithms will emerge from a combination of the right building blocks and starting conditions. Within this general idea of finding emerging mechanisms of learning and adaptation, certain areas of focus, reviewed in the next sections, may have contributed to progress with EPANNs.EPANN. EPANN setups can be seen as an interaction of simulated evolution and intelligent test environments in which the various inspiring principles are used to visualize learning dynamics."}, {"heading": "IV.

CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper first describes the far-reaching inspirations and aspirations of evolved plastic neural networks (EPANNs), which have been shown to come from large, diverse and interdisciplinary fields, and also reveals the ambitious and long-term research objectives of EPANNs with important implications for artificial intelligence and biology. EPANNs have made significant progress over the last two decades, leading to the discovery of a number of other research topics, such as the development of evolutionary algorithms to promote the evolution of learning, a better understanding of the complex interaction dynamics between evolution and learning, the benefits of multi-signal networks such as modulatory networks, and the attempt to develop architectures and appropriate representations of learning mechanism.Finally, the paper outlines that recent scientific and technological advances could allow for a gradual change in the potential of EPANNs. In light of current advances, a crucial moment for EPANNs to be discovered as the next tool in the field of artificial intelligence to be available in flexible algorithms."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Biological neural networks are systems of extraordinary computational capabilities shaped by evolution, development, and lifetime learning.
