MODELING FUZZY GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTORS", "text": "Our approach to this task consists of two main elements: a survey that gathers geographical data on users \"descriptors (details are explained in paragraph II-A) and a method that builds up its corresponding blurred definitions (the methodology is described in paragraph II-B. As in any D2T system, the method we have followed corresponds to a task to acquire knowledge. This task is designed to capture the fuzziness that arises for given linguistic terms (geographical descriptors in our case) from different interpretations of different users. Although the methodology and our specific approach to modelling blurred geographical descriptors are intended to be general and domain-independent, to support this research we are following a realistic use case. Specifically, our use case focuses on some of the most common geographical descriptors used, for example, in the RoadSafe system [2], [3] descriptors are automatically based on the geographical context of the user in a particular region."}, {"heading": "A. Description of the survey", "text": "The survey was designed with the lessons learned from the preliminary experiment described in [13] in mind. As a result, the survey was prepared to be very intuitive and short, without requiring excessive effort from the participants. In a design within the subjects, the participants were given 2 different geographical descriptors and asked to draw polygons in a map that represented their own interpretation of each descriptor.1) Materials: A single map was created for the Galician region of Spain, including only the geopolitical data that appear in the source map provided by Mapbox [16] and further adapted to show only the political boundaries of the region, a few place names and the height of the terrain. We included 2 descriptors in the survey. Specifically, in this survey, we integrated two geographical descriptors that were also considered, namely both the northern and southern cardinal directorates."}, {"heading": "B.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have presented an approach that addresses the problem of defining blurred geographical descriptors that aggregate the interpretation of different users, as part of the broader problem of generating geographical reference expressions. To this end, we have conducted a survey that collects data on the geographical interpretation that users of geographical descriptors such as \"north\" and \"south\" undertake in the context of the Galicia region of Spain. Based on this data set, we have proposed a method that builds blurred models of geographical descriptors. As a future work, we intend to conduct the survey described here to collect the interpretation of experienced weather forecasters, which will allow us to obtain deeper insights into the differences between the two subject groups and to examine the possibility of merging them into a single model. We will also examine other alternatives for building the blurred geographical descriptors, such as the paradigm of the actual geographical expressions we will continue to use [22] in order to define the actual geographical concepts [22]."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was financed by the projects TIN2014-56633-C3-1-R and TIN2014-56633-C3-3-R of the Spanish \"Ministerio de Econom\u0131'a y Competitividad\" (Accreditation 2016-2019, ED431G / 08) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)."}], "references": [{"title": "Choosing words in computer-generated weather forecasts", "author": ["E.
