Although neural networks have been successful in computer vision and natural language processing, they have not been so useful in equity trading. To demonstrate the applicability of a neural network in equity trading, we have developed a single-layer neural network that recommends buying or selling shares in a stock by comparing the peak of 10 consecutive days with that of the next 10 days - a process that repeats itself for years of historical data on the stock."}, {"heading": "1 Intro", "text": "Large companies (e.g. Google, Exxon Mobil, etc.) are not owned by a single person or a private group of individuals. Rather, these companies are divided into small pieces (shares) that are then sold to anyone who can afford them. The value of a single share depends on many factors, primarily their current and expected future profits. For example, a share in Apple (the largest company by aggregate share value) is sold at about $140. [1] When a company grows, its shares rise in value; Amazon shares were sold for $18 each in 1997 [2], but are now worth more than $800 because of Amazon's massive growth since [3]. A company's shares are called its \"shares.\" Stock investors try to buy shares in companies that will grow dramatically; an investor who bought shares in Amazon in 1997 would now be very rich. Many artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are applied to stock trading, such as genetic algorithms and a probable logical network [4] neural networks that simulates the brain."}, {"heading": "2 Methods & Procedure", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Experimental Trial", "text": "The neural network was created in Python 2.7 using Numpy, but a similar design in another language or using other tools is likely to produce similar results. Yahoo Finance is expected to have downloaded the daily highs last year from stocks in the Standard & Poors 500 (S & P 500), which were then grouped into n blocks, each for 10 days. The neural network takes a chunk as 10-vector input. It has only one hidden layer, which has 20 neurons. There is a 2-vector of the form (a, b) off. a and b are both recommendations in the interval [0, 1] with 1 being a strong recommendation. a recommends selling shares and b recommends buying shares. The recommendation with the larger size is used. For simplicity, the output of the network (a, b) can be used to generate a boolean c corresponding the index of the larger component."}, {"heading": "2.2 Control Trial", "text": "To know whether the neural network is useful, a random recommendation to buy or sell was applied to the S & P 500 data: it generated a cn \u2212 1 that was as likely to be 0 or 1. yn \u2212 1 = max (xn) > max (nn \u2212 1) as in the experimental group, and then recorded the accuracy of this decision (i.e. cn \u2212 1 = yn \u2212 1)."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "The null hypothesis argues that the neural network knows nothing about the stocks on which it makes decisions, and is therefore no better than a random proposal to either buy or sell. Of the 500 shares given to the control, 278 were decided correctly and 222 wrongly. Suppose that the control results are not statistically significant. If so, a chi-square analysis should show that the control is not statistically significant. If the standard formula is applied, there are 2 degrees of freedom. If a significance level \u03b1 = 0.01 with a single degree of freedom is assumed, a significance level \u03b1 = 0.01 > 6.63 would be required, which is not the case for the control group. In the experimental study, the neural network was given 385 shares \u2212 \u2212. If the null hypothesis is true, 192.5 decisions would be required, 192.5 and 192.5 wrong decisions for the remaining shares (7528.2)."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions & Discussion", "text": "The neural network has shown that it accurately predicts whether the highest value of a stock for 10 consecutive days is higher than the highest value of that stock for the next 10 days. However, this is not particularly applicable to real stock trading, since the network does not determine what the next high is, so the stock trader does not know when to buy or sell stock, but only that he or she should sometime do so. Changes in the configurations of the neural network, such as its dimensions and learning rate, can improve the accuracy of the neural network. Improvements can also be found through an alternative design, such as a neural network for conversion or a significant change to the existing network, such as a deep neural network."}, {"heading": "5 Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors thank hackNYU for providing food, beverages, lodging, Internet access and countless other tools during the development of the neural network, Yahoo for freely distributing inventory data, and Rufus Pollock for distributing a list of S & P 500 companies."}], "references": [{"title": "The Rise of the Artificially Intelligent Hedge Fund.
