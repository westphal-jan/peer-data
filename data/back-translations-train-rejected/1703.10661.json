There are more than 200 million native Bangla speakers. It is the official language of Bangladesh and several Indian states, including West Bengal, Tripura, Assam and Jharkhand. Bangla is also the official language of Sierra Leone, a West African country. With the rapid adoption of technology in various sectors in these regions, recognizing handwritten Bangla characters is an important challenge to overcome. While there have been great successes in applying machine learning tools to the English language, the same level of effectiveness is not observed for Bangla. One of the many reasons for this is the lack of a single comprehensive dataset covering the commonly used Bangla characters. There are existing datasets that either cover only the Bangla numbers or only the Bangla characters, or only the Bangla characters, or only the Bangla compound character teachings. While it is possible for researchers to combine the data set, it is incoherent to form a coherent dataset."}, {"heading": "2 Data Collection and Pre-processing", "text": "This data set was collected by educated native Bangla speakers from different regions and ages 4 to 27. A small fraction of the samples were collected from persons with physical disabilities, each person was given a form similar to the one shown in Figure 2. For a broader distribution of handwriting quality, certain time restrictions (10 minutes, 5 minutes, 2 minutes) were collected, and each person provided information about his / her age, gender, and district in which he / she lives. Images present in the data set were pre-processed in the following ways: \u2022 Foreground and background were inverted so that the images have a black background with the white letters. \u2022 Noise removal was attempted using the median filter. \u2022 An edge compression filter was applied. \u2022 The images were reduced in size to square and provided with appropriate padding to maintain the aspect ratio of the character drawn."}, {"heading": "3 Possible Uses of BanglaLekha-Isolated Dataset", "text": "Our data set can be used for handwritten character recognition, which is obvious, but there are some other features that can be used with our data set for research purposes. As mentioned in Section 1, it is possible to work on automatic detection of certain features of the writer such as age, gender, location, etc. This information can even be used for forensic purposes."}, {"heading": "4 Naming Convention", "text": "Each sample of the BangLekha Isolated dataset has a unique form ID, which can be used to identify the age, gender, district and institute of the participants. Thus, a 22-character form ID was proposed, with the first two digits representing the district, then the next four digits representing the institution, the next digit representing the gender and the next two digits representing the age, again the next four digits representing the date and the last four digits representing the form serial number and each information (digit part) being separated by an underscore. For example, 01 0001 0 09 1016 0001 is a unique form ID and here 01 means that the participant is the form serial number, 0001 means that the participant comes from the Ispahani School and College, then 0 means that the participant is male and 1016 means that the participant filled out the form in October 2016 and 0001 is the form serial number. Whenever one uses any character from this data set (such as 68,000), the data can be used."}, {"heading": "5 Marking", "text": "All 2000 forms collected were identified by 3 native Bangla speakers according to criteria established by a handwriting specialist. Marks are assessed on the basis of: \u2022 shape of characters \u2022 clarity of the image \u2022 appropriate use of the matra (a horizontal straight line placed over the consonants and some vowels of the Bengal alphabet) \u2022 subjective assessment based on the beauty of the letters The marks are also provided with the data set in a separate table."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Bangladesh Lekha-Isolated Dataset aims to create new opportunities for researchers interested in working on handwritten characters from Bangla. The dataset is available at [3]. This report documents the initial publication of the dataset. If further refinements are made and / or new datasets are collected, this report will be updated as appropriate."}], "references": [{"title": "Handwritten numeral databases of indian scripts and multistage recognition of mixed numerals,", "author": ["U.
