It has been generally observed that traditional NLP techniques pose a greater challenge than monolingual data in the processing of code mix data due to a variety of factors (Solorio and Liu, 2008b; Vyas et al., 2014; C-etinog, lu et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "2 Parsing Strategies", "text": "These strategies differ in the way they use existing treebanks to parse code-mixed data. \u2022 Monolingual: However, the monolingual method is disconnected from the respective monolingual method, which is based on the respective monolingual treebanks of the languages present in the code-mixed data. We can use the monolingual parser models in two different ways. First, we can analyze each code-mixed sentence by intelligently selecting the monolingual model based on the matrix language of the sentence. 2 A clear disadvantage of this method is that the monolingual parser cannot precisely parse these language models, the fragments of a sentence belonging to a language unknown to the model. Therefore, we consider this to be the basic method. Secondly, we can equalize the predictions of both monolingual models at the intersection time."}, {"heading": "3 Code-mixed Dependency Annotations", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, there is no available code-mixed dataset that contains dependency annotations, but there are some available code-mixed datasets that contain annotations on the language of a token, its POS, and chunk tags. To intrinsically evaluate our analytical models on code-mixed texts, we manually commented on a dataset of code-mixed tweets with dependency structures. Code-mixed tweets were evaluated from a large number of tweets from Indian users that we crawled with Tweepy3-a Twitter API wrappers from Twitter. We used a language identification system (see \u00a7 4) to filter Hindi-English code-mixed tweets from the crawled Twitter data. Only3http: / www.tweepy.org / these tweets were selected that met a minimum ratio of 30: 70 (%) code mixes."}, {"heading": "4 Preprocessing", "text": "The parsing strategies we discussed above for code-mixed texts rely heavily on the language identification of individual tokens, and we also need the normalization of non-standard word forms that predominate in code mix social media content and back transcriptions of Romanized Hindi words. Here, we discuss both preprocessing steps in short form. We model language identification as a classification problem in which each token must be placed in one of the following categories: \"Hindi,\" \"acronym\" (s), \"Named Entity\" (ne), and \"Universal\" (univ). For this task, we use the feedforward neural network architecture of Bhat et al. (2016) 4 proposed words in code-mixed-data-mixed-data-data-data-data of Indian languages. We train the network with similar feature representations on the task shared in ICON 20155."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Setup", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments and Results", "text": "We conducted several experiments to measure the effectiveness of the proposed parsing strategies both in gold and in predicted settings. In predicted settings, we used the monolingual POS marker for all experiments. We used the monolingual method as a starting point for evaluating other parsing strategies. The baseline model analyzes each sentence in the assessment sentences using either Hindi or English parsing model based on the matrix language of the sentence. For the baseline and multipass methods, we use bilingual embedding space derived from the matrix language to represent lexical nodes in the input layer of our parsing architecture. In the interpolation method, we use separate monolingual embedding spaces for each model. The interpolation weights are matched using the development set and the best results are obtained on the basis."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we evaluated various strategies for parsing code-mixed data that use only monolingual annotated data. We have shown that code-mixed texts can be efficiently analyzed by the monolingual parsing models if intelligently manipulated. As opposed to an informed monolingual baseline, our parsing strategies are at least 10 LAS points better. Among the different strategies we have proposed, multilingual and interpolation methods are two competitive methods for parsing code-mixed data.
