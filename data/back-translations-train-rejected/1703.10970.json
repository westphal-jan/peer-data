The model goes beyond existing accounts in that (i) it suggests a cognitive process through which social influence plays out in these markets (ii) it is bolstered by a rich utility framework and is thus amenable to welfare analysis, and (iii) it facilitates comparisons with scenarios without social influence. Using agent-based simulations we find that social social interaction leads to a larger increase in the average consumer welfare when there is at least some diversity of preferences in the consumer population.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 22:11:44 GMT  (833kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10970v1", "4 pages, 1 figure, originally presented at the collected intelligence (CI) conference in June 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 01:35:06 GMT  (843kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10970v2", "4 pages, 1 figure, originally presented at the collected intelligence (CI) conference in June 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 1 figure, originally presented at the collected intelligence (CI) conference in June 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["pantelis p analytis", "hrvoje stojic", "alexandros gelastopoulos", "mehdi moussa\\\"id"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10970"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.10970.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Diversity of preferences can increase collective welfare in sequential exploration problems", "authors": ["PANTELIS P.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "In search engines, online marketplaces, and other human-computer interfaces, large collectives of individuals interact sequentially with numerous alternatives of varying quality. In this context, individual trial and error (exploration) is critical to uncovering novel, high-quality objects or solutions, but entails high costs for individual actors [Frazier et al. 2014]. Confident decision-makers, we will show, are often better off imitating the decisions of individuals who have already accepted the costs of exploration. Although imitation makes sense on an individual level, it deprives the group of additional information that could have been collected by individual explorers [Rogers 1988]. Under these bleak circumstances, certain non-monetary mechanisms can keep the forces of imitation at bay and allow the collective to reap some of the benefits of independent exploration of information. Thus, for example, a natural balance between Kamakshi 1980 and Conlisk [imitators 1980 and Conlisk] may emerge."}, {"heading": "2. THE MODEL", "text": "We assume that there are N alternatives (or products) X1,..., XN in a market populated by M agents A1,..., AM. The alternatives have an objective benefit component uo, which is identical for all agents, and a subjective component us, which is agent-specific. The objective component of the alternative agents uo of each alternative is a draw from an independent and identically distributed (iid) random variable, which is normally distributed with the mean \u00b5o and the variance \u03c32o. The subjective component of the individual alternatives is iid normal with the mean \u00b5s and the variance \u03c32. The total usability of an alternative n is then a sum of two normal variables, un = uno + us, which is itself an iid normal variable with the variance \u03c32 = perception."}, {"heading": "3. SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS", "text": "We simulated markets consisting of 1000 agents who decided sequentially which of 100 utility options to choose after searching the market for public popularity information. We systematically varied the variety of preferences in the market by defining the subjective variance of each agent, which are the same as d, 0.1,..., 0.9, 1} and the variation of the objective utility options, which relate to 1 \u2212 d. We drew subjective utility options for each agent independently, whereas the drawing of the objective utility options for all agents varied the cost of the search that the agents have to pay when selecting an alternative, c = 22, 1 / 24, 1 / 25, 1 / 2. \"These costs correspond to the thresholds for all agents searching for the search, c that the agents have to pay if they make a selection that have to choose an alternative, c = 1, 1 / 23, 1 / 25, 1 search for the agents must match the cost of the search, c = 22, 1."}], "references": [{"title": "The collective dynamics of sequential search in markets for cultural products", "author": ["Pantelis P.

Self-interested decision makers, we will show, are often better off imitating the choices of individuals who have already incurred the costs of exploration.

Under these grim circumstances, certain non-monetary mechanisms can keep imitation forces in check and allow the collective to reap some of the benefits of the independent collection of information. For example, in simultaneous exploration problems, a natural equilibrium evolves between explorers and imitators [Conlisk 1980; Kameda and Nakanishi 2002]. Further, in some collective exploration settings, barriers to communication such as a sparser communication network among individuals can prove beneficial at the collective level. They encourage people to explore more, thus supplying useful information to the group [Fang et al. 2010; Lazer and Friedman 2007; Mason et al. 2008; Toyokawa et al. 2014]. Diversity is known to be a blessing for groups and collectives, as they can leverage the wealth of information possessed by different individuals [Conradt et al. 2013; Davis-Stober et al. 2014; M\u00fcllerTrede et al. 2017] or take advantage of the complementarities between group members to solve complex problems [Clearwater et al. 1991; Hong and Page 2004]. Could some preference diversity be beneficial in problems where collectives sequentially explore numerous alternatives, and thus despite reducing the immediate value of social learning lead to an increase in collective welfare?", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
