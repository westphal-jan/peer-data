In this paper, we investigate the problem of mining opinions by extracting aspects of entities on the collection of informal short texts. Both positive and negative sentiment strength of texts are detected. We focus on a non-English language that has few resources for text mining. This approach would help enhance the sentiment analysis in languages where a list of opinionated words does not exist. We propose a new method projects the text into dense and low dimensional feature vectors according to the sentiment strength of the words. We detect the mixture of positive and negative sentiments on a multi-variant scale.

Some approaches use uncontrolled (lexical) methods that use a dictionary or lexicon of pre-marked (positive-negative or mood) opinion words, known as polar words and mood words [9, 13, 17]. In addition to manually creating this list of words, it can be constructed automatically [7, 19]. As a classification problem [10, 15] a classifier is trained with a collection of marked corpus, using a selected feature vector and a monitored method of machine learning. Different types of feature vectors can be used to represent text in the classification. In addition to words, tags, emoticons, e.g. English, punctuation, a selected feature vector and a supervised method of learning."}, {"heading": "3 Methodology", "text": "This section describes our aspect-based sentiment model: First, we have a pre-processing step before converting text to feature vectors; second, we extract the sentiment of tweets and finally calculate the average sentiment value of tweets. Lexical and monitored approaches are combined to extract the sentiment value of each tweet. In the lexical approach, we need a sentiment word list. Manually creating a sentiment word list is time-consuming, so an automated method is proposed for this process; then we propose two methods to measure the sentiment strength of tweets. Additionally, SentiStrength [13] is configured for Turkish."}, {"heading": "3.1 Preprocessing", "text": "Before transforming the text into feature vectors, we remove these redundant parts of the text by applying various processes, such as punctuation and suffixes removal, spell-checking. A Turkish morphological analyzer, Zemberek [1], is used for these processes. Details of the pre-processing steps are skipped due to size limitations. As a further step before processing, we examine emoticons, which are also important symbols to represent opinion in the text. There are different types of emoticons used in the informal text. While some of them are used to express positive emotions, some of them are used for negative emotions. We group emoticons according to their respective sentiment value as \"positive,\" \"negative\" and \"other,\" and each group is given an icon. Afterwards, all the emoticons in the text are replaced by their symbols according to their feelings."}, {"heading": "3.2 Sentiment Word List Construction", "text": "As an alternative to the existing approaches, we propose a new approach to extracting opinion words and their emotional strength from a designated corpus, using relationships between words and classes. In [4], positive and negative words are extracted from documents of each class. In its algorithm, all documents are examined for each class C and words are classified by their frequency in the class document. A number of positive words with the highest score are designated as good predictors of this class. A word w is designated positive for a class c ifP (c | w) > 0.5% p + 0.5% P (c) (1), where p is a parameter used to counteract cases where the simpler relationship P (c | w) > P (c) results in a trivial acceptor / rejection, because too small / large values of P (c). Similarly to [4], we only extract positive words for each class. We have both 10 class values as the emotional strength of the text and 10 emotion values for the expression of 1 word, where the expression of 1 word is strength."}, {"heading": "3.3 Sentiment Strength Detection", "text": "We propose two methods to measure the sensitivity of tweets. As the basic method, we combine lexical and machine learning approaches, we call it Feature selectionusing sentiment Lexicon. As a second method, a new feature type, called Opinion Based Text Representation: Grouped, is created to represent the tweets. In addition to these, Sentistrength [13] is configured for Turkish as an alternative to them. Feature Selection using Sentiment Lexicon We use the lexicon to eliminate the words that do not affect the feel of the text. Only the words in the lexicon are retained and the others are removed. Instead of just looking for these words in the tweets as in the lexical approaches, we train a classifier with the words in the lexicon as the properties. To do this, we use the manually constructed and the automatically constructed lexicon documents mentioned in Section 3.2.Opinion Based Text Representation."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data", "text": "A collection of tweets across three different Turkish telecommunications brands collected over a month serves as a corpus for our experiment. Tweets are judged manually for positive and negative feelings on a 5-point scale as in [13]. After the elimination of junk tweets, our data set includes 1420 tweets. In addition, we manually create a lexicon of Turkish emotions, comprising 220 positive and negative words ranging from 1 to 5, following the format in SentiStrength [13] and booster words."}, {"heading": "4.2 Opinion Mining", "text": "We tested our new feature type, Opinion based text representation: Grouped, and our proposed algorithms on the Turkish tweet data set by using a cross-validation approach. The algorithms are called; with new representation Grouped with the word list constructed automatically Auto with the word list constructed manual. Also, the algorithms that contain all the words in the lexicographs are called Combin. We perform 10-fold cross-validation to train classifiers and to test our new feature type and algorithm. Different machine learning algorithms are used and the best with SVM is given in Table 1. The results of our algorithms were compared with the result of the basic majority class classification, the classification configured using BofW Feature Vectors type and SentiStrength for Turkish. For SentiStrength, we change its English word list to our manually constructed word list."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we present a framework for opinion-building by extracting aspects of units / topics through the collection of informal short texts. We focus on Turkish and present a methodology that can be applied to other languages where there are no rich resources. We propose a new method for creating sentiment word lists. We then calculate the sentiment strengths of the text using novel feature extraction algorithms. We apply feature selection by using sentiment lexicographs to reduce complexity and improve the accuracy of results. Our framework includes methods for constructing sentiment lexicographs and a novel opinion-based representation of text that can be applied to any language."}], "references": [{"title": "Zemberek, an open source nlp library for turkic", "author": ["Ahmet Afsin Akin", "Mehmet Dundar Akin"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Robust sentiment detection on twitter from biased and noisy data", "author": ["Luciano Barbosa", "Junlan Feng"], "venue": "In COLING", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Active learning for turkish sentiment analysis", "author": ["Mahmut Cetin", "Fatih Amasyali"], "venue": "INISTA,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Best terms: an efficient feature-selection algorithm for text categorization", "author": ["Dimitris Meretakis"], "venue": "Knowledge and Information Systems,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Enhanced sentiment learning using twitter hashtags and smileys", "author": ["Oren Tsur Dmitry Davidov", "Ari Rappoport"], "venue": "In COLING", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Sentiment analysis in turkish", "author": ["Umut Erogul"], "venue": "Master\u2019s thesis, Middle East Technical University,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Using wordnet to measure semantic orientation of adjectives", "author": ["Jaap Kamps", "Maarten Marx", "Robert J.
