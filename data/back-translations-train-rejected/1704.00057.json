Then, the user can ask for more information about a particular result or ask for other possibilities. If the user wants to know about database elements that belong to a different set of limitations (e.g. another bus line), these limitations simply override the previous ones."}, {"heading": "2 MOTIVATION", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have established in the past."}, {"heading": "3 DATA COLLECTION", "text": "We collected data over a period of 20 days with 12 participants. To increase diversity in the dialogs, 8 participants were recruited for just one week each and one participant for one day. The three remaining participants participated in the entire data collection process. Participants were selected for each dialogue and interacted via a chat interface."}, {"heading": "3.1 WIZARD-OF-OZ DATA COLLECTION", "text": "Collecting data for a goal-oriented dialogue is a challenge. To manage the data in such a way that specific aspects of the problem can be studied, it is common practice to collect dialogues using an automated system, which requires, for example, an understanding module of natural language that already responds well to the task, which implies possession of in-domain data or the ability to generate it (Henderson et al., 2014b; Raux et al., 2003). Another possibility that allows even greater control is to generate dialogues with a rules-based system (Bordes and Weston, 2016). These approaches are useful for studying specific modules and analyzing the behavior of different architectures. However, it is costly to generate new dialogues for each experiment and skill acquired in real-world environments because natural language understandings are not immediately usable (Bordes and Weston, 2016)."}, {"heading": "3.2 TASK TEMPLATES AND INSTRUCTIONS", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one will be able to go to a place where one is able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "3.3 DATABASE SEARCH INTERFACE", "text": "Wizards received a link to a search interface every time a user was connected to them. The search interface was a simple GUI with all searchable fields in the database (see Appendix A). For each search in the database, up to 10 results were displayed, sorted by rising prices."}, {"heading": "3.4 SUGGESTIONS", "text": "When a database query did not yield results, the wizards were sometimes shown suggestions. Suggestions were packages obtained by loosening one or more constraints. It was up to the wizard to decide whether to use suggestions or not. Our goal with suggestions is not to learn a recommendation system, but to learn the timing of the recommendation, hence the randomness of the mechanism."}, {"heading": "4 STATISTICS OF THE CORPUS", "text": "Figure 1a shows the distribution of dialog lengths in the corpus. The average number of revolutions is 15, for a total of 19986 revolutions in the dataset. One revolution is defined as a slack message sent by either a user or an assistant. A revolution of the user is always followed by a revolution of the wizard and vice versa. Figure 1b shows the number of revolutions per dialog rotation. Approximately 25% of dialog revolutions have more than one dialog act. Revolutions with 0 are revolutions where the user has asked for something that the wizard could not provide, e.g. because it was not part of the database. An example in the dataset is: \"Would my room have a view of the city? How much would it cost to switch to a room with a view?.\" We left such revolutions uncommented and they are usually tracked by the wizard, who says that they cannot provide the required information in Table 1c of Figure 1c, which shows the number of levels in the dialog."}, {"heading": "5 DIALOGUE ANNOTATION SCHEME", "text": "We commented on the frames record with three types of labels: 1. Dialog file, slot types, slot values, and references to other frames for each utterance. 2. The ID of the currently active frame. 3. Frame labels that were automatically calculated based on the two previous labels."}, {"heading": "5.1 DIALOGUE ACTS, SLOT TYPES, AND SLOT VALUES", "text": "Most of the dialog files used for commenting are files that normally occur in the target-oriented setting, such as information and quotation. We have also introduced dialog files that are specific to our frame tracking setting, such as switch boxes and request comparison. The dialog files are in Table 9. Our commentary uses three groups of slot types. The first sentence, listed in Tables 7 and 8, corresponds to the fields of the database. The second sentence is listed in Table 10 and contains the slot types that we have defined to describe certain aspects of the dialog, such as intention and action. An intention indicates whether the user wants to book a package or not, while an action indicates whether the wizard should book it or not. We have also introduced several slot types that are most commonly used by wizards to summarize information in the database, such as \"I have two hotels in Marseille.\" In this case, the wizard informs us that the frame for the number of the remaining slot in the table 10 is before the number of them."}, {"heading": "5.2 FRAMES", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 DEFINITION", "text": "Semantic frames form the core of our dataset. A semantic frame is defined by the following four components: \u2022 User Requests: Slots whose values the user wants to know for that frame. \u2022 User Requests: User queries with slot types and slot values. \u2022 Restrictions: Slots set to a certain value by the user or wizard. \u2022 User Comparison queries: Slots whose values the user wants to know for that frame and one or more other frames. Several of these labels are used in the Dialogue State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) (Williams et al., 2016). In DSTC, a semantic frame contains the restrictions set by the user, the user requests and the search method of the user (e.g. by constraints or alternatives). In our case, restrictions can also be set by the wizard when he suggests or offers me a packet. Each field in the database (see Tables 7 and 8 in Appendix A) can be compared by the user or the wizard."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 CREATION AND ANNOTATION", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "6 RESEARCH TOPICS", "text": "Frames can be used to explore many aspects of a goal-oriented dialogue, from Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to natural language generation. In this section, we propose three topics that we believe are new and representative of this dataset."}, {"heading": "6.1 FRAME TRACKING", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1.1 DEFINITION", "text": "Frame Tracking extends state tracking (Henderson, 2015; Williams et al., 2016) to a setting where multiple semantic frames are tracked at the same time. In state tracking, the dialog history is compressed into a semantic frame. Essentially, this means that each new slot value overrides the previous one, preventing the user from comparing options or returning to an item modified by the utterance. In frame tracking, a new value creates a new semantic frame. Frame tracking task is much more difficult because it requires identification of the active frame as well as all frames modified by the utterance for each user utterance. Definition 1 (Frame Tracking): With each turn of the user, we access the full dialog history H = {f1,..., fnt \u2212 1}, where fi is a frame and nt \u2212 1 is the number of frames previously generated in the dialog."}, {"heading": "6.1.2 EVALUATION METRICS", "text": "We define two key indicators: frame identification and frame creation. To identify the frame, we compare the truth pair (key value, frame) with the one predicted by the Frametracker for each dialog act. We calculate the performance as the number of correct predictions about the number of pairs. A prediction is only correct if frame, key and value are identical in the truth and prediction of the Frametracker. The frame is the ID of the referenced frame. Key and value are respectively the type and value of the slot used to refer to the frame (these can be zero).When creating the frame, we calculate the number of times the Frametracker correctly predicts that a frame will be created or correctly predicts that a frame will not be generated by the number of dialog rotations."}, {"heading": "6.1.3 RELATED WORK", "text": "An important contribution is the Task Lineage-based Dialog State Tracking (TL-DST) proposed by Lee and Stent, 2016. TL-DST is a framework that allows tasks to be tracked across different domains. Similar to Frame Tracking, Lee and Stent propose to build a dynamic structure of the dialog that contains different frames that correspond to different tasks, defining different sub-tasks under which frame parsing, which is closely related to frame tracking, except that they impose limitations on how a dialog act can be assigned to a frame and a dialog act can relate only to a frame that corresponds to different tasks. Due to the lack of data, Lee and Stent (2016) have trained their tracking model on records that have been released to DSTC."}, {"heading": "6.2 DIALOGUE MANAGEMENT", "text": "One of the most notable aspects of this data set is that memory is not just a question of image tracking. Mostly, the wizard talks about the current frame to ask or answer questions. However, sometimes, the wizard talks about previous frames. In order to reproduce such behavior, a dialogue manager would need to be able to identify potentially relevant frames for the current twist and output actions for those frames. Table 4 also illustrates another novelty. In italics, the wizard actually performs two actions: the first is to inform the user about the price of the royal resort, and the second is to suggest another option, Hotel Globetrotter. Performing more than one action per round is a challenge in using amplification of learning (Fatemi et al. 2016; Gas et al. 2011, et al.)."}, {"heading": "6.3 NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION", "text": "One interesting behavior observed in our data set is that wizards often tended to summarize database results, such as the wizard that says, \"The cheapest flight available is $1,077.14.\" In this case, the wizard informs the user that the database does not have a cheaper result than the one he is proposing. To imitate this behavior, a dialog system would have to think about the database and decide how to present the results to the user."}, {"heading": "7 DATASET FORMAT", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7.1 DIALOGUES", "text": "Each dialog has five main fields: Rotations, Labels, User ID, Wizard ID, and ID. The IDs are unique for each dialog (id), each user (user ID), and each wizard ID. Labels have two fields: \u2022 userSurveyRating of user cooperation on a scale from 1 to 5 (see Section 3). \u2022 wizardSurveyTaskSuccessful Wizard's perceived task fulfillment (see Section 3). The phrases have the following fields: \u2022 Author \"User Evaluation\" or \"Wizard.\" \u2022 Text Author's Statement. \"Labels the ID of the currently active frame (active) as well as a list of dialog activities (active)."}, {"heading": "7.2 HOTELS", "text": "A database of packages can be created by using the search results in the JSON files with the dialogs. Hotels in these search results have all the fields listed in the Hotel Properties section of Table 8 in Appendix A. Note that amenities or attractions near the hotel are only listed in the hotel description if they are true. For example, the field breakfast is only available for hotels that offer a complimentary breakfast. Figure 3 shows statistics for these Boolean values."}, {"heading": "8 BASELINES", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "8.1 NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING", "text": "We define the NLU task as forecasting and forecasting for the first three months of the year. The NLU meeting is a common part of understanding nature.

According to handcrafted rules, the frame tracker predicts the ref tags (for frame identification see Section 6.1.2) and frame creations. To perform an action a (k = v) in frame f, the following rules are used: \u2022 Create and switch to a new frame if a ref tag is set and f [k] is set, but v does not match f [k]. \u2022 Switch to frame g if a switch is found and g [k] matches frame v. If no match is found, we switch to the last frame g."}, {"heading": "9 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we introduced the Frames dataset: a corpus of human-human dialogs for exploring the role of memory in goal-oriented dialog systems. We presented this dataset for exploring memory in goal-oriented dialog systems. We formalized the frame-tracking task, which extends the task of state tracking to an environment in which multiple semantic frames are tracked simultaneously during the dialog. We proposed a baseline for this task and showed that there is much room for improvement. Finally, we showed that frames can be used to explore other interesting aspects of the dialog, such as the use of memory for dialogue management and information presentation by generating natural language. We propose adding memory as a first milestone toward goal-oriented dialog systems that support more complex dialog flows."}, {"heading": "A DATABASE OVERVIEW", "text": "Table 7: Searchable fields in the PackageField descriptionPRICE MAX Maximum price that the user is willing to pay PRICE MIN Minimum price defined by the user, START DATE Destination City MAX DURATION Maximum number of days for the journey ONLY ADULT Number of children START DATE Start date for the journey END DATE End date for the journey ART DATES FLEXIBLE Boolean value that indicates whether the user's dates are flexible or not.
