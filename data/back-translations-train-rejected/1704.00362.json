But machine learning usually creates static models from historical data. As the world changes, these models can become increasingly unreliable. There has been a very considerable effort to investigate methods for detecting concept drift (Kifer et al, 2004; Gama et al, 2004; Baena-Garc\u0131a et al, 2006; Dries und R\u00c3 \u00bc ckert, 2009; Bifet et al, 2013; Qahtan et al, 2015). However, in applications where drift is ongoing, these techniques may be of limited use as they should always represent flag drift as the present. In such cases, instead of simply marking whether drift occurs or not, it may be more useful to generate a detailed description of the nature and shape of drift. We call such a description a concept drift map. We call Geoffrey I.

While our techniques easily generalize to situations where there is no target attribute, in the current work we assume a classification learning context. As a result, we can consider the process that generates the stream as a common distribution via random variables Y and X = {X1,., Xn}, with y-dom (Y) being the class names and xi-dom (Xi) the attribute values. We offer a summary of the key symbols used in this essay in Table 1. To effectively estimate the distribution of probability at a given time, we add a time subscript, such as Pt (X, Y), to define a probability distribution at a given time. It is often impractical to effectively estimate the distribution at a given time and for that purpose."}, {"heading": "3 Measuring total drift magnitude", "text": "In fact, it is not as if we were able to see ourselves as we were able to see ourselves as we were able to see ourselves in the past.

One problem that arises from this is how to estimate the required probability distributions from the available data. However, in order to manage the variance in the estimates, it is important to derive it from sufficiently large data samples (such as the distribution for a given hour, day, or week). However, this handy driver is not the only reason for considering the drift between extended time periods rather than the drift between instantaneous points in time. As we show in Section 6, looking at the drift between periods of different granularity can be extremely instructive."}, {"heading": "5 Methods for communicating drift maps", "text": "Our primary technique measures boundary deviations between periods. Sometimes, it will be interesting to consider a single such comparison at a given time. At other times, it will be useful to think about how deviations unfold over a longer period of time, which can result in a very large number of individual deviations. At this point, we present methods for communicating this large amount of information.For deviations between two periods, the key information we want to convey is the relative extent of the deviation in any combination of attributes. We find that thermal imaging maps are a highly effective means of doing this, clearly highlighting the interactions between the variables. We provide examples in Figures 11 to 14. We use line diagrams to communicate the evolution of the deviation over longer periods of time."}, {"heading": "6 Illustrative examples", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into a different world, in which they are able to move, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and Future Research", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will be able to retaliate in order to reewnn, \"he says.\" It's as if we will be able to reewnn, \"he says.\" It's as if we will be able to reewnn, \"he says.\" It's as if we will be able to reewnn, \"he says.\" It's as if we will be able to reewnn, \"he says."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the Australian Research Council under the awards DP140100087 and DE170100037.
