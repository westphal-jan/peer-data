In this survey we introduce and discuss two types of rumours that circulate on social media; long-standing rumours that circulate for long periods of time, and newly-emerging rumours spawned during fast-paced events such as breaking news, where reports are released piecemeal and often with an unverified status in their early stages. We provide an overview of research into social media rumours with the ultimate goal of developing a rumour classification system that consists of four components: rumour detection, rumour tracking, rumour stance classification and rumour veracity classification. We delve into the approaches presented in the scientific literature for the development of each of these four components. We summarise the efforts and achievements so far towards the development of rumour classification systems and conclude with suggestions for avenues for future research in social media mining for detection and resolution of rumours.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 15:57:44 GMT  (77kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00656v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.HC cs.IR cs.SI", "authors": ["arkaitz zubiaga", "ahmet aker", "kalina bontcheva", "maria liakata", "rob procter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00656"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.00656.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Detection and Resolution of Rumours in Social Media: A Survey", "authors": ["Arkaitz Zubiaga", "Ahmet Aker", "Maria Liakata"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 4.00 656v 1 [cs.C L] 3A pr2 017Detection and Resolution of Rumours in Social Media: A SurveyArkaitz Zubiaga, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK Ahmet Aker, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK and University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany Kalina Bontcheva, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK Maria Liakata, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK Rob Procter, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK Despite the increasing use of social media platforms for information and news gathering, its inordinacy often leads to the emergence and dissemination of rumors, i.e. sharing of information that is not verified at the time of publication.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "Social media is increasingly being used as a tool to gather information about, for example, societal problems [Lazer et al. 2009] and to learn about the latest developments in connection with breaking news [Phuvipadawat and Murata 2010]. This is possible because these platforms allow anyone with an Internet-connected device to share their thoughts in real time and / or post an update on an unfolding event they may be witnessing. Therefore, social media has become a powerful tool for journalists [Diakopoulos et al. 2012; Tolmie et al. 2017a], but also for ordinary citizens [Hermida 2010]. While social media provides access to an unprecedented source of information, the lack of systematic efforts to moderate posts leads to the dissemination of misinformation [Procter et al. 2013b; Webb et al. 2016], which requires additional efforts to establish its provenance and truthfulness."}, {"heading": "1.1. Defining and Characterising Rumours", "text": "In our work, we have adopted rumors as the defining characteristic of rumors that they are not verified at the time of publication, which is consistent with the definition used by major dictionaries, such as the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines a rumor as \"a currently circulating story or report of uncertain or dubious truth1, or the Merriam Webster Dictionary, which defines it as\" a statement or report with no known authority for its truth. \""}, {"heading": "1.2. Studying Rumours: From Early Studies to Social Media", "text": "This is an example of how people have behaved in recent years. To overcome this obstacle, Allport undertook early investigations [Allport and Postman 1946] in the context of rumors, as this would result in a real-time collection of responses to how rumors unfold, provided the participants have already been recruited. To overcome this obstacle, Allport undertook early investigations [Allport and Postman 1946; 1947] in the context of war rumors. He postulated the importance of studying rumors and stressed that \"newsworthy events are likely to give rise to rumors\" and that \"the amount of rumors in circulation will vary.\" The importance of individuals dealing with the ambiguity of the evidence that relates to the issue. \"This led him to ask a motivational question that has not yet been answered:\" Can rumors be understood and controlled scientifically? \""}, {"heading": "1.3. Scope and Organisation", "text": "This survey is motivated by the increasing use of social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter to post and discover information. While we acknowledge its undeniable usefulness for collecting often exclusive information, its openness, its lack of moderation, and the ease with which information can be posted from anywhere, anytime, no doubt leads to major problems for quality assurance of information. Given the unease that the spread of rumors can cause, and the potential harm, the incentive for developing data mining tools to deal with rumors has increased in recent years. We continue this survey in Section 2 by examining the opportunities that social media can bring to numerous areas, while also presenting the new challenge of dealing with rumors."}, {"heading": "2. SOCIAL MEDIA AS AN INFORMATION SOURCE: CHALLENGES POSED BY RUMOURS", "text": "Social media is increasingly being used as a source of information by both a range of professionals and end-users to learn about the latest developments and current events [Van Dijck 2013; Fuchs 2013]. The use of social media has proven useful for disseminating opinions in a wide variety of areas; we describe some of the most notable uses below: news collections have shown great potential for disseminating news that occasionally even surpasses professional news media in breaking news reporting [Kwak et al. 2010]. This allows, among other things, access to eyewitness updates and a wide range of users who have access to potentially exclusive information [Diakopoulos et al. 2012; Starbird et al. 2012]. Aiming to exploit this feature of social media platforms, researchers have examined the development of news collection tools [Zubiaga et al. 2013; Diakopoulos et al. 2012; Marcus et al. 2011], analyzing the use of user-reported content for news content (UC)."}, {"heading": "3. DATA COLLECTION AND ANNOTATION", "text": "This section describes various strategies for collecting social media data that allow rumors to be investigated, as well as approaches to collecting comments on the data."}, {"heading": "3.1. Access to Social Media APIs", "text": "The best way to access, collect and store data from social media platforms is usually through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) from Twitter (APIs) [Lomborg and Bechmann 2014]. APIs are easy-to-use interfaces that are usually accompanied by documentation describing how to request the data you are interested in. They are designed to be retrieved from other applications as opposed to web interfaces that are designed for people; APIs provide a set of well-defined methods that an application can rely on to request data. For example, in a social media platform you can retrieve any data that is posted by a specific user, or any posts that contain a specific keyword. Before using an API is a crucial first step to reading its documentation and understanding its methods and limitations. In fact, each social media platform has its own limitations and this is key if you want to use Twitter data that are a rumor classification system that uses social media to populate the social media platform."}, {"heading": "3.2. Rumour Data Collection Strategies", "text": "Collection of social media data relevant to the development of rumor classifiers is not simply a priori, and a careful data collection strategy needs to be defined in order to come up with good datasets. For other social media mining applications, it might then simply be enough to define the rumors already implemented in the APIs of social media platforms, such as: (1) collecting data by keyword to collect data related to an event [Driscoll and Walker 2014]; (2) defining a Bounding Box to collect data from predefined geographical locations [Frias-Martinez et al. 2012]; or (3) listing a number of users of interest to track their posts [Li and Cardie 2014]. Collection of rumors requires combining one of these implemented approaches to recover data applicable to the rumor classification. We classify the different data collection strategies applied to the two levels of literature."}, {"heading": "3.3.

CHARACTERISING RUMOURS: UNDERSTANDING RUMOUR DIFFUSION AND FEATURES", "text": "Many recent studies have looked at the characterization of the origin and spread of rumor on social media. Findings from these studies may in turn be useful to inform the development of rumor classification systems. Some of this research has focused on comprehensive analysis of rumor, while others have looked at larger groups of rumor to conduct more comprehensive analysis. Studies of discourses around rumor have been conducted to investigate discussions around - and the evolution of - rumor over time. Some studies have focused on defining a scheme for categorizing reaction types versus rumor-related rumor types. [Maddock et al. 2015] looked at the origins and changes in rumor over time that have led to the identification of seven behavioral responses to rumor: misinformation, speculation, questions, hedges, or neutral / other. [Procter et al] suggested that responses to rumor may be categorized. 2013b] suggested that responses to rumor might be categorized into four additional types of information, namely, four types of rumor types of attraction."}, {"heading": "5. RUMOUR CLASSIFICATION: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE", "text": "The architecture of an odor classification system can vary slightly depending on the application. Here, we define a typical architecture for an odor classification system that includes all the components necessary for a complete system. However, as we specify in the descriptions below, some of these components can be omitted. The entire process starts with the identification of people who are not confirmed (i.e., odor detection) and ends with the determination of the estimated value of information (i.e., the custody of odor traces). The entire process is carried out from the custody to the custody of odor traces."}, {"heading": "6. RUMOUR DETECTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1. Definition of the Task and Evaluation", "text": "The task of detecting rumors is that a system must determine, based on a series of social media posts, which messages spread rumors and thus spread information that has yet to be verified. Note that the fact that a tweet is a rumor does not imply that it is later considered true or false, but that it is not verified at the time of publication. Formally, the task considers a timeframe of social media posts TL = {t1,..., t | TL |} as input, and the classifier must determine whether each of these posts, ti, is a rumor or or a non-rumor by assigning a label of Y = {R, NR}. Thus, the task is usually formulated as a binary classification problem whose performance is evaluated by calculating the accuracy, recall, and F1 values for the target category, i.e. rumors."}, {"heading": "6.2. Datasets", "text": "The only publicly available data set is the PHEME data set of rumors and non-rumors [Zubiaga et al. 2016b], which contains a collection of 1,972 rumors and 3,830 non-rumors associated with five breaking news."}, {"heading": "6.3. Approaches to Rumour Detection", "text": "Despite the growing interest in analyzing rumors on social media and building tools to deal with rumors that had not previously been identified [Seo et al. 2012; Takahashi and Igata 2012], there was very little work in automatically detecting rumors. Some of the tweets in the detection of rumors [Qazvinian et al. 2011; Hamidian and Diab 2015; 2016] were limited to finding rumors based on predefined rumors (e.g. Obama is Muslim) that classify new tweets as related to one of the known rumors (e.g., I think Obama is not Muslim informed about the rumor, while Obama was talking to a group of Muslims who should not be monitored). An approach like this can be useful for long-standing rumors where one wants to identify relevant tweets to track the rumors that have already been identified; in this survey, we refer to this task as rumor tracking because one is aware of the rumors that are being monitored."}, {"heading": "7. RUMOUR TRACKING", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7.1. Definition of the Task and Evaluation", "text": "The Rumor Tracker component is triggered as soon as a rumor is detected, and consists of identifying subsequent posts related to the rumor to be monitored. Input typically consists of a stream of posts that can be tailored to the rumor after filtering by relevant keywords, or it can be expanded by including posts related to a major event or even an unlimited stream of posts. Generally, the task is defined as a binary classification task, which is to determine whether or not each of the posts is related to the rumor. Output will be a labeled version of the posting stream, in which labels define whether or not each post is related. Traditional binary classification evaluation methods are used for this task, namely precision, recall, and F1 score, where the positive class is the number of related posts."}, {"heading": "7.2. Datasets", "text": "The most commonly used rumor tracking data set is that of [Qazvinian et al. 2011], which includes over 10,000 tweets associated with 5 different rumors, with each tweet being commented as related or unrelated due to its relevance to the rumor. Unrelated tweets have similar characteristics to related ones, such as overlapping keywords, making classification more difficult. Although not specifically intended for rumor tracking, the [Zubiaga et al. 2016] data set provides over 4,500 tweets categorized by rumor. This data set differs in that it does not contain tweets with similar characteristics that are actually unrelated. Instead, it provides tweets associated with various rumor and tweets grouped by rumor."}, {"heading": "7.3. Approaches to Rumour Tracking", "text": "Despite the early work of [Qazvinian et al. 2011], which performs automated rumor tracking, few studies have subsequently followed their research line when it comes to determining the relevance of tweets to rumor. [Qazvinian et al. 2011] use a manually generated Twitter dataset of 10K tweets to derive a supervised machine learning approach. Authors use various functions categorized as \"content,\" \"network\" and \"Twitter-specific memes.\" However, the content category contains unigrams, bigrams and their part of speech (POS) tags as characteristics. In the network category, authors consider retweets (RT) as a feature. Finally, Twitter-specific memes include content characteristics derived from hashtags and URLs. A Bayesian classifier is used as a machine learning approach. The best performance was achieved by using content-based characteristics, with an average accuracy of 6.5% in 2015 and higher, with an average accuracy of 9% in 2011."}, {"heading": "8. RUMOUR STANCE CLASSIFICATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "8.1. Definition of the Task and Evaluation", "text": "The task of classifying rumors is to determine the type of orientation that each individual post expresses with respect to the disputed veracity of a rumor. The task is particularly interesting in the context of social media, where unverified reports are continuously posted and discussed, both on news sites like 12https: / / www.wiktionary.org / they unfold as well as on longstanding rumors. A classifier of rumors usually takes a series of rumors D = {R1,..., Rn}, where each rumor consists of a collection of posts discussing it. Each rumor has a different number of posts discussing it, so Ri = {t1,..., t | Ri |}; the task is to determine the position of each post in connection with a rumor Ri. The classification scheme used to determine the position of each post varies well in different studies, while early work [Qazvinian et al. 2011] supports a dual classification of {Y = 2015er supporting a similar classification of Y = 2015er."}, {"heading": "8.2. Datasets", "text": "Position classification work has used various datasets, although the only publicly available dataset is the PHEME position dataset 13, which contains Tweet-level annotations of posture (support, refusal, query, comment) for tweets related to nine events.

Definition of the Task and Evaluation", "text": "The task of Truth Classification is to determine whether a particular rumor has to be confirmed as true, debunked as false, or its truth value has yet to be clarified. In light of a number of posts associated with a rumor, and optionally additional sources associated with the rumor, the task is to assign one of the following terms to the rumor: \"Y.\" Some papers have limited the classification to a binary task of determining whether a rumor is true or false, but it is likely that the truth value remains uncertain for some rumors.

Rumours, Hoaxes, Misinformation, Disinformation, Fake News", "text": "As defined in Section 1.1, rumors refer to portions of information that begin with unconfirmed statements; the truth value of a rumor cannot be verified at an early stage, but is subsequently resolved as true or false within a relatively short period of time, or may remain unconfirmed for a long time; a number of similar terms are also used in related literature that have different characteristics but also similarities with rumors; the term misinformation is used to refer to the dissemination of information that is false as a result of an honest mistake, while disinformation refers to information that is intentionally false [Hernon 1995]. Rumors can fall into either of these two categories, depending on the intent of the source; however, the main difference is that rumors are not necessarily false but turn out to be false."}, {"heading": "11.3.

At the same time, the openness of social media platforms provides opportunities to study how users share and discuss rumours, and to explore how natural language processing and data mining techniques may be used to find ways of determining their veracity. In this survey we introduce and discuss two types of rumours that circulate on social media; long-standing rumours that circulate for long periods of time, and newly-emerging rumours spawned during fast-paced events such as breaking news, where reports are released piecemeal and often with an unverified status in their early stages. We provide an overview of research into social media rumours with the ultimate goal of developing a rumour classification system that consists of four components: rumour detection, rumour tracking, rumour stance classification and rumour veracity classification. We delve into the approaches presented in the scientific literature for the development of each of these four components. We summarise the efforts and achievements so far towards the development of rumour classification systems and conclude with suggestions for avenues for future research in social media mining for detection and resolution of rumours.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.996 Copyright 2016 Radical Eye Software"}}}
