[Way back in 1936], Alan Turing gave us the tools to understand the depth and breadth of the concept that we now identify as \"computer universality,\" that is, the ability of certain computer programs and actual mechanical and electronic computers to perform any task that can be algorithmically described. Your laptop or tablet can play music, draw a graph, or serve as a typewriter. This is because it is reprogrammable; it can emulate any computer program that is reprogrammable for a computer but requires very few elements. For example, a tape and a writing head can make a reprogrammable computer, just as DNA, with a splitting operation driven by chemical reactions, can emulate the achievement of computer universality. But while scientists have known that most computers are universal, until now we have not known to what extent computer programs are similar, driven by chemical reactions, can be reprogrammed almost by any technique that we were able to use in a computer program."}, {"heading": "4 Ubiquitousness of Universal Computation", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the question of how this could have come about is not a purely formal question, but rather the question of how it could have come to this point in the first place."}, {"heading": "1.
