Introduction", "text": "Today, Swarm Intelligence (SI) is a remarkable and important area of ArtificialIntelligence related to informatics. The scope of research in this area is related to problem-solving approaches in the use of collective behavior of natural or artificial self-organized structures or systems. In this sense, many different types of SI-based algorithms have been introduced to provide better solutions to particularly real problems. SI and the associated work volume is very active, and newer and more advanced algorithms aimed at providing better approaches than the current ones are still being designed and developed rapidly. As parallel to the aforementioned efforts, there is also a notable need for researchers to benefit from tools, programs or general software systems that provide solution approaches to SI-based algorithms, the aim of this paper is to introduce a software system that will use widely used Swarm intelligence algorithms for research or to apply common work environments."}, {"heading": "2. Foundations", "text": "With this in mind, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Intelligent Water Drops (IWD) Algorithm and Firefly Algorithm (FA) have been incorporated into the software platform. Algorithms have been selected for their popularity and / or interesting properties in the context of problem-solving approaches. In order not to interfere with the flow of paper and its readability, readers are referred to some key references to learn more about the mentioned algorithms. Related references are listed below: PSO is a global optimization algorithm introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart."}, {"heading": "3.1. Programmatic infrastructure", "text": "Essentially, the programmatic infrastructure of the software system is based on separate application codes that are combined within a single software system platform. In this sense, the entire system was programmed using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 platform using the C # programming language. As previously mentioned, the system is based on a typical form-based software approach, and each application form associated with a specific SI-based algorithm includes its own code structure as independent of others and connected to the main software system interface. In short, this infrastructure can be presented in a scheme, as shown in Fig. 1.Band 3, Issue 3, October 2012, ISSN 2067-3957 (online), ISSN 2068 - 0473 (print)."}, {"heading": "3.2. Using features and functions", "text": "In this sense, any algorithm used in the software system can be achieved by using the buttons listed below through the main interface of the software system (Form - Window). Clicking on the button will see the corresponding window of the selected SI-based algorithm. On a typical button - Window - it is possible to execute the buttons listed below: Define a new problem and new parameters in order to perform a solution task related to the scope of the problem of the algorithm. Opening a saved or predefined problem file in order to perform newer solution-based tasks according to various parameters or structure combinations related to the algorithm (To ensure a fast and precise working method, \"problem files\" are stored in XML file format."}, {"heading": "4. Evaluation", "text": "In order to get a more accurate idea of the effectiveness and success of the software system, it was used by a total of 50 different scientists - researchers for two weeks and after the period of use, the related scientists - researchers have completed a survey which contains some statements about the use and effectiveness of the system. The relevant survey comprises a total of 10 statements which can be evaluated using the Likert scale. In this sense, scientists - researchers have entered \"1\" if they strongly disagree, \"2\" if they do not have a clear opinion, \"3\" if they do not have a clear opinion, \"4\" if they agree and \"5\" if they strongly agree with a given statement. Related results of the survey can be seen in Table 1.Volume 3, Issue 3, October 2012, ISSN 2067-3957 (online), ISSN 2068 - 0473 (printed). There must be more SI-based algorithms within the software system 0-0 general characteristics of this software system."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions and future work", "text": "In this sense, the system also provides visually enhanced controls to improve the overall use of experience. In addition, the system also has predefined problem files specially prepared for the widespread algorithms within the system. According to the evaluation results obtained with a simple study, all the mentioned advantages of the system are also confirmed and as general, the software system is rated as an effective and successful platform that can easily be used for conducting SI-based research studies. In addition to the positive feedback expressed, some evaluation results (survey results) have encouraged the author to plan some future work."}], "references": [{"title": "Particle swarm optimization", "author": ["Kennedy J", "Eberhart RC"], "venue": "Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks;", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1995}, {"title": "An analysis of publications on particle swarm optimisation applications", "author": ["R.
