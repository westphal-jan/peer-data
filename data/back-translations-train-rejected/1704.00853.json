In the case of adaptive storage algorithms, the flip side is to select certain attributes of solutions to define the taboo status (i.e. to determine conditions under which certain movements should be prohibited) in order to produce the highest quality solutions. Recent studies by Wang et al. (2017) and Wu et al. (2017) have documented the effects of attribute selection strategies by applying a balance between attributes that consist of hash-coded solutions (based on ideas by Woodruff and Zemel (1993) and more commonly used attributes.

Highly effective metaheuristics for solving the QUBO problems identified in Wang et al. (2015) have led to additional applications in the field of quantum computing, such as those in Rosenberg et al.

In this chapter, we have tried to clarify evolution in this area by not focusing exclusively on important events or publications, but by trying to identify the important paradigm shifts that the field has been engaged in. However, what is certain is that the use of metaheuristics is much older, much older than the term itself. As mentioned earlier, our brain itself harbors some powerful metaheuristics that have helped humans survive since the dawn of mankind. However, scientific research into metaheuristics had to wait until the second half of the previous century. Scientific communities inevitably develop a conceptual framework within which a few axioms are held true, and this can also be said by the metaheuristics community. It is these common truths that we have tried to uncover in this chapter. Although the field of metaheuristics has been changing for several years, it is still early in the practice of metaheuristics."}], "references": [{"title": "Supply chain disruption mitigation", "author": ["Pei"], "venue": "Schmitt et al", "citeRegEx": "Pei,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Pei", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Dynamic memory allocation problems S\u00e1nchez-Oro et al.
