Although motion gaming offers health benefits, we should also pay attention to its negative effects, such as repeated strains and muscle imbalances that can occur when some parts of the body are under too much stress (R\u00f6ssler et al. 2014). For the development of sustainable well-being, it is also important to balance the use between the right and left sides of the body; it is noted that muscle imbalance - which leads to discomfort, injury and other physical discomfort that causes pain - is often found in those who play one-sided sports such as tennis (Maffetone 2015). As a solution, we propose an AI that encourages the player to use the left and right sides of the body in a balanced way, with the way in which the movement is played being determined by the players."}, {"heading": "Backgrounds", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Games for Health and Motion Gaming", "text": "In the history of games research, it has been claimed that video games can be used to provide people of all ages with an effective and attractive means of exercise and rehabilitation (Baranowski et al. 2016). Exergames is an important innovator and a leading voice in health care. Nevertheless, there are of course critics and questions about whether it is really necessary and effective while we still have traditional means of exercise such as exercise in the gym and sports (Barry et al. 2016). To answer the above question and understand how G4H came to this success, we will look back at the problems and facts underlying today's society. It has been reported that only about 20% of American adults meet physical activity guidelines and less than 30% of high school 1 measures: an attack or movement in the game, such as light blow and heavy blow. In this essay, \"actions\" refer to the actions of AI, while the actions of the player are referred to as \"countermeasures.\" Students get at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day (CDC)."}, {"heading": "UKI for full-body motion gaming", "text": "A study of 109 articles found that Kinect was recognized among gaming devices for its potential in providing full-body motion games for health promotion and rehabilitation. However, since motion games are usually developed specifically and their development requires more time and effort, few games are available on the market and a limited variety of genres makes motion games available only to a niche group of gamers. UKI's project was launched with the aim of offering middleware that can facilitate the integration of whole-body control with all existing games and applications (Paliyawan and Thawonmas 2017). In addition to such integration, we are also adding several features to improve usage, such as a module that allows the user to introduce new motions into the system by simply executing them (Paliyawan et al. 2015) and a module to monitor health risks based on an ergonomic tool REBA (Paliyawan and Thawonmas 2016)."}, {"heading": "FightingICE for health promotion", "text": "Characteristics of combat games that improve the results of exergaming are stated as follows: \u2022 Adaptability of the difficulty of the exercise to each individual player. \u2022 If the difficulty matches the player, it would optimize health outcomes, reduce frustration and maintain the interest of the player. This characteristic can be effectively implemented in combat games by offering a suitable opposing AI for each game difficulty. \u2022 Clear victory condition is an important psychological factor in exergaming. If the player identifies himself as the winner, it could lead to positive social comparisons and improved competition that serves as an encouragement for further gameplay. \u2022 Simplicity is preferred, while detailed tutorials can contribute to frustration and boredom. Fighting games are simple and can be played without tutorials. A health-enhancing AI is implemented for FightingICE, the combat playsite for AI development and competition IEZ that is organized and maintained by our laboratory. Since 2014, an artificial intelligence competition is being conducted annually with KI Intelligence for FightICE, the IEIG Research Conference."}, {"heading": "Health Promotion AI", "text": "Health Promotion AI (HP-AI) is our contribution in this paper; it is the result of the integration of several health promotion concepts from a number of our previous work with AI development. A framework for assessing the health of players during the whole body movement game was introduced (Paliyawan and Thawonmas 2016); we introduced the use of UKI to analyse the extent of body movements and to assess the postural risks on body segments. As a first step to what we have said in this paper, we focus on the analysis of postural risks in the balanced use of body segments, which is said to be an important key for healthy intensive exercises (Maffetone 2015); this seems perfectly suited for the movement game with combat games. In this work, we introduce HP-AI by using MctsAi (Yoshida et al. 2016) as the base algorithm. It is noted that in many AI competitions the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MceTS) is the first winner of the AIS and ATS competition."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "We have conducted a survey on existing work that uses Kinect for health promotion, the details of which are summarised in Table 1. For more information, see Da Gama's paper (Da Gama et al. 2015). It is pointed out that artificial intelligence for health promotion is a new concept, and to the best of our knowledge there is still no artificial intelligence in movement play, particularly in the fight against artificial intelligence, for health promotion."}, {"heading": "Proposed AI", "text": "The AI analyses the health of the player in real time and uses supporting data from databases to determine its next step (i.e. the optimal action), which prioritises improving the health of the player, followed by the strength of the action. In this section, we first provide definition and details for calculating two basic data used in the system: (1) body movement dynamics (2) probability of action to response, and then describe how the AI obtains and processes data to determine its next action."}, {"heading": "Data and databases", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Momentum of body movement", "text": "The raw data collected by Kinect are 3D positions (x, y and z) of 20 body joints. First, the coordination is localized to make the data invariably relative to the standing position of the player. Second, the joints on the torso are centered on the coordination of the shoulder, while the joints on the lower body are centered to center one of the hip joints. Second, the relative change between each pair of consecutive frames is calculated by using the euclidean distance. Third, the joints are omitted in the center of the body, and the remaining joints are grouped into 4 segments that are a pair of arms and a pair of legs (Figure 3). Changes in the joints in the same segment are summed up by a change in the segment. Finally, changes to a segment of interest are accumulated over time and represented by an impulse in equivalent. (1) The motion database contains information about how much the body segments of the player are moving when he or she executes a motion, each of which is referred to as a momentary motion (M2)."}, {"heading": "Action-to-counteraction probability", "text": "The Action-to-Counteraction probability (A2C) is calculated based on the game log; it represents the probability that the player is inclined to counteract when the AI performs a particular action. A counteraction is the player's first action after the AI action. As one action may lead to different counteractions, the probability is used to represent a series of counteractions by the player against the action of a particular AI. A2Cs for all possible actions in the game are stored in a database, namely the Action History Database (see Figure 4) - this database is based on log data from 45 rounds of battle: 5 subjects, 9 rounds / subjects. Processes for determining optimal actions In this section, we describe MCTS and processes in the system (rounded rectangles in Figure 2)."}, {"heading": "Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)", "text": "We embed a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) module from MctsAi (Yoshida et al. 2016) to our AI. This module analyses the state of the game and recommends n candidate actions for the proposed AI, selecting one of them as the optimal action. The search module provides the best action by taking into account the strength of the action taking into account a particular game situation. It is noted that when n is set to 1, HP-AI only applies the strongest action, and if the value of n is too large, HP-AI is weakened; the value of n can be used to control the difficulty of the game and its value is set to 3 in this study. MCTS is a combination of tree search algorithm and Monte-Carlo method; it uses random samples in exploring the decision room. There are four important steps in MCTS: selection, expansion, simulation and backpropagation."}, {"heading": "Predicting effects on player\u2019s heath", "text": "We use a search module from MctsAi to analyze the game situation and recommend three candidate actions, in which one of the three actions is selected as the optimal action of the AI. A search module delivers candidate actions by taking into account the strength of the actions in a particular game state. For each candidate action (referred to as A), the AI predicts its impact on the impulses of the body segments of the player (referred to as A2Mm) by using A2C, C2M and M2Mm in the respective order. In addition, the table A2Mm for all actions can also be created in advance and stored permanently during the game to shorten the processing time."}, {"heading": "Health assessment", "text": "The proposed AI calculates the expected impulses (EM) for body segments using AM, assuming that the impulse of a particular segment corresponds to its pair on the opposite side of the body; for each segment we use the maximum impulses in its pair as the expected moments, as shown in Equation (6).The gap referred to in Equation (7) is then calculated as a series of differences from EM to AM; from this group it is known which segments of the body should move more and how much it should move.These data are sent by UKI to the proposed AI as the current state of health of the player for further processing, processing, processing, processing (max, 5, 5, max, 5)."}, {"heading": "Select an optimal action", "text": "The aim of AI is to maximize the balance of training, with such balance (referred to as ball) being calculated by Equation (8).The value of Bal is in the range of [0, 1], with a value of 1 indicating that two sides of the body move in a perfectly balanced manner. 1 2) If a reduction in the gaps results in an increase in Bal, the AI evaluates the fitness of each candidate by estimating how many gaps will decrease if it performs this action (Equation (9).An example in Figure 4 shows that if Skill _ A is performed by the AI, the gaps are projected to be reduced by about 5.04, which will improve Bal from 86.92% to 88.16%."}, {"heading": "Evaluation and Result", "text": "There are five people involved in this experiment, each of whom plays FightingICE for 9 rounds (3 games, 3 rounds per game) against MctsAI and 9 rounds against HP-AI. Using the collected data, we first analyze the gap between actual and expected moments of the player during the game. Lines in Figure 6 represent sums of actual and expected moments across four body segments; their values are accumulated over time. Gap is a gap between two lines. It is obvious that the gap is smaller when the player fights HP-AI.

Our result shows possibilities for the development of a combat game AI that can effectively detect the behaviour of the player, analyze the health of the player and define measures that induce the player to exercise in a healthy way. Our future work includes the development of additional modules to evaluate and improve other health factors, such as postural risk, energy expenditure and physical activity. Designing health reports and their visualisation to promote the motivation of the user and lead to sustainable well-being is also a challenging topic."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "Special thanks to Makoto Ishihara for his explanations and details on how MCTS-based AI works."}], "references": [{"title": "Exercise-based injury prevention in child and adolescent sport: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "author": ["R.
