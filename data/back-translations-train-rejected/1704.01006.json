[6]"}, {"heading": "III. RELATED WORK", "text": "A substantial part of the contributions comes from work done in recent years to assess the situation and behavior planning. [9] They describe how ontologies can be applied to model interactions based on spatio-temporal relationships between road users and infrastructure, and are used to infer how classified object groups behave and interact with the host vehicle in the future. Sensor data is used as input for an ontology and to develop a human understanding of the scene, based on object traces, map data, and dynamic states of the host vehicle. Therefore, the concept classes are divided into mobile entities, static entities, and context parameters that describe spatio-temporal relationships. Relationships between the classes are described by object characteristics for actual behavior, how they move toward or behave to maintain safe traffic."}, {"heading": "IV. ONTOLOGY-BASED SCENE CREATION", "text": "As in the early days, automated vehicles must achieve a large number of operational scenarios during their lifespan. Prior to deploying automated vehicles on public transport, developers must examine these scenarios in the development process to ensure that safe systems are in place. Go and Carroll [20] describe this approach as a scenario-based design paradigm for complex systems, requiring multiple views of the same set of operating scenarios for a system from different stakeholders to meet well-developed requirements. For automated vehicles, the system can be analyzed from multiple angles, including defining the behavior of the system, interacting with the human machine, risk analysis, and the process of going to costly field tests."}, {"heading": "A. Knowledge acquisition", "text": "In Germany, there are guidelines for the creation of motorways, rural roads, inner-city roads, crash infrastructure, markings, traffic lights and signs, which are updated periodically to new regulations. There are also various catalogues of scenarios from past projects or system descriptions, which contain knowledge of scenarios. These sources can also be used if the nomenclature of scenarios is correctly translated. As Geyer et al. [18] describes, each project or catalogue has its own nomenclatures and concepts of how knowledge can be organized. Guidelines apply to entire areas of traffic. The number of scenes that can be created by combining all units of an area is very large. However, only a selection of scenarios is relevant for the investigation, depending on the functional area."}, {"heading": "B.

Process for creation of traffic scenes", "text": "Once the ontology has been modeled for the given use case, the creation process uses the knowledge to create valid traffic scenarios. Ontology bundles units in natural language and assigns them a formal order through conceptualization. We propose to model parameter relationships with data properties in ontology. Each unit (represented by a word) in ontology represents multiple relationships to parameters in physical state space. Roads on the transport network can include parameters such as width, state, and coefficient of friction. To represent layer interactions, we comment on whether a unit includes or affects a parameter. For example, rain in the weather layer has an impact on the coefficient of friction enclosed in the first layer. To create all possible traffic scenarios from a given ontology, we have to derive assertion boxes. This remains in contrast to the contributions presented in Section III. All approaches aim to derive knowledge from field constraints."}, {"heading": "V. EVALUATION CRITERIA", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this article, we propose a concept for knowledge-based scenarios for automated vehicles. Ontologies are a representation of knowledge-based systems that are widely used in semantic web applications. Publications in recent years show that ontologies can represent traffic scenes. We adapt the modelling of knowledge and suggest a process that can derive true statements from existing knowledge rather than augment true facts with knowledge.The next steps in our work are to model each level of the five-layer model and derive modelling techniques for the representation of traffic scenarios. Scenes generated should be a basis for a risk analysis and risk assessment in the aFAS project. In order to integrate this knowledge-based approach into the development process of automated vehicles, we need to extend the generated scenes to scenarios that describe a temporal evolution between multiple scenes and the behavior of traffic participants. This will have further influence on the design of ontology and also on the algorithm to derive scenarios from existing knowledge."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We would like to thank our partners from the project consortium consisting of MAN Truck - Bus AG (consortium leader), TRW Automotive GmbH (ZF TRW), WABCO Development GmbH, Robert Bosch Automotive Steering GmbH, Hochschule Karlsruhe, Hessen Mobil - Stra\u00dfen- und Verkehrsmanagement and BASt - Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Stra\u00dfenwesen for their support.
