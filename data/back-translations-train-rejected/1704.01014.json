The supposed problem concerns the state of space objects, data systems, and other SSA data. The first concern is a silo effect that is essentially isolated, information systems being used as a generic term for these systems. Political obstacles aside, there are at least two specific concerns, both of which apply to other data-intensive disciplines. The first concern is that individual IS systems may (i) share of data, volumes of data are inaccessible (ii) and (iiii) different data formats use different data formats, standards, terminologies, and classifications in a common universe to have discourse."}, {"heading": "4.

This is intuitive because the concept (and talk) of deposits brings material things to mind. But deeper ontological analyses yield another possibility. Debris can be modeled as a role that we ascribe to physical objects in orbit, a role played by the object in terms of social conventions, processes, and systems. One could justify this alternative characterization as follow-up systems. Common definitions describe debris as useless or dysfunctional."}, {"heading": "5.2 SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN/REFERENCE ONTOLOGIES FOR ODO", "text": "These ontologies capture general scientific knowledge, including physical laws / principles of nature, the respective discipline. Scientific ontologies act as reference ontologies or models that express knowledge necessary to comment and ontologically describe instance data and ODO assertions. Given the intersection and interlinking of these disciplines, there will be a degree of prescriptions and arbitrariness regarding the limits, scope and content of each ontology. Concepts that resist placement that are inherently vague or have several equally plausible ontological characterizations should be thoroughly conceptual and philosophical analysis. 11"}, {"heading": "ASTRONOMY ONTOLOGIES", "text": "One or more astronomical ontologies should include general terms for astronomical phenomena studied by astronomers. The most prominent astronomical units relevant to ODO are natural celestial bodies, i.e. planets. A broader space situation perception ontology (SSAO) will include classes for more astronomical entities, such as space weather phenomena, asteroids and comets, etc. Existing ontologies include astronomical ontologies (astronomy / science ontology), and the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) ontology of astronomical object types. Together, this set of ontologies includes astronomical objects, scientific units, and so on.

Coordinate systems designed as geometric constructs must be represented in these ontologies. Note that the concept of a data or information unit is not entirely clear and problem-free, but it will be enough to clarify this point. It is also unclear whether geometric units are correctly classified as one type of these units, types of abstracts, cognitive artifacts, or other. Agencies such as NASA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are notable sources of this knowledge. Formal representations of this type of units also exist. IVOA and UMD ontologies, for example, have measurement and unit parts, and NASA's Semantic Web for Earth Environmental Terminology (SWEET) ontologies include a number of unit terms."}, {"heading": "ASTRODYNAMICS STANDARDS ONTOLOGY", "text": "The NORAD Two-Line Element Set (NASA TLE) is the best-known standard format for defining an orbit. Orbital state vectors, on the other hand, are another format used to express the position of an object in orbit; the references (if any) of any data element - presumably the Kepler orbital elements - in the TLE should be determined; for example, orbital inclination as the angle between a reference plane (a geometric construction) and the orbital plane appears to be an angle (an information, mathematical or geometric entity); more generally, it can be characterized as a relation property; for SSA organizations with different formats for the same orbital elements, ontology serves to comment on and classify general astrology.

Instance data containing sensor data of actual space objects should be provided with ODO generic categories to provide formal semantics to the user and the computational system.

CONCLUSION", "text": "By improving our situational awareness of the orbital environment, we are better able to solve the space junk threat and improve space security.
