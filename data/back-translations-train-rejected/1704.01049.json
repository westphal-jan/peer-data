Problem description and modelling", "text": "We are looking at a multi-level warehouse of a production site. Order intake consists of large batches of individual items, which are manually picked by a picking system of pickers to parts in a container and delivered to a few points of issue. The first two levels of the warehouse are easily accessible, while all levels above can only be reached by a lifting device, leading to a higher picking time per item. The items ordered in one batch are correlated with each other, as each batch corresponds to the parts used in one step of the assembly line of the production facility. The difficulty of this SLAP lies in the high number of possible optional features that the customer can choose from when ordering one of the (very few) main products: the number of items required for all options in a main product line is relatively small compared to the number of items corresponding to one or more options. Thus, the correlations between the individual items to be picked are quite complex and cannot be handled by a pure frequency-based algorithm, as suggested in [6]."}, {"heading": "4.

Discussion/Conclusion", "text": "This paper presents a simulated light bulb algorithm to reduce picking times for potentially large quantities of items by combining warehouse allocation optimization in a multi-storey warehouse with implicit s-shape routing heuristics. Our main contribution is a general solution to the storage space problem that is flexible enough to be used in a multi-storey warehouse. While the current algorithm is designed for single-block warehouse plans, expansions in more general warehouse areas can easily be made by adapting formulas (4,3). Remarkably, this algorithm can also be applied to parts of the warehouse without phantom constraints or other unnatural solutions."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "A.E. and C.G. would like to thank the Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft for the partial financing of this project.
