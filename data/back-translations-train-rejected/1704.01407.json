We support this claim by analyzing the recent advances of the field. Regarding integration, we note that the most impactful recent contributions have been made possible through the integration of recent Machine Learning methods (based in particular on Deep Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks) with more traditional ones (e.g. Monte-Carlo tree search, goal babbling exploration or addressable memory systems). Regarding embodiment, we note that the traditional benchmark tasks (e.g. visual classification or board games) are becoming obsolete as state-of-the-art learning algorithms approach or even surpass human performance in most of them, having recently encouraged the development of first-person 3D game platforms embedding realistic physics. Building upon this analysis, we first propose an embodied cognitive architecture integrating heterogenous sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence into a unified framework. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by showing how major contributions of the field can be expressed within the proposed framework. We then claim that benchmarking environments need to reproduce ecologically-valid conditions for bootstrapping the acquisition of increasingly complex cognitive skills through the concept of a cognitive arms race between embodied agents.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 13:26:50 GMT  (733kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01407v1", "Paper submitted to the ICDL-Epirob 2017 conference"], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 08:40:20 GMT  (733kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01407v2", "Paper accepted to the ICDL-Epirob 2017 conference"], ["v3", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 16:27:46 GMT  (741kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01407v3", "Updated version of the paper accepted to the ICDL-Epirob 2017 conference (Lisbon, Portugal)"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper submitted to the ICDL-Epirob 2017 conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA", "authors": ["cl\\'ement moulin-frier", "jordi-ysard puigb\\`o", "xerxes d arsiwalla", "mart\\`i sanchez-fibla", "paul f m j verschure"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01407"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.01407.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Embodied Artificial Intelligence through Distributed Adaptive Control: An Integrated Framework", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9ment Moulin-Frier"], "emails": ["clement.moulinfrier@gmail.com", "santmarti@gmail.com", "jordiysard.puigbo@upf.edu", "x.d.arsiwalla@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be a matter of time before it is so far, until it is so far."}, {"heading": "II.

integration and embodiment. We support this claim by analyzing the recent advances of the field. Regarding integration, we note that the most impactful recent contributions have been made possible through the integration of recent Machine Learning methods (based in particular on Deep Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks) with more traditional ones (e.g. Monte-Carlo tree search, goal babbling exploration or addressable memory systems). Regarding embodiment, we note that the traditional benchmark tasks (e.g. visual classification or board games) are becoming obsolete as state-of-the-art learning algorithms approach or even surpass human performance in most of them, having recently encouraged the development of first-person 3D game platforms embedding realistic physics. Building upon this analysis, we first propose an embodied cognitive architecture integrating heterogenous sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence into a unified framework. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by showing how major contributions of the field can be expressed within the proposed framework. We then claim that benchmarking environments need to reproduce ecologically-valid conditions for bootstrapping the acquisition of increasingly complex cognitive skills through the concept of a cognitive arms race between embodied agents.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2016"}}}
