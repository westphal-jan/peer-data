Traditional classification can lead to poor generalization and high misclassification given few and possibly biased labels. We tackle this problem by analyzing fraudulent behavioral patterns, featurizing users to yield strong discriminative performance, and building algorithms to handle new and multimodal fraud types. First, we set up honeypots, or \"dummy\" social network accounts on which we solicit fake followers (after careful IRB approval). We report the signs of such behaviors, including oddities in local network connectivity, account attributes, and similarities and differences across fraud providers. We discover several types of fraud behaviors, with the possibility of even more. We discuss how to leverage these insights in practice, build strongly performing entropy-based features, and propose OEC (Open-ended Classification), an approach for \"future-proofing\" existing algorithms to account for the complexities of link fraud. Our contributions are (a) observations: we analyze our honeypot fraudster ecosystem and give insights regarding various fraud behaviors, (b) features: we engineer features which give exceptionally strong (&gt;0.95 precision/recall) discriminative power on ground-truth data, and (c) algorithm: we motivate and discuss OEC, which reduces misclassification rate by &gt;18% over baselines and routes practitioner attention to samples at high-risk of misclassification.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 13:39:40 GMT  (9558kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01420v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 06:31:22 GMT  (9558kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01420v2", "affiliation updates"], ["v3", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 13:36:43 GMT  (8047kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01420v3", "\"full\" version of the ICDM2017 short paper, \"The Many Faces of Link Fraud\""]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["neil shah", "hemank lamba", "alex beutel", "christos faloutsos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01420"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.01420.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Many Faces of Link Fraud", "authors": ["Neil Shah", "Hemank Lamba", "Alex Beutel", "Christos Faloutsos"], "emails": ["christos}@cs.cmu.edu,", "alexbeutel@google.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is so that we are able to assert ourselves that we are able to establish ourselves in the world, and that we are able to establish ourselves in the world, \"he said in an interview with the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\""}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "We categorize related work into two categories: underground market studies and approaches to fraud detection.

To identify these services, we used Google search and asked for keywords such as \"buy Twitter followers.\" By combining search results, we obtained a list of websites that claim to provide these services. From the collection of websites on this list, we note that there are several dominant service models - we categorize them into two frameworks: Premium and Freemium. Premium services offer customers multiple periods of follower counting (1K, 5K, 10K, etc.) for different amounts of money and only ask for the customer's Twitter username and a payment method. Freemium services offer both a paid option and premium services, but also offer a free option that does not ask the user for money but instead asks the user to provide their login data to the service."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Instrumentation Details", "text": "Reproducibility: Code available at https: / / goo.gl / qMBWim. We use the REST API to collect data relevant to our operations from Twitter.

Before purchasing fake followers, we run a number of Python scripts that query the API and insert data into a Postgres database: Honeypot account details: Every hour we collect public details for each Honeypot Twitter account, including the number of friends and followers, number of favorites, number of tweets, language, etc. Honeypot account follower IDs: Every 12 hours we collect the list of follower IDs for each Honeypot.

Table 6 shows entropy in bits per service, per attribute for a variety of user attributes. Account attributes include creation year, default profile and profile picture Booleans, favourites count, followers count, friends count, lists count, status count, geolocation enabled boolean, language identifier, protected status Boolean, UTC timezone and a Twitter verification Boolean that matches high-profile, \"famous\" accounts. These attributes have different result spaces. The creation date has 11 possible years (2006-2016) since Twitter was founded in 2006. Booleans have 2 possible results (T, F). We came across 35 different language attributes and 39 UTC time zone settings. In terms of counting functions, we allocate space in 32 containers from 1 to 1 M to cover the wide range of activity grades."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Account Creation", "text": "devumi, twitterboost and fastfollowerz have very little entropy when creating annual figures compared to freemium providers. While both freemium and premium accounts tend to be created more recently (perhaps due to the higher suspension rate of older accounts), premium providers tend to have recently created accounts (> 2014)."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Profile Defaults", "text": "fastfollowerz has much lower entropy in terms of default profile than other providers - we found that > 84% of these accounts had no default profile, while default profiles are actually more common in freemium accounts than not. Surprisingly, fastfollowerz, devumi and twitterboost also have near-zero entropy for the profile picture, compared to the much higher entropy for freemium accounts. We find that premium followers almost always create a custom image, suggesting that the information was invented or stolen by real users. Conversely, default profiles are common in freemium service accounts - this is intuitive, most real users do not fully adjust their profiles."}, {"heading": "3.3.3 Action Counts", "text": "Demumi and twitterboost have much lower entropy for the number of users (favorites, followers, friends, lists and status) compared to freemium providers. \u2212 Fast followers also have lower entropy. \u2212 As Figure 1d shows, there are even more differences between the preferred providers of followers. Figure 1d shows that the number of followers between Twitter (P1 \"smart\") and real followers is disparate and closer to the entropy of real users, as opposed to other premium fraudsters (P2 \"na\u00efve\") who behave robotically. In comparison, freemium followers have a lower number of followers than true follower-follower entropy, which is intuitive as the freemium follower-follower-follower numbers are not independent of each other. Figure 4 shows the number of followers by follower-follower numbers for different types of followers."}, {"heading": "3.3.4 User Settings", "text": "Most of them use the English language setting, have geolocation disabled and do not protect tweets. \"Smart\" is a slightly higher linguistic entropy of 0.06, but we found that all fastfollowerz accounts use either US or British English, indicating a strong premium for English accounts. \"Smart\" tweets the high-language entropy of followers in Figure 1d suggests that one goal is to compare user attributes with the \"na\u00efve\" providers. Considering that Intertwitter also has some verified accounts, we assume that the accounts can be hijacked. \"This is in contrast to frequency providers, which have a much higher frequency of activated geolocation.\""}, {"heading": "4 Assessing Discriminative Power of Entropy Features", "text": "So far, we have highlighted a number of distribution differences between fraudulent and real users. Can we use these differences to discriminate against user behavior? In this section, we evaluate a number of attributes for their discriminatory power in a monitored environment. We classify the constructed entropy functions from Table 6 into the following groups based on characteristics: # Follower, # Friends \u2022 Activity: # Statuses, # Favorites \u2022 Profiles: Default Profile (and Image), Verified, UTC: The unification of all of the above characteristics."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "The analysis in this paper has a number of important implications for fraud detection in practice. We cite these below. Multimodal detection: The use of individual signatures to detect a type of fraud tends to come at the expense of detecting other types of fraud. Thus, clique detection primarily focuses on freemium fraud, while bipartite core detection focuses on premium fraud. Using complementary methods is a promising strategy. Importance of time: Different re-use policies make time granularity an important consideration in graph-based fraud detection. While analysis on a low-granularity chart can reveal a dense fraudulent structure in common re-use systems, it may never do so with low re-use regimes. Higher granularity can be useful in these cases. Deceptive account attributes: Using individual account attributes for label-resistant fraudsters suggests that most of our benefits are actually limited."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "To this end, we set up honeypot accounts on Twitter, purchased fake followers for them from a variety of fraudulent services, and carefully orchestrated a data-scraping process to record their behavior. Specifically, we examined the local network connectivity of fake followers via the egonet and proposed boomerang networks, and the distribution of attributes across profile characteristics and account movements. Our analyses showed that there are several types of link fraud (we found at least two: freemium and premium) with different behaviors in terms of internal and external network connectivity, different attribute homogeneity between followers and account movements, and differences in descriptive word use in Twitter bios. In addition, we found fascinating evidence that service providers have different types of account reuse policies and appear to work together on a number of fronts. In addition, we suggested the use of list characteristics in relation to scammers on a first-order basis."}], "references": [{"title": "What they do in shadows: Twitter underground follower market", "author": ["A.
