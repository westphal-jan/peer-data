Graph-sections of graph-sections are used in theories and algorithms of image-segmentation (s-t-section).

MRF-MAP-ICM is a flexible framework for image multiple partition (not just tumor or or non-tumor). Most BUS image segmentation approaches based on this framework achieve good performance by developing better probability energy and obtaining better initialization. Only obtaining a locally optimal solution is the main deficit of these approaches. Graph sections provide an efficient framework for image bipartitioning and MRF energy global optimization and are the most important factor for making graph-based models popular again in US image segmentation."}, {"heading": "3. Deformable models", "text": "Deformable models (DMs) are curves or surfaces that can move towards the boundary of the object under the influence of forces defined on the curve or surface, using the knowledge of the image. DMs can handle biological structures with significant variability and allow the user to integrate expertise to guide segmentation when needed; hence they have been extensively applied to BUS image segmentation over the last ten years. DMs are proposed by Terzopoulos [37] and then become a popular and active field according to the serpent approach to the flat image proposed by Kass et al. [38]. In general, DMs can be divided into two categories according to the curve or surface representation during deformation: (1) the parametric DMs (PDMs) and (2) the geometric DMs (GDMs).

Depending on the information on the construction of external force in PDMs or velocity function in GDMs, DMs can be divided into edge-based [38, 41, 42, 44, 48] and region-based [47, 49, 66]. Edge-based DMs aim to draw the developing curve to the object boundary by defining the deformation force or speed using the image gradient [42-44], and the models depend on the image flow to stop the curve deformation. Region-based DMs model region characteristics to control curve deformation; by modeling local regional characteristics, region-based models can usually perform better than edge-based models, especially when images have high noise and weak object boundaries."}, {"heading": "3.4 Deformable models for BUS image segmentation", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate until it is able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "3.5 Summary", "text": "26 / 71 GDM's S 79 model the difference between the thermal intensity distribution and the estimated previous distributionSlow; sensitivity to initialization [124], 2012 PDM's S 20 Redefining the edge-based stop function using phase informationSlow [139], 2013 GDM's S 168 Use both local statistics and phase information to define the velocity function; and better address weak boundaries and inhomogeneity problems [148], 2013 GDM's F 861 GDK and solve the problem of homogeneity."}, {"heading": "4.

If th is a constant over the entire image, the method is referred to as global threshold; if th changes over local characteristics, the method is referred to as adaptive / local threshold.

In clinical routine, automatic breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation is very challenging and essential for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Many BUS segmentation approaches have been studied in the last two decades, and have been proved to be effective on private datasets. Currently, the advancement of BUS image segmentation seems to meet its bottleneck. The improvement of the performance is increasingly challenging, and only few new approaches were published in the last several years. It is the time to look at the field by reviewing previous approaches comprehensively and to investigate the future directions. In this paper, we study the basic ideas, theories,pros and cons of the approaches, group them into categories, and extensively review each category in depth by discussing the principles, application issues, and advantages/disadvantages.
