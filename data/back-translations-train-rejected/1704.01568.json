Introduction Although my focus is on deep learning (DL) research, I am finding that more and more frequently I am being asked to help groups without much DL experience who want to try deep learning on their novel (for DL) application. The motivation for this NRL report derives from noticing that much of my advice and guidance is similar for all such groups. Hence, this report discusses the aspects of applying DL that are more universally relevant. While there are several useful sources of advice on best practices for machine learning [1-5], there are differences relevant to DL that this report addresses. Still, I recommend the reader read and become familiar with these references as they contain numerous gems. In addition, there are many sources on best practices on the topic of software engineering and agile methodologies that I assume the reader is already familiar with (e.g., [6, 7]). The closest reference to the material in this report can be found in Chapter 11 of \u201cDeep Learning\u201d [8] on \u201cPractical Methodology\u201d but here I discuss a number of factors and insights not covered in this textbook. You can see below that a deep learning application project is divided into phases. However, in practice you are likely to find it helpful to return to an earlier phase. For example, while finding an analogy in phase 3, you might discover new metrics that you hadn\u2019t considered in phase 1. All of these best practices implicitly include iteratively returning to a phase and continuous improvement as the project proceeds. Phase 1: Getting prepared In this report I assume you are (or have access to) a subject matter expert for your application. You should be familiar with the literature and research for solving the associated problem and know the state-of-the-art solutions and performance levels. I recommend you consider here at the beginning if a deep learning solution is a worthwhile effort. You must consider the performance level of the state-ofthe-art and if it is high, whether it is worthwhile to put in the efforts outlined in this report for an incremental improvement. Don\u2019t jump into deep learning only because it seems like the latest and", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
