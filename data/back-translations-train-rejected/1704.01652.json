At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \\varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 21:03:53 GMT  (2203kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01652v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["moran feldman", "christopher harshaw", "amin karbasi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01652"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.01652.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Greed Is Good: Near-Optimal Submodular Maximization via Greedy Optimization", "authors": ["Moran Feldman", "Christopher Harshaw", "Amin Karbasi"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "\u221a k) -times results in the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called REPEAT-EDGREEDY, to maximize a general submodular function subject to k-independent system constraints.
