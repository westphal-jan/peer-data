In this paper, we propose two machine learning methods for automatic measurement of pre-aspiration duration: feedforward neural network, which works at the frame level; and structured prediction model, which relies on manually designed feature functions, and works at the segment level. The input for both algorithms is a speech signal of an arbitrary length containing a single obstruent, and the output is a pair of times which constitutes the pre-aspiration boundaries. We train both models on a set of manually annotated examples. Results suggest that the structured model is superior to the frame-based model as it yields higher accuracy in predicting the boundaries and generalizes to new speakers and new languages. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our structured prediction algorithm by replicating linguistic analysis of pre-aspiration in Aberystwyth English with high correlation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 21:10:07 GMT  (858kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01653v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 28 May 2017 18:56:58 GMT  (859kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01653v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 09:47:26 GMT  (859kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01653v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yaniv sheena", "m\\'i\\v{s}a hejn\\'a", "yossi adi", "joseph keshet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01653"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.01653.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Automatic Measurement of Pre-aspiration", "authors": ["Yaniv Sheena", "M\u0131\u0301\u0161a Hejn\u00e1", "Yossi Adi", "Joseph Keshet"], "emails": ["yaniv.sheena@live.biu.ac.il,", "misa.hejna@cc.au.dk,", "jkeshet@cs.biu.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "It is a time of (primarily) glottal friction that is automatically found in the sequences of sonorants and phonetically voiceless obstacles prior to the publication of the consonant, e.g. in Welsh English kit / khIhts /, miss / mIhs /, milk / mIl \u02da kh /, etc. Al-although preaspiration was previously considered rare [1,2], with advances in recording technology it has recently been reported that it occurs in more and more languages and varieties of it [3-15]. Recent studies on preaspiration have shown that the phenomenon is highly individual [1, 7, 16] sensitive to sex / sex [17] and can be influenced by age [5, 7] and the first language of the speaker [17]. Most of the work on preaspiration is based on subjective, labor-intensive manual annotations."}, {"heading": "2. Problem Setting", "text": "In the context of a typical phonological study, the aim of an automatic measurement algorithm for measuring pre-aspiration is to predict as accurately as possible the beginning and compensation time of pre-aspiration. In this paper, we assume that the acoustic signal contains exactly one encoded obstacle within a word and that the signal begins before the expected pre-aspiration, i.e. during the preceding phoneme. We turn to the formal description of the problem. Throughout the paper, scalars with Latin lowercase letters, e.g. x, and vectors with bold face letters, e.g. x, are denoted. A sequence of elements is denoted with an x-bar and their length is denoted as a | x-value. The acoustic input is denoted as a sequence of feature vectors, x-value = (x1, xT), with each vector, xt, being a two-dimensional vector representing the acoustic content of pre-time."}, {"heading": "3. Learning Apparatus", "text": "In this section we describe how we learn the prediction function from a series of training examples. We designate the training set ofar Xiv: 170 4.01 653v 3 [cs.C L] 15 Jun 2017m Examples by S = {(x-i, tis, tie) mi = 1, the i-th example being composed of a sequence of acoustic features x-i with an insertion and offset pair (tis, tie). Let us denote the predicted prediction and offset pair by (t-s, t-e), namely (t-e, t-e) = f\u03b8 (x-i), denoting the set of parameters of the prediction function f. To evaluate the quality of the prediction function, we use a task-loss function by (t-ts, t-e), (t-s) = f\u03b8 (x-e), denoting the set of parameters of the prediction function f."}, {"heading": "3.1. Acoustic features", "text": "The first four characteristics relate to the total energy (Etotal), the energy between 50-1000 Hz (Elow), the energy above 3000 Hz (Ehigh) and the Viennese entropy (Hwiener) - all are based on the short-term Fourier transformation (STFT), which is recorded every 1 ms with a 5 ms hamming window. The fifth characteristic, Pmax, is the maximum of the power spectrum calculated in a region from 6 ms before to 18 ms after the image center. The sixth characteristic (Rl) is the pitch of the signal using a real-time pitch detector [27]. The seventh characteristic is the 0 / 1 output of a segment in the middle of a segment (PRAM 5)."}, {"heading": "3.2. Frame-based model", "text": "To take advantage of the local time context of each timeframe, we use an advanced neural network. We have tried several network architectures and decided on the one that works best based on a validation set. The network consists of an input layer of 40 units (remember we extract D = 8 features per frame and have 5 consecutive frames), a hidden layer of 40 units with ReLU activation and a drop-out rate of 0.3, and an output unit followed by a sigmoid. The network has been trained to minimize the loss of binary cross entropy using the flow optimization algorithm."}, {"heading": "3.3. Structured model", "text": "The second algorithm uses the input as a whole segment, so we can introduce function charts such as typical pre-aspiration duration, mean energy during assumed pre-aspiration compared to mean energy before or after pre-aspiration. Similar to the previous work in structured prediction [29, 30], function f is constructed from a predefined set of N attribute cards. (t) The function is a linear predictor of the following form (t, t) = arg max. (t) Ni = 1, each of the form sp. (t, t) w \u2212 b, each of the form sp. (x, t), where we have used vector notation for the attribute cards. (.) The function is a linear predictor of the following form (t, t). This vector-weighted function is used to define the variable length of the input speech together with a presupposed pair to an abstract vector in space."}, {"heading": "3.4. Feature maps for the structured model", "text": "Character maps are based on local differences, cumulative mean and maximum over sub-set characteristics in relation to the preaspiration limits. They were selected on the basis of a manual inspection of values and trends of characteristics in intervals close to ts and te and reflect knowledge of the problem of preaspiration measurement, which in our case is based on [7]. As an example of such a characteristic map, we consider the observation that if aspiration is immediately followed by a quiet interval in connection with plosives, we expect that high frequencies (above 3000 Hz) decrease compared to the interval of preaspiration, which has a high energy presence at these frequencies. To express this observation, we define characteristic maps showing the differences between the mean values of Ehigh and Hwiener over a pre-aspiration interval (te, te + 50) and the pre-aspiration interval (maximum calculated interval) as a change in a millimetre, which is a rule that another important observation arises after a change in a millimetre."}, {"heading": "4. Data Set", "text": "The data consists of 5,297 examples of 16 English speakers from the town of Aberystwyth in Mid Wales. All speakers were born and raised in the town and speak Welsh L1. The featured speakers are 10 women and 6 men and their age range ranges from 22-91 years to allow for preliminary generational comparisons. The data itself consisted of a list of words that the participants read; each word contained a sequence of a vowel and a post-tonic plosive. Each word was read once isolated and twice in a set of images. For more details on the segmental and prosodic properties of the tokens in terms of aspects such as vowel height, location and manner of articulation of the plosive, stress and foot position see [7]. The recordings were made using an H4 zoom mobile phone recorder (sampled at 44.1 kHz) in conjunction with the AKG C520 head-mounted microphone that was attached to the speaker's head and ensured a constant distance from the speaker's mouth."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "We evaluated the performance of our algorithms using three main methods: First, we compared the predictions of the frame-based algorithm and the structured algorithm with the manual annotations; then we tested how the structured prediction algorithm, which was superior to the frame-based algorithm, generalized new speakers and languages; finally, we replicated a linguistic study of the model predictions and compared them with the results we had obtained from the manually annotated data. All experiments in this section are based on models trained with search windows of 50 ms before the marked left limit (ts) and 60 ms after the right limit (te), testing multiple window sizes and the effects were insignificant."}, {"heading": "5.1. Models performance", "text": "We evaluated both algorithms based on the corpus described in the previous section using 5-fold cross-validation. For each fold, 15% of the data served as a validation set. We regulated both algorithms by stopping at an early stage. For the frame-based algorithm, we compensated the data by randomly dropping negative examples, since the amount of such examples was significantly greater than the amount of positive examples. For the structured model, we used C = 50, which was selected on the basis of a validation group, and where the task loss was 2 ms.We compared the models by comparing the percentage of examples in the test set with automatic / manual differences that were less than a time tolerance, using tolerances of 5, 10, 15 and 20 ms. We also report the average error in predicting deployment and offset. The results are given in Table 2. The results should read as follows: The percentage of the correctly predicted prediction was within a prediction of 43.3% of a prediction algorithm."}, {"heading": "5.2. Generalization", "text": "To test our generalisation of the algorithm on the basis of data generated from different sources, we conducted several experiments. Firstly, we conducted Leave-one-speaker-out (LOSO) with the 16 speakers of Aberystwyth English, i.e. the utterances of each speaker were individually tested using a structured model trained by the other speakers. The averaged results are summarised in the first row of Table 4. Note that the results are very similar to the results in the second row of Table 2, where the data was randomly divided by 5-fold cross-validation. Next, we evaluated our structured algorithm using a data set consisting of 607 Welsh language intervals (16 speakers from Bethesda, North Wales). The performance of the algorithm on the Welsh corpus using 4-fold cross-validation was summarised in the second row of Table 4. Our aim was to compare the performance of the structured algorithm, which was trained on one language with another."}, {"heading": "5.3.

Discussion", "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop an automatic tool for measuring pre-aspiration. We have shown that the structured algorithm outperforms the frame-based neural network algorithm. Furthermore, we have reproduced the results of a linguistic analysis based on pre-aspiration, using only the predictions of our structured algorithm. Future work may include extending the use of the algorithm to the rubbing context, automatically detecting if there is pre-aspiration at a certain interval, and applying the methods presented to lower-quality data."}, {"heading": "7.

We propose two machine learning methods for automatic measurement of pre-aspiration duration: a feedforward neural network, which works at the frame level; and a structured prediction model, which relies on manually designed feature functions, and works at the segment level. The input for both algorithms is a speech signal of an arbitrary length containing a single obstruent, and the output is a pair of times which constitutes the pre-aspiration boundaries. We train both models on a set of manually annotated examples. Results suggest that the structured model is superior to the frame-based model as it yields higher accuracy in predicting the boundaries and generalizes to new speakers and new languages. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our structured prediction algorithm by replicating linguistic analysis of pre-aspiration in Aberystwyth English with high correlation.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
