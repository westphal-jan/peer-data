Let us define a finite set of elements called elementary events, each subset of which is a composite event or hypothesis. A basic probability mapping (bpa) function is any function m: 2B [0, 1] such as that designated as elementary events. (The subset of which is called the framework of distinction.

We would like to obtain such a collection of evidence stating that Pl3 = Pl1 Pl 2 would have the semantics that under this interpretation Pl3 (A) is the maximum probability that an element from the series of events A occurs, since the evidence is provided to Pl1, Pl2 among the least contradictory proofs. Let us study this assumption in detail. First, we must say what we mean by independent proofs."}, {"heading": "4 Examples", "text": "Consider the evidence in Tables 1, 2, 3. Compare Tables 4 and 6With this and other experiments, we clearly see the tendency of the Dempster rule to shift mass downwards to singleton propositions, while the new rule is much more cautious here and does not actually introduce a sense of certainty where it is not justified."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced a new daylight saving time operator to combine independent evidence that provides a clear probable definition of the plausibility function preserved under this combination rule. We have also provided several toy examples to give an impression of the results the new operator delivers. Although the strict theoretical proof of properties such as cumulativity, associativity is yet to be provided, the calculations for test examples show that the properties really hold. It is also clear from the examples that the new rule differs from the empster rule of evidence combination.
