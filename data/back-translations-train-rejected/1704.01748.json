Another advantage of radiological reports is that, even if written in free text, they are usually well structured. (3) Much work has been done on text mining biomedical texts, including health records (2), but although radiological reports are usually written in the radiologist's native language, text mining tools are mostly developed for English. (3) An information extraction system for English reports has been created that depends on RadLex (4), a radiology terminology lexicon that is freely available in English."}, {"heading": "Description", "text": "The flow of the application goes like this: the user loads a text file with radiology text into the application (Figure 1), and if the text is available in a non-English language, it is sent to Unbabel's translation services 1, which combine human translation with machine translation. Currently, the application supports five languages beyond English, which are supported by the Unbabel API. In this prototype, only machine translation is used for demonstration purposes. In a real scenario, human translation could also be used for more reliable results. So, the text is sent to the translation and after a while (about 2 minutes to simulate a real human and machine translation) the translation is finished. Afterwards, the translated text is sent to BioPortal2 annotation services. Afterwards, it is possible to examine the annotations in the translated text and after a while (about 2 minutes to simulate a real human and machine translation) find the annotation of the text in the translated text (the annotation of the text was inspired by a similar project name)."}, {"heading": "1 https://unbabel.com/", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2 http://bioportal.bioontology.org/annotator", "text": "3 http: / / www.celeryproject.org / 4 http: / / www.celeryproject.org /"}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The idea is that this application can be used to launch other, more useful applications.
