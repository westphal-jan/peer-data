The goals behind these initiatives range from government transparency to promoting civic engagement in government decisions. Typically, dissemination efforts focus on the development and publication of online data portals. Many of these portals, for example, are based on CKAN4, which acts as a comprehensive data repository with data from a variety of different government agencies due to technological limitations. Often, CKAN-hosted datasets transfer data empirically through city sensors. Due to technological limitations, the data is often consolidated into datasets. Although this approach is practical for data producers, it often poses an obstacle for data consumers. Much work is done in integrating and publishing urban datasets. QuerioCity [11] describes a linked data platform for publishing, searching for and linking urban data from static datasets or streams from sensors used."}, {"heading": "2.2 Semantic sensor network and Observational data", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country."}, {"heading": "3 A streamlined process to collect and publish data for Smart Cities", "text": "Our approach is based on HASNetO ontology. HASNetO is primarily designed to be used in scientific environments by scientists conducting observation and data collection activities in areas of interest, such as physical, chemical, biological, social or cultural characteristics. Although HASNetO is comprehensive enough to provide what scientists need to track their activities, HASNetO faces challenges in dealing with data collected in large, complex environments with a broad user base, such as urban environments. One of these challenges is that the data collected may not only be used by the city administration or people involved in the related measurements (people who know something about the data at any level), but above all by citizens who generally have little to no knowledge of the collection environment and data collected. For example, the accuracy or resolution of an instrument used for data collection (people who know something about the data at any level), but above all by citizens who generally have little to no knowledge of the collection environment and data collected."}, {"heading": "3.1 HASNetO-SC", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "3.2 Contextualized Comma Separated Values", "text": "asD \"i, so asgt it on,\" he says. \"asD\" asD \"n\" i, asds asds asd asd asd. \"asD\" i \"n,\" so asd asd asd \"a.\" S \"D\" \"i\" n, a \"s asd,\" a \"i.\" D \"iW\" i \"n,\" a \"i.\" \"D\" \"i\" s, \"\" a \"s.\" \"\" D \"i\" c \"h,\" \"a\". \"\" \"D\" \"i\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" a \"s\", \"\" \"\" \"a\" s \",\" a \"\" a \"s,\" \"\" a \"s,\" \"\" \"a\" s, \"\" \"\" a \"s,\" \"\" \"\" \"a\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\", \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\"."}, {"heading": "3.3 Domain ontology", "text": "An observation from a scientific point of view is defined as the act of observing the ownership of a company and obtaining a measurement value. Measurements are expressed by a certain standard (or unit of measurement). To properly comment on measurements, we need a hierarchy of stakeholders with relevant characteristics, a hierarchy of characteristics with relevant characteristics, and a hierarchy of standards that can be used in measurements. OBOE ontology already provides a hierarchy of a number of units, characteristics, and units of measurement, although it focuses on ecological studies. Domain ontology allows for a deep linkage of the collected data with its metadata. For cities, Section 4 discusses our initial approach to this ontology in the context of a public transportation system."}, {"heading": "4 Use case: Fortaleza urban transportation system", "text": "Our primary use cases focus on the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. The city of Fortaleza is the capital of the state of Ceara in northeastern Brazil, with about 2.5 million inhabitants. Recently, the city government launched its Smart City program called \"Fortaleza Inteligente.\" This project, coordinated by the Fortaleza Foundation for Science, Technology and Innovation (CITINOVA), has as one of its main components the city's open data portal, which contains a wealth of different data sets from different public segments. We are working with CITINOVA to leverage our approach in the city's open data portal, in particular to present data on the urban mobility segment. The first initiative was the modeling of public transport data. Fortaleza has used GPS instruments in each of its running buses that are capable of transmitting the current geographical position of the bus. GPS data is transmitted to a central server, where it is stored in data sets that follow ad-hoc logic."}, {"heading": "4.1 Building the Semantic Sensor Network", "text": "To develop a concept, we gathered three sets of data from the Fortaleza Dados Abertos7 portal relating to the public transport system: - Bus checkpoints: A list of all bus checkpoints in the city. - Each checkpoint consists of its code, a name, a lat / long position and a radius around that point / long to indicate the checkpoint it covers. - Bus companies: A list of all bus companies that have a contract with the City Hall to provide this public service. Each company has a company ID, a name and other information.7 http: / dados.fortaleza.gov.br- Bus fleet: A list of all buses operating in the city. - Each bus has an ID, a manufacturer it belongs to, and other information, including plates, serial numbers and so on. \u2212 GPS bus information for 2015 / 02: A report with a specific bus that enters a checkpoint and leaves a checkpoint."}, {"heading": "4.2 Annotating the CSV dataset", "text": "s, \"he says,\" it is as if it is a reactionary project that is capable of realizing itself. \""}, {"heading": "4.3 CCSV parsing and indexing", "text": "To complete the connection between data and metadata previously described, including full integration with the semantic sensor network, we have used an instance of Apache SOLR8 to index and store data and metadata. SOLR is a NoSQL database capable of indexing documents in a number of different formats, including CSV, XML, and JSON. SOLR document collections should contain field definitions, including data types, for content to be indexed and stored. Within SOLR, we have created two collections: (i) a metadata collection for storing the semantic sensor network, domain ontology, and provision of metadata, and (ii) a metadata collection for storing the data itself. Metadata collection is essentially a threefold business in which the Turtle sensor networks have been loaded and the domains described."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "This work has been motivated by the challenges of understanding, using and integrating data from dataset portals based on current monitoring and publishing approaches. One issue we have introduced is the boundary of a dataset as a natural context boundary versus a technologically convenient boundary. Our use case for the public transport system in Fortaleza has shown that our approach allows users to access not only the metadata of the sensor network, but also metadata-driven navigation of the data. This combination, we believe, will help bypass many of the challenges of understanding, using and integrating data, even in situations where datasets have different and potentially arbitrary boundaries, and also in situations where metadata is limited. In future work, we will articulate and implement additional use cases. We are also working on closer integration with the contents of the real-time sensor network in order to expand it through our metadata scheme and thus further evaluate our HASO concept."}], "references": [{"title": "The SSN ontology of the W3c semantic sensor network incubator group", "author": ["M.
