Many of those efforts resulted in one or more high-quality ontologies that describe some aspects of scientific measurements, but not in a comprehensive and coherently integrated manner. For instance, we note that many of these high-quality ontologies are not properly aligned, and more challenging, that they have different and often conflicting concepts and approaches for encoding knowledge about empirical measurements. As a result of this lack of an integrated view, it is often challenging for scientists to determine whether any two scientific measurements were taken in semantically compatible manners, thus making it difficult to decide whether measurements should be analyzed in combination or not. In this paper, we present the Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology that is a comprehensive alignment and integration of a sensing infrastructure ontology and a provenance ontology.

The three faces shown in Fig. 1 represent human roles (or roles only) in a data collection scenario. The role of the scientist is associated with a role of the technician representing the fact that scientists interact with technicians to communicate their needs for setting up and maintaining sensor networks."}, {"heading": "3 Knowledge Behind Measurement Data", "text": "Figure 1 contains ten diamonds that represent knowledge associated with typical data collection scenarios, and the knowledge of these diamonds described in this section is often collected and recorded as metadata for empirical data. One of the assumptions behind such collection is that the metadata collected allows for an understanding of the data without the need for an explanation from scientists directly involved in data collection. There are four categories of diamonds, each of which is represented by the number within the diamonds. Below, we describe each of these four categories of diamonds."}, {"heading": "3.1 Available Measurement Infrastructure", "text": "In Figure 1, diamond category \"1\" represents knowledge of available measurement infrastructure. Scientists conceptually understand the configuration and capabilities of measurement infrastructure, including the instruments and detectors available to them, on which platforms these instruments can or will be deployed, where stationary platforms stand, which paths mobile platforms take, and which physical, chemical, biological, and sociological properties the sensors can measure. Assuming that knowledge of instruments and sensor networks can influence empirical understanding of data, scientists are expected to share their knowledge of measurement infrastructure, for example by encoding the metadata of the measurement data."}, {"heading": "3.2 Calibrations, Configurations and Deployments of Instruments and Detectors", "text": "In Figure 1, diamond category \"2\" represents knowledge of a wide range of human interventions that can affect the quality of measurement data. Knowledge of measurement infrastructure is far from sufficient to explain data generated by instruments in such infrastructures. For example, there are many factors / events that can affect the way measurements are carried out that do not feed into knowledge of the measurement infrastructure itself. If scientists operate scientific instruments in isolation, the importance of documenting the functioning of the instruments becomes evident. More difficult is the process of explaining human interventions in sensor networks, which is often considered an automated infrastructure for collecting scientific data. For example, a poorly used instrument, such as an instrument that is not properly attached to the surface of the deployment platform, may produce measurements that are by a fixed amount or worse, which are unable to perform measurements, for example, because the chord supplying the instrument with electricity is not properly connected."}, {"heading": "3.3 Scientific Annotations of Measurements", "text": "In Figure 1, diamond category \"3\" represents knowledge of what has been measured and how the measurement has been presented in units. If measurements are made, these are measurements of physical, chemical, biological, cultural and social characteristics of so-called stakeholders. For example, if we use air as an interest group, we can say that air temperature is a physical property of air and that the CO2 concentration of air is a chemical property of the same stakeholder group. To understand the data, it is important to know what characteristics are measured, e.g. temperature and CO2 concentration, and what stakeholders are behind these characteristics, e.g. air. In addition, it is important to understand the unit used for the measurements and the semantic context (e.g. air is \"outside air\" as opposed to air within a room, laboratory or protective room), which can, for example, influence the actual measurement of both air temperature and air concentration of CO2."}, {"heading": "3.4 Provenance of Sensor Network Activities", "text": "In Figure 1, diamond category \"4\" stands for knowledge of the origin of both human intervention and each measurement. For each measurement, it is important to know when and where the measurement was performed. What combination of sensor devices was used to support the measurement? Were the sensor devices provided with any configuration parameters that enabled them to operate as they were operating at the time of the measurement?"}, {"heading": "4 HASNetO: The Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology", "text": "HASNetO aims to provide the concepts and vocabulary needed to encode the metadata of empirical data as described in Section 3. HASNetO is based on three ontologies that have been integrated and expanded under the single name HASNetO: The Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) [10], the Virtual Solar Terrestrial Observatory (VSTO) 4 [6] and the World Wide Web's Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) [9]."}, {"heading": "4.1 Encoding Knowledge about Sensor Networks and Individual Instruments", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have set themselves."}, {"heading": "4.2 Encoding Knowledge about Measurements", "text": "Imagine two sets of \"air temperature\" data coming from a common weather station thermometer and representing the readings with the help of Celsius. These measurements could include different hardware and software configurations or calibrations for the platform and the object under observation - in this case, the weather station and the thermometer, making the measurements still difficult to compare or use in combination. For example, the actual temperature was calibrated in the range [-10o, 20o] when the actual temperature is in the operating range. On another use of the thermometer, it was still calibrated in the range [0o, 20o] even though the actual temperature was in the range."}, {"heading": "4.3 Encoding Knowledge about Human Interventions", "text": "In fact, in terms of provenance, we use all the time we need to support scientific activities; for example, people are often heavily involved in technical activities, such as platform maintenance, object calibration, and problem solving."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Systematic Evaluation of HASNetO by Scientists", "text": "One of the strengths of HASNetO is the fact that OBOE, PROV and VSTO are mature, community-developed ontologies. Thus, OBOE was initiated by an NSF-funded project and developed through a series of funded research projects. PROV is a recommended W3C standard supported by academic organizations and industry. VSTOI is a by-product of the ontology of VSTO [6], which was funded by NSF and NASA and has an impact on the development of Woods Hole's BCO-DMO ontology, which is currently used by a large oceanographic community. HASNetO's ontology can be considered suitable for managing empirical scientific data when the final query and browsing capabilities of a HASNetO-based infrastructure are considered useful by a community of scientists dedicated to some challenges of data management described in terms of applications."}, {"heading": "6.2 Future Work", "text": "Human-Aware Science Ontologies (HAScO) are a family of ontologies. HAScO itself is a high-level ontology that describes scientific activities and supports technical activities. Within HAScO, data collections are defined as technical activities in support of empirical and simulated data. HASNetO is the HAScO ontology that provides a vocabulary for coding knowledge of empirical data collection. An overarching goal (and challenge) for HAScO is to provide a vocabulary small enough for domain researchers to use comfortably, but still rich enough to explain complex relationships involved in the combination of empirical and computational scientific activities."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "The Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology (HASNetO) has been established as an integrated and comprehensive vocabulary for the coding of knowledge related to scientific measurements and their derived empirical data. HASNetO addresses and resolves conflicts arising from the integration of three community-developed and community-maintained ontologies for observation, sensing and provenance. Contributions include the identification of appropriate covering ontologies, alignment between them, gap analysis and gap filling. A key gap that HASNetO has filled relates to the provision of terms for modeling human interventions related to empirical activities. Sensor use and data collection are examples of such human interventions. The precise interpretation of the observation concept from OBOE ontology and its relevance to data collection has been highlighted with the creation of a HASNetO concept for collecting data under the name."}], "references": [{"title": "Evolving the bco-dmo search interface-experience with semantic and smart search", "author": ["C.
