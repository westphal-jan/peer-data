RELATED WORK", "text": "Research into health care and epidemic control has increasingly benefited from satellite technologies and artificial intelligence applications in recent years [12], [13], [14]. Much work has been done to predict or map the risk of future disease outbreaks, which can prove crucial, especially for those in remote areas [15]. Access to relevant data for experiments is critical for conducting high-quality research, which we can then use to compare disease detection and prediction methods [17]. The fields of data mining and machine learning using sparse data have yielded many different solutions, including methods to improve classification performance and accurately label classes [18]. Semi-supervised learning methods for data labeling are becoming increasingly complex and can yield promising results when we use a sparse sample of data."}, {"heading": "III. METHODS AND MATERIALS", "text": "The following section describes in detail the data set information used in experiments for this work and describes how the proposed applications are applied to the data. By experimenting with the confidence and passive thresholds, we can assess the optimal level at which each data set can work in terms of labeling and SD classification of the data. Pseudo-code for the LTA and STA algorithms used in ITEA can be seen in algorithm 1: where L is the set of labeled instances, U is the set of blank instances, l is a labeled instance, and u is an unlabeled instance. We then have n as the number of iterations without labeled instance, \u03b3 is the confidence threshold for classifiers, and \u03c6 is the number of passive iterations that are allowed without labeling occurring before the process is finished."}, {"heading": "A. Experimental Data", "text": "The Dataset: we have access to the number of instances (180) due to the time and resources required to carry out the field survey.: The common attributes are as follows: Tasselled Cap Brightness (TCB), Tasselled Cap Greenness (TCG), Tasselled Cap Wetness (TCW), Modified Normence Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalised Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI). By using this limited dataset and these attributes, we can identify the extent to which we are using high precision algorithm 1: Procedure LTA (L, U, U l), Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, Regulation, etc."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "This year, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "C. Cumulative Training Approach ITSVM Results", "text": "In contrast to the 3-point classification scale in Table I, we can find that labelling success is much rarer on the 5-point scale. As can be seen in Table V, there is only one data combination capable of identifying all cases at this confidence threshold, namely the combination of 2003 / 05. This is compared to the 3-point classification in Table I, which provides for five complete labelling of all cases. These results were to be expected taking into account the additional classes that are possible for labelling. In addition to the experiments carried out on both the 3-point and 5-point labelling scale, we analysed the effect of the ITSVM labelling method on our previous method of a cumulative training approach, or CTA, which combines multi-year training data for testing on individual years. In this case, we applied our CTA to both components of the 3-point and 5-point categorisation scale."}, {"heading": "3 CATEGORY SD", "text": "The results in Table V were recorded on the basis of data divided into 5 categories: very low, low, medium, high and very high SD."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "Analysis of the individual charts and tables in this paper indicates that labeling and classification methods performed poorly in 2007 and 2008 compared to the alternating years of data, such as 2003 and 2005. We believe this is due to the adverse weather conditions and climate problems that occur during these recorded years and have a strong impact on the study area of epidemic diseases for SD and prevalence [24]. Characteristic of these weather conditions is that we had partial complete data in 2007 and, as a result, a negative correlation in 2008. The effects of adverse or extreme weather conditions on our prediction methods are the subject of further consideration [26]. We will conduct further research on how to approach the changes in environmental characteristics resulting from these conditions, as they will represent a future problem. Satellite images may be impaired in the application of image extraction in adverse weather conditions, and therefore this problem is one that we must address continuously."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we presented our novel ITSVM approach, which provides an incremental semi-monitored labeling and classification method for our epidemic disease vector problem. ITSVM's next evolution, which is the novel ITEA approach, provides the paradigms LTA and STA, in which we can set parameters for labeling and classification to a selected level of confidence with a variety of basic classifiers. Comparing ITSVM with the standard SVM approach, we have seen a quarter of all cases in our collective dataset that have been improved in terms of classification accuracy, and this, together with the many identical levels of accuracy, makes ITSVM a viable option used in classifying this type of data for schistosomiasis classification and predictive purposes. ITEA methods have shown that they are competitive when it comes to label SD data with LTA."}, {"heading": "VII.
