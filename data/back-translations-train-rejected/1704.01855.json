We propose an architecture, called Semantic Maps (SeMaps), for assisting the authoring and hosting of applications in which the maps combine the aggregation of a Geographic Information System and crowd-generated content (called here crowd maps). In these systems, the digital map works as a blackboard for accommodating stories told by people about events they want to share with others typically participating in their social networks. SeMaps offers an environment for the creation and maintenance of sites based on crowd maps with the possibility for the user to characterize semantically that which s/he intends to mark on the map. The designer of a crowd map, by informing a linguistic expression that designates what has to be marked on the maps, is guided in a process that aims to associate a concept from a common-sense base to this linguistic expression. Thus, the crowd maps start to have dominion over common-sense inferential relations that define the meaning of the marker, and are able to make inferences about the network of linked data. This makes it possible to generate maps that have the power to perform inferences and access external sources (such as DBpedia) that constitute information that is useful and appropriate to the context of the map. In this paper we describe the architecture of SeMaps and how it was applied in a crowd map authoring tool.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 14:22:56 GMT  (402kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01855v1", "In Advances in Artificial Intelligence - SBIA 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "In Advances in Artificial Intelligence - SBIA 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["henrique santos", "vasco furtado"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01855"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.01855.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "A Service-Oriented Architecture for Assisting the Authoring of Semantic Crowd Maps", "authors": ["Henrique Santos", "Vasco Furtado"], "emails": ["hensantos@gmail.com;", "vasco@unifor.br"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "On the contrary, there has been an explosion of interest in the use of the Internet, which is thriving on a daily basis."}, {"heading": "2 Providing Semantics to Crowd Maps", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "3.1 Semantic Characterization Module", "text": "The semantic characterization module includes the services with which the user designer can define the semantic value that he wants to mark on the map (the marker) based on common sense. In short, by informing a linguistic expression that designates the marker, the user designer is guided in a process that aims to link a concept from the common sense basis to the linguistic expression that designates the marker. Thus, the map begins to gain supremacy over common sense. Assigning a concept to a marker is an iterative process that defines the meaning of the marker and is able to draw conclusions about the network of associated data.

This search is based on the semantic characterization performed in the module described in 3.1. The searchLODForConcept method of the LOD WS receives a concept that represents a marker as input and returns a list of URIs that describe resources related to the concept. Usually, the algorithms that implement this search also use InferenceNet. An example of this was described in [14]. URIs returned by the method can be used in different ways, for example as a widget or drawn directly on the map. Due to space constraints, the description of the web service in WSDL has been omitted."}, {"heading": "3.3 D2R Endpoint", "text": "This is not only a matter of time, but also of the way we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we live, how we behave, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we conduct, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we behave, how we, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we behave, how we live, how we behave, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we behave, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we live, how we"}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "The production of linked open data is a growing trend on the Web. Thus, the number of tools for creating semantic content on the Web is increasing. Among these tools are those that export existing data without semantics, such as Drupal [16]. LinkedGeoData [17] is a project that aims at processing and displaying RDF data, partly derived from the relative schema of OpenStreetMap and WGS84. Furthermore, the project aims to enable the binding of OSM with other foundations of LOD. LinkedGeoData developed an ontology that was partly derived from the relative schema."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we propose the concept of the semantic crowd map, in which the process of participation and interaction always takes place in relation to a space indicated on a digital map and the semantics of the marker is provided by the services of SeMaps. We describe a platform for creating semantic crowd maps, which provides an environment for the creation and maintenance of pages based on Crowd Maps. We try to provide the lack of platforms for the development of applications by non-specialized users, where semantic data is automatically generated and used by these applications. SeMaps allows a user to create a crowd map, this by describing the concept of what he wants to mark on the map. Therefore, the maps produced by SeMaps have the power to draw conclusions and access to external sources that represent useful information appropriate to the context of the map. This semantic characterization of the marker has a reasonable basis in Portuguese and English. SeMaps have the power to draw conclusions and access to external sources that are useful information appropriate to the context of the map. This semantic characterization of the marker has a reasonable basis in Portuguese and English. SeMaps have the integration of Wikimaps before they are shown on the crowd maps, before they are shown on WikiMaps."}, {"heading": "7 References", "text": "1.
