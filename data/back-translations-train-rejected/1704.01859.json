THE ANT COLONY SYSTEM", "text": "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a nature-inspired metaheuristics that follows the metaphor of real ants that manage to find the shortest paths between their nest and food sources. In the case of ACO, each artificial ant, henceforth referred to as an \"ant,\" constructs solutions in a probable manner by adding iterative components until a complete solution to the problem is found. In constructing a solution, an ant is influenced by two factors: 1) pheromone pathways that are dynamically updated during runtime and reflect the ant's acquired search experience, and 2) heuristic information, which is a static value, depending on the problem. The algorithm presented in this study is based on the ant colony system (ACS) [17], which is a successor to the ant system (AS) [18]. AS is the first ACO algorithm to be proposed in the literature, and the following solution for the PRP was originally developed by the PRP."}, {"heading": "V. THE ALGORITHM INVESTIGATED FOR DVRPTW", "text": "This section describes our approach to the DVRPTW problem, which is based on the metaheuristic approach of the ant colony system outlined in Section IV. To address the dynamics of the problem, we have adopted in our algorithm the time intersection and node connection approach of the MACSDVRPTW ant Solver introduced in [14]. Accordingly, a working day of twd seconds is divided equally into nts time intersections, calculating the length of one time intersection (tts) as: tts = twd / nts. Thus, the initial DVRPTW problem is divided into nts static problems, which are solved one after the other. In this context, we introduce the concept of the current problem configuration, which designates one of these static problems, defined by the subset of available nodes (customer requirements). We will use Sbest to designate the currently optimal solution, which is the best workable solution, each of which is the previously known problem being merged, each of which is referred to as the next part of the problem."}, {"heading": "A. The planner", "text": "Prior to the start of the working day, an initial workable solution (in terms of capacity, window and arrival time of the vehicle at the depot) is defined, which is built with the time-based nearest heuristic execution introduced in [19]. The time-based nearest neighbor heuristic is a sequential tour building algorithm that takes into account both the geographical and temporal proximity of the customers. This initial solution defines the preliminary tours for the vehicles, taking into account only one priori node known in the system from the outset. First, a vehicle starts its tour from the depot, then iteratively adds the next (in terms of a metric m) unvisited customer, which is guided relative to the last customer on that tour, while remaining feasible. The metric mij, which defines the proximity between i, the last customer on the current emerging tour, and j, the speakers report to each unrouted customer."}, {"heading": "B.

Parameters setup", "text": "In order to allow a fair comparison of the two examined algorithms DVRPTW-ACS and MACS-DVRPTW, we used the same setting of the parameters whose values we took from [14].
