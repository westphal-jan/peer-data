At the core of the AHP are various prioritization procedures (PPs) and consistency measures (CMs) for a Pairwise Comparison Matrix (PCM) which, in a sense, reflects preferences of decision makers. Certainly, when judgments about these preferences are perfectly consistent (cardinally transitive), all PPs coincide and the quality of the priority ratios (PRs) estimation is exemplary. However, human judgments are very rarely consistent, thus the quality of PRs estimation may significantly vary. The scale of these variations depends on the applied PP and utilized CM for a PCM. This is why it is important to find out which PPs and which CMs for a PCM lead directly to an improvement of the PRs estimation accuracy. The main goal of this research is realized through the properly designed, coded and executed seminal and sophisticated simulation algorithms in Wolfram Mathematica 8.0. These research results convince that the embedded in the AHP and commonly applied, both genuine PP and CM for PCM may significantly deteriorate the quality of PRs estimation; however, solutions proposed in this paper can significantly improve the methodology.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 17:25:39 GMT  (342kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01944v1", "30 pages, 11 tables, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 19 Jun 2017 23:18:34 GMT  (306kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01944v2", "30 pages, 11 tables, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "30 pages, 11 tables, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paul thaddeus kazibudzki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01944"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.01944.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The quality of priority ratios estimation in relation to a selected prioritization procedure and consistency measure for a Pairwise Comparison Matrix", "authors": ["Paul Thaddeus KAZIBUDZKI"], "emails": ["emailpoczta@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "1 submission to Annals of Operations Research on 19 November 2016: ANOR-D-16-01103Keywords: pairwise comparisons, priority rates, consistency, AHP, Monte Carlo simulations"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "It's as if it's an attempt to change the world.

However, there are alternative PPs that have been developed to deal with this problem. However, many of them rely on optimization and seek a vector w as a solution to the minimization problem given by the formula: min D (x), A (w)), A (4), which are subject to some assigned constraints, such as positive coefficients and normalization conditions. Since the removal function D measures an interval between matrices A (x) and A (x), different ways of definition lead to different prioritization concepts and prioritization outcomes. As an example, Choo et al describes and compares the eighteenth approaches for ranking purposes, although some authors suggest that there are only ten different ones."}, {"heading": "The first problem study", "text": "In view of the exemplary study by Saaty & Hu (1998), it seems that the best way to analyze the problem is to investigate whether different PPs are really inferior in the estimation of the actual PVs whose intention is an accurate estimate. (From this perspective, only computer simulations can shed light on the question, because it is possible to develop an algorithm that allows simulation of various types of errors that may occur during the judgement process, and to enable an evaluation to be made of the selected PPs. (from a given perspective) of the real PV. Thus, the following simulation algorithm was constructed. Assuming that the decision problem can be presented in the form of a three-tiered hierarchy (goal, criteria and alternatives - see Figure 1), in order to emulate the problem presented in Saaty Hu (1998), the hypothetical hierarchy is also conceived as four criteria and four alternatives with priority."}, {"heading": "Description of the second problem", "text": "In the previous two sections of this research, it was found that the quality of the PV estimate depends on the selected PKP = \u03b2 PCP = \u03b2 11.

However, the answer to this question seems to be affirmative, which is often why one tries to maintain PCM consistency at the highest level. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to use universally recognized PCM CMs for this purpose? To answer this question, a preliminary analysis of the example is provided and given in the section entitled \"Description of the First Problem.\" Thus, the true PV is reconsidered, w = [7 / 20, 1 / 4, 3 / 20] and A (w) derived from this PV is presented as follows: A (w) = 15 / 35 / 5117 / 53 / 75 / 775 / 71Ms"}, {"heading": "Breakthroughs and milestones of the research", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of us are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

At the core of the AHP are various prioritization procedures (PPs) and consistency measures (CMs) for a Pairwise Comparison Matrix (PCM) which, in a sense, reflects preferences of decision makers. Certainly, when judgments about these preferences are perfectly consistent (cardinally transitive), all PPs coincide and the quality of the priority ratios (PRs) estimation is exemplary. However, human judgments are very rarely consistent, thus the quality of PRs estimation may significantly vary. The scale of these variations depends on the applied PP and utilized CM for a PCM. This is why it is important to find out which PPs and which CMs for a PCM lead directly to an improvement of the PRs estimation accuracy. The main goal of this research is realized through the properly designed, coded and executed seminal and sophisticated simulation algorithms in Wolfram Mathematica 8.0. These research results convince that the embedded in the AHP and commonly applied, both genuine PP and CM for PCM may significantly deteriorate the quality of PRs estimation; however, solutions proposed in this paper can significantly improve the methodology.", "creator": "PDFCreator Version 0.9.3"}}}
