As it is more than simply linked data, semantics encoded in a KG enables tasks that can be challenging in simple RDF models with linked data. Metadata faceting, provenance tracking, and context awareness are examples of advanced functions that can support KGs. Google KG [14] gained popularity in an effort to supplement Freebase [3] (which can also be considered a KG), Wikipedia, and the CIA World Factbook3 with the queries and results of its search engine. Academic KGs are also available, including YAGO [2] [8] and DBpedia [1]."}, {"heading": "2.1 City Modeling", "text": "The process of modeling a city is complex, and the intrinsic complexity of interactions between urban entities makes it very difficult to map relevant sets of dynamic aspects that are often used to characterize a city. Furthermore, these interactions, along with the numerous entities and processes, differ from city to city. Therefore, the process of modeling a city is typically application-centered, with modeling directed toward a specific goal. Therefore, this approach aims to support the process across disciplines and cities by determining which characteristics need to be modeled. [15] proposes a central conceptual model for the domain knowledge model of a smart city, which originally included multiple domains and cities. The proposed work aims to support interoperability by specifying terms from different actors."}, {"heading": "2.2 Data Annotation", "text": "Data can be encrypted in many different formats such as CSV, XML and NetCDF [12]. In many cases, CSV is a format of choice due to its ease of use for both automated actors and human actors. Human actors often enter the acquired data manually in a spreadsheet (e.g. MS Excel or LibreOffice Calc). Spreadsheets are also able to export content in CSV format. Basically, the CSV format can be seen as a minimalist approach to data interoperability. Regardless of the format, we are not aware that a single encryption has been able to provide effective mechanisms for annotating data in a way that supports data collection as contextualized data3 https: / www.cia.gov / library / publications / the-world-factbookpoint collection."}, {"heading": "2.3 Indicators", "text": "ISO 37120: 2014 [9] is a standard that defines 100 indicators in 17 subject areas that have been evaluated to provide a precise method of measuring the performance of a city and its quality of life, covering areas such as economy, education, health and security. The main objective of this standard is to provide a precise set of well-defined global indicators that each city can use to measure itself. In addition, cities that comply with this standard are able to compare themselves and evaluate how well they compare to others. The PolisGnosis Project [5] uses the ISO standard and is the final goal of ongoing efforts by the University of Toronto. The project aims to: - To provide a description of all 100 ISO indicators related to ontologies for the semantic network; - To develop an engine capable of conducting analyses to identify fundamental causes of differences in why indicators differ from cities over time and why."}, {"heading": "3 City Knowledge Graph", "text": "These requirements ensure that the Indicator4 http: / / www.w3.org / 2013 / csvw / wiki / Main _ Page 5 http: / / ontology.eil.utoronto.cagut is defined and the calculation process generates trustworthy values. We have identified the following requirements: - Time Coverage: Indicator values carry more representativeness when calculated using data from a specified timeframe. - Provenance: Indicators can relate to a specific set of activities and / or data sources that have improved or deteriorated in a given year. - Context: Indicator definitions relate to designated units, so it is important to provide formal definitions for these units. - Provenance: Indicators can relate to a specific set of activities and / or data sources. - Context: Indicators can also relate to data acquired under certain conditions, which makes context management important."}, {"heading": "3.1 Metadata Ontologies", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "3.2 Indicator and Domain Ontologies", "text": "In the neeisrcnlhsAe\u00fccnlh hta es ni red eeisrrcnlhsrtee\u00fccnlhSe ni red eeisrrmnlrVrtee\u00fceegnln rf\u00fc ide eeisrrrteeeoiKn ni rde eeisrsrteeVnlrrteeegnlrteeeeeeeerln rf\u00fc eeisrrrrteeeeeeeerrrVnlrteeoiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}, {"heading": "3.3 KG Serialization", "text": "The serialization process of the KGs is about transferring the data from the KGs together with all their metadata into a physical file, so that third-party applications can use all the knowledge associated with the data. To do this, routines have been developed that do the following: 1. For each class of domain ontology, a file is created with valid instances; 2. For each file, write the instances as CSV registers with each column three times in the KGs in which the instance is the subject; 12 http: / / hadatac.org / ont / qoe-m3. Write down each register and column in CCSV format; 4. Add to the annotations the study, provision and data collection that relate to the data in the file; 5. Discover suitable indicators based on the annotated data and export them in the Turtle format.The next section describes how this serialization was carried out in the context of urban mobility."}, {"heading": "4 Dashboard Application", "text": "In this work, we have developed one of many possible applications: a dashboard generator. A commonly used data visualization technology is a dashboard that represents a set of data-based quantifications, graphs, metrics, etc. In addition, dashboards allow human-machine interaction based on graphical visualizations that support a number of data analyses through the use of filters that can be applied to the data. The results of a filter application can be shown in real time by recalculating the measures. By the dynamic dashboard, we mean that the indicators displayed on the dashboard are based on data."}, {"heading": "4.1 Dataset characterization and KG manipulation", "text": "To load these data sets into the system, we first had to characterize their metadata in the following aspects: - > Data Source: What ICT system or device generated this data? - Data Collection: What data collection activities were used to collect them? < - > Data Source: What ICT systems or devices generated this data? - Time Frames: When were the datasets created? - Time Frames: We only used the metadata related to the travels? < - > Data Source is cited in the thesis, namely the CCSV format and the CCSV loader application. < - Time Frames: Listing 1.1 shows a portion of the KG13 after loading the datasets, we present only the metadata related to the travels. < - The data source is shown in rows 14-22, where both the annotator software and the existing ICT system are described, while the annotator software was used along the system date."}, {"heading": "4.2 Dashboard building", "text": "For this implementation, we focused on Qlik Sense14, which provides an API for programmatically creating and setting up visualizations. First, the user enters the serialized KG and indicator files. Then, the tool performs SPARQL queries against the indicators and metadata of the KG to retrieve them: (i) the entity column; (ii) the entity column; and (iii) the calculation function. Fig. 4 shows the Semantic BI generator after the serialized KG and discovered metadata have been loaded. On the left, a preview of the entity / Id column to be generated is presented, while on the right, it is possible to modify or add new visualizations as desired. In this case, the Qig files and discovered metrics are loaded."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We have presented an operational description for a City Knowledge Graph that supports the automatic generation of dashboards, along with an indicator ontology that supports data visualization techniques. In order to build our KG and develop our indicator ontology, we have reused many existing ontologies that describe the metadata required to be identified. We have also proposed an extension of the GCI ontology that focuses on data visualization concepts. A process for serializing Kg with indicator discovery has been undertaken as a way to promote interoperability between the Kg and third-party applications. The City KG and QoE ontology have been used in conjunction with the Semantic Business Intelligence Generator, a dashboard that generates an application capable of performing CCSV metadata analysis. Potentially more importantly, the presented contributions are available to users without prior knowledge of the data (by whom and how they were generated)."}], "references": [{"title": "DBpedia: A Nucleus for a Web of Open Data", "author": ["S.
