Frequency modulation FM is a nonlinear encoding of information in a carrier wave. In this paper, we present a novel application of Software Defined Radio (SDR) based on LSTM-recurrent neural networks to decode audio signals from their noisy, frequency-modulated version."}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Frequency modulation (FM) is commonly used for the transmission of audio signals representing a voice. However, detection reliability significantly deteriorates with weak signal components and low input noise. However, FM power deteriorates sharply when system noise exceeds a critical value, significantly reducing the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio above this critical point, a phenomenon known as the threshold effect. Due to the threshold effect, information signal detection is poor and, as a result, the intelligibility and quality of the transmitted language.A monitored method based on deep neural networks (DNNs) is proposed for demodulation and improvement of the speech signal. This method allows for more accurate reconstruction of the signal under interference in the transmission channel under low SNR noise conditions. In the case of low noise, this method achieves marginally inferior performance than the traditional FM demodulator, which uses prior knowledge of the transmission code beyond the suggested method with extremely high real-time capability."}, {"heading": "2. PROBLEM FORMULATION", "text": "In this form of modulation, the instantaneous frequency deviation, i.e. the difference between the frequency of the transmitted wave and its carrier frequency, becomes proportional to the modulated voice signal. In communication systems, the statistical model for the channel is usually assumed to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Therefore, receivers are normally designed for this channel. However, communication systems in the real world may have to operate under low SNR conditions, highly non-stationary noise environments and unknown channel models and channel statistics. Under the above conditions, the perceived signal quality is greatly deteriorated, and existing communication systems do not properly suppress interference in such conditions. For these conditions, which achieve high speech intelligibility, is a very challenging and important problem. As mentioned, optimal signal estimation algorithms are usually constructed on the basis of statistical properties of the measurement process and previous statistical or deterrent problems."}, {"heading": "3. METHOD DESCRIPTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Dataset and training procedure", "text": "In order to reduce the computing requirements, we work only on the baseband signal, the conversion from the intermediate frequency to the baseband can be done with other digital or analog hardware. The audio set used is generated by Matlab FM modulation of comm Package with the following properties: peak deviation of the output signal frequency 75 KHz and sampling frequency of the modulated signal 240 KHz. The audio used was downloaded from freesound.org and the remaining 10% were used as a test set. To enter the neural network, we use two features, sampling of the in-phase and sampling components of the baseband signal 60, for the output of the neural network we take the four sample stamps (general audio phases) corresponding to the window length of the used signal component, whereby the sampling recommendation of the signal Sample depends on the time span used signal depends on the intermediate frequency."}, {"heading": "3.2. Architecture", "text": "The following neural network architecture has been proposed: two input functions, each consisting of a size 60 sequence, for the real and imaginary parts of the baseband signal are fed into an LSTM layer with 60 neurons, the output of this network feeds into another LSTM layer with 120 neurons, and finally a fully connected neural feed network with four outputs has been added."}, {"heading": "4. RELATED WORK", "text": "Traditionally, radio decoding and speech enhancement are considered two separate problems. Apart from the traditional methods of decoding radio transmissions and decoding minimal middle square speech enhancement techniques (MMSE), several, if not many, neural methods have been proposed separately for each of the above two problems, e.g. for radio demodulation application: M. Amini et al. \"Universal Neural Network Demodulator for Software Defined Radio\" [5], kamyar rohani et al. \"The design of multi-layered perceptrons using building blocks.\" [6] Although none of the above examples of applications has yielded good results in the case of FM demodulators, a new paper by Yong Xu et al. [7] also suggests a DNN-based speech enhancement system. To our knowledge, there is no work similar to our research proposal, with a regressive DNR transmission model being used to decode previous speech."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "In both cases, the modulated signal sampling rate is set to 240 KHz and the frequency deviation to 75 KHz. Next, we will represent network performance against standard demodulation for various levels of AWGN. In the case of color noise, we expect the network to learn noise statistics and achieve even greater performance improvement. For each noise level, the network has been retrained with a new dataset with the same noise level."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have presented a new approach to decoding FM transmission of audio speech signals using deep learning and LSTM in particular. Constructing an SDR based on neural networks of such magnitudes has only recently become practicable with the advent of powerful graphical processing units (GPU) and appropriate software, and the estimation of audio signal quality is not part of this work and needs to be taken into account in future research."}, {"heading": "7.
