Value of this kind of marketing has improved in time, thanks to the latest developments regarding to computer and communication technologies. Nowadays, especially social media based platforms have a great importance on enabling companies to design multimedia oriented, interactive content. But on the other hand, there is still something more to do for improved content marketing approaches. In this context, objective of this study is to focus on intelligent content marketing, which can be done by using artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is todays one of the most remarkable research fields and it can be used easily as multidisciplinary. So, this study has aimed to discuss about its potential on improving content marketing. In detail, the study has enabled readers to improve their awareness about the intersection point of content marketing and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the authors have introduced some example models of intelligent content marketing, which can be achieved by using current Web technologies and artificial intelligence techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 07:31:39 GMT  (640kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02114v1", "8 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["utku kose", "selcuk sert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02114"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.02114.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["utku.kose@usak.edu.tr", "selcuk.sert@usak.edu.tr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "2.1 Ways of Content Marketing", "text": "According to Steimle (2014), the key factor in content marketing is valuable. He says briefly on this topic: \"You can tell if a content could be part of a content marketing campaign if people are looking for it, if they want to consume it, rather than avoid it.\" (Steimle, 2014) From a general perspective, content marketing in many different formats can be done as follows (De Clerck, 2016; Farnworth, 2015; Omedia24, 2014; Steimle, 2014): news, videos, white papers, e-books, information graphics, e-mail newsletters, case studies, podcasts, how-to-guides, question-and-answer articles, photos, blogs (and many other components capable of arousing the interest of the target audience)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Essential Objectives of Content Marketing", "text": "The literature contains many explanations of the general objectives of well-designed content marketing. Here, one can focus on the ideas of Rose and Pullizzi on the objectives of content marketing. They define the objectives of content marketing as (Rose and Pullizzi, 2011): brand awareness / strengthening, lead conversion and maintenance, customer conversion, customer service, customer upsell, passionate subscribers. All of these objectives are attempted to be achieved through the development and development of content marketing models, thanks to the latest technological factors. At this point, information and communication play an important role in the use of various things to improve / shape the current and future state of content marketing. For this reason, the focus of this study is on answering the question of applying alternative approaches to improve content marketing and thinking about artificial intelligence for it. III. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON CONTENT MARKETINGTo understand more about the collaboration between content marketing and artificial intelligence, it is better to think about which aspects of artificial intelligence can be applied to marketing."}, {"heading": "3.1 Supporting Content Marketing with Artificial Intelligence", "text": "In fact, content marketing can be accepted as a big process that involves different stages that reach up to the application of a designed content marketing scenario. By eliminating details, it is possible to think about three stages: preparation, application, revision in terms of content marketing. At this point, we can say that artificial intelligence can be used in each of these stages by selecting appropriate approaches, methods and techniques."}, {"heading": "3.2 Solutions for Content Marketing by Artificial Intelligence", "text": "If we look at the levels we have just indicated for content marketing, it is possible to determine which problem-solving avenues of artificial intelligence can be used to make everything better for the content marketing of a company. Some of these are predictions, optimization, expert support, adaptive guidance (for customers / users) and troubleshooting (detected along the marketing process).Some popular artificial intelligence techniques with respect to the solutions / operations mentioned are: artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, neuro-fuzzy inference systems, expert systems, swarm intelligence-based algorithms, o particle swarm optimization, o ant colony optimization, o artificial bee colony, o cuckoo search, o krill herd algorithm, o... etc. Machine learning techniques. The field of artificial intelligence includes many different techniques that are currently being developed to allow readers to understand more precisely what is currently too common to the field."}, {"heading": "2008; Cartwright, 2015; C\u00f3rdoba et al., 2016; Giarratano and Riley, 1998; Goldberg, 2006; Jackson, 1998;", "text": "Kennedy et al., 2001; Klir and Yuan, 1995; Kubat, 2015; Mitchell, 1998; Parouha and Das, 2016; Yegnanarayana, 2009).If we focus on more details regarding the content marketing process, it is possible to calculate our solutions through artificial intelligence. The main factor for artificial intelligence is to make content marketing or its process more adaptable, flexible, interactive and intelligent, according to the needs and interests of customers / users. Of course, there are many different ways to achieve this. As there are different types of content marketing environments and approaches, it is also possible to develop many combinations of intelligent content marketing processes.IV. EXAMPLE MODELS FOR INTELLIGENT CONTENT MARKETINGIn the context of the related topics on which the authors have just focused, it is possible to think about exceptional examples of intelligent marketing."}, {"heading": "4.1 Example Model 1: \u201cIntelligent scenario - target customer / user determining\u201d", "text": "The first example scenario for intelligent content marketing is based on dividing the associated marketing scenario into some elements and creating a general adaptive scenario that changes over time depending on the feedback to the elements. In detail, this scenario is based on digital content that can be delivered over the Web. However, the most important key factor in this digital content is the use of some elements to design it. In this context, the digital content may include a medium (i.e. video, sound and animation), some text or some features that can receive feedback from objective customers / users (i.e. comments under content such as - reject options and rating buttons).Here, there is a control mechanism that controls the values of each element under an artificial neural network model, and according to the controlled values values, an endpoint is set for the scenario, and then the endpoint is used to determine where the scenario is made available to. At this point, the target customers / beginners may be the ones who should see the scenario more closely that they should."}, {"heading": "4.2 Example Model 2: \u201cOptimized scenario\u201d", "text": "The second model of intelligent content marketing refers to a typical optimization approach based on artificial intelligence. In this model, the scenario (based on digital content) is not evaluated as if it had some elements. Rather, some key values within the application of the scenario (i.e. number of total views of the scenario, total number of tickets sold, total cost, income and result) are used to calculate an objective success ratio under a general equation that can be formed by experts. In this equation, there are also some additional variables that should be optimized (i.e. total number of next higher view of the scenario, total number of target customers / users, application priority of the scenario among some other alternatives). After a while the scenario is applied, the variables are optimized according to the objective success ratio and the next steps regarding the fate of the scenario are determined by the persons controlling the marketing process, according to new values of the scenario, the processes associated with it are naturally satisfied and continue until the end."}, {"heading": "4.3 Example Model 3: \u201cIntelligent evaluation of social media\u201d", "text": "It is clear that social media is a strong environment for companies / brands to maintain successful customer contact. Starting from this point, it is possible to make greater use of social media to design digital content that is useful for marketing processes. In this context, the authors believe that the corresponding marketing applications carried out with the power of social media can be improved through the use of artificial intelligence. In detail, it is possible to evaluate feedback about social media environments and direct social media-based operations according to the rating results obtained. These rating processes can be based on an expert systems approach or complex optimization calculations that lead to understanding something about, for example, the company / brand page and shared advertising. Figure 3 provides a short scheme for the model."}, {"heading": "4.4 Example Model 4: \u201cSelf-learning digital content\u201d", "text": "Another idea of smart content marketing refers to the use of smart digital content. The main mechanism of such digital content is to update / improve itself by using some parameters in terms of its possible interactions with customers / users. For example, digital content that has received too little feedback from customers / users can change something to make itself more attractive, or content that is growing in popularity can refresh itself to adapt more to different web environments."}, {"heading": "4.5 Example Model 5: \u201cIntelligent customer / user tracers\u201d", "text": "This model of intelligent content marketing is more about understanding the behavior of customers / users on the web while using a web-based platform. In detail, this model includes a kind of swarm that allows smart, small programs to track customers / users in the background and at the end, and to inform the main system about which customers / users can be attracted by using what elements about a potential content that can be used for marketing purposes. In short, this model can be accepted as a typical, intelligent version of cookies that are widely used on web platforms that need to store some data for their users. However, the smart customer / user tracking approach that is being considered here is more than just storing data. This model is associated with some features to track customers / users, collect data while interacting with multimedia objects, web interfaces, other customers / users, etc., and analyze this data to provide ideas for possible marketing components."}, {"heading": "4.6 Example Model 6: \u201cIntelligent strategy path determiner\u201d", "text": "It is possible to design a model that is not only used for marketing, but also for marketing."}], "references": [{"title": "The impact of social media content marketing (SMCM) towards brand health", "author": ["N.S.
