Bioinformatics", "text": "In this experiment, we aim to group similar patterns using the proposed VMKM algorithm in the yeast bioinformatics dataset [7]. The dataset contains 6400 gene expression values of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that were recorded during the metabolic change from fermentation to respiration using DNA microarrays. As the dataset is large and consists of genes with low expression values, we trim the dataset by retaining only those genes that exhibit drastically altered expression profiles during the diauxic shift. The dataset is further refined by assigning one to the series in which the yeast values have a variance greater than the 10th percentile, while the values below that value are represented by zero. The VMKM algorithm is used to group the data into sixteen gene expression profiles. The quantitative results for the gene table for the classification are measured on the basis of the MSE."}, {"heading": "C. Remote Sensing", "text": "The remote sensing data set used is a four-band multi-spectral image of the district of Mysore in the southern part of India [13]. The image has dimensions of 1375 x 5929 pixels, an area of 2.748 km x 7.973 km and a resolution of 2.4 m. The image maps information on four crop classes (sugarcane, ragi, brushwood and mulberry) from different fields in the area. Multiple images facilitate the classification and identification of plants by taking into account changes in reflection as a function of the crop type. This information allows individuals to track the positive and negative dynamics of crop development as well as several natural processes such as erosion, soil composition and vegetation conditions that can help government officials plan efficient land use and plant management. In this study, we aim to divide the satellite image into four crop classes, using the proposed VMKM cluster method, which is similar to the quantitative results proposed for the seven plant classification table with MSE being the most comparable to the MSE."}, {"heading": "D. Stock Market", "text": "The VMKM algorithm is used to cluster all stocks that have a greater variance in five clusters (K = 5) and therefore have a better chance of a positive return. Quantitative results for stock identification are presented in Table I. The proposed method is also compared with seven other popular cluster methods. It is shown in the table that K-Means produces the highest MSE, followed by AMKM, MKM, EMKM-2, EMKM1 and FCM. The best cluster is provided by Kernel K-Means and VMKM with similarly low MSE.Fig.4. Graph compares the average MSE of different algorithms applied to the master data set."}, {"heading": "E. Comparison of VMKM with Kernel K Means", "text": "Table I shows that kernel K-Means performs almost as well for bioinformatics, remote sensing and stock market as the proposed algorithm. Despite the comparable performance of kernel K-Means for VMKM and the ability to separate non-linear data, it has some obvious disadvantages. The former is a complex algorithm with great time complexity. In addition, knowledge of the kernel K-Means to be used for data separation is indispensable before applying kernel K-Means. VMKM has no such limitations, making it a superior choice compared to kernel K-Means.IV. CONCLUSS This paper presents a new version of the MKM algorithm called Variance based Moving K-Means (VMKM). The process of assigning and subsequently transferring data elements takes into account the cluster variance and correlation of the data company adjacent to the parent company as well as the cluster."}], "references": [{"title": "A comparison of biclustering with clustering algorithms", "author": ["A.
