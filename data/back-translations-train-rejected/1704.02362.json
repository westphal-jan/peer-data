Audience members not only clap whenever they want, they do so only at specific points, constantly searching for appropriate times when applause is possible (Kuo, 2001). Deep understanding of the audience is important because it helps speakers shape their speech with recognizable calls for a common response, and to make their presentation more attractive. Despite its importance, relatively limited work has been done on the topic of the applause generation, with the exception of some qualitative studies conducted by social psychologists. Atkinson (1984) initially claimed that applause is closely synchronized with a number of actions on the part of speakers whom he calls \"rhetorical devices.\""}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Data Collection", "text": "To answer our research questions, we are writing a script to collect 2,135 TED lecture videos from 2006 June to 2016 September. We are using TED lectures as the dataset of this study because TED lectures are widely used as a good source for learning presentation skills in various areas. Additionally, there is a validated transcript for each TED lecture. Cheers have been marked on each transcript in the format \"(applause).\" Using the marked cheers, we segment each lecture into several blocks, each of which is associated with a cheer. Delete all cheers at the end of the speech from the transcripts, because no matter what the speaker says, the audience will always applaud at the end to be polite. These deletions leave us with 904 lectures consisting of a total of 3,178 cheers."}, {"heading": "Hypothesized Rhetorical Devices", "text": "To answer our RQ1, we propose hypothetical rhetorical devices from 7 different perspectives derived from both theories and observations. Linguistic Style - We rely on LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001) to capture the language used by the speakers to generate applause. We exclude words from the \"Affective or Emotional Processes\" subcategory (reasons discussed below). We assume that the linguistic styles of LIWC learn (e.g. personal pronouns, insights) rhetorical devices such as references, and tracking, emotional expression - speakers can move the audience by arousing emotions in their representations (Petty et al). We rely on the NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013) for the identification of emotions."}, {"heading": "Modeling Approach", "text": "For RQ1, we use logistical regression to examine the associations between the 78 hypothetical rhetorical devices and the applause evoked. We use the one sentence just before the applause as a positive example, because before responding to RQ2, we treat the last sentence before the applause as its triggers. 2 For negative examples, we randomly select the same number of sentences from the beginning of each applause-segmented piece, resulting in a data set of 6,356 datasets. For RQ2, we build binary classification models to distinguish applause applause-dissecting segments from non-applause-dissecting segments by using the hypothesized rhetorical devices."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "RQ1: Effective Rhetorical Devices Identification", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to be able to look for a solution that is capable of resolving the problems that we have got to grips with."}, {"heading": "RQ2: Applause Prediction", "text": "In Table 2, we showed the classification results for each subset of rhetorical tools. Due to the spatial limitation, we reported only the results of logistical regression, as it performed best. Overall, our model obtained a classification accuracy of 71.9% with all hypothetical rhetorical tools, which is significantly higher than the baseline of 50% chosen by the majority. With respect to each set of characteristics, we found that, consistent with the results of our regression analysis in RQ1, the subset of expressions of appreciation and gratitude demonstrated the highest discriminatory power. Linguistic styles, emotional expressions, phonetic structure and applauding expressions are also related to the initiation of applause. However, rhetorical features such as the projection of names and the use of rhetorical questions alone are not sufficient to predict the events of the audience. Next, we tested whether the inclusion of more sentences in our prediction model could increase its accuracy."}, {"heading": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "This paper addresses an important but less stressed social psychological problem of applause. We proposed hypothetical rhetorical tools from seven perspectives for generating applause during public discourse. By regression analysis, we found 24 rhetorical tools that are significantly associated with the process of generating applause, and developed a model to predict it. We believe our work is fairly unique and important because we are the first study to understand the rhetorical tools for generating applause on a relatively large scale using quantitative methods. These results can help system designers develop better tools to help speakers generate more engaged speeches. For example, our proposed model can notify speakers when the audience applauds at a certain point in their speech as expected. Moreover, our results, such as \"avoid angry expressions\" and \"be more forward-looking, less retrospective,\" can be used as valuable insights for speakers in preparing their speech."}], "references": [{"title": "Public speaking and audience responses: Some techniques for inviting applause", "author": ["J.M.

Introduction and Motivation Many academic studies have been devoted to the tasks of user engagement characterization. However, applause, as the most direct audience reaction, has till now not been fully investigated and understood. The audience do not just clap whenever they like, they do so only at certain points and are continuously looking for appropriate times when applause can possibly occur (Kuo, 2001). Having a deep understanding of audience\u2019s applause is important because it will help the speakers to better design their speech with recognizable calls for conjoined response, and to make their presentation more appealing and engageable. Despite its importance, to date relatively limited work have been conducted on the topic of applause generation, except a few qualitative studies done by social psychologists. Atkinson (1984) first claimed that applause is closely synchronized with a number of actions on the part of the speakers, which he referred to as \u201crhetorical devices\u201d. He identified three rhetorical devices that are effective in evoking applauses, including: contrasts, three-part lists, and projection of names. Heritage and Greatbatch (1986) found five other basic rhetorical devices, including: puzzlesolution, headline-punchline, combination, position taking This is a pre-print of an article appearing at ICWSM 2017. and pursuit. In addition, new categories were also identified in many recent studies, such as greetings, expressing appreciations, etc. (Bull and Feldman, 2011). To date, research on applause generation has been limited to the analysis of political speeches only. Besides, all of the aforementioned work were conducted using qualitative methods. Many critical questions, such as, What triggers the audience\u2019s applause?, When do audience applaud?, etc., remain unanswered. To address these gaps, this work aims to identify the rhetorical devices for applause elicitation using data-driven methods. To this end, we propose two research questions: RQ1: What are the rhetorical devices that cause the audiences to applaud during a specific part of a speech? RQ2: To what extent the hypothesized rhetorical devices can be used to predict applause generation? To answer both questions, we crawl 2,135 TED talk transcripts and conduct quantitative analysis to investigate the factors that could trigger audience\u2019s applause. We find that factors such as, gratitude expressions, phonetic structure, projection of names, emotion, etc., have significant effects on applause generation. These identified factors are later used to build machine learning models that can automatically identify applause-evoking segments.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2016"}}}
