These are excerpts from original conversations; the first comment, generated by the author C0, on each excerpt is given as a minimal piece of context; the second comment, phrased in italics by the author C1, is the comment that is suspected of being a trolling event; the rest of the comments are all direct reactions to the suspected trolling event. If the response author \"name\" matches the first comment, it indicates that the same person has also responded to the suspected troll. Example 1. C0: My friend, who earns $20,000 a year, has leased a brand new Chevy Spark EV, for only $75 a month, and he has a California discount for driving an electric car. Much cheaper than buying older cars that normally require heavy maintenance due to their mileage.

This problem can be considered a multi-task prediction. To do this, we divide the data set into training and test sets using a 5x cross-validation setup."}, {"heading": "3.1 Feature Set", "text": "To predict, we define two types of attributes, a simple and an extended dataset, which are extracted from each comment in the dataset.

In their research on bullying (Nitta et al., 2013), we identified a small set of highly offensive words. We encode them as well as binary traits. Emotional synsets. As in (Xu et al., 2012b), we extracted all the lemmas associated with each of these synsets from the WordNet (Miller et al., 1995): anger, embarrassment, empathy, fear, pride, relief, and sadness.

Such a system would deprive the tasks we have mentioned of information that is strictly necessary to make a correct prediction of the response strategy. Instead, we take a pipeline approach as a starting point, using the tasks or: I, D, R and B, so that each of the subsequent functions of the subtasks is extended by one trait per each of the previously calculated subtasks. We argue that this structure represents a competitive baseline, as can be confirmed in Table 1. For the classifier in the pipeline approach, we choose a log-linear model, a classifier of logistic regression 5. In addition to logistic regression, we tried generative supplementation of logistic regression, naive bayes and a maximum margin classifier, a support vector machine, but its performance was not superior to logistic regression."}, {"heading": "3.3 Joint Models", "text": "The nature of this problem makes the use of a common model a logical choice. Among the various options for common conclusions, we choose a (conditional) probabilistic graphical model (henceforth PGM) (Koller and Friedman, 2009) because, unlike ILP formulations, it has the ability to learn parameters and not just impose hard constraints. Also, compared to Markov Logic Networks (Richardson and Domingos, 2006), a relatively new formulation that combines logic and Markov Random Fields, the PGMs have proven to be more scalable in practice, even if conclusions are shown in general models to be intractable. Finally, we are also interested in the selection of a PGM because it allows us to directly compare the strength of common inference with the baseline, because our model is a collection of logistic regressors that we train simultaneously.A conditional random field factorizes the distribution of conditional probabilities over all possible values we observe in the quantum variables in the model."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation and Results", "text": "System performance is measured by precision, recall, and F-1 as shown in Table 1. The left side of the table reports results obtained using the basic feature set, while the right side does so using the extended feature set. To obtain the consistency fold based on threads or snippets, and in the case of the baseline system, all instances in the respective fold are considered independent for the task. In the table, rows show class performance for each of the tasks specified by a receiver with the task name. For the response strategy, we present results for those class values that represent at least 5% of the total distribution, since the number of designated instances for these classes is statistically insignificant compared to the majority classes."}, {"heading": "4.1 Results Discussion", "text": "Result Table 1 shows that the hybrid model significantly exceeds the baseline by more than 20 points in predicting intention and intention. For the response strategy, it is clear that none of the systems provides satisfactory results; this demonstrates the difficulty of such a large number of classes. Nevertheless, the hybrid model outperforms the fully common model and baseline in all but one of the response strategy classes. However, the differences are far less impressive than in the other tasks. It is surprising that the full common model did not perform best. One of the reasons for this is that intentions, disclosure and interpretation tasks are violated by the difficulty of learning parameters that maximize the response strategy, this last task drags the other three down in their performance. Another reason is that the response strategy of the features is not informative enough to learn the right concept, and due to the common inference process, all tasks get a hit. Moreover, it is counterintuitive that the series of expected characteristics is intuitive, rather than intuitive."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "In this section we will discuss related work in the areas of trolling, bullying and politeness, as they overlap in scope and at least partially address the problem presented in this work. (Mihaylov et al., 2015) address the problem of identifying manipulation roles in message community forums. The main difference to this work is that all of its predictions are based on meta-information such as number of voices, data, number of comments, etc. There is no NLP approach to the problem and its task is limited to identifying trolls. (Bishop, 2013) and (Bishop, 2014) elaborate a detailed description of the personality of the troll, its motivations, impact on the community trolls interfere in, and the criminal and psychological aspects of the troll. Their main focus is on flaming trolls, but they do not provide insights from the NLP and automated prediction tasks as in this work. In a network-based framework (Kumar et al, 2014 and Guha et al), the method of identifying individuals is exclusively based on the NLLP."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we address the little-known problem of trolling in internet forums. We presented a comprehensive categorization of trolling events and defined a predictive task that not only looks at trolling from the troll's perspective, but also includes responses to trolls \"comments. In addition, we evaluated three different models and analyzed their successes and shortcomings. Finally, we provide an annotated dataset that we hope will be useful to the research community. We look forward to exploring trolling phenomena in larger conversations, formalizing the concepts of a role shift between participants in trolling events, and improving response strategies."}, {"heading": "A Response Strategy Definitions", "text": "1. Normal: unemotional and default reaction to a comment that is not a trolling event. 2. Biting attempts: malicious response to a comment by a parent that is not a trolling event. 3. Imaginary Bite: angry response in the belief that he / she is being deceived, but without the intention of trolling back. 4. False accusation: comment criticism or denunciation of malicious intentions of the parent comment, but the parent comment has no malicious intentions. 5. Frustrating: comment that acknowledges the malicious or playful intentions of the parent, but refuses to engage in or fall into the provocation because it does not attach importance to them. 6. Neutralizes: comment that acknowledges the malicious or playful intentions and tries to overbalize or criticize them. 7. Counter trolling: Comment that the malicious or playful intentions of the trolling are disregarded."}], "references": [{"title": "The effect of de-individuation of the internet troller on criminal procedure implementation: An interview with a hater", "author": ["Jonathan Bishop"], "venue": "International Journal of Cyber Criminology,", "citeRegEx": "Bishop.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bishop.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Representations of trolls in mass media communication: a review of media-texts and moral panics relating to internet trolling", "author": ["Jonathan Bishop"], "venue": "International Journal of Web Based Communities,", "citeRegEx": "Bishop.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bishop.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "A limited memory algorithm for bound constrained optimization", "author": ["Byrd et al.1995] Richard H Byrd", "Peihuang Lu", "Jorge Nocedal", "Ciyou Zhu"], "venue": "SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing,", "citeRegEx": "Byrd et al\\.,? \\Q1995\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Byrd et al\\.", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Do not feel the trolls", "author": ["Cambria et al.2010] Erik Cambria", "Praphul Chandra", "Avinash Sharma", "Amir Hussain"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Cambria et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Cambria et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "A computational approach to politeness with application to social factors", "author": ["Moritz Sudhof", "Dan Jurafsky", "Jure Leskovec", "Christopher Potts"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Danescu.Niculescu.Mizil et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Danescu.Niculescu.Mizil et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "The equivalence of weighted kappa and the intraclass correlation coefficient as measures of reliability", "author": ["Fleiss", "Cohen1973] Joseph L Fleiss", "Jacob Cohen"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Fleiss et al\\.,? \\Q1973\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Fleiss et al\\.", "year": 1973}, {"title": "Propagation of trust and distrust", "author": ["Guha et al.2004] Ramanthan Guha", "Ravi Kumar", "Prabhakar Raghavan", "Andrew Tomkins"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 13th international conference on World Wide Web,", "citeRegEx": "Guha et al\\.,? \\Q2004\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Guha et al\\.", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Trolling in asynchronous computer-mediated communication: From user discussions to academic definitions", "author": ["Claire Hardaker"], "venue": "Journal of Politeness Research,", "citeRegEx": "Hardaker.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Hardaker.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Why are you taking this stance? identifying and classifying reasons in ideological debates", "author": ["Hasan", "Ng2014] Kazi Saidul Hasan", "Vincent Ng"], "venue": "In EMNLP,", "citeRegEx": "Hasan et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Hasan et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Exploiting emoticons in polarity classification of text", "author": ["Daniella Bal", "Flavius Frasincar", "Malissa Bal", "Franciska De Jong", "Uzay Kaymak"], "venue": "J.
