The full development of this skill is key for the academic and professional future of every citizen. Tools for classifying the complexity of reading materials for children aim to improve the quality of the model of teaching reading and text comprehension. For English, Fengs work [11] is considered the state-of-art in grade level prediction and achieved 74% of accuracy in automatically classifying 4 levels of textual complexity for close school grades. There are no classifiers for nonfiction texts for close grades in Portuguese. In this article, we propose a scheme for manual annotation of texts in 5 grade levels, which will be used for customized reading to avoid the lack of interest by students who are more advanced in reading and the blocking of those that still need to make further progress. We obtained 52% of accuracy in classifying texts into 5 levels and 74% in 3 levels. The results prove to be promising when compared to the state-of-art work.9", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 18:44:08 GMT  (266kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03013v1", "PROPOR International Conference on the Computational Processing of Portuguese, 2016, 9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "PROPOR International Conference on the Computational Processing of Portuguese, 2016, 9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nathan siegle hartmann", "livia cucatto", "danielle brants", "sandra alu\\'isio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03013"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.03013.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Automatic Classification of the Complexity of Nonfiction Texts in Portuguese for Early School Years", "authors": ["Nathan Hartmann", "Livia Cucatto", "Danielle Brants", "Sandra Al\u00fa\u0131sio"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Automatic reading ability test.

Brazilian students have serious problems in reading literacy. The most recent survey, conducted in 2012, shows results for Brazil below the average of the countries surveyed. However, 49.5% of Brazilian students have not reached the level considered a minimum in reading, which means that at best they can identify subjects from simple and familiar texts. Furthermore, only 0.5% of Brazilian students have achieved maximum reading levels, meaning that only one in 200 young people in Brazil is able to deal with complex texts and conduct in-depth analyses of such texts. More negative figures were seen in the Brazilian High School Exam - Exame Nacional do Ensino Me - 2014: of the 6.1 million students who took the exam, 529 million students who did not even understand the composition."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Although English is a culmination of this topic [8] [17] [26] [38], it has served as the basis for other languages to develop their own classifiers, such as French [14], Italian [10], Spanish [36], German [19] [41], Arabic [13] and Portuguese [9]. The automatic classifiers of text complexity have various applications, such as: teaching a second language [9], reading and understanding for readers with poor literacy [3], legal and scientific texts, and as a first step in building text simplification systems [1]. Reading proficiency studies are an area of great interest for language teaching, especially in building materials for reading and learning. The studies in this area allow us to establish a scale of the difficulty levels of texts used to evaluate students."}, {"heading": "3 Corpus and Manual Annotation on Grade Levels", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Description of grade levels and the problem", "text": "In recent years, the Brazilian government has been working to systematize education policies in an attempt to standardize curricula and content for schools and teachers across Brazil to speak the same language. Brasil8, state assessment tests (e.g. SARESP9 in the state of Sa o Paulo), and even the ENEM (National High School Exam) are attempts to steer education experts in the same direction. However, it is still not clear to teachers, especially primary school children, how such content is distributed through reading, especially when it comes to reading. Moreover, Brazil has an extremely diverse learning scenario in the same class."}, {"heading": "3.2 Corpus and selection of texts for annotation", "text": "In order to build the corpus, we are looking for pre-selected texts in terms of complexity level, using the following sources: SARESP and textbooks. We received only 72 texts, spread over five levels, from SARESP tests, as they do not cover all school years; however, they are usually used once a year; the test contains several text genres - that is, there are few informative texts; and, above all, not all texts are available online. In view of the difficulties, above all, and the importance of a large amount of data for machine learning, we turned to textbooks as our main text source. Experts chose 178 informative texts from Portuguese language textbooks, and, above all, not all, all, all texts are distributed equally at each level, a total of 250. Due to the small amount of texts that had a certain level of information, new sources that were not previously classified were included in the corpus: NILC corpus11, Cie ncia Hoje das Crianc."}, {"heading": "3.3 Annotation criteria", "text": "The first annotation grid, which is based on textbook curricula showing linguistic phenomena sorted by grade level, makes an attempt. On this basis, contact with texts aimed at school years and linguist knowledge, we have continued to improve the grid. We should stress that although school introduces linguistic elements in certain years, children can already understand and produce them long before they are exposed to them in the education system. Therefore, there is a need to link different sources of knowledge.Another challenge lies in the variety of text types that can be found in informative texts, namely: narrative, descriptive, ordering, meaningful and argumentative [4]. Such types of text have different structures, but they can still be at the same level of reading comprehension. For example, a largely ordering text can have the same level of complexity as a text that is mostly descriptive, ordering, syphilistic, and philistic."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Preliminary Experiments: using language independent features", "text": "The manual annotation process began to focus on a balanced sample of 971 texts in 5 levels of text complexity, ranging from 3rd to 7th grade, illustrated here from Level 1 to 5th grade.

For this set, we extracted the following 10 characteristics, which we call a \"simple statistical function\": Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index, average sentences per paragraph, average words per sentence, number of paragraphs, number of sentences, number of words in the text, type-token ratio, number of simple words corresponding to the dictionary of simple words for young people [6], frequency of punctuation and variety of punctuation.

There are no classifiers for nonfiction texts for close grades in Portuguese. In this article, we propose a scheme for manual annotation of texts in 5 grade levels, which will be used for customized reading to avoid the lack of interest by students who are more advanced in reading and the blocking of those that still need to make further progress.
