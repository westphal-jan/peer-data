MODEL", "text": "In the context of our interest, we assume that I = {I1,., Im} k is a set of elements belonging to the table of contents. \"emej\" is represented by actors, while U = {U1, U2,.., Un} is a set of users. Both sentences are projected onto two attribute spaces, each consisting of p and q dimensions. The first is referred to the set of characteristics describing the elements in I, C = {C1,., Cp}, while the second part of the user profile P = {P1,. Both spaces are discrete, so that each Ci and Pj can assume a finite number of values. The relationship between elements and users is expressed by a selection matrix as shown in Tab. I. The selection matrix is placed side by side on the element matrix (left side) and on the profile matrix (top). Generally, data points, which are represented by pci, are pk, which means that they are sensed."}, {"heading": "IV. APPLICATIONS IN MEDIA INDUSTRY", "text": "The model that can be used so far for different tasks. We briefly outline some of them below.Recommendations. The model can be used to propose a content for a user according to each dimension. For example, chose the dimension of the \"director,\" the system could propose directors that are most likely of interest to the user. It is also possible to combine different dimensions. For example, \"genre\" and \"year.\" In any case, the conclusion of preferences is carried out by looking at users indistinguishable, which profile information is not taken into account. In this case, we are interested in finding user profiles that might be interested in watching a new movie, the model could be of interest for each age group. Again, it is possible to combine several dimensions that are the user profile."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we have examined a preference model based on the Dempster-Shafer theory and its application to the media industry, which is an evolution of what has been done so far by introducing some elements of novelty, including the ability to include the user profile as part of the conclusion, rather than being neutral in relation to various applications and problems discussed in the previous section. There are still some issues that need to be resolved. Most important is the scalability of the model. In fact, the nature of D-S theory is inherently combinatorial, so that the search space explodes by including more elements in the overall dimension. The possibility of defining equivalence classes in terms of belief and plausibility is one way to reduce complexity, but more work needs to be done to make this solution feasible in practice. Furthermore, the model presented here needs to be validated by validating other elements within the overall dimension."}], "references": [{"title": "The netflix recommender system: Algorithms, business value, and innovation", "author": ["C.A.
