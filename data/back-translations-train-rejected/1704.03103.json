Interval methods are usually used to solve equations or optimization problems [5], but can also be used to solve set membership problems where sets are represented by subpavings [7]. The efficiency of interval algorithms can be improved by using contractors [2] or (separators [6] that correspond to pairs of contractors).This paper deals with the localization of a robot with sonar distance meters in an unstructured environment. This problem is considered difficult due to the fact that the sonar returns a measurement in the form of an impaction point within an emission cone. This specific type of measurement makes the problem partially observable. Furthermore, our environment is not represented by geometric features such as segments or images, but rather by equations that can be transmitted in a disc."}, {"heading": "2 Contractors and Separators", "text": "This section recalls the basic concepts of intervals, contractors and separators that are necessary to understand the contribution of this work.

This section deals with the localization of the robots moving with the Set-to-Set-Transform. Several authors have already investigated this problem by means of interval analysis [12, 13, 3] but in an environment made with segments. Each sensor emits an acoustic wave in its direction that propagates within half an angle corresponding to the aperture of the beam. By measuring the time delay between the emission and the reception of the wave reflected by the map, an interval [di] = [d \u2212 i] contains the true distance di to the nearest obstacle that can be reached in terms of the scope of the emission and the reception of the wave."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Separator-based techniques are particularly attractive in solving technical applications because they can handle and disseminate uncertainties in a context where the equations of the problem are non-linear and non-convex. Now, the performance of plaster methods is extremely sensitive to the accuracy of the separators, but also to the uncertainty caused by the dependency effect caused by the separator algebra. If a separator associated with the same sentence occurs several times in the separator expression, a pessimism is introduced. Therefore, it is important to factorize the subexpression with separators into a single one, which is calculated separately by a specific algorithm. Another possibility is to rewrite the specified expression in order to avoid multiple events. We have done this for the Minkowski sum A-B and Difference-B. The efficiency of these new operators and their ability to obtain an inner and outer approximation of the solution is illustrated by the problem of a robot localization."}], "references": [{"title": "Mobile robot localization by multiangulation using set inversion", "author": ["E.
