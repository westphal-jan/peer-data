From a proofing theoretical perspective, it generalizes the two main mechanisms upon which modern satellite solvers are based: the propagation of units and conflict-driven clause learning. The calculus is demonstrably solid (by simulation using a clear natural derivative calculation) and refutes the usual resolution calculations (by simulation of the usual resolution calculation), and it is shown that subderivatives in the CR are isomorphic to the implication graphs used by satellite solvers. This paper goes one step further by defining evidence for search algorithms for the CR. Familiarity with the propositional CDL procedure is [although briefly accepted] in section 2."}, {"heading": "2 Propositional CDCL", "text": "When searching in the propositional case, a satellite solver maintains a model (also known as trail) that consists of a (conjunctive) list of decision words and propagated dictionaries. Dictionaries of unity clauses are automatically added to the trail, and if a clause has only one dictionary that is not distorted by the current model, that dictionary is added to the model (which fulfills this clause), a process known as unit propagation. If the propagation of a word causes a conflict (i.e. a situation in which the dual of a dictionary already included in the model would have to be added), the satellite solver returns and removes from the model decision dictionaries that are responsible for the conflict (as well as propagated dictionaries caused by the remote decision literature) and derives or learns from it a conflict-driven clause consisting of duals of decision dictionaries that are responsible for the conflict (or the empty clause if there are no decision dictionaries)."}, {"heading": "3 Conflict Resolution", "text": "The consequential rules of the conflict resolution calculation CR are presented in Fig. 1. The unity rule propagating resolution is a chain of restricted resolutions with standard clauses as left premise and a standard clause as final conclusion. Decision letters are referred to in square brackets, and the conflict oriented clause learning rule allows to conclude a new clause consisting of negations of instances of the decision letters used to achieve a conflict (also as empty clause). A clause learning inference is intended to relieve the decision letters used by it. As in the resolution calculation, CR derivations are directed to acyclic graphs that are not necessarily tree-like. A CR refutation is a CR derivative of unrelieved decision letters. From a natural deduction perspective, a unit propagating resolution can be considered as a chain of implication iminations taking into account the unification of decision letters, while generalizing conflicts are considered in each case."}, {"heading": "4 Lifting Challenges", "text": "In the logic of the first order, the expansion of the unit can never be stopped, because, for example, there is no mapping of q structures to true or false that would satisfy all the last four clauses. However, the expansion of the unit would derive the following infinite sequence of units by successively resolving. (X) with previously derived units, starting with p clauses (a), p clauses (f), p clauses (a), p clauses (a), p clauses (c), p clauses (c), p clauses (c), p clauses (c), p clauses (c), p clauses (c), p clauses (c), p clauses (c), p clauses (c)."}, {"heading": "5 First-Order Model Construction and Proof Search", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will be able to erenie.n the aforementioned lcihsrcnlrVo leads nlrVo leads nlrVo leads nlrVo leads eid nlrVo."}, {"heading": "6 Implementation Details", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "7 Experiments", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able to assert ourselves in the region, that we are able to assert ourselves in the region, and that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able to assert ourselves in the region, that we are able to stay in the region, \"he said."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "The experiments show that its performance is promising, though not yet competitive. A comparison of the performance of the three variants of Scavenger shows that it is not trivial to link decisions within possibly non-terminating unipropagations, and that further research is needed to determine (possibly problematically) optimal initial depth thresholds and threshold incrementation strategies. Alternatively, completely different criteria could be examined to determine whether a diligent decision can be made before the spread is over. Decisions could be made when a fixed or dynamically adjusted time span elapses. The performance bottleneck that needs to be addressed most urgently in future work is backtracking and restarting. Currently, all variants of Scavenger restart are after each conflict, retaining derivative conflict-driven clauses, but discarding the scavenger construct. You need to reconstruct models from scratch after each conflict."}], "references": [{"title": "Non-redundant clause learning", "author": ["G. Alagi", "C.
