(See also8) In a way that avoids all the contradictions that occurred in previous approaches. Nevertheless, the assertion of this work that the L.P. logic of Bacchus1 also fails to achieve its primary goal of becoming the tool for describing knowledge & reasoning in expert systems and other knowledge-based systems. In Section 2, we present some simple examples of fundamental errors of this logic that exploit the counter-intuitiveness of L.P. logic. Section 3 shows a more sophisticated example that points to the weaknesses of L.P. logic. As a remedy, we propose (in a sketchy manner) a different deduction theory that takes into account the gap between the first order way of thinking (global treatment of domains) and the statistical (experimental) sciences (local treatment of domains)."}, {"heading": "2 Flaws of Theories Criticized by Bacchus and", "text": "His SolutionA number of papers dealt with representative and following problem when probabilities of events (\u03b2) were identified as degree of faith (\u03b2). Bacchus criticized the following approaches: Approach 1: (propositional logic): (see \u2192 6,7) Probability of a proposition is the probability of selecting one of these possible worlds in which this proposition applies. For example, the 90% belief that the famous Tweety fly is a prob (F is (Tweety)) = x with a probability greater than 0.9. However, such an approach does not make it easy to determine that \"most birds fly.\" Approach 2: (Probability of first order) The probability of expression: \"x.Bird (x) \u2192 F is (x) to be expressed as a prob. Bird (x) \u2192 F is lying (x). If one follows the principles of probability calculation, we obtain: Prob (x.Bird (x) F is lying (x) = Prob."}, {"heading": "3 The Flaws of Bacchus Himself", "text": "Let us point out the main weaknesses of L.P. logic and counter-event x \u00ac. Let us note the following: 1. many logical-based knowledge systems express general knowledge in terms of implications: 2. all examples of statistical knowledge representation in 1 refer to conditional probabilities instead of implications. 3. the concept of conditional probability in L.P. is not a primary, but a concept derived from \"q q\" x = [q | p] x. 5. conditional probability is not sufficient to express this missing logical construct that corresponds to conditional probability. (a construct of the form: p \u00b2 q with [p \u00b2 q] x = [p \u00b2] x = [p] x =. 5. conditional probability is not sufficient to express a statement \"in most cases where p then also implies q.\" Let us demonstrate the unsuitability of the implication for the expression of statistical knowledge. Example 1: What is the sum of conditional probabilities of a generational event and an event. \""}, {"heading": "4 A Solution", "text": "\"In order to overcome the problems mentioned above, it is necessary to find a logical construct that corresponds to the conditional probability.\" It is easy to see that imposing the interpretation of the ordinary implication as conditional probability would lead to serious problems, because: [\u03b2 | \u03b2] x = [\u00ac \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b1] x = [\u00ac \u03b1 | \u00ac \u03b2] x, which can easily lead to a contradiction. Thus, we see that divalent logic is not sufficient for our purposes. Therefore, let us introduce the logical construct that includes the following three evaluated properties: (T - = true, F = false, U = uninteresting) p: \"q\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\".U U U U U U. \"F.\" \"\" We also need truth tables for basic logical constructs. \""}], "references": [{"title": "L.p., a logic for representing and reasoning with statistical knowledge", "author": ["F.
