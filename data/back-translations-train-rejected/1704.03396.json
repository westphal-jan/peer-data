Paraconsistent logic is a class of non-classical logic that we have chosen, i.e. the relationship between the two systems is not valid in these systems. Therefore, they allow a theory that contains inconsistencies while not deriving all the approaches for constructing such systems. ([22]) The question is which is the best in the AGM model. Here, we use a paraconsistent logic called a PAC. (5) This logic is an enrichment of the logic of the LP (21) with an implication for which we consider a mode ponens2 and a deduction theorem3. In PAC, we have three values that are denoted by 1, \u2212 1 and 0."}, {"heading": "2.2 For Multi-sourceness", "text": "As the belief set K, we mean a set of suggestions that are inferred under logical consequences, i.e., K = Cn (K). Unlike AGM, however, the input is not represented by a single sentence. Following, we will specify PI and SI for the reference to the sentence and source of the input I.Also epistemic and reliability functions are used to specify the degree of credibility for beliefs and inputs. To define these functions, a value is needed for the reach of these functions. Each value sets V needs at least three elements with a given total order on them, i.e., for each x, y, x, z, V we have: \u2022 x, x, y, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x"}, {"heading": "2.3 For Non-priority", "text": "The \u2264 to V properties provide the conditions for a comparison between old beliefs and inputs in order to make a decision on a change of belief. Most work to this end merely maintains the non-priority of the revision functions discussed. [12] provides two taxonomies for classifying the non-priority functions proposed for this change; one based on the output of these functions and the other on their construction process. In the latest framework, the non-priority of any type of faith change is discussed. Therefore, we generalize our approach to meet source-sensitive functions as follows: \u2022 Based on the output: \"all or nothing\" approach; that is, it either accepts the entire input or leaves the belief unchanged. \u2022 Based on the construction: \"decision + action\"; that is, we first decide whether to accept the input or not, and then make the change."}, {"heading": "3 Source-sensitive Belief Changes", "text": "In the original Annual General Meeting manuscripts, contraction, expansion and revision are considered to be the three most important types of faith changes that happen to a state of belief in relation to an input. Contraction is defined to eliminate an existing faith and define expansion along with revision to add a new faith. The difference between revision and expansion is that the result must be consistent in the former, whereas expansion consistency is not a constraint. By changing our view from consistency to paraconsistency, motivations for adopting revision as the main type of faith change no longer have reasonable supports and motivations. As Tanaka ([26]) has investigated, revision collapses expansion through the use of paraconsistent logics in the AGM model. Therefore, it also seems very permissible to agree with this result in our multi-source environment. Consistency of beliefs within this framework cannot be considered an effective factor for evaluating it as the only one important parameter."}, {"heading": "3.1 Expansion", "text": "In fact, it is a matter of a way in which people are able to determine themselves how they have behaved. (...) In fact, it is the case that people are able to behave. (...) In fact, it is the case that people are able to behave. (...) It is the case that people are able to behave. (...)

(K \u2212 \u00ac p) However, it is possible to define it as a derivative change of expansion and contraction. (3) It turns out that if \u2212 is an AGM contraction function, then it will be an AGM revision. The original form of the Levi identity is not appropriate within our framework for two reasons. Firstly, in our multi-source environment there is no relationship between an input with proposition p and another with proposition p.) Secondly, since the final step of the Levi identity expansion is expansion, it will almost disregard our non-prioritized approach. Therefore, it should be modified in our multi-source environment to fit our proposed framework. For each input I = (p, s) we use the auxiliary notation I, so that I (\u00ac p, s) Now the process in relation to I will be modified."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced a new framework called source-sensitive belief change, based on AGM, to address three criticisms that apply to the AGM model: single-agent environment, primacy of input and consistency criterion. We specified our position in each extended topic for these criticisms, so-called multi-agent faith change, non-prioritized faith change and paraconsistent faith change. Of course, there are some similarities and relationships between our model and other proposals ([10], [23], [24] and [25]) in these areas, and there are also several motivations, characteristics and characteristics that are exclusive in the recent framework. As has been shown, the changes that we have applied to the creation of our desired model have led to persistent AGM postulates, as far as possible. However, some of the definitions we use are redefined and with very general attributes, so ways to improve them are open and need to be explored."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change: Partial meet contraction and revision functions.
