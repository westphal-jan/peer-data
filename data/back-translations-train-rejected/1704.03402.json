Traditional BI focused on data collection, extraction, and organization to enable efficient query processing for deriving insights from historical data. With the rise of big data and cloud computing, there are many challenges and opportunities for the BI. Especially with the growing number of data sources, traditional BI\\&amp;A are evolving to provide intelligence at different scales and perspectives - operational BI, situational BI, self-service BI. In this survey, we review the evolution of business intelligence systems in full scale from back-end architecture to and front-end applications. We focus on the changes in the back-end architecture that deals with the collection and organization of the data. We also review the changes in the front-end applications, where analytic services and visualization are the core components. Using a uses case from BI in Healthcare, which is one of the most complex enterprises, we show how BI\\&amp;A will play an important role beyond the traditional usage. The survey provides a holistic view of Business Intelligence and Analytics for anyone interested in getting a complete picture of the different pieces in the emerging next generation BI\\&amp;A solutions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 16:31:51 GMT  (119kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03402v1", "11 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["quoc duy vo", "jaya thomas", "shinyoung cho", "pradipta de", "bong jun choi", "lee sael"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03402"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.03402.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Next Generation Business Intelligence and Analytics: A Survey", "authors": ["Quoc Duy Vo", "Jaya Thomas", "Shinyoung Cho", "Pradipta De", "Bong Jun Choi", "Lee Sael"], "emails": ["bjchoi}@sunykorea.ac.kr", "pde@georgiashouthern.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to survive on their own without there being a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in"}, {"heading": "II.

Traditional BI", "text": "Traditional BI systems use reporting mechanisms to access transaction data stored in the data warehouse. Transaction data analysis can help us identify patterns and predict business trends. A traditional BI system consists of three separate layers, as shown in Figure 2: Presentation Layer, Application Layer, and Database Layer. Due to the three-tiered architecture, it is difficult to achieve service-level goals such as maximum response time and minimum throughput rates due to the difficulty of predicting execution times where the application layer does not know about low-leverage data storage management. Although a typical BI system can give us a predictive view of business, traditional BI systems are known to be slow, rigid, time-consuming, and requiring maintenance."}, {"heading": "B. Modern Features of Next Generation BI", "text": "1) Operational (real-time) BI: The competitive pressures of today's companies have increased the need for near-real-time BI, also known as operational BI. Operational BI aims to reduce the latency between the time of data collection and the time of data analysis. Reducing latency enables the system to take appropriate action in the event of an event. Operational BI enables companies to detect patterns or time trends via streaming operational data.2) Situational BI: situational BI allows situational awareness. Situation BI is important in companies because situations change quickly, often external business trends, affect business [2]. However, such external information, which largely comes from the corporate intranet, external vendors or the Internet, is unstructured. In addition, this unstructured data must be integrated with structured information from the local data warehouse to support real-time decision-marking."}, {"heading": "C. Data Architecture", "text": "1) Background and Challenges: The traditional architecture of business applications consists of three separate levels: Presentation, Application and Database. With the three-tiered architecture, execution time is difficult to predict due to the correlation between low data management operations and high-level processes. Therefore, technologies that allow analytical queries and business transaction queries to be performed simultaneously on the same database systems are important. Today's companies use an extraction, transformation and load model to extract data, perform transformations and load the transformed data into the data warehouse. This model relies on two types of processes that are critical to business operations: Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analysis Processing (OLAP). OLTP is used to manage business processes, such as order processing. OLAP is used to execute strategic system loads."}, {"heading": "D.

In terms of data type, there is heterogeneity in the form of metadata, master data, historical and transactional data. In the Business Intelligence study, the heterogeneity of data is also contributed by the data extraction method, which may depend on on on on on on the on-demand feeds, continuous feeds, real-time feeds, or time series."}, {"heading": "B. BI Analysis", "text": "The growing volume of data in many organizations makes cost-effective manual data analysis virtually impossible. In business, the use of data mining techniques not only addresses the volume and diversity of data, but also helps to make proactive knowledge-based decisions and improve business intelligence in general. Data mining is a broad term that includes a range of processes such as data modeling techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning in search of consistent patterns or relationships, as well as identifying some predictable information in the data analyzed from large amounts of data. [25] Machine learning uses data mining algorithms to improve predictive analysis. Machine learning techniques have become popular in BI as they handle growing volumes and types of available data, and computational processing, which is cheaper and more powerful."}, {"heading": "C. Time series forecasting", "text": "In this survey, we will discuss these dynamic decision-making techniques for time series forecasting. Description of time series data includes high dimensionality, volume and continuously evolving data. Analysis of time series data is a powerful analysis tool as it helps to answer questions such as the rate of change in user behavior over time, co-variance between the product, marketing strategies, current trends in product sales, profit monitoring, anomalies, etc., in almost all companies such as sales, production, mobile companies, hospitals, etc. 1) Machine learning in financial forecasting is of great interest to investors, as well as analyzing the current time to buy or sell shares is not an easy task as the price is influenced by many factors. We list some of the machine learning techniques from literature that are commonly used to make such predictions.

CONCLUSION", "text": "The next generation BIs, i.e. operational BI, situation BI and self-service BI, each focus on realizing the three capabilities that are becoming increasingly important in BI as the data becomes goodwill. We examined challenges and enabling technologies for the three types of BIs from a back-end perspective. We also pointed out that data governance is critical for the next generation of BIs. At the front end, we looked at data analytics methods that focus on time series forecasting and integrative data analysis. We also looked at the use case in healthcare and showed that BI and next-generation analytics can save lives. The next generation of BI & A is just beginning and there are several challenges in both the back-end architecture and front-end analysis."}], "references": [{"title": "Situational business intelligence", "author": ["A.

Traditional BI focused on data collection, extraction, and organization to enable efficient query processing for deriving insights from historical data. With the rise of big data and cloud computing, there are many challenges and opportunities for the BI. Especially with the growing number of data sources, traditional BI&A are evolving to provide intelligence at different scales and perspectives operational BI, situational BI, selfservice BI. In this survey, we review the evolution of business intelligence systems in full scale from back-end architecture to and front-end applications. We focus on the changes in the back-end architecture that deals with the collection and organization of the data. We also review the changes in the frontend applications, where analytic services and visualization are the core components. Using a uses case from BI in Healthcare, which is one of the most complex enterprises, we show how BI&A will play an important role beyond the traditional usage. The survey provides a holistic view of Business Intelligence and Analytics for anyone interested in getting a complete picture of the different pieces in the emerging next generation BI&A solutions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
