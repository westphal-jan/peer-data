In the experiments, we first examined psychological state of 64 participants and asked them to summarize the story of a book, Chronicle of a Death Foretold (Marquez, 1981). Secondly, we trained models using crawled 365,802 movie review data; then we evaluated participants' summaries using the pretrained model as a concept of transfer learning. With the background that emotion affects on memories, we investigated the relationship between the evaluation score of the summaries from computational models and the examined psychological measurements. The result shows that although CNN performed the best among other deep neural network algorithms (LSTM, GRU), its results are not related to the psychological state. Rather, GRU shows more explainable results depending on the psychological state. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) we enlighten the relationship between computational models and psychological measurements.

Kensinger et al. (2007a) found the different specificity of an event. Emotion can consolidate memory. Emotional memories are relatively unaffected and slowly forgotten because they have been rehearsed repeatedly. Negative emotions can improve memory accuracy (Ferginger, 2007b). Research showed that emotions can influence regulation (Raes et al., 2003; Fonagy et al., 2004). When an event has occurred over a long period of time, people rate the event according to their emotion when the emotional arousal reaches its peak and is at the end of the event. Moods that correspond to the current mood would be perceived more strongly, stored, retrieved, and used as information that does not correspond to mood."}, {"heading": "Chronicle of a Death Foretold", "text": "The novel was written by Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez (1981), the chronicle of an announced death, from his experience with a murder case. In a small coastal village, the Vicario brothers decided to kill Nasar with little convincing evidence that Nazar had raped her sister Angela in order to regain the honor of her family through honor killing. Although the brothers told the time, place and reason for their killing, no one warned Narsar of the threat. Full of honor, violence in indifference and false testimony, the village turned into misunderstandings when history turned into tragedy. It was studied for a long time due to the characteristics of the novel (e.g. honor killing, the indifference of the crowd, narrative style and non-continuous narrative)."}, {"heading": "Deep Neural Networks", "text": "Traditional neural networks showed strong accuracy, but had many limitations such as complexity, overpass problems. Through various studies of neural networks and hardware improvements, deep neural networks, also known as deep learning, began stacking more and more hidden nodes and hidden layers. The basic idea of deep neural networks is to find important features and then use them for prediction or classification. Recent popular deep neural networks consist of three main algorithms: CNN; Convolutional Neural Network (LeCun & Bengio, 1995); RNN; Recurrent Neural Networks as Long-Short Term Memory (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Units (Cho et al., 2014)."}, {"heading": "Transfer Learning", "text": "Transfer Learning is a technique for imparting knowledge from other tasks related to the target task (Pan & Yang, 2010), as well as human learning.

Transfer Learning is done in three steps: First, the framework learns from the source; second, the framework transfers knowledge from the source to the destination, and the last one is to learn from the destination.
