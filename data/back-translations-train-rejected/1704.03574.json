In ezcsp, the grounding tool is mapped to its syntactically legal ASP counterpart and justifies the receipt of programs. Next, the integration module performs an iterative process in which: 3 For the interested reader, we find that such a constraint can be represented even more efficiently by a global constraint supported by ezcsp.1. an ASP solver to find an answer, the A of QS; 2. a CSP-C is achieved by finding all the numerical constraints densed by A."}, {"heading": "3.2 Encoding", "text": "This section is dedicated to discussing our coding of PDDL + problems in CASP. Our approach is based on research into actions and changes and language of action (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1993; Reiter 2001; Chintabathina et al. 2005). It builds on the existing SAT-based (Kautz and Selman 1992) and ASP-based planning approaches and extends them to hybrid areas. Considering actions and changes, the development of a domain over time is often represented by a transition diagram (or transition system) that represents states and transitions between states by actions. Traditionally, actions in transition diagrams are instantaneous, and states have no duration and are described by sets of Boolean flows. Sequences of states that characterize domain developments are presented as a sequence of discrete time steps determined by integral numbers, so that step 0 corresponds to the original state in sequence."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Time, States, Fluents", "text": "The global time at which the state begins at step i is represented by the numerical variable tstart (i). Similarly, the end time is tendentially represented by (i). a flowing letter is a flowing f or its negation \u00ac f. With l, we call Boolean complement on flowing literals, i.e. f = \u00ac f = f. If f is step i at a discrete time, the encoding we write is (f, i); if \"f\" is valid, i.e. f is wrong, we write \"holds\" (f, i). Frequently, we also use \"f\" (l, i) as an abbreviation that corresponds to \"holds\" (f, i) when \"l = f\" and \"holds\" (f, i), when \"f = f = f. For each numerical flow n, we insert two numerical variables that represent its value at the beginning and end of the time step i. The variables are initial v (n) and concluding (v) n (n)."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Domain Encoding", "text": "In the following discussion, ASP variables I, I1, I2 denote the time that must be available by the following condition: Istantaneous Actions. As we have seen, instantaneous actions are characterized by a series of preconditions and a series of effects. A Boolean precondition is a condition for the truth value of l, a numerical precondition is an inequality between mathematical expressions that include combinations of numerical flows and numerical constants. Coding of a precondition depends on its type, each Boolean precondition l of an action is encoded by a negation: (l, I), precommands (a, I), notice that a separate denial is used for each precondition. To illustrate the encoding, consider an example in which an action tanks with (tk1), which represents refueling of a machine using tank 1."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Problem Encoding", "text": "The problem part of the PDDL + problem is encoded as follows: initial state. The encoding of the initial state consists of a set of rules that specify the values of the liquids in P-v at step 0, where P and v are the sets of Boolean or numerical liquids, respectively. Objectives. The encoding of a target consists of a series of denials of Boolean liquids and limitations of numerical liquids, which are achieved similar to the encoding of the preconditions of actions previously discussed. In the face of a PDDL + planning instance I, we call the CASP encoding of I. Next, we turn our attention to the planning task."}, {"heading": "3.2.4 Planning Task", "text": "Our planning approach uses techniques from ASP-based planning (Lifschitz 2002; Balduccini et al. 2006). The planning task is specified by the planning module M, which contains a selection rule of the form: \u03bb {occurs (a1, I), occurs (a2, I), occurs (ak, I.) Where a1.... ak measures are, as defined by the PDDL + specification and limits, \u00b5 allow the control over the simultaneity of the measures. In practice, planning modules often include heuristics for the purpose of increasing performance, also with regard to the plan quality. It can be shown that the plans for a given maximum time step for a PDDL + planning instance I are in a one-to-one ratio with the CASP solutions of the (I) and the M solution, which pass the validation test by VAL. The plan A encoded by a CASP solution can be obtained from the atoms of the form."}, {"heading": "4 An Example of our Encoding", "text": "In this section, we provide an encoding of a PDDL + instance (a domain and a problem instance that is also used in the experimental analysis) in a CASP program. The specific domain is described in the first subsection, then its PDDL model is given, while the third subsection is dedicated to the encoding in CASP.4.1. The generator domain is known throughout the planning community and has been a test stand for many planners. The problem revolves around refueling a diesel-powered generator that must run for a certain period of time without overflowing or drying out. This problem is interesting because the time at which the refueling action must be applied within the generation action is crucial: The fuel level in the tank must not exceed the tank capacity, so the planner must realize that the refueling action must be delayed at least X time units after the start of the generation action, but at least Y time before the end of the fuel action occurs, where Y needs to occur below the fuel instance and Y needs to occur."}, {"heading": "4.2 PDDL+ model", "text": "The PDDL domain of the generator is shown, in slightly simplified form, in Figure 6. The generated process models of the running generator. Its invariance, specified by the general condition, requires the fuel level in the generator to be no less than 0 at all times during the execution of the process. The process has two continuous effects: it formalizes the use of a fuel level (the expression (* # t 1) states that the change is continuous and linear in relation to time and increases the value of the variable generator time, which tracks how long the generator has range.Durative measures formalize the use of a tank to refuel the generator. The action has an invariant indication that the fuel level in the generator must not be exceeded and requires a duration of 10 units of time.The action has the effects of the continuous increase of the fuel level from the generator's tank."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments on PDDL+ planning domains", "text": "The idea behind it is that the idea is about a project, in which it is about a project, in which it is about a project, in which it is about a project, in which it is about a project, which is primarily about a project, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea, an idea"}, {"heading": "6 Extended Architecture", "text": "In this section, we will discuss how to extend the architecture of Section 3 to deal more efficiently with cases where validation is not successful. Specifically, we will consider a variant of the architecture of Section 5 that aims to make better use of the information provided by VAL to find a plan that is not valid, it will return information about which invariants have been violated and at what time intervals. Let us consider a variant of instance 1 of the non-linear generators from Section 5, modified so that the capacity and output level of the generator are 100 units."}, {"heading": "7 Related Work", "text": "In this section, we analyze related approaches and hybrid automats to handle hybrid systems. We start with PDDL +, then move on to CASP. Lastly, we refer to our approach to research on planning in hybrid domains based on action languages; however, PDDL + algorithms and solutions are unable to handle hybrid domains (Penberthy and Weld 1994; McDermott 2003; Li and Williams 2008; Coles et al. 2012; Shin and Davis 2005). However, none of these approaches is able to handle the full set of PDDL + features, namely non-linear domains with processes and events. Recent work includes (Bryce et al. 2015) presenting an approach based on handling hybrid domains. However, dReach does not use PDDL + features, and cannot handle exogenous events."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "PDDL + and CASP languages extend PDDL and ASP to reason with mixed discrete-continuous dynamics. PDDL + is the default language for the automated planning community, with a number of interesting areas presented as PDDL + models. In this paper, we have presented a new approach to solving PDDL + problems by encoding in CASP problems and extending the ezcsp solution architecture for planning in hybrid domains. Our solution can handle both linear and non-linear variants of domains. An experimental analysis conducted on known PDDL + domains, with some variants of our approach, other CASP solvers and PDDL + planners involved in two argumentation tasks, demonstrated the feasibility of our approach."}], "references": [{"title": "SMT-based analysis of virtually synchronous distributed hybrid systems", "author": ["K.

An experimental analysis, performed on well-known linear and non-linear variants of PDDL+ domains, involving various configurations of the ezcsp solver, other CASP solvers, and PDDL+ planners, shows the viability of our solution.
