INTRODUCTION", "text": "Shenoy and Shafer [16] presented an axiomatic system and a method for calculating conditional beliefs by local calculations. Shenoy and Shafer have shown that their framework is suitable for both Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer beliefs. In their paper, they generalize similar work by other authors that focused on the spread of uncertainty in Bayean networks [2], [14], [12] and DS beliefs [15], [7]. An important innovation of Shenoy and Shafer [16] was to separate the notion of fragmentation from the notion of conditionality. Other authors previously insisted [14], [12] that factors in Bayean networks are conditional distributions. The aim of this paper is to investigate to what extent this innovation is really significant and what impact it may have on the development of algorithms for restoring (identifying) faith networks (distribution data)."}, {"heading": "2.

HYPERGRAPHS AND BELIEF NETWORKS", "text": "On the other hand, other authors insisted on a definition of faith in a faith network. We will examine below the implications of this inconsistency. We will define an illustration of what Pr1 (A) / Pr2 (A) / Pr2 (A). In the case of DS pseudo-faith functions, this means that the operator creates a DS pseudo-faith function, so that whenever Bel1 then Q12 (A) = c \u00b7 Q1 / Q2. Both are not clearly intended for probabilities and for DS faith functions."}, {"heading": "4. HYPERTREES AND BELIEF NETWORKS", "text": "In this case, it is only a matter of time before we deal with a reduced hypertree factorization process, or more precisely, how we relate to a hypertree construction system constructed in the following way: If hk is a twig in the sequence {h1, hk} and hik its branch with a reduced hypertree factorization process, or more precisely, in the relationship to a hypertree construction system constructed in the sequence {h1, hk} and hik its branch with a reduced hypertree factorization process, or in the relationship to a hypertree construction system constructed in the sequence {h1, hk) and hik. \""}, {"heading": "5. BELIEF TREES AND HYPERTREES", "text": "Let us now look at a specific class of hypertrees: linked hypertrees with the cardinality of each hyperedge equal to two. It is easy to show that such hypertrees correspond exactly to the directed trees. Furthermore, we can conclude that any factorization in the form of connected hypertrees with the cardinality of each hyperedge equal to 2 can be restored from data of algorithms that restore faith trees from data. This does not apply, for example, to poly-trees.Algorithms that restore general faith networks from data have yet to be invented. The main obstacle to such algorithms is the poorly defined relationship between different types of representation of uncertainty and empirical data. Instead, we assume that there is a measurement value (BEL1, BEL2) that is zero if both faith distributions are identical and positive."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This paper demonstrates that evaluated hypertrees can be equally represented by faith networks, which is of particular importance for spreading the uncertainty within the Shenoy / Shafer axiomatic framework for local calculations. The simplest possible hypertree factorizations of a faith distribution can be achieved by methods of restoring the faith network structure from data, and the evaluation of hyperedges can then be performed by local calculation of marginal of the faith distribution. Another contribution of this paper is the extension of the Chow / Liu algorithm to restore tree-like faith networks for probability distributions to general type distributions corresponding to the axiomatic framework of Shenoy / Shafer."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning with CASTLE\u201d, Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to Uncertainty", "author": ["S.
