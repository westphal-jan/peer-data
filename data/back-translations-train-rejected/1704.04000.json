(x1, x2,..., xn) The domain of X is our space of discourse covered by the attribute X. We will also briefly say that X is our space of discourse.

Bacchus, in his work [2] on the axiomatization of probability theory and the logic of the first order, shows that probability should be considered as a quantifier binding free variables of the first order, just like universal and existential quantifiers. So, for example, if \u03b1 (x) is an open expression with a free variable x (\u03b1 (x) x means the probability of the truth of the expression \u03b1 (x). (The quantifier [] x binds the free variable x and yields a numerical value ranging from 0 to 1 and hitting all Kolmogoroff axioms.) Within the expression [\u03b1 (x) x x x implies x the variable x. See [2] on justification why other ways of integrating the theory of probability and first order logic or the logic of the first order fail. Also, to justify the rejection of the traditional view of probability as a function via sets, we find his notation a bit awkward, so that we are similar to the universal observation and the logic of the first order."}, {"heading": "4 A New Interpretation of Belief Functions", "text": "The empirical meaning of a new interpretation of the word \"faith\" is explained by the following examples: Example 1: Consider an example from everyday life. Buying a bottle of hair shampoo is not a trivial task on the part of the consumer and the manufacturer. If the consumer returns to the awareness that the shampoos fall into one of the four categories in which the health and health of the consumer is paramount, then this is not the case. (M) It is also suspected that the products are hazardous to health and life (with bacteria or other pathogens) that cause carcinogenic or invasive diseases."}, {"heading": "4.1 Summary of the New Interpretation", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world in which they are able to move, and in which they are able to move."}, {"heading": "5 Belief from Data", "text": "Since the DS belief function presented in this paper is defined in terms of frequentistic metrics, there is a direct possibility of calculating credibility on the basis of data. It must be assumed that we have a data set for which the measurements of type Ml were made for each singleton subset of the discourse space. In this case, for example, the results of these measurements can be associated with each object as a fixed attribute so that the actual values that occur are those for which the singleton tests were positive (i.e. TRUE). In this case, for an object, if the attribute X = A has the value X = A with A, then that object increases the count for the DS mass function m (A) (and for no other m). Whenever a statistical quantity is estimated on the basis of data, there is a certain risk (uncertainty) of invisible examples. If we assume some levels of significance, we can complete the estimate by considering the lower limits as actual estimates of the cases, and all of the remaining (doubtful) loads."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "Different interpretations of the Dempster-Shafer-Bel functions have been sought in the past.

This approach is of limited use, since not every set of lower and higher probabilities leads to Bel / Pl functions [12], thereby establishing a unidirectional relationship between probability theory and DS theory. According to our interpretation, the Bel / Pl functional pair can be regarded as a kind of interval approximation to some \"intrinsic\" probability distributions, which, however, cannot be accessed by practicable measurements and which are of interest only as a kind of qualitative explanation for the physical quantities actually measured. Therefore, another approach was to treat them as lower / upper envelopes of a certain probability density functionality [12], [8]."}, {"heading": "6.4 Inner and Outer Measures", "text": "Another approach was to treat Bels / Pl in probability structures and not in probability spaces [7]. Here, the DS rule could be justified as one of the possible outcomes of independent combinations, but no stronger properties were available. This is due to the already mentioned fact that the exclusion of empty intersections actually makes most conceivable processes dependent. Please note that according to our interpretation no such ambiguity occurs, because we not only drop empty overlapping objects, but also re-relativize the remaining ones, so that any subsequently calculated probability does not apply to the original population. Therefore, an attempt was made to drop the DS rule in the probability structures as a whole, but then it was not possible to find a meaningful rule for multi-level thinking [10]. This is a very important negative result. As the DempsterShafer theory is solid in this respect and has many useful properties (as mentioned in the introduction), it should be searched for an interpretation that corresponds to the presumed probability system, rather than an omaxial interpretation of the DS."}, {"heading": "6.5 Rough Set Approach", "text": "An interesting alternative interpretation of the Dempster-Shafer theory has been found within the framework of rough set theory, whereas we could assume that rough set theory has two different approaches. [24] Essentially, rough set theory is looking for an approximation of the value of a decision that can only be defined by another (explanatory) approach. It usually happens that these attributes are only able to provide a lower and upper approximation of the value of the decision attribute (that is, the set of vectors of explanatory attributes that support only this value of decision variables and the set of explanatory attributes of decision variables. [24] For details see texts by Skowron [24] and Grzyma la-Busse [9]). The Dempster rule of combination is interpreted by Skowron [25] as a combination of opinions of independent experts who may consider different explanatory approaches."}, {"heading": "6.6 General Remarks", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "According to Smets [26], there has so far been no adequate frequentistic interpretation of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. \u2022 In this paper, a novel frequentistic interpretation of the Dempster-Shafer theory has been found that allows for a close correspondence between belief and plausibility functions and the real data. \u2022 This interpretation fits fully within the framework of the Bel / Pl definitions and the Dempster rule of combining independent evidence that relates to this rule for the first time in DST history. \u2022 It is distinguished by the fact that the moment of measuring object properties lies behind the combination of evidence that even leads to the abandonment of some costly measurements altogether."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "I am indebted to anonymous referees who have made a significant contribution to improving the presentation quality of this work."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning with CASTLE, Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches", "author": ["S.
