We compare these descriptions to solve a cross-document event coreference task. Our com- ponent approach to event semantics defines identity and granularity of events at different levels. It performs close to state-of-the-art approaches on the cross-document event coreference task, while outperforming other works when assuming similar quality of event detection. We demonstrate how granularity and identity are interconnected and we discuss how se- mantic anomaly could be used to define differences between coreference, subevent and topical relations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:23:43 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04259v1", "Invited keynote speech by Piek Vossen at Cicling 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Invited keynote speech by Piek Vossen at Cicling 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["piek vossen", "agata cybulska"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04259"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.04259.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Agata Cybulska"], "emails": ["piek.vossen@vu.nl,", "a.k.cybulska@vu.nl"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 4.04 259v 1 [cs.C L] 13 Apr 2Keywords: event reference, event identity, event relations"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, as never before in the history of a country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in"}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "After the initial focus on entity co-referencing, there has recently been a growing interest in the field of event co-referencing resolution. Some monitored approaches to event co-referencing resolution have been proposed by Humphreys et al. [19], Bagga and Baldwin [3], Ahn [1] or Chen and Ji [11]. These methods are based on supervised learning of rich linguistic features to determine co-references in a paired model and are highly domain dependent. This is not the case for the method presented in Section 7, which is not supervised. Furthermore, this work depends on local decisions, without taking into account global event distribution at the document level. The bag event model implemented here enables us to overcome this deficit."}, {"heading": "3 Event model and data", "text": "We model events as a combination of five slots.

The actress, 33, allegedly went to a treatment facility in Malibu on Tuesday.

To be able to use information coming from event controls rather than seeking information available within discourse boundaries is a challenge for paired mentions."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments with coreference on true mentions", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 One- vs. two-step classification", "text": "The peculiarity of the implementation of the two-step approach is that the two-step approach begins with the completion of a document template and the mentions of the five document templates are strung together: actions, places, times, persons contained in a document.

In this section, we describe how to extract event data from the raw text (system mentions) and then establish an interdocumentary event correlation in a two-step approach. To extract event data from the text, we use the NLP pipeline developed in the NewsReader project. 3 NewsReader applies a cascade of semantic modules, among which: named entity recognition and classification (NERC), namedentity linking (NEL), semantic role labeling (SRL), time print recognition and normalization, time anchoring, event and entity coreference. The same entity, event or time expression can be mentioned several times in a document. The above modules interpret each occurrence separately and annotate the tokens accordingly."}, {"heading": "7 Experiments with coreference on system mentions", "text": "We evaluate the NewsReader system on the same ECB + dataset. We compare the NewsReader results with Yang et al. (2015) [34], who mentioned the best results for Event Coreference Resolution System for ECB + and who also compare their results with other systems that have so far only been tested on ECB and not on ECB +. Yang et al use a distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process (DDCRP [8]), which is an infinite clustering model that can take into account data dependencies. They define a hierarchical variant (HDDCRP) in which they first use event mentions and data within a document and the next cluster within the document cluster across documents. Their hierarchical strategy is similar to our approach with event components, in the sense that event data can be streamed across multiple sets in a document and must be collected first."}, {"heading": "8 Discussion", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "The proposed heuristics exceed the state-of-the-art system if they provide the same quality of event detection. Our approach collects component information from the complete document, rather than from the local context of the event mentions compared. We have shown that event components play a role in achieving precision and retrieval, and that their adaptation needs to be adapted to the granularity of the task. In future work, we intend to examine the event correlation in terms of topical structures and lines of action. We believe that this also contributes to creating annotated data that reflect more variation and reference ambiguity, which will result in us omitting the document creation time as a base time.7 We have omitted the document creation time as a base timeanchor because it could affect the task as the articles were published on different dates for each forward-looking event.Both the annotation of the data and the FP04 task."}], "references": [{"title": "The stages of event extraction", "author": ["D.

It performs close to state-of-the-art approaches on the cross-document event coreference task, while outperforming other works when assuming similar quality of event detection. We demonstrate how granularity and identity are interconnected and we discuss how semantic anomaly could be used to define differences between coreference, subevent and topical relations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
