In ILoCI, multimodal spatio-temporal demonstrations are presented as incrementally abstracted and generalized based on a limited number of interactions with humans. In this method, perceptibly similar approaches are abstracted through a dynamic model of the mirror system. An incremental method is proposed to learn their functional similarities through a limited number of interactions with the teacher. All concepts are jointly executed through the proposed memory capabilities of the robot in order to exploit the common structural relationships between the concepts, which not only accelerate the learning process, but also improve the ability to generalize and the contradiction between the observed demonstrations."}, {"heading": "A. Learning Phase", "text": "The most important approach of the ILoCI is an iteration cycle triggered by the emergence of a new teacher demonstration. After the perception of a new demonstration, the received sensory and motor data are fed into the subordinate module to recognize the corresponding concepts. Once the concept is recognized, the robot performs an action in response to the teacher and receives a reinforcement signal accordingly. After receiving a reward, the robot uses the observed demonstration to update or develop its memory. In contrast, in the case of punishment, other available concepts are executed until receiving a reward. If none of the former concepts in the robot's memory is appropriate for the new demonstration, a new concept is generated and consolidated in memory."}, {"heading": "III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This paper introduces a step-by-step model of learning concepts through imitation as one of the manifestations of real imitation learning. The presented algorithm learns concepts autonomously and gradually from observed multimodal spatio-temporal demonstrations, based on both their perceptible and functional properties during imitation. It abstracts demonstrations both on the trajectory and on the symbolic level, which represents a significant challenge in integrating symbolic AI and the continuous control of robots [3]. In this method, all perceptual concepts are gradually learned in a single, recurring neural network through the proposed memory sample. Functional similarities between concepts are also achieved through a limited number of interactions with the teacher. Incremental learning of acquired concepts together with memory samples allows robots to use the common structural relationships between demonstrations. Consequently, the learning process is accelerated, especially in the initial stages, and the ability of algorithms to generalize becomes."}, {"heading": "V.

To be well-accepted by humans, robots should efficiently understand meanings of their partners\u2019 motions and body language, and respond accordingly. Learning concepts by imitation brings them this ability in a user-friendly way. This paper presents a fast and robust model for Incremental Learning of Concepts by Imitation (ILoCI). In ILoCI, observed multimodal spatio-temporal demonstrations are incrementally abstracted and generalized based on both their perceptual and functional similarities during the imitation. In this method, perceptually similar demonstrations are abstracted by a dynamic model of mirror neuron system. An incremental method is proposed to learn their functional similarities through a limited number of interactions with the teacher. Learning all concepts together by the proposed memory rehearsal enables robot to utilize the common structural relations among concepts which not only expedites the learning process especially at the initial stages, but also improves the generalization ability and the robustness against discrepancies between observed demonstrations. Performance of ILoCI is assessed using standard LASA handwriting benchmark data set. The results show efficiency of ILoCI in concept acquisition, recognition and generation in addition to its robustness against variability in demonstrations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
