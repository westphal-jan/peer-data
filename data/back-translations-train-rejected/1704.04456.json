However, due to its small-scale structure, it is cult to capture such splashes in practical simulations. Simulations of detailed structures typically require the use of very small spatial discretizations, which in turn leads to high computational costs. Therefore, it is often difficult to generate living splashes in liquid simulations, as these require the resolution of the small-scale, dispersive movements that cause droplets to form and be ejected from the mass. In this paper, a new data-based syringe model is proposed that improves the visual fineness of hybrid liquid simulations of particle networks. By learning the formation of small-scale splashes from physically accurate simulations, our model effectively approaches the subnet realities that lead to the droplets generated. This allows us to create manually assisted syringe simulations without having to parameters in large-scale simulations."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "The behavior of the liquids is typical of the way in which we improve the simulation of the simulation systems: \"We have it in our hand.\" \"We have it in our hand.\" \"We have it in our hand.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\". \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \".\" \"\". \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\". \".\" \".\" \".\". \".\". \".\" \".\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \".\". \".\". \".\" \"\". \"\". \".\" \"\". \".\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \".\" \"\" \".\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \".\" \"\". \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\". \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\". \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\". \"\" \"\". \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\". \".\". \"\" \"\". \".\" \"\". \".\" \"\". \".\" \"\" \".\". \"\". \".\". \"\" \".\". \".\" \".\". \"\" \".\". \".\". \"\". \"\". \".\". \".\". \".\" \".\". \".\" \".\". \"\" \"\". \"\". \"\". \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\". \".\". \"\". \".\". \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\". \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \".\". \"\". \".\". \"\". \".\". \"\". \".\" \".\". \""}, {"heading": "3 DATA-DRIVEN SPLASH MODELING", "text": "The following section describes our data-based approach to spatter generation. The basic idea of our approach is to derive syringe formation statistics based on data from simulations that are parameterized to capture droplet formation in nature. Our definition of a spatter is a small, disjointed region of liquid material that is not globally coupled to the most important liquid volume. Therefore, we treat individual spray droplets as particles that experience only gravitational acceleration, but no other NS forces. This modeling is consistent with the secondary particle effects commonly used in films (Losure and Baer 2012).The main novelty of our approach is that it does not require manually selected parameters such as velocity or curvature thresholds to generate the spatters. Rather, it uses an astatic model and data derived from a series of highly detailed and pre-calculated simulations - our approach consists of one solution class and two components."}, {"heading": "3.1 Neural Network Model", "text": "Input to our model is a feature descriptor x-RM that contains enough information about the above manner that a machine learning model can infer whether the region in question will turn into a splash. In practice, for this binary decision \"splash or no-splash,\" we use 33 samples of velocity and level specified below. Discussion of this choice is detailed in Section 3.3. We train our models with a given data set consisting of feature vectors X = {x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xN} and the corresponding detail values L = {l2, \u00b7 \u00b7 lN}; they are generated at sites during a pre-processing phase."}, {"heading": "3.2 FLIP Integration", "text": "Our NN-based splash generation model is easily integrated into an existing FLIP simulation pipeline; we refer to the new FLIP method integrated into our splash model as MLFLIP. After the print projection step, we perform a classification of all particles in a narrow band of a cell around the surface. Those that produce a positive result evaluate our splash modes network to calculate component averages and variance, and then generate random numbers from appropriately parameterized normal distributions to update the speed of the new splash particle. All sprayers are treated as ballistic particles and do not participate in the FLIP simulation until they return to the main volume."}, {"heading": "3.3 Training Data", "text": "Our NNs require a large number of input functions that are unlikely to be applied to two resolutions. In our model, we are equipped with two models that we will apply later with our two models. We have generated the training data from a series of random starting conditions simulations that result in random starting conditions selecting the number of droplets and their starting positions and velocities. We select the ranges of each condition they select for data generation.The snapshots of the randomized sample simulations are shown in Figure 3. Note that at this stage, any available \"precise\" NS solution could be used. However, we show that FLIP itself bootstrap by using high-resolution simulations with correctly parameterized surface stresses. For training data simulations, it is crucial that it resolves important sub-network effects that are unlikely to be applied to two resolutions."}, {"heading": "4 RESULTS", "text": "This section shows that our data-driven splash model (i.e., MLP) improves the visibility of liquid simulations for two examples: a breaking dam and sultry wave simulations. The former should represent about three meters of real size, while the depleting dam is about one meter long. Our model results in a violent and detailed increase of splashes for these waves. Despite the large number of splashes, the plausibility of the entire wave simulation is worth noting."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We show that our NNs and our training process successfully learn the formation of splashes on a particular physical scale from our training data. Our model leads to improved spray fluids and thus successfully extracts the relevant droplet formation mechanisms from the pre-calculated data. So far, we have only experimented with two different spatial scales. Training data was generated independently for both scales and the neural networks were trained separately. However, we envision that our model could be expanded and trained with data from a variety of spatial scales, which could lead to a more general model applicable to a wide range of targeted real scales. In addition, other complex effects such as bubbles, capillary waves and foam could be integrated into our model in the future."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "This paper proposes a new data-driven approach for modeling detailed splashes for liquid simulations with neural networks.
