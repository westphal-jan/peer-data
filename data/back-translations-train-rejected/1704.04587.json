Proposed deep learning approach", "text": "Our reconstruction approach to the sparse data problem in PAT uses deep revolutionary neural networks in combination with any simple linear reconstruction method as a pre-processing step. Essentially, it consists of the following two steps (see Fig. I.2): (1) In the first step, a standard linear PAT image reconstruction algorithm is used, which provides an approximation of the original object including sampled artifacts. (2) In the second step, a deep revolutionary neural network (CNN) is used. Parameters of the network are trained to represent the intermediate reconstruction from the first step to an artifact-free final imaging. (2) The first step can be implemented by any standard linear reconstruction algorithm including filtered rear projection (FBP) [43], Fourier methods [50] - [54] or temporal reversal of the image [- 55] [58]."}, {"heading": "C.

Details of numerical implementation and numerical results are given in Section IV. The paper concludes with a brief summary and an outlook in Section V. V."}, {"heading": "II. PHOTOACOUSTIC TOMOGRAPHY", "text": "As shown in Fig. I.1, PAT is based on the generation of an acoustic wave by a short optical pulse. Let us use h: Rd \u2192 R to denote the initial pressure distribution, which provides diagnostic information about the patient and which is of interest to PAT. Of practical relevance are cases d = 2, 3 (see [20], [61], [62]). In order to keep the presentation simple and concentrate on the main ideas, we will consider only case d = 2 spatial dimensions. Among others, the two-dimensional case in PAT with so-called integrating line detectors [20], [47] arises. Expansion to three spatial dimensions is straightforward. Furthermore, we limit ourselves to the case of a circular measuring geometry."}, {"heading": "A. PAT in circular measurement geometry", "text": "In two spatial dimensions, the induced pressure in PAT meets the following initial problem for the 2D wave equation: 2t p (x, t) \u2212 \u2206 p (x, t) = 0 for (x, t). In the circular measurement geometry, it is assumed that the initial pressure h disappears outside the disc BR: = {x, R2, 0) = 0 for x, R2, (II.1), assuming a constant speed of sound, which is traced back to one. In a complete data situation, it is assumed that the initial pressure h disappears outside the disc BR: = {x, R2, x, < R}. The goal is to restore h from measurements of the p, which is at the border between BR.In a complete data situation, PAT exists in a circular measurement geometry in which the function h disappears from data (Ph, t) (z, t)."}, {"heading": "B. Discretization and sparse sampling", "text": "In practice, the acoustic pressure Ph can only be measured with a limited number of acoustic detectors, requiring almost complete conversion costs. The standard sampling scheme for PAT in circular geometry assumes that uniformly sampled values p [m, \u00b7]: = Ph (zm, \u00b7), for m = 1,.., M, (II.4) 4with zm: = R (2\u03c0 (m \u2212 1) / M) R sin (2\u03c0 (m \u2212 1) / M). (II.5) Here p [i, \u00b7]: [0, T] \u2192 R is the signal that corresponds to the mth detector, and M is the total number of detector locations. Of course, the signals p [m, \u00b7] must also be represented by discrete samples. However, time samples can easily be collected at a high sampling rate."}, {"heading": "III. DEEP LEARNING FOR PAT IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION", "text": "Suppose that only sparsely sampled data of the form (II.4), (II.5) are available to us. As shown in Fig. I.2, we first apply a linear reconstruction method to the sparsely sampled data (p [m, \u00b7]) Mm = 1, which produces a discrete image X (RD \u00b7 D). To reduce these artifacts, we apply an intermediate reconstruction, which returns an almost artifact-free reconstruction Y (RD \u00b7 D). How to implement such an approach is described below. Image Restoration by Neural NetworksThe task of removing artifacts can be formulated as an overarching machine learning problem."}, {"heading": "B. CNNs and the U-net", "text": "In our application, the inputs and outputs are high-dimensional vectors. Such large-scales require special network designs, in which the weight matrices are not taken as arbitrary matrices, but take a special shape that reduces their effective dimensionality. If the input is an image, Convolutionary Neural Networks (CNNs) use such special network designs, which are widely and successfully used in various imaging applications [68], [71]. An essential characteristic of CNNs is the inventory regarding certain transformations of the input. In CNNs, the weight matrices are block diagonal, with each block corresponding to a convolution with a filter of small support, and the number of blocks of different filters (or channels) used in each layer. Each block is therefore a sparse band matrix, where the non-zero entries of the band matrix determine the filters of conversion."}, {"heading": "C. PAT using FBP combined with the U-net", "text": "We are now ready to present an instance of a deep learning approach to PAT from sparse data using the FBP algorithm as a linear pre-processing step, followed by the U-net for subsampling artifacts removal. Remember that we have given sparsely sampled data (p [m, \u00b7]) Mm = 1 of the form (II.4), (II.5). A discrete high-resolution approximation Y-RD \u00b7 D with D M of the original object is then reconstructed as follows. (1) Apply the FBP algorithm to p, which yields a reconstruction X-RD \u00b7 D with subsampling artifacts. (2) Apply the U-net to X, which produces an image Y-RD \u00b7 D with significantly reduced undersampling of artifacts. Note that the first step could be replaced by another linear reconstruction method such as time inversion and another formula to CNN."}, {"heading": "IV. NUMERICAL REALIZATION", "text": "In this section we give details on the numerical implementation of the deep learning approach and present reconstruction results under different scenarios."}, {"heading": "A. Data generation and network training", "text": "For all numerical results presented below, we use D = 128 for the image size and take R = 1 for the radius of the measurement curve. For the sparse data in (II.4), we use M = 30 detector locations and discredit the pressure signals p [m, \u00b7] with 300 uniform samples in the time interval [0, 2]. In our first studies, we generate simple phantoms consisting of indicator functions of ellipses with support in the unit cube [\u2212 1, 1] 2 R2. For this purpose, we generate randomly solid ellipses E by sampling independently uniformly distributed random variables. The centers are uniformly selected in (\u2212 0.5, 0.5) and the small and large axes in (0.1, 0.2). For the formation of the network, we generate two different data sets, each from N = 1000 training pairs (Xn, Yn) N n n."}, {"heading": "B. Numerical results", "text": "We have tested the network for 50 pairs (X, Y) that are randomly generated for the training data described above. For such superpositions of random ellipse phantom, in all the cases tested, the trained network is able to almost completely eliminate the sparse data artifacts in the test images. Fig.: IV.1 shows such a result for one of the test phantom. The top line shows the actual phantom Y and the sparse data p: The bottom line in Fig.: IV.1 shows the result of the FPB algorithm, which contains heavy subsample artifacts, and the result of applying the CNN (right), which is almost article-free. The actual relative reconstruction errors of YCNN \u2212 Y-Y of the reconstruction are 0.0087% of the reconstruction, which is much smaller than the relative error of FBP reconstructions."}, {"heading": "C. Comparison of computational efforts", "text": "It is worth noting that the evaluation of CNN requires a much lower number of FLOPS than a varying or iterative minimization scheme. Applying the trained CNN for image reconstruction is then fast. In fact, an application of CNN O (FLD2), where F is the number of channels for the first fold and L describes the depth of the network, requires FL to repeat in order D and the number of FLOPS for evaluating CNN is comparable to the effort required to perform the evaluation of the forward surgeon or the secondary joint. On the other hand, for the calculation of the minimizer of (IV.1) we need to repeatedly evaluate the forward surgeon and his secondary joint. In our example, we have rated both operations 400 times, and therefore the neural network approach is orders of magnitude faster. To train and evaluate the U network we use the Keras software (see https: / / keras.io /), which is a high level application for the deep intelligence of the 68U interface."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "In our approach, we first apply a standard linear reconstruction algorithm to the sparsely sampled data and then apply a CNN trained on a range of training data. CNN evaluation involves a similar numerical effort to the standard direct FBP algorithms. Our deep learning approach has proven to be a reconstruction quality similar to the state of the art in iterative algorithms, while requiring similar computational effort as direct algorithms such as FBP. The numerical results presented can be seen as proof that the proposed deep learning approach is feasible and promising for image reconstruction in the PAT. As we have shown for the sparse data problem, it already provides a reconstruction quality comparable to the state of the art in iterative algorithms. In future studies, we will investigate and test how the approach is feasible under various real-world scenarios, including different measurement geometries, realistic phases and increased creative possibilities."}], "references": [{"title": "Deep learning", "author": ["Y.

In this approach image reconstruction is performed with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), whose weights are adjusted prior to the actual image reconstruction based on a set of training data. Our results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning approach reconstructs images with a quality comparable to state of the art iterative approaches from sparse data.
