We have proposed a nonparametric Bayesian spatial concept acquisition model (SpCoA). We propose a novel method (SpCoSLAM) integrating SpCoA and FastSLAM in the theoretical framework of the Bayesian generative model. The proposed method can simultaneously learn place categories and lexicons while incrementally generating an environmental map. Furthermore, the proposed method has scene image features and a language model added to SpCoA. In the experiments, we tested online learning of spatial concepts and environmental maps in a novel environment of which the robot did not have a map. Then, we evaluated the results of online learning of spatial concepts and lexical acquisition. The experimental results demonstrated that the robot was able to more accurately learn the relationships between words and the place in the environmental map incrementally by using the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Apr 2017 17:18:11 GMT  (700kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04664v1", "Preprint submitted to 2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

We prepared a Japanese speech signal that corresponded to the movement of the robot of the above dataset because it did not contain speech signal data.

CONCLUSION", "text": "The proposed method integrated the capture of spatial concepts in SLAM using an RBPF-based approach. In the experiments, we conducted online learning in a novel environment of the robot without an existing lexicon and a map. Experimental results showed that SpCoSLAM enhances the performance of location recognition using a speech signal in online learning methods. SpCoSLAM improved the over-segmentation problem in lexical capture by sequentially updating the language model. We believe that the inclusion of forgetting [14] and rejuvenation [26] in SpCoSLAM could further improve estimation accuracy. One of the advantages of online learning is that it can deal with changes in the environment and place names. Furthermore, we believe that the spatial concepts that the robot erroneously learns can also be corrected in spatial environments. In this way, it is possible to acquire spatial concepts that are flexible to work that we cannot expect to react to long-term spatial changes in the environment and to each other."}], "references": [{"title": "Semantic mapping for mobile robotics tasks: A survey", "author": ["I.

"abstractText": "In this paper, we propose an online learning algorithm based on a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter for spatial concept acquisition and mapping. We have proposed a nonparametric Bayesian spatial concept acquisition model (SpCoA). We propose a novel method (SpCoSLAM) integrating SpCoA and FastSLAM in the theoretical framework of the Bayesian generative model. The proposed method can simultaneously learn place categories and lexicons while incrementally generating an environmental map. Furthermore, the proposed method has scene image features and a language model added to SpCoA. In the experiments, we tested online learning of spatial concepts and environmental maps in a novel environment of which the robot did not have a map. Then, we evaluated the results of online learning of spatial concepts and lexical acquisition. The experimental results demonstrated that the robot was able to more accurately learn the relationships between words and the place in the environmental map incrementally by using the proposed method.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
