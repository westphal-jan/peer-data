Backbone Guided Local Search", "text": "4.1 Framework of Backbone Guided Local SearchIn this section we will present the framework of Backbone Guided Local Search (BGLS) for weighted MAX-SAT. In BGSL, the local search process is guided by the backbone frequency, a group of probabilities that represent the times of the solution elements occurring in the global optima. As it is difficult to retrieve the exact backbone, we will instead use the pseudo-backbone frequency that can be calculated by the approximate backbone (the common parts of the local optima).The BGLS framework consists of two phases. The first phase (sampling phase) [13] captures the pseudo-backbone frequencies with traditional local search and the second (backbone phase) receives a solution with a backbone-led local search. Each run of the local search is referred to as an experiment. Each of the two phases uses an input parameter to control the maximum attempts of the local search phase from the same algorithm (see both local phase 15)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Walksat for Weighted MAX-SAT", "text": "In Algorithm 2 we will present the Walksat for weighted MAX-SAT.

In this section, we will analyze some typical cases to examine the difference. The distance between local Optima and global Optima is defined as the number of different values of variables. To compare between different instances, this distance is normalized by the total number of variables. Sampling algorithms for local Optima are Walksat for weighted MAX-SAT, where maximum flips num is set to be 200 and the drunkenness probability p is set to 0. For each instance, this sampling algorithm was generated for 50 times and 50 local Optima. Figure 1 shows the algorithms 2: Walksat for weighted MAX-SAT input: weighted MAX-SAT input: weighted MAX-SAT input: weighted MAX-SAT-SAT."}, {"heading": "4.4 Backbone Guided Walksat for Weighted MAX-SAT", "text": "As discussed in Section 3.2, there are five random actions in Walksat. Instead of the traditional random selection, we will determine the variable values based on the frequency of the pseudo-backbone values (see Algorithm 3).The first random action is an initial assignment generation in Step 1 of Algorithm 3. The initial value of a variable can be determined by the frequency of the values; the second random occurrence occurs in Step 2.1. In the pseudo-backbone, the frequencies of the clauses fulfilled in local Optima were recorded. Consequently, the probability that each clause is fulfilled can be calculated to determine which clause should be fulfilled first."}, {"heading": "5. Experimental Results", "text": "In this section, we presented the experimental results for BGLS on weighted MAX-SAT benchmark. All codes are implemented and compiled in C + + under a Pentium IV D 2.8GHz with 1GB of memory. However, in algorithms 1, 2 and 3, we specified 4 input parameters (the trials and maximum flips of two phases, respectively). In this experiment, we use identical parameters for both phases with 50 attempts and 400 flips. Since the best heuristics (GRASP / GRASP with path linking [8-9]) for weighted MAX-SAT are tested on different experimental platforms that we performed a system conversion to SPEC. [19] The GRASP system with path linking is more than 15.69 times faster than ours (see appendix) and only some of the instances. \"Since there is no platform of R4400 in SPEC, there is no ongoing problem."}, {"heading": "6.
