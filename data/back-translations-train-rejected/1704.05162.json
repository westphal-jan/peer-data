SelfCatLeftSibling: The left sibling of the SelfCat. 4. SelfCatSightSibling: The right sibling of the SelfCat. To illustrate these four features, we consider the parse tree of the second sentence in Example (1), which is shown in Figure 1, and the discourse connecting \"ainsi.\" The SelfCat node is the \"ADV\" node in the parse tree and its parent, the left and right siblings are the \"S,\" \"\" VN explicit \"nodes.\""}, {"heading": "3.4 Data Preparation", "text": "Although the work focuses on the disambigualization of French discourse connectors, we also conducted the same experiments with English discourse connectors, which allowed us to better analyze the results and compare the performance of our model in French and English.

We also used the French treebank (FTB) [1] and the Penn treebank (PTB) [15] to preserve the parse trees of French and English texts. 6 The parse tree is the French treebank. To prepare the FDTB for our experiments, we used the French treebank (FTB) [1] to preserve the syntactic trees of the FDTB sets.

We used the standard implementation of the maximum entropy classifier available in WEKA [9] for our experiments.

Results show that the classifier can distinguish between discourse use and non-discourse use of French discourse connectors with an accuracy of 94.2% and a measurement of 86.2%, which is close to the results for English discourse connectives on the PDTB (accuracy of 93.6% and F-score of 88.9%)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Feature Analysis", "text": "To evaluate the contribution of each feature, we ranked the features based on their information gain for both languages. As Table 6 shows, the syntactic features with our datasets provide less information about discourse use or non-discourse use for French discourse combinations than for English. This seems to indicate that English discourse combinations tend to appear in more limited syntactical contexts than French discourse combinations. We also experimented with other combinations of features. We ranked the features based on their information gain and added one feature each. Table 7 shows the accuracy of the classifier for each subset of features for French discourse combinations. The differences between the accuracy features were evaluated using the Student-t test, with P < 0.05. Statistically significant increases are marked with the table, while a lack of significant increase in connectivity features is only reported with a total of 8statistical features."}, {"heading": "4.3 Per-Connective Analysis", "text": "The overall results of Table 5 showed that the characteristics proposed for English can also have precisely disambiguous French discourse connectibles. However, if we analyze the results for each connective trait, many connectives appear to be very well classified with the characteristics used; while some of them are more difficult to disambiguate. If we take as a starting point the assignment of the most likely class based solely on the Conn tract, many connectives receive statistically significant improvements with the classifier that has learned about the proposed characteristics. Table 8 shows the accuracy of the classifier for the French discourse connectibles that have achieved the greatest improvements over the baseline. Also, the differences between the precisions were evaluated with the Student-t test, with P <.05 being considered statistically significant and the lack of statistical increase indicated in the table. As Table 8 shows, the discourse for this connective discourse is very precise, the discourse can be the discourse discourse."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we have examined the applicability of the syntactical and lexical characteristics that Pitler and Nenkova [20] propose for the disambiguation of English discourse connectibles to French. Our experiments at the French Discourse Bank (FDTB) show that, although the syntactic characteristics 7 are almost as effective for French and Arabic discourse connectibles, discourse connectibles that occur less than 20 times are not taken into account. [4] The fact that the local syntactic characteristics proposed for English can be used almost as effectively for French and Arabic discourse connectivities suggests that lexicalized discourse connectivities effectively differentiate between discourse use and non-discourse use, as well as between French and English discourse habits."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank the Universit\u00e9 Paris-7 (Laboratoire de linguistique formelle) for the access to the FDTB and the FTB and the anonymous reviewers for their feedback on the work, which was financially supported by NSERC."}], "references": [{"title": "Building a treebank for French.
