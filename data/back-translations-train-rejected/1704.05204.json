Traditional experimental approaches are often expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, a growing number of research efforts employ a series of machine learning approaches to predict the subcellular location of proteins. There are two main challenges among the state-of-the-art prediction methods. First, most of the existing techniques are designed to deal with multi-class rather than multi-label classification, which ignores connections between multiple labels. In reality, multiple locations of particular proteins implies that there are vital and unique biological significances that deserve special focus and cannot be ignored. Second, techniques for handling imbalanced data in multi-label classification problems are necessary, but never employed. For solving these two issues, we have developed an ensemble multi-label classifier called HPSLPred, which can be applied for multi-label classification with an imbalanced protein source.

In order to take the properties of protein sequences more fully into account, our approach takes into account two state-of-the-art feature models: 188-dimension63 and Pse-in-One64,65,188-dimensional feature model contains eight types of physical chemical properties or hydrophobicity, normalized van der Waals volumes, polarity, polarity, charge, surface tension, secondary structure and solvent accessibility. For the components of the 188 dimension, the first 20 dimensions represent the proportions of the 20 types of amino acids, while the remaining dimensions consist of eight types of more comprehensive physical properties containing twenty-one attributes. Therefore, each protein sequence produces 188 (20 + (21) x 8) numerical values."}, {"heading": "2.4 HPSLPred: a novel and ensemble multi-label classifier", "text": "HPSLPred is an ensemble multi-line with unbalanced source code, and we are designing a more comprehensive model that we need to take care of to achieve the best possible performance.

Hybrid features model can be seen in some works, and they can achieve more accurate prediction, but it is undeniable that it contains some redundant expressions, so we are applying an uncomplicated reduction method called the Max Relevance Distance Method (MRMD66) for the dimensions."}, {"heading": "2.5 Performance metrics", "text": "There are several metrics for the problem of multi-label classification, e.g. Hamming loss, Coverage, OneError, IsError, Ranking loss and Average precision (AP).

Discussion", "text": "In this section, a series of experiments shown above will be compared with each other, and we will conclude by analyzing the value and defect of each method. From three experiments (a), (b) and (c) based on the 188D characteristic model, we will summarize three important conclusions: (1). The HPSLPred classifier integrates twelve types of basic classifiers and adds grid parameters, thereby achieving the highest AP value. (2) Mulan-based multi-label classifiers are better than classic WEKA-based single-label classifiers, proving that Mulan is an excellent work. (3). The precision of each label corresponds to its AP value, which excludes the consistency of the results. From three experiments (d), (e) and (f) based PseAAC-26D classifiers, we draw a new conclusion: There is no obvious relationship between the results of PAC and the new Ase8 results, so that an expression of them exists."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we create hybrid 350D feature-based 188D feature and all methods of Pse-in-One, transform the original multi-label unbalanced source into multiple single-label unbalanced data set-based BM method, transform single-label unbalanced data sets into single-label unbalanced data set-based SVM decision limit, integrate twelve basic classifiers based on scikit learning and match optimal parameters by grid search, search for the optimum dimension through MRMD and two round dimension reduction and finally achieve the highest AP value.
