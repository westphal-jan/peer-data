This keyless auto-theft attack will be increased as cars adopt computerized electronic devices more. To detect auto-theft efficiently, we propose the driver verification method that analyzes driving patterns using measurements from the sensor in the vehicle. In our model, we add mechanical features of automotive parts that are excluded in previous works, but can be differentiated by drivers' driving behaviors. We design the model that uses significant features through feature selection to reduce the time cost of feature processing and improve the detection performance.

ATTACK MODEL", "text": "We assume that the car has the computers on board and that these computers are connected to the Internet. The car has many embedded systems and ECUs (ECUs) that communicate via the CAN protocol (Controller Area Network). Cars today have an infotainment console that is connected to the CANBus network and is also connected to the external via channels such as USB, Bluetooth, mobile radio, Wi-Fi, etc. Once attackers gain access to the internal system, they can manipulate communication within a car based on their knowledge, which was built on CAN packets for unlocking the door by moving backwards in advance. Therefore, attackers reach the vehicle and drive without the car owner's key. Furthermore, they are able to bypass the alarm system in vehicles. If they target the vehicle, it takes some time to steal cars."}, {"heading": "IV. METHODOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We characterize the driver's driving behavior and identify drivers based on the driver's driving characteristics. Fig. 2 shows the driver verification framework based on the driver's driving behavior analysis. The framework consists of four modules: data acquisition, feature preprocessing, driver classification training and driver verification. When the driver starts driving on the road, the data is collected by the sensors in the vehicle. Feature preprocessing module converts the collected data into a new data format that can be analyzed in the next module and builds feature vectors that can distinguish drivers. Driver classification training module trains the machine learning algorithm using the feature preprocessing module. We use Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN and MLP that have demonstrated high performance in previous work."}, {"heading": "A. Data Collection", "text": "1) CAN data extraction: The data is processed from the CAN data of the vehicle. This research uses the On Board Diagnostics 2 (OBD-II) and CarbigsP as OBD-II scanners for data acquisition. Fig. 3 is the screenshot of the data extractor used. The current vehicle has many measurement sensors and control sensors, so the vehicle is managed by the electronic control unit (ECU) therein. ECU is the device that controls parts of the vehicle, such as the engine, automatic transmission and anti-lock braking system (ABS). OBD refers to the self-diagnosis and reporting capability by monitoring the vehicle system in relation to the measurement and failure of the vehicle. The data is recorded every 1 second during the drive. We collected 51 features through the OBD-I.2) Experiment setting: We extracted the driving data from a current model of the KIA Motors Corporation in South Korea."}, {"heading": "B. Feature Preprocessing", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move around without being able to achieve their goals, which means they will not be able to achieve their goals, and they will not be able to achieve their goals."}, {"heading": "C. Driver Identification", "text": "1) Algorithm Selection: In the driver identification phase, we look at the algorithms that perform well in previous work, such as the decision tree, the random forest, the closest neighbor algorithm (KNN), and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The decision tree is the classification algorithm that recursively divides the data into small pieces relative to the attributes of the trait that guarantees the highest information gain. The decision tree has advantages and disadvantages. It is easy to interpret, so it is intuitively appealing. However, it has a relatively low accuracy than other classification algorithms. The random forest is a learning method that consists of many decision trees. The random forest corrects the decision tree overpass problem. The random forest has more complexity than the decision tree, but it has a high accuracy than the other classification algorithms."}, {"heading": "D. Driver Verification", "text": "The Authorised Driver is detected by classification algorithms and the unauthorised driver is not. On the basis of the classification model, which has been trained by authorised users, we test whether the user is classified in the predefined classes, e.g. Authorised Drivers, or not. The testing process is carried out on the basis of the similarity between new data samples and predefined classes. As we test users every second, we can derive the classification accuracy for a time slot. We need to set the threshold of similarity and issue a warning. The threshold is the minimum accuracy generated by the algorithms trained on authorised drivers. If the similarity measured by all algorithms exceeds the threshold, the driver is verified as an authorised driver. Otherwise, the server connected to the vehicle sends a warning message to the owner or the vehicle control centre to protect against robberies. As shown in Fig.10, we have set the detection value for each driver to a total of 97, the detection level for traffic detection is lower than the threshold for the other."}, {"heading": "V. DETECTION SENSITIVITY TEST", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Real-time detection", "text": "To quickly detect and notify the user in the event of a car theft, we need a real-time detection system. We tested our system by varying the size of the data input for driver detection training. For quick detection, the window size should be short, but for reliable detection it should be long. However, we checked when detection performance becomes reliable depending on the road types and detection algorithm types, as shown in Fig. 11. This time sensitivity test can also be used to find an optimal accuracy value that compensates for more than two conditions. We notice that the multi-layer perceptron and KNN algorithms are not reliable in the initial stages of detection. Over time, performance becomes reliable. The similarity-based method requires enough data to identify the driver, but the algorithm that works on performance by determining thresholds based on only one characteristic."}, {"heading": "B. Feature dependency", "text": "We compare the accuracy of our feature set with the feature set of previous work. We also compare the feature set with the original features and the feature set with the statistical features. Features used in previous work are the accelerator, brake pedal, steering wheel, vehicle speed, engine speed, gearbox, throttle position and coolant temperature of the engine. Table IV shows the comparison of the accuracy with other feature sets. Our feature set shows a much higher accuracy than the feature set used in previous work. We can significantly improve performance by adding statistical features. We diversify the feature set and increase accuracy by feature processing statistical features generated for a reasonable size of the sliding window."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our experiments have shown that the data from the vehicle network, including \"Long term fuel trim bank1,\" \"Transmission oil temperature,\" are important for identifying drivers, and these characteristics, which reflect driving behaviour, are difficult to deflect because the driver cannot manipulate these data. We have found the optimal size of the sliding window. The size of the sliding window plays an important role in reducing the data resource and increasing accuracy. The size of the sliding window is set to 60 to balance time costs against accuracy, suggesting that it will take 60 seconds for the owner to receive the burglar warning. For future research, we will first get more people to participate in experiments to improve the universality of our model. Second, our research can be applied not only to driver authentication, but also to the facial-out method."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This work was supported by Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd.
