These mathematical properties are also of great importance for a better understanding of the models and approaches with which objects can be compared - similarly, semantic metrics will also be analysed taking these mathematical properties into account. We have also introduced that interestingly, and despite the strong differences between the various models presented, several significant initiatives have been taken to unify the cognitive models.

The information content is the cornerstone of information theory measures, and can therefore be used to take several knowledge-based measures based on corpus-based information.

Indeed, with more than 4.5 million Articles53 providing free access to text definitions in many languages that are interlinked and linked to structured categories54, Wikipedia is a stimulating playground for scholars involved in computer linguistics. Several Wikipedia-based initiatives have been proposed to evaluate the semantic linkage between words or Wikipedia topics (sometimes called concepts)."}, {"heading": "3.8.

Such comparisons are most often used to assess the relevance of the use of an alternative in a particular application context in terms of a number of criteria - in our case, the alternatives are the measures. Semantic measures can be evaluated in terms of theoretical or empirical properties. On the basis of these assessments, a comparison is made possible by finding a way to (i) compare the values of the properties considered and (ii) aggregate these comparisons, underlining the strong dependence that exists between the criteria to be considered for the assessment and the conclusions that can be drawn. In fact, as we will see in this chapter, it is important to understand that there is no best semantic measure in absolute numbers. There are only measures that exceed others under certain conditions. Although this does not prevent specific measures from exceeding other measures in most (experimental) conditions, it will be clear that measurement performance over these conclusions will be difficult."}, {"heading": "96 CHAPTER 4. EVALUATION OF SEMANTIC MEASURES", "text": "Considering that the evaluation of the metrics can only take into account specific aspects before comparing a number of alternatives, a user looking for a metric must be careful to analyze his needs carefully.

As we have seen in defining semantic measures, the quantities estimated by semantic measures (similarity, kinship, etc.), even if they may be intuitive, are today only weakly characterized by abstract terms - compared to quantities commonly measured in other fields, such as inertial mass in physics. Moreover, formal definitions, as emphasized when semantic measures are introduced in Chapter 1, may only be taken into consideration if a system of formal definitions is accepted and canted and adopted by the various researchers studying this general topic."}, {"heading": "4.2. CRITERIA FOR SEMANTIC MEASURE EVALUATION 97", "text": "Leaving aside as much philosophical considerations as possible, one can say that concepts are in our minds and that there are as many true values of semantic metrics as conceptual representations of the comparative concepts that they are trying to grasp. This is generally evaluated by analyzing human expectations of semantic similarity / kinship / etc., as well as by taking into account averaged expectations of their values, i.e. comparing metrics with consensual values of the pairs of words that have been placed by humans on a specific scale, e.g. 0-4 - several datasets of this kind are introduced in Section 4.3.2.

EVALUATION OF SEMANTIC MEASURES", "text": "Accuracy and precision can be used to estimate the performance of a measurement according to the expected results. As we said earlier, these results are valid only within a very specific assessment framework - depending on the data set, measurement parameters and resources (text corpora, knowledge base, etc.) that are taken into account. However, these criteria alone may not be sufficient to analyze measurement performance. For example, most of the time no one will be able to ensure that expected results flowing into a particular data set are not affected by uncertainty - and that they will be the same if the benchmark is achieved with other participants. Therefore, instead of taking into account only the measurement that performs best according to specific expected results (provided by humans), most system designers will prefer to use a simply satisfactory measurement that would still ensure good performance out of revenge, even if human ratings are slightly different. Imprecision and variability in human assessments, as well as the human interference that can support this process, can influence the expected outcome."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Computational complexity", "text": "The computational complexity of semantic measures is of great importance in most applications. In fact, given the increasing amount of data sets processed in semantic analysis (large body of texts and knowledge bases), this aspect is usually crucial for the concrete use of semantic measures. As an example, lowering expectations of measurement accuracy can reduce the final performance of a system, although the use of a measurement with a strong computational complexity can simply prevent its use, e.g. that information retrieval systems often depend on semantic measures taken along the way.

Moreover, and this is a critical point that will be discussed below, these properties play an important role in finely characterizing the semantics of the measurements, i.e. the meaning of the results that the measurements produce."}, {"heading": "4.2.4 Semantics", "text": "The importance (semantics) of the results obtained by a measurement must be carefully taken into account when selecting a measurement variable, which is defined by the assumptions on which the algorithmic design of the measurement is based, some of which can be understood by the mathematical properties of the measurement variable, the others by the cognitive model on which the measurement is based, semantic similarity in use, and semantic evidence. As seen in Section 1.3.1, the semantic evidence taken into account by the measurement defines its nature and hence its general semantics (e.g., the measurement evaluates semantic similarity, kinship, etc.) - it therefore largely influences the results. However, it is difficult to finally compare measures with the semantics they carry.

Central to this quest is to give machines the ability to estimate the likeness or similarity between things in the way human beings estimate the similarity between stimuli. In this context, this book focuses on semantic measures: approaches designed for comparing semantic entities such as units of language, e.g. words, sentences, or concepts and instances defined into knowledge bases. The aim of these measures is to assess the similarity or relatedness of such semantic entities by taking into account their semantics, i.e. their meaning \u2013 intuitively, the words tea and coffee, which both refer to stimulating beverage, will be estimated to be more semantically similar than the words toffee (confection) and coffee, despite that the last pair has a higher syntactic similarity. The two state-of-theart approaches for estimating and quantifying semantic similarities/relatedness of semantic entities are presented in detail: the first one relies on corpora analysis and is based on Natural Language Processing techniques and semantic models while the second is based on more or less formal, computer-readable and workable forms of knowledge such as semantic networks, thesaurus or ontologies. Semantic measures are widely used today to compare units of language, concepts, instances, or even resources indexed by them (e.g., documents, genes). They are central elements of a large variety of Natural Language Processing applications and knowledge-based treatments, and have therefore naturally been subject to intensive and interdisciplinary research efforts during last decades. Beyond a simple inventory and categorization of existing measures, the aim of this monograph is to convey novices as well as researchers of these domains towards a better understanding of semantic similarity estimation and more generally semantic measures. To this end, we propose an in-depth characterisation of existing proposals by discussing their features, the assumptions on which they are based and empirical results regarding their performance in particular applications. By answering these questions and by providing a detailed discussion on the foundations of semantic measures, our aim is to give the reader key knowledge required to: (i) select the more relevant methods according to a particular usage context, (ii) understand the challenges offered to this field of study, (iii) distinguish room of improvements for state-of-the-art approaches and (iv) stimulate creativity towards the development of new approaches.
