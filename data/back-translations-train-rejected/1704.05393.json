To this end, the Opinion Research Institute deals with the arithmetical treatment of polarity, sensitivity and subjectivity in texts. However, the opinion is generally context sensitive [24], which means that the accuracy of sentiment classification can be influenced by the products to which it is applied."}, {"heading": "2 Review Adherence to Typical Terminology", "text": "We want to prove that positive reviews, as opposed to negative ones, generally correspond more closely to the emerging terminology of the entire review collection, and this will provide us with a form of alternative polarity detection: in fact, we could estimate the relative polarity of a review by measuring its conformity with domain terminology. As a meaningful comparison with terminology requires a considerable piece of text, the proposed approach best applies to a number of reviews. Here, we describe how the domain terminology is extracted and define a measure of how a text matches such terminology."}, {"heading": "2.1 Extracting the Terminology", "text": "The terms we use in this context are, in fact, very different (e.g. \"monotonous\" in the mathematical domain).The identification of this term is important for two main reasons: i) avoiding these irrelevant terms (such as \"the,\" in \"the...\") have a weight in the calculation of adherence; ii) knowing which key terms are more relevant in a number of texts; and terminology is agnostic in a domain and language, with the advantage that it is not based on domain and linguistic resources."}, {"heading": "2.2 Adherence Definition", "text": "The match (adh) of a document d with a terminology T is defined as: adhT (d) = | [[t | t] comes in d {t} | [t | t] in d} | (4) It represents the fraction of the terms in document d that belongs to the terminology T. This value will typically be much smaller than 1, since a document is likely to contain many non-substantive words that are not part of the domain terminology. However, the specific value of the match is of little interest to us: We show how more matches tend to be more positive than those with lower values of match, using the value only for comparison and not on an absolute scale."}, {"heading": "3 Datasets", "text": "The first data set consists of a collection of reviews from the booking website, between June 2016 and August 2016. The second data set contains reviews from the Amazon website and it is a subset of the data set available at http: / / jmcauley.ucsd.edu / data / amazon, which were previously used in [14,15]. We also used a contrasting data set to extract the domain terminology.Booking Dataset. For the booking record we had 1,135,493 reviews, which relate to 1,056 hotels in 6 cities. We only took into account hotels with more than 1,000 reviews, in each language. For each review, we focused on: - a real value given to the hotel by the reviewer, at the interval [2,5,10]; - posContent: a text describing the hotel pros; - negative data set: a text describing the hotel accounts; - the name of the hotel that refers to."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments and Results", "text": "Each record D is divided into categories Ci. Each category contains elements that we represent by the set of their ratings Ij. When we conduct experiments on D, we extract the terminology of each category Ci (TCi). Then we calculate adhTCi (r) for each r-Ij-Ci (r is the individual rating).For the Amazon record, Ci are the product categories, while Ij's are the products (represented by their ratings).For the booking record, Ci are the hotel categories, while Ij's are the hotels (represented by their ratings).We conducted experiments with and without ratings. The latter was taken into account to avoid bias: ratings with the highest ratings are over-represented in the data set, so the calculation of the terminology can be distorted into positive terms. Therefore, we randomly selected the same number of reviews for each Ci and for each rating."}, {"heading": "4.1 Adherence Informativeness", "text": "An initial analysis examines whether there is a relationship between adherence to ratings - introduced in Section 2 - and the rating associated with each rating. Amazon Dataset. For each product category, we extract the reference terminology by balancing all ratings belonging to that category, for the appropriate language. Then we calculate the adherence value for each product category. To show the results in a meaningful way, we group ratings into 5 containers, depending on their rating, and calculate the average of adherence values in each waste bin. The results are shown in Figure 1. The figure shows a line for each product category. Overall, it highlights that higher adherence ratings imply better alignment with the reference terminology."}, {"heading": "4.2 Good Opinions, Higher Adherence", "text": "Interestingly, the text of each review in the Booking Dataset is conveniently divided into positive and negative content. Therefore, we conduct an additional experiment by taking into account only positive and negative parts of the reviews. For each city, we group positive and negative content of the reviews and calculate the compliance value for each positive and negative part taking into account the reference terminology. Finally, we calculate the compliance values according to the review containers. The results are shown in Figure 5 for the unbalanced dataset. In the chart, we specify two lines for each city: the fixed (dashed) lines are obtained by taking into account the positive (negative) content of the reviews. The same color for fixed and dashed lines corresponds to the same city. We perform the same calculation by taking into account a balanced dataset (Figure 6). Both charts underline that there is a clear separation between the fixed and dashed lines. In particular, the average compliance, taking into account positive content is good for most of the containers (Figure 6)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Extension to Different Languages", "text": "The experiments described so far were conducted using a subset of reviews in English taken from the original booking data set, which also includes other languages. To further evaluate the validity of the metric, we selected two additional review sections in Italian and French. For each subset, we drew two charts, the first taking into account all the review content, the second taking into account the separation between positive and negative content. For these experiments, we considered unbalanced containers due to the limited number of reviews available in each language. The results are confirmed in Figure 7. Essentially, in both cases, the higher the score, the higher the adherence to the overall text is (Figure 7-a and Figure 7-c). Similarly, the charts in Figure 7-b and Figure 7-d show a clear separation between positive and negative adherence values when the score increases."}, {"heading": "4.4 Language and Domain-Agnostic Reviews Aggregation", "text": "This year, the number of people registered in the EU moving to the EU has fallen by more than half compared to previous years.

In view of an element (either of a hotel or a product), we look at the terms contained in the positive sentence and in the negative sentence (last and first container, with Kbins = 10), which can also be found in the extracted terminology. For each term, we calculate the value of the term frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf) (in this case, tf is the term frequency within the container, i.e. the number of reviews that contain such a term), sort the terms accordingly and select the first 20 terms for the positive and negative sentence. Then, we remove the two terms to identify the most discriminating ones. Table 11 shows the terms that are extracted for two Amazon products. After extracting the terms for each element, we calculate their frequency within an entire category.
