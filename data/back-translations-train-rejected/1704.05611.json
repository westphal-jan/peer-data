Modelling Tamil syntax and morphology using TAG is an interesting problem which has not been in focus even though TAGs are over 4 decades old, since its inception. Our research with Tamil TAGs have shown us that we can not only represent syntax of the language, but to an extent mine out semantics through dependency resolution of the sentence.

However, our research with Tamil TAGs has shown us that we can not only represent the syntax of language, but also, to some extent, work out the semantics by dissolving the dependence of the sentence. However, to demonstrate this phenomenal property, we need to analyze Tamil language sentences using TAGs that we have developed, and by parsing we obtain a derivative that we can use to resolve dependencies and thus prove the semantic property. We use an in-house pseudo-lexical TAG diagram parser; an algorithm given by Schabes and Joshi (1988) to generate derivatives of sentences. We do not use statistics to classify ambiguous derivations, but use them all to understand the short Tamil relationship that Shabes and Joshi (1988) have."}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "TAGs are one of the main motivations for researching TAGs, both linguistically and semantically, and the phenomena are now presented in many formal forms. Contrary to Chomskian formalisms, the elementary objects manipulated by TAG are trees. Such structured formalisms have properties that directly relate to a strong generative capacity (structural descriptions) that are more linguistically relevant than string sentences (weak generative capacity). So we call TAGs a tree-generating system that has properties that directly relate to a strong generative capacity. The sentence of all trees derived in an object language is the object language. Hence, to describe the derivation of an object language, we will need to know about \"derivative trees.\" The derivative trees are important both syntactically and semantically. TAGs also have some interesting linguistic properties."}, {"heading": "2. Derivation Structures in TAG", "text": "This example was taken from Joshi and Cockroach (1997). Fig. 3 illustrates the derived tree for the above sentence, but this tree does not provide any relevant information on how it can be constructed. To this end, we define the derivative tree for the same sentence. Let us refer to Fig. 4, where the necessary elementary trees are needed to derive the derivative. Note: The trees are initial trees and the \u03b2 elements are auxiliary tree species. This convention will prevail whenever reference is made to TAG trees. Fig. 3 shows how the process of constructing a derivative is illustrated as an example of how to achieve a proper derivative of TAG. All elementary trees in Fig. 3. are properly and completely lexicalized mapped with each elementary tree. Thus, each tree is mapped with at least one anchor node.The roots of all derivative trees are characterized by the name of an S-type child."}, {"heading": "3.
