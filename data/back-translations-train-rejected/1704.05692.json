INTRODUCTION", "text": "In all metropolises, people rely on buses as a means of transport. Commuters are increasingly using public transport to get to their workplaces or study places, which places a high burden on bus companies, which in turn can cause bus connections. Unequal distances between buses are reduced by various factors such as congestion, open bridges and exits. Furthermore, passenger satisfaction is reduced by full bus connections."}, {"heading": "2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION", "text": "In this section, we will outline some basic definitions that are needed to gain a better understanding of the problem definition and the proposed model, as well as common service quality and reliability characteristics that the proposed model provides insight into."}, {"heading": "2.1 Preliminaries", "text": "This year, he has been able to put himself at the top, in the way that he is able to put himself at the top, in the way that he is able to put himself at the top."}, {"heading": "3. PROBLEM DEFINITION", "text": "The simulated R-net 400 bus line consists of 12 buses, each of which is driven on two specific routes, from the Leiden terminal to the south (A-direction) to the Zoetermeer and north (B-direction) in the opposite direction. Each journey consists of 11 stops, including terminals. Departure times are only made to and from the Leiden terminal. Bus traffic is closed to this bus line, so only these two journeys are made by these 12 buses. This is because they are part of the R-net concept2, which only allows these specific buses to travel certain itineraries.In order to create a reliable bus line, there are some important factors that need to be optimized. In this work, the R-net 400 bus line is simulated and provides insight into some of these factors. Two main components of customer satisfaction are waiting time and seat availability [14]."}, {"heading": "Waiting time", "text": "The waiting time is mainly determined by the punctuality and regularity of the bus. \u2022 Punctuality: Punctuality is normally considered to be punctuality. \u2022 Punctuality shifts due to any deviation from the scheduled arrival time at a stop. \u2022 In this paper, the term punctuality is used as a reversal, so that an increase in punctuality defines a greater deviation from the timetable. This can be calculated for one stop or all stops of a line. For example, for a stop vi we can calculate the average (departure) punctuality Q-i on a journey as follows: Q-i = ki-j = 1 stop, j-jedi, jki (2) where: ki: number of buses departing from the i Jedi stop, j: scheduled departure time at the i stop of the vehicle jDacti, j: actual departure time at the i stop, j: actual departure time at the i stop of the vehicle jDacti, j: actual departure time at the jDacti stop, j: actual departure time at the jedi stop, but does not show whether the vehicle is too late or whether it is too late."}, {"heading": "Seat availability", "text": "The availability of seats is determined by the net result of passengers boarding and disembarking the bus. Average occupancy of the bus O-i after leaving stop i can be calculated as follows: O-i = ki-j = 1 i-x = 0 POUTx, j-P INx, jki (4) where: ki: number of buses departing from stop i P INx, j: number of passengers boarding bus j POUTx at stop x, j: number of passengers getting off the bus at stop x All measures are determined by travel time, length of stay, number and type of buses. We will return to these measures later in the formulation of our simulation model. The question of optimising customer satisfaction is a multifaceted problem that involves optimising waiting time and seat availability, which means that punctuality and regularity under the constraints of seat availability, travel time and length of stay must be optimised."}, {"heading": "4. RELATED AND PREVIOUS WORK", "text": "This section discusses previous work on the simulation of discrete events and agent-based modeling in public transport and presents the combination of both modeling approaches in related areas."}, {"heading": "4.1 Discrete-event models", "text": "Discrete event simulation models the operation of a system as a sequence of discrete events in which the state of the system changes [12]. Each event occurs at a specific point in time and marks a change in the state of the system. Between events, no change in the state of the system is assumed, so that the simulation clock jumps to the time of the next event. [13] a discrete event simulation for dynamic transit operations was introduced. This model is based on a mesoscopic traffic simulation that allows the modeling of operational dynamics. It is used to design control strategies for high-frequency bus lines, as in our work. A downside of its approach is the lack of a definition of microscopic behavior and a centralized approach. Global behavior is defined by flowcharts, typically with stochastic elements [2].The difference from agent-based simulation is that microplanes \"have no intelligence,\" so their behavior is aggregated."}, {"heading": "4.2 Agent-based models", "text": "The use of agent-based models requires a decentralized nature of the problem, where each agent behaves according to his objectives within his specific environment, based on input from that environment. [7] These behaviors usually follow simple rules, but behavior can also be defined as more complex. This decentralized approach differs from the centralized approach of discrete event simulation. There is no definition of global system behavior, but it results from the actions and interactions of agent-based models that were previously used to model passenger behavior when choosing public transportation and the effects of infrastructure investment and policy changes. [6] Here, agents base their individual decisions on cost, time, comfort and social norms. The simulation examines the departure time and choice of passengers. However, this model is largely passenger-based and examines their choice for public transportation, where our method considers the impact on a particular bus line."}, {"heading": "4.3 Multi-model approaches in other domains", "text": "The combination of discrete event simulation and agent-based modeling arises in our work using the Anylogic tool, which has been used to create several models in different areas, for example, to analyze the performance and performance of data centers [11], the outbreak response of immunizations [4] and the pedestrian flow at airport checkpoints [8].In these systems, discrete event simulation is used to record the evolution of the changing system over time. At the points in time when events occur, behavior is defined by the behavior of individual agents, resulting in a hybrid model. These models show that capturing the complexity of a real situation in a model while maintaining the simplicity of the model sometimes requires a combination of different paradigms, which is why this multi-model approach is also applied in our work."}, {"heading": "5. DATA SETS AND PRE-PROCESSING", "text": "Before going into detail, it is useful to first describe the data used to create the model, which gives an insight into some of the model limitations and assumptions made. In addition, we describe the steps that are taken to pre-process the data sources used."}, {"heading": "5.1 Data sets", "text": "We examine several internal and external data sources. Most data sources influence travel time or dwell directly or indirectly. Not all data sources are used in the model, as some are not suitable or incomplete. Each of the data sources considered is discussed and specified as to whether they are used.5.1.1 Internal data sources Three weeks of data from the R-net 400 bus line are used for the simulation. According to domain experts, these weeks are identified as standard weeks, so that these weeks exhibit normal passenger behavior, no detours or other rare events on this bus line. As mentioned, the bus line is a closed system of 12 buses operating independently."}, {"heading": "Bus log", "text": "Initial bus logging data is provided as Excel data files containing historical events logged by the bus information systems. Several events are logged by these bus logging systems, the most important of which are listed in Table 1 with their associated data fields. \u2022 However, the events in which the door is opened and the door closed are located within the time in which a bus is within the GPS radius of a stop. \u2022 The KAR event requires a little more explanation. All traffic lights on the route this bus travels are equipped with a short-range radio (Korte Afstands Radio (KAR) in Dutch). As a bus approaches a traffic light, a radio signal is sent from the bus to the traffic light and a \"received message\" is returned by the traffic light. At this point, the traffic light system tries to give priority to the bus based on some rules set by the traffic light policymakers. Once the bus has passed the traffic light, a message is sent by the bus to indicate that the traffic light has exceeded the time."}, {"heading": "Passenger data", "text": "Passenger data comes from the automatic check-in and check-out systems that are located on each bus. On boarding, passengers check in and on disembarkation, they check out. These data are stored separately, but linked to an ID. This data source is used in our simulation and combined with the other data sources."}, {"heading": "Bus schedules", "text": "Another internal data source that is used is the bus timetable. Bus timetables are a table with trip Ids and stop Ids. These tables show at which stop and at what time a bus should be."}, {"heading": "Bus circulations", "text": "In addition, a list of bus sightseeing tours is used. These sightseeing tours are lists of bus sightseeing tours for a specific bus pass, which indicate which trips a bus should make during the day.5.1.2 External data sources There are many external factors that determine the travel time on buses. Factors such as congestion, construction sites, open bridges, and even the weather all influence the travel time. Some of these factors may even be strongly correlated, such as construction sites and congestion."}, {"heading": "Road works", "text": "In case of road works, the bus company will be informed and the buses may be diverted. Stops can be skipped or the entire journey changed. This is a very complex situation that does not occur in our data set, and that is why we have chosen to ignore this factor."}, {"heading": "Congestion", "text": "Actual congestion information is available through the National Road Traffic Database (NDRT) 3, but unfortunately it is mainly concentrated on motorways and most of our bus routes are not covered. There is some historical congestion information based on mobile phone data on Google, but unfortunately this data is not available to third parties, so this data source is also omitted."}, {"heading": "Open bridges", "text": "There is a bridge on the route studied. Open bridges can have a significant impact on travel time. In the NDRT there is also information about open bridges. The bridge on our route is known to open frequently at peak times, but unfortunately the bridge recognition system has not functioned properly in recent months and no data is available, so this data source is also missing. We can conclude from available data sources that we do not have enough destination sources to predict travel time, but we can look at the dwell time forecast as we assume that this is mainly caused by passengers boarding and disembarking at stops. Therefore, in our simulation we used travel time as a given factor and scanned it using historical data. Next, we describe how travel time is reached."}, {"heading": "5.2 Pre-processing", "text": "The data sources used are analyzed in their own way and combined to form an overall log that contains all the information about each journey. Excel files with passenger check-ins and check-outs are evaluated to extract counts for each of the stops, this is combined with information from the bus log when the bus is at a stop. From the bus log, arrival and departure times can be calculated at stops. Coordinates of the bus log are converted from the used Rijksdriehoek coordinate system (AME-7) into our simulation coordinate system World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84), so that we can plot them later in our simulation. In addition, the bus log data is combined with the bus timetable to calculate punctuality or circulation."}, {"heading": "6. APPROACH", "text": "In this section, the modelling decisions taken and their implementation are described. First, a global overview of the model is given, then the modelling of passenger growth is discussed, then the visualisation of the model is explained and some of the model assumptions are discussed."}, {"heading": "6.1 Model overview", "text": "We start by creating a model to simulate a regular working day. Bus routes are plotted on a map using the stop coordinates of the individual journeys and defined segments in between. This simulation is supposed to run one working day from 5: 00 in the morning to 1: 00 the next day. Within this time frame, all daily journeys on this line take place. Buses are generated using discrete event simulation. The generation time is based on bus traffic. Buses are placed at the coordinates of the first stop, so that the standstill is not shown. Passengers are then generated by discrete event simulation. We know the distribution of passengers who have travelled on specific journeys from our data. On high frequency bus routes like ours, passenger arrival rates generally follow the Poisson distribution [5, 3]. We have therefore modelled the distribution of passenger arrival rates so that the arrival rates are determined as in Equation 5.Bij, the arrival rules."}, {"heading": "Bus agent", "text": "After creating bus agents, the behavior of the bus agent is determined in the form of a state diagram in Figure 3. The blocks are programmed according to the following rules: \u2022 Stop: If the bus is at the initial stop of the journey, the bus is held until the scheduled departure time of the journey. \u2022 (Un-) Loading: If not at the initial stop, the bus, depending on the passengers, will depart and unload simultaneously from the first stop. At the first stop, the bus will only load the passengers and at the last stop, the bus will only unload. In these steps, the bus agent interacts with the passengers. A message is first sent to the passengers who are currently on the bus. If the stop is at one of the stops, the bus will be unloaded. A message is also sent to the agents waiting at the stop."}, {"heading": "Passenger agent", "text": "Passenger agents are the other main agents of the model. Passengers are generated and their departure and destination points are stored. At this point, the passenger waits until the next bus arrives at that stop. As several passengers can wait for the bus, a FIFO queue of passengers is held. In fact, this is done by a helper, the so-called stop agent. Its main action is to queue up passengers and free a number of passengers from the queue, after a message is received from a bus agent that he has arrived at that stop. \u2022 Boarding: When the bus arrives, the queue is emptied (partially) by the stop agent and the passenger boards the bus. \u2022 Trading: When the last passenger is loaded at the stop or the bus is full, all passengers on the bus can receive a message that this bus is boarding and the passenger receives the signal that he is moving to the destination."}, {"heading": "6.2 Passenger growth", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "6.3 Visualization", "text": "To visualize the results of our model, we have developed two options: The first option is a single simulation in which each modeled agent is displayed on a geographical (GIS) map based on OpenStreetMap4. This simulation runs on a single 4OpenStreetMap, https: / / www.openstreetmap.org /, Visits: February 22, 2017 working day and the user can set the speed of the simulation between 14 real-time and 500 times real-time value. This visualization allows policy makers to see in detail what impact some of their strategies have and where problems occur. A screenshot of this visualization is in Appendix A. The second visualization option is more of a metavisualization. This visualization is a dashboard of KPIs. The indicators are selected in accordance with what policy makers consider useful. The main indicators of this visualization are: punctuality, per overview, and regularity for each of the dates we can show during each holding point."}, {"heading": "6.4 Model assumptions and limitations", "text": "In fact, most people who live in the EU are able to live and work in the EU."}, {"heading": "7. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "This section describes several cases that are analyzed from our model. First, the basic model is validated by numerical analyses of dwell time, travel time, punctuality, occupancy and regularity, and then two scenarios of passenger growth are simulated and their effects on different KPIs are presented."}, {"heading": "7.1 Model validation", "text": "First of all, the key figures of the basic model are compared with numerically calculated solutions, the most important factors being travel time and dwell time, as they directly affect all other KPIs. Then, punctuality, occupancy and regularity are compared. As there are no measurements of waiting time, a Poisson-distributed arrival rate is assumed for passengers as described above. Therefore, a comparison with the numerical analysis of the data cannot be made for waiting time. Comparisons are based on averages drawn over 100 simulation runs against the averages calculated from the data."}, {"heading": "Travel time", "text": "We first compare the travel time. We calculated the average travel time for each travel segment in seconds for both directions and listed the results on the basis of the stop number in Table 2. Since the travel time is sampled from the data, the means of the simulation are very close to the data. In fact, the means of the simulation should at some point approach the numerical mean. Since the MAE of 100 simulation runs on travel time is already within tenths of a second, we conclude from these results that the number of selected simulations is acceptable in order to approximate the data means."}, {"heading": "Dwell time", "text": "Secondly, the dwell time is calculated using the above-mentioned linear model for the dwell time of doors, which is based on the boarding and disembarking of passengers and a distribution of the dwell time when no passengers have boarded. The dwell time per stop is shown in Table 3.The mean absolute error (MAE), which is taken over the average dwell time, is of a different order of magnitude for the dwell time than for the travel time. The mean relative error rate is 0.69% and 0.34% for the travel time and 10.88% and 8.85% for the dwell time. Interestingly, the dwell time is overestimated in most cases, but not in all cases. Since most of the door opening times have a good diagonal distribution, the linear model could easily overestimate most of the dwell times as it makes the least use of the time."}, {"heading": "Punctuality", "text": "The first indicator we are looking at is punctuality, for which the means per stop are compared, as shown in Table 4. Punctuality is defined here as the deviation from the planned departure time in seconds. Punctuality is determined mainly by the cumulative sum of travel time and duration of stay. Average travel time of the simulations is almost the average travel time of the data, but we know that the differences between the punctuality of the data and the model occur mainly due to the deviations in the duration of stay. We can also see this from the data. Departure time varies (and a small difference in travel time) is accumulated and shown in both directions. However, another factor is at play, namely departure punctuality at the first stop."}, {"heading": "Occupancy", "text": "The next indicator is occupancy. Occupancy measures how many passengers (pax) are on the bus at the point at which the bus leaves a stop. It is the sum total difference of all check-ins and check-outs for this journey, up to and including the stop. Large variations in punctuality between journeys, which are later analysed as regularity, could directly affect occupancy in this way.In Table 5, the average occupancy after each stop is compared with the data. There is only a small difference between the data and the simulation. This means that the passengers are generated correctly, but since the data is considered to be averaged, we cannot directly see whether the passengers are boarding the bus for which they are scheduled. Therefore, it is useful to look at the occupancy of the buses for each journey."}, {"heading": "Regularity", "text": "Regularity tells us something about the difference between the scheduled timetable and the actual timetable. The greater the difference, the more some buses will have less or less capacity. We see that there are some deviations in punctuality with the data, but that the occupancy does not seem to suffer from it. Therefore, it is interesting to deal with the regularity. We calculate the regularity from the time a bus leaves a stop and the time the next bus leaves that stop. However, if one bus is more late than the next one, it will have an effect on regularity. Average results will be shown in Table 6.We see that there is an overestimation of regularity. This means that in the simulation the deviations in punctuality between journeys are greater than in the data."}, {"heading": "7.2 Use case: passenger growth", "text": "Now that the base model is validated, the model simulates two realistic scenarios: Two scenarios are simulated as an example, but the use of a generic input format allows a policy maker to easily simulate all possible growth scenarios for passengers that vary specific stops, rides or directions in which the growth takes place. Growth results are compared with the results of the base simulation for each application and the results are listed."}, {"heading": "10% passenger growth", "text": "The first scenario simulates a 10% passenger growth on this specific bus line in both directions. This is a realistic scenario, as last year a 16% increase in passengers was already realized on this specific line. The impact on the KPIs is immediately evident. Punctuality increases at almost every stop in both directions. Time increases with passengers boarding and disembarking. As each stop has a 10% increase in passengers, punctuality suffers more and more. At some stops, this is even greater than the absolute increase in passengers derived from the O-D matrices."}, {"heading": "25% passenger growth on a specific stop", "text": "The next scenario simulates a 25% passenger growth at certain stops in both directions. Again, this is not an unrealistically high growth scenario, as one of the stops already has a 51% passenger growth rate in a single year. 25% growth rate is at stops 0 to 3 in the city center. These stops are located just outside the city and have parking and driving facilities. People from all downtown areas can drive toward these stops. The city is currently working on a parking plan that will cause a radical reduction in car parking in the city center. These stops are just outside the city and have parking and driving facilities."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK", "text": "This paper develops a hybrid agent-based and discrete event simulation model for a high frequency bus line for the bus company Arriva. This hybrid approach can simulate an interactive bus and passenger environment, based on historical data, and provides insights into the impact on bus punctuality, capacity utilisation and regularity. Various models of passenger growth can be easily analysed using the simulation, and the impact on the above performance indicators are visually easy to understand. Two of these passenger growth scenarios are shown and their impact on the KPIs becomes clear. With only a 10% increase in passengers at all stops, capacity approaches, especially during peak hours. In addition, average punctuality is increased by several seconds. An increase at a particular stop reveals an even greater workload problem."}, {"heading": "9. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] E. Bonabeau.

The model is validated using several performance indicators, showing that under some model assumptions, it can realistically simulate real-life situations. The simulation\u2019s workings are illustrated by two use cases.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
