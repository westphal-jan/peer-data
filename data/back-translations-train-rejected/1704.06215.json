We aim to characterise all classes of CSPs defined by a forbidden pattern that are solved by singleton arc consistency and closed under removing constraints. We identify five new patterns whose absence ensures solvability by singleton arc consistency, four of which are provably maximal and three of which generalise 2-SAT. Combined with simple counter-examples for other patterns, we make significant progress towards a complete classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 16:29:21 GMT  (30kb)",

For natural patterns (which define classes of CSPs that are closed by removing restrictions), there are only a relatively small number of irreducible patterns whose SAC solubility is still open. Besides clarifying the remaining patterns, one possible line of future work is to investigate pattern sets or partially ordered patterns [17] that produce SAC-soluble (natural) classes of CSPs. We hope that the notion of natural classes of CSP instances will build a bridge between relational and structural classes that could lead to the discovery of new hybrid tradable classes (which are not necessarily defined by prohibited patterns)."}, {"heading": "A A necessary condition for solvability by SAC", "text": "To establish some basic characteristics of patterns that can be solved by SAC, we first show that several small patterns cannot be solved by SAC (= 3). To do this, consider the following examples: \u2022 I3COL4: corresponds to a complete pattern on 4 different levels, i.e. four variables x1,. \u2022 I3,4: corresponds to an alternative encoding of the 3-color graphics on 4 new variables y1, y2, y3, so that yj = i are assigned variable colors j = i. There are now seven variables (x1, x3, x4, y1) with domains y1, y3)."}, {"heading": "B SAC-solvability of T3", "text": "Consider the pattern T3 shown in Figure 21. This is the only maximum two-constraint pattern whose SAC solubility is not determined by our main theorem, Proposition 1, and the results of [14]. If T4 does not occur, then I have a solution, so let us examine the case in which T4 occurs on variables (x, y, z) and values ax, ay, by, cy, az, byaz as positive edges and axis, ayaz as negative edges. By arc consistency cy cy has a support bx at x and because T3 does not occur bxby is a positive edge. Let us observe that by dominance in R (x, y) and because proximity are substitutable values, a support bx at x and because T3 does not occur bxby, a positive edge at bw and a negative edge at b."}], "references": [{"title": "Constraint Satisfaction Problems Solvable by Local Consistency Methods", "author": ["Libor Barto", "Marcin Kozik"], "venue": "Journal of the ACM,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Theoretical analysis of singleton arc consistency and its extensions", "author": ["Christian Bessiere", "Romuald Debruyne"], "venue": "Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2008}, {"title": "An optimal coarse-grained arc consistency algorithm", "author": ["Christian Bessi\u00e8re", "Jean-Charles R\u00e9gin", "Roland H.C.

We identify five new patterns whose absence ensures solvability by singleton arc consistency, four of which are provably maximal and three of which generalise 2-SAT. Combined with simple counter-examples for other patterns, we make significant progress towards a complete classification.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
