These are typically patients with acute respiratory distress or reduced lung function caused by some underlying conditions such as pneumonia, sepsis or heart disease, or cases where respiration becomes necessary due to neurological disorders, impaired consciousness or weakness following major operations. As advances in health care make it possible to survive critical diseases or operations, the need for mechanical ventilation during recovery is risky. Coupled with ventilation in the care of these patients, sedimented sediposition and analgesia are critical to maintaining physiological stability and control of patients."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "This year it is as far as never before in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany."}, {"heading": "3 Methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Critical Care Data", "text": "We use the Multi-Parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database (Johnson et al.

The data includes patient demographics, time-stamped measurements from monitoring vital organs at bed, administration of fluids and medications, results from laboratory tests, observations and notes presented by care providers, as well as diagnoses, procedures and billing prescriptions. We extract from this database a series of 8,860 admissions from 8,182 unique adult patients undergoing invasive ventilation. To train and test our discontinuation policy, we filter only those admissions where the patient has been kept under ventilation or support for more than 24 hours.

Non-invasive measurements such as heart rate or respiratory rate are only taken every few hours, while tests for arterial pH or oxygen pressure (when we have multiple measurements within an hour) and the use of sample-and-hold interpolation signals to imply subsequent missing values. Patient status - and thus the need to update sedation or ventilation management - can change within the space of an hour, and naive methods of interpolation are unlikely to provide the accuracy needed at higher time resolutions.

We model patient admissions such as Markov decision-making processes and develop novel representations of the problem state, scope of action, and reward function within this framework. Reinforcement learning with customized Q-iteration using various regressors is then used to learn a simple ventilator cessation policy from examples in historical ICU data. We show that the algorithm is capable of extracting meaningful indicators of patient readiness and recommending promising recommendations for excubation times and sedation levels that exceed clinical practice in terms of regulating vital and retubation systems. There are a number of challenges that need to be overcome before these methods can be meaningfully implemented in a clinical setting: First, to generate robust treatment recommendations, it is important to maintain current policy inventory to ensure the relative sensitivity of the exposed components:"}], "references": [{"title": "The difficultto-wean patient", "author": ["Nicolino Ambrosino", "Luciano Gabbrielli"], "venue": "Expert Review of Respiratory Medicine,", "citeRegEx": "Ambrosino and Gabbrielli.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ambrosino and Gabbrielli.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Icu occupancy and mechanical ventilator use in the united states", "author": ["Hannah Wunsch", "Jason Wagner", "Maximilian Herlim", "David Chong", "Andrew Kramer", "Scott D Halpern"], "venue": "Critical care medicine,", "citeRegEx": "Wunsch et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Wunsch et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Sedation and analgesia in the mechanically ventilated patient", "author": ["Shruti B Patel", "John P Kress"], "venue": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,", "citeRegEx": "Patel and Kress.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Patel and Kress.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Sedation in the intensive care setting", "author": ["Christopher G Hughes", "Stuart McGrane", "Pratik P Pandharipande"], "venue": "Clin Pharmacol,", "citeRegEx": "Hughes et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Hughes et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "What is the optimal rate of failed extubation", "author": ["James S Krinsley", "Praveen K Reddy", "Abid Iqbal"], "venue": "Critical Care,", "citeRegEx": "Krinsley et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Krinsley et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Sedation and weaning from mechanical ventilation: Time for \u2018best practice\u2019 to catch up with new realities", "author": ["Giorgio Conti", "Jean Mantz", "Dan Longrois", "Peter Tonner"], "venue": "Multidisciplinary respiratory medicine,", "citeRegEx": "Conti et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Conti et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "The pulmonary physician in critical care: Difficult weaning", "author": ["J Goldstone"], "venue": "Thorax, 57(11):986\u2013991,", "citeRegEx": "Goldstone.,? \\Q2002\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Goldstone.", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Clinical data based optimal sti strategies for hiv: A reinforcement learning approach", "author": ["Damien Ernst", "Guy-Bart Stan", "Jorge Goncalves", "Louis Wehenkel"], "venue": "45th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,", "citeRegEx": "Ernst et al\\.,? \\Q2006\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ernst et al\\.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Reinforcement learning strategies for clinical trials in nonsmall cell lung cancer", "author": ["Yufan Zhao", "Donglin Zeng", "Mark A.
