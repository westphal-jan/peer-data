Evolutionary algorithms", "text": "Evolutionary algorithms (EA) use stochastic search results as inspiration for the natural evolutionary process. EA methods often share the following rules: 1-EAs work with a population of individuals (candidate solutions) rather than with a single candidate solution; 2-EAs use a biased evaluation function to obtain some of the genetic material; 3-EAs create new individuals who are usually able to identify with another."}, {"heading": "3.2. The MOSES automated program learning", "text": "MOSES performs a supervised learning and uses a scoring function or training data as input. MOSES sends a \"combo program\" to the output that estimates the scoring function. MOSES creates a population of programs and then searches for neighbors and \"mutated\" programs and calculates their fitness. After a certain number of iterations, the best program is presented as a result. MOSES in particular constructs a population of \"Demes.\" Each Demme is a program with many tunable parameters. These parameters are called \"buttons.\" So it is not just a matter of finding the best demme, but also of selecting the best demme with the best controller settings. MOSES selects a demme and performs random mutations on it. This is done by inserting new controllers in random places. The best controller settings for each program are disabled."}, {"heading": "3.3. The need for preprocessing along with MOSES", "text": "As described in Section 3.1, determining the functional set is crucial for GP. The functional set has a high impact on the population number and length of the trees. If GP is used to classify many datasets with many attributes, it results in a large population and long individual length, which results in a high computational load. On the other hand, the geographic functions for expressing the topological and geometric relationships between spatial data require a lot more calculations. A solution to these problems can be achieved by an architecture that pre-processes geographical relationships with the least impact on meaningfulness, which will greatly affect the time and storage requirements. Considering the geographical relationships calculated in the pre-processing phase, this requires more calculations."}, {"heading": "3.4. Spatial relationships", "text": "Topological relationships are a certain class of spatial relations defined between two spatial or geographical relations (CC Method 1992). Other classes of spatial relations are distance relations that determine the order of objects. A distance relationship is a positive real number and can also be expressed with less precision using phrases such as \"close to\" and \"far from.\" Political relations represent the relative position of an object to another and require the handling of space. Thus, a reference system and an axis are necessary (e.g. for the three-dimensional argumentation of a system with relations \"right of,\" \"above,\" \"below,\" before, \"behind,\" geographical. \"Boolean topological relations between two objects are based on the concepts of intersection, internality and externality. A well-known formalism for topological relations is RCC, in which all relations between entities are derived from a connecting predicate."}, {"heading": "3.5. The proposed architecture \u2013 GGeo", "text": "In this section, the GGeo architecture is presented as a novel hybrid data mining approach that uses a combination of spatial data pre-processing and automated MOSES learning algorithm. It efficiently performs classification tasks in geographical databases. GGeo unifies geographical constraints and operation at each instance. Two related architectures are proposed, as can be seen in Figure 3, which are described as follows.3.5.1. Inputs and outputs of GGeo The inputs to the system are a collection of numerical, Boolean, spatial characteristics. In classifying cities, for example, the numerical characteristics are population, Gini index, and the Boolean characteristics are provincial capitals and geographical characteristics such as city maps, streets and rivers, which are in line and polygon form. GGeo creates a different program for each class, learning from the training data (for example, some cities) and then classifying test spatial characteristics accordingly."}, {"heading": "TF = Target Feature", "text": "In fact, it is not that it is a mere thought game, but an attempt to change the world, \"he told\" Welt am Sonntag \":\" I don't think we will be able to change the world. \"He added,\" I don't think we will be able to change the world. \"He added,\" I don't think we will be able to change the world. \""}, {"heading": "4.

Raw dataset", "text": "The spatial datasets used in this study are converted into the WGS84 system. Geographical points are represented with latitude and longitude, each of which is represented with double precision using decimals. Iranian cities are geographical polygons, which are sets of points with the same start and end point. In each city, general attributes such as population and the latest update are shown, the date is also provided. Iranian roads were extracted from OpenStreetMap-OSM in the form of geographical lines (sets of ordered points). Other Iranian data came from the MapCrusine website. After data collection, the geometric data was extracted in WKT format. The entire map circumference was taken with vertical and horizontal grid lines to calculate the spatial relationships of the features."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion and future work", "text": "In this paper, GGeo was proposed as a novel hybrid data mining approach to classify spatial characteristics such as cities in geographical databases where spatial and non-spatial data are present. Iranian cities were used as case studies to illustrate the approach. Comprehensive evaluation showed that the use of fuzzy topology relationships can significantly increase the quality of knowledge in geographical databases. Furthermore, the GGeo architecture, which benefits from the evolutionary MOSES algorithm, is competitive and robust, and has excellent noise tolerance. A pre-processing approach proposed as a plugin for geoquette further improved the algorithm. Future work may include the use of association rules extracted into strategic decisions to improve Gatim quality."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank the members of the OpenCog project who helped us develop the original idea and the introduction of MOSES.
