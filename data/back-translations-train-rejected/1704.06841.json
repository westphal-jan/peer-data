Introduction", "text": "With the notable exception of the work [1], current approaches rely on dictionaries to represent meaning, but impose limitations on the level of representation and modeling, especially when it comes to social determinants of health. For example, the phrase \"the patient lives with his mother who is unable to leave home\" is important in a care management setting. It is difficult to model using existing tools: first, the fragment refers to the patient's mother, not the patient; second, it indicates social exclusion without using a word itself associated with social exclusion.The goal behind this work is to apply machine learning approaches to develop models that allow an automatically generated context-based and rich representation of information."}, {"heading": "2. Related Works", "text": "The classification of health-related texts is considered a special case of text classification. Machine learning algorithms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been successfully applied: e.g., support vector machines and latent dirichlet allocation have been used for some tasks such as classification on medical notes [1] or other documents for diseases such as diabetes with satisfactory results [2,3]. State-of-the-art document classification models are designed for neural networks. Mikolov et al. [7] introduce an approach to learning word vector representations, Word2vec, which is simple and efficient. For neural embedding, Le et al. [4] introduce distributed representations of paragraphs, Doc2vec, and capture semantics in dense vectors. Other studies on CNNs for learning high-level characteristics have also shown competitive results. Other work by Kalchbrenner et al. [5] develop the Dynamic Modeline Networks for first medical use."}, {"heading": "3. Methods", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own if they do not play by the rules."}, {"heading": "4. Evaluation", "text": "In this area, we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able to hide, and that we are able to hide ourselves, \"he said.\" We have to be able to put ourselves in a position, to put ourselves in a position, to put ourselves in the position we are in, \"he said."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We show that it is possible to use CNNs to represent the semantics of the sentence to be analyzed. Similar to computer vision methods, once learned, these semantic representations can also be used for many alternative tasks such as text comparisons and retrieval tasks. With minimal effort, the approach could also be scaled to generate representations at the paragraph or even document level.In the future, we would like to implement our technique on a much larger scale and with finer-grained clinical classifications. We would expect that, similar to computer vision literature, our evolutionary networking approaches will deliver better results when fed with larger datasets."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work was partially supported by JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR1303, Japan."}], "references": [{"title": "Redundancy-aware topic modeling for patient record notes", "author": ["R.
