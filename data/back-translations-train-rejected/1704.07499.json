Intensive care workers and patients \"families can benefit from decision support to make the critical decision about aggressive or supportive care. Unexpected deaths, which are still prevalent even though patients often show signs of clinical deterioration hours in advance, can also be detected. Most ICU mortality prediction tools used by hospitals are based on severity score systems1,3, which have poor predictive accuracy on an individual basis. One of the main reasons that severity has limited mortality in intensive care is that their main purpose is to compare patient groups and straddle patient populations between hospitals. Recently, classification methods that apply advanced machine-assisted learning methods to time series have been proposed by ICU patients to successfully improve mortality across the board."}, {"heading": "Related Work on ICU Mortality Prediction", "text": "Most of the ICU forecasters have focused on the use of disease focus to accomplish the task. Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) and the Mortality Probability Model (MPM) are some of these scoring systems. APACHE evaluation is based on the knowledge of a panel of experts to select the variables and assign severity scores. Similarly, the SAPS metric has been designed by clinical experts who aim to determine APACHE performance using a simpler model."}, {"heading": "Method Background", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to survive themselves if they are not able to unfold.

Figure 2 shows that the Fmeasure for the proposed ICU mortality classifier performs significantly better than the CCW method and all baseline severity score systems including SASP III, APACHIE IV, MPM0 III (F measure = 66% vs. 55%, 33%, 32% vs. 30%; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Experiment 2: Dynamic Historical Data Preparation using Time Frames. Figure 3 shows that the F measure of the proposed PPMF-ICU mortality classifier performs significantly better than the same classifier applied to CCW aggregation functions (F measure = 66% vs. 60%; p < 0.001). The proposed F measure of the proposed classifier also performs significantly better than the same classifier applied to CCW aggregation functions (F measure = 66% vs. 60%; p < 0.001)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We conducted three experiments to test different hypotheses; the first experiment showed that there is similarity with existing machine learning methods and with the gravity point systems; the reason for the poor performance of gravity point systems is that they are not designed to make patient-specific predictions; instead, they are more suitable for population-based recommendations, especially on a daily basis; and the reason that the basic CCW learning method of PPMF has been exceeded is to make general alignments with the data; accurate ICU mortality predictions need to take into account each patient's unique behavior and monitoring of their status over the following periods. Using PPMW models that result in the suggested flexibility of the classifier is to provide CCW patients with the same data."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The proposed method exceeded the aggregation methods commonly used to summarize time series data, and the gradient descent method for assigning weight to traits proved superior to other types of trait assessment methods that are not based on the classifier's feedback. As a future direction, this method can be applied to many health problems where the data for adapting general approximation models is complex (i.e. the data input consists of multiple data sets for each patient).Many methodological enhancements to the proposed PPMF, including improving the standardization of time series data and integrating distance and core approaches for local approximation models, could continue to be fruitful in the future."}], "references": [{"title": "Using serial severity scores to predict death in ICU patients: a validation study and review of the literature", "author": ["EJ Gartman", "BP Casserly", "D Martin", "NS.
