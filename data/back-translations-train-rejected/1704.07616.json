This leads to three small classifiers with fewer classes (i.e. | T | classes for the tag classifier, 3 for the layer / reduction classifier, and | L | for the label classifier), rather than one large classifier with many more classes (i.e. | T | + 2 | L |). More importantly, we use continuous representations instead of discrete indicator features to build the classifiers. As suggested by Chen and Manning [2014], xlecalized network indicators are critical to using the complexity of parsing, and we often fail to fully utilize them."}, {"heading": "4.2 Neural POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing", "text": "Our work is also inspired by recent advances in the application of neural networks to POS tagging [Huang et al., 2015] and dependency parsing [Chen and Manning, 2014; Dyer et al., 2015; Ballesteros et al., 2015; Alberti et al., 2015; Ammar et al., 2016; Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016; Andor et al., 2016; Wang and Chang, 2016; Cheng et al., 2016; Dozat and Manning, 2017]. Among them, our work is most similar [Zhang and Weiss, 2016], which suggest stack propagation to integrate a tagging model into a neural parser. They propose a stacked pipeline of models and use POS tags as regulators of learned representations. While Zhang and White [2016] use the hidden layer of the tagger network as input for the parser, we are interested in enabling tagging and parsing so that they can be used in a common search space."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented an approach to joint tagging of parts of the language and parsing dependencies using transition-based neural networks.

Three neural network based classifiers are designed to resolve shift/reduce, tagging, and labeling conflicts. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods for joint POS tagging and dependency parsing across a variety of natural languages.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
