BACKGROUND", "text": "In this section, we describe the notation used in the rest of the paper. In addition, we present a brief statistical background for completeness and better understanding of the rest of the paper. A time series refers to a series of observations that are collected successively over time. Let xt denote the observation at the time t where t = 0, 1, 2,..., and let X denote the set of all observations that make up the time series."}, {"heading": "2.1 Grubbs Test and ESD", "text": "In this subsection, we give a brief overview of the most commonly used anomalous detection techniques > of the two-step series. Essentially, these techniques use statistical hypotheses to determine whether a date is anomalous. In other words, the test is used to evaluate the rejection of the null hypothesis (H0), for a predetermined level of significance, in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1).2.1.1 Grubbs Test Grubbs Test Grubbs Test Test [28, 29] however, is designed to detect the largest anomaly within a univariate sample. The test assumes that the underlying data distribution is normal. Grubbs \"test is defined for the hypothesis: H0: There are no outliers in the data set (1) H1: There is at least one outlier in the data set (2) Grubbs test statistics are defined as follows: C = maxed \u2212 x."}, {"heading": "2.2 Median and Median Absolute Deviation", "text": "The techniques discussed in the previous subsection use mean and standard deviation. It is generally known that these measurements are sensitive to anomalous data [25, 32]. Therefore, it has been proposed to address these problems by using the statistically robust median and median absolute deviation (MAD).The mean of sample x can be distorted by a single anomaly, with the distortion increasing as xt \u2192 \u00b1 \u221e. In contrast, the median of the sample is robust against such distortion and can tolerate up to 50% of the anomalous data. Therefore, the mean of the sample should have a breakdown point [33, 34] of 0, while the median of the sample should have a breakdown point of 0.5. For a universal dataset X1, X2,..., Xn, MAD is defined as the median of absolute deviations from the median (formally: 1Although the Tietjen-Moore test can be used to detect multiple anomalies."}, {"heading": "2.3 Precision, Recall, and F-Measure", "text": "As mentioned in section 1, the effectiveness of the proposed techniques has been assessed from three different angles. In each case, we report on the following indicators: precision, recall and F-measurement (these indicators are commonly used to report the effectiveness of an algorithm in data mining, information gathering, etc.). In connection with detection of anomalies, precision is defined as: precision = | {S}. {G} | = tp tp + fp (9), where S is the amount of anomalies detected, and G is the amount of anomalies between soil and truth. In other words, precision is the ratio of true positives (tp) to false positives (fp) that have actually been detected."}, {"heading": "3. TECHNIQUES", "text": "In this section, we explain our approaches Seasonal ESD (SESD) and Seasonal Hybrid ESD (S-H-ESD). Note that both approaches are currently used to automatically detect anomalies in production data on a daily basis. We used an incremental approach to develop both approaches. In particular, we started by evaluating the \"rule of thumb\" (the three sigma rule) against production data and gradually learned the limitations of using existing techniques to automatically detect anomalies in production data. In the rest of this section, we will guide the reader through the key steps of our incremental approach mentioned above."}, {"heading": "3.1 Three-Sigma Rule", "text": "The rule can potentially be used to capture large global anomalies, but it is not suitable for detecting seasonal anomalies, as illustrated by Figure 2, in which the seasonal anomalies that could not be captured by the 3 \u00b7 \u03c3 rule are commented on with circles. It is conceivable that the input time series can potentially be segmented into several windows and the above rule can be applied to each window by applying their respective orders of magnitude. Intuition behind the segmentation is that the input time series are not stationary and thus vary over time. The variation in relation to different window lengths is shown in Figure 3. Figure 2 shows that applying the rule on a perwindow basis - the time series have been divided into two windows - does not facilitate the capture of normal time series if we do not provide the normality for the capture of the \"3\" applicable time series."}, {"heading": "3.2 Moving Averages", "text": "To this end, the use of moving averages has been proposed to filter out (/ smooth out) white noise. The most common moving average is the single moving average (SMA), which is defined as: SMAt = xt + xt \u2212 1 +. + xt \u2212 (n \u2212 1) n (12) Note that SMA weighs each of the previous n data equally. This may not be desirable given the dynamic nature of the data stream observed in production and from a review perspective. To this end, the use of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA \u2212) of moving averages (EWMA \u2212 defined by Equation 13) is not desirable."}, {"heading": "3.3 Seasonality and STL", "text": "As discussed in the previous section, Twitter data (from production) has a severe seasonality. In most cases, the underlying distribution has a multimodal distribution, as illustrated in Figure 4. This limits the applicability of existing anomaly detection techniques such as grubbs and ESD, since existing techniques require normal data distribution. Specifically, we have learned that the presence of multiple modes results in a higher value of standard deviation (the increase can be up to 5%), which in turn masks some of the \"true\" anomalies. To this end, we use time series that break down, using a particular time series (X) into three - seasonal (SX), trends (TX) and residual components (RX) - components that exhibit an unimodal distribution of values based on the application of anomalous detection methods."}, {"heading": "3.4 Seasonal ESD (S-ESD)", "text": "To recapitulate the applicability of the algorithms in this section, we must deal with the system in which we are: \"It is not as if it were a global system.\" \"It is not as if it were a global system.\" \"It is not as if it were a global system.\" \"It is as if it were a global system.\" \"It is not as if it were a global system.\" \"It is as if it were a global system.\" \"It is as if it was a system.\" It is as if it was a global system. \"\" It is not as if it was a global system. \"It is not as if it was a system.\" It is not as if it was a system, as if it was a system. \"It is as if it is a system.\" It is as if it is a system. \"It is as if it is a system.\""}, {"heading": "3.5 Seasonal Hybrid ESD (S-H-ESD)", "text": "Seasonal hybrid ESD (S-H-ESD) builds on the S-ESD algorithm described in the previous subsection to provide a more consistent measurement of the central tendency of a time series with a high percentage of anomalies. Consider, for example, the time series shown in Figure 8a. From the figure, we find that the seasonal component is obvious in the middle region of the time series, but a significant portion of the time series is anomalous, which can inflate the mean and standard deviation, resulting in real anomalies being marked as non-anomalous and thus producing a high number of false negatives. We have addressed the above deviation by presenting the mean and standard deviation used in ESD as omal with more robust statistical measures during the calculation of the test deviation (see Equation 5)."}, {"heading": "4. EVALUATION", "text": "In this section, we outline our methodology for evaluating the proposed techniques, discuss their use in production and, last but not least, present results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques."}, {"heading": "4.1 Methodology", "text": "The effectiveness of S-ESD and S-H-ESD was evaluated against a broad corpus of time series data from production, which corresponded to both low system ratios and higher core ratios (business ratios).For example, the following ratios were used, but not limited to: r System Metricsz CPU utilizationz Heap usagez Time spent in GC (Garbage Collection) z Disk writesr Application Metricsz Request Latencyr Core Driversz Tweets per minute (TPM) z Retweets per minute (RTPM) z Unique Photos Per minute (UPPM) More than 20 data sets were used for evaluation, ranging from two-week periods to four-week periods with hours of granularity."}, {"heading": "4.2 Production", "text": "Increasingly, machine-generated BigData is being used to increase the performance and efficiency of data centers / cloud computing platforms. BigData is often characterized by volume and speed [43, 44]. Given the variety of services in our Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the fact that each service monitors a large number of metrics, it is imperative to automatically detect anomalies 2 in the time series of each metric. We have used the proposed techniques to automatically detect anomalies in production data for a wide range of services. It is also possible to set a threshold to refine the amount of anomalies detected (using the proposed techniques) based on the specific requirements of the service owner. For example, a manual approach from a cost perspective would be prohibitive and would also be possible for capacity engineers to set a threshold so that only anomalies greater than the specified threshold are displayed."}, {"heading": "4.3 Efficacy", "text": "This year, the number of people who are able to stay in the United States has skyrocketed, \"he told the German Press Agency in an interview with the New York Times."}, {"heading": "5. PREVIOUS WORK", "text": "In this section we have an overview of previous work in the context of anomaly detection. A lot of anomaly detection research has been conducted in various areas such as, but not limited to, statistics, signal processing, finance, econometrics, manufacturing and networking. However, for detailed coverage of the same, the reader is referred to books and survey results that are highly contextual in nature. Based on our in-depth literature survey, we find that the techniques discussed in the rest of this section are complementary to different types of data sets (as cloud infrastructure data) and Hence to the techniques proposed in this paper. Manufacturing anomaly detection manifests itself in the form of determining a particular process in a state of normal and stable behavior."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we introduced two novel statistical techniques for automatically detecting anomalies in cloud infrastructure data. Although there is a large research group for detecting anomalies, the seasonal (and trendy) nature of cloud infrastructure data limits the application of techniques. To this end, we proposed a method called SeasonalESD (S-ESD), which combines seasonal decomposition and the generalized ESD test for detecting anomalies. The second method, Seasonal Hybrid ESD (S-H-ESD), builds on SESD to allow for a robust anomaly when a significant proportion (up to 50%) of the underlying data is anomalous. This is achieved by extending the original ESD algorithm with robust statistical measures, median and median absolute deviations (MAD). The effectiveness of both the Seasonal-9 as well as the ESD-2D was performed using both ESD and ESD-2D."}, {"heading": "7.

become increasingly important drivers, amongst other drivers, for user retention in the context of web services such as social networks, and web search. Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often give rise to anomalies, making it very challenging to maintain high availability, while also delivering high performance. Given that service-oriented architectures (SOA) typically have a large number of services, with each service having a large set of metrics, automatic detection of anomalies is nontrivial. Although there exists a large body of prior research in anomaly detection, existing techniques are not applicable in the context of social network data, owing to the inherent seasonal and trend components in the time series data. To this end, we developed two novel statistical techniques for automatically detecting anomalies in cloud infrastructure data. Specifically, the techniques employ statistical learning to detect anomalies in both application, and system metrics. Seasonal decomposition is employed to filter the trend and seasonal components of the time series, followed by the use of robust statistical metrics \u2013 median and median absolute deviation (MAD) \u2013 to accurately detect anomalies, even in the presence of seasonal spikes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques from three different perspectives, viz., capacity planning, user behavior, and supervised learning. In particular, we used production data for evaluation, and we report Precision, Recall, and F-measure in each case.", "creator": "pdflatex"}}}
