We hid email messages about fake bank accounts in fifteen of the accounts to mimic real-world webmail users that sometimes store sensitive information in their accounts. We then leaked credentials to the honey accounts via paste sites on the Surface Web and the Dark Web, and collected data for fifteen days. Our statistical analyses on the data show that cybercriminals are more likely to discover sensitive information (bank account information) in the Greek accounts than the remaining accounts, contrary to the expectation that Greek ought to constitute a barrier to the understanding of non-Greek visitors to the Greek accounts. We also extracted the important words among the emails that cybercriminals accessed (as an approximation of the keywords that they searched for within the honey accounts), and found that financial terms featured among the top words. In summary, we show that language plays a significant role in the ability of cybercriminals to access sensitive information hidden in compromised webmail accounts.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 16:07:34 GMT  (608kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07759v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.CL", "authors": ["emeric bernard-jones", "jeremiah onaolapo", "gianluca stringhini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07759"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.07759.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Email Babel: Does Language Affect Criminal Activity in Compromised Webmail Accounts?", "authors": ["Emeric Bernard-Jones", "Jeremiah Onaolapo"], "emails": ["emeric.bernard-jones.15@ucl.ac.uk", "j.onaolapo@cs.ucl.ac.uk", "g.stringhini@cs.ucl.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords - Webmail \u00b7 Data theft \u00b7 LanguageI. INTRODUCTIONOnline accounts offer many useful online functionalities, but also expose users to various risks, including information theft. For example, we send e-mails, edit online documents, and network with colleagues through online accounts. As a result, these accounts are attractive not only to fraudsters trying to make a fortune out of the contents of such accounts, such as passwords and unauthorized account access are commonplace today, as they store private information through design. This makes them attractive to fraudsters trying to make a fortune out of the contents of such accounts. Data breaches and unauthorized account access are commonly associated with high financial and reputational costs for victims and online service providers alike. Cybercriminals typically compromise online accounts by carrying out social engineering or phishing attacks on victims. [2] Other ways by which cybercriminals obtain access data and compromise online accounts, include database breaches."}, {"heading": "II. BACKGROUND", "text": "In this section, we discuss the categories of cybercrime, webmail accounts, and the relationship between language and criminal skills. Finally, we present our research questions and hypotheses."}, {"heading": "A. Categories of cybercrime", "text": "Broadly speaking, cybercrime is a term used to describe a variety of cases in which technology is used to carry out or is involved in a criminal act. [8] It embodies a variety of criminal activities (for example, identity theft and fraud), many of which are among the fastest-moving types of crime in many developed countries. [9] We are discussing the three distinct categories of cybercrime, namely cybercrime, cybercrime and cybercrime. [10] These are terrestrial crimes, such as burglary or theft, that involve the use of digital technology in the execution of a criminal act. [11] An example of this is when a bicycle thief uses a mapping application to plan a route through the area from which they were already trying to steal. In cybercrime, the \"cyber-assisted\" element plays a tertiary role in the execution of the crime itself, meaning that the crime would likely remain unaffected if the cyberelement were removed."}, {"heading": "B. Gmail accounts", "text": "Like many other webmail accounts, Gmail users allow them to send and receive text / multimedia messages to each other. However, in addition to sending and receiving e-mails, Gmail users can embed scripts into their accounts, for example, to automatically perform other activities to remind them of important e-mails that require attention. We use this functionality to orchestrate the Gmail accounts used in our experiments by configuring the scripts to send us notifications of changes to the accounts (see Section III-B). After authenticating their accounts, Gmail users can access the e-mails sent to them by other webmail users in their inbox. As they compose e-mails in preparation for sending to other webmail users, these e-mail drafts will appear in the Draft folder. Similarly, they can access the e-mails that they have previously sent to others in the Send folder."}, {"heading": "C. Language and crime", "text": "Research suggests that criminal activity is carried out along familiar patterns of behavior, spatially, through types of crime, or through the network of actors. [15] This suggests that successful criminals rely to a large extent on a detailed understanding of the processes surrounding the crimes they commit and the areas in which they are committed. [16] Therefore, we can safely assume that their ability to connect to and navigate through a webmail account, their environment, and the behavior of their victims has a domino effect on their ability to commit crimes. [17] When attempting to study the behavior patterns of criminals online, connecting to a webmail account and navigating through it can be considered a \"routine activity,\" as these are frequent online actions by legitimate users. Changes in the composition, interface, layout, or language of the webmail account can therefore be considered a barrier to executing a crime in the account - much like a physical barrier (for example, a fence) that discourages the tertiary nature of our work."}, {"heading": "III. METHODOLOGY", "text": "In this section we describe the creation, population and sowing of the honey accounts. We also describe our method of collecting data from the honey accounts."}, {"heading": "A. Creating honey accounts", "text": "We created thirty Honey accounts on the Gmail service in three languages, namely English (ten accounts), Romanian (ten accounts) and Greek (ten accounts). We chose these languages for linguistic reasons; English, because it is an \"international\" language; Romanian, because it is the only Latin-based Eastern European language; and Greek, because it has a unique alphabet. To minimize potential distortions in our dataset, we configured the fake accounts so that each linguistic group includes five men and five women with dates of birth from 1960 to 2000. We did this to make the accounts appear as credible as possible by using a diverse persona set.In order to populate the accounts, we subscribed them to over fifty language-specific newsletters and mailing lists that follow specific topics we had previously selected. Topics include fashion, law, and gardening, and were selected according to the gender and date of birth of the fake person."}, {"heading": "B. Monitoring honey accounts", "text": "To monitor illicit activity in the honey accounts, we used the infrastructure outlined in our previous paper [6], which includes scripts embedded in the honey accounts, a sinkhole email server, a notification store to receive activity notifications from honey accounts, an email client to retrieve emails from the notification store, and some other monitoring scripts. Figure 2 shows an overview of the monitoring infrastructure. The system provides us with information about activity on the honey accounts, especially when emails are opened, sent, or sent. It also provides us with information about email drafts created by visitors to the honey accounts. In addition, we receive daily \"heartbeat\" messages from each honey account to inform us about active accounts. We stop receiving \"heartbeat\" messages from an account if it has been blocked by Google, or if the password has been completely changed by a cybercriminal."}, {"heading": "C. Leaking honey accounts", "text": "After exploiting the honey accounts, we leaked their credentials via paste sites on the Surface Web and the Dark Web, namely Pastebin, Insertor, and Stronghold. Insertor and Stronghold are dark web paste sites that are only accessible through specialized software, such as the TOR browser. Pastebin is accessible through any popular web browser, such as Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. In each leak, we inserted credentials and messages for honey accounts indicating that the credentials came from hacked accounts. We corrected rogue accesses to honey accounts and analyzed the resulting data set. Details of our analysis can be found in Section IV."}, {"heading": "D. Threats to validity", "text": "It is important to mention that the surveillance infrastructure we used in this study can only detect when an e-mail was opened, and not necessarily when it was read. For the purpose of this study, we assume that the opened e-mails were also read by the person who opened them. Furthermore, we currently lack a way to determine the exact words that were searched in the honey accounts of cybercriminals. Instead, we approach these search terms by evaluating important words in the e-mails that were opened by the cybercriminals. We consider this to be the biggest threat to the internal validity of this study. To minimize the impact of this threat, we have seeded the accounts with emails containing sensitive content (fake financial information) and hidden the e-mails, so that finding them would require some effort on the part of the cybercriminals. We then focused our analysis on these sensitive e-mails. In future work, we hope to find a more precise way to identify the search terms that are persistent for at least some internal threats to passwords."}, {"heading": "E. Ethics", "text": "Because of the sensitive nature of our study, we made sure that the experiments were conducted in an ethical manner. Since the experiments require the release of account data to cybercriminals, there is a risk of misuse. We minimized this risk by configuring the honey accounts so that all outgoing emails are sent to an email server under our control that does not deliver the emails to their intended destination, thus preventing the accounts from being used to spam other users. We also filled the honey accounts with financial information such as bank accounts and online banking information. To avoid harming anyone, we made sure that all the financial data loaded into the accounts were fake (we generated them randomly). Finally, because our experiments were about deceiving cybercriminals into entering fake accounts, we received the ethical consent of our institution."}, {"heading": "IV. DATA ANALYSIS", "text": "A Gmail account keeps records of each unique access and identifies the access with a unique identifier, also known as a \"cookie,\" along with other information about the access, such as access time, IP address and location. We extracted this information from the honey accounts through our honeypot infrastructure (see Section III.) and also evaluated the actions corresponding to those accesses (for example, opening, sending, starting or creating email). In other words, each data unit includes an \"access action.\" During our fifteen-day observation period, we observed 650 data units in 29 honey accounts from nineteen countries. We removed 210 of these data units from our data set (outliers) due to their inappropriate impact on the distribution of data, increasing the total sum of individual data to 440 points. The outliers include the data points started by cybercriminals who ran amok in the honey accounts (outliers) because of their inappropriate impact on the distribution of data, increasing the total sum of individual data to 440 points."}, {"heading": "A. Statistical tests", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to demonstrate that they are able, that they are able to achieve their goals, and that they are able to achieve their goals."}, {"heading": "B. Digging for webmail \u201cgold\u201d", "text": "We wanted to understand the topics and words that cybercriminals look for when accessing compromised webmail accounts. Previous research has shown that one of the first steps cybercriminals take after compromising an online account is to evaluate its value by going through its contents. [4] This implies that they perform certain searches to find e-mail messages of interest to them. However, we did not have access to the search terms in the honey accounts as there is currently no API to retrieve such information from the honey accounts. To overcome this limitation, we approached the search terms by analyzing the opened emails and extracting the important words in them, relative to all the emails in the honey accounts. To achieve this, we used term frequency of documents (TF-IDF) analysis by following the method we used in our previous paper, which was called \"R\" for all emails in Romanian language group."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "In this section, we offer a summary of our findings and the limitations of our approach. Finally, we discuss possible future work results. Contrary to our expectations, our results show that cybercriminals are more likely to locate sensitive information in the Greek accounts than accounts in the other languages. This is quite fascinating, especially since only two of the accounts we observed were from Greece or the Greek-speaking countries. We realize that some accounts were accessed by proxy servers. However, it is clear that those who visited the accounts were not just Greek speakers, and these results contradict the theories of language comprehension and understanding, which suggest that people are significantly impaired in their understanding if they do not understand the language of the object with which they interact."}, {"heading": "VI. RELATED WORK", "text": "Bursztein et al. [4] investigated the use of compromised Gmail accounts in the wild, with particular emphasis on spear phishing as a method by which cybercriminals obtain account information, using Gmail honey pots and collecting data from them. In our previous paper [6], we used a similar honey pot approach to investigate the use of compromised Gmail accounts, but investigated more outlets, especially paste sites, underground forums and malware. We also presented a public honey pot infrastructure that we used in this paper. Other researchers have used honey pot systems to investigate the use of compromised online accounts as well. Liu et al. [23] placed honey data (within honey files) in P2P shared spaces to investigate illegitimate accesses. Nikiforakis et al. [24] also investigated privacy issues in file hosting systems that use honey files [25]."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we examined the impact of language differentiation on the activity of cybercriminals who access compromised webmail accounts. We created, installed and published thirty honey accounts in three languages, namely English, Greek and Romanian. For fifteen days, we collected and analyzed data on the access and activity of the honey accounts. Our tests showed a significant relationship between language and the ability of a cybercriminal to access a sensitive object (with which we had set up the account). Finally, we presented the results of our analysis of the content of the honey accounts. We found that cybercriminals were actually looking for sensitive financial information in the accounts. We hope that our findings will help the research community gain deeper insights into the relationship between language and cybercrime, and potentially provide insights into the development of effective techniques to detect illicit activity in online accounts."}], "references": [{"title": "Measuring the Cost of Cybercrime", "author": ["R.

"We set out to understand the effects of differing language on the ability of cybercriminals to navigate webmail accounts and locate sensitive information in them. To this end, we configured thirty Gmail honeypot accounts with English, Romanian, and Greek language settings. We populated the accounts with email messages in those languages by subscribing them to selected online newsletters. We hid email messages about fake bank accounts in fifteen of the accounts to mimic real-world webmail users that sometimes store sensitive information in their accounts. We then leaked credentials to the honey accounts via paste sites on the Surface Web and the Dark Web, and collected data for fifteen days. Our statistical analyses on the data show that cybercriminals are more likely to discover sensitive information (bank account information) in the Greek accounts than the remaining accounts, contrary to the expectation that Greek ought to constitute a barrier to the understanding of non-Greek visitors to the Greek accounts. We also extracted the important words among the emails that cybercriminals accessed (as an approximation of the keywords that they searched for within the honey accounts), and found that financial terms featured among the top words. In summary, we show that language plays a significant role in the ability of cybercriminals to access sensitive information hidden in compromised webmail accounts.
