We start with a series of these space-time surfaces, which we will define as such, although they are defined by a convex region of our simulation parameters. We assume that all parameter dimensions are standardized, i.e. that we are aware of the complex multiplicity of these surfaces as a whole that we want to capture and represent. We choose implicit functions that we represent as R3 \u00d7 R + \u2192 R to represent specific instances of multiplicity, so that we consider these surfaces as a whole. We assume that these surfaces as a whole (\u03b1) represent the complex multiplicity that we want to capture and represent."}, {"heading": "3.1 Deformation Alignment", "text": "As outlined above, the deformed initial surface for a selected point on the first level can be related to the input parameter size 1. (SDFs) of our input parameter space, while we will designate instances of a single surface deformed by our algorithm (SDFs). Here, we typically represent the origin of our parameter space, i.e., we explain our approach to applying deformation. For the endpoint deformations, our goal is to use only a single deformation for each dimension of the parameter space as close as possible. Before formalizing this in relation to a loss function in the next section, we will explain our procedure for applying deformation.For the endpoint deformations, our goal is to use only a single deformation for each dimension of the parameter space. Therefore, we will correspond to 1, and we can use 1u1 to calculate an intermediate along that dimension."}, {"heading": "4 Learning Deformations", "text": "In this section, we will outline a deformation-conscious approach to machine learning in order to improve the approximation to the initial surface area \u03c6\u03b1. Adapting the composition of the deformations, the previously explained algorithm will produce a smooth transition, but the complex nonlinear behavior that occurs when the parameters of the fluid simulation are changed is typically not captured. This is not surprising, since the endpoint deformations are optimized to achieve the best possible end result for each \u03b1i = 1. We will show that our network can learn to adjust these deformation parameters \u03b1i, and that it can also learn to generate new deformations to improve the quality of the liquid surfaces.To train our machine learning model, we propose the following objective function, which calculates the similarity of a known reference surface throughput and the corresponding approximate deformation parameters \u03b1i. To this end, we will introduce the numerical equivalent solution of 2-cells equal-LOSs."}, {"heading": "4.1 Learning Optimal Deformation Parameters", "text": "We replace these simulation parameters in the Eq plane. (6) We assume that there is an optimal function that gives us the best deformation parameters in relation to the Eq plane (7). (7) We approach this function in relation to a feeding neural network. Thus, we assume that the network should learn to output the appropriate weight factors in relation to the deformations so that the initial surface corresponds to the desired simulation state when the deformations are applied. This application of weighted deformations includes our alignment steps from Sec. 3.1.The network is characterized by the number of layers in the neural network."}, {"heading": "4.2 Generating Deformations with Neural Networks", "text": "Our efforts so far have focused on a large number of degrees of freedom, especially for our four-dimensional network architecture. We can only consider these four endpoint deformations sufficient if we rely on the performance of this method to depend on the amount of variation we can generate with the deformation inputs. So far, our approach has only optimized the weights of the individual deformations to generate V (x, \u03b2 (\u03b1). To allow for further variations, we propose to create an additional space-time deformation field that changes with the simulation parameters. Once again, we are modeling this function with a neural network that effectively affects the final deformed surfaces. Therefore, we will explain how to build and train this generative network architecture. Generative approaches take low-dimensional input data and generate high-dimensional outputs."}, {"heading": "4.3 Training Details", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to hide, and that we are able, we will be able, we will be able, we will be able, we will be able, we will be able, we will be able."}, {"heading": "4.4 Evaluation", "text": "To divide these samples into 2056 training samples, we will first explain a two-dimensional setup parameter space with two-dimensional surfaces. To this end, we will use the SDFs extracted from two-dimensional simulations of a drop falling into a pool. As a simulation parameter, we will select the size of the drop, and it will be its original X position. From this simulation, we will extract a single frame at the surface, which will give us a two-dimensional parameter space. (To train the networks in Section 4, we will try the parameters domain with a corresponding two-dimensional SDF) This setup is illustrated in the figure. We will stretch the parameter range with two deformations u2. To train the networks we have described in Section 4, we will try the parameter domain with a regular 44-fold grid system giving us 2156 training samples. To train the network, we will split these samples into 100 training samples and 2056 training samples."}, {"heading": "5 Long-range Deformations", "text": "Our neural network can successfully refine the deformations based on an initial series of pre-calculated deformations along the sides of the parameter space. Therefore, any improvement for these initial deformations is typically translated into improvements in the quality for the output of our neural network. Therefore, we will propose an additional step aimed at long-term correspondence before discussing more complex four-dimensional results. If we calculate the endpoint deformations, we have two closely related goals: the goal of precisely matching and establishing correct correspondences between source and target, the algorithm we use (optical flow), and many others such as the iterative methods of the closest point, working by matching the next distances. For inputs with significant differences, a deterioration of both desired qualities goes hand in hand: parts of the target shape can be lost, and the probability of reconstructing a target feature from an arbitrarily different source increases."}, {"heading": "6 Mobile Device Implementation", "text": "To demonstrate the high performance that our representation achieves, we have implemented a proof-of-concept application for mobile devices. Our application is divided into two parts: a main loop that is used for surface creation and rendering, and a second loop that handles user interaction, and calculates a final deformation for the main loop that is to be displayed. Both loops work with separate threads and use double buffers to deliver the results. The high-performance tasks of our pipeline are calculated using RenderScript, which is a framework that distributes tasks across the CPU and GPU. Neural networks are instead calculated using separate threads and use double buffers to deliver the results. RenderScript computes the high-performance tasks of our pipeline, which distribute tasks across the CPU and GPU."}, {"heading": "7 Results", "text": "We will show the results of our algorithms for a complete, three-dimensional simulation.

Based on the cho-sen representation, our approach enables real-time interactions with complex fluid effects. To our knowledge, we are also the first to introduce a machine learning approach that actively learns to deform surfaces. We believe it is exciting to see how such generative neural networks can be successfully applied to problems in the context of flow simulations. In the future, it will be interesting to simulate other types of phenomena with our synthesis pipeline, and we plan to investigate how our deformation-aware networks work for optical flow problems outside the realm of flow simulation."}, {"heading": "DOSOVITSKIY, A., FISCHERY, P., ILG, E., HAZIRBAS, C., GOLKOV, V., VAN DER", "text": "SMAGT, P., CREMERS, D., BROX, T., ET AL. 2015.

We propose a method to map this complex behavior over a parameter range onto a reduced representation based on space-time deformations. In order to represent the complexity of the full space of inputs, we use aligned deformations from optical flow solves, and we leverage the power of generative neural networks to synthesize additional deformations for refinement. We introduce a novel deformation-aware loss function, which enables optimization in the highly non-linear space of multiple deformations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase the method with several complex examples in two and four dimensions. Our representation makes it possible to generate implicit surfaces of liquids very efficiently, which allows us to very efficiently display the scene from any angle, and to add secondary effects such as particle systems. We have implemented a mobile application with our full pipeline to demonstrate that real-time interaction is possible with our approach.", "creator": "LaTeX acmsiggraph.cls (11/2015)"}}}
