Introduction", "text": "Vehicle HVAC systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) aim to ensure that passengers are thermally comfortable. Traditionally, the controllers for these systems are hand-coded and tuned to achieve this goal. However, there are a number of drivers for changes: 1. Current systems only control the cabin temperature, whereas thermal comfort also depends on a variety of other factors (such as radiant heat and airflow).

Previous systems relied on waste heat from the engine, while electric vehicles produce much less heat and therefore require a different design. 3. Current systems are energy hungry, whereas electric and hybrid vehicles require a much more energy-efficient approach."}, {"heading": "2.

The reward is a function of the thermal comfort of the building inhabitants, energy consumption and indoor air quality. The proposed controller was compared to a fuzzy PD controller (an evaluation approach that is also used here) and the results showed that after a few simulated years of training the learning controller performed better than the other two controllers.

Cabin Thermal Environmental Model", "text": "In fact, the effects of changes can be assessed quickly. Some simplistic assumptions are necessary and different work tends to make different assumptions about the cabin environment. (For example, Lee et al. (2015) includes the effect of engine heat on supply and recirculation channels, whereas the consequences of changes can be assessed quickly. (For example, Lee et al.) includes the effect of engine heat on supply and recirculation channels, whereas Torregrosse.Jaime et al al al al al al al includes the effects of changes in heat supply and recirculation channels, while Torregrosse.Jaime et al al al al al al al includes the effects of radiant heat effects on a multi-zone minivan. Our focus here is on a clearly described, simple model that could be expanded, but validated against data from a real car in a climatic wind tunnel (Section 3.2).

Figures 3 and 4, based on experiments with a Jaguar XJ in the MIRA LTD climatic wind tunnel, show the heating (by cold) and cooling (by heat) of the vehicle cabin based on headrest height sensors over a series of experiments and also show the simulated or \"model results.\" Simulated results are based on the Bang-Bang controller described further in Section 4.1. These diagrams show that the simulation is broadly consistent with the properties of the physical system and that a controller working well with the simulation is likely to work well in practice as far as temperature control is concerned. Although the modelling of energy consumption is based on reasonable assumptions, we do not have at this stage experimental data that can be validated with the model."}, {"heading": "3.3.

Five possible ventilation temperatures can be selected, which are uniformly defined over the range Ti-A [7, 60] \u2103. Finally, three positions of the recirculation valve Ar-A (0, 12, 1) are available. This results in a total of 60 (4 x 5 x 3) possible measures."}, {"heading": "3.6. Reward function", "text": "The learning objective is to maximize the time spent in comfort (defined here as if the occupant is ET 24 \u00b1 1 \u00b0 C) while minimizing energy consumption. This can be expressed as a reward function: R (s, a) = RC (s) \u2212 E (s, a) / w (7) RC (s) = {0 if Te 24 \u00b1 1 \u00b0 C \u2212 1 otherwise (8) E (s, a) = market value Q-E + 2vi (9), where RC is the penalty for discomfort, E the cost of energy, w = 30,000 the energy weight divisor (which, in layman's terms, means that a 1% improvement in comfort is equivalent to 300 W).This weight can be adjusted to achieve a different balance between energy and comfort (see Section 4.3.1).The above reward function could be expanded further to ensure goals such as minimizing fan noise or ensuring the clarity of the screen are not punished as being outside the limits of the worst component)."}, {"heading": "3.7. Meta parameters", "text": "Meta-parameters control the learning process and can influence how fast the learning progresses. The first is the number of steps per episode set to 500, which allows the agent to achieve a comfortable state from each starting state, but also that the episode length is not so long that new starting states are rarely experienced. The reward discount factor \u03b3 = 0.99 ensures that a policy is adequately rewarded for actions that do not produce an immediate reward. As the reward function does not provide a reward for moving toward comfort (but only for reaching it), the setting of almost 1 allows the agent to achieve comfort even at extreme initial temperatures, the learning rate \u03b1 = 0.01, the exploration factor \u03b5 = 0.16 (for the first 190,000 episodes and zero thereafter) and the decay of the eligibility tracks \u03bb = 0.98 were decided by considering performance during the first 2,000 episodes, as discussed in Section 3.1."}, {"heading": "3.8. Evaluation method", "text": "The performance of the RL controller is tested at regular intervals during learning using a set of 200 randomly selected startup states ST-S0, known as the Test Scenario Set. This approach is a standard test that can be used for all controllers to provide a fair comparison while ensuring that the test for possible startup states is reasonably comprehensive."}, {"heading": "4. Evaluation", "text": "The RL-based controller is evaluated by comparing its performance with a bang-bang controller, a proportional controller, a commercial controller and a fuzzy logic controller. Three possible Ts temperature sensors are simulated for each controller: the true cabin air temperature (air), the average cabin and interior temperature (average) and the corresponding temperature (et). All controllers operate according to the action representation (see Section 3.5)."}, {"heading": "4.1. Bang-bang, proportional and commercial controllers", "text": "The first three hand-coded controllers are somewhat similar: the Bangbang controller blows the maximum fan rate to cool or heat the cabin until it is within 1 \u00b0 C of the target, then blows the minimum fan rate and tries to reach the target temperature; the proportional controller is similar but reduces fan speed exponentially vi = 100 \u2212 99 exp (\u2212 | Ts \u2212 24 | 10) as the sensor temperature approaches the target temperature; the commercial controller is based on a commercial specification, which tends to use lower fan rates than the proportional controller, probably to avoid noise and vibration, but is otherwise quite similar."}, {"heading": "4.2. Simple fuzzy logic controller", "text": "For evaluation, a simple fuzzy logic controller was implemented in Java using the Fuzzylite library version 1.0 (Rada-Vilela, 2014). In addition to the sensor temperature Ts, this controller also receives the internal mass temperature Tm. Fuzzy set functions for input temperatures Ts, Tm are neutral (24 \u00b1 1 \u00b0 C), cold (below neutral) and hot (top) with some increased overlaps between the individual ranges. For ventilation temperatures, the rates are low (below 10 \u00b0 C), medium (about 20 \u00b0 C), high (above 30 \u00b0 C) and for ventilation flow rates low (below 30 \u00b0 C \u2212 1), medium (about 50 \u00b0 C \u2212 1) and high (above 70 \u00b0 C \u2212 1) with similarly rapid overlapps.The fuzzy logic rules are summarized in Figure 5. These rules are slightly modified from those of Dalamagkidis et al. (2007) and Kelly and Pawlak (2003)."}, {"heading": "4.3. Results", "text": "The relative performance of the RL controller compared to that of the hand-coded controllers is shown in Table 3. The RL controller provides the largest (least negative) average reward per step, consumes less power and provides more convenience. This performance develops during learning, as shown in Figure 6. The RL controller achieves an average reward of \u2212 1.2 after 200,000 learning phases (about 6.3 simulated years). Learning for the Sarsa (\u03bb) algorithm (implemented in Java) corresponds to 200,000 episodes completed in 85 minutes with a 2.9 GHz Intel \u00ae Core \u2122 i7 processor. These results result in an average energy saving of 37% compared to the test scenarios established compared to the simple, fuzzy-logic-based controller, while thermal comfort was achieved and successfully maintained. Figure 7 shows how each controller controls the occupant ET in a cooling scenario (45 \u00b0 C cabin temperature, 45 \u00b0 C air intake and some block temperature is caused by blocking air)."}, {"heading": "4.3.1. Effect of parameter choices", "text": "For example, Figure 8 shows how the mean reward changes with the learning rate \u03b1 over the episodes 1000-2000 000 and that a rate of 0.01 produces the fastest learning. Similar experiments show the best values for \u03bb (0.98) and \u03b5 (0.16). Although these parameter selections are suitable in early learning stages, other values may be better later on. In particular, the reward performance improves considerably when exploration is turned off in later learning stages. The black line drawn in the diagram corresponds to the target curve (or Pareto optimal front) and shows a progressive change in the balance between comfort and energy as the energy divisor values are increased in terms of energy consumption and percentage comfort."}, {"heading": "5. Discussion", "text": "Firstly, not all factors relevant to thermal comfort are simulated or included in the ET comfort measurement, such as humidity, clothing level or metabolic work rate of the subject. If a particular thermal comfort model leads to sub-optimal comfort when implemented as a control, this implies that there may be a problem with the comfort model, as it also helps to detect window fogging and thus include a penalty for fogging in the reward function. Given the diversity of opinions on comfort models and the relative importance of parameters in the literature, this iterative approach seems to be best. Secondly, the hand-coded controls presented in this paper may imply a problem with the comfort model and thus help to identify which parameter or feature is missing."}, {"heading": "5.1. Pathway to implementation in the car", "text": "The occupant ET, which is used here as a proxy for comfort, cannot be measured directly in a real vehicle cabin, and the need for a proxy inspired the development of a Virtual Thermal Comfort Sensor (VTCS) (Hintea et al., 2013). VTCS uses a distributed set of sensors to estimate comfort based on a machine learning approach. Note that all learning takes place offline and therefore little calculation is required to implement the VTCS approach in the car. In principle, VTCS can be used to estimate comfort for different zones such as the upper and lower body as well as different passenger positions. An important consideration when designing a controller is the accuracy of the sensor. No matter how good the controller is, inaccurate measurements lead to incorrect control. The VTCS approach has the added advantage of making it possible to integrate a range of cost-effective sensors rather than relying on a single sensor."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions and future work", "text": "Our results show that the RL-based controller offers better comfort (67% time in comfort versus 55% for the Bang-Bang controller with averaged sensor) and is more efficient (0.77 kW for the RL controller versus 0.88 kW for the Bang-Bang controller). Note that the exact level of energy consumption differs from this in practice because the energy consumption aspect of the simulation has not been fully validated. The performance of the RL controller is noteworthy for two reasons: first, the reward function is not \"coach\" of the solution; the reward occurs only when comfort is attained; second, the RL controller is not explicitly informed about the current ET, but manages to control it in a stable manner."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The Low Carbon Vehicle Technology Project (LCVTP) was a joint research project of leading automotive companies and research partners that revolutionised the way vehicles are powered and manufactured.
