In the FCN architecture, the classification network is first transformed into a fully revolutionary network, to which an upsampling or de-convolutional layer is then added to make pixel-by-pixel predictions. FCN training is an end-to-end supervised learning process and image segmentation is performed using a voxel-by-by-pixel prediction / classification. FCN-8s constructed from FCN-16s skip over the net and FCN-32s rough net. Predictions in flat layers are made using a skip layer, which combines rough predictions in deep layers to improve segmentation details. Specifically, in our experiment, the FCN-8s is then converted to the sum of two predictions on top of the 16x of the last layer of the prediction of the 16x of the prediction layer of the 16x of the last layer."}, {"heading": "2.3 Spatial texton features", "text": ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"}, {"heading": "2.4 RF classification", "text": "Random Forests (RF) are among the most powerful classifiers [16] and are an interplay of several decision trees. Each node of a tree contains a set of training examples and a predictor. At each attribute split, a random subset of characteristics is selected, during which the RF is applied, based on the ROI recognized by the FCN. A confidence span of 10 voxels in the 3D space around the detected tumor area is selected by morphological dilatation. The optimal value for voxels in this target area is fed to the random forests for training. The most important parameters when designing RF are the number of trees, tree depth, and the number of attributes (catattribute) that are selected to perform the random split. The optimal value for catattribute for the classification tasks is Catattribute = \u221a Nfeature, where Nfeature is the total number of characteristics in our study attribute 7. = RF-parameters of the tree segments are assigned by the number of data pieces."}, {"heading": "3 Experimental Results and Discussion", "text": "This year it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "This paper proposes a learning-based automatic method for segmentation of brain tumors in MRI images.
