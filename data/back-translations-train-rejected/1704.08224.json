Regular conclusions produce a fluid caption that is relevant to the image but does not attempt to be witty. Witty Mismatch is a human-mental caption, but for an image other than the one being evaluated. This baseline leads to mental superiority, but it does not attempt to be relevant to the image. Ambiguous is a \"sharp\" caption in which a boring (regular) word is replaced by its counterpart. This caption will probably contain content that is relevant to the image, but it is not relevant to the image or to the rest of the caption."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "Since wit involves the unexpected, the goal of describing an image in a witty way often leads to a trade-off between the witty description and the image-relevant description. Another interesting factor that can influence perceived humor is presentation. For example, the text in cartoons and memes is funny in its characteristic, informal font, but boring in other, more \"serious\" fonts. Creating a description for an image that is perceived as funny is a challenge because the description has to strike the fine balance between simple resolution by the perceiver without being impossible or too trivial. However, there are other challenges. For example, automatic image recognition and capture models are still imperfect despite major advances in recent times. In our approach, these are cascading sources of error that could affect the perceived wit of an image description."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We introduced novel mathematical models to solve the challenging task of creating contextually funny descriptions for a particular image. We use linguistic puns, especially puns in both on-demand and generational models. We evaluate our models based on meaningful basic approaches to human studies.
