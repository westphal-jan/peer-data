With improved sequencing techniques, increasing attempts have been conducted to hide hidden messages in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences which have been become a medium for steganography. Many detection schemes have developed for conventional digital data, but these schemes not applicable to DNA sequences because of DNA's complex internal structures. In this paper, we propose the first DNA steganalysis framework for detecting hidden messages and conduct an experiment based on the random oracle model. Among the suitable models for the framework, splice junction classification using deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is most appropriate for performing DNA steganalysis. In our DNA steganography approach, we extract the hidden layer composed of RNNs to model the internal structure of a DNA sequence. We provide security for steganography schemes based on mutual entropy and provide simulation results that illustrate how our model detects hidden messages, independent of regions of a targeted reference genome. We apply our method to human genome datasets and determine that hidden messages in DNA sequences with a minimum sample size of 100 are detectable, regardless of the presence of hidden regions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 06:16:30 GMT  (5284kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08443v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["ho bae", "byunghan lee", "sunyoung kwon", "sungroh yoon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08443"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.08443.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "DNA Steganalysis Using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks", "authors": ["Ho Bae", "Byunghan Lee", "Sunyoung Kwon", "Sungroh Yoon"], "emails": ["sryoon@snu.ac.kr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Key concepts Deep recurrent neural network, DNA steganography, DNA bar analysis"}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "2 BACKGROUND", "text": "In molecular biology, DNA information is transformed from DNA by transcription into RNA and protein by translation. According to the genetic code, four types of nucleotides (A, C, G and T) are transformed into 20 types of amino acids, with the exception of three stop codons (TAA, TAG and TGA). One mRNA corresponds to DNA, except that in RNA T is replaced by uracil (U). In 4 nucleotides, 43 = 64 possible combinations of codon exist, whereas only 20 amino acids exist. Translation of several codons into individual amino acids allows degeneration in the genetic code. For example, throonine can be derived from ACU, ACC, ACA and ACG, and the third base has no influence on protein sequence translation."}, {"heading": "2.1 Steganography", "text": "Originals le can be text, image, audio or DNA sequences. A he hidden messages are embedded, an original le is called a stolen medium. It is used as a communication channel to conceal the existence of the message itself, making it a cult for a third party. In addition, the steganography scheme can also be used as a watermark for intellectual property. E-signature in the watermark indicates the possession of the data and ensures copyright protection. Hiding a message in a DNA sequence was first proposed using a microdot technique [14]. Leier et al. [35] proposed a robust encryption scheme that was first proposed by Clelland et al. [14] and has gained popularity in the last 10 years. E-scheme for hiding data in a DNA sequence was first proposed using a microdot technique [14]. Leier et al. [35] suggested a key sequence to be used as a public encryption scheme, and a key sequence is used in the DNA sequence."}, {"heading": "2.2 Steganalysis", "text": "Step analysis works in two ways. The first method involves the removal of the watermark (s) that are processed by scanning. the second method involves compression while part of a cipher text is detected by frequency or entropy measurements. Traditional methods of hiding data usually embed a secret message in the images and audio files [56, 58]. However, with the advent of detection schemes, even very small distortions of images can be easily detected [53]. However, conventional methods of DNA Steg Analysis do not work with DNA Steganography. This is because a biochemical approach is required to extract DNA sequences and a biological process (transcription / translation) makes it impossible to encrypt / decrypt secret messages."}, {"heading": "2.3 Determination of Message-Hiding Regions", "text": "Genomic sequences contain both exons (encoding regions) and introns (non-encoding regions), and two regions are used depending on whether it is a task of data storage or transport. Intron regions are a candidate for transport, as not all regions in RNA regions are transcribed and removed by splicing [28, 36] during transcription. Functionality provides enormous space for hiding data, creating potential hidden channels. In contrast, the data must be resistant to degradation or truncation in the data storage (watermark). exons are a suitable candidate for storage, as the sequences are transferred via a translation and transcription process. two components of internal structures in eukaryote genes are shown in the DNA steganography as payload (watermark) or carriers (covered channels). Using DNA sequences as payload algorithms or payload algorithms are not divided into two regions, as shown in table 1, each of payload algorithms or in gut algorithms."}, {"heading": "3 METHODS", "text": "Our proposed method uses RNNs to detect hidden messages in DNA and is a new method in the field of bar analysis. Figure 2 provides an overview of our proposed method, which consists of three phases: 1) species identification, 2) education and 3) recognition. In species identification, we discover its candidate species for a given object, regardless of whether the query contains hidden messages. In the model training phase, we build a model based on its reference sequences Di-D for the selected species i from the public database. In the detection phase, we obtain a probability of the random sequence mi-Di from the training phase and repeat it until it achieves an overwhelming probability. Finally, during the test phase, we obtain the test probability with the specified object."}, {"heading": "3.1 Notations", "text": "We use the standard terminology of hiding information [2] to give a brief explanation of this section. \u2022 Two hypothetical parties, Alice and Bob, wish to communicate between two restricted sequence laboratories. \u2022 A message between them is not sent when the third party captures their secret message in a DNA sequence nds. \u2022 Alice and Bob use existing steganography schemes to hide their secret message, and the third party uses our proposed model to capture the secret message. \u2022 D = {D 1, \u00b7, D} is a series of DNA sequences n species in which Di represents the i-th species of DNA sequences. \u2022 D = {D 1, \u00b7, \u00b7, D-n} is an encryption that is encrypted."}, {"heading": "3.2 Proposed DNA Steganalysis", "text": "In fact, it is a matter of how people are able to determine themselves how they want to live.

[33] However, intron and exon regions are used depending on whether this is a data storage or transport task, as explained above. We should note that the splice connection approach based on intron / exon modelling is more suitable for detecting hidden messages in both regions than the sequence analysis method."}, {"heading": "3.4 Proposed Steganalysis Model", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to set out in search of new ways to conquer the world."}, {"heading": "4 RESULTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experiment Setup", "text": "This year it is so far that it will be able to take the lead at a time when it is not as far as it has been in recent years, \"he said."}, {"heading": "4.2 Detection Performance on Sample Sizes", "text": "Figure 5 shows an experiment for each algorithm with six sample sizes (100, 200, 300, 500 and 1000). Each algorithm was compared with three different regions based on the six sample sizes. E experiments were performed by changing one percent of the hidden messages. SVM showed good detection performance in the exon region, but both regions performed well, except for some modification rates. In the intron regions, detection performance was in both regions and only in the intron regions, but in the exon regions it was poorly performed."}, {"heading": "4.3 Variation of Detection Performance", "text": "To validate the learning algorithms in terms of robustness, we tested them with a set sample size of 100 with 500 cases for each modification rate to measure the mean and variance of test accuracy. Figure 7 shows how the performance metrics (mean and variance of accuracy differences) change for modification rates from 1 to 10 in the introns, exons, and both regions. Each plotted entry is an average across the 500 cases, and shading lines show an average of variances above 500 traps. e results suggest that hidden messages may not be detected if the predictive probability is less than variance. an overall analysis of robustness showed that the learning algorithms of SVM, random forests, and adaptive boosting performed poorly. RNNs was the only model compared to other learning algorithms that never showed excellent detection across all three regions with modification rates."}, {"heading": "5 DISCUSSION", "text": "Next-generation sequencing has lowered the price of personal genomics [45], and the discovery of the CRIPSPR-Cas9 gene has made it possible to reconstruct DNA sequences [24]. e technology is not yet available to simulate arti cial DNA. However, human DNA sequences can become an object to which we can apply DNA watermarks. In this thesis, we have proposed the first general DNA bar analysis method to detect hidden messages in DNA sequences. Our experiments with the real human genome hg38 implicitly take into account that unknown relevant sequences are also due to the properties of similar pas in non-canonical splice sites. a number of donors with GT pairs and acceptors with AG pairs have been found to be detectable 86.32% and 84.63%, respectively. Machine learning based on stegan analysis utilizes the following facts: \u2022 No previous statistical models are required. \u2022 A reasonably accurate verification rate can be achieved."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "Our contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 A new DNA bar analysis method is proposed using RNNs. \u2022 Increased robustness is achieved through unattended to monitored learning. \u2022 An improved method detects hidden messages while recognizing canonical / non-canonical signals that are overlooked in sequence analysis. We believe that adopting our methodology will expand the scope of DNA bar analysis. For future work, we plan to expand our model by automated hyperparameter tuning and apply it to different sets of data in DNA sequences."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was funded

Many detection schemes have developed for conventional digital data, but these schemes not applicable to DNA sequences because of DNA\u2019s complex internal structures. In this paper, we propose the \u0080rst DNA steganalysis framework for detecting hidden messages and conduct an experiment based on the random oracle model. Among the suitable models for the framework, splice junction classi\u0080cation using deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is most appropriate for performing DNA steganalysis . In our DNA steganography approach, we extract the hidden layer composed of RNNs to model the internal structure of a DNA sequence. We provide security for steganography schemes based on mutual entropy and provide simulation results that illustrate how our model detects hidden messages, independent of regions of a targeted reference genome. We apply our method to human genome datasets and determine that hidden messages in DNA sequences with a minimum sample size of 100 are detectable, regardless of the presence of hidden regions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
