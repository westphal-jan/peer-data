A ranking is a list of sorted terms in which an item with a lower ranking is rated. Retrieving information is a typical example of the use of rankings in which a ranking result is returned as a result of ordered documents after a query. Automatic suggestions, an important part of search engines nowadays, produce a ranking of search terms according to one or two keystrokes to provide a better search experience.The problem with consensus ranking measurement is the quantification of the degree to which rankings match according to certain common patterns. Formally, a set of R = {r1, \u00b7 \u00b7 rN} of N rankings consists of quantifying and evaluating the commonalities."}, {"heading": "2 Ranking sequences and patterns", "text": "A ranking is often shown as a sequence of ordered items in which an item with a lower position in the order is not used.

Table 1 shows 12 rankings from the two search engines, in which each search engine has 6 rankings corresponding to the 6 keywords. In the 12 rankings, we get a total of 98 unique links, of which Bing provides 59 unique links and Google 60 unique links. The aim of this experiment is to evaluate the search results based on the proposed measure of \"kinship\" or \"proximity\" with the specified conceptually related keywords. Table 2 shows the results from which we can find out that the six rankings consist of the Bing links, each having the least common (R = 8) while Google has the least common (R = 8)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "This paper discusses the consensus benchmarks for a given set of rankings to understand the extent to which the rankings match and the extent to which the rankings are related to each other.
