In this paper, for the first time, it is applied to BCI regression problems, an important category of BCI applications. More specifically, we propose a new feature extraction approach for Electroencephalogram (EEG) based BCI regression problems: a spatial filter is first used to increase the signal quality of the EEG trials and also to reduce the dimensionality of the covariance matrices, and then Riemannian tangent space features are extracted. We validate the performance of the proposed approach in reaction time estimation from EEG signals measured in a large-scale sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task, and show that compared with the traditional powerband features, the tangent space features can reduce the root mean square estimation error by 4.30-8.30%, and increase the estimation correlation coefficient by 6.59-11.13%.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 12:30:05 GMT  (456kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08533v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1702.02914"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1702.02914", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["dongrui wu", "brent j lance", "vernon j lawhern", "stephen gordon", "tzyy-ping jung", "chin-teng lin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08533"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.08533.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "EEG-Based User Reaction Time Estimation Using Riemannian Geometry Features", "authors": ["Dongrui Wu"], "emails": ["drwu09@gmail.com,", "brent.j.lance.civ@mail.mil,", "vernon.j.lawhern.civ@mail.mil,", "sgordon@dcscorp.com,", "jung@sccn.ucsd.edu,", "Chin-Teng.Lin@uts.edu.au"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take one year to move on to the next round."}, {"heading": "II. SPATIAL FILTERING FOR SUPERVISED BCI REGRESSION PROBLEMS", "text": "Recently, we have proposed two spatial filters for the verified BCI regression problems, which have been extended by the Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). They have similar performance and computational costs. One of them, CSP for regression - one against the other (CSPR-OVR), is briefly presented in this section, as the RG characteristics are better extracted from the spatially filtered EEG data than the raw EEG data. Let Xn (n = 1,..., N) denote the nth EEG study in the training data, where C is the number of channels and S is the number of time samples. We assume that the mean of each channel measurement has been removed, which is normally done by bandpass filtering. Let yn R be the corresponding RT of the nth trial. CSPR-OVR first constructs K fuzzy sets."}, {"heading": "III.

Riemannian Geometry", "text": "The RG approach for BCI works on the covariance matrices of the EEG studies, both of which are symmetrically positive-defined and form a differentiable, manifold M [20] with dimensionality R (R + 1) / 2, where R is the number of rows (columns) of the covariance matrices. Consequently, we must apply the Riemannian metrics instead of the traditional euclidean metrics, which are more suitable for flat spaces of the vectors. In particular, we are interested in the distance measurement between two covariance matrices, since many machine learning methods rely on such distances. The Riemannian distance between two covariance matrices RR and the Riemannian elements RR, which are called the geodesic element."}, {"heading": "B.

Once the training is completed, the feature extraction for a test experiment can be performed very efficiently: First, a matrix multiplication (5) is used to filter it spatially, and then another matrix multiplication (11) to calculate its spatial covariance matrix (s); finally, Logm (2) is used and the upper triangular part is used as a feature."}, {"heading": "100 LASSO, FS1 LASSO, FS2", "text": "LASSO, FS3RMSE in training1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 AvgSubject00.2 0.4 LASSO, FS1 LASSO, FS2 LASSO, FS3CC in training1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16AvgSubject0.60.8 LASSO, FS1 LASSO, FS2 LASSO, FS3Fig. 9.

RT versus Fatigue State", "text": "We also investigated the relationship between the RT and the fatigue state. Our assumption is that the RT should be greater as the level of fatigue increases. RT box plots in different sessions for two typical subjects are shown in Fig. 11, where \"L,\" \"N\" and \"H\" respectively mean low, normal and high fatigue. Fig. 11 shows that the mean RT of a session with high fatigue is generally greater than that of a session with low or normal fatigue, and the former also has more extreme values and greater variance. The difference between a session with low fatigue and a session with normal fatigue is not obvious."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a new approach to feature extraction for EEG-based BCI regression problems: First, a spatial filter is used to increase the quality of the EEG test signal and also to decrease the dimensionality of the covariance matrix, and then Rieman tangential space characteristics are extracted. We validated the performance of the proposed approach in the RT estimation from EEG signals measured in a large-scale PVT experiment, and showed that tangential space characteristics can reduce the RMSE estimate by 4.30-8.30% and increase the CC estimate by 6.59-11.13% compared to traditional powerband characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that RG is used in BCI regression problems. Our future research will focus on reducing the dimensionality of tangential space characteristics and increasing the CC estimate by 6.59-11.13%. As shown in Algorithm 3, the RTF (where tangential space characteristics are fast)."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "The research was funded by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and conducted under the Cooperative Agreement Numbers W911NF-10-2-0022 and W911NF-10-D-0002 / TO 0023.

used in many brain-computer interface (BCI) classification problems and demonstrated superior performance. In this paper, for the first time, it is applied to BCI regression problems, an important category of BCI applications. More specifically, we propose a new feature extraction approach for Electroencephalogram (EEG) based BCI regression problems: a spatial filter is first used to increase the signal quality of the EEG trials and also to reduce the dimensionality of the covariance matrices, and then Riemannian tangent space features are extracted. We validate the performance of the proposed approach in reaction time estimation from EEG signals measured in a large-scale sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task, and show that compared with the traditional powerband features, the tangent space features can reduce the root mean square estimation error by 4.30-8.30%, and increase the estimation correlation coefficient by 6.59-11.13%.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
