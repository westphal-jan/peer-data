Fig. 10 shows the FM representation of the conceptual spheres involved. The car enters the station (1) and as soon as the car is received there, the car also arrives conceptually, in the spheres of robot 1 and robot 2 (2 and 3). Physically, the car is thus in the sphere of the station, and it is also in the two conceptual spheres of the robots. Fig. 11 shows possible \"significant\" events (with time slots) of this example. \"Significant\" refers here to significant events in the modeled context. For example, the event of the transfer of the car through the station door (the transmission stage (1) is not as interesting as the event of the transmission and reception of air to the station 4)."}, {"heading": "EVENTS AND CAUSES", "text": "This section deals with the use of FM in causal situations.

John in his walking slowly implies that the first event takes place in a certain region, but it is true that if the second event did not take place, the first event did not take place either. In order to avoid the uncomfortable conclusion that the second event is the first, Lewis says that we should not distinguish the two events from each other."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "While the modeled situation of reality produces a static description, events inject the dynamic behavior of the system. Accordingly, the representation of the dimension of time at this dynamic level allows the representation of simultaneous events (e.g. two robots working on the same object at the same time). Finally, the proposed representation of events seems to help explain some causal problems, such as the relationship between an event and another event that involves it. While the essay represents a new direction in alternative representations of events, we can conclude that the approach is potentially practicable to be experienced within the manifold fields that encompass the concept of events. Further research in a specific application of the approach will support our assertion of the benefits of the proposed representation."}], "references": [{"title": "Event Concepts", "author": ["R.

An event plays a prominent role in various areas of philosophy, from metaphysics to the philosophy of action and mind, as well as in such diverse disciplines as linguistics, literary theory, probability theory, artificial intelligence, physics, and\u2014of course\u2014history. This plethora of concerns and applications is indicative of the prima facie centrality of the notion of an event in our conceptual scheme. [1] According to [2], Whitehead [3] affirmed that everything is an event. The world is made of events and nothing but events. Even a solid object is an event; or, better, a multiplicity and a series of events. There has been a continuous debate concerning how events should be conceptualized [4]. Common sense says events are concrete, nonrepeatable entities with a specific location and duration [1]. Some theories treat events as properties or tropes, whereas others view events as special theoretical entities [1]. An event can also be viewed as a theoretical posit in which entities are not explicitly represented or visible in the involved representation [1]. Recent developments in diagrammatic conceptual modeling have made it possible to explore the conceptual representation of an event. This paper examines some aspects of the notion of events that result from a new methodology of diagrammatic representation. Specifically, the emphasis in the proposed representation of events is on its interaction with the concepts of time and space, objects. The results of this nontechnical research could be utilized in many fields. The notion of an event is typically used in scientific practice for its latitude, which allows for interdisciplinary circulation and theoretical track-keeping (These terms are from [1]). In some broad sense we do expect results of research about events ... to be at least partially commensurable across disciplines and across time, and this is why researchers tend to go along with umbrella notions rather than more technically refined concepts. [1] The proposed method of event representation will be based on a diagrammatic model, called the flowthing machine (FM) model, which will be reviewed briefly in the next section. The FM has been utilized as a modeling tool in several fields, such as software engineering, business processes, and engineering design [5-8]. FLOWTHINGS MACHINE (FM) The FM model is a diagrammatic schema that uses flowthings (hereafter, things), defined as what can be created, released, transferred, processed, and received by means of stages of a flow machine (see Fig. 1). The machine is a generalization of the typical input-process-output model used in many scientific fields (Fig. 2). Things flow through the stages of the machine when they are created by the machine or imported from other machines. Each type of thing has its own machine. For example, events are things (i.e., that are being created or processed) that flow in their machines, which include submachines such as time and things that are being \u201ceventulized,\u201d i.e., going through events. Figure 2. Input-process-output model Process Output Input Figure 1. Flow machine Create Receive Transfer Release Process Accept Arrive Output Input The machine is the conceptual fiber used to handle (change though stages) flowthings from their inception or arrival to their de-creation or transmission). Machines form the organizational structure (environment) of whatever is described; especially, in our study, events, time, objects. The machines are embedded in a network of assemblies called spheres in which the processes of the machines take place. The stages in Fig. 1 can be described as follows: Arrival: A thing reaches a new machine. Acceptance: A thing is approved to enter a machine. If arriving things are always accepted, Arrived and Accepted can be combined as a Reception stage. Processing (changed): The thing goes through some kind of transformation that changes it without creating a new thing. Release: A thing is marked as ready to be transferred outside the machine. Transfer: The thing is transported somewhere from/to outside the machine. Creation: A new thing is born (created) in a machine. In general, a flow machine is thought to be an abstract machine that receives, processes, creates, releases, and transfers things. The stages are mutually exclusive. An additional stage of Storage can also be added to any machine to represent the storage of things; however, storage is not an exclusive stage because there can be stored processed flowthings, stored created flowthings, etc. Flow machines also use the notions of spheres and subspheres. These are the network environments and relationships of machines and submachines. Multiple machines can exist in a sphere if needed. A sphere can be a person, an organ, an entity (e.g., a company, a customer), a location (a laboratory, a waiting room), a communication medium (a channel, a wire). A machine is a subsphere that embodies the flow; it itself has no subspheres. FM also utilizes the notion of triggering. Triggering is the activation of a flow, denoted in the machine diagrams by a dashed arrow. It is a dependency relationship among flows and parts of flows. A flow is said to be triggered if it is created or activated by another flow (e.g., a flow of electricity triggers a flow of heat), or activated by another point in the flow. Triggering can also be used to initiate events such as starting up a machine (e.g., remote signal to turn on). Multiple machines can interact by triggering events related to other machines in those machines\u2019 spheres and stages Example: According to Shaviro [2], for Whitehead [3] the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle on the Victoria Embankment in London is a series of events. Cleopatra\u2019s Needle is actively happening. It never remains the same. \u201cA physicist who looks on that part of the life of nature as a dance of electrons, will tell you that daily it has lost some molecules and gained others, and even the plain man can see that it gets dirtier and is occasionally washed\u201d [3]. At every instant, the mere standing-in-place of Cleopatra\u2019s Needle is an event: a renewal, a novelty, a fresh creation. [2] Fig. 3 shows the corresponding structural/static description. The Cleopatra\u2019s Needle is created and processed and takes its course as a thing (circle 1 in the figure). Its electronics dance (2) and its molecules come and go (3) in the eyes of the physicist (4). Dirt flows on it and is cleaned off (5) in the eyes of the layman (6). A dynamical description is shown in Fig. 4 (it embeds Fig. 3). A series of events (1, 7, 8, ...) creates and re-creates the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle. Event 1 (yellow box in the online version of the paper) is a thing in its machine that is created and processed (1). Its creation triggers (2) the appearance (creation) of the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle with its electronics and dirt. The event has its time (3) that triggers (4) the event creation. Time flows to create its slices (5), (6), which triggers events (7), (8), which in turn trigger the re-creation of the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle (9), (10), etc. Figure 3.
