Twitter has a large and diverse user base that includes rich textual content. 6 tweets have a lot of non-standard language such as emoticons, emojis, creatively spelled words (happee), hashtags (# takingastand, # lonely) and linked words (loveumom). Tweets are often used to convey emotions, opinions on products and attitudes about topics. Therefore, the emotion analysis of tweets is particularly compact. As most words do not convey specific emotion to a pronounced extent, the annotation of all words is suboptimal for all emotions. Thus, for each of the eight emotions we have created separate lists of terms that fulfill either one of the two characteristics we list below: 6Twitter is a social networking and microblogging service where users post messages and tweet up to 140 characters are called The Word."}, {"heading": "3.2 Annotating for Affect Intensity with Best\u2013Worst Scaling", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "4 Reliability of the Annotations", "text": "One cannot use the standard interannotator agreement to determine the quality of the BVS annotations, because the disagreement that arises when a tuple has two points close to each other in emotional intensity is a useful signal for BVS. Therefore, if respondents are unable to uniformly identify the word with the highest (or lowest) emotion intensity, the disagreement results in the two words receiving similar values, which is the desired result. Therefore, a different measure of the quality of the annotations must be used. A useful measure of quality is the reproducibility of the end result - if repeated independent manual annotations by several respondents lead to similar intensity values, then one can be sure that the values capture the true emotion intensities. To evaluate this reproducibility, we calculate the average split-half reliability (SHR) over 100 studies. SHR is a commonly used approach to determine the consistency of the two points we are following in our two observations."}, {"heading": "5 Applications", "text": "Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez (2017) demonstrate their usefulness in automatically determining the intensity of the emotions transmitted by tweets. They also comment on a data set of tweets in terms of the degree (or intensity) of the emotions experienced by the speaker - the Tweet Emotion Intensity Dataset. The lexicon can be used together with the Tweet Emotion Intensity Dataset to investigate the interplay between the tweet Emotional intensity and the intensity of the words that make up the tweet. The lexicon also has applications in the fields of digital humanities and literary analysis, where it can be used to identify high-intensity words. The NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon can also be used as a source of Gold Intensity Scores to evaluate automatic methods of determining word intensity."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We created the NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon, a broad-ranging lexicon that captures the intensity of word effects for eight basic emotions. We used the best-worst-scaling (BWS) technique to obtain fine-grained values (and word rankings) and address issues of the consistency of notes that plague traditional methods of the annotation scale. We show that repeated annotations of terms in the Affect Intensity Lexicon with independent annotations result in association values that are close to the values originally obtained (Spearman Rank correlations of 0.92; Pearson correlation: 0.91). The fine-grained evaluation achieved with BWS and the high correlations in repetition compositions suggest that BWS is both discriminatory (helps to detect slight differences in affect intensity) and highly reliable (delivers stable results). The lexicon has applications in both the automated composition of words and the constituting effect of words."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Many thanks to Svetlana Kirichenko and Tara Small for helpful talks."}], "references": [{"title": "Affective norms for English words (ANEW): Instruction manual and affective ratings", "author": ["Margaret M Bradley", "Peter J Lang."], "venue": "Technical report, The Center for Research in Psychophysiology, University of Florida.", "citeRegEx": "Bradley and Lang.,? 1999", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bradley and Lang.", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Web 1t 5-gram version 1", "author": ["Thorsten Brants", "Alex Franz."], "venue": "Linguistic Data Consortium .", "citeRegEx": "Brants and Franz.,? 2006", "shortCiteRegEx": "Brants and Franz.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Maximum difference scaling: Improved measures of importance and preference for segmentation", "author": ["Steven H.
