Therefore, the population of individuals is divided into several strains. Initialization and evolutionary operations are intended to ensure that the number of individuals selecting a certain number of traits follows a Gaussian distribution (,) in each tribe. Therefore, the tribe is primarily responsible for researching a part of the solution space where the number of selected traits ranges from \u2212 3 to + 3. Since the traits that make up the global optimum must exist in the subspaces sought by one or two elite strains, the competition between strains is introduced into evolution to predict the elite tribe. The size of the predicted elite tribe increased to give it more searchability, and the size of the tribe reduced by the number of worms being passed through."}, {"heading": "2. Algorithm", "text": "As a heuristically oriented parallel and stochastic search approach, TCbGA seeks a globally optimal subset of candidate characteristics through the development of a population of individuals. Each individual encodes a trait selection scheme using binary coding and has a fitness defined as classification accuracy, which is achieved by applying these selected characteristics to the linear SVM [32] in 10-fold cross-validation. Since it is difficult to estimate how many characteristics are selected in the global optimal solution, and without this value traditional binary coded GA tends to select approximately 2-fold characteristics, we divide the solution space into overlapping subspaces and accordingly divide the population equally into strains exploring a subspace. These strains develop in two-tiered sequence. In the intra-tribal evolutionary step, each strain develops independently and the highest fitness therein improves as the new generations of the tribe mutually modify the pre-selective, mutually selective, mutually mutually selective, and mutually adaptive fitness processes."}, {"heading": "2.1 Initialization", "text": "However, the TCbGA aims to identify the person with the highest fitness out of the solution space by simultaneously developing into a tribe. We assume that the number of people belonging to a tribe can be calculated in the same way as the number of people belonging to a tribe are evenly distributed in the range [1, 2]. The mean largely determines which part of the solution space is examined by the tribe, and the standard deviation regulates the search area of each tribe. During initialization, we create random individuals and select some of them the tribe."}, {"heading": "2.2 Intra-Tribe Evolution", "text": "In the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the third quarter there was then another confrontation between the two teams, which occurred in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the second quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter in the second half of the third quarter."}, {"heading": "2.3 Inter-Tribe Competition", "text": "Tribal competition occurs when all tribes independently develop two generations, and is reflected in the change in tribal size. In this step, we collect the elites of all tribes and sort them according to their fitness. On the contrary, the tribes with high elites will probably not work in the right places and should therefore release some of their resources to the most capable. There are various strategies to adjust the size of the tribes to the competition outcome. In this study, we choose to increase the size of the tribe by one with the best elitists and accordingly reduce the size of the tribe with the worst elitists by one. Specifically, one individual will expand the enlarged tribe and one individual will discard the shrunken tribe, which would result in a reduction in the size of the tribe with the worst elitists by one. Specifically, an individual will supplement the enlarged tribe and an individual the shrunk tribe."}, {"heading": "3.

Each time, the trait subset specified by a person is used to train a classifier and test its accuracy by cross-validation. Therefore, the computational complexity is also determined by the number of candidate traits, the number of classes and the number of instances. More instances and classes usually require more calculation, and more candidate traits can lead to large selected characteristic substances and therefore also require a higher calculation. Table 10 indicates the average time cost of training the model and testing an instance on seven data sets (Intel Core i7-4790 CPU 3.2GHz, NVidia GTX Titan X GPU, 32GB of memory and Matlab version 2014). Although the off-line problems are extremely time consuming, we believe that the classification of the proposed features for optimal application of the classification is becoming more efficient."}, {"heading": "4.5 Feasibility", "text": "As a result, if the number of candidate characteristics is small, we can have little advantage over other approaches. We used the WBCD dataset as a case study in which there are 699 cases of two classes and each instance consists of nine characteristics. Since there are only 29 \u2212 1 possible feature subsets in this problem, we can find the optimal feature subset with respect to different classifiers by exhaustive search. Table 11 indicates the classification accuracy and time taken by the proposed algorithm and an exhaustive search. It shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve optimal classification accuracy, but can take even more time than an exhaustive search. Thus, if the number of candidate characteristics is too small, it may not be necessary to use multiple strains to search different parts of the solution space, especially if the solution space can be exhaustively explored. < Number of strains (< 37.6066)"}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we propose the TCbGA algorithm for trait selection in pattern classification, which divides the population into several tribes, each containing a cohort of individuals. We code each individual as a binary string to represent a possible trait selection scheme, and modify the initialization and evolutionary operations to ensure that the number of selected traits in each tribe follows a Gaussian distribution. In addition to developing each tribe, we are introducing a tribal competition to allow elite individuals an increased search power. Our results suggest that the proposed algorithm exceeds several state-of-the-art selection approaches to 20 benchmark datasets. Our future work will focus on integrating classifier selection into the optimization process, reducing complexity, and expanding this algorithm to solve trait selection problems with a large set of features."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 61471297 and 61231016, and in part by the Returned Overseas Scholar Project of Shaanxi Province, China.
