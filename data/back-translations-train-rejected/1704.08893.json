In addition, we present CCR, the framework that underlies the theoretical mapping of the relationships between PDTB and RST.

To illustrate this, we look at Figure 2, which includes the PDTB (left) and RST (right) annotations to a fragment of a Wall Street Journal article. In PDTB, the segments (a-b) and (c) are associated in a TEMPORAL.SYNCHRONY relationship. In RST, a similar TEMPORAL-SAME-TIME relationship is commented on between the segments (b) and (c), although the voltage ranges are slightly different, they represent each other, and none of the arguments contain multiple relations (RST).The remaining 47% of the successfully mapped data consists of relationships, which for this tree is the RTB-complex relationship as the PTB-word relationship."}, {"heading": "4.2 Data that was excluded because of alignment", "text": "This year, it is at an all-time high in the history of the European Union."}, {"heading": "5. Correspondence between mapped relation labels", "text": "These results are presented in tables with lighter and darker colors, also known as heat maps, the colors representing percentage concordance: darker colors mean a higher concordance between the two frameworks for a given label. To keep the tables readable, we only include the labels that occurred more than ten times in the data. We discuss explicit and then implicit discourse relationships first. In this mapping, we can look at both mapping directions separately, i.e. we map PDTB labels on RST labels, as opposed to RST labels on PDTB labels (the results differ due to different granularities in distinctions between discourse relationship classes).With this mapping, we can take stock of whether our hypothetical matches match matches match the actual labels, and identify areas that require additional careful time considerations."}, {"heading": "5.1 Mapping PDTB annotations onto RST annotations for explicitly marked relations", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "5.2 Mapping RST annotations onto PDTB annotations for explicitly marked relations", "text": "Table 3 shows the same data as Table 2, but with the colors indicating the percentage of matches in relation to the expected PDTB class. We will only point out results here that were not obvious when looking at the table from the PDTB perspective. For RST's SEQUENCE class, we find that a substantial portion is commented on as a PDTB CONJUNCTION (36%), i.e. the annotations through the various frameworks do not match in these cases whether the relationship is temporal or not. The RST relationship KIRKUMSTANZ is a common label in RST, but it does not have a directly corresponding label in PDTB. A large variety of PDTB labels has been assigned to RST-KIRKUMSTANZ relationships. While most cases of KIRKSTANZ-KRIST-KRIST-KRIST relationships are limited in time, we find them as RIST."}, {"heading": "5.3 Analysis of annotation for ambiguous connectives", "text": "Given the discrepancies, which sometimes also relate to different interpretations of specific ambiguous connectors, as discussed in Section 5.1, we examined the agreement on the note of ambiguous connectors in detail. Finally, it is not surprising to achieve a high degree of agreement between the frameworks for labeling relationships with a unique connector, such as that referred to as CONDITIONAL; this could happen automatically. Rather, the value of the manual note is achieved by adding additional information through discambiguity between relationships if the marker is ambiguous (or if a relationship is not explicitly labeled, see Section 5.4 below). To this end, for each connectivity, we have tested whether comments from the two schemes match significantly more than one would expect that the relationship between people is ambiguous (or if a relationship is not explicitly labeled, see Section 5.4 below)."}, {"heading": "5.4 Mapping PDTB annotations onto RST annotations for implicit relations", "text": "A first striking observation is that a substantial part of the instances consists of almost all PDTB classes."}, {"heading": "5.5 Mapping RST annotations onto PDTB annotations for implicit relations", "text": "Table 5 shows the alignment of implicit relationships from the perspective of the RST. Many cells are colored green, indicating that the annotations for many of the RST relationships have a wide variety of PDTB labels. For RST's BACKGROUND, CIRCUMSTANCE, and COMMENT relationships in particular, the PDTB labels are distributed almost evenly among the most important classes of relationships, suggesting that these RST labels classify relationships according to communicative functions that are not represented in the PDTB annotation Scheme. RST's Causal Relations CONSEQUENCE, REASONS 5, and RESULT6 cards are relatively well associated with the causal relationships of the PDTB. However, other causal RST labels (EVIDENCE and EXPLANATION ARGUMENTATIVES) are often associated with the additive PDTB labels."}, {"heading": "6.
