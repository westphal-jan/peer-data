The support vector machines generate the forecasts and the random forest acts as an ensemble learning method to combine the forecasts. The common ensemble technique in wind and solar power forecasting is the blending of meteorological data from several sources. In this study though, the present and the past solar power forecasts from several models, as well as the associated meteorological data, are incorporated into the random forest to combine and improve the accuracy of the day-ahead solar power forecasts. The performance of the combined model is evaluated over the entire year and compared with other combining techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 04:27:00 GMT  (1003kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00033v1", "This is a preprint of the full paper that published in Innovative Smart Grid Technologies, North America Conference, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "This is a preprint of the full paper that published in Innovative Smart Grid Technologies, North America Conference, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["mohamed abuella", "badrul chowdhury"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00033"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.00033.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Random Forest Ensemble of Support Vector Regression Models for Solar Power Forecasting", "authors": ["Mohamed Abuella"], "emails": ["mabuella@uncc.edu", "b.chowdhury@uncc.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "A. Random Forest", "text": "To make the trees more variable and uncorrelated, Breiman [17] suggested that each splitting of the felled tree should be determined by a random number of features and observation samples. Therefore, this method is called a random forest (RF), which is randomly selected for each splitting.
