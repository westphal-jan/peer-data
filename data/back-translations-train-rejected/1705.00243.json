Instead the mechanism designer receives a set of samples from this distribution and his goal is to use the sample to design a pricing mechanism or auction with high expected profit. We provide generalization guarantees which bound the difference between average profit on the sample and expected profit over the distribution. These bounds are directly proportional to the intrinsic complexity of the mechanism class the designer is optimizing over. We present a single, overarching theorem that uses empirical Rademacher complexity to measure the intrinsic complexity of a variety of widely-studied single- and multi-item auction classes, including affine maximizer auctions, mixed-bundling auctions, and second-price item auctions. Despite the extensive applicability of our main theorem, we match and improve over the best-known generalization guarantees for many auction classes. This all-encompassing theorem also applies to multi- and single-item pricing mechanisms in both multi- and single-unit settings, such as linear and non-linear pricing mechanisms. Finally, our central theorem allows us to easily derive generalization guarantees for every class in several finely grained hierarchies of auction and pricing mechanism classes. We demonstrate how to determine the precise level in a hierarchy with the optimal tradeoff between profit and generalization using structural profit maximization.

The winning function depends primarily on the allocation to each of the buyers. In the case of price mechanisms, the profit is fully determined once these allocations are determined. (In the meantime, the auction classes that we are investigating are variants of the classic VCG mechanism, so the profit also depends on the n + 1 allocations that would be made without the participation of each buyer in the round. Once all of these n + 1 allocations are set, the payment function is simple - it is a linear function of the auction parameters and the buyer ratings for each of the n + 1 allocations.
