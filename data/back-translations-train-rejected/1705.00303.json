By introducing two new types of equivalence relations between arguments, i.e. defense equivalence and root equivalence, we have shown that defense equivalence can be used to grasp the equivalence of argument graphs from the perspective of reasons for the acceptance of arguments. Furthermore, we have defined a concept of summarizing argument graphs by exploiting root equivalence. Under complete semantics, defense equivalence is between strong and standard equivalence. It is interesting to further examine their position in the so-called argumentation zoo, where other equivalence concepts between the two extreme versions are also compared [13], and to investigate how defense equivalence, root equivalence, and strong equivalence relate to each other."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The research reported in this article was partially supported by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) in the framework of the funding INTER / MOBILITY / 14 / 8813732 for the project FMUAT: Formal Models for Uncertain Argumentation from Text and by the research and innovation programme Horizon 2020 of the European Union under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie funding agreement No. 690974 for the project MIREL: MIning and REasoning withLegal texts."}], "references": [{"title": "Characteristics of multiple viewpoints in abstract argumentation", "author": ["P.E.
