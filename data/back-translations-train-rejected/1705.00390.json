Connections known to WordNet will be identified in the WordNet gloss, but not in the way it turns out in the OtherDict gloss. This has most likely reduced the number of overlaps we have found, since a WordNet connection such as a light year will not coincide with a light year, which is the form used in OtherDict.In the following sections, we will describe the Duluth systems. Since the only distinction between them is how they reconstruct WordNet gloss, we will provide a running example to illustrate each system. We will use the cat # n # 1 noun for this purpose. The original WordNet entry for these glosses (before these are predators) indicates that they are # predators."}, {"heading": "2.1 Duluth2", "text": "Duluth2 is the most basic of the Duluth systems. Each WordNet sense is represented by its sheen, in which all the stopwords and single-letter words have been removed. The stoplist comes from the Ngram Statistics Package (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003a) and includes 392 words. To continue our example, the first noun sense of cats is represented by Duluth2, as shown below - it was simply pre-processed and then stopwords removed. \u2022 Cat # 1: supple, round-headed and retractable in fissipedal mammals This system provides a baseline for the overlap measure as we compare the original Wordnet and OtherDict gloss after minimal pre-processing."}, {"heading": "2.2 Duluth1", "text": "Duluth1 is a natural extension of Duluth2, where each WordNet gloss is extended by concatenating with it (in the following order): the gloss of the hypernyms of sense3, the gloss of all hyponyms of sense, the gloss of each derived form of sense, and the gloss of all meronyms of sense. This greatly increases the size of each WordNet gloss, to the point where our original attempts to use these extended gloss simply in accordance took too much time to finish during the available time window for evaluation.

Stopwords are removed by using the same list as Duluth2.We can see in our running example that this offers a greater sheen, but is not as big as Duluth1 (before trimming it down to the first nine words). \u2022 Cat mammal # 1: supple, rounded, columnar mammals with retractable claws that eat terrestrial flesh, four five-headed cats with thick fur, which are usually feral cats."}, {"heading": "2.4 Duluth3", "text": "There are many minor variations between words in WordNet and OtherDict glosses, and it is difficult to normalize the glosses to eliminate them. Instead, we opted for a system based on character trigrams, since it could allow matches between parts of words, rather than requiring the exact matches that all other Duluth systems insist on. Duluth3 expands each WordNet gloss with the gloss of its hypernyms and hyponyms (such as Duluth4, although stop words are not eliminated in Duluth3), then all spaces are removed from each extended gloss and it is broken into three character grams. Glosses were limited to 250 of these trigrams, mainly so that they can be executed within the available time during evaluation. If you study the running example carefully, you can reconstruct the gloss that is similar to Duluth4, except that it contains stops."}, {"heading": "3 Results and Discussion", "text": "Despite seemingly significant differences in the way WordNet glosses were extended, Table 1 shows that there were only minor differences in results between Duluth1, Duluth2, and Duluth3, which seems to support the conclusion that glossy overlaps provide a reliable and robust starting point for this problem."}, {"heading": "1 195,242 0.3033 0.0050 0.4654", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5 973,463 0.3336 0.0183 0.5003", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "9 1,701,884 0.3312 0.0233 0.4976", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "10 1,866,198 0.3278 0.0200 0.4937", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "20 3,023,538 0.3296 0.0200 0.4958", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "30 3,575,586 0.3476 0.0300 0.5159", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "40 3,871,786 0.3471 0.0383 0.5153", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "50 4,059,495 0.3444 0.0400 0.5123", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "100 4,466,581 0.3511 0.0400 0.5197", "text": "Recall that Duluth4 is an obvious extension of Duluth2, broadening the glosses with its hypernym and hyponyms, resulting in a modest but significant improvement in the systems submitted for formal evaluation, suggesting that focusing on the extended glosses content can pay off in a relatively straightforward way.
