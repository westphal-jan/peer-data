We will show how to categorize the different pieces of evidence. We will present the reasoning rules that were extracted from a simple cyber attack and converted into arguments. Finally, we will show the use of arguments and priority rules to solve the mapping problem. The tactical level includes technical information obtained by verifying the system, and the attack code: IP addresses from which the attack came, domain names, the original language of the programmers who wrote the code, the target in the system. The operational level includes less technical evidence, such as entity or group claiming the attack, the context (e.g. political or geographical) of the attack, the ability / capabilities required to carry out the attack."}, {"heading": "Further Reasoning Rules and Priorities", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before we reach an agreement."}, {"heading": "The Problem of Data Sharing", "text": "There is a need not only to protect the data, but also to lead to a correct and effective distribution of data, respecting the requirements of the end user, while the data is shared or processed. Ability to respect the above rules and requirements is not trivial, since they are related to different laws and domains. They can create conflicts between the individual laws, for example by sharing the rules of data exchange with the doctor who distributes or processes the data."}, {"heading": "An Example of Decision Process for E-Health", "text": "The resolution of conflicts takes place by the introduction of priority rules and the indication of the context in which one argument is stronger than another. GorgiasB examines the arguments and priority rules, when a conflict is detected, other priority rules are introduced. Data can be derived from three types of emergencies: (i) Presc (data), Presc (data), Presc (drugs), X-rays (data), which is the owner of the data, and the relationship with the patients (data) The data can be of three types: Presc (data), Presc (data), prescriptions, X-rays (data), the private prescriptions: PData (data), e.g. antidepressant treatments (data), iiiiiii) personal information: PInfo (data), address, address, address, family contacts (data)."}, {"heading": "Future Work and Conclusion", "text": "There are several challenges that need to be taken into account in our approach, so that we have a basis for addressing security and privacy issues in the new connected world.
