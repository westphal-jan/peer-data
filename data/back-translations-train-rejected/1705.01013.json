Introduction", "text": "Data fusion has been extensively studied in recent decades, especially its military applications. Multi-sensor data fusion (MSDF) technology is playing an increasingly important role in combat demand. How to merge sensor data is still an open question [1-4]. Due to its strong ability to handle uncertain information, DS evidence theory is widely used in MSDF [5-8]. However, dealing with conflicts is crucial in the complex practical situation. The information provided by a sensor report is likely to be disturbed and false. In this case, there may be a strong conflict between the evidence and lead to a false fusion result. Dealing with conflicts is crucial for data fusion [9-12]. To resolve it, many approaches have been proposed [13-15]. In order to deal with conflicting information, most previous methods deal with evidence based on the relationship between the data collected by sensors, leading to a false fusion result [13-15]. However, this letter suggests that a quantum result itself is a method [19]."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "The Dempster-Shafer evidence theory was proposed by Dempster in 1967 [24] and modified by Shafer in 1978. In evidence theory, the basic theorem, known as the distributional framework, consists of a set of N that are mutually exclusive and contain exhaustive hypotheses symbolized by \u0432 = {X1, X2,.., XN}. Allow P, the power theorem composed of 2N elements, to... Basic probability Assignment (BPA) is an assignment of P (\u0432) to [0, 1], {X2},., defined by: m: P (m2) \u2192 [0, 1] (BOster) (1) that meets the following conditions:."}, {"heading": "3. Quantum mechanical modelling of the sensor reliability in data", "text": "In order to achieve a more reasonable fusion, we propose a method based on quantum mechanics to determine the confidence coefficient curve of radar sensor reports. We assume that the reliability of sensor reports refers to the distance between object and sensor in some degrees. The signal of the object is received by radars. Transmission power of the object is Pt, the antenna gain of the object is Gt, the antenna gain of the reconnaissance radar is Gr, the distance between object and radar is called x. The signal strength of the radar is: Pr = PtGtG.2 (6), where the antenna gain of the reconnaissance radar is Gr, the distance between object and radar is called x."}, {"heading": "4. Numerical example", "text": "In this section, a numerical example is illustrated to show the effectiveness of our method. In a target detection system, five radar sensors have collected five BOEs, which are represented as follows: (R1, m1) = ([{A}, 0.6], [{B}, 0.15], [{A, C}, 0.25] (R2, m2) = ({{A}, 0.5], [{B}, 0.3], [{C}, 0.2]) (R3, m3) = ([{B}, 0.95], [{C}, 0.05]) (R4, m4) = ({{A}, 0.55], [{B}, 0.25], [{A, C}, 0.2]) (R5, m5) = ([{A}, 0.6], [{B}, 0.3], [B, C}, 0.1]). The reliability of these sensor reports is based on 0.55, the results of 0.6 to the 0.6, the results of the 0.6, the 0.6, and the confidence of the 0.6."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In summary, we propose a new method for modelling the reliability of sensor reports. In contrast to previous methods, we focus on the characteristics of a sensor itself. A radar sensor's confidence coefficient curve is determined by solving a quasi-time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is applied when combining evidence, and the result demonstrates the efficiency of our method."}, {"heading": "6.
