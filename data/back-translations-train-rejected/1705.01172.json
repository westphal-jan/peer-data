In this paper, we propose a new framework for probabilistic belief change based on imaging, called Expected Distance Imaging (EDI). EDI is sufficiently general to define Bayesian conditioning and other forms of imaging previously defined in the literature. We argue that, and investigate how, EDI can be used for both revision and update. EDI's definition depends crucially on a weight function whose properties are studied and whose effect on belief change operations is analysed. Finally, four EDI instantiations are proposed, two for revision and two for update, and probabilistic rationality postulates are suggested for their analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 May 2017 20:50:59 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01172v1", "21 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gavin rens", "thomas meyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01172"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.01172.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Imagining Probabilistic Belief Change as Imaging (Technical Report)", "authors": ["Gavin Rens"], "emails": ["grens@cs.uct.ac.za", "tmeyer@cs.uct.ac.za"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is a real process in which it is a matter of changing the world, changing the world, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, widening it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it, changing it."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "We will work with a finite classical propositional logic (\u03b2) = finite amount of n atoms.

We have worked with the hypothesis that retention refers to revision and that relaxation refers to actualization, but to what extent is this hypothesis true? What is the significance of the effect of the magnitude of AvRcp and Expendfr? We would like to conduct a deeper study of probabilistic rationality, especially that of actualization (since it has not received much attention in the literature)."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change: Partial meet contraction and revision functions", "author": ["C.
