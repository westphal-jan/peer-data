He stressed how important they were not only for politics but also for educational purposes. Among other conversation norms, he claims that people should be able to talk about what they should talk about depending on the topic of the conversation, and that they should not talk about themselves. Norms like these can become social conventions and are not learned at home or in school. Social conventions are dynamic and can change according to context, culture and language. In online communication, new common sense practices are developed more quickly and accepted as norms. [2], there is no discipline for them in elementary or high schools and there are few linguistic researchers conducting research on the subject. On the other hand, in the field of artificial intelligence, some conversational systems have been created over the past decades."}, {"heading": "2 Challenges on Chattering", "text": "There are a number of reasons why we are not in a position to pursue such a policy, in the way we have practised it in the past, in the way we have practised it today: in the way we have changed the world, in the way we have changed the world, in the way we have changed it, in the way we have changed it, in the way we have changed it, in the way we have changed it, in the way we have changed it, in the way we have changed it, in the way we have changed it."}, {"heading": "3 Conversational Systems", "text": "In this section we discuss the state of the art in conversation systems in three perspectives: types of interactions, types of architecture and types of contextual logic. Then we present a table that consolidates and compares all of them. ELIZA [12] was one of the first software that was created to understand the processing of natural language. Joseph Weizenbaum created it in 1966 at MIT and it is known to act like a psychotherapist, and it only had to reflect the statements of the patient. ELIZA was created to address five \"fundamental technical problems\": the identification of critical words, the discovery of a minimal context, the choice of suitable transformations, the generation of appropriate responses to the transformation or absence of critical words, and the provision of an end capacity for ELIZA scripts. Directly after ELIZA came PARRY, developed by Kenneth Colby, a psychiatrist at Stanford University who worked as a psychiatrist in the early 1970s."}, {"heading": "3.1 Types of Interactions", "text": "This year, it will only be a matter of time before the country moves into the EU, until it moves back into the EU."}, {"heading": "3.2 Types of Architectures", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they have set themselves, and they are able to play by the rules that they have set by the rules."}, {"heading": "3.3 Types of Intentions", "text": "In a goal-oriented system, the main goal is to interact with the user, so that back-end tasks that are application-specific are performed by a supporting system. As an example of application, we can cite technical support systems, for example, airline ticket reservation systems, where the calling system must interact with the user until all the required information is known, such as origin, destination, departure date and return date, and the supporting system must book the ticket. The most common approaches to developing these systems are partially observed decision processes (POMDP) [31], hidden markov models (HMM) [30] and more recently memory networks [29]. Given that these approaches are data-oriented, a major problem is to gather a large company of commented task-specific dialogues."}, {"heading": "3.4 Types of Context Reasoning", "text": "A dialog system that supports the context gumentation or not.

Platforms to plug in chatbots provide tools to integrate into another system, such as Slack7. Chatbots must receive and send messages in a certain way, which depends on the API, and there is no support for actual support in building chatbots with natural speech comprehension. Chatbots create platforms mainly offer tools to add and train intentions along with the specification of dialogue flow and extraction of some units, without support for reasoning. Once the models are trained and the dialogue flow specified, the chatbots are able to respond to the received intention. Platforms to create service chatbots offer the same functionality as the last one and also provide support in defining the current actions summarized in the table 8 of current chatbots, if they are executed in accordance with the categories."}, {"heading": "4 A Conceptual Architecture for Multiparty-Aware Chatbots", "text": "This section presents the conceptual architecture for creating a hybrid rule and a machine. MPCS is represented by the entities and relationships in Fig. 1, which represents the knowledge of the people. A chat group can accept the intention of the group, or someone invited by the owners, or assume a domain role as an expert."}, {"heading": "4.1 Workflow", "text": "Figure 2 shows that a statement is made in a chat group at the time when a response is generated in the same chat group when the case occurs. One or more people may be in the chat group, while one or more chatbots are also sent. There is a hub that is responsible for sending messages to every member of the group when the case occurs. The flow begins when a statement is sent to the chat group and, if allowed, is broadcast. Many or no interactions can be enforced at this level depending on the application. Here, a rule can be a prohibition, obligation or permission to send a statement to the chat group. Once the statement is broadcast, a chatbot must handle the statement. To handle it properly, the chatbot analyzes the statement with multiple parsers during the parsing phase."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Topic Classifier", "text": "However, the chatbot can respond better if the intention or action is not detected, which means that it does not know how to respond. In any case, it must be able to provide an appropriate response when needed. As this can happen throughout the workflow, the earlier information becomes available, the better the chatbot will respond. Therefore, it is one of the first versions of the flow."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Dependency Parsing", "text": "Dependence is the notion that linguistic units, such as words, are connected to each other by directed links. (Finite) verb is assumed to be the structural center of the sentence structure. All other syntactic units (words) are either directly or indirectly connected to the verb in relation to directed links, which are called dependencies. The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency programs are word (or morpho-) grammars. All that exists are the elements and dependencies that connect the elements into a structure. Dependency grammar (DG) is a class of modern syntactic theories, all based on the dependency relationship."}, {"heading": "4.1.3 Frame Parsing", "text": "In this module, the generated dependency tree is used along with a set of rules to extract information that is stored in context using the frame-based approach, which fills the slots of the frame with the values extracted from the dialog. Frames are like forms and slots like fields. Using the conceptual model of knowledge, the fields are represented by the elements entities and features. In the dependency tree example, the entity would be the implicit concept: the investment option, and the feature is the implicit concept: initial amount - 10,000. Since the goal is to invest, and more entities are needed to do so (i.e. fields to be filled), the next node in the Intention Flow tree would return an expression asking the user for the investment time if he / she has not provided it. This module could be implemented with different approaches depending on the domain, but will be tree searching algorithms to perform tree parsing."}, {"heading": "4.1.4 Intent Classifier", "text": "The Intent Classifier component aims to detect not only the intention, but also the goal of a member's statement so that it can respond appropriately; the development of an Intent Classifier must address the following steps: i) the creation of a Intent Data Set, as defined in i) to train the classification algorithm; ii) the design of a classification algorithm that provides an appropriate level of accuracy; iii) the creation of a data set of Intent Trees, as defined in i) and that maps the goals; iv) the design of a Plan Graph Search Algorithm that maps the state of the goal to a node in the diagram; there are several approaches to creating training sets for dialogues: from the incremental approach to crowdsourcing. In a step-by-step approach, the Wizard of Oz method can be applied to a number of potential users of the system, and from this study, a set of questions can be collected manually per class, which must be asked by the system to the first set of the \"Intent Classes.\""}, {"heading": "4.1.5 Speech Act Classifier", "text": "The Speech Act Classifier can be implemented with many language act classes depending on the needs of the application. The more classes, the more flexible the chatbot is. It can be built on the basis of dictionaries or trained as a machine learning classifier. In the following table, we present the most important and more general language act classes [44] used in the chatbots, with examples to distinguish them:"}, {"heading": "4.1.6 Action Classifier", "text": "There are at least as many action classes as speech act classes, because the action is the realization of a speech act. Domain-specific classes such as \"Inform _ News\" or \"Inform _ Factoids\" expand the possibilities of answering a chat message. The action classifier can be defined as a multi-class classifier, where Ia is the intention of the answer defined in (2), Sa is the speech act of the answer, E and F are the totality of units and attributes required to produce the answer if necessary."}, {"heading": "4.1.7 Action Execution", "text": "This component is responsible for implementing the behavior of the action class. Basic behaviors can exist and be shared among different chatbots, such as those who send the greetings, thanks to or not understood. Although they may be general, they can also be personalized to distinguish the bot from each other and also make it more \"real.\" Other cases want to inform, send a query, send a suggestion, they are all domain-dependent and may require specific implementations. In any case, Figure 3 at the highest level shows the generic workflow. If the action class is detected, the system will implement the execution of the task, such as to drive a car, move the arm of a robot, or calculate the return on investment. Execution may need to access an external service on the Internet to complete the task, such as the inflation rate or interest rates, or to obtain information about the environment, or an external factor."}, {"heading": "5 Architecture Implementation and Evaluation", "text": "This section presents an implementation of the conceptual architecture presented in the previous section. After many refactorings, a framework called SABIA (Speech-Act-Based Intelligent Agents Framework) was developed and the application CognIA (Cognitive Investment Advisor) was developed as an instance of the SABIA framework. Afterwards, we present the accuracy and some automated tests of this implementation."}, {"heading": "5.1 Speech-Act-based Intelligent Agents Framework", "text": "SABIA was developed based on the Akka intermediate10. Akka is a toolkit and runtime that implements the actor model on the JVM. Akka's features such as contemporaneity, distributed computing, resilience and message delivery were inspired by Erlangen's actor model [45]. The actor model is a mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats \"actors\" as universal primitives of concurrent computation. In response to a message it receives, an actor can: make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages and determine how he responds to the next message received. Actors can change the private state, 10http: / / akka.iobut can only influence each other through messages (to avoid the need for keys). Akka middleware manages the actors \"life cycle, and actors look for their name, locally or remotely."}, {"heading": "5.1.1 Dependency Parsing", "text": "This is implemented in SABIA as a singleton, which is initialized during SabiaActorSystem initialization with the URL of the service that implements dependency parsing and is used on the arrival of each utterance by executing the tagUtterance method.

Then the invariant parts that use SQL are already present and the application only needs to implement the database connection and follow the required data schema."}, {"heading": "5.1.5 Action Execution", "text": "SABIA provides partially implemented behavior for the action through the template method design pattern [47], which implements the invariant parts of the action execution and leaves placeholders for customization."}, {"heading": "5.2 CognIA: A Cognitive Investment Advisor", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to hide, and that we are able to hide, \"he said."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Instantiating SABIA to develop CognIA", "text": "We created SABIA to develop CognIA as follows: intermediaries, savings account, CDB and user actors are members of the chat group. The hub was implemented with two servers: Socket.io and Node.JS, a socket client of the Socket.io server. The CognIA system also has a socket client for receiving the transmission and forwarding it to the group chat manager. The former will actually perform the transmission to each member after having enforced the standards set out in Table 11. Each member will also behave according to this table. For each user of the chat group, on a mobile phone or desktop, there is its corresponding actor, which is represented by the user actor in the illustration. Its main task is to receive Akka's shipment and forward it to the Socket.io server so that it can finally be forwarded to the users."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Topic Classifier", "text": "We have created a small dictionary-based thematic classifier to determine whether or not a statement relates to financing and whether or not it relates to the two investment options (CDB or savings account)."}, {"heading": "5.2.3 Dependency Parsing", "text": "Dependence is extremely important for calculating the return on investment when the user sends a statement with that intention. Our first implementation used regular expressions, which led to a very fragile approach. Then, we used a TensorFlow implementation11 [48] of a SyntaxNet model for Portugal and used it to generate the dependency parse trees of the utterances. SyntaxNet model is a forward-looking neural network that operates on a task-specific transition system and tagged the state of the art on part-ofspeech, dependency analysis and sentence compression results [49]. Below, we present Output12 of the service for uttering: \"I want to invest 10 thousand in 40 months.\""}, {"heading": "5.2.4 Frame Parsing", "text": "Given the tree dependency, we implemented the frame parsing, which first extracts the entities and features from the utterance and then stores them in context.

So, if the chatbot is needed to calculate the return on investment, then once it is calculated, the speech act of the response will be Inform _ Calculation and the one that represents the query for it will be Query _ Calculation. In Table 12, we list the specific ones."}, {"heading": "5.2.6 Intention Classifier", "text": "Given the fact that there is no public record of financial intentions in Portuguese, we have used the incremental approach to create our own training set for the Intent Classifier. First, we applied the Wizard of the Oz Method and from this study we collected a series of 124 questions that users asked. Next, after these questions were manually classified into a series of intention classes, and used to train the first version of the system, this sentence was increased both in terms of the number of classes and samples per class, resulting in a training set of 37 intentions, and a total of 415 samples, with samples per class from 3 to 37. We have defined our classification method based on properties extracted from word vectors. Word vectors consist of a way to encode the semantic meaning of the words based on their frequency of common occurrence."}, {"heading": "5.2.7 Action Classifier", "text": "We manually mapped the intent classes that are used to train the intent classifier on action classes and the dependent entities and features if this is the case. Table 13 summarizes the number of intent classes per action class that we used in CognIA."}, {"heading": "5.2.8 Action Execution", "text": "For most of the action classes, we used the default behavior of SABIA. For example, Greet and Bye action classes are implemented by means of a report, which means that when the user says \"Hello,\" the chatbot responds \"Hello.\" The Search News, Compute and Ask More categories require a specific implementation of CognIA as follows: \u2022 Search News: search finance on social media service [50], [51] receives the utterance as input, searches for financial data for Portuguese on previously indexed Twitter data and returns to the one that has the highest score when found. 13We also evaluated word vectors created in Portuguese with all texts from Wikipedia, but after conducting some preliminary experiments, we found that the use of tweets and news articles yielded better results. We believe that this is due to (i) the more specific domain knowledge in the news articles and (ii) the more informal text bots that are sent to the language that tends to be used."}, {"heading": "5.3 Intention Classifier Accuracy", "text": "In Table 15 we present the comparison of some different classifications on the first version of the training set, i.e. on the scale used to integrate the first classifier into the system. Broadly speaking, the 1NN classifier was able to achieve a level of accuracy higher than other known classifiers, such as Logistic Regression and Na\u00efve Bayes, which shows that 1NN is suitable as a development classifier. Nevertheless, an SVM can perform considerably better than 1NN and achieve accuracies about 12 percentage points higher, showing that this type of basic classifier is a better choice when the system is stable enough. It is worth noting that these results take into account the one-sided validation process, as the number of samples in some classes is very low. As we have already mentioned, the use of a 1NN classifier has enabled the system developer to easily add new target classes and samples, so that the system could present a new class with a great understanding of 6N or very high accuracy actions."}, {"heading": "5.4 Testing SABIA", "text": "In this section, we describe the validation framework we have created for integration testing, which we have developed as a new component of the SABIA system architecture, and it provides a high-level language capable of defining interaction scenarios that simulate user interaction with the chatbots used; system testers deliver a set of statements and expected responses; and the framework automatically simulates user interaction with the bots and captures metrics such as response time and other resource consumption metrics (e.g. memory, CPU, network bandwidth); our goal was to (i) provide a tool for integration testing; (ii) validate the implementation of CognIA; and (ii) help system developers understand the behavior of the system and what aspects can be improved."}, {"heading": "5.4.1 Test framework", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "5.4.2 Test setup", "text": "CognIA was used on IBM Bluemix, a platform as a service, on a Liberty for Java Cloud Foundry app with 3GB of RAM and 1GB of hard disk. Each of the modules shown in Figure 4 is used on separate Bluemix servers. Node.JS and Socket.IO servers are both used as Node Cloud Foundry apps, each with 256MB of RAM memory and 512MB of hard disk. Search Finance on Social Media is based on a Go build pack Cloud Foundry app with 128MB of RAM memory and 128GB of hard disk. For the frame part that simulates clients, we have instantiated a virtual machine with 8cores on IBM's SoftLayer that can communicate with Bluemix. Subsequently, the system testers have constructed two dialogs, i.e. D = {d1, d2}. The example shown in Table 17 is the d1 dialog test. For the d2 dialog, although there are also 10 statements, the results of the other test will vary by an average of 1 to see if some of them are shown in the financial test results."}, {"heading": "5.4.3 Results", "text": "The first test consists of running both dialogs d1 and d2 for only one user for the complete verification of reason. We use 30 seconds as the maximum time that a simulated user should wait for a correct answer before making an error. The result is that all chatbots (Mediator, CDBExpert) react before the maximum time. Furthermore, the frame will show how long each chatbot takes to give an expected answer. In Figure 5 we show the results for the dialog d1, as for the dialog d2 the results are roughly the same. The X-axis (Response Identifier) corresponds to the second column (Resp. Id) in Figure 5, which we can see when the Bot responds with the message."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this article, we explored the challenges of MPCS engineering and presented a hybrid conceptual architecture and its implementation with a financial advisory system. We are currently developing this architecture to support the specification of decoupled interaction standards, and we are also developing a multi-party governance service that uses this specification to force the exchange of compliant statements. We are also exploring a micro-service implementation of SABIA to increase its scalability and performance so that thousands of members can join the system within thousands of conversations."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank Maximilien de Bayser, Ana Paula Appel, Flavio Figueiredo and Marisa Vasconcellos, who contributed to the discussions during the implementation of SABIA and CognIA."}], "references": [{"title": "No country for old members: User lifecycle and linguistic change in online communities", "author": ["C.
