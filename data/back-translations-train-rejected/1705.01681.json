The world fleet has experienced continuous growth with an annual increase of 4.1% in 2013, reaching a total of 1.69 billion dwt (working tonnage) in January 2014. Shipping companies are constantly striving to achieve economies of scale in order to reduce transport costs, which are strongly influenced by fuel costs. Therefore, the planning and planning of routes is critical.The ship planning problem, taking into account berth allocation, has been highlighted as a promising area of research both operationally and economically.? The corresponding author Tel.: + 52-181-22536444ar Xiv: 170 5.01 681v 1 [cs.A] 2 These problems have practical implications in particular for shipping companies that have no control over the allocation of berths to public ports."}, {"heading": "2 Related works", "text": "This work is related to two known problems, the Ship Scheduling Problem and the Berth Assignment Problem (BAP). The integration of these two intertwined problems has recently been identified as a promising area of research in both operational and economic terms [1, 2]. In this regard, the work in [9] proposes an integrated model for ship planning and berth allocation, motivated by the case of shipping lines with their own terminals. In a follow-up paper [10], the authors include transhipment. Both work represent a case study of a feeder service company operating in the Pearl River Delta region. A discreet arrangement of each port terminal with time restrictions is considered, but a ship cannot visit the same terminal more than once during the planning horizon. The problem dealt with in this work concerns the transport of palletized perishable cargo (fruits) during the fruit season."}, {"heading": "3 Problem definition", "text": "Consider a number of contracts C with due date, destination and cargo to be fulfilled by the shipping company. There are a number of port terminals for the loading of cargo on ships. Each port terminal has a number of berths with different draught capacities, which limit the amount of cargo that can be loaded on ships. In addition, berths have a variety of time windows in which ships can be moored. One consideration of the problem is that the cargo in a ship cannot be fully loaded if it is not profitable. If a cargo is not fully loaded, compensation will be paid to its customer. Also, the design of the ship should be evaluated when setting the timetable. The design of a ship corresponds to the maximum displacement at full load. Ship displacement occurs when there is a change in the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of the hull when the pallets are loaded on the ship."}, {"heading": "4 Network flow representation", "text": "The cargoes are divided into pallets, which are displayed as variable flows going through a directional diagram G = (N, A). Nodes i, N contain the origin of the ship, the time windows for berths in which pallets can be loaded into the ships, and the ship's destinations according to the preallocated cargoes; while the links (i, j) \"A model of possible sailing\" are shown in Fig. 1. In this example, the ships begin their routes at the blue nodes representing the origin of the ship and drive to some yellow nodes, which replicate the available time windows of the berths, in which pallets from the cargoes C1 and C2 can be loaded into ships V1 and V2 respectively. Ships can use the same berths twice from the same time windows (also in green ones, if necessary)."}, {"heading": "5 Model formulation", "text": "This section presents the mathematical formulation of the optimisation model for the tramp ship.

All decision variables and limitations of the process are indexed by the number of ships. In addition, restrictions (9) - (10) are made on scheduling linkages between ships and ships, while the schedules of ships cannot be determined separately from each other. Therefore, a heuristic decomposition method has been developed to efficiently resolve instances involving multiple ships. As shown in Fig. 2, the method is divided into two phases. Phase 1 quickly determines an initial schedule for each ship, whereas Phase 2 attempts to improve / verify these schedules while not spending too much time. The algorithm for the first phase is described in Table 1 and works as follows. First, restrictions (9) - (10) are dropped from the model, and preliminary schedules for each ship are calculated separately."}, {"heading": "7 Results", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions and Further Research", "text": "This work leads to an optimization of the model, which deals with the problem of trampolines and takes into account the availability of berths. It is formulated as a mixed-holistic linear problem and performs the assignment of berth windows to ships in which cargo is loaded, the routes of ships with the possibility of docking several times at the same or other berth, and the coordination of ships operating at the same time at one berth. Furthermore, the model takes into account the limitations of berths in terms of water depth or draught capacity. These limitations have not previously been addressed by the problem of berth allocation to the trampolar scheme. The proposed approach provides a decision support tool for the trampolar shipping company. The current planning activities are carried out manually by operational planners who deal with several difficulties in finding a feasible plan."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) through the SEP-CONACYTCB-2014-01240814 research grant (third author) and by the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies of the Pontificia Universidad Cato'lica de Valpara \u0301 \u0131so as part of the research project 037.499 / 2015 (second author).
