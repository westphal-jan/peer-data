Enhancement of the fingerprint ridge pattern is thus an essential pre-processing step that noticeably reduces false positive and negative detection rates. A particularly challenging setting is when the fingerprint images are corrupted or partially missing. In this work, we apply generative convolutional networks to denoise visible minutiae and predict the missing parts of the ridge pattern. The proposed enhancement approach is tested as a pre-processing step in combination with several standard feature extraction methods such as MINDTCT, followed by biometric comparison using MCC and BOZORTH3. We evaluate our method on several publicly available latent fingerprint datasets captured using different sensors.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 May 2017 05:29:23 GMT  (3150kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01707v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["jan svoboda", "federico monti", "michael m bronstein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01707"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.01707.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Generative Convolutional Networks for Latent Fingerprint Reconstruction", "authors": ["Jan Svoboda", "Federico Monti", "Michael M.

Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do and what they want to do."}, {"heading": "2. Related work", "text": "Various solutions to improve latent fingerprint matching systems have been explored in the past. However, many papers have improved latent fingerprint matching by using advanced features that require manual annotation [16, 33]. However, performing annotations in inferior latent fingerprints can be very time-consuming and even unfeasible in some settings. Other papers have sought to reduce the amount of manual entries to only selected latent interest areas (ROI) and singular dots [33, 34]. Approaches that merge multiple matchers or multiple latent fingerprints have been investigated in [30]. Another direction of improving fingerprint matching concerns improving acquired latent fingerprint images. Yoon et al. [33] proposed a semi-automatic method to improve comb information based on the estimated orientation picture. A more robust orientation field estimation technique based on short-time transform AC and RAN34 has been proposed in [SAN34]."}, {"heading": "3. Gradient-based fingerprint similarity", "text": "Since our method is based on Convolutionary Neural Networks (CNN), gradient analysis of the fingerprint image (SSE = 11) is already a natural choice, since the calculation of the image gradient can be implemented using the Convolutionary Operator. Gradient filter. We calculate the directional derivatives of the fingerprint image I by tangling it with the directional fingerprint image (I). (I) = I? Target image and reconstructed image Ir), using the direction in which we want to calculate the gradient (we use 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees). As a criterion for the similarity of two fingerprint images (target image and reconstructed image Ir), we use the average Mean Squared Error (MSE) in all directions, degree (Es, Ir) = the similarity of two fingerprint images (Es \u2212 Ir)."}, {"heading": "4. Fingerprint reconstruction model", "text": "Following the principles described in the previous sections and the guidelines presented in [29], we approached the fingerprint reconstruction problem using a fully revolutionary authencoder network.Architecture. The encoding part corresponds to a fully revolutionary neural network comprising five revolutionary layers. It receives as input tensors of the dimensions 1 @ 260x320 and produces as output tensors of the dimensions 1024 @ 8x10 (F @ WxH is a compact notation for tensors with width W, height H and F different functional channels).The revolutionary layers have an increment of equal to 2 and are equipped with reactivated Linear Unit (RELU).The batch normalization is applied to each layer for faster convergence [15].The output of the encoder is directly fed as input to the decoding part and is not replaced by the decoder, the following architecture decodes."}, {"heading": "5.

Conclusion", "text": "Inspired by previous applications, we have explored the possibility of using the Convolutionary Autoencoders to reconstruct latent or damaged fingerprints. In terms of the principles of some of the fingerprint trait extraction and matching algorithms, we have carefully designed an objective function that should both reflect the important fingerprint characteristics well and be efficiently optimized because it is based on the gradient analysis that has already been implemented on the GPUs. Our method is based on learning, but compared to some previous research results, we do not need real training data and effectively train our model on well-designed synthetic data sets, which gives us the advantage of not setting any size restrictions for training. We get state-of-the-art results on several challenging tasks, such as latent-latent-latent-fingerprint matching and latent-to-sensor database matching on standard IIT data sets that we do not directly evaluate based on existing data sets."}, {"heading": "7.
