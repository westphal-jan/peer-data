In order to quantify the quality of approximation, it is natural to consider the candidates and voters as embedded within a common metric space, and to ask how much further the chosen candidate is from the population as compared to the socially optimal one. We use this metric preference model to explore a fundamental and timely question: does the social welfare of a population improve when candidates are representative of the population? If so, then by how much, and how does the answer depend on the complexity of the metric space?", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 May 2017 08:30:46 GMT  (33kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01736v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 26 Aug 2017 09:23:41 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01736v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["yu cheng", "shaddin dughmi", "david kempe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01736"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.01736.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Yu Cheng", "Shaddin Dughmi", "David Kempe"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 5.01 736v 2 [cs.G T] Aug 26 2We limit attention to the most basic and common social electoral situation: a population of voters, two candidates and a majority election. If the candidates are not representative of the population, it is known that the candidate selected by the majority rule may be three times as far from the population as the socially optimal one, even if the underlying measure is a line. We study how this ratio improves when the candidates are drawn independently of the population of the voters. Our results are twofold: if the measurement is a line, the ratio improves from 3 to (4 \u2212 2 \u221a 2) \u2248 1.1716; this limit is narrow. If the measurement is arbitrary, we show a lower limit of 1.5 and a constant upper limit strictly better than 2 over the distortion of the majority rule.

This example is derived from Example 1 by shifting a suitable proportion of voters from place x2 \u2212 1 \u2212 to place x3 \u2212 1 \u2212 1, carefully weighing between two factors: (1) decrease in the paired distortion between candidates at \u2212 1 and 1 \u00b0 1, but (2) increase in the probability of such an election from place x2 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 = 1 point, because the voters are closer to a point x2 = 1 point at x1 = 1 point."}, {"heading": "3.1 Characterizing the Structure of Voting on the Line", "text": "Considering a distribution on the line with the support size n, we label the support points as 1,.., n from left to right.

We start with an example on the line (a variant of Example 1) that specifies the lower limit of 2. The distribution of candidates p has probability 1 / 2 at position \u2212 1, and the other 1 / 2 at position 1. The distribution of voters q has a (1 / 2 \u2212) share of voters at position \u2212 1, while the remaining voters are exactly to the right of the center at position 1 / 2.

The key to the uppermost part of this theorem is the following dilemma 13. This evidence is based on the following structural characterization: If a candidate pair exhibits distortions (exactly) 3 \u2212 3 candidates, then C (D, p) \u2264 2 candidates, \u2264 2 candidates. We prove Lemma 13 in section 5.2 that the evidence is based on the following structural characterization: If a candidate pair exhibits distortions for sufficiently small candidates, then the instance must be very structured: almost half of the probability mass must focus on the socially optimal candidate, and most of the remaining candidates must be nearly distant."}, {"heading": "5.1 Proof of Lemma 14", "text": "Let's assume that y = w (x, y) and x = o (x, y).

Then we can look at x, x is socially optimal, and all other places are at x and y.Let Y be the number of voters who prefer x, and X = Y the number of voters who prefer x over y. Then we can look at x, Y + pXdy, X + dy, y the number of voters, x."}, {"heading": "5.2 Proof of Lemma 13", "text": "The proof for Lemma 13 follows the same roadmap as the proof for Lemma 14, except that we no longer have a point with the probability mass 1 / 2. Instead, almost half the probability mass in a ball B with a small radius will lie around x. The three key properties used to bind \"i, j\" are then replaced by approximate (slightly inferior) versions. (5) Inequality (4) is simply due to the triangle of inequality, while Inequality (5) also uses the fact that half of the voters are closer to i, and at most the remaining half to the cost. Let (x, y) be the election maximizing rx, y, having rx, y = 3.

In order to quantify the quality of approximation, it is natural to consider the candidates and voters as embedded within a common metric space, and to ask how much further the chosen candidate is from the population as compared to the socially optimal one. We use this metric preference model to explore a fundamental and timely question: does the social welfare of a population improve when candidates are representative of the population? If so, then by how much, and how does the answer depend on the complexity of the metric space? We restrict attention to the most fundamental and common social choice setting: a population of voters, two candidates, and a majority rule election. When candidates are not representative of the population, it is known that the candidate selected by the majority rule can be thrice as far from the population as the socially optimal one; this holds even when the underlying metric is a line. We examine how this ratio improves when candidates are drawn independently from the population of voters. Our results are two-fold: When the metric is a line, the ratio improves from 3 to (4 \u2212 2 \u221a 2) \u2248 1.1716; this bound is tight. When the metric is arbitrary, we show a lower bound of 1.5 and a constant upper bound strictly better than 2 on the distortion of majority rule. The aforementioned positive results depend in part on the assumption that the two candidates are independently and identically distributed. However, we show that i.i.d. candidates do not suffice for our upper bounds: if the population of candidates can be different from that of voters, an upper bound of 2 on the distortion is tight for both general metric spaces and the line. Thus, we show a constant gap between representative and non-representative candidates in both cases. The exact size of this gap in general metric spaces is a natural open question.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
