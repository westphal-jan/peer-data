Introduction", "text": "The function of the Akshara to Prosedeme (A2P) converter is similar to that of the Grapheme to Phoneme (G2P) converter. In addition, the converter also includes the details of syllable boundaries and prosodic names. Previous studies on Hindi focused mainly on the implementation of the G2P converter for the speech synthesis program [1, 2, 3]. These G2P converters are based on linear phonological rules proposed in English [4]. However, the syllable is known to be a better unit for Hindi speech synthesis as described in [5, 6]. The usefulness of the syllable as a basic linguistic unit in the context of the speech recognition system is explored in English [7]. Similar work for Hindi requires software for syllable formation."}, {"heading": "2. Theoretical Background", "text": "Metric phonology is based on a nonlinear arrangement of the components of a phrase [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. The nonlinear arrangement is realized in the form of a tree with nodes as components of a phrase. The components are syllable, foot, phonological word, phonological phonology and intonational phrase. The syllable is the lowest unit in the hierarchy dominated by foot, which in turn is dominated by a phonological word. Higher units such as phonological phonology and intonational phrase are not relevant in the current work. The syllable functions as the domain of segmental phonological rules. In nonlinear phonology, the rules are written on the basis of the interaction between syllables among higher components. A syllable has binding rhymes and optional coda. The syllables are also described by the moraic weighting in quantitatively sensitive languages, such as Hindi [foot] is used as a two-dimensional domain and a description of phonology."}, {"heading": "3. I-Level Syllabification", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "3.1. Syllable Labeling", "text": "Hindi is a quantitatively sensitive language. Therefore, syllables in Hindi are also described on the basis of an attribute called moraic weight [15, 18]. The stress assignment rules for English suggested by [21] indicate the moraic weight as the most influential parameter. Based on the moraic weight, the following rules for the syllable designation in Hindi.i. Each short vowel (such as @, u, i) and each coda consonant of a syllable is assigned a weight of one mora, while a long vowel (such as a:, u: i:) is assigned a weight of two moras.ii. Syllables with one, two and three moras are designated as weak (w), heavy (h) and super heavy (sh) syllables (sh)."}, {"heading": "4. Foot Formation", "text": "This article describes a new approach to foot education in Hindi. The approach is based on three assumptions, six rules and a convention as described below."}, {"heading": "4.1. Assumptions", "text": "The process of marking syllables is described in section 3. \u2022 The foot is usually a binary branch. A bimoraic foot and a degenerated foot projected onto a syllable are also permitted. \u2022 A superfoot is formed either between a syllable and a foot or between two feet."}, {"heading": "4.2. Rules", "text": "The six rules for foot formation are listed below. \u2022 Weak to Weak Affinity Rule (WWAR): Two adjacent weak syllables form a binary foot and form a bimoraic foot, as shown in Fig. 3. The foot < s > is the additional metric foot that never endures stress. \u2022 Heavy to severe affinity rule (HHAR): Two adjacent heavy syllables also form a binary foot. In this case, three-syllable words that most syllables have left as heavy are downgraded as weak, and bilingual words that most nodes have as heavy are downgraded as weak. The foot structure is shown in Fig. 6 \u2022 Super Heavy to Other Affinity Rule (SOAR): The superheavy syllables that are always projected as a foot, as shown in Fig. 7 below, represent different syllable formation."}, {"heading": "4.3. Convention", "text": "The rules are left-to-right (LR). These rules are called affinity hierarchy rules. The word affinity describes the interaction between different or similar syllable types. The word \"hierarchy\" is used because these rules apply in the order of their height. The top rule in the hierarchy applies first, etc. The decreasing order of these rules is: LAR > WAR > HWAR > WHAR > HHHAR > SOAR"}, {"heading": "5. Schwa Deletion and Prosodic Labeling", "text": "Swa-deletion is an optional phenomenon in Hindi. This means that swa can be deleted or maintained in the same environment, and the choice depends solely on the speaker and the context used. Swa-deletion phenomena in Hindi help speakers to pronounce a word quickly, i.e. the process of swa-deletion reduces the overall effort in terms of duration. It allows stress to be shifted from one syllable to another. The following rules describe the contexts in which swa is deleted. \u2022 @ \u2192 / [\u03c3w - \u03c3w] \u2211 / [\u03c3h - \u03c3w] \u0445 \u2022 @ \u0432\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0441knknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknknkn"}, {"heading": "6.

The software is based on two proposed finite state machines\u2014one for the syllabification and another for the syllable labeling. In addition to that, it also uses a set of nonlinear phonological rules proposed for foot formation in Hindi, which encompass solutions to schwa-deletion in simple, compound, derived and inflected words. The nonlinear phonological rules are based on metrical phonology with the provision of recursive foot structure. A software module is implemented in Python. The testing of the software for syllabification, syllable labeling, schwa deletion and prosodic labeling yield an accuracy of more than 99% on a lexicon of size 28664 words.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
