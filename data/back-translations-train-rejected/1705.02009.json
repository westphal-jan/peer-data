Information shared on Twitter by both affected population (e.g., requesting assistance, warning) and those outside the impact zone (e.g., providing assistance) would help first responders, decision makers, and the public to understand the situation first-hand. Effective use of such information requires timely selection and analysis of tweets that are relevant to a particular disaster. Even though abundant tweets are promising as a data source, it is challenging to automatically identify relevant messages since tweet are short and unstructured, resulting to unsatisfactory classification performance of conventional learning-based approaches. Thus, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm to identify relevant messages based on matching keywords and hashtags, and provide a comparison between matching-based and learning-based approaches. To evaluate the two approaches, we put them into a framework specifically proposed for analyzing disaster-related tweets. Analysis results on eleven datasets with various disaster types show that our technique provides relevant tweets of higher quality and more interpretable results of sentiment analysis tasks when compared to learning approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 May 2017 20:42:23 GMT  (1216kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02009v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["hien to", "sumeet agrawal", "seon ho kim", "cyrus shahabi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02009"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.02009.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On Identifying Disaster-Related Tweets: Matching-based or Learning-based?", "authors": ["Hien To", "Sumeet Agrawal", "Seon Ho Kim", "Cyrus Shahabi"], "emails": ["hto@usc.edu", "sumeetag@usc.edu", "seonkim@usc.edu", "shahabi@usc.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is not only important to spread the news about victims and damage, but also to provide relevant information to disaster-stricken populations and first responders who can benefit from such information. Twitter is one of the most popular means of communication during disasters. [9] In particular, geotagged tweets have been used to understand the situation in the affected areas, for example, the analysis of the speed and impact of an earthquake [31] as shown in the news about the 2014 earthquake. \"Six Critically Injured, 120 Treated In Napa Hospital Following 6.0 Earthquake\" messages are challenging because they are short (maximum 144 characters) and informal, especially in disasters when they contain relevant information."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identifies social media as an essential component of future disaster management [9]. Tweets sent during catastrophic events are known to contain information that contributes to situational awareness [34], and a recent study of social media analysis in disaster response can be found in [13]. Therefore, the analysis of social media data for disaster response has attracted great interest in the research community. Existing studies focus on extracting disaster-related information from socially generated content during natural disasters, from which usable information can be shared with disaster responders [15]. More recent studies build classifiers for earthquake-related tweets [6], categorizing tweets based on informative and non-informative tweets [28], [24], [36], [4] tweets by type."}, {"heading": "III. FRAMEWORK", "text": "We propose a five-step framework for processing and analyzing disaster-related tweets, as shown in Figure 1. Note that in this study, we only consider geo-tagged tweets; for each disaster, spam tweets are removed (Step 1); after that, the cleaned geo-tagged tweets are mapped to affected and unaffected regions near each disaster (Step 2); for each region, tweets are categorized into relevant and irrelevant (Step 3), where relevant tweets are analyzed to determine the popularity of the feelings expressed by users during disasters (Step 4); and finally, spatial and temporal patterns and trends of mapped emotions are shown by visualization (Step 5); below, we describe each phase of the framework."}, {"heading": "A. Removing spam tweets and mapping tweets into affected and unaffected areas", "text": "Many tweets are generated by spammers or non-human bots. These tweets, if they are large enough, can distort the results of the analysis, so it is important to remove these spam tweets in the first step. We eliminate tweets from a user who generates more than a certain number of tweets (in this study, 15 tweets per day). Note that we do not remove retweets because we are interested in the actions of reposting or forwarding existing tweets. In the second step, we categorize tweets based on geographical regions affected by a disaster and outside the scope of impact. We are specifically interested in messages from the affected population, as they usually require more and timely help."}, {"heading": "C. Analyzing sentiment of relevant tweets", "text": "In this section, we present sentiment analysis as a specific application of the disaster-related tweets identified in the previous phase (see section III-B.) We use this application to compare the results of the two approaches to identifying relevant tweets. In order to identify the mood of individual tweets, we use a popular word embedding technique called doc2vec, which has been proven to achieve state-of-the-art results for sentiment analysis tasks [18]. In [18], each document (or tweet in this case) is represented by a fixed-length vector. We use an implementation of the doc2vec algorithm provided by the Gensim library.3) We feed three types of data into the doc2vec model: 1) a publicly available set of 1.6 million tweets (sentiment1404) with an equal number of positive and negative tweets for training, 2) a small set of scripted tweets for testing purposes, and 3) our predictive tweets."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Experimental Setup", "text": "We used a publicly available dataset in [29], consisting of IDs of geotagged tweets within the United States over two periods: June through November 2014 and 2015. From the Tweet IDs, we created eleven datasets using the Twitter Streaming API, each corresponding to a specific disaster officially declared by FEMA during the periods. In our experiments, we included three specific types of disasters: floods, earthquakes, and wildfires. Floods are the most common type of disaster in our datasets, and also the most common natural hazard in the world. A summary of these datasets is included in Table III, including various statistics such as the number of counties near the disasters and the number of counties affected. This data can be obtained from the FEMA website, from which we calculated the total number of geotagged tweets in the area and the number of those in the affected area. By default, we used the disaster-related tweets in the affected counties to evaluate."}, {"heading": "B. Experimental Results", "text": "1) Comparison of retrieved tweets and learning approaches in determining relevant tweets: We calculate the number of disaster-related tweets selected using the classifiers described in Section III-B. The results are shown in Table IV. We observe that the number of tweets found by the learning-based classifier is much higher than the number of tweets obtained by the matching-based classifier. This could be due to two reasons: the learning method can include many irrelevant tweets and the matching technique would overlook many relevant tweets. To work out this problem, as shown in [20], we assume that the number of agreed tweets by both classifiers is more accurate than the results from a single classifier and can therefore be considered a fundamental truth. Given this assumption, the percentage of relevant tweets that are recovered (precision score) 1. As a further measure of each tweet, we always calculate the individual reminder."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS", "text": "We have proposed two different techniques for identifying tweets that are relevant to a particular type of disaster. We have observed that the matching-based technique contains less relevant tweets but is higher quality compared to the learning-based approach. We have confirmed our findings by conducting various expertise on three types of disasters (earthquakes, floods, wildfires). As future work, we aim to further evaluate the trade-offs between the two techniques by ascertaining the basic truth of the data sets through crowdsourcing using Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will also expand our framework to include man-made disasters such as terrorism. Another challenging issue we need to address is the classification of disaster-related tweets in real time for timely analysis of the data. Finally, we aim to use the proposed framework for creating mood maps of the affected areas for real-time situational awareness during disasters. This is a step toward reclassifying information, often overlooked in existing situations and using it in sensitive studies."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "This research was funded by NSF grants IIS-1320149, CNS-1461963 and the USC Integrated Media Systems Center.

contributing to situational awareness during disasters. Information shared on Twitter by both affected population (e.g., requesting assistance, warning) and those outside the impact zone (e.g., providing assistance) would help first responders, decision makers, and the public to understand the situation first-hand. Effective use of such information requires timely selection and analysis of tweets that are relevant to a particular disaster. Even though abundant tweets are promising as a data source, it is challenging to automatically identify relevant messages since tweet are short and unstructured, resulting to unsatisfactory classification performance of conventional learning-based approaches. Thus, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm to identify relevant messages based on matching keywords and hashtags, and provide a comparison between matching-based and learning-based approaches. To evaluate the two approaches, we put them into a framework specifically proposed for analyzing disaster-related tweets. Analysis results on eleven datasets with various disaster types show that our technique provides relevant tweets of higher quality and more interpretable results of sentiment analysis tasks when compared to learning approach.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
