Recently, ideas have begun to emerge related to the analysis of time-varying graph signals. This work aims to elevate the notion of joint harmonic analysis to a full-fledged framework denoted as Time-Vertex Signal Processing, that links together the time-domain signal processing techniques with the new tools of graph signal processing. This entails three main contributions: (a) We provide a formal motivation for harmonic time-vertex analysis as an analysis tool for the state evolution of simple Partial Differential Equations on graphs. (b) We improve the accuracy of joint filtering operators by up-to two orders of magnitude. (c) Using our joint filters, we construct time-vertex dictionaries analyzing the different scales and the local time-frequency content of a signal. The utility of our tools is illustrated in numerous applications and datasets, such as dynamic mesh denoising and classification, still-video inpainting, and source localization in seismic events. Our results suggest that joint analysis of time-vertex signals can bring benefits to regression and learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 May 2017 17:20:32 GMT  (1335kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02307v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["francesco grassi", "reas loukas", "nathana\\\"el perraudin", "benjamin ricaud"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02307"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.02307.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Time-Vertex Signal Processing Framework Scalable processing and meaningful representations for time-series on graphs", "authors": ["Francesco Grassi", "Andreas Loukas", "Nathana\u00ebl Perraudin", "Benjamin Ricaud"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "A.

HARMONIC TIME-VERTEX ANALYSIS", "text": "With G = (V, E, WG) we denote the graph, where V denotes the quantity of nodes, E the quantity of edges, and WG the corresponding N \u00b7 N weight matrix. Furthermore, LG = DG \u2212 WG is the combinatorial laplac matrix, i.e. the finite difference approximation to the continuous laplac operator [17] or the LaplaceBeltrami operator for belt manifolds [35]. We assume that the signal is scanned on a graph in T consecutive regular intervals of the unit length. That is, if we denote the graph signal at the moment t with xt-RN, the time-changing graph signal corresponds to the matrix X = [x1, x2,..., xT]. We denote X, X-RN \u00b7 T and X-Rate, the complex conjugate and the hermitian of X. Furthermore, we refer to both X and its electrical signal (Nexsiversed time)."}, {"heading": "A. The joint time-vertex Fourier transform", "text": "The main idea of harmonic analysis is to convert a signal into oscillating modes, thanks to the Fourier transformation. For example, one analyzes the oscillations along the timeline by applying the discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) independently to each line of XDFT {X} = XU-X-T, (1) where the normalized DFT matrix is defined. (1) The Graph-Fourier transformation (GFT) [8], [36] allows us to analyze oscillations along the graph edges. Since each column of X represents a time instance, the GFT is the x-x shape of the JFT-x-x shape.

The most important discrete calculation in time is the difference of the first order operatorX (t).t \u2212 xt \u2212 1, recorded here with periodic boundary conditions. Hence, the symmetric time Laplacian matrix LT is the discrete second order in time with inverted signals XLT (t)."}, {"heading": "III. DYNAMICS OVER GRAPHS", "text": "This section further motivates the JFT by showing that it can be used to characterize two linear PDEs that develop above the graph through nuclei defined in the common frequency domain, and also to provide insights into standard non-linear PDEs used in epidemic modeling. Our interest in PDEs analysis is related to their ability to encode information about the structure of the underlying domain, whether continuous or discrete [38], [39] In addition, PDEs are not only simple but powerful models of many phenomena observed in reality, but also a motivation for the Fourier transformation [40], [41].5"}, {"heading": "A.

In the context of time-vertex analysis, the importance of fast common filtering is emphasized by increasing the dimensions of the problem. However, below, we will improve the state of the art by improving filtering approximation at a similar point (up to logarithmic factors). The Fast Fourier Chebyshev (FFC) algorithm is the basic idea of our algorithms to exploit the small complexity of FFT and perform graphs in the time-frequency domain."}, {"heading": "V. TIME-VERTEX DICTIONARIES AND FRAMES", "text": "So far, we have looked at the time-vertex signals through the lenses of the canonical and common Fourier base. However, in some cases it is beneficial to consider alternative representations as well. For example, in the classical case, the waveform and the short time that Fourier transforms may allow a time and frequency analysis of the signal. The purpose of this section is to show how to define analog representations for time-vertex signals, which can be used, for example, to generate features that are given to a classifier as input (see Section VI-C) or to regulate an optimization problem, such as (41) in Section VI-C.8. Classically, the atoms of representations are constructed by applying a transform (e.g. scaling or modulation) to a parent function and shifting the resulting functions."}, {"heading": "A. Joint time-vertex localization", "text": "The ability to localize a kernel over a certain time and vertex is a key component of our dictionary construction. In the following, we derive such a common localization operator as a generalization of the graph localization operator [12], [36], [44] which centers a core h (LG) on the vertex vmT Gm h = h (LG) \u03b4m = N \u2211 '= 1 h (\u03bb') u (m) u. \"(25) Above is a Kronecker delta centered at the vertex vm. (26) Similarly, in the common domain, we define the common localization operator as filtering with a two-dimensional Kronecker deltaT filter h (LG, LT) as a filter for the entire time. (26) It turns out that the common time-vertex localization operator has the advantages of both graph localization and traditional translation operators."}, {"heading": "B. Joint time-vertex dictionaries", "text": "We start with a maternal timevertex kernel h (\u03bb, \u03c9) and a transformation sz\u03bb, z\u03c9 (\u00b7, \u00b7), parameterized by some values [z\u03bb, z\u03c9] belonging to the finite 2D set Z\u03bb \u00b7 Z\u043e-R2 and controlling the shape of the nucleus along the vertex and the time domains. The transformed nucleus is then obtained by composition hz\u03bb, z\u043e (\u03bb, \u03c9) = h (sz\u03bb, z\u043e (\u03bb, \u03c9)). (29) We create our dictionary by transforming h (\u03bb, \u03c9) with all z\u03bb, z\u0435, z\u0435, Z\u0445 x-Z\u043e, (possibly) normalizing and together localizing the resulting nuclei hz\u03bb, z\u043e (\u03bb, \u043c) at each node m and at each time \u0456.

(46) Next, we will consider two interesting examples of the proposed dictionary construction, the generalizations of the short-term domain Fourier and wave network transformations [45], [46]: Short-time vertex Fourier Transform (STVFT). This form of transformation can be considered modulable. Nevertheless, we note that it is not a multiplication by a eigenvector in [36], [47]. Our construction is more akin to [48, Section 3]."}, {"heading": "C. Joint time-vertex frames", "text": "To make the proposed dictionaries and associated signal representations usable in practice, we next give answers to three key questions: (a) How can we efficiently calculate the representations (i.e., perform analysis and synthesis)? (b) How can we guarantee that the associated transformations are conditioned to be successfully inverted? (c) How can we efficiently invert them and restore the original signal? (c) The second point is particularly important because a well-conditioned transformation enables more robust representations, for example, when the dictionary is used to solve a synthesis or analysis regression problem with a sparse regression problem. (c) Efficient analysis and synthesis is particularly important because a well-conditioned transformation enables more robust representations, e.g. when the dictionary is used to solve a synthesis or analysis regression problem with a sparse regression problem."}, {"heading": "If 0 < A \u2264 B <\u221e, then Dh is a frame in the sense:", "text": "The proof of the theorem can be found in the appendix (see section A). The theorem states that if A > 0, no information is lost when the analysis operator is applied to a time-vertex signal, the transformation is thus invertable. Furthermore, the 10 ratio of the boundaries A / B with the condition number of the frame operator Sh {X} = D \u00b2 h {Dh {X}}} is crucial for efficient reconstruction if we want to recover the signal from its representation and solve an optimization problem. Efficient inversion.

EXPERIMENTS", "text": "The suitability of the time-vertex framework for various types of problems is illustrated by a variety of data sets: (a) dynamic meshes representing a walking dog and a dancing man; (b) the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) traffic dataset representing a high-resolution daily vehicle flow of 10 consecutive days on Sacramento highways measured every 5 minutes; (c) simulated SEIR or SEIRS-like epidemics across Europe; (d) the time-lapse video of Kuala Lumpur city center (KLCC); and (e) seismic waves recorded from geographically distributed seismic stations connected to the GeoNet network in New Zealand. Results suggest that a common analysis of time-vertex signals can bring benefits in signal denoising and recovery, learning and source localization problems."}, {"heading": "A. Compactness of representation", "text": "A key motivation behind the common harmonic analysis is the ability to encode time-dependent graphical signal developments in a compact way. Therefore, our first step will be to investigate the energy compression of the JFT transformation in four datasets: two meshes representing a dancer (N = 1502 points in R3 and T = 570 timestamps) and a dog walking (N = 2502 points in R3 and T = 52 timestamps), the PeMS traffic flow dataset (N = 710 stations measuring traffic over T = 2880 intervals of 5 minutes each), and the number of infected persons in a SEIRS epidemic (see section III-B for description). Transformations with good energy compression are desirable because they can well summarize and use the data to construct efficient regulators for regression problems. To measure energy compactness, we compress the DFT, GFT, and JFT effectiveness for each data set by the X coefficient of the magnitude X."}, {"heading": "B. Regression problems with joint variation priors", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "C. Overcomplete representations", "text": "Finally, we examine the utility of the STVFT and STVWT, respectively, as a feature we have used for dynamic clustering and as a dictionary to reveal the wave structure and epicenter of a seismic event. We consider the motion classification of a dynamic mesh representing the dancer as an additional, economical noise with a density of 0.1 with normally distributed entries and SNR of \u2212 20 dB and \u2212 10 dB. Our goal is to determine the phase of the dance (moving arms, stretching legs and bending body) on each frame by performing spectral clustering on some representations of the winding signal. To obtain the ground truth, we manually mark each frame and verify that the noiseless signal (i.e., the actual trajectory of the points in each window) was used to define the characteristics, a classification accuracy of 0.926."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper introduces a Time-Vertex Signal Processing Framework that facilitates the analysis of graph-structured data that also evolves over time. We motivate our framework by using the idea of partial differential equation in diagrams. We introduce common operators, such as time-vertex localization, and present a novel approach to greatly improve the accuracy of fast common filtering. We also show how to build time-vertex dictionaries that provide conditions for efficient invertex and construction examples.

Recently, ideas have begun to emerge related to the analysis of time-varying graph signals. This work aims to elevate the notion of joint harmonic analysis to a full-fledged framework denoted as Time-Vertex Signal Processing, that links together the time-domain signal processing techniques with the new tools of graph signal processing. This entails three main contributions: (a) We provide a formal motivation for harmonic time-vertex analysis as an analysis tool for the state evolution of simple Partial Differential Equations on graphs. (b) We improve the accuracy of joint filtering operators by up-to two orders of magnitude. (c) Using our joint filters, we construct time-vertex dictionaries analyzing the different scales and the local time-frequency content of a signal. The utility of our tools is illustrated in numerous applications and datasets, such as dynamic mesh denoising and classification, still-video inpainting, and source localization in seismic events. Our results suggest that joint analysis of time-vertex signals can bring benefits to regression and learning.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
