Introduction", "text": "Hindi exhibits considerable regularity in the allocation of the orthographic representation to pronunciation and is therefore very suitable for the automatic generation of pronunciation by a program with handwritten rules. In this essay, we describe the model developed to automatically generate output forms on two levels from the input forms of the Devnagari script in which Hindi is written - Phonemic1 and Prosodic Structure (PS). The essay is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the main points of a pronunciation dictionary relevant to the present work. Section 3 describes the pronunciation specifications for Hindi. Section 4 briefly describes the Devanagari script and the Hindi writing system.

Pronunciation Lexicon Specifications for Hindi", "text": "The features for pronunciation of the Hindi lexicon are as follows: (4) \u2022 Letter-to-tone conversion using IPA. \u2022 Marking syllable structures and marking as prominent and not prominent for further TTS and ASR applications. \u2022 Preparation of systematic variations in pronunciation of words in standard Hindi into two encyclopedias, Standard Formal and Standard Colloquial. \u2022 Interface pronunciation of words with stress marks. The above features have been taken into account, with multiple uses for learners of Hindi, TTS and ASR applications, as well as for users of screen reader software including Hindi. Two pronunciation levels are created: the level of segmental IPA symbols with prosodic structure in terms of division of symbols and prominence (< PS >) and the level of segmental IPA symbols with stress marks (< phonemes >), as shown in Figures 1 and 2 below."}, {"heading": "4. Hindi Writing and Devnagari Script", "text": "The official script of Hindi is Devnagari or Devanagari. It belongs to a class of writing systems known as alpha-syllabic, that is, a combination of alphabetic and syllabic systems. Writing systems are alphabetical if their units stand for phonetic / phonetic vowels and consonants (e.g. English, German). They are syllabic if each orthographic unit in them represents a syllable (e.g. Hankul for Koreans). Hindi writes in them linguistic vowels that are on several levels - phonetic, phonological, phonological and morphological."}, {"heading": "5. Essential background to the Model", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1. Variety of Hindi", "text": "There are two related dictionaries for two types of standard Hindi described here - Standard Formal Hindi (SFH) and Standard Colloquial Hindi (SCH), but they are in a subset ratio. SCH is a superset of SFH. SCH mainly contains two points of difference in the segmental realization of words from SFH, as indicated in (6) below. (6) \u2022 SFH distinguishes the vowel length between / i: / and / u u: / throughout the word; SCH neutralizes them verbatim, e.g. SFH SCH Gloss @ \"tithi\" @ tithi: guest s @ \"ma: dhi s @\" ma: dhi: trance / mausoleum \u2022 Internal words [@] are generally \"deleted\" in SCH under certain circumstances (as discussed extensively in [15, 8, 7] but in SFH, e.g.SFH SCH Gloss \"k @ femoleum:...\""}, {"heading": "5.2. Rule-based generation of outputs", "text": "To achieve this goal, a well-ordered set of rules was formulated in three different steps: the first set of rules was characterized by correspondence between the graphs and their IPA equivalents; all graphic forms were considered as single consonants and vowel letters; and as CV, CCV, and CCV aksharas, e.g., a / @ /, kF / ki: /, yA / kja: /, - / F / stri: / The second set of rules related to changes in graphical phoneme correspondence due to segmental processes, which included (a) definitive vowel extension, with all short vowels corresponding to their long vocalisations, e.g. aEtET / @ tithi / \u2192 / @ tithi."}, {"heading": "5.3. Treatment of exceptions", "text": "In order to integrate efficient automatic generation of orthographic forms of Hindi words into prosodic structures and IPA symbols by means of handwritten rules into the model, it was necessary to include an exception component fed with the output of predefined words that do not conform to the rest of the results (see [20] with a similar proposal for Tamil), essentially the following exception components: (7) a. Native vocabulary with some prefixes and compositions without internal word boundaries. For example: / sus @ j / \"good time\" and / ku-s @ m \"bad time,\" in which the schwa in the first syllable is incorrectly deleted- * [susm @ j] and * [kusm @ j] in place of [sus @ m @ j] and [sus @ m @ j].iiii."}, {"heading": "6. Evaluation", "text": "The Standard Colloquial Hindi PLS program was used for evaluation because it contained more features for evaluation than the Standard Formal Hindi program, as discussed in Section 5.1. The data used for evaluation came from a BBC corpus of 28731 words. An expert in the pronunciation of the words first commented on the words and then compared the output of the machine with the annotated list. The evaluation of the model took into account the following factors: a. when evaluating the regular features of the pronunciation, only the regular features of the pronunciation. b. A transcription was considered correct if it contained one of the main features of the Akshara-to-tone match in the expected context, as described above. c. When evaluating the model for the regular features of the pronunciation, the factors that related to exceptions had to be excluded from the total number of words tested, the number of words with the diacritical bindu and chandradu were considered relevant for the realization of the pronunciation characteristics of the specific pronunciation."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "The development of a program for generating a pronunciation dictionary for standard Hindi required addressing several of the problems described above. It began by generating initial graphs of phoneme correspondence. However, in an attempt to generate the final output automatically at < phonem > level, it was found that the hybrid form of Hindi orthography with both superficial and deep correspondence made it necessary to automatically generate the internal word prosodic structure on which the main aspects of segmental realization of forms depended. The current model of pronunciation dictionary for Hindi can easily be applied to other Akshara-Asian orthography systems with mixed orthography. Furthermore, the contributions go beyond the scope of a pronunciation dictionary and have general applicability to the automation of syllable processes and stress patterns in South Asian languages."}, {"heading": "8.
