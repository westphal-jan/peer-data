Tool condition is crucial to ensure the good quality of products: Worn tools affect not only the surface quality but also the dimensional accuracy, which means higher reject rate of the products. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify tool failures before it occurs on the fly. While various versions of intelligent tool condition monitoring have been proposed, most of them suffer from a cognitive nature of traditional machine learning algorithms. They focus on the how to learn process without paying attention to other two crucial issues: what to learn, and when to learn. The what to learn and the when to learn provide self regulating mechanisms to select the training samples and to determine time instants to train a model. A novel tool condition monitoring approach based on a psychologically plausible concept, namely the metacognitive scaffolding theory, is proposed and built upon a recently published algorithm, recurrent classifier (rClass). The learning process consists of three phases: what to learn, how to learn, when to learn and makes use of a generalized recurrent network structure as a cognitive component. Experimental studies with real-world manufacturing data streams were conducted where rClass demonstrated the highest accuracy while retaining the lowest complexity over its counterparts.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 May 2017 12:16:16 GMT  (1001kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02477v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mahardhika pratama", "eric dimla", "chow yin lai", "edwin lughofer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02477"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.02477.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Metacognitive Learning Approach for Online Tool Condition Monitoring", "authors": ["Mahardhika Pratama", "Eric Dimla", "Chow Yin Lai", "Edwin Lughofer"], "emails": ["pratama@ieee.org", "dimla@utb.edu.bn", "chowyin.lai@rmit.edu.au", "edwin.lughofer@jku.at"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2.

The machine used in the experiment was a variable speed, the Lang Swing J6 lathe. The two tool inserts used by a negative tool holder were cemented in the form of tungsten carbide coatings with chemical vapor deposition and consisted of grades of the \"throwaway threshold,\" which are inseparable with integrated chip-crusher geometry held in place. P15 had a thick wear-resistant coating on a hard, resistant substrate, while P25 had a thick (10m) layer of Al2O3 at the top of a medium-sized titanium carbon nitride (CN), which gives it high wear resistance, giving it a high wear resistance."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "It proposes a metacognitive approach to tool state monitoring, developed with a recently published metacognitive learning algorithm, the Recurrent Classifier (rClass). rClass represents a synergy between the metacognitive model and scaffolding theory that brings a plug-and-play learner one step closer. The effectiveness of rClass for PHM was studied in the tool wear prediction of a Lang Swing J6 lathe, compared with state-of-the-art classifiers, and it was found that rClass delivered the most encouraging accuracy while maintaining the most compact and economical structure. In addition, rClass offered lower labeling costs and faster training speed than its counterparts. Our future work will be dedicated to improving the robustness of our algorithm in the face of loud data and missing values."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The fourth author recognizes the Austrian Research Funding Association (FFG) within the framework of the \"IKT of the future\" program (contract # 849962), as well as the Austrian COMET-K2 program of the Linz Mechatronics Center (LCM).References to the International Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning, the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning and Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Functioning of the Func"}], "references": [{"title": "Tool Condition Monitoring System: A Review", "author": ["N.
