However, the amount of geographic information avail- able on Twitter is low, which makes the pursuit of many applications challenging. Under such circumstances, estimating the location of a tweet is an important goal of the study. Unlike most previous studies that estimate the pre-defined district as the classification task, this study employs a probability distribution to represent richer information of the tweet, not only the location but also its ambiguity. To realize this modeling, we propose the convolutional mixture density network (CMDN), which uses text data to estimate the mixture model parameters. Experimentally obtained results reveal that CMDN achieved the highest prediction performance among the method for predicting the exact coordinates. It also provides a quantitative representation of the location ambiguity for each tweet that properly works for extracting the reliable location estimations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 05:50:47 GMT  (1957kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02750v1", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hayate iso", "shoko wakamiya", "eiji aramaki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02750"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.02750.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Density Estimation for Geolocation via Convolutional Mixture Density Network", "authors": ["Hayate Iso", "Shoko Wakamiya", "Eiji Aramaki"], "emails": ["iso.hayate.id3@is.naist.jp", "wakamiya@is.naist.jp", "aramaki@is.naist.jp"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This information is indispensable for various practical applications such as the early detection of earthquakes (Sakaki et al., 2010), the evaluation of dispersion of infectious diseases (Broniatowski et al., 2013) and the assessment of user behaviour during an election period (Caldarelli et al., 2014). However, application performance is strongly dependent on the number of geo-tagged tweets, which account for less than 0.5% of all tweets (Cheng et al., 2010).In order to expand the possibilities of geographical information, great efforts have been made to automatically specify the geolocation (Han et al., 2014). These studies are roughly divided into two aspects, the user level (Cheng et al., 2010; Han et al., 2014; Jurgens et al., 2015) and the measurement level (Dredze et al.)."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "Social media geolocation has been carried out on various platforms such as Facebook (Backstrom et al., 2010), Flickr (Serdyukov et al., 2009) and Wikipedia (Lieberman and Lin, 2009). Twitter geolocation, in particular, is the dominant field of all due to its availability (Han et al., 2014). Twitter geolocation methods are not limited to text information. Various information can facilitate geolocation performance, such as meta-information (time (Dredze et al., 2016) and estimated age and gender (Pavalanathan et al., 2015), social network structures (Jurgens et al., 2015; Rahimi et al., 2015) and user movements (Liu and Huang, 2016).

This regression formulation is well suited to solving well-defined problems, and both the input and output correspond 1: 1. Our Tweet corpus is fundamentally incompatible with this assumption, so a more flexible model must be used to represent the richer information. In this section, we propose a novel architecture for text-to-density estimation, Convolutional Mixture Density Network (CMDN), the extension of Bishop's Mixture Density Network (1994). Unlike the regression approach, which directly represents the output values y as well as the probability distribution, CMDN can absorb more complex information than the probability distribution.

Production distance distributions are shown in Figure 5. Although \"2 loss\" represents the worst performance among CNN-based models (Table 3), it represents the lowest outage rate.

We can conclude that the difference between the competitive model CNN-l1 and our proposed model MD1 is the probability that MD1 is the probability."}, {"heading": "7 Future work", "text": "This study evaluated the performance of our proposed model, CMDN, based solely on text data. Although a purely text-based estimate is easily applicable to existing resources, we still have room for improvement in prediction performance. Twitter's Geolocation PredictionShared Task Winner, Miura et al. (2016), suggested that the unified architecture should handle multiple metadata such as user location, user description and time zone for predicting geolocations. CMDN can integrate this information in the same way. Furthermore, Liu and Huang (2016) report that the user's location strongly influences location prediction for a single tweet. For example, a routine tweet alone using text content is fundamentally unpredictable, but if the user's location is known, this information is a valuable clue for evaluating the tweet. As a future work, we plan to develop a unified architecture that could provide the movement information of a network using a recursive coordinator, as opposed to the neural coordination of the network."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "Our proposed model, CMDN, not only provided high accuracy of our experimental data, but also extracted reliable geolocalized tweets based on probability thresholds. The results show that CMDN only needs the content of the tweet message to identify its geolocation, without the need for meta-information to be processed. As a result, CMDN can help expand the fields in which geographical information applications can be used."}], "references": [{"title": "Find me if you can: improving geographical prediction with social and spatial proximity", "author": ["Lars Backstrom", "Eric Sun", "Cameron Marlow."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web.

However, the amount of geographic information available on Twitter is low, which makes the pursuit of many applications challenging. Under such circumstances, estimating the location of a tweet is an important goal of the study. Unlike most previous studies that estimate the pre-defined district as the classification task, this study employs a probability distribution to represent richer information of the tweet, not only the location but also its ambiguity. To realize this modeling, we propose the convolutional mixture density network (CMDN), which uses text data to estimate the mixture model parameters. Experimentally obtained results reveal that CMDN achieved the highest prediction performance among the method for predicting the exact coordinates. It also provides a quantitative representation of the location ambiguity for each tweet that properly works for extracting the reliable location estimations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
