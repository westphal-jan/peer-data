BIOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS", "text": "Evolutionary psychologists [15] believe that certain actions and behaviors observed in humans do not necessarily require complicated cognitive decision-making mechanisms; they are specific programs that have evolved to deal with certain recurring problems; they also assume the existence of a \"super program\" - an emotion designed by natural selection to select, coordinate, and recalibrate a subset of many mutually exclusive behaviors (subprograms) so that the net yield is optimal for dealing with the specific problem and maximizing the survival chances of the individual. We adopt this philosophy of emotions in shaping local decision-making rules that determine the emotional state of the individual, which maximizes the success of the system by completing the given task. Hunger is an emotional impulse that ensures that a living being eats the appropriate amount of food for survival. We usually associate it with two states: saturated and starving."}, {"heading": "III. METAHEURISTICS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Behaviors", "text": "Each robot performs two or more sub-tasks, which can be divided according to heuristic use: \u2022 Random Search: The robot searches for prey by randomly exploring the field within the given time interval. \u2022 Directional Search: The robot searches for prey in a certain direction along which a transmit signal is sent. It continuously moves toward the transmit signal, unless it finds a closer signal or locates a prey. \u2022 Pastures: Once the robot finds a prey that it can only execute when it is directly at the prey, it stops and sits down to remove the prey at a certain rate until its container is fully filled. \u2022 Invitation: To communicate that it has found something of interest, it turns on a pherobbot that sends out a certain decision that causes the others who are omnipresent."}, {"heading": "B. The hunger-loneliness metaheuristic", "text": "The interaction of each robot in a time step with the rest of the swarm is determined by its current emotional state. This, in turn, depends on the value of hunger (H) and loneliness (L parameters, both of which are limited within a given time interval [1, 100]. The two parameters are updated based on the following rules: \u2022 Hunger Update Rule: Increase or decrease of H within the given limits, depending on whether a robot grazes its prey in the current time interval or not. \u2022 Solitude Update Rule: Increase or decrease of L within the given limits, depending on whether a grazing robot is within a certain proximity to other grazing robots. Continue with L if the robot is not grazing in the current time interval. \u2022 Each robot is in one of four emotional states, depending on the value of H and L. The robot only sends an invitation when its hunger is satisfied and its loneliness is high (HLLLH). Hunger is satisfied (if it has a limited energy state, \u2264 if this one is high: H and H is specified)."}, {"heading": "C. The random search metaheuristic", "text": "This is the first of two control metaheuristics with which we compare the performance of our algorithm. Each robot searches independently for prey and roams when it finds it. However, no robot sends invitation signals and there is no explicit collaboration with other robots."}, {"heading": "D. The random search-immediate invite metaheuristic", "text": "This metaheuristics of control attaches great importance to cooperation, insofar as each robot sends out invitation signals as soon as it grazes immediately at the place where the prey is found. Robots responding to an invitation embark on a targeted search towards the point where the prey is located."}, {"heading": "IV. EMPIRICAL STUDY", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Experimental setup", "text": "In this study, we do not consider any kinematic or dynamic limitations for the robots. Robots placed in the field can move freely while conducting a random search. Limitations for the robots include a fixed sending range for invitations, and even if a robot recognizes loot, it will not be able to determine the size of the loot. Furthermore, each robot has a fixed container size of 100 with a grazing rate of RG = 1. During the random search, the robot embarks on a two-dimensional random path [18] in which its path in N time steps consists of N-two-dimensional vectors with random orientation and fixed size l. For such a random walk, the root-center square distance travelled after N steps of length l is indicated by drms = l \u00b0 N, where drms is so important for the design of the environment that the spatial distribution of the loot is large that the robots can ideally cover the entire area within the given time."}, {"heading": "B. Heuristic performance measure", "text": "Similar to other analyses of food problems [12], we use an efficiency measurement, which is the ratio of the total income derived during the solving of the problem to the costs incurred during this period. In our special variant of the food problem, we define income as the net loot content removed during the N-time step of the simulation. Costs incurred are the total energy expended by the robots for the transmission of invitation signals. Assuming that the consumed power during the transmission of an invitation is constant during a period of time, the heuristic efficiency during a run of the algorithm is given as as\u03bd = Total Prey Content P \u00d7 robotsInvite Duration (1)."}, {"heading": "C. Simulation results", "text": "The simulation is carried out in the MATLAB simulation environment in a field with 60 robots assigned to a loot whose cumulative content is within a given simulation time of N = 1500 6000. It is assumed that the robots perform discrete length steps of l = 0.5. The range of the invitation is 30 and the power P, which is used to transmit an invitation within a given time step, is 0.05. Prey is small circular areas of radius 1. There are two types of prey, small ones containing 50 quantities of loot, and large ones containing 2900. The loot is randomly distributed within the search area, which is limited by an imaginary edge length of 40. The robots are placed on two different patterns in the field, as shown in Fig.2 (a) and Fig.2 (b). Each configuration is simulated for 500 runs and two cumulative performance measures, Fig.3 and Fig.4, are reported."}, {"heading": "D. Discussion", "text": "Case A: Robots scattered in fields from two locations As shown in Fig.2 (a), the robots are released into the field from two opposite corners at the start of the simulation, and the percentage of prey grazed is measured for all three heuristics over five hundred runs. We observe from Fig.3 (a) that hunger-solitude heuristics removes fifty percent of the total prey content over four hundred runs. Random search-instant invitation heuristics does the same for only two hundred and fifty runs. However, as shown in Fig.4 (a), it is the measure of performance that shows that random search-instant heuristic tendencies invite to make the apparent gains in loot removal an expensive affair, as the energy for making blind invites.Case B: Robots dispersed from four locations in field-fig.2 (b) show the robots being split up by ten groups."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "We presented a new metaheuristics inspired by emotions observed in social animals to allow a swarm of robots to organize themselves and exhibit emerging behavior in the form of distance from randomly dispersed prey in the search area. There are several limitations that require further research, including the use of a more detailed robotic model that takes into account collision avoidance and robotic dynamics. In future work, we would also like to explore whether it is possible to integrate a form of learning where the values hunger (H) and loneliness (L) parameters, where the emotional change takes place, can depend on the configuration of the environment."}], "references": [{"title": "Communication in reactive multiagent robotic systems", "author": ["T.
