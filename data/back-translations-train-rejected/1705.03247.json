A slight modulation in prosody can lead to changes in the meaning of an utterance. Prosody is studied at various levels in various branches of science and engineering. In linguistics, the leading branches contributing to knowledge of prosody are phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics and psycholinguistics. In cognitive science, neurophysiological traits such as the spectrotemporal property of cortical oscillation in theta, beta, gamma and delta band are used as keywords for prosody research. Finally, engineers use these traits to develop an automatic module for categorizing prosodic events. The modern standard Hindi is an Indo-Aryan language spoken mainly in North India, and also an official language of Fiji. It is spoken by 422 million Hindi speakers in India (census 2001), and prosody is the prosody language that follows the SOdi word synthesis with the order of the European Hindi language."}, {"heading": "WORD PROSODY", "text": "Rhythm is perceived because of the varying degrees of meaning or stress of certain syllables.

Their analysis suggests that there is less agreement for prosodic prominence and prosodic phrases between non-experts as well as between experts and non-expert notes.

The study reported an accuracy of 88% in determining the pitch pattern associated with syllables. (Madhukumar et. al., 2013) examined the pattern of f0 contours in Hindi explanatory sentences and question sets. Declarative sentences show declension in f0 contour, while the sentences in question exhibit rising f0 contour.
