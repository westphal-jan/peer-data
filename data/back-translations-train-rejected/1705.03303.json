Introduction", "text": "Process Mining [1] is a fast-growing discipline that focuses on analyzing events that are logged during the execution of a business process. Events contain information about what was done, by whom, for whom, where, when, etc. Such event data is often readily available from information systems such as ERP, CRM, or BPM systems. Process Discovery, which plays a prominent role in process mining, is tasked with automatically generating a process model that accurately describes a business process based on such event data. Many process discovery techniques have been developed over the last decade (e.g. [2, 3, 4, 5]) that produces process models in various forms, such as Petri networks [6], process trees [7], YAWL models [8], and BPMN models [9]. The process model, which is tracked by process discovery techniques, ideally enables all the behavior observed in the event log [7], YAWL models [8] and BPMN models [9] that is observed by process discovery techniques, which should be observed in the event log (which is called fitness more than it should be at the same time)."}, {"heading": "2.

Precision Metrics", "text": "In this section, we provide an overview of precision measurements developed in the field of process mining and validate the axioms for precision measurements introduced in Section 3 for each of these measurements."}, {"heading": "4.1. Soundness", "text": "Greco et al. [10] were the first to propose precision measurement, defining it as the number of unique executions of the process seen in the event log divided by the number of unique paths through the process model. In practice, this measurement is not applicable since it is zero if the process model allows an infinite number of paths through the model. Any process model with a loop has an accuracy of 0. Newer precision measurements are able to calculate the precision of a model for an event log, even if the models allow infinite behavior."}, {"heading": "4.2. Behavioral Appropriateness", "text": "Rozinat and Van der Aalst [11] have proposed simple behavioral appropriateness = precision measurement, which refers to the average number of transitions allowed during repetition. [11] The authors observed that simple behavioral appropriateness depends on the structure of the model and therefore does not depend exclusively on the behavior that allows it, so A4 does not require appropriateness for this measure. Furthermore, for a process model that contains silent transitions or duplicate designations, it is possible that a particular track can be reproduced in multiple ways, where the average number of transitions allowed may depend on the chosen repetition path through the model. This repetition path through the model is chosen arbitrarily from the possible ways in which the track can be reproduced. This shows that A1 is not considered simple behavioral appropriateness, as it is not deterministic. In the same paper, Rozinat and van der Aalst [11] propose progressive behavioral appropriateness, which is appropriateness independent of the model structure."}, {"heading": "4.3. Escaping Edges Precision", "text": "This is not the first time that a different state is allowed in the prefix automation phase than the next activity, which is never observed in the event log after this prefix, but as escaping edges.In the later paper [18, 19], alignments [20] are used to calculate the prefix automation on the basis of the original event log, causing the precision measurement to mismatch traces that are not in the language of the model."}, {"heading": "4.4. Negative Event Precision", "text": "The negative events are used for each position in the event log, i.e. for each event e in each track of the log, a series of events is induced that could not have occurred instead of the event e. De Weerdt et al. [23] proposed precision measurement based on negative events, behavioral precision (pB), which is closely linked to how precision is defined in the field of data retrieval. Negative event precision considers a process model as a binary classification that determines whether a particular event can occur, and then evaluates the precision of that classification in relation to the induced negative events as ground truth. For a given trace prefix, events are defined as events that are both possible (i.e. a transition with that event is activated) and logged (this event is not an event)."}, {"heading": "4.5.

Contexts With Unclear Requirements for Precision Metrics", "text": "The axioms introduced in section 3 can be regarded as necessary conditions for precision measurements, but they do not mention precision in some contexts. Figure 8a shows a situation in which both L-L (M1), L-L (M2), and L-L (M1), L-L (M2), L-L (M2), and L-L (M2) allow for (possibly infinite) different behavior, which in L. Precision measurements deal with this situation by quantifying the amount of behavior of M1 and M2. However, there are no obvious formal properties showing how the precision of M1 and M2 should relate to L. In addition, all axioms define desired properties of precision measurements when the event protocol L matches the behavior of the model M, i.e., L-L models that do not fit the model M, i.e. L-models are reproduced in practice."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions & Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we provide a set of minimum requirements for precision measurements by axioms. We validated these axioms for existing measurements.

In addition, we would like to use the insights from the evaluation of the axioms on the measurements to either repair one of the existing measurements or find a completely new measurement that fulfills all five axioms.

"abstractText": "In process mining, precision measures are used to quantify how much a process model overapproximates the behavior seen in an event log. Although several measures have been proposed throughout the years, no research has been done to validate whether these measures achieve the intended aim of quantifying over-approximation in a consistent way for all models and logs. This paper fills this gap by postulating a number of axioms for quantifying precision consistently for any log and any model. Further, we show through counter-examples that none of the existing measures consistently quantifies precision.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
