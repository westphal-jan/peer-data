Later, these compositional models were also introduced into the theory of possibility [Vejnarova, 1998, 2007] (here the models are parameterized by a continuous t-standard) and ten years ago also in the theory of evidence [Jirous, ek et al.]."}, {"heading": "2 Basic Concepts and Notation", "text": "In this section, we will briefly recall the basic concepts and notation needed to understand the contribution."}, {"heading": "2.1 Variables and Distributions", "text": "For an index set N = {1, 2,..., n}, {Xi} i-N is a variable system, where each Xi has its values in a finite set Xi and XN = X1 \u00b7 X2 \u00b7... \u00b7 Xn is the cartesian product of these sets.

(2) Again, there are several generalizations of this term for conditional independence, see e.g. [Moral and Cano, 2002], but since the authors propose the following definition as the most suitable for the marginal problem, it also seems to be a suitable concept in our case, since the operator of this composition can also be used as a tool for solving a marginal problem, see e.g. [Moral and Cano, 2002], but since the following definition appears by the authors to be the most suitable concept for our marginal problem, it may also be used as the most suitable one for our marginal problem."}, {"heading": "2.4 Polyhedral Geometry", "text": "A convex polytopic can be defined in many ways, depending on what is more suitable for the problem at hand. Gr\u00c3 \u00bc nbaum's definition [Gr\u00c3 \u00bc nbaum et al., 1967] refers to a convex set of points in space. Other important definitions are: as an intersection of half-spaces (H-representation) and as a convex shell of a set of vertibles (V-representation). For a compact convex polytopic, the minimum V-representation is unique and is given by the amount of vertibles of the polytopic [Gr\u00c3 nbaum et al., 1967]. In our experiments, we use both H and V-representations. However, for the purpose of displaying the polytopic within the paper, only V-representation is used. As mentioned in the introduction, a creative quantity is a convex polytopic (limited polyhedron convection) in | XN | dimensional space. Each dimension corresponds to an element of an element of a space X-XN combination (N)."}, {"heading": "3 Composition Operator", "text": "In this section, we recall the new definition of the composition operator for authentication sets introduced in [Vejnarova \u0301, 2016].

Let us consider two index sets K, L, and N. We do not set constraints on K and L; they can, but must not be resolved, and one can be a subset of the other. Let us let P1 and P2 be two probability distributions of (groups of) variables XK and XL; then (P1 P2) (XK-L) = P1 (XK) \u00b7 P2 (XL) P2 (XK-L), (4) whenever P1 (XK-L) and P2 (XK-L); otherwise it remains undefined.

Its last point characterizes the state in which a joint extension of M1 and M2 can be achieved. 1Let us note that the definition is based on Moral's concept of conditional independence with relaxing convectivity. (Lemma 3.2) For two credal sets M1 and M2 describing XK and XL, the following properties apply: 1. M1 M2 is a credal theorem describing XK. (M1 M2) However, this theorem describes XK 2.

For square programming methods - i.e., in case we find a projection of a certain vertex onto a certain polytope (we have taken Euclidean distance into account in this paper) - we have used methods of square programming [Gould and Toint, 2000], which were implemented in the square package [original by Berwin A. Turlach R port of Andreas 2013]. In order to convert various extensions into a higher dimensional space - as described in Definition 3.1 - we have taken advantage of the equivalence of hand-V representations of convex polyopes.

It seems useful, since composition can hardly be done without this computational support (with the exception of the simplest examples). Nevertheless, it is only the first step in the construction of multidimensional models. The repetitive application of the composition operator is theoretically solved for so-called perfect sequences of doctrines, but the computational problems have not yet been solved. And the problems associated with other generation sequences could be another direction of research, shifting the distance from Euclidean to some divergences of probability distributions, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, total variation, or another f-divergence [Vajda, 1989].Last but not least, a number of theoretical doctrines can be solved between other problems in relation to other models."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Project 16- 12010S)."}], "references": [{"title": "rcdd: Computational Geometry, 2016", "author": ["ten by Komei Fukuda"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Fukuda.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Fukuda.", "year": 2016}], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Recently introduced composition operator for credal sets is an analogy of such operators in probability, possibility, evidence and valuationbased systems theories.
