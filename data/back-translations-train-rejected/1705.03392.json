Additional to epistemic modalities, the logic therefore contains two types of dynamic modalities, for sending messages and for receiving messages. The semantics defines truth relative to the current state of reception of messages for all agents. This means that knowledge need not be truthful, because some messages may not have been received by the knowing agent. Messages that are announcements may also result in partial synchronization, namely when an agent learns from receiving an announcement that other announcements must already have been received by other agents. We give detailed examples of the semantics, and prove several semantic results, including that: after an announcement an agent knows that a proposition is true, if and only if on condition of the truth of that announcement, the agent knows that after that announcement and after any number of other agents also receiving it, the proposition is true. We show that on multi-agent epistemic models, each formula in asynchronous announcement logic is equivalent to a formula in epistemic logic.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 15:30:47 GMT  (19kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03392v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 13 May 2017 14:23:20 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03392v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DC cs.LO", "authors": ["hans van ditmarsch"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03392"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.03392.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 5.03 392v 2 [cs.A I] 1 3M ay2 017Asynchronous Announcements Hans van Ditmarsch, LORIA - CNRS / University of Lorraine16 May 2017"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "(...).

Given a group A of agents that is uncertain about a set of propositional variables P , including higher-order uncertainty (agent a does not know p but considers it possible that agent b knows p), they are simultaneously informed by an outsider of new information. The assumption is that the information is true (reliable) and that it is common knowledge among the agents that all agents receive the information. We consider a version of truthful public announcement logic where announcements are still truthful and (in some sense) public, but where they may not be received instantly by the agents. Let us illustrate this by an example. Consider two agents Anne (a) and Bill (b), and two propositional variables p and q. Anne knows the truth about p and Bill knows the truth about q, and this is common knowledge between them. In fact, p and q are both true. A truthful public announcement of p\u2228q is now made. The model encoding the uncertainty of Anne and Bill and the model transition resulting from the announcement are as follows\u2014 we represent Anne\u2019s uncertainty by a-labelled links (representing indistinguishable states) and Bill\u2019s uncertainty by b-labelled links; the actual state is framed. States have been given mnemonic names reflecting the valuation of atoms in that state, e.g., pq is the state where p is false and q is true.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
