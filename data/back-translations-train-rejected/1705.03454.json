Portner's (2007) formal model includes imperative statements whose conventional effect updates an abstract \"to-do list\" of an addressee. Recent debates have raised the question of whether this effect is actually built into the semantics of the imperative, or whether its directional power is resolved by pragmatic thinking in context (Condoravdi and Lauer, 2012; Kaufmann, 2016). This paper synthesizes these intuitions from the theory of commands with more recent computational work on natural linguistic pragmatics (Vogel et al., 2013, 2014; Degen et al., 2013) and collaborative dialogue (Chai et al., 2014)."}, {"heading": "3 The Cards corpus", "text": "The Cards Corpus is a set of 1,266 transcripts from a two-player, collaborative and web-based game. It is well suited to studying the pragmatics of commands, as it records both the utterances made and the actions taken during a game. At the start of the game, players \"positions are randomly initialized on a two-dimensional, grid-like game board. Cards from a conventional 52-card deck are randomly scattered across the game board. Players are asked to perform the following task: Collect six consecutive cards of a particular color (decide which color fits together) or determine that this is impossible. Each of you can hold only three cards at a time, so you need to coordinate your efforts. You can talk what you want, but you can only perform a limited number of movements. In addition to the fact that players can hold only three cards at a time, the game is further restricted so that players can only see their own locations, so they can only see their respective locations within the game board, and thus only have to view their respective locations."}, {"heading": "4 Command types in the Cards Corpus", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules that they have shown in recent years, and they will be able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "5 Common Ground Effects on the Directive Force of Locative Utterances", "text": "We try to understand how the discourse context of a game can influence the interpretation of local utterances as commands. Therefore, we construct a binary classification task in which we test how the role of a local utterance can be solved in context, as evidenced by the actions that are carried out following the utterance. In our task, a label indicates the follow-up of the addressee in the form of action in order to cancel the card in question, signal their intention to act, or ask a clarifying question about its whereabouts.

This results in 55 different transcripts representing 94 statements with this particular phenomena. Our common comments include the following information about the state of play indicated by the player's statements: cards in the hands of the player, player location, known information about the existence or location of cards, players \"strategic statements about cards needed, and whether a player is able to act in relation to an issue card."}, {"heading": "5.2 Experiments", "text": "Our goal in designing this task is to investigate the link between general knowledge and the illocutionary effects of local utterances.

We also combine the two most powerful similarities. We report the results of our experiments using a formula 1 measure and a 0.8 / 0.2 train / test distribution of our data in Table 1. We see that our context-sensitive individual functions significantly outperform our basic functions, with the Bigram model also using 2,916 unique lexical features, suggesting that it is a greatly overspecified model for our measured data size. We find that our context-sensitive individual functions significantly outperform our basic functions. Our Explicit-Goal feature outperforms the edit-distance feature by about 14%, indicating that local expressions are often interpreted as commands in the presence of an explicit, common target."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have conducted a comprehensive study of command types such as those present in the card corpus. Using the corpus as a test bed for grounded natural language interaction between agents with a common goal, we describe a variety of expressions that can function as indirect commands when viewed in context. In particular, locative expressions that are not usually associated with command interpretations turn out to be commands when viewed in the context of situational constraints within the context of collaborative interaction. We are developing a predictive task to show that models with carefully designed features that incorporate game status information can help agents effectively execute such pragmatic conclusions."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank Christopher Potts and all anonymous reviewers for their valuable insights and feedback."}], "references": [{"title": "Analyzing intention in utterances", "author": ["J.F.
