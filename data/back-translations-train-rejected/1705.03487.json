Therefore, there is an emerging consensus that public health efforts should focus on developing innovative technology to change dietary habits in order to become healthier. While there is compelling research in nutritional sciences on what makes a recipe healthy [2], this does not necessarily mean that such a recipe is tailored to one's own dietary preferences. Furthermore, the Japanese dietary style as measured in the 1970s is considered healthy [3]. Recipes in such a Japanese style are not limited to such a public health perspective for those who prefer a South American dietary style, with a growing variety of personal dietary preferences and dietary styles, personalized information systems that can turn a recipe into a selected dietary style that a user might prefer would help food companies and professional chefs create new recipes."}, {"heading": "2 Architecture of recommendation system", "text": "Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of the recommendation system, which consists of two steps: 1) identification and visualization of the dietary style mix of a recipe; and 2) algorithm that transforms a particular recipe into a selected regional / rural style. Details of the steps are described as follows."}, {"heading": "2.1 Step 1: Identification and visualization of a recipe\u2019s dietary style mixture", "text": "The neural network model was constructed as shown in Figure 2.When we enter a recipe, this model classifies which country or which regional cuisine the recipe belongs to. Input is a vector with the dimension of the total number of ingredients contained in the data set, and only the indices of the ingredients contained in the input recipe are 1, otherwise they are 0.There are two hidden layers. Therefore, this model can consider a combination of ingredients to predict the probability of the country. Also, for the hidden layer, dropout is used by randomly (20%) setting the value of the node to 0. Thus, a robust network is constructed. In this study, the dimension of the last layer is the number of countries, here 20 countries. In the last layer, we convert it to a probability value by using the softmax function, which represents the probability that the recipe belongs to that country.In this study, we have a labeled grain of the network Yasymatic network of this 74-7ma classified into Japanese information, where we use the neural network 7% accurately in this classification."}, {"heading": "2.2 Step 2: Recommendation algorithm for transforming dietary style", "text": "If you want to turn a particular recipe into a recipe that has a high probability of a particular country by changing only one ingredient, should that ingredient be used alternatively? If we change the one ingredient in a particular country, we can also calculate the probability number of each ingredient by using the above neural network models. If we want to change the recipe to have a high probability of a specific country, we can only find certain ingredients that maximize the following probability. In this system, we want to select ingredients that are similar to ingredients xi + xj) (1), where the recipe is the recipe. However, with this method, regardless of the ingredients xi, only certain ingredients of the country c are that we want to select ingredients that are similar to ingredients xi and have a high probability of the country c."}, {"heading": "3 Experiment", "text": "As an example of our proposed system, we transformed a traditional Japanese sukiyaki in French style.
