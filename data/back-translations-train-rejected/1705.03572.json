Imaging-based, or radiomics-driven, detection methods have been developed to aid diagnosticians, but largely rely on hand-crafted features which may not fully encapsulate the differences between cancerous and healthy tissue. Recently, the concept of discovery radiomics was introduced, where custom abstract features are discovered from readily available imaging data. We propose a novel evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach based on evolutionary deep intelligence. Motivated by patient privacy concerns and the idea of operational artificial intelligence, the evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach organically evolves increasingly more efficient deep radiomic sequencers that produce significantly more compact yet similarly descriptive radiomic sequences over multiple generations. As a result, this framework improves operational efficiency and enables diagnosis to be run locally at the radiologist's computer while maintaining detection accuracy. We evaluated the evolved deep radiomic sequencer (EDRS) discovered via the proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery framework against state-of-the-art radiomics-driven and discovery radiomics methods using clinical lung CT data with pathologically-proven diagnostic data. The evolved deep radiomic sequencer shows state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy (88.78%) relative to previous radiomics approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 00:20:23 GMT  (2778kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03572v1", "8 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 20 Oct 2017 00:01:27 GMT  (1508kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03572v2", "26 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["mohammad javad shafiee", "audrey g chung", "farzad khalvati", "masoom a haider", "alexander wong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03572"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.03572.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Discovery Radiomics via Evolutionary Deep Radiomic Sequencer Discovery for Pathologically-Proven Lung Cancer Detection", "authors": ["Mohammad Javad Shafiee", "Audrey G.

Discovery Radiomics", "text": "The idea behind discovery radiomics can be described as follows (see Figure 1): Based on earlier radiological data and corresponding pathologically verified radiological tissue annotations from a medical imaging data repository, the discovery process learns a radio sequencer that can extract highly customized radiographic features (which we will call radiographic sequences) tailored to characterize unique tissue phenotypes that distinguish cancer tissues from healthy tissues.The discovered radiographic sequencer can be applied to new patient data to extract the corresponding radiographic sequence for cancer screening and diagnostic tissues.As previously discussed, one of the most important limitations of the deep radiographic sequencer proposed to date for the purpose of lung cancer detection is that both diagnostically powerful and computationally expensive and memory-intensive sequence data would require additional clinical efficiencies that would make it more difficult to deploy in the clinical cloud and allow for the transfer of high-performance clinical information19."}, {"heading": "B. Evolutionary Deep Intelligence", "text": "Before describing the proposed evolutionary deep-sequencer-deep-intelligence approach, it is first important to discuss the idea behind the evolutionary deep-intelligence. Initially introduced by Shafiee et al. [18], the general idea is to synthesize progressively more efficient deep-neural networks over several generations. Deep-neural networks evolution is modelled in a probabilistic manner, encoding the architectural features of ancestor networks through probabilistic DNA. Probabilistic DNA is used to mimic biological heritability, and new progeny networks are stochastically synthesized on the basis of this probabilistic model. To conclude the evolutionary cycle, environmental factors are applied to the model to mimic random mutations and natural selection. In each generation, the progeny network (which is more efficient than its parent) is then trained to enhance its modeling abilities and to maximize its modeling ability."}, {"heading": "C.

CT images were executed using a wide range of scanner models from different manufacturing countries applying the following peak energies: 120kV (n = 818), 130kV = 135kV (n = 69), and 140kV (n = 100)."}, {"heading": "B.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a new evolutionary Deep Radiomic Sequencer Discovery Framework to find more efficient but more powerful Radiomic Sequencers for classifying lung cancer. An evolutionary Deep Intelligence approach is integrated into the Discovery Radiomics Framework to develop the underlying deep neural network architecture of the Deep Radiomic Sequencer over several generations and to discover a more efficient and generalized Deep Radiomic Sequencer. The ultimate goal is to synthesize a new Deep Neural Network as the underlying Radiomic Sequencer with a lower number of parameters that generate more accurate radiographic sequencers that can better detect the differences between healthy and cancerous lung tissue. Results show that by developing and discovering more efficient Radiomic Sequencers, diagnostic accuracy can be developed despite the limited number of training data sequencers can better capture the differences between healthy and cancerous lung tissue."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This research was supported by the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research (OICR), Canada Research Chairs programs, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Ministry of Research and Innovation of Ontario.

"year": 2017, "abstractText": "While lung cancer is the second most diagnosed form of cancer in men and women, a sufficiently early diagnosis can be pivotal in patient survival rates. Imaging-based, or radiomics-driven, detection methods have been developed to aid diagnosticians, but largely rely on hand-crafted features which may not fully encapsulate the differences between cancerous and healthy tissue. Recently, the concept of discovery radiomics was introduced, where custom abstract features are discovered from readily available imaging data. We propose a novel evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach based on evolutionary deep intelligence. Motivated by patient privacy concerns and the idea of operational artificial intelligence, the evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach organically evolves increasingly more efficient deep radiomic sequencers that produce significantly more compact yet similarly descriptive radiomic sequences over multiple generations. As a result, this framework improves operational efficiency and enables diagnosis to be run locally at the radiologist\u2019s computer while maintaining detection accuracy. We evaluated the evolved deep radiomic sequencer (EDRS) discovered via the proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery framework against state-of-the-art radiomics-driven and discovery radiomics methods using clinical lung CT data with pathologically-proven diagnostic data. The evolved deep radiomic sequencer shows state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy (88.78%) relative to previous radiomics approaches.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
