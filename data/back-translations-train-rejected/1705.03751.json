As the size of available data continues to grow rapidly, this presents an interesting challenge as well as an opportunity for researchers in NLP. While managing such large amounts of data and distilling relevant information in a manageable form is a challenge, the large amount of available data offers an opportunity to do so. One possible way to manage such large amounts of data is to populate a database of form relationship tuples < entity2 >, extracted from text. Examples of such tuples could be capital (Delhi, India), Prime Minister (Narendra Modi, India). This simple representation is particularly useful as it allows queries to be answered directly via a given relationship and entities. To extract tuples of this form, the key objective of Relational Extraction is a particularly well-studied problem in the NLP domain, with many existing approaches."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Definition", "text": "We formally define the task of remote monitoring in the notation of (Min et al., 2013): In view of a knowledge base (KB), D, a series of relationships R, the KB D contains tuples of the form r (e1, e2), where r as well as e1 and e2 are units known to be related by the relationship r. Furthermore, we obtain a corpus, C, which contains text in natural language. The task of remote monitoring is to align the corpus C with the KB D, i.e. to automatically generate training examples for relationship extraction by making relational mentions in C with relationships in D. Formally, this requires the designation of a series of entity mentions (e1, e2) that exist in C with some r or OTHER classes as negative training examples."}, {"heading": "3 Datasets and Knowledge Bases", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Datasets", "text": "Therefore, the first model of (Craven et al., 1999) was based primarily on databases from medical sources. Subsequently, analyses were carried out on Wikipedia, NY Times Corpus and more recently on the joint tasks of 2010 and 2011 by KBP (Ji et al., 2010; Owczarzak and Dang, 2011) Some features of the data sets are: 1. Yeast Protein Database (YPD) (Hodges et al., 1999), PubMed, MEDLINE: The work of (Craven et al., 1999) primarily uses the YPD database, which contains facts about various proteins as well as links to PubMed articles supporting the fact. Furthermore, they use MEDLINE, a database of bibliographic information and abstracts for over nine million articles in the biomedical domain."}, {"heading": "3.2 Knowledge Bases", "text": "Most remote monitoring approaches usually use Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) as a KB for this task. Freebase is a publicly accessible database of semantic data. It contains relations from various sources, mainly from Wikipedia text fields. It contains about 9 million units and about 7300 relations. Some of the largest relations are shown in Table 1."}, {"heading": "4 Distant Supervision using PGMs", "text": "In this section, we will describe the various models that are proposed for remote monitoring using probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). We will begin our discussion with the simplest model based on a Naive Bayes classifier and switch to models that use more complicated PGMs."}, {"heading": "4.1 Distant Supervision in Biomedical Domain (Craven et al., 1999)", "text": "While the model itself was very simple, it was ahead of its time in many respects. As there were no large general knowledge databases available at that time, while this model was successfully used in domain-specific contexts such as genetics (Jenssen et al., 2001), it was not as if large KBs such as the Freebase were available that this technique began to become relevant.The paper considers the task of identifying subcellular localization type relationships (protein, subcellular structure) that represent the different subcellular structures in which proteins may be present to be relevant. First, the authors construct a series of instances that contain the target relationship by selecting six proteins and querying them in MEDLINE, which is a corpus of abstract biomedical journals."}, {"heading": "4.2 Distant Supervision using Freebase", "text": "(Mintz et al., 2009) This paper describes the key idea of distant supervision in a domain-independent environment and uses freebase as the basis for remote supervision. The key assumption is that when two entities participate in a relationship, a sentence that actually contains mentions of both entities should express the relationship between the two entities. However, entities are tagged with NER tools at the training stage, and when a sentence contains two entities known as an instance of a freebase relationship, traits are extracted and added to the trait of the trait that is relevant to that relationship. However, since sentences may express incorrect relationships, a multiclass logistic regression is trained to learn weights on the noisy extracted entities. At the time of testing, the pair of entities appear together with each entity's potential relationship."}, {"heading": "4.4 MultiR (Hoffmann et al., 2011)", "text": "One of the problems in the model of (Riedel et al., 2010) is that it does not allow any overlap of relationships, i.e. for each pair of entities e1 and e2, there can be no two facts r (e1, e2) and q (e1, e2). This work further loosens this assumption by constructing a graphical model, as shown in Figure 3.The other obvious change is in the conditional extraction model, which is now given by the following values: (7) P (Y = y, Z = z | x) = 1Zx \u0432r \u03a6join (yr, z) \u0445 i \u03a6extract (zi, xi), where the functions are the same as those defined above. Learning in this setting is based on approximations that lead to additive parameter updates in the style of perception (Collins, 2002). The first approximation is online learning instead of complete optimization. The second approximation is to replace expectations with maximizations, which shows a better comparison of Riedel et. (This model has been shown)."}, {"heading": "4.5 Multi-Instance Multi-Label (MIML) (Surdeanu et al., 2012)", "text": "The plate model is shown in Figure 4. The model structure is very similar to that proposed by (Hoffmann et al., 2011), but training is done through Expectation Maximization (EM). In the E-step, latent reference marks are assigned using the current model, and in the M-step, the model is retrained to maximize the log probability of the data using the current tasks. It has been observed that while this model performs better than the model proposed by (Riedel et al., 2010), it does not perform as well as (Hoffmann et al., 2011), especially in the area of extremities. However, the authors claim that this model is more stable as it yields a smoother curve."}, {"heading": "4.6 MIML-semi (Min et al., 2013)", "text": "This work builds on the work of (Surdeanu et al., 2012) and shows that due to the incomplete nature of the CBs, a significant number of negative examples are actually false negatives. They correct this problem by modelling the bag level noise caused by incomplete CBs, in addition to modelling instance level noise using the MIML model. The plate diagram is in Figure 5. The entrance to the model is a list of n bags with labels Positive (P) or Unlabelled (U) for each relationship r. The model adds another set of latent variables, l, which model the actual labels of the bag levels to combine the labels y and the MIML layers. Training is carried out using an EM algorithm similar to that proposed by (Surdeanu et al., 2012). This model achieves better performance than both labels on the MIML and the MBP data sets."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "Relation extraction is a particularly well-studied problem in the NLP area.
