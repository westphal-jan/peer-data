Mobile crowdsourcing requires an appropriate task assignment strategy, since different workers may have different performance in terms of acceptance rate and quality. Task assignment is challenging, since a worker's performance (i) may fluctuate, depending on both the worker's current context and the task context, (ii) is not known a priori, but has to be learned over time. However, learning context-specific worker performance requires access to context information, which workers may not grant to a central entity. Moreover, evaluating worker performance might require costly quality assessments. In this paper, we propose a context-aware hierarchical online learning algorithm addressing the problem of performance maximization in mobile crowdsourcing. In our algorithm, a local controller (LC) in the mobile device of a worker regularly observes its worker's context, his decisions to accept or decline tasks and the quality in completing tasks. Based on these observations, the LC regularly estimates its worker's context-specific performance. The mobile crowdsourcing platform (MCSP) then selects workers based on performance estimates received from the LCs. This hierarchical approach enables the LCs to learn context-specific worker performance and it enables the MCSP to select suitable workers. In addition, our algorithm preserves worker context locally, and it keeps the number of required quality assessments low. We prove that our algorithm converges to the optimal task assignment strategy. Moreover, the algorithm outperforms simpler task assignment strategies in experiments based on synthetic and real data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 15:34:54 GMT  (1845kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03822v1", "18 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC cs.SI", "authors": ["sabrina m\\\"uller", "cem tekin", "mihaela van der schaar", "anja klein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03822"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.03822.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Context-Aware Hierarchical Online Learning for Performance Maximization in Mobile Crowdsourcing", "authors": ["Sabrina M\u00fcller", "Cem Tekin", "Mihaela van der Schaar", "Anja Klein"], "emails": ["a.klein}@nt.tu-darmstadt.de", "cemtekin@ee.bilkent.edu.tr", "mihaela@ee.ucla.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to outdo themselves in the way they do it: in the way they do it, in the way they do it, in the way they do it, in the way they do it, in the way they do it, in the way they do it."}, {"heading": "II.

Both the willingness of an employee to accept the task and the quality can depend on the current context of the worker and the task context. Let's allow each worker to have an individual context. Xi, as each worker can allow access to an individual context dimension based on his personal settings (e.g. the worker allows access to a certain set of sensors of his mobile device that are used to derive his context).

A CONTEXT-AWARE HIERARCHICAL ONLINE LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR PERFORMANCE", "text": "The goal of the MCSP is to select for each incoming task a set of workers who maximize the sum of expected benefits for that task. In addition, they must be learned over time. As only the LCs have access to the personal context of their respective employee, coordination between the MCSP and the LCs is required. Below, we propose a hierarchical online learning method based on algorithms for the contextual multi-bandit task. [28] Our algorithms are based on the assumption that an employee's expected performance is similar in similar personal and task contexts."}, {"heading": "V. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Upper Regret Bound", "text": "The performance of HCL is evaluated by analyzing its regrets, see Eq. (2), in relation to the central oracle. (In this section, we subtract a sublinear boundary of regret, i.e., we show that R (T) = O (T) = specific regret with a certain regret < 1). Therefore, our algorithm has no loss compared to the centralized oracle, since for T \u00b2) it follows that limT \u2192 R (T) T = 0. The regret is limited to the assumption that under a similar personal context and task context, the expected performance of an employee is also similar. This assumption can be formalized as a consequence. 12Assumption 1 (assuming continuity): There exists L > 0 > 0 so that for all workers i > W and for all common contexts (x, c), (x, c)."}, {"heading": "B. Local Storage Requirements", "text": "The required local memory size in a worker's mobile device is determined by the memory size required when the LC executes Alg. 1. In Alg. 1, the worker's LC i stores the counting units Ni, q and \u03b8, q for each q-QT, i. Using the parameters from Theorem 1, the number of hypercubes to be stored in the QT partition is i (hT, i) Di = dT 1 3\u03b1 + Di eDi \u2264 2DiT Di 3\u03b1 + Di. Therefore, the number of counting units in the worker's mobile device i is limited by 2DiT Di 3\u03b1 + Di. Therefore, the required memory depends on the number of Di = Xi + C of the context dimensions. If the worker has access to a high number of Xi personal context dimensions and / or the number C of task context dimensions, the algorithm learns the context-specific performance of the worker with finer granularity, and therefore the tasks are more personalized, but the size is also required."}, {"heading": "C. Communication Requirements", "text": "The communication requirements of the HCL can be derived from its main work steps: for each task t = > first, the MCSP transmits the task context to the LCs, which is a vector of dimension C (or, in other words, C scalars); then the LCs of the available workers estimate the performance of their employee and send it to the MCSP, corresponding to the Wt scalars to be transmitted (a scalar sent by each LC of an available worker); finally, the MCSP informs the selected workers of their decision, which corresponds to the mt scalars sent by the MCSP. Therefore, for the task t, in sum, Wt \u00b7 (C + 1) + mt scalars will have to be transmitted, of which Wt \u00b7 C + mt scalars will be transmitted by the MCSP and a scalar by the MCSP."}, {"heading": "D. Worker Quality Assessment Requirements", "text": "As mentioned above, monitoring the quality of an employee may be costly, as it may require either a quality assessment by the client or an automatic quality assessment using local software on the battery-powered mobile device. HCL takes this into account explicitly by requesting only a quality assessment when selecting an employee for exploration purposes. At this point, we specify an upper limit for the number of Ai (T) quality assessments per worker up to task T. Episode 2 (linked to the number of quality assessments up to task T): Given the fact that Assumption 1 applies when LC i, i-W, Alg. 1 with the parameters Ki (t) = t 2\u03b1 + Di log (t), t = 1,..., T and hT, i = dT 13\u03b1 + Di e, and the MCSP Alg. 2 performs, the number Ai (T) of quality assessments of each worker up to task T is considered the upper limit of Ai (T)."}, {"heading": "VI.

Based on a linear reward function based on contexts and the history of previous observations of context-specific work performance, the algorithm selects the available workers with the highest estimated upper limit of their expected performance. The algorithm has an input parameter that limits the influence of trust. LinUCB is used in [20] for task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing. \u2022 AUTHER: This algorithm [31] is an extension of the well-known UCB algorithm [32] on the sleeping arm."}, {"heading": "B. Evaluation Metrics", "text": "Each algorithm runs through a sequence of tasks t = 1,..., T and its result is evaluated on the basis of the following indicators. Depending on the incoming tasks, we calculate the total performance up to t, which is achieved by an algorithm, which is the cumulative sum of the performance of all selected workers up to (and including) the task. Formally, if the group of selected workers of an algorithm A is for task t {sAt, j} j = 1,..., min {mt, Wt} and psAt, j (t) is the observed performance of the worker s A t, j, the total performance up to t, which is achieved by algorithm A, automatically t = 1 min {mt, Wt,..., j (t). In addition, we calculate the average work performance up to t, which is achieved by an algorithm, which is the average performance of all selected workers up to task t. Formally, the average work performance up to t is defined, j (t), j (t) t = 1 m, Wt."}, {"heading": "C. Simulation Setup", "text": "The difference between the two approaches lies in the arrival process of the workers and their contexts. To generate produe11synthetic data, we generate workers and their contexts based on some predefined distributions as described below. In the case of real data similar to, for example, [6], [20], we use a data set from Gowalla [33]. Gowalla is a location-based social network where users share their location by checking certain locations in their surroundings. We use the check-ins to simulate the arrival process of the workers and their contexts. Gowalla data sets are of 6,442,892 different users over the period from February 2009 to October 2010. Each entry of the data set consists of the form (User ID, Check-in Time, Latitude). Similar to the approach in [22] we use New York City Extract."}, {"heading": "D. Parameter Selection", "text": "HCL, LinUCB, AUER and -Greedy require a parameter as input that influences their performance. In order to find suitable parameters, we create 20 synthetic instances, each consisting of a sequence of T = 10,000 tasks and workers, which are scanned according to the procedure described above. Then, we run HCL, LinUCB, AUER and -Greedy with different parameters. Note that we set \u03b1 = 1 for HCL, hT, i = dT 1 3 + Di e, i = 1,..., W as in Theorem 1, and set the control function to Ki (t) = ft 2\u03b13\u03b1 + Di log (t), t = 1,..., T, including the factor f (0, 1] to reduce the number of exploration phases. Then, we search for suitable f. Table II shows the parameters where each of the algorithms works best."}, {"heading": "E. Results", "text": "Then we trace the algorithms back to the parameters in Table II, to the 100 synthetic instances, to the 100 synthetic instances, and to the 100 synthetic instances, each based on real data. Figure 4 (a) and Figure 4 (b) show the cumulative performance up to task t as a function of sequentially incoming tasks t = 1,..., T, for synthetic and real data. The cumulative performance achieved by each algorithm increases linearly to increase the number of tasks processed for both synthetic and real data. As expected, while Oracle outperforms all other algorithms due to its a priori knowledge of the expected performance of the workers, Random sets a lower limit for achievable performance."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we introduced a contextual hierarchical online learning algorithm that determines employee acceptance and quality online over time to maximize performance in a mobile crowdsourcing system for location-based tasks. Our algorithm is split into two parts, one performed by local controllers in workers \"mobile devices, the other by the mobile crowdsourcing platform. While local controllers learn the acceptance and quality of their 14 employees, the mobile crowdsourcing platform assigns tasks to employees based on the regular exchange of information with local controllers. Our hierarchical approach ensures that the most suitable employees are requested by the mobile crowdsourcing platform. Learning in local controllers ensures that the personal work context can be maintained locally, but that workers are still offered the tasks they may be interested in. We showed that the requirements of our algorithm in terms of communication, the number of tasks and the optimal algorithms are matched to the number of tasks and the small number of tasks."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "The work of Sabrina Mu \u00bc ller and Anja Klein was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) as part of Research Project B3 in the Collaborative Research Centre 1053 - MAKI.

(Also, we leave the selected workers in the selection phase, for which the MCSP is in the exploitation phase, and the selected workers in the selection phase, for which the MCSP is in the exploration phase. (T) In view of this, the tasks are more random, which depend on the choices of the MCSP and the randomness of the observed achievements.

Mobile crowdsourcing requires an appropriate task assignment strategy, since different workers may have different performance in terms of acceptance rate and quality. Task assignment is challenging, since a worker\u2019s performance (i) may fluctuate, depending on both the worker\u2019s current context and the task context, (ii) is not known a priori, but has to be learned over time. However, learning context-specific worker performance requires access to context information, which workers may not grant to a central entity. Moreover, evaluating worker performance might require costly quality assessments. In this paper, we propose a context-aware hierarchical online learning algorithm addressing the problem of performance maximization in mobile crowdsourcing. In our algorithm, a local controller (LC) in the mobile device of a worker regularly observes its worker\u2019s context, his decisions to accept or decline tasks and the quality in completing tasks. Based on these observations, the LC regularly estimates its worker\u2019s context-specific performance. The mobile crowdsourcing platform (MCSP) then selects workers based on performance estimates received from the LCs. This hierarchical approach enables the LCs to learn context-specific worker performance and it enables the MCSP to select suitable workers. In addition, our algorithm preserves worker context locally, and it keeps the number of required quality assessments low. We prove that our algorithm converges to the optimal task assignment strategy. Moreover, the algorithm outperforms simpler task assignment strategies in experiments based on synthetic and real data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
