INTRODUCTIONIn recent years, the explosion of the mobile network in Vietnam has stimulated the use of short message service (SMS). Spam through SMS has increased because the cost of the spammer is low and the response rate is higher than email. SMS spam is a serious problem in Vietnam due to the availability of unlimited and very cheap prepaid SMS packages. According to a 2015 report by BKAV1, an information security company, there were 13.9 million spam messages sent to mobile phone users every day in Vietnam, and one in two people received spam messages [1]. Meanwhile, there were at least 120 million active mobile users on the market according to a report by the Ministry of Information and Communications published in 2015. Spam SMS causes many problems for mobile users. They may suffer financial losses due to the reaction to these messages."}, {"heading": "II. BACKGROUND", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Spam filtering system", "text": "A text message is a short text message that contains only a limited number of characters. The structure of this message is divided into the header and the body. The header contains some information about the subject, sender and recipient, while the body represents the actual content of the message we see on mobile phones. Figure 1 shows the pipeline of a common spam filter. The processing chain of a filter can be divided into three components. The first is preprocessing, in which documents are processed to extract data for later use. The common preprocessing steps are tokenization, lemmatization and removal of stopwords. After preprocessing, the raw text is converted into vectors, each representing the contents of a message. The most popular representations are word bags and frequency inversion of documents. The vectors are inputs into a machine learning model. After training, the model is able to mark each new message as spam or not."}, {"heading": "B. Spam filtering system for Vietnamese", "text": "Most of these systems are designed for filtering spam e-mails [7], [8]. The best accuracy of these systems is about 92%, but the false positive rate is not feasible in practical applications, about 6% [7]. Moreover, e-mail has many properties other than SMS, so applying these systems directly to our task cannot provide the best accuracy. For these reasons, we propose a system that focuses on filtering Vietnamese spam SMS."}, {"heading": "III. METHODOLOGY", "text": "SMS has some features other than normal text such as e-mail, the task of tagging spam SMS is more difficult than with e-mail. First, the maximum length of an SMS is only 160 characters, so the content-based approach to SMS is more difficult because there is less information. Second, participants do not usually use normal grammar to type a message. They use abbreviations, phonetic contractions, incorrect punctuation, emoticons, etc. This makes the data sparse and some pre-processing tools cannot be used. In addition, the linguistic characteristics of the Vietnamese language are different from Western languages. Therefore, the direct application of methods for English or the use of existing systems to detect Vietnamese spam e-mails may not provide the best performance. In the following sections, we present our main method, including pre-processing step, features and machine learning models."}, {"heading": "A.

Classifiers", "text": "1) Baseline Classifier: Spam messages from mobile network operators are easy to detect because they have special tags in their contents. Therefore, we collect these tags and tag messages they have as spam messages. Specifically, these tags are [QC *], (QC *), [TB *], (TB *), where * is a string or empty. We use this method as the base system for the evaluation task. 2) Machine Learning Models: We have trained some common machine learning models on our data set and used them to detect spam messages. These models include Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT) and k-next neighbour (kNN)."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENT", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Dataset", "text": "We are conducting experiments with a dataset containing 6599 messages manually annotated with labels. Our dataset is a collection of messages from two largest mobile operators in Vietnam - Viettel and Vinaphone. In this dataset there are 5557 legitimate messages and 1042 spam messages. His dictionary contains 7,334 unique words. Spam messages can be sent either from mobile operators or other sources. The former are easy to detect because they have special tags in their contents. In our dataset, about 70% of spam messages come from operators. The size of this corpus is comparable to some SMS datasets in English [4]. This dataset is provided for research.2"}, {"heading": "B. Results and Discussions", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to establish itself at the top, in the same way as it has done in previous years."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK", "text": "In this article, we have introduced the first Vietnamese spam SMS filtering system. Our system achieves a good accuracy of about 94% of the detection of spam messages. This result is comparable to the accuracy of this task in English and exceeds the performance of some Vietnamese spam identification systems, although the classification of SMS is more complicated. In the future, on the one hand, we plan to improve our system by enlarging our corpus to provide more data to the system. On the other hand, we would like to use some deep learning models such as a neural folding network and a long-term memory to detect spam messages, as these models have been proven to provide the best performance for many text classification problems [12], [13]."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors thank the CyRadar3 team for providing the data set for use in the experiments.
