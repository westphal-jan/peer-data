It is an important step towards understanding the meaning of a natural language. There exists SRL systems for well-studied languages like English, Chinese or Japanese but there is not any such system for the Vietnamese language. In this paper, we present the first SRL system for Vietnamese with encouraging accuracy. We first demonstrate that a simple application of SRL techniques developed for English could not give a good accuracy for Vietnamese. We then introduce a new algorithm for extracting candidate syntactic constituents, which is much more accurate than the common node-mapping algorithm usually used in the identification step. Finally, in the classification step, in addition to the common linguistic features, we propose novel and useful features for use in SRL. Our SRL system achieves an $F_1$ score of 73.53\\% on the Vietnamese PropBank corpus.

This is a difficult problem because the number of constituent candidates is exponentially high, especially for long sentences. The second step is argument classification, which determines the exact semantic role of each constituent candidate identified in the first task. For example, the identification step of the sentence in the previous example Nam gi\u00fap Huy h\u0430c b\u00e0i v\u00e0o h\u00f4m qua is described in Figure 3, and in the classification task semantic roles are referred to as Figure 2."}, {"heading": "B. Existing Corpora for SRL", "text": "1) FrameNet: The FrameNet project is a lexical database of English. It was built by annotating examples of how words are in actual texts. It consists of more than 10,000 words, most of them with annotated examples showing the meaning and use and more than 170,000 manually annotated sentences [10]. This is the most widely used dataset on which SRL systems for English have been developed and tested. FrameNet is based on the Frame Semantics theory [11]. The basic idea is that the meanings of most words can best be understood on the basis of a semantic framework: a description of some kind of event, relationship or unit and the participants in it. All members in semantic frames are called Frame Semantics Elements. For example, a sentence in FrameNet is commented in cooking concept as shown in Figure 4.2."}, {"heading": "III. METHODOLOGY", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Existing Approaches", "text": "This section summarizes existing approaches used by typical SRL systems for well-studied languages. We describe these systems by examining two aspects, namely the data type that the systems use and their strategies for labeling semantic roles, including model types, labeling strategies, and degree of granularity. 1) Data types: There are some types of data that are used in the formation of SRL systems. Some systems use bracketed trees as input data. A bracketed tree of a sentence is the tree of nested constituencies that represents its constituency structure. Some systems use dependency trees of a sentence that represent dependency trees between individual words of a sentence. Syntactic dependence represents the fact that the presence of a sentence is licensed by another word that is its governor. In a typed dependency analysis, grammatical designations are added to the dependency systems in order to show their subgrammatical relationships (for example, the subgrammatical tree or nominal objects)."}, {"heading": "B.

EXPERIMENT", "text": "In this section, we first present the Vietnamese PropBank, where our SRL system was trained and tested, and then propose two applicable feature sets. Finally, we present and discuss experimental results."}, {"heading": "A. Dataset", "text": "We are conducting experiments with the Vietnamese PropBank [18], which contains about 5,460 sentences manually provided with semantic roles. This corpus has a similar annotation scheme as the English PropBank. Due to some inconsistency annotation errors of the corpus, especially in many complex sentences, we could not use the entire corpus in our experiments. We are focusing on simple sentences that have only one predicate, rather than complex sentences with multiple predicates. After extracting sentences, we have a corpus of about 4,860 simple sentences commented with semantic roles. The semantic roles covered by the Vietnamese PropBank are the following: \u2022 Core Arguments (Arg0-Arg4): Arguments define specific roles. These core arguments are similar to those of the English PropBank, but there are 5 roles instead of 7 compared with the English PropBank. \u2022 Adjunct Arguments (ArgM-): There are 20 types of Adjat (There is an Adjat I)."}, {"heading": "B. Feature Sets", "text": "We use two features in this study. The first consists of basic features commonly used in the SFL system for English. These features are used in the SFL system of Gildea and Jurafsky on the FrameNet corpus. [5].1) Basic features Set: These features consist of 6 feature templates as follows: 1) Phrase type: This is a very useful feature in the classification of semantic roles because different roles tend to have different syntactic categories. For example, in the sentence in Figure 8 B\u00e0 n\u00f3i n\u00f3 l\u00e0 con trai t\u00f4i m\u00e0, the phrase type of the constituent n\u00f3 is NP. 2) Parse Tree Path: This function captures the syntactic relationship between a constituent and a predicate in a coupled tree. This is the shortest path from a constituent node to a constituent node."}, {"heading": "C. Results and Discussions", "text": "1) Evaluation method: We use a 10-fold cross-validation method to evaluate our system; this method is only 29.53%. The final accuracy of the results is the average hit rate of the 10 runs. The evaluation yardsticks are precision, recall, and the F1 measure. Precision (P) is the percentage of arguments identified by the system that are correct; the callback (R) is the percentage of designated arguments in the gold analysis that are correctly identified by the system; and the F1 measurement is the harmonic mean of P and R, which is F1 = 2PR / (P + R).2) Baseline system: In the first experiment, we compare our constituent arguments with the 1-1-1-1 node mapping algorithms. Table II shows the performance of two extraction algorithms. We see that our extraction algorithms significantly exceed the 1-1-1-node mapping algorithms, both in precision and in recall."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our system achieves a good accuracy of about 73.5% of the F1 score in Vietnam's PropBank. We have argued that it is not possible to assume good applicability of existing methods and tools developed for English and other Western languages, and that they may not offer cross-linguistic validity. For an isolating language like Vietnamese, techniques developed for inflexible languages cannot be applied as they are. \"In particular, we have developed an algorithm for extracting argumentation candidates that has a better accuracy than the 1-1-node mapping algorithm. We have proposed some novel features that prove useful for the Vietnamese SRL, particularly the prediction of clusters and function labels. Our SRL system, including software and corpus, is available as an open source project for free research purposes, and we believe that it is a good basis for developing and comparing future data as we plan to further improve our Vietnamese SRL system by adding various SR23 models to it."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work was supported by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED Project No. 102.05-2014.28) and we would also like to thank the FPT Technology Research Institute for providing the corpora for the experiments."}], "references": [{"title": "Using semantic roles to improve question answering", "author": ["D.
