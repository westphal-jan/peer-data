As useful models for a variety of practical applications, these problems are computational challenging. In this paper, we study the classic critical node problem (CNP) and introduce an effective memetic algorithm for solving CNP. The proposed algorithm combines a double backbone-based crossover operator (to generate promising offspring solutions), a component-based neighborhood search procedure (to find high-quality local optima) and a rank-based pool updating strategy (to guarantee a healthy population). Specially, the component-based neighborhood search integrates two key techniques, i.e., two-phase node exchange strategy and node weighting scheme. The double backbone-based crossover extends the idea of general backbone-based crossovers. Extensive evaluations on 42 synthetic and real-world benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm discovers 21 new upper bounds and matches 18 previous best-known upper bounds. We also demonstrate the relevance of our algorithm for effectively solving a variant of the classic CNP, called the cardinality-constrained critical node problem.

THE PROPOSED MEMETIC APPROACH FOR CNP", "text": "In this section, we introduce MACNP, an effective memetic algorithm for solving the classic problem of the critical node. The memetic framework is a powerful general method that has been successfully used to solve many NP-hard problems, such as chart coloring [31], graph partition [7], maximum diversity [46], [49] and square knapsack [13].

Therefore, the entire solution space contains all possible subsets S V, so that | S | 6 K. According to Equation (1), the corresponding objective function value f (S) for a viable solution calculates the total number of node pairs still connected in the residual graph G [V\\ S]. f (S) can be calculated using a modified depth search algorithm by identifying the connected components of a graph [26]."}, {"heading": "B.

For each generation, a progeny solution is generated through the double backbone-based crossover procedure (Section III-E.

Rank-based pool updating", "text": "Each progeny solution is presented for improvement by the component-based neighborhood search method set forth in Section III-D.

First, we temporarily insert S0 into the population P (line 3 of Alg.3), then we estimate all individuals in the population according to the score function [49] (line 4-8 of Alg.3), and identify the worst solution Sw with the highest score Sw-9 (finally, Sw-3)."}, {"heading": "G. Computational complexity of MACNP", "text": "To analyze the computational complexity of the proposed MACNP algorithm, we consider the most important steps in a generation in the main loop of algorithm 1.

Parent selection is very simple and takes time O (1). The double backbone-based crossover operator can be realized in time O (| V | K2). The computational complexity of the component-based neighborhood search is O (K (| V | + | E |) MaxIter, where MaxIter is the maximum allowable number of iterations without improvement.

CC-CNP aims to identify a minimum subset S V so that each connected component in the residual diagram G [V\\ S] contains at most W nodes where W is a given threshold. To approximate K \u0445, we solve a series of CC-CNP with decreasing K > K values. For a fixed K, we try to find a fixed S V of K-nodes whose distance minimizes the number of nodes in each connected component that exceeds the cardinality threshold W. To this end, we define an auxiliary function (minimization function) f \u2032: f \u2032 (S) = T \u0445 i = 1max (| Ci | \u2212 W, 0) (2), which calculates the total number of nodes via W in all T-connected components of the residual diagram.

Solving CC-CNP with MACNP", "text": "To solve CC-CNP, we slightly adjust MACNP and designate the new algorithm by MACC-CNP. In essence, we replace the objective function f used in MACNP with the minimization function f \u2032, which is defined by Equation (2). To solve CC-CNP, we start with an initial K value (obtained with a construction method, see below) and apply MACC-CNP to find a set of K-nodes whose removal minimizes the number of excess 9 nodes (i.e., the minimization of f \u2032 (S) = 0). If f \u2032 (S) = 0, then S is a feasible solution of CC-CNP. At this moment, we reduce K by one and solve the problem again. We repeat this process until no feasible solution can be found and report the last S found with f \u2032 (S) = 0. This general solution method is achieved by a popular approach to the classical gradient v = 0, which is inspired by a large scale problem [47]."}, {"heading": "C.

Effectiveness of the node weighting scheme", "text": "To evaluate the effectiveness of the node weight scheme in component-based neighborhood search (CBNS), we compared our MACNP algorithm with its alternative MACNP1 algorithm, where the node weight scheme is disabled in CBNS. In MACNP1, we also split the exchange process into two phases (\"Add Phase\" and \"Removal Phase\") and execute them separately. However, in \"Add Phase,\" a node is randomly removed from a large connected component, rather than selecting the node according to the node weight scheme. Table VII shows the comparison results of MACNP and MACNP1 on the tested instances, based on four indicators: best objective value (fbest), average objective value (favg), average time to find the best objective value (tavg), average number of favorable steps required to find the CNMAMA1, average number of CNMAP value (CNMA1) less than CNMA1, where an objective value (CNMAMA1) is CNMA1, and average number of favorable steps is required to find the favorable one (table)."}, {"heading": "C. Rationale behind the double backbone-based crossover", "text": "To investigate the reasons for this turnout, we compare MACNP with an alternative version of MACNP2. MACNP2 is obtained by MACNP by replacing our backbone-based dedicated turnout with a single backbone-based turnout that only treats the common elements as the backbone. Specifically, the single backbone-based turnout operator first constructs a partial S0 solution by directly inheriting all the common elements of two parent solutions, and then completes the partial solution S0 by removing a node from a large component of the residual diagram up to | S0 | = K. The comparative performance of MACNP and its alternative MACNP2 in terms of the best lens value and average lens value are shown in the left and right part of Figure 1. X-axis shows instance V, and Yaxis shows the gap between our results (eight best values or averages) and the average lens value IV."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we proposed an effective memetic search approach to solving the classical critical node problem (MACNP), which combines a component-based neighborhood search for local optimization, a two-phase crossover operator for recombining solutions, and a rank-based pool update strategy to ensure healthy population diversity. In addition, to ensure its effectiveness, the two-phase crossover solution not only maintains solution characteristics of parent solutions, but also introduces diversity by likely incorporating exclusive elements from parent solutions. To demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm, we evaluated MACNP based on a wide range of synthetic and real benchmarks. The computational results showed that MACNP is clearly superior to state-of-the-art technology."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We thank Dr. W.

"Critical node problems involve identifying a subset of critical nodes from an undirected graph whose removal results in optimizing a pre-defined measure over the residual graph. As useful models for a variety of practical applications, these problems are computational challenging. In this paper, we study the classic critical node problem (CNP) and introduce an effective memetic algorithm for solving CNP. The proposed algorithm combines a double backbone-based crossover operator (to generate promising offspring solutions), a component-based neighborhood search procedure (to find high-quality local optima) and a rank-based pool updating strategy (to guarantee a healthy population). Specially, the component-based neighborhood search integrates two key techniques, i.e., two-phase node exchange strategy and node weighting scheme. The double backbone-based crossover extends the idea of general backbonebased crossovers. Extensive evaluations on 42 synthetic and realworld benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm discovers 21 new upper bounds and matches 18 previous bestknown upper bounds. We also demonstrate the relevance of our algorithm for effectively solving a variant of the classic CNP, called the cardinality-constrained critical node problem. Finally, we investigate the usefulness of each key algorithmic component.", "creator": "gnuplot 4.6 patchlevel 4"}}}
