We first look at the abstract arithmetic problem underlying curiosity, and then formally deduce an optimal solution to this problem. computer problem underlying curiosity Suppose an agent is in an environment with n stimuli, each of which offers a reward if the appropriate response occurs. The agent's goal is to decide what needs to be explored in the environment in order to maximize his knowledge and thereby maximize the rewards in the future. ck denotes the probability that each stimulus occurs in the environment. pk is the \"need probability\" that a stimulus k will occur in the future (Anderson, 1990). In view of this, the agent assigns a trustworthiness to each stimulus in the environment. ck denotes the probability that the agent knows the correct response to the kest stimulus. This probability increases with decreasing probability in relation to the number of exposures with that stimulus."}, {"heading": "Deriving an optimal solution", "text": "In order to solve the problem of which stimulus to further explore, the agent can evaluate the change in V while researching each stimulus in the environment. Therefore, for each stimulus k in the environment, the agent should calculate the change in knowledge that would result from researching this stimulus. (3) The stimulus that causes the greatest increase in the total value should be investigated first. This calculation can be made simply by differentiating V in relation to hk, dV dhk = pk. dhk. (3) An agent working according to this model will investigate stimuli that exhibit a high rate of value variation. this rate of change, i.e. dVdhk, is simply the curiosity that the agent has in order to know the kest element that is known as \"k.\" The agent will explore stimuli in the environment that he is most curious about.

Models of curiosity have previously explained human curiosity by linking it to various psychological factors such as novelty, information gap and learning progress. We have shown that these different models are all special cases of curiosity - depending on the environment, curiosity can be driven by each of these factors. In addition to the possibility of unifying earlier unambiguous mechanistic explanations of curiosity, our rational model explains human curiosity in different situations. Our results suggest that human curiosity is not only sensitive to the properties of stimuli, but is also influenced by the nature of the environment. When people are in an environment in which exposure is likely to be influenced, their curiosity is highest for stimuli of which they are moderately confident. On the other hand, when necessity is probability and exposure independent, then curiosity is highest for novel stimuli, i.e. stimuli in which people have little confidence."}], "references": [{"title": "The adaptive character of thought", "author": ["J.R.
