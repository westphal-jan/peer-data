We represent this stack with a permutation of size N, where entry i refers to the i-th smallest pancake and the order of the numbers in the permutation corresponds to the order of the pancakes in the stack from top to bottom. < 2, 1, 4, 3 >, for example, represents a 4 pancake stack in which the second smallest pancake is located at the top of the stack. In each N pancake state, there are N \u2212 1 applicable actions or movements, designated by M2, M3,..., MN. The action Mk, designated as k-Flip, reverses the order of the first k values in the stack. Where Mk (\u03c0) denotes the permutation that is the result of applying the action Mk to \u03c0, this means that Mk (\u03c0-Flip) [1] in the first stack mutates the order of the first stack."}, {"heading": "1.3 The Gap Heuristic", "text": "A heuristic function h is a function from the group of states to the group of non-negative real numbers, where h (\u03c0) is referred to as the heuristic value of \u03c0. A heuristic h is considered admissible if for each state \u03c0, h (\u03c0) \u2264 h \u0445 (\u03c0).The heuristic gap (Helmert 2010), which we call hG, is, however, most simply defined formally by the extended permutation \u03c0e. \u03c0e is defined as a gap < N + 1 >. The value N + 1 can be considered the plate under the pancake pile, although we often refer to it as the N + 1 st gap.

We start by showing that there is at least one gap in each non-target state. Lemma 2.1. \u03c0 is a target state, if and only if hG (\u03c0) = 0.Evidence. The fact that if \u03c0 is a target state, then there is no gap between the places N \u2212 1 and N of the others. Therefore, we assume that hG (\u03c0) = 0 are places that are not closed. \u2212 This argument can be extended to show that for each place N \u2264 i \u2264 N = i. [i] = i.

To simplify this analysis, we assume that in all states there is a gap between the sites N and N + 1. Thus, the postfix of a state is cancelled if it is already sorted, since this part of the state will have no effect on the number of gaps or the optimal solution costs. So we start with an additional notation. Following Hoffmann (2005), a plateau for h is a contiguous set of one or more states, all of which have the same heuristic value. An exit from a plateau with heuristic value is a state."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have provided the complete evidence underlying a characterization of the topology of gap heuristics.
