However, a theory may represent knowledge that is subject to change, as a result of executing actions that have effects on some of the initial properties mentioned in the theory. Having once computed a decomposition of a theory, it is advantageous to know whether a decomposition has to be computed again in the newly-changed theory (obtained from taking into account changes resulting from execution of an action). In the paper, we address this problem in the scope of the situation calculus, where a change of an initial theory is related to the notion of progression. Progression provides a form of forward reasoning; it relies on forgetting values of those properties, which are subject to change, and computing new values for them. We consider decomposability and inseparability, two component properties known from the literature, and contribute by 1) studying the conditions when these properties are preserved and 2) when they are lost wrt progression and the related operation of forgetting. To show the latter, we demonstrate the boundaries using a number of negative examples. To show the former, we identify cases when these properties are preserved under forgetting and progression of initial theories in local-effect basic action theories of the situation calculus. Our paper contributes to bridging two different communities in Knowledge Representation, namely research on modularity and research on reasoning about actions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 May 2017 18:36:21 GMT  (56kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04712v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["denis ponomaryov", "mikhail soutchanski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.04712"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.04712.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Progression of Decomposed Local-Effect Action Theories", "authors": ["Denis Ponomaryov", "Mikhail Soutchanski"], "emails": ["ponom@iis.nsk.su,", "mes@scs.ryerson.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 5.04 712v 1 [cs.A I] 1 2M ay"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is not the case that we are able to behave in a different way, as we have done in the past.

If M1 and M2 are two multi-sorted structures and \u2206 is a signature, then we say that M1 and M2 are in agreement if they have the same domains and the same interpretation of each symbol for each type. If M is a structure and \u03c3 is a subset of predicate and function symbols of M, then we refer to the reduction of M towards a signature, i.e., the structure with predicates and function names of n is that each symbol is of the same entity as in M.

Some approaches follow the idea that a module should be a syntactical subset of the axioms of a given theory. [2] However, a theory can be divided into subsets of axioms that meet certain requirements of equilibrium between partitions. [3] As a rule, the information to be communicated refers to the signatures that are shared between partitions. The advantage of this approach is that the signature can be relatively simple and relies on syntactical analysis of theory axioms."}, {"heading": "P and its complement.

Although we focus on forgetting basic atoms, the counterpart results for forgetting are often free and are therefore included in this section. Furthermore, they help to see the difference between the two types of forgetting, which contributes to a better understanding of this operation.

However, in the case of progression, we cannot limit ourselves to working only with initial theories; we must therefore also implicitly consider information from subsequent state axioms. The aim of this section is to examine component properties of progression that do not contain different forms of progression. We continue to use the following notations in our work. For a ground action term in the language of situation calculation, we call the situation we define by the term progression. To define progression, we introduce an equivalence relationship to many sorted structures in the situation signature. For two structural resM, M \"and a ground action method, we use M,\" when defining the progression, we introduce an equivalence relationship to many sorted structures in the situation signature."}, {"heading": "5 Summary and Future Work", "text": "We have identified the effects of theory updating in our studies, such as forgetting and progression, on the preservation of the component properties of theories, such as the decomposition and inseparability of terms that have a \"semantic nature,\" and the results of these transformations may be indistinguishable by applying constraints to the classes of models. On the contrary, the decomposibility and inseparability of properties is potentially immense, which can be bridged by the choice of appropriate logic or theories in input theory. We have identified conditions that should be imposed on the components of input theories in order to more closely correspond to these concepts, and the parallel interpolation of property (PIP) has also been demonstrated to be a relevant property of logic in our investigations."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgements", "text": "The first author was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre SFB / TRR 62 \"Companion-Technology for Cognitive Technical Systems,\" the Russian Ministry of Science and Education as part of the 5-100 Excellence Programme and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Project No. 15-07-03410A.

a number of weakly-related or independent components. However, a theory may represent knowledge that is subject to change, as a result of executing actions that have effects on some of the initial properties mentioned in the theory. Having once computed a decomposition of a theory, it is advantageous to know whether a decomposition has to be computed again in the newly-changed theory (obtained from taking into account changes resulting from execution of an action). In the paper, we address this problem in the scope of the situation calculus, where a change of an initial theory is related to the notion of progression. Progression provides a form of forward reasoning; it relies on forgetting values of those properties, which are subject to change, and computing new values for them. We consider decomposability and inseparability, two component properties known from the literature, and contribute by 1) studying the conditions when these properties are preserved and 2) when they are lost wrt progression and the related operation of forgetting. To show the latter, we demonstrate the boundaries using a number of negative examples. To show the former, we identify cases when these properties are preserved under forgetting and progression of initial theories in local-effect basic action theories of the situation calculus. Our paper contributes to bridging two different communities in Knowledge Representation, namely research on modularity and research on reasoning about actions.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.996 Copyright 2016 Radical Eye Software"}}}
