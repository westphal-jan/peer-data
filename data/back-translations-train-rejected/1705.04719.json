For example, an Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Repository [Smith et al., 2007] comprises more than eighty specialized ontologies on topics as diverse as molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components. Ontology integration aims in particular to organize information across different domains in a modular manner so that information from one ontology can be reused in other ontologies. For example, the ontology of diseases can describe anatomical structures to describe the location of diseases, or genes with which diseases are corrected.Integration of multiple ontologies in OWL: an OWL ontology can refer to one or more other otologies."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Most existing approaches (e.g. an overview of the possibilities of interpretation within the sphere of interpretation) are designed to enable the propagation of subjects (e.g. concepts, roles) by making interpretations of interpretations that show links between ontology and subjectivism.

We also consider DLsH and P, which are the role-free fragments of EL and ALC, respectively. Consequently, P corresponds to classical statement logic, and H to the horn fragment. The semantics of DLs are given by (primary) interpretations. An interpretation I = <, \u00b7 I > consists of a non-empty signature of I, the interpretation function of I, and an interpretation function \u00b7 I that assigns a subset of AI to each A-NC model."}, {"heading": "4 Semantic Importing", "text": "In this case, we say that O1 imports a model that satisfies an import relationship, if there is a model that gives an import relationship, if there is a model that gives an import relationship, if there is a model that gives an import relationship, if there is a model that gives an import relationship, if there is a model that gives an import relationship, if there is an import relationship, if there is a model that gives an import relationship, if there is a model that exists like this."}, {"heading": "5 Expresiveness of Ontology Networks", "text": "(1).

In order to import an external ontology O into a local one, one must define an import relationship that defines a set of symbols whose semantics should be borrowed from O. The significant feature of the proposed mechanism, which is natural in complex ontological integration scenarios, is that each ontology has its own view of ontologies, which it refines and views of the same ontology are independent unless they are coordinated by import relationships. We have shown that this feature can lead to an exponential increase in the temporal complexity of the argument about ontologies combined with acyclic import relations. Intuitively, this is the reason why one must look at several views of the same ontology, each of which has a different ontology."}], "references": [{"title": "In Modular Ontologies", "author": ["Jie Bao", "George Voutsadakis", "Giora Slutzki", "Vasant Honavar.
