Here we investigate whether the presence of an inner-eye-like process (monitor) that supervises the activities of a number of subsystems (operative agents) engaged in the solution of a problem can improve the problem-solving efficiency of the system. The problem is to find the global maximum of a NK fitness landscape and the performance is measured by the time required to find that maximum. The operative agents explore blindly the fitness landscape and the monitor provides them with feedback on the quality (fitness) of the proposed solutions. This feedback is then used by the operative agents to bias their searches towards the fittest regions of the landscape. We find that a weak feedback between the monitor and the operative agents improves the performance of the system, regardless of the difficulty of the problem, which is gauged by the number of local maxima in the landscape. For easy problems (i.e., landscapes without local maxima), the performance improves monotonically as the feedback strength increases, but for difficult problems, there is an optimal value of the feedback strength beyond which the system performance degrades very rapidly.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 May 2017 20:40:24 GMT  (27kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04885v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jos\\'e f fontanari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.04885"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.04885.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Awareness improves problem-solving performance", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 F.

Here, we investigate whether the presence of an in-eye process (monitor) that monitors the activities of a number of subsystems (operational agents) that participate in solving a problem that can improve the problem-solving efficiency of the system. The problem is that the global maximum is the maximum of a NK fitness landscape and performance measured against the time it takes to find this maximum. Operative agents blindly identify the fitness landscape and monitor the quality of the solutions proposed."}, {"heading": "II. TASK", "text": "The task facing a system of L-agents is to find the unique global maximum of a fitness landscape generated with the NK model = > landscape (12). For our purposes, the advantage of using the NK model is that it allows the coordination of the ruggedness of the landscape - and thus the difficulty of the task - by defining the integer parameters N and K. Specifically, the NK landscape is defined in the space of binary strings x = (x1), which is an average of the contributions of the individual elements i of the string, i.e., the parameters N determine the size of the state space given by 2N. For each bit string x, a unique real fitness value is assigned (x), which is an average of the contributions i = each element of the string, i.e. we (x) = 1N (x), in which we determine the contribution of the element i to the fitness of the string x."}, {"heading": "III. MODEL", "text": "Once the task is determined, we can decide on the best representation for the operative agents who will explore the state space of the problem. Clearly, an appropriate representation for the search NK landscapes is to represent these agents as binary strings, and so we will henceforth use the terms agent and string interchangeably. Agents are organized on a star topology and can only interact with a central agent - the monitor - who does not seek the state space, but simply displays the best functioning string at a given moment. Figure 1 illustrates the topology of the communication network used in the commercial experiments. L peripheral strings are randomly initialized with equal probability for bits 0 and the central nodes produced in this random setup. The search begins with the selection of one of the peripheral agents at random - the target agents. This agent can choose between two different processes to move into the state space."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "As a measure of the performance of the system in the search for the global maximum of NK landscapes, we look at the mean computing costs < C >, which are achieved by averaging the computing costs over 105 different types of landscapes, and the result is then averaged over 100 different landscapes."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "Theories of consciousness are usually expressed verbally and used in relation to the standards of philosophical theories. Thus, for example, many notorious experiments of the field (e.g. Mary's room [25] and the philosopher's zombie are ambiguous because their specifications are unclear) and the so-called \"hard problem\" of consciousness (i.e. how physical processes in the brain lead to subjective experiences)."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The research of JFF was funded in part by grants 15 / 21689-2, Sa o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and by grants 303979 / 2013-5, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento J.J.Ifico e Tecnolo \u0301 gico (CNPq).

2017, "abstractText": "The brain\u2019s self-monitoring of activities, including internal activities \u2013 a functionality that we refer to as awareness \u2013 has been suggested as a key element of consciousness. Here we investigate whether the presence of an inner-eye-like process (monitor) that supervises the activities of a number of subsystems (operative agents) engaged in the solution of a problem can improve the problemsolving efficiency of the system. The problem is to find the global maximum of a NK fitness landscape and the performance is measured by the time required to find that maximum. The operative agents explore blindly the fitness landscape and the monitor provides them with feedback on the quality (fitness) of the proposed solutions. This feedback is then used by the operative agents to bias their searches towards the fittest regions of the landscape. We find that a weak feedback between the monitor and the operative agents improves the performance of the system, regardless of the difficulty of the problem, which is gauged by the number of local maxima in the landscape. For easy problems (i.e., landscapes without local maxima), the performance improves monotonically as the feedback strength increases, but for difficult problems, there is an optimal value of the feedback strength beyond which the system performance degrades very rapidly.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
