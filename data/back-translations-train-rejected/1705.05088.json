Providing a holistic security assessment for networks consisting of several hundreds hosts is hardly feasible though without some sort of mechanization. Mitigation, prioritizing counter- measures subject to a given budget, currently lacks a solid theoretical understanding and is hence more art than science. In this work, we propose the first approach for conduct- ing comprehensive what-if analyses in order to reason about mitigation in a conceptually well-founded manner. To evaluate and compare mitigation strategies, we use simulated penetration testing, i.e., automated attack-finding, based on a network model to which a subset of a given set of mitigation actions, e.g., changes to the network topology, system updates, configuration changes etc. is applied. We determine optimal combinations that minimize the maximal attacker success (similar to a Stackelberg game), and thus provide a well-founded basis for a holistic mitigation strategy. We show that these what-if analysis models can largely be derived from network scan, public vulnerability databases and manual inspection with various degrees of automation and detail, and we simulate mitigation analysis on networks of different size and vulnerability.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 07:05:34 GMT  (632kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05088v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.AI", "authors": ["michael backes", "j\\\"org hoffmann", "robert k\\\"unnemann", "patrick speicher", "marcel steinmetz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05088"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.05088.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Simulated Penetration Testing and Mitigation Analysis", "authors": ["Michael Backes", "J\u00f6rg Hoffmann", "Robert K\u00fcnnemann", "Marcel Steinmetz"], "emails": ["backes@mpi-sws.org", "hoffmann@cs.uni-saarland.de", "robert.kuennemann@cispa.saarland", "patrick.speicher@cispa.saarland", "steinmetz@cs.uni-saarland.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this paper, we propose the first approach to conducting comprehensive what-if analyses in order to make conceptually sound mitigation considerations.

Penetration Testing", "text": "We calculate critical attack paths by compiling test tasks for network penetration up to classical, deterministic planning formalities, which can then be solved using standard algorithms to determine minimum cost plans. This compilation consists of two steps. First, we apply the all-result determination to eliminate stochastic action results (e.g. [31], [53]). That is, we create a deterministic action ao for each attack action a and stochastic action costs: c (ao) = \u2212 log (p (o))), where ao has the same prerequisite as a, and the postcondition of o. Second, to output classical planning methods with the highest chance of success, we encode the result p (o) as cost of action: c (ao) = \u2212 log (p (o)))))) (cf.

Our workflow follows the same idea, but in addition, we include possible mitigation measures described in a concise and general scheme. Furthermore, our formalism looks at the probable / uncertain nature of exploitations.4"}, {"heading": "7.1.

We will therefore describe the following workflows that we evaluate in actual penetration scenarios as part of future work (illustrated in Figure 5). In the first step, the user scans a network using the nessus tool, resulting in an XML report. Our current toolchain only supports network-wide scans. Nessus, as well as several OVAL interpreters support host scans that can be centrally collected."}, {"heading": "7.2.

The network topology generation follows previous work on network penetration tests connected to the DMZ zone. Similar to the current example, we create networks that are divided into four zones: user, DMZ, sensitive and Internet. The Internet consists of only one host, initially under ad-serial control, which is connected to the DMZ zone. The DMZ and the sensitive zone each represent a subnet of hosts that are connected to both subnets. The user zone is a hierarchy, a tree of subnets in which each subnetwork is connected to its parent and its sensitive part."}], "references": [{"title": "A stubborn set algorithm for optimal planning", "author": ["Yusra Alkhazraji", "Martin Wehrle", "Robert Mattm\u00fcller", "Malte Helmert"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 20th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Scalable, graph-based network vulnerability analysis", "author": ["Paul Ammann", "Duminda Wijesekera", "Saket Kaushik"], "venue": "In ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2002}, {"title": "The oval R  \u00a9 language specification", "author": ["Jonathan Baker", "Matthew Hansbury", "Daniel Haynes"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Course of action generation for cyber security using classical planning", "author": ["Mark Boddy", "Jonathan Gohde", "Tom Haigh", "Steven Harp"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Optimal information security investment with penetration testing", "author": ["Rainer B\u00f6hme", "M\u00e1rk F\u00e9legyh\u00e1zi"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security (GameSec\u201910),", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Planning as heuristic search", "author": ["Blai Bonet", "H\u00e9ctor Geffner"], "venue": "Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Rational choice of security measures via multi-parameter attack trees", "author": ["Ahto Buldas", "Peeter Laud", "Jaan Priisalu", "M\u00e4rt Saarepera", "Jan Willemson"], "venue": "In 1st International Workshop on Critical Information Infrastructures Security (CRITIS\u201906),", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Upper bounds for adversaries\u2019 utility in attack trees", "author": ["Ahto Buldas", "Roman Stepanenko"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security (GameSec\u201912),", "citeRegEx": "9", "shortCiteRegEx": "9", "year": 2012}, {"title": "PCI DSS: A Pocket Guide, 3rd Edition", "author": ["Alan Calder", "Geraint Williams"], "venue": "IT Governance Publishing,", "citeRegEx": "10", "shortCiteRegEx": "10", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Computing optimal policies for attack graphs with action failures and costs", "author": ["Karel Durkota", "Viliam Lis\u00fd"], "venue": "In 7th European Starting AI Researcher Symposium (STAIRS\u201914),", "citeRegEx": "12", "shortCiteRegEx": "12", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Automated Planning: Theory and Practice", "author": ["Malik Ghallab", "Dana Nau", "Paolo Traverso"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "13", "shortCiteRegEx": "13", "year": 2004}, {"title": "An intelligent technique for generating minimal attack graph", "author": ["Nirnay Ghosh", "S.K.

Providing a holistic security assessment for networks consisting of several hundreds hosts is hardly feasible though without some sort of mechanization. Mitigation, prioritizing countermeasures subject to a given budget, currently lacks a solid theoretical understanding and is hence more art than science. In this work, we propose the first approach for conducting comprehensive what-if analyses in order to reason about mitigation in a conceptually well-founded manner. To evaluate and compare mitigation strategies, we use simulated penetration testing, i.e., automated attack-finding, based on a network model to which a subset of a given set of mitigation actions, e.g., changes to the network topology, system updates, configuration changes etc. is applied. We determine optimal combinations that minimize the maximal attacker success (similar to a Stackelberg game), and thus provide a well-founded basis for a holistic mitigation strategy. We show that these what-if analysis models can largely be derived from network scan, public vulnerability databases and manual inspection with various degrees of automation and detail, and we simulate mitigation analysis on networks of different size and vulnerability.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
