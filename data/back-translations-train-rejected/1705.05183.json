The requirement of huge investment of time as well as money and risk of failure in clinical trials have led to surge in interest in drug repositioning. DR exploits two major aspects associated with drugs and diseases: existence of similarity among drugs and among diseases due to their shared involved genes or pathways or common biological effects. Existing methods of identifying drug-disease association majorly rely on the information available in the structured databases only. On the other hand, abundant information available in form of free texts in biomedical research articles are not being fully exploited. Word-embedding or obtaining vector representation of words from a large corpora of free texts using neural network methods have been shown to give significant performance for several natural language processing tasks. In this work we propose a novel way of representation learning to obtain features of drugs and diseases by combining complementary information available in unstructured texts and structured datasets. Next we use matrix completion approach on these feature vectors to learn projection matrix between drug and disease vector spaces. The proposed method has shown competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Further, the case studies on Alzheimer's and Hypertension diseases have shown that the predicted associations are matching with the existing knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 12:29:52 GMT  (271kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05183v1", "Accepted to appear in 3rd IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics (Spl Session: Deep Learning for Prediction and Estimation)"], ["v2", "Sat, 20 May 2017 12:29:56 GMT  (1096kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05183v2", "Accepted to appear in 3rd IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics (Spl Session: Deep Learning for Prediction and Estimation)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to appear in 3rd IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics (Spl Session: Deep Learning for Prediction and Estimation)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sahil manchanda", "ashish anand"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05183"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.05183.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Sahil Manchanda", "Ashish Anand"], "emails": ["sahil.manchanda@iitg.ernet.in", "anand.ashish@iitg.ernet.in"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive by themselves if they do not play by the rules.

All 593 medicines are registered in the DrugBank and all 313 diseases are listed in the OMIM [13] database. As we have mentioned earlier, the proposed method is based on obtaining a wording for each drug and disease from a huge corpus of biomedical products, so that we must discard some medicines and diseases that we could not find in the corpus.

Drugs cause side effects when they bind to an off-target in addition to their desired on-targets. Assuming that if 2 drugs have side effects and therefore off-targets, there is a possibility that they share targets that can be used to cure diseases. Studies [16] show that drugs that share targets also bind to targets. (di, dj) This similarity is: Sim (di, dj) = | SE (di)."}, {"heading": "C.

Baseline Methods", "text": "We compare the proposed method with three other methods, MBIRW [28], HGBI [29] and TP-NRWRH [30]. For the sake of completeness, we briefly summarize each of the three methods. HGBI creates a heterogeneous network of two different types of nodes, one group of nodes representing different drugs and another group of nodes representing targets. Edges exist both within the same node types and between two different node types. The presence of edges depends on drug-drug similarities, target-similarities and drug-target interactions. The edge weights of the network are iteratively updated by all paths between the drug-target pairs. The MBIRW method constructs two separate networks on drugs and diseases. Both similarity networks have been created using novel similarity networks that take into account the correlation between different similarities."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "A. Vector representationFirst of all, we analyze the performance of our method in terms of the different length of feature vectors between 100 and 200. Figure 2 shows the AUC achieved by using different sizes of drugs and disease vectors. Although the increasing dimension generally led to an improved AUC score, the improvement was not really significant. Next, we analyze the importance of updating word vectors based on similarity values. We get an AUC score of 0.77 when word vectors obtained using the word2vec method from biomedical coptors are not updated. On the other hand, we get an AUC score of 0.86 when using updated word vectors. The relative improvement of 10% clearly indicates that the vectors acquired using our method better capture the similarity of drugs and diseases."}, {"heading": "B.

Of the top 10 drugs predicted by our method, 6 drugs, namely rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil, memantine, tacrine and valproic acid, have been approved for Alzheimer's disease. Other drugs, namely entacapone, pramipexol and carbidopa, have been used to treat Parkinson's disease.

RELATED WORK", "text": "Several calculation methods have been developed to solve the problem of drug repositioning, including machine learning as well as drugs developed on the basis of literature. Literature mining methods are mainly based on the simultaneous occurrence of drugs, diseases and targets within a context [33], [34]. These methods generally perform poorly because they do not use contextual semantic information and treat all kinds of relationships between two relevant terms equally. On the other hand, machine learning models have shown that they are relatively better than drugs that co-exist on the basis of drugs. [11] They developed a logistic regression model and combined various similarity measurements of drugs and diseases to predict drug-related associations. Wang et al. [35] applied support to Vector Machine's model of drug chemical structures, protein sequences and disease phenotypes to identify new relationships between drugs and diseases, one of the most important problems facing those is not available."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper we have presented a novel way of presenting medicines and diseases to obtain a vector representation, which is then used to obtain association values between medicines and diseases. The main contribution of this work is to combine complementary information available in unstructured texts and structured datasets. Heterogeneous information has been combined and trait vectors for medicines and diseases have been learned. Predictions with updated trait vectors have yielded better results than the use of the original word vectors. Case studies on hypertension and Alzheimer's disease suggest that predictions of our method can be used in biomedical research. We have compared our method with existing methods for repositioning medicines."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors would like to thank Shubhakar Reddy (former undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati) for providing us with the CUI mapping tool he developed."}], "references": [{"title": "New drug development in the united states from 1963 to 1999", "author": ["J.A.

approved drugs. The requirement of huge investment of time as well as money and risk of failure in clinical trials have led to surge in interest in drug repositioning. DR exploits two major aspects associated with drugs and diseases: existence of similarity among drugs and among diseases due to their shared involved genes or pathways or common biological effects. Existing methods of identifying drug-disease association majorly rely on the information available in the structured databases only. On the other hand, abundant information available in form of free texts in biomedical research articles are not being fully exploited. Word-embedding or obtaining vector representation of words from a large corpora of free texts using neural network methods have been shown to give significant performance for several natural language processing tasks. In this work we propose a novel way of representation learning to obtain features of drugs and diseases by combining complementary information available in unstructured texts and structured datasets. Next we use matrix completion approach on these feature vectors to learn projection matrix between drug and disease vector spaces. The proposed method has shown competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Further, the case studies on Alzheimer\u2019s and Hypertension diseases have shown that the predicted associations are matching with the existing knowledge.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
