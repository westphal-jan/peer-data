Resume Analysis (RA) provides opportunities for many applications, such as talent seeking and evaluation. Existing RA studies based on statistical analyzing have primarily focused on talent recruitment by identifying explicit attributes. However, they failed to discover the implicit semantic information, i.e., individual career progress patterns and social-relations, which are vital to comprehensive understanding of career development. Besides, how to visualize them for better human cognition is also challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose a visual analytics system ResumeVis to mine and visualize resume data. Firstly, a text-mining based approach is presented to extract semantic information. Then, a set of visualizations are devised to represent the semantic information in multiple perspectives. By interactive exploration on ResumeVis performed by domain experts, the following tasks can be accomplished: to trace individual career evolving trajectory; to mine latent social-relations among individuals; and to hold the full picture of massive resumes' collective mobility. Case studies with over 2500 online officer resumes demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We provide a demonstration video.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 13:13:47 GMT  (1061kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05206v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI", "authors": ["chen zhang", "hao wang", "yingcai wu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05206"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.05206.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "ResumeVis: A Visual Analytics System to Discover Semantic Information in Semi-structured Resume Data", "authors": ["Chen Zhang", "Hao Wang", "Yingcai Wu"], "emails": ["zhangchen@iscas.ac.cn", "wanghao@iscas.ac.cn", "ycwu@zju.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "CCS concepts \u2022 information systems, web mining \u2022 human-centric computing, visual analysis.Keywords Visual analysis; CV analysis; semantic information mining; text visualisation"}, {"heading": "1.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Description of Input Data", "text": "Electronic CV can be divided into two forms: structured (sr) and semi-structured (smr). sr is generally tabular and exists in the database. The data format of sr is well organized and usually fixed, so sr can be easily stored and managed. However, it is difficult to acquire sufficient sr for high-level semantic analysis, since the sr available on the Internet is limited and most sr as internal resources are private. On the other hand, smr is a type of text document and usually exists on the Internet. The data format of smr is diverse and contradictory due to text forms (txt, word, pdf, etc.), so it is not trivial to uniformly manage and analyze smr. As publicly available resources, smr are easy to obtain, which offer great opportunities for semantic-based intelligence."}, {"heading": "2.2 Design Requirements", "text": "Our system is part of a three-year project by the International Innovation Team launched by the K. C. Wong Education Foundation, which aims to monitor public opinion through online media. Five domain experts will be used to monitor this project, including a deputy institute director responsible for this project, two government officials whose tasks are management and training of cadres, a news analyst and a human resources expert in a company. Regular research discussion sessions and unscheduled ideas exchange meetings with these experts have been held since 2014. As part of this communication, the experts have clarified their requirements and evaluated the prototypes developed for the project."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 Requirements in mining phase", "text": "R1 Semantic Elements Extraction. First, to extract career-related information mentioned in Section 2.1. Second, to quantify the career start of the resume at each career stage. Let's take the official title as an example: President, Vice President, Governor, Mayor, Deputy Mayor, District Headmaster, Deputy District Headmaster and Civil servant are quantified as rank 8 to rank 0.R2 Sample identification. First, to determine personal career progress. A domain expert claims that an effective feature for pattern identification at each career stage can be the progression rate of the resume. Second, to discover interpersonal social patterns based on social relationships between CVs. Social relationships can be explicit where the intersection between the career experiences of the individual exists. Relationships can also implicitly imply that the individual's career progression is similar. The interpersonal network patterns can be used to perform numerous social engineering tasks."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Requirements in visualization phase", "text": "R4 Representation of the CV from overview to detail. In dealing with numerous CVs, users need multi-level visualization to examine career trajectories from overview to detail and perceive career progress patterns in a comprehensible way.

Visualization should facilitate comparison between CVs with different progress patterns and social patterns through metaphorical representation, in which the career path of a CV and the social relationships between CVs can be intuitively represented (Fig. 5a & 5b). R6 Visualization of collective mobility from massive CVs. Visualization should summarize collective mobility across time and organizational dimensions, so that users can quickly get the complete picture of numerous summaries and gain insights.

It consists of three phases: The mining phase is described in Section 3. Input data is loaded, semantic elements are extracted, and pattern information is extracted from mines.The visualization phase and interaction phase are described in Section 4. The first contains three visualization modules that support visual exploration and analysis of mined semantic information. The latter forms a loop between mining and visualization, in which users are involved to perceive, gain insights, and generate feedback, such as tuning parameters."}, {"heading": "3. SEMANTIC EXTRACTION", "text": "In the left part of Fig. 2, the approach contains four components: preprocessing, analysis, ranking quantification and semantic mining."}, {"heading": "3.1 Parsing", "text": "We propose a method to analyze semi-structured CVs using Chinese word segmentation and Chinese / Chinese / Chinese end-time techniques (R1). Fig. 3 shows an example of an extraction result based on the CV in Fig. 1. In Fig. 3, the BI section and E section are extracted and stored in XML format in a structured CV base. The BI section contains some keywords such as / Name, / Gender and / Nation. We use information extraction technology [14] to extract these keywords. The E section contains a list of experience records in chronological order. Each data set consists of some keywords: / DateBegin, / DateEnd, / Location, / Org and / Title. In the case that all experience records are within one paragraph of the original CV, we use / DateBegin and / DateEnd separators to structure a paragraph."}, {"heading": "3.2 Rank Quantification", "text": "We quantify the career start of each individual data set (< rank > in fig. 3) and take the administrative levels mentioned in Chinese civil service law [36, 37] as a reference for the quantification rules. For example, mayors of ordinary cities should be quantified to rank 4 (R1). However, there are many exceptions. For example, mayors of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing should be quantified to rank 6, as these four cities are municipalities that are directly under the central government and rank higher than ordinary citizens. Finally, we extract a career order based on these rules and exceptions. Table 1 shows an example of the career order in fig. 3. Please note that each section of the career order, including ranking, may be changed by users in fig. 6 if the information is incorrect due to the complexity of Chinese administration and numerous special cases."}, {"heading": "3.3 Semantic Mining", "text": "After receiving the CV with quantified career start, we perform various mining methods to discover semantic patterns (R2)."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Discovering individual career patterns", "text": "We employ Na\u00efve Bayes [18] to discover individual patterns; the resumes are divided into different categories based on their personal experiences; each category is considered a career progression pattern; the unlabeled resume can be automatically classified by the model trained on labeled resumes; 1. Definition of career progression patterns Taking the mean of all resumes as a baseline, the domain experts defined three types of career progression patterns to describe resumes with different career paths: ascending, steady and recessionary. In Figure 4, ascending represents the resum\u00e9 that the ranking rate (red line) is observably higher than the average rate (black point line) over the entire time dimension; steady represents the resume that the average growth rate over the entire time dimension is approximately the same; recessionary represents the resum\u00e9 that the overall ranking growth rate is the average growth rate over the entire time dimension."}, {"heading": "4. VISULIZATION DESIGN", "text": "In order to meet the requirements in the visualization phase (R4 ~ R8), we provide our system with three visualization modules."}, {"heading": "4.1 Career Trajectory Chart", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "4.2 Interpersonal Relationship Graph", "text": "In Fig. 5b, we present a spiral graph based on the ego network to illustrate interpersonal relationships between a focus person referred to as a central node and other relatives referred to as surrounding nodes. As a supplement to the career log diagram, this graph can allow users to understand the \"context information\" of the focus person. When users right-click on the symbol of a resume M, the graph is constructed in which M is the central point and kM is the node surrounding it. The node is visualized as a rounded rectangle with the name of the person on it. Please note kM is calculated in Section 3.3.2, where the distance between the central node and a surrounding node encodes the relationship value between the focus person and a related person. That is, abbreviated edge means closed relations between the closed relation of the tool node and the relation of the K can be specified."}, {"heading": "4.3 Organization-Individual Mobility Map", "text": "This map uses the metaphor \"quadrant chart\" (right part of fig. 2) to represent collective mobility over temporal and organizational dimensions (R6). Here, organizations are classified as four categories, taking into account the suggestions and comments of several domain experts: governments, grassroots, state-owned enterprises (or corporations) and non-profit organizations. Resumes belonging to the same type of organization form a community. Therefore, curricula vitae are divided as five communities: four basic communities and a composite community in which individuals belong to several types of organization. in the right part of fig. 2, each node denotes an individual from whom size encodes rank. The map is divided as five regions to encode five communities: four basic communities and the circular region in the middle denotes the composition of the community."}, {"heading": "5. CASE STUDY", "text": "We evaluated the system using three case studies. In each study, some real-world tasks were designed by three of our domain experts, the other two experts then had to use the system to solve the tasks. Prior to the evaluation, the experts spent two hours using the system so that they were familiar with the system. They received feedback from the experts after the evaluation. The data set contains 2640 online CVs collected from Chinese government websites at various levels."}, {"heading": "5.1 Individual Career Progress Analysis", "text": "T1: Summary of the general rule of career development. T2: Comparing different career paths of different CVs. T3: Searching for a target official based on semantic information. These tasks are essential for the government to select and promote potential officials. It is assumed that selecting suitable officials for further promotion is not trivial, as many aspects of individual needs need must be taken into account, such as the rate of career advancement at different stages. However, there is no quantitative standard for assessing these aspects. Currently, this task is carried out manually, as each CV is only characterised by reading CVs."}, {"heading": "5.2 Interpersonal Social-relations Analysis", "text": "T4: Finding similar or relevant CVs (people) based on the focus CV (individuals). T5: Validating unknown / unfaithful CVs. Please note that T4 is important for the government to discover the interpersonal relationship and even the social network in the Chinese government, which can facilitate the fight against corruption. As experts examined the interpersonal relationship curve of the focus person named \"Tony,\" experts observed that surrounding points can be classified as two clusters: Cluster X and Y. By examining the detailed information on the relationships between the central point and clusters, experts realized that the duration of career crossings between the central point and X is significantly greater than that of Y. Furthermore, the intersection of Fens was shown, i.e. the organizational type of X is \"company,\" while the intersection of Y \"is non-profit."}, {"heading": "5.3 Collective Mobility Analysis", "text": "The solution of T6 and T7 enables decision-makers to become aware of the career situation of officers from a macroscopic perspective and to develop reasonable strategies accordingly, such as the management and control of the process of officer training, appointment and dismissal. By animating and interacting with the mobility map of individual organisations in Fig. 10a, experts can gain two valuable insights. Firstly, there is a \"boom\" in officer promotion during 2009 / 11 / 01 and 2010 / 01 / 01 (The dense area of the government section in Fig. 10a). Fig. 10f proves this \"booming\" phenomenon, which shows the upward trend throughout the period. Therefore, experts conclude that the reason behind this development may be the fourth plenary session of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China."}, {"heading": "5.4 User Feedback", "text": "We gathered the feedback of the two experts. In Table 2, the experts were asked to rate the functionality and usability of our system for each task, and the scores could be 5 (excellent), 4 (good), 3 (average), 2 (not good) or 1 (bad). However, the experts then gave their comments on the user experience. Both experts were very impressed with the system, in particular the semantic information revealed, which can support their decision making well. They suggested that the presentation of CVs in multiple perspectives was \"comprehensive\" and \"valuable for human cognition and perception of knowledge.\" In particular, the first expert highlighted the novelty of career paths to outline the career path. He said: \"I have never seen such a visualization that can intuitively represent the career path from the life course data.\" He was very impressed by the study of the resume data from the overview in detail. He believed that the metaphor used in the system can definitely improve the efficiency of RA."}, {"heading": "6. RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Resume Analysis", "text": "The prototype of CV analysis is the personal experience analysis born during the Second World War.

There are a lot of NLP toolkits, such as Stanford CoreNLP [10], UIMA [15], and GATE [16]. In the field of data mining, classification and association rules are linked to our system, as our system categorizes people into different categories based on their experiences and mines relationships between people. Popular classification techniques are Decision Trees [17], Na\u00efve Bayes [18], and Support Vector Machine [19].

CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper presents a visual analytics prototype based on CV data to help users understand the semantic patterns hidden in the CVs. First, a text-mining-based approach is presented to extract the semantic information, then three visualization modules are developed to present the semantic information in multiple perspectives, and through in-depth interaction and exploration by domain experts, our system proves to be effective. Further work can focus on extending the visualization to the geographical dimension, taking into account time-spatial mobility information, and designing better visual encodings to depict social relationships and coordinated interactions between different viewpoints."}, {"heading": "8.

"Massive public resume data emerging on the WWW indicates individual-related characteristics in terms of profile and career experiences. Resume Analysis (RA) provides opportunities for many applications, such as talent seeking and evaluation. Existing RA studies based on statistical analyzing have primarily focused on talent recruitment by identifying explicit attributes. However, they failed to discover the implicit semantic information, i.e., individual career progress patterns and social-relations, which are vital to comprehensive understanding of career development. Besides, how to visualize them for better human cognition is also challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose a visual analytics system ResumeVis to mine and visualize resume data. Firstly, a text-mining based approach is presented to extract semantic information. Then, a set of visualizations are devised to represent the semantic information in multiple perspectives. By interactive exploration on ResumeVis performed by domain experts, the following tasks can be accomplished: to trace individual career evolving trajectory; to mine latent social-relations among individuals; and to hold the full picture of massive resumes\u2019 collective mobility. Case studies with over 2500 online officer resumes demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We provide a demonstration video.", "creator": "\u00fe\u00ff"}}}
