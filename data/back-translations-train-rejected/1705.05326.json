Constrained Bayesian Networks generalize a Bayesian Network such that probabilities can be symbolic, arithmetic expressions and where the meaning of the network is constrained by finitely many formulas from the theory of the reals. A formal semantics for constrained Bayesian Networks over first-order logic of the reals is given, which enables non-linear and non-convex optimisation algorithms that rely on decision procedures for this logic, and supports the composition of several constrained Bayesian Networks. A non-trivial case study in arms control, where few or no data are available to assess the effectiveness of an arms inspection process, evaluates our approach. An open-access prototype implementation of these foundations and their algorithms uses the SMT solver Z3 as decision procedure, leverages an open-source package for Bayesian inference to symbolic computation, and is evaluated experimentally.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 16:48:12 GMT  (979kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05326v1", "43 pages, 18 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "43 pages, 18 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paul beaumont", "michael huth"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05326"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.05326.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Constrained Bayesian Networks: Theory, Optimization, and Applications", "authors": ["Paul Beaumont"], "emails": ["m.huthu@imperial.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Bayesian faith network.

Nodes in this DAG represent random variables defined by discrete probability distributions, which are also a function of the random variables represented by the parent nodes in the DAG. In other words, a random variable depends on the random variables of their parent nodes. We can use a BN to calculate probabilities for events of interest about these random variables. Bayesian Inference also allows us to revise such probabilities when additional observations of the \"evidence\" have been made. Figure 1 shows a simple BN that is part of the folklore of the Bayesian Networks example. It describes the possible causes of nassem grass on two neighboring countries. \"For example, the probabilities of Holmes\" Grass Wet are conditioned on the output of sprinklers. \""}, {"heading": "3 Constrained Bayesian Networks", "text": "Informally, a limited BN is determined from a BN by replacing one or more probabilities in its probability tables with symbolic expressions and adding constraints on variables used in those expressions or in quantitative terms of interest, and on variables relating to marginal probabilities of interest. We write BCX for limited BN with a series of constraints C and variable numbers X.To illustrate the probability tables for two nodes sprinklers and Rain in the BN in Figure 1, symbolic x is used to obtain a limited BN. This allows us to model strict uncertainties (also known as Knightian uncertainty) in the actual value of such probabilities. Our approach allows to divide variables across such tables, as x is divided in the tables for sprinklers and Rain. This is certainly useful to express that one particular subjective probability is twice as likely as another."}, {"heading": "3.1 Theoretical Foundations", "text": "We begin the development by defining grammars for symbolic expressions that occur in probability tables and for properties that contain such expressions as arguments. Figure 3 shows definitions for real-valued terms in which the real constants, and x and mp real variables that extend over variable sentences Xx and Xmp, are each defined. Distinction between mp and x can occur in symbolic expressions in probability tables of nodes or denotes that contain quantitative measures of interest. We write XxYXmp for the disjunctive union of such variable sets.Constraints are quantifier-free forms that are constructed using terms, logical truth constants, and propositional operators."}, {"heading": "3.2 Semantic Judgments", "text": "We propose two semantic judgments that allow us to explore the characteristics of BCX in the worst-case and best-case realms. Both semantic judgments are also based on a satisfaction relationship between concretizing BNs and queries. We define this formal uncertainty as to whether BCX can be a limited BN. For all other semantic judgments, both are based on a satisfaction relationship between concretizing BNs and queries. Definition 9 Let BCX be a limited BN.

For a solid, limited BCX formula BCX, we can see this meaning within logic Q itself as satisfaction testing."}, {"heading": "3.5 Constrained Union Operator", "text": "We want the ability to compare two or more restricted BNs or to discover relationships between them. This is facilitated by an idea of the composition of the limited BNs that we are now developing. Let's look at two limited BNs BC1X1 and B C2 X2. Our intuition for the composition is to use a fragmented union of the individual limited BNs so that each node in this unified DAG still has its symbolic probability table. This union names nodes that appear in both diagrams, so that the union is actually fragmented. We then consider C1 Y C2 as a set of constraints on the resulting limited BNs. It is useful to make this composition dependent on constraints. The idea is that C can define known or assumed relationships between these BNs."}, {"heading": "In particular, the absolute value of the difference of the marginal probability (2) in those", "text": "These union operators are symmetrical in that BC1X1 CYBC2X2 and B C2 X2 CYBC1X1 meet the same judgments.

Then it is defined as a sentence that defines the \"BCXr\u03b1ptq\" of the term \"BCX.\" So it is a term whose variables all in X stand for a limited BN BCX.

Designing such processes is a challenge as it must ensure sufficient mutual trust between the reviewed and verifying parties in the presence of potentially conflicting interests.

Calculation of the symbolic meaning of margins is based on the junction tree algorithm and is achieved by software from an open source Python package provided in [5]. Python also supports a lightweight open source library for symbolic computation, sympy [34], which we can use to fully symbolically execute the junction tree algorithm in [5]. The generated symbolic expressions are then simplified using a method of sympy, before being incorporated into constraints such as in (3) and added to the SMT solver for analysis."}, {"heading": "5.2 Validation and Evaluation", "text": "Some symbolic margins that we generated for analysis but did not report in our case study were too large to be handled by the SMT solver we used: the string representation of the symbolic meaning was about 25 megabytes. We performed a linear regression of these symbolic expressions, and then confirmed that this approximation was more precise than the accuracy of \u03b4 before defining the meaning of boundary variables such as these regressed expressions. Our research data discussed on page 34 contain details of these analyses. We evaluated the performance of the symbolic interpretation of the JTA as implemented in [5] on randomly generated limited BNs. This does not evaluate our approach per se, but the way we symbolically interpreted an existing inference implementation. We refer to our open data repository for more details on the model generation: key parameters are the number of nodes N | X, the number of variables, the number of Xx, the number of variables."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "Our approach advocates the use of limited Bayesian networks as a means of gaining trust in Bayesian network modeling and inferring in the face of little or no data. Therefore, a modeler could start with a BN, turn it into several limited BNs and analyze them, and perhaps modify the BN based on such findings. Witness information computed in analyses could in principle be returned to a BN modeling tool so that users can see a concrete BN that explains, for example, how to achieve a marginal value in a limited BN. The ability to present witness information as a concrete BN is also a means of testing whether the calculation of the symbolic meaning of marginals is free of errors. We have actually performed such tests to gain confidence in the correctness of our tool and the packages on which it depends."}, {"heading": "7 Related Work", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "A Mathematical Proofs", "text": "X-X X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X X-X-X-X-X-X-X X-X-X X X X-X-X-X X X-X-X-X X X-X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X"}, {"heading": "B Quantitative Information about the BN of Figure 11", "text": "Table 1 shows quantitative information on the size and complexity of BN in Figure 11."}], "references": [{"title": "Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning", "author": ["David Barber"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2012}, {"title": "An in-depth case study: modelling an information barrier in Bayesian belief networks", "author": ["Paul Beaumont", "Edward Day", "Neil Evans", "Sam Haworth", "Michael Huth", "Tom Plant", "Catherine Roberts"], "venue": "In Journal of the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management,", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Confidence analysis for nuclear arms control: SMT abstractions of Bayesian Belief Networks", "author": ["Paul Beaumont", "Neil Evans", "Michael Huth", "Tom Plant"], "venue": "In Computer Security - ESORICS 2015 - 20th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security, Vienna,", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Bayesian Robustness, pages 1\u201332", "author": ["James O.

Constrained Bayesian Networks generalize a Bayesian Network such that probabilities can be symbolic, arithmetic expressions and where the meaning of the network is constrained by finitely many formulas from the theory of the reals. A formal semantics for constrained Bayesian Networks over first-order logic of the reals is given, which enables non-linear and non-convex optimization algorithms that rely on decision procedures for this logic, and supports the composition of several constrained Bayesian Networks. A non-trivial case study in arms control, where few or no data are available to assess the effectiveness of an arms inspection process, evaluates our approach. An open-access prototype implementation of these foundations and their algorithms uses the SMT solver Z3 as decision procedure, leverages an open-source package for Bayesian inference to symbolic computation, and is evaluated experimentally.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
