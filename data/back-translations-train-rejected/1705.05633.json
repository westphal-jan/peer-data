Since a substance use ground truth is difficult to obtain on a large scale, to maximize system performance, we explore different feature learning methods to take advantage of a large amount of unsupervised social media data. We also demonstrate the benefit of using multi-view unsupervised feature learning to combine heterogeneous user information such as Facebook `\"likes\" and \"status updates\" to enhance system performance. Based on our evaluation, our best models achieved 86% AUC for predicting tobacco use, 81% for alcohol use and 84% for drug use, all of which significantly outperformed existing methods. Our investigation has also uncovered interesting relations between a user's social media behavior (e.g., word usage) and substance use.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 10:37:52 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05633v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 31 May 2017 19:38:14 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05633v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["tao ding", "warren k bickel", "shimei pan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05633"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.05633.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Social Media-based Substance Use Prediction", "authors": ["Tao Ding", "Warren K.

According to the 2014 National Study on Drug Use and Health, one in ten Americans 12 years and older had substance use disorder. Substance use also costs Americans more than $700 billion a year in increased health costs, crime and lost productivity (NIDA, 2015). Nowadays, people also spend a lot of time on social media such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to interact with friends and family, share ideas and thoughts, provide status updates, and organize events and activities. The pervasive and widespread use of social media underscores the need to investigate its intersection with substance use and its potential as a scalable and cost-effective solution for screening and preventing substance abuse and abuse."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Substance use disorder (SUD) comprises a complex pattern of behavior. Many studies have automatically found a strong link between personal traits and substance use. (Campbell et al., 2014) For example, have found that smokers exhibit significantly higher openness to experience and lower conscientiousness, a personality trait associated with a tendency to show self-discipline, to act dutifully, and to achieve the goal. (Cook et al., 1998) have investigated the associations between alcohol use and personality and found that alcohol consumption positively correlates with sociability and extraversion. (Terracciano et al, 2008) conducted a study with 1102 participants and found a link between drug use and low conscience. (Cook et al., 2009) revealed risk factors related to addiction such as age, sex, impulsivity, curiosity, tendency to neighborhood behaviors, and dependence on substances."}, {"heading": "3 Dataset", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, without being able to survive on their own.

Since the SUD probability is a neat variable and the LIWC / LDA characteristics are numerical, we have focused on the Spearman ranking correlation to identify characteristics that are most significantly correlated to SUD, the LIWC characteristics that are significantly related to at least one type of SUD (p < 0.05).

Furthermore, our best SPE model only has 50 dimensions, while our best SLE model has 300 dimensions. This could be because the monitored training data used by SPE is almost three times smaller than that used by SLE. Surprisingly, however, SPE-based models performed better than SLE-based models. We expect that with more training data, the performance of SPE-based methods can be further improved."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "We believe that social media is a promising platform both for studying SUD-related human behaviors and for engaging the public in the prevention and early detection of substance abuse.

We also demonstrate the benefit of using multi-view unsupervised feature learning to combine heterogeneous user information such as Facebook \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cstatus updates\u201d to enhance system performance. Based on our evaluation, our best models achieved 86% AUC for predicting tobacco use, 81% for alcohol use and 84% for drug use, all of which significantly outperformed existing methods.
