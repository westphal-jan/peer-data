Subjective knowledge differs from objective knowledge in that it has no documented or observed ground truth. Instead, the truth relies on people's dominant opinion. Thus, we can use the crowdsourcing technique to get opinion from the crowd. In our work, we propose a system, called crowdsourced subjective knowledge acquisition (CoSKA),for subjective knowledge acquisition powered by crowdsourcing and existing KBs. The acquired knowledge can be used to enrich existing KBs in the subjective dimension which bridges the gap between existing objective knowledge and subjective queries.The main challenge of CoSKA is the conflict between large scale knowledge facts and limited crowdsourcing resource. To address this challenge, in this work, we define knowledge inference rules and then select the seed knowledge judiciously for crowdsourcing to maximize the inference power under the resource constraint. Our experimental results on real knowledge base and crowdsourcing platform verify the effectiveness of CoSKA system.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 14:25:02 GMT  (1735kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05720v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["rui meng", "hao xin", "lei chen", "yangqiu song"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05720"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.05720.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Subjective Knowledge Acquisition and Enrichment Powered By Crowdsourcing", "authors": ["Rui Meng Hao", "Xin Lei Chen", "Yangqiu Song"], "emails": ["rmeng@cse.ust.hk", "hxinaa@cse.ust.hk", "leichen@cse.ust.hk", "yqsong@cse.ust.hk"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

CROWDSOURCED ST PAIR APPLYING", "text": "For a particular ST pair, the task of subjective knowledge acquisition is to determine the prevailing opinion on whether the subjective property can be applied to the instances of the type referred to as the Crowdsourcing ST pair. However, it is too costly to ask the crowd for each instance, as one type in a KB could contain hundreds of thousands of instances. Therefore, we formulate the Crowdsourcing ST pair, which is considered a binary classification problem, taking advantage of the knowledge in the KBs. In each case, we decide whether the ST pair can be applied by the classification result. However, we do not have any designated data to train the classifier. Therefore, we select a number of seed instances and ask the crowd-sourcing samples to collect the corresponding subjective knowledge facts. We take the crowd-sourcing samples as training data and train the classifier on the basis of the attributes extracted from the KB, as we would have these relationships in a series of KB / KB relationships."}, {"heading": "5.

Given an ST pair, we need to get the knowledge about whether a subjective property can be applied to the instances of the type. In order to reduce costs, we design the task as a multiple-choice question, where each question contains 5 instances and the crowdworker is asked to select those that the gift property can be applied to. Furthermore, we list all properties of the given type in each HIT and let the crowdworker select the properties that would influence the decision. We calculate the vote for each feature and keep those with the vote number that exceeds the threshold (through experimental studies) for further classification models. The HIT interface is shown in Figure 4.

Induced Edge Weight of ST pairs, which show the inference power of selected ST pairs, we can, however, apply three other algorithms: the number of different types of ST pairs used to evaluate knowledge diversity; 3). Runtime recorded to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, we implement three other algorithms: reverse greedy selection algorithms (BGreedy), forward greedy selection algorithms (FGreedy), and random selection algorithms. We vary the number of selected ST pairs from 10 \"100\" and fix the threshold for diversity-based \"greedy\" algorithms (Div-FGreedy) to 0.1. \""}, {"heading": "6.4 Knowledge Inference", "text": "After applying the Crowdsourcing ST application process, we have acquired a number of subjective knowledge facts, either gathered from the crowd or obtained by the classification model. Afterwards, we can perform knowledge conclusions to obtain more knowledge facts. Some are similar to the relationship of the selected ST pairs in Table 4. In order to verify the effectiveness of our approach to knowledge conclusion, we evaluate two metrics: the number of derived facts and the accuracy of the derived facts. Since we do not have the basic truth, we sample 100 facts for each pair and manually verify the accuracy. We ask three students to mark whether the fact is correct or not, and deduce the answer by majority decision. The results of the knowledge conclusion will be shown in Table 5.From the results, we can determine that on the one hand, a large amount of knowledge facts could be derived by the subjective knowledge conclusion approach; on the other hand, the derived knowledge facts have a high accuracy, we can ascertain the accuracy of the subjective knowledge facts presented by the ST in the table, 3."}, {"heading": "7. RELATED WORK", "text": "In this section, we discuss the work related to subjective knowledge acquisition, knowledge base enrichment, and crowdsourcing. Subjective knowledge acquisition is closely related to works that associate characteristics with entities. Some work has been done for common sense knowledge acquisition [18] [15] [24]. WebChild [23] is a method for automatically building a large healthy knowledge base, it contains triples that associate nouns with adjectives about fine-grained relationships. Entitytagger [5], presented by Chakrabarti et al., automatically associate descriptive phrases, referred to as etags (entity tags), to each entity. Instead of subjective characteristics, these works focus on the less controversial and objective characteristics, which have nothing to do with obtaining dominant opinion. The most similar work is SURVEYOR, which holds the prevailing opinion on web properties, whether a subjective property is applied to a property."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our CoSKA system consists of three stages: ST pair selection, Crowdsourcing-ST pair application, and Knowledge Conclusion. To resolve the conflict between large-scale knowledge facts and the limited crowdsourcing resource, we define subjective knowledge conclusions between ST pairs and conduct knowledge conclusions to derive more knowledge facts. We formulate the ST pair selection problem as a maximum knowledge inference problem that is NP-hard, and propose a diversity-conscious, greedy forward algorithm for ST pair selection. Crowdsourcing-ST pair application problem is formulated as a classification task to further improve the scalability of the system. Experimental results on a real-world knowledge basis and crowdsourcing platform that compares an accurate crowdsourcing system at high cost, could substantiate SKA facts with an extensive crowdsourcing system."}, {"heading": "9.

attention due to its great success in various areas, such as Web and mobile search. Existing KBs are restricted to objective factual knowledge, such as CITY POPULATION or FRUIT SHAPE, whereas, subjective knowledge, such as BIG CITY, which is commonly mentioned in Web and mobile queries, has been neglected. Subjective knowledge differs from objective knowledge in that it has no documented or observed ground truth. Instead, the truth relies on people\u2019s dominant opinion. Thus, we can use the crowdsourcing technique to get opinion from the crowd. In our work, we propose a system, called crowdsourced subjective knowledge acquisition (CoSKA), for subjective knowledge acquisition powered by crowdsourcing and existing KBs. The acquired knowledge can be used to enrich existing KBs in the subjective dimension which bridges the gap between existing objective knowledge and subjective queries. The main challenge of CoSKA is the conflict between large scale knowledge facts and limited crowdsourcing resource. To address this challenge, in this work, we define knowledge inference rules and then select the seed knowledge judiciously for crowdsourcing to maximize the inference power under the resource constraint. Our experimental results on real knowledge base and crowdsourcing platform verify the effectiveness of CoSKA system.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
