We consider settings that allow for active queries or passive observation of a stream of queries, and give analyses both at the granularity of individuals or populations that might exhibit heterogeneous choice behavior.

Crucially, a user has a ranking of alternatives that are hidden from us, and by observing their choices, that the choices made in these online environments have a uniform structure: users are confronted with a number of options - a list of recommended books, search results, flight options or users they follow - and they choose one or more elements from the set. The ubiquity of this framework has led to an active line of research on the problem of learning, the ranking of functions [1]. There are many formulations in the literature, but the essence is to assume that a ranking stands above alternatives that are hidden from us, and by observing their choices we would like to introduce this ranking."}, {"heading": "2 Active query complexity", "text": "We will first focus on active query algorithms based sequentially on the results of previous queries, and our goal is to develop algorithms that, after a small number of queries, can either use any k-set function to select the \"th alternative of k for some ordering\"; we will mark this function with qk. \"Our results in this section show that for each fixed k-based operation and each fixed but unknown\" [1, k} we can, in fact, learn the output of an efficient twophase algorithm that performs only O (n log n) queries (up to a reflection we will discuss below), but we also give a simple algorithm that performs recovery (until recovery)."}, {"heading": "3 Population mixtures", "text": "The results in the previous section assume that all queries have been evaluated from the same deterministic selection function to some degree of compromise, with f (S) consistently selecting the \"th ordered alternative from each k-set S.\" In this section, we show that we can restore selection functions in a more general environment in which the position selected by f is drawn over possible positions independently of a distribution. This setting includes two generalizations of our active query results, all of which base their decisions on the same ordered embedding, but differ in which position an individual is repeatedly queried, and may have compromise effects for some queries, independently of each other. Second, it describes situations in which queries are processed by individuals who base all their decisions on the same ordered embedding, but differ in an order in which their selection functions are selected. We show that we can still restore selection functions in this setting using O (n log queries), almost."}, {"heading": "4 Passive query complexity", "text": "We shift our attention to passive query algorithms, algorithms that make all their queries at once, without the sequential utility of previous responses. This framework is motivated by a common scenario of studying large sets of recorded choices of online marketplaces, ranking algorithms, and referral systems. Could we still restore the selection function made by sets of alternatives, but often the queries cannot be directed adaptively toward our goal of restoring selection functions. What if we simply had a large corpus of choices by an individual about random subsets? If so, how few queries we would need, we analyze a model for this process in which we are unable to select queries, but must passively observe them instead. We focus on the output of a single f; handling population mixes in a passive query model is an interesting open question.Model of passive selection streams. We analyze the process of picking and analyzing the subsequent process of picking and picking over time."}, {"heading": "5 Distance comparison", "text": "The question of whether this type of function is surprisingly rich, with the ability to capture compromise effects in decisions along any one-dimensional boundary, cannot be answered. In this section, we shift our focus to restoring selection functions defined by another structural relationship, namely distance comparisons in a metric embedding. A selection function for k-sets is a distance comparison if the value f (S) can be calculated using comparison functions defined by another structural relationship, namely distance comparisons. A selection function for k-sets is a distance comparison, if the value f (S) can be calculated from comparisons."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "The prevalence of choice-set effects in human decision-making underlines the need for a principled conclusion that can support the learning of such effects.

We begin by mentioning passive issues and population misunderstandings, without trying to combine these two aspects to derive a mixed collection of election functions."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning to Rank (NIPS workshop)", "author": ["Shivani Agarwal", "Corinna Cortes", "Ralf Herbrich"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Sorting, approximate sorting, and searching in rounds", "author": ["Noga Alon", "Yossi Azar"], "venue": "SIAM J Discrete Math,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1988}, {"title": "Random utility models in marketing research: a survey", "author": ["George Baltas", "Peter Doyle"], "venue": "J Bus Res,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2001}, {"title": "On the relevance of irrelevant alternatives", "author": ["Austin Benson", "Ravi Kumar", "Andrew Tomkins"], "venue": "In WWW,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Sorting in one round", "author": ["B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s", "Moshe Rosenfeld"], "venue": "Israel Journal of Mathematics,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 1981}, {"title": "Sorting from noisy information", "author": ["Mark Braverman", "Elchanan Mossel"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:0910.1191,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Modeling intransitivity in matchup and comparison data", "author": ["Shuo Chen", "Thorsten Joachims"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Predicting matchups and preferences in context", "author": ["Shuo Chen", "Thorsten Joachims"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2016}, {"title": "The money pump as a measure of revealed preference violations", "author": ["Federico Echenique", "Sangmok Lee", "Matthew Shum"], "venue": "Journal of Political Economy,", "citeRegEx": "9", "shortCiteRegEx": "9", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Computing with noisy information", "author": ["Uriel Feige", "Prabhakar Raghavan", "David Peleg", "Eli Upfal"], "venue": "SIAM J.
