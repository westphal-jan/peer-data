McDonald and Nivre (2011) identify two types of data-driven methods for dependence: graph-based approaches (Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005; Koo and Collins, 2010) and transition-based approaches (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003). Most traditional graphics or transition-based parsing approaches manually define a set of core and combined traits associated with hot representation (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Bohnet, 2010; Zhang and Nivre, Nivre, Nivre, Nivre, 2011; Ballevre et al., 2013; Choi and McCallum, 2013; Recent work shows that learning is deeply dependent in dependency."}, {"heading": "2 Our joint model", "text": "In this area, we are in a position to operate in the areas of public services and services of general interest, in which we are in the areas of public services and public services of general interest.

We use a specified random seed, and we do not use pre-trained embedding in any experiment. According to Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016b) and Plank et al. (2016), we apply a word failure rate of 0.25 and gauss noise with \u03c3 = 0.2 after each training period. For the training, we run for 30 epochs and evaluate the mixed accuracy of the correct assignment of POS tag along with dependency sheet and relationship type to the development epoch. We perform a minimal grid search of hyper parameters in English. We find that the highest mixed accuracy on the English development parameters 2016 consists of ZPTDP (if we include word parameters 128-12hi-1dimension.org)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Main results", "text": "Table 1 compares the POS marking and dependence on the results of our model jPTDP with results obtained in previous work using the same experimental setup.In terms of POS marking, our common model jPTDP generally achieves similar POS marking accuracies as the SOTA-BiLSTM aux model (Plank et al., 2016).Our model also achieves a higher average POS marking accuracy than the SOTA common model stack propagation (Zhang and White, 2016).Note that there are slightly higher marking results than English, it took 6 hours for training with these hyperparameters, and then you get a speed of 700 words / second, which are evaluated on a 2.2 GHz Core i7 processor."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we describe our novel model for joint POS tagging and graph-based dependency parsing using bidirectional LSTM-based feature representations.
