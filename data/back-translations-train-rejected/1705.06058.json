Automated algorithm configuration methods have recently received much attention in the AI community since they replace tedious, irreproducible and error-prone manual parameter tuning and can lead to new state-of-the-art performance. However, practical applications of algorithm configuration are prone to several (often subtle) pitfalls in the experimental design that can render the procedure ineffective. We identify several common issues and propose best practices for avoiding them, including a tool called GenericWrapper4AC for preventing the many possible problems in measuring the performance of the algorithm being optimized by executing it in a standardized, controlled manner.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 May 2017 09:07:46 GMT  (379kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06058v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["katharina eggensperger", "marius lindauer", "frank hutter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.06058"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.06058.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Pitfalls and Best Practices in Algorithm Configuration", "authors": ["Katharina Eggensperger", "Frank Hutter"], "emails": ["eggenspk@cs.uni-freiburg.de", "lindauer@cs.uni-freiburg.de", "fh@cs.uni-freiburg.de"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In order to obtain the peak performance of an algorithm, it is often necessary to optimize its parameters. Recently, the AI community has developed automated methods for configuring the algorithm (AC), which lead to a new performance (Hutter et al., 2009) to replace tedious, irreproducible and error-prone parameters. Some sample applications for which automatic methods are used include satisfaction solutions (Hutter et al., 2017), maximum satisfaction (Anso Tegui et al., 2016), planning (Chiarandini et al., 2008), mixed integrity programming (Hutter et al.), evolution algorithm algorithm algorithm."}, {"heading": "2 Background: Algorithm Configuration", "text": "The configuration problem of the algorithm can be briefly described as follows: Given an algorithm A that needs to be optimized (the so-called target algorithm), with parameter configuration space, a set of instances, and a cost metric c: \u044b \u00d7 \u0432 \u2192 R, you will find a configuration. A concrete example of this configuration problem would be to find a parameter that minimizes the cost metrics c across instances. (1) A concrete example of this configuration problem would be to find a parameter that configures a solver A for the propositional satisfaction problem (SAT) (such as glucose (Audemard & Simon, 2009) or lingeling (Biere, 2013) on a set of CNF instances (e.g. hardware or software verification instances) that minimizes the average runtime c. Another example would be to find a hyperparameter that sets an algorithm."}, {"heading": "2.1 Approaches for solving the AC problem", "text": "There are several quite different configurators to solve this AC problem. ParamILS (Hutter et al., 2009) uses local search in the configuration space and uses a race strategy to decide which of two configurations performs better without running both on all instances. SMAC (Hutter et al., 2011) and its distributed version dSMAC (Hutter et al., 2012) use probabilistic models of algorithm performance, so-called empirical performance models (Hutter et al., 2014), to guide the search for good configurations by extending Bayesian Optimization (Brochu et al., 2010)."}, {"heading": "2.2 The Role of the Target Algorithm Wrapper", "text": "As shown in Figure 1, configurators execute the target algorithm with instances-based configurations and measure the resulting costs. To be universally applicable, configurators must define an interface through which they evaluate the costs for the desired instance and determine the desired costs (e.g. runtime or solution costs). To prevent the algorithm from being optimized, this interface is usually introduced by a twist in the desired instance."}, {"heading": "3 Pitfalls and Best Practices Concerning Algorithm Execu-", "text": "In this and the next section, we will describe the pitfalls of algorithm configuration and their impact on existing benchmarks in algorithm configuration and configuration.

We will put ourselves in a position to get a grip on the way we move. (...) We will put ourselves in a position to understand the way we move. \"(...)\" We will move in the way we move in the way we move, the way we move. \"(...).\""}, {"heading": "4 Pitfalls and Best Practices Concerning Over-Tuning", "text": "A common problem when using overtuning configurations is the overtuning effect (Birattari, 2004; Hutter et al., 2007). Overtuning is closely related to the concept of overmatch in machine learning and refers to the phenomenon of finding parameter configurations that lead to a result.8 We note that in some modern Linux distributions, / tmp / can be a RAM disk and can therefore use resources allocated to algorithm runs; in general, we recommend choosing a fast temporary directory that is specific to the cluster used. 9This problem is fixed in later versions of UBCSAT.strong for the training task, but is not generalized to test tasks. To protect against overtuning effects, we recommend always evaluating generalization performance (typically using a set of benchmark instances that are coupled with the benchmarks used for training) in the following three."}, {"heading": "4.1 Pitfall 5: Over-tuning to Random Seeds", "text": "Many algorithms are randomized (e.g., SAT solvers or AI planners), but in many communities, the random seeds of these algorithms are fixed to simulate deterministic behavior and ensure the reproducibility of benchmark results. Effect Ignoring the stochasticity of an algorithm configuration by fixing the random seed can be over-tuning effects to this seed, i.e., finding a configuration that performs well with this fixed random seed but performs poorly when used with other random seed. The extreme case is not to repair the random seed, but to adjust the random seed, which can lead to an even stronger overtuning effect."}, {"heading": "4.2 Pitfall 6: Over-tuning to Training Instances", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to survive themselves, and that they are also able to survive themselves, \"he said.\" But it is not as if, \"he said.\" But it is as if, \"he said.\" But it is as if, \"he said.\" It is as if. \"\". \"\" It is as if. \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\". \"\". \"\". \"\". \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \".\". \".\" \"\". \".\" \".\". \".\" \"\". \".\". \"\" \".\" \".\". \"\" \".\". \".\". \".\" \"\". \".\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\". \"\". \"\". \".\" \".\" \"\" \".\". \".\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \".\". \"\". \".\". \".\" \".\" \"\". \".\" \".\". \".\" \"\". \".\". \"\". \".\" \"\". \".\" \".\" \".\". \"\". \".\" \"\". \".\" \"\" \".\". \".\". \"\". \"\". \".\" \"\". \".\". \".\" \"\". \"\". \".\" \".\". \"\" \".\". \"\" \".\" \".\". \"\" \".\" \".\". \"\" \".\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\". \"\". \"\" \".\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \".\" \".\" \"\". \".\" \"\". \"\". \"\". \"\". \".\" \"\" \".\". \".\" \".\". \"\" \"\" \".\". \".\". \".\" \"\". \".\". \"\" \""}, {"heading": "4.3 Pitfall 7: Over-tuning to a Particular Machine Type", "text": "In the age of cloud computing and mainframes, it is obvious to use these remote resources to configure them.
