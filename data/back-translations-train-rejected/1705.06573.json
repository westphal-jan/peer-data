Statistical Relational Learning", "text": "Extending machine learning to take into account the rich relationship structure of real problems is the goal of the emerging science of the SRL (see [6] for a comprehensive overview).Many different methods have been proposed, including Bayesian logic programs (BLP) [6], which is the SRL method selected for the present study. SRL methods describe a very broad class of probability density functions (PDFs) using a two-step representation, consisting of a structural part and a parametric part. The structural part is usually written in the language of first order logic, while the parametric part expresses the statistical meaning of the relational structure.An explicit representation of a PDFs, typically in the form of a Bayesian network or a Markov random field, is generated from the SRL models in response to a query, and this explicit PDFs representation is then used to calculate the response to the query, e.g. the probability that an event is observed."}, {"heading": "C.

Operative requirements for online stability in anomaly", "text": "The first is the probability of incorrectly detecting an anomaly in a normal situation, while the second is the probability of failing to detect an anomaly in an anomaly situation, and the second is the probability of failing to detect an anomaly in an anomaly situation. False is the same as False Positive Rate in machine learning, while Pmiss is the false Negative Rate. The anomaly detection system is only useful when Pfalze and Pmissed fall below the thresholds of Tfalse and Tmissed, respectively, where the thresholds depend on conditional operational requirements, and the system should be able to run online with reliable good performance between maintenance points. We assume here that the system runs unattended, except for regularly scheduled maintenance occasions, when an operator monitors the performance of the system and decides whether it is reliable."}, {"heading": "A.

A tentative rule of thumb for SRL online stability", "text": "Due to the great potential benefits of using SRL methods, it is tempting to ignore the lack of formal stability assurance and take a more reckless approach as outlined below. As the real statistical parameters will always vary under the effects of the accumulation of training samples, the durability of the \"digital\" clauses structure seems to be the best signature for stability. Therefore, the clauses structure should be monitored according to the following guidelines: 1) Perform the online learning process until the structure of the solution is stable for a period significantly longer than the maintenance interval. 2) Ensure that only minor structural improvements have occurred during the last few modifications of the solution."}, {"heading": "It is reasonable to assume that only small simpifications or specializations of the logical structure occurr as the SRL system converges to a bona fide solution.", "text": "3) Monitor lifespan (the number of new online training samples that a structure survives) Certify that the lifespan of successive structures increases as it can be assumed that this is a signature for approaching a valid solution. Our cautious rule of thumb is to accept the solution for operational use when all conditions 1-3 are met. Note that the requirement 2) for small structural changes is only used to check stability. Early learning phases can include major structural changes where the (unstable) system from the local minima.III. ANALYSIS OF ONLINE STABILTY IN A ONE EASY MODEL In order to better understand online stability in BLP and similar SRL concepts, we will discuss a greatly simplified model where stability problems are more tractable than in general SRL learning.
