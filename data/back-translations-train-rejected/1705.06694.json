BACKGROUND", "text": "A critical factor in interactions and relationships is empathy and emotional responsiveness, [4] because of its ability to recognize, understand, predict, and respond appropriately to the behavior of others. [5] If virtual people achieve a quality of interaction that is similar when they are not the same, the development of a convincing simulation of empathetic skills will be crucial. Haase and Tepper point out that both verbal and non-verbal references play an important role in establishing a sense of emotional responsibility."}, {"heading": "III. SYSTEM DESIGN", "text": "Here we describe the implementation of the virtual journalist. Let's start by explaining existing components and how we developed the virtual agent from the ARIA-VALUSPA project into a virtual journalist. We close this section with an example of a dialogue and how the pipeline processes the user input in this example. \"Alice\" was selected as an interviewer, taken from the ARIAVALUSPA project3. The agent understands spoken natural language and non-verbal behavior and uses both verbal and non-verbal behavior to talk to the users. Alice's visual appearance is shown in Figure 3."}, {"heading": "A. Preprocessing", "text": "Input is done first by implementing components from the Stanford Natural Language Parser (NLP) toolkit [13]. Specifically, we use the dependency parser and then the part of the language tag to determine the structure of the sentence. We identify terms as important because of their part of the language and their syntactical role within a sentence. We create nodes in a handmade knowledge base for important nodes within the sentence, such as the named units, proper names, and the subject. Additionally, we track the attributes that modify a node, assert ownership claims of a node, and the other names a node can refer to using a lightweight handmade anaphorical resolution. We also try to identify nodes that appear to be related based on frequent coexistence in the same context."}, {"heading": "B. Dialogue Manager", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "C. Output", "text": "After the agent's response was selected, Alice performed the behavior based on FML [18]. The FML could contain parameters such as where to apply a pitch accent or what emotionality the agent needs to show. These parameters can be loaded by the DM IS (e.g. the decision to mirror the user's emotion) or fixed in the FML files (e.g. a question that always shows \"surprise behavior\"). An example of a conversation with Alice is included in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "IV. EVALUATION OF THE AGENT", "text": "We conducted a two-step evaluation of our system, first on a user-to-assistant basis, then on a user-to-agent basis."}, {"heading": "A. Wizard of Oz Evaluation", "text": "In order to get an early indication of their applicability in the real world (e.g. what does an interviewer do and how does empathy play a role), an informal evaluation of the agent began during development using a semi-functional version operated by Wizard of Oz [19], [20] and the interactions were recorded and transcribed for analysis. A second goal of our assistant was to compile a list of generic questions that both elicited good follow-up conversations and were general enough to be used in different contexts."}, {"heading": "B. Agent Evaluation", "text": "Using this refined questionnaire, we conducted a series of interviews with 8 participants (5 male, 3 female). All of the agents \"responses were triggered by a human assistant hidden in a separate room with a list of possible answers, manually determining which one was best to use. Participants interacted with the assistant for about 5 minutes before completing a questionnaire with 16 questions after the test. The objective of the evaluation survey was to quantify the enjoyment and commitment of each user during the interaction, their perception of the naturalness of the interaction, as well as their prior knowledge and experience with virtual agents. The agents\" impressions were likeability, the depth of vocabulary, the quality of nonverbal expression (gestures, facial expressions, timing), the clarity of communication, general conversation skills and their empathic skills were also evaluated. Each metric was defined in the survey and rated on a scale from 0 to 5, ranging from very high to very low."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are people who are able to acquire their identity without being able to lose their identity."}, {"heading": "VI. FUTURE WORK", "text": "It was found that Alice failed to engage emotionally. There are a number of challenges associated with the development of agents who can convincingly simulate empathy and demonstrate emotional responsiveness. Indeed, Ochs, Pelachaud and Sadek [24] found that users experience agents who react in an incongruous emotional way, rather than agents who do not react emotionally at all. Although Alice was visually presented to users as human, it was clear to users that they lacked a deeper understanding of the information presented to them as a result of the limitations of the system. The agent's liking reflects that the character Alice was universally popular, but an anecdotal feedback from users who interacted with her that her open courtesy may have made her a slightly generic and unthinkable character."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "Promising first steps towards the development of an embodied virtual agent have been taken, and the agent has been able to use a range of information-enhancing strategies to achieve sustained interaction with a user. We argued that emotional engagement can be improved by enhancing the empathetic capabilities of the agent through the integration of automatic emotion recognition and social signalling software. Furthermore, machine learning techniques can automate the process of increasing the density of language templates. Finally, we suspect that users may find a less anthropomorphic agent with more memorable or unexpected personality traits to be more interesting and engaging."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors would like to thank Professor Michel Valstar and his ARIA-VALUSPA team for their access to their development tools and the organisers of the eNTERFACE workshop who made this project possible."}], "references": [{"title": "Talking voices : repetition, dialogue, and imagery in conversational discourse", "author": ["D.
