BACKGROUND OF ANFIS", "text": "ANFIS is a fuzzy inference system implemented within the framework of adaptive neural networks to facilitate learning and adaptation [16]. Neural networks are not ideal for depicting blur and uncertainty. However, in terms of fuzzy logic, determining fuzzy rules, input and output functions requires prior knowledge and cumbersome matching processes. However, by combining fuzzy logic and neural networking technology in ANFIS, it can fully exploit the learning capabilities of neural networks and the imprecise handling of fuzzy logic to overcome these weaknesses. ANFIS has been used in numerous areas, including the analysis of dissolved gases [17], the identification and monitoring of the brain-computer interface [18] and automatic gas cloud welding [19]."}, {"heading": "A. Architecture of ANFIS", "text": "The architecture of ANFIS is shown in Fig. 1. For simplicity, it is a Sugeno fuzzy model of the first order with two inputs and two if-then rules. Rule 1: If (x is A1) and (y is B1) then f1 = p1x + q1y + r1 Rule 2: If (x is A2) and (y is B2) then f2 = p2x + q2y + r2where x and y are inputs, fi are outputs, Ai and Bi are fuzzy sets. pi, qi and ri are the resulting parameters that are updated during the training process. In this figure, a square represents an adaptive node, while a circle represents a fixed node. As you can see, all nodes in layer 1 are adaptive nodes. Let the output of the ith node in layer n be north, i.e. the outputs of layer 1 are represented as the input belonging class."}, {"heading": "B. Learning algorithms of ANFIS", "text": "As discussed in the previous section, the premise parameters {ci, bi} in layer 1 and the resulting parameters {pi, qi, ri} in layer 4 are all changeable, the purpose of the ANFIS learning process is to adjust all these parameters so that the ANFIS output matches the training data. If the premise parameters are set, the final output can be displayed as: f = w = 1f1 + w = UK1 (p1x + q1y + r1) + w = 2 (p2x + q2y + r2) = (w = 1x) p1 + (w = 1y) q1 + (w = 1) q1 + (w = 2x) p2 + (w = 2y) q2 (7), which is a linear combination of the resulting parameters. Thus, the least square method can be used to calculate the optimal value for the resulting parameters."}, {"heading": "III. ANFIS-BASED AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM", "text": "The structure of the ANFIS-based implicit authentication system is illustrated in Fig. 2, which includes an activity monitoring module, a scoring module, a reference calculation module, and an ANFIS module. ANFIS \"learning capability enables the training of a specific fuzzy inference model based on predefined user input-output data without manual interference. Therefore, this trained fuzzy model depicts the user's behavior well and can then be used to make a final authentication decision to provide access controls. The use of the system can be divided into two phases: the training phase and the introduction phase. During the training phase, we use generated inputs (scores, references) and output (classification labels) variables to train ANFIS modules offline. Once the training is complete, the introductory phase begins, which allows the system to determine the authenticity of the current usability and authentication period."}, {"heading": "A. Workflow of ANFIS-based authentication system", "text": "The workflow of the proposed authentication system is illustrated in Fig. 2. It first models the user profile based on selected functions that are representative of individual behavior; the functions are divided into foreground and background activities; the background activities consist of events that the user cannot control, such as receiving SMS and phone calls; the foreground activities, on the other hand, consist of those that the user can initiate (e.g. making a phone call or surfing the Internet); the functions used to calculate AS- and background behavior in real time can be represented as follows: Features: (f1, f2, f3,..., fn), (b1, b2, b3,..., bm) A time window-based profiling method is used to calculate foreground and background activity in real time in order to obtain the anomaly of the current usage behavior (see section III, which is designed to quantify general user behavior)."}, {"heading": "B. Features used in ANFIS system", "text": "The proposed ANFIS-based authentication system uses representative features to model the user profile, and these features should be readily available and readily available from most mobile devices. Consequently, the following sources are considered to be features of our ANFIS-based authentication system. Experiments presented in this paper are based on these eight profile modeling features. (1) Incoming SMS 2) Outgoing SMS 3) Outgoing SMS 4) Outgoing SMS 5) Browser History 6) WIFI History 7) Application History These features are divided into foreground functions (screen status, app, outgoing SMS / calls) and background functions (WIFI, incoming SMS / calls) and are then used within the authentication scheme to generate foreground and background anomalies (using Equations 10 and 11) to quantify the authenticity of the current user."}, {"heading": "C. Generalized algorithm for maintaining a ranked list of occurred events within each feature category.", "text": "To ensure that the most relevant and current items within each functional category are fully utilized, we developed a generalized algorithm for maintaining a ranking. The main concept of the ranking is to quantify the meaning of each item in the related functional category. For example, if the user uses a specific application such as Twitter, the system should be able to know whether this is a commonly used application for the user, or how familiar this application is to the user compared to other applications. Our generalized algorithm is developed for this purpose. The algorithm is divided into two parts, which are part of the ranking maintenance and anomaly score calculation. The ranking maintenance part is presented in Equation 14 to determine its ranking or index in the ranking. Valij = {\u03b1i + \u03b2i \u00b7 occj, when itemj / rankListi is valid."}, {"heading": "D. Time window-based profiling", "text": "To achieve this goal, the status of the screen is used to record all activities performed by the user. That is, when the presence of the user is detected, the system tracks all foreground activities performed by the user and computes the foreground anomaly score gradually until the screen is turned off. The system then proceeds with reference calculation and ANFIS module to update, return and generate the authentication result. Whenever ASfore is recalculated and the system is in the initial phase, authentication is performed on the basis of new ASfore and current ASback taking into account the attenuation factor. The occurrence of background activities updates only the score of the associated functions and no authentication is performed. The main functionality of the timer (see Figure 2) is to control the maximum period of time that the system must wait to perform authentication if the user is active within the given time frame, which always forces the system to maintain security."}, {"heading": "E. Adaptive reference computation", "text": "As mentioned above, a reference is used as an ANFIS input variable in tandem with foreground and background anomalies, and the reference is calculated in a way that indicates the distributions or patterns of anomalous values. Therefore, the system can decide whether the current behavior deviates too much from previously perceived patterns by calculating the difference between the anomaly score and the reference. Thus, in order to generate dynamic reference that adapts to the drift of user behavior, we select exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA) and standard deviations (SD) as the main parts of our reference calculation scheme. Preliminary work such as [20] applying EWMA to recording control and buffer management \u2212 \u2212 has illustrated the power and efficiency of the algorithm. In EWMA, the coefficient \u03b1 represents the degree of weighting, so that a higher \u03b1 value discredits earlier observations (14.cAS) than the equation."}, {"heading": "F. The ANFIS classifier", "text": "The main functionality of ANFIS in our authentication system is to train a specific fuzzy inference model for each user based on their behavior through the ANFIS learning process and then provide real-time authentication based on given input variables when the training is completed. As previously mentioned, we use foreground / background anomalies and calculated references in coordination as ANFIS inputs. Thus, the selected ANFIS input variables are presented as follows (see Equation 13): \"Foreground anomaly score\" (ASfore) - the difference between foreground anomaly score and reference value (ARDfore) - \"Background anomaly score\" (ASback) - the difference between background anomaly score and reference value (ARDback) - while output data is divided into three categories: \"Output = 1\" shows legitimate user output = 0 shows user output = suspicious user outputs \"(ASback) - the difference between background anomaly score and reference value (ARDback) - while output data is divided into three categories:\" Output = 1 \"shows legitimate user output = 0 shows user outputs\" (ASback) - the difference between background anomaly score and reference value (ARDback) - the difference between background anomaly score and reference value (ARDback) - the foreground anomaly score (ASfore) - the difference between foreground anomaly score and reference value (ARDback) - the foreground anomaly score (ARDback) - the difference between foreground anomaly score and reference value (ARDback) - the foreground anomaly score (ARDback) - the difference between foreground anomaly score and reference value (ARDfore) - the difference between foreground anomaly score and reference value (ARDfore)."}, {"heading": "IV.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, an ANFIS-based continuous implicit authentication system for mobile devices was proposed and examined, using data collected over several weeks from mobile device users, with an Android app continuously monitoring 8 different activities (features) to collect data for our experiments presented in this thesis. Using its self-learning capabilities, an ANFIS-based system provides customized fuzzy inference systems for each user based on its collected behavioral data, eliminating the need for cumbersome manual tuning in traditional fuzzy-based systems. Experimental results presented showed that the ANFIS-based system achieved an average user detection rate of up to 95%, compared to a non-ANFIS-based system that recorded an average of 90% user detection rate. In future work, we intend to conduct further experiments by supplementing our real user data set with simulated data to enable a more independent evaluation on a larger user area."}], "references": [{"title": "Cracking Android pattern lock in five attempts.", "author": ["G.X.
