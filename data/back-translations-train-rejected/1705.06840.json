The assignment problem is a fundamental problem in both computer science and economics with application in many areas including task and resource allocation. We draw inspiration from multi-criteria decision making and voting and use order weighted averages (OWAs) to propose a novel and flexible class of algorithms for the assignment problem. We show an algorithm for finding a $\\Sigma$-OWA assignment in polynomial time, in contrast to the NP-hardness of finding an egalitarian assignment. Inspired by this setting we observe an interesting connection between our model and the classic proportional multi-winner election problem in social choice.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 00:51:53 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06840v1", "3 Figure"]], "COMMENTS": "3 Figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "authors": ["jing wu lian", "nicholas mattei", "renee noble", "toby walsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.06840"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.06840.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Conference Paper Assignment Problem: Using Order Weighted Averages to Assign Indivisible Goods", "authors": ["Jing Wu Lian", "Nicholas Mattei", "Renee Noble", "Toby Walsh"], "emails": ["renee.noble@data61.csiro.au,", "lianjingwu@gmail.com", "n.mattei@ibm.com", "toby.walsh@data61.csiro.au"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The assignment of indivisible elements to multiple agents is a fundamental problem in many areas, including computer science, economics and operations research.

The information in Garg et.al. may be incorrect or out of date - none of the authors worked for EasyChair, nor did they have access to the EasyChair code.\" We do not assume that% i is complete; it is possible that some agents have conflicts of interest or have no preference for a particular object; this assumption is often referred to as \"having unacceptable objects,\" in the literature [26].

Object capacity: Every object assigned to j has an upper and lower limit (possibly all the same) in terms of the number of agents assigned to it, cOmin (j) and c O max (j).

Note that the pairwise comparison relationship is transitive. An assignment is optimal with respect to pairwise comparisons if there is no other assignment that each agent weakly prefers and strictly prefers at least one agent. Lemma 1. Consider an agent i and two equally large assignments S and T. If S is then preferred with respect to pairwise comparisons at least as much as T is preferred with i, then S will yield at least as much OWA value as T for each OWA vector, whether it increases or decreases. Note that S can be considered a transformation of T in which each item j is replaced by a different item that is at least as preferred. Therefore, the value of the item either remains the same or increases. In both cases, the corresponding agent is multiplied by the OWA value."}, {"heading": "5 An Algorithm for \u03a3 -OWA assignments", "text": "In this proof, we use the most general formulations of our problem, using the values of the upper and lower pro-agent capacities, which can be different for each object. We reduce our problem to the problem of finding a minimum of feasible costs in a diagram with higher and lower capacities on the edges, which is a polynomial problem. Furthermore, we know that the flow is integral as long as all edge capacities are integral, even if we have real value-added costs [2]."}, {"heading": "5.1 Generalizations", "text": "We observe two possible generalizations of the above construction that allow us to use this constructive evidence for more general cases than the WA. Firstly, the above evidence can be generalized in such a way that \u03b1 can vary for each agent. Specifically, it should be noted that the decision nodes for each agent ai are independent of all other agents, meaning that we could use an OWA vector \u03b1ai for each agent (or class of agents). This ability can be useful, for example, if a group of agents report the same extreme distribution of benefits and the organizer does the same transformation to these uses.The second generalization we can make for the above construction is to allow each agent to assign to each object more than once. While this ability makes no sense in the reviewers / papers (unless there are sub-reviewers), there may be other capacitated assignment settings in which we wish to assign agents multiple jobs, e.g. if there are discrepancies."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "We need to answer that question, and we need to get involved in the discussion about the MD-00002-000003 that the algorithms we gave us in Section 5 with networkX for Python and Lemon for C + +. However, we still have a runtime of O (V 4) that gives us runtime (1502 \u00b7 3) 4), which has caused our computers to crash with 16GB of memory, which was quite disappointing as we were able to use the flow argument to address this problem in real world instances.Not to be deterred, we wanted to examine the allocations we get from utilitarianism and egalitarian allocations."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "We have proposed and provided algorithms for the novel idea of an \u03a3 -OWA allocation. \u03a3 -OWA allocation using decreasing OWA vectors gives the central organizer a \"slider\" to move from maximizing benefit to a more computationally efficient package with greater maximum allocation. An important open question for future work is the search for axiomatic characterizations for good OWA vectors. Furthermore, the OWA method and all the methods we have studied treat CPAP objects as beneficial. Generally, reviewers at a conference want to review less, not more, work. Consequently, it would be interesting to examine CPAP from the perspective of housework as it is called in the economic literature."}], "references": [{"title": "The New York City high school match", "author": ["A.
