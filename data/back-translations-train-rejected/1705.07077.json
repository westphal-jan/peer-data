Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is not as if one can go in search of what exists in the world as one imagines it to be. But, when one imagines in the bedroom, one must draw attention to oneself in order to grasp other objects and their spatial entanglements. It is only necessary to describe the characteristics of the cat. It is not as if one cares about what exists around the cat, as it is unnecessary. But, when one adapts in the bedroom, one may have to draw the attention that one directs to other objects and their spatial entanglements. It is not as if one observes the distance and greater distances, as if one is in the mountains and rivers. And it is susceptible to resolution and atmospheric refraction. The fine-grained information of the object, which leads to the contrasts contrasts contrasts contrasts contrasts of the natural scene, is difficult."}, {"heading": "2. Construction of Experimental Dataset", "text": "The quality of the training dataset is an important factor that facilitates the performance of the model (Xiao, Hays et al. 2010, Yu, Seff et al. 2015).The superior remote sensing dataset not only refers to large data, but can also contain a wide variety of semantic information (Handa, Patraucean et al. 2015).As is particularly emphasized, we analyze the impact of network depth and the scale of the receptive field from the perspective of scene complexity. For this reason, we select AID (Xia, Hu et al. 2016) based on existing remote sensing datasets, and then sort out 22 categories of scenes where the complexity is more distinguishable than our basic dataset (Figure 1).The dataset contains 360 samples per class; each sample has a size of 600 x 600 RGB images, noting that in order to balance image size and hardware boundaries, we adjust the original image to 25x-6."}, {"heading": "Categories Mean Mode frequency Guide by", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where you feel you can go to the top without being able to go to the top."}, {"heading": "4. How Does Network Scale Changes Influence Scene Semantic Understanding?", "text": "Remote sensing scenes with large scales and objects in the scene are more ambitious (Wu andLi 2009, Blaschke 2010).Therefore, for the semantic understanding of the remote sensing scene, it is important to capture the overall characteristics (Benz, Hofmann et al. 2004, Zhang, Xia et al. 2015).Several classes share objects, e.g. dense residential and central scenes, and both contain streets and buildings; the difference between them is mainly reflected in the architectural style.This semantic difference among similar contents becomes a challenge in understanding the remote sensing scene, where learning the overall characteristics of the model and the spatial distribution pattern between objects is required; therefore, it is necessary to take this multi-scale characteristic into account (Figure 5).We analyze the influence of the scale factors on DCNN in the remote sensing scene. The experimental results show that learning the characteristics of multiple scales is useful in the process of detecting the scene."}, {"heading": "Filter concatenation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Previous layer", "text": "Experimental results show that the DCNN-based remote sensing of scenes requires multiple scale characteristics, and the characteristics of each scale are not sufficient to represent all the semantic information of the scene. Differences in the representation capability of different scale characteristics for the remote sensing scene exist simultaneously, and a larger scale of a feature has greater expressiveness. Table 5 shows the detection result of the different scale beginnings embedded in the networks. GoogleNet's multi-scale model has a Kappa value higher than other one-scale models. The Receive-5 model with a large convolution core scale works best in single-scale models; the smallest 1-1 model detection has the worst pitfalls. Therefore, it can be deduced that remote sensing of scenes depends on the characteristics of multiple scales, which largely adapt to large-scale scenes."}, {"heading": "5.

Discussion and Future Work", "text": "Our work is inspired by the temporal and spatial imbalance of attention, which is able to understand the scene, and focuses on exploring the depth and scale of the model in the task of remote sensing scenes from the perspective of scene complexity. A visualisation method is used for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the mechanism of remote sensing of scenes. The main conclusions are as follows: 1. Remote sensing of scenes of different complexity depends on different network depths and sales characteristics. This means that a complex scenario concept represents the representation of multiple scales and level characteristics, there is an implicit correlation between complexity and characteristics. Complex scenes rely on the representation of multiple and shared semantic support of multiple goals. We show that multiple models outperform each other individual network; and experiments based on CAM indicate that the distribution of combing targets play an important role in the learning mechanism."}], "references": [{"title": "Multiresolution, object-oriented fuzzy analysis of remote sensing data for GIS-ready information.\" International Journal of Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing", "author": ["U.C.

Compared with the natural image, the scale of remote sensing image is larger and the scene and the object it represents are more macroscopic. This study inquires whether remote sensing scene and natural scene recognitions differ and raises the following questions: What are the key factors in remote sensing scene recognition? Is the DCNN recognition mechanism centered on object recognition still applicable to the scenarios of remote sensing scene understanding? We performed several experiments to explore the influence of the DCNN structure and the scale of remote sensing scene understanding from the perspective of scene complexity. Our experiment shows that understanding a complex scene depends on an in-depth network and multiple-scale perception. Using a visualization method, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the recognition mechanism in a complex remote sensing scene and demonstrate the importance of multi-objective joint semantic support.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2016"}}}
