If gases and liquids flow simultaneously in a pipe, the two phases can be distributed in a variety of flow configurations, with different flow configurations resulting in different flow properties."}, {"heading": "2 Materials and Methods", "text": "The concept of deep learning stems from research on artificial neural networks. Unlike the neural networks of the past, modern methods of deep learning have cracked the code for training stability, generalization and scaling on big data. They are often the algorithm of choice for highest predictive accuracy because they work well in a number of different problems. There are several types of learning machines for deep learning. In our research, we use a forward-facing neural network known as multilayer perceptron (MLP), a forward-facing neural network consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer consists of small units that receive the input signals X as neurons in the input layer and transmit them to the rest of the network. In subsequent layers, each neuron receives a signal that is a weighted sum of the results of the nodes in the previous layer, and a constant term referred to as bias."}, {"heading": "2.1 Dataset", "text": "An experimental database of flow patterns was established [PTM + 12], which consists of the most relevant studies developed in this area. Specifically, for this study, the data set of Shoham [Sho] was selected for its large number of data points (5676), the inclination angle (\u2212 90 \u0445 to 90 \u043c), two pipe diameters (ID = 1in and 2in) and the wide range of flow patterns observed for all pipe inclination angles. The flow patterns considered in this study are: Annular (A), Bubble (B), Dispersed Bubble (DB), Intermittent (I), Stratified smooth (SS) and Stratified welly (SW). The intermittent flow patterns considered in this study include Slug (SL) and Churn (CH) flow patterns combined [PTM + 12]. To analyze the performance of the algorithm, three tests are proposed: Test includes all proposed flow patterns (Slug + ST) and Churn (ST)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Supervised Classification of Flow Pattern Using Machine Learning", "text": "In supervised learning, we assume that each element of the study is represented as an n-component vector-weighted random variable (X1, X2,.., Xn), with each Xi representing an attribute or attribute; the space of all possible attribute vectors is referred to as input space X. We also consider a set of {y1, y2,.., yk} corresponding to the k possible classes; this forms the output space Y. A classifier or learning algorithm typically receives a set of training examples from a source domain T = (x, y), where x = (x1, x2,.., xn) is a vector in the input space, and y-R k is a value in the (discrete) output space. We assume that the training or source sample T consists of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) examples distributed according to a fixed but unknown common probability distribution, P (x, in the input space) or output space."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "In our approach, we trained an MLP on a set of randomly selected patterns, about 60% of the entire data set was used for training, about 20% was used for validation, and about 20% was used as a test set for the 3 different tests. Using the multi-layer perceptron, we can descend with simple stochastic gradients [Bot10]. Table 1 shows our chosen multi-layer perceptron architecture and parameters that are used in our experiments. Other design considerations include the choice of ReLU as our nonlinear activation function, the 1 and 2 regulatory penalties to avoid, the number of eras, and nfolds, the number of cross-validation folds folds. In evaluating the effectiveness of our deep learning methodology, the confusion matrix is an important metric."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we proposed three types of data sets as input characteristics and investigated the use of deep learning for classification and prediction of two-phase currents, based on experimental data from [PTM + 12, Sho]. We proposed six types of input characteristics and a corresponding architecture for precise prediction of flow patterns. First, we showed that the network can learn surprisingly well because our chosen architecture and parameters allow us to achieve high classification accuracy. Second, we showed that the network can classify the different flow patterns with high efficiency. Finally, we achieved high precision in predicting different class combinations. Our experiments suggest that a deep learning approach has the potential to detect flow patterns, which can increase classification performance. In future studies, these investigations could be further improved by conducting more comprehensive searches for the parameters in the architectures [Deep Learning approach has the potential to detect flow patterns, thus improving the overall performance of these systems]."}], "references": [{"title": "and Viraj Parmar", "author": ["Anisha Arora", "Arno Candel", "Jessica Lanford", "Erin LeDell"], "venue": "Deep Learning with H2O,", "citeRegEx": "ACL15", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2015}, {"title": "Artificial neural network application for multiphase flow patterns detection: A new approach", "author": ["Mustafa Al-Naser", "Moustafa Elshafei", "Abdelsalam Al-Sarkhi"], "venue": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 145:548\u2013564,", "citeRegEx": "ANEAS16", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2016}, {"title": "In Proceedings of COMPSTAT\u20192010", "author": ["L\u00e9on Bottou.
