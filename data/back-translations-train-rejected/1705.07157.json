The typical idea is to design a clustering algorithm that outputs a near-optimal solution, provided the data satisfy a natural stability notion. For example, Bilu and Linial (2010) and Awasthi et al. (2012) presented algorithms that output near-optimal solutions, assuming the optimal solution is preserved under small perturbations to the input distances. A drawback to this approach is that the algorithms are often explicitly built according to the stability assumption and give no guarantees in the worst case; indeed, several recent algorithms output arbitrarily bad solutions even when just a small section of the data does not satisfy the given stability notion.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 19:30:33 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07157v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["maria-florina balcan", "colin white"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07157"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.07157.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Clustering under Local Stability: Bridging the Gap between Worst-Case and Beyond Worst-Case Analysis", "authors": ["Maria-Florina Balcan", "Colin White"], "emails": ["ninamf@cs.cmu.edu,", "crwhite@cs.cmu.edu."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Our algorithms are natural modifications of existing, state-of-the-art approximation algorithms.

The underlying goal is to group a certain number of points in order to maximize similarity within a group and minimize similarity between groups. However, a common approach to clustering is to establish an objective function and then roughly find the optimal solution according to the target. Given a set of points S and a distance measurement value d, common clustering goals can include searching for the sum of the distance or square distance from each point to its closest center (k-median and k-mean), or minimizing the maximum distance from one point to its closest center (k-center). These popular objective functions are demonstrably difficult to optimize [23, 28, 32] so that research focuses on the search for approximation algorithms."}, {"heading": "1.1 Our results and techniques", "text": "We present algorithms that simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art approach rates in the worst case scenario, while exposing us to optimum resistance when the data is stable. All of our algorithms are natural modifications to existing approach algorithms. To answer the question (2), we define the notion of local perturbation resistance in Section 2. This is the first definition to be applied to an individual cluster, rather than to the dataset as a whole. Informally, an optimal cluster satisfies the satisfaction of local perturbations if it remains in the optimal solution for input interference. We show that any optimal cluster1 trivial solution runs an approximation algorithm and a BWCA algorithm in parallel, and the output of the better of the two solutions. We seek a more satisfactory and \"natural\" answer to this question."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related work", "text": "The first constant factor approximation algorithm for k-median was given by Charikar et al.

We define local resistance to disturbance, a property of a single optimal cluster and not of the instance as a whole. We specify algorithms that simultaneously provide guarantees for the worst case as well as guarantees in case the data is stable. Specifically, we show that local search produces the optimal (3 +) LPR clusters for k-median and the (9 +) LPR clusters for k-median. For k-center, we show that every 2-approximation produces the optimal 2-LPR clusters, as well as the optimal (3,) -LPR clusters when the optimal clusters are not too small. We offer a natural modification of the asymmetric k-center approximation algorithm of Vishwanathan [38] to prove that it produces all 2-SLPR clusters. Finally, we show the APX hardness of general cluster formation > -approximation conditions for all other stabilization conditions > -approximation conditions."}, {"heading": "A Prior algorithms in the context of local stability", "text": "In this section, we will discuss previous algorithms in the context of our new local stability structure. All of these results are useful under the standard definition of public relations resilience. [However, all of these results are under the standard definition of public relations resilience for which they were designed.] However, we will see that the previous algorithms (except for those designed specifically for the k-Center) use the global structure of the data that causes the algorithms to behave badly when a fraction of the datasets are not resistant to interference. [3] In order to optimize the minimal resilience of the algorithms for all center-based objectives, we need to intuitively describe the dynamic means and means of the algorithms. The first step is to create a minimum of tree-T on the dataset, and the second step is to perform dynamic programming on T to find the lowest cost."}, {"heading": "B Proofs from Section 2", "text": "In this section we give a proof for Lemma 6.

"year": 2017, "abstractText": "Recently, there has been substantial interest in clustering research that takes a beyond worst-case approach to the analysis of algorithms. The typical idea is to design a clustering algorithm that outputs a near-optimal solution, provided the data satisfy a natural stability notion. For example, Bilu and Linial (2010) and Awasthi et al. (2012) presented algorithms that output near-optimal solutions, assuming the optimal solution is preserved under small perturbations to the input distances. A drawback to this approach is that the algorithms are often explicitly built according to the stability assumption and give no guarantees in the worst case; indeed, several recent algorithms output arbitrarily bad solutions even when just a small section of the data does not satisfy the given stability notion. In this work, we address this concern in two ways. First, we provide algorithms that inherit the worst-case guarantees of clustering approximation algorithms, while simultaneously guaranteeing nearoptimal solutions when the data is stable. Our algorithms are natural modifications to existing state-ofthe-art approximation algorithms. Second, we initiate the study of local stability, which is a property of a single optimal cluster rather than an entire optimal solution. We show our algorithms output all optimal clusters which satisfy stability locally. Specifically, we achieve strong positive results in our local framework under recent stability notions including metric perturbation resilience (Angelidakis et al. 2017) and robust perturbation resilience (Balcan and Liang 2012) for the k-median, k-means, and symmetric/asymmetric k-center objectives. \u2217Authors\u2019 addresses: ninamf@cs.cmu.edu, crwhite@cs.cmu.edu.
