Language-dependent part: the lexicon.

Choose programming languages that have a long history (at least 10 years), with more than one stable implementation. 3.

Here are some key differences: 1. Whenever a relationship can be defined as a reflective temporary closure (RTC) of another relationship, instead of defining it manually as in Coq, we now use HOL's Builtin RelationTheory to define it and get the associated theorems. 2.

The equivalance between these systems are formally proved. Finally, a formalization of Sequent Calculus proofs (where Coq has built-in supports) has been designed and implemented in HOL4. Some basic results including the subformula properties of the so-called \u201ccut-free\u201d proofs are formally proved.
