However, there are many areas where solving a reduced model is still prohibitively expensive. In fact, for complex areas such as those used in IPPC [Bryce and Buffet, 2008], we are introducing a planner that already leads to regulations and k = 0 leading to major problems that can be solved in a practical way. To solve this problem, we are introducing a planner that combines the flexibility of the reduced model framework with the efficiency of a classical planner. We call this planner FF-LAO * because it is an extension of the LAO * algorithms [Hansen and Zilberstein, 2001], which implements the FF-classical planners to Computation.FF-LAO * (algorithms 1-4) receives as input an Mk1 reduction, S \u2032 S \u2032, A, T, C \u2032 C, 0, G (G)."}, {"heading": "4 Choosing a Good Determinization", "text": "Many stochastic domains are a great example of a domain where all kinds of domains can be captured that are much more effective than others. Consider, for example, the triangle Tireworld domain [Little and Thiebaux, 2007]. Although the agent must reach one of the vertices in a planar diagram of the triangular shape, but after each step there is the possibility of getting a flat tire (see Figure 1), if this happens, he must get a spare tire before he can move again. However, spare parts are only available in certain places, and there is only one way from start to finish, so that all places in the path have spare parts. This domain has two possible determinations, depending on whether a flat tire is moving or not. As it turns out, it is possible to get the optimal policy for this problem by planning if a flat tire will always occur. The interesting part is that this applies to all instances of this problem, regardless of size."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where we will be able to put ourselves at the top, in the way we have done in the past: in the way we have done it, and in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it. \""}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we presented a new perspective on the use of the provision for probabilistic planning, showing that a careful selection of identification methods can exceed the efficiency of state-of-the-art planners. We also presented a new planner, FF-LAO *, which uses the power of classical planning algorithms for calculation efficiency in choosing the determination, but can also argue probabilistically if necessary. We proposed a strategy for selecting a determination that exploits the inherent structure of a given stochastic area. We show that choosing the determination can generalize problems of different sizes, especially in terms of their impact on planning performance (probability of success and expected costs). We compared our approach with modern planners for goal-oriented probability problems, using a set of benchmarks from the International Probabilistic Planning Competition. Our results strongly support the assertion that choosing the provision can lead to significant increases in planning."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgment", "text": "This work was partially supported by the NSF-Scholarship No. 1524797."}], "references": [{"title": "Mathematics of Operations Research", "author": ["Dimitri P.
