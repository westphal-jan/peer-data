The cohort included patients with a variety of ICD-9 codes and medical conditions, including leukemia, high blood pressure, sepsis, abdominal, pneumonia, and kidney failure. Each patient record in the dataset is linked to the time-varying and static information listed in Table 1 as to whether the time-varying physiological measurements are collected over irregularly matched time intervals of ICD patients (typically between 1 and 4 hours) who were treated in the clinic with 27 physiological patients we have access to the time-were in the clinic."}, {"heading": "3 The Proposed Individualized Risk Score", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Notations and Definitions", "text": "Let Xi (t) = [Xi1 (t), Xi2 (t),.., XiD (t) T be a D-dimensional stochastic process representing the time varying D-physiological currents for the patient i.
