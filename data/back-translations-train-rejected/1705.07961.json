(c) This general result results in blurred versions of some important extension theorems for blurred relations (Szpilrajn, Hansson and Suzumura). (c) The notion of a consistent conclusion of a blurred relationship [3] is generalized to blurred relations by two constructions: R-and R-shaped generalizations (R-shaped theorems).
