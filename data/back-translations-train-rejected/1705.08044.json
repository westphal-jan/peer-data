Specifically, as explained in the previous section, four symbol intervals of 250 ms, 334 ms, 380 ms and 500 ms are considered to be the results used in data rates of 2 to 4 bits per second (bps). For each symbol interval, random bit sequences of length 120 are used, with each of the 100 transmissions separated at times, resulting in 12k bits per symbol interval used for training and testing. From the data, 84 transmissions per symbol interval (10,080 bits) are used for training and 16 transmissions used for testing (1,920 bits). Therefore, the total number of training bits used for testing is 40,320, and the total number of bits used for testing is 7,680.We start by using the detection rate of the change in pH."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "These algorithms have a lot of potential in systems where the underlying physical models of the channel are unknown or inaccurate. For example, molecular communication, which has many potential applications in medicine, is very difficult to model with detectable analytical models. We are using an experimental platform that simulates chemical communication within a container to collect experimental data for training and testing deep learning algorithms. We are showing that deep learning sequence detectors can significantly improve detection performance compared to a basic approach that is also not based on channel models. This shows the promising performance that deep learning detection algorithms may have in designing future communication systems. Some interesting open problems that we would like to investigate in the future are: First, we want to perform more parameter tuning to find better neural networks for detection. Another important problem that we want to investigate is how quickly learning systems will be able to change the concentration of detectors, for example, if the network becomes resilient to alep systems."}], "references": [{"title": "Underwater acoustic communication channels: Propagation models and statistical characterization", "author": ["M.
