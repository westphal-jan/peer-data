This social media data includes a great wealth of information 1https: / / twitter.com 2 https: / / facebook.com / 3 https: / / www.instagram.com and gives us the ability to explore hidden patterns or unknown correlations and understand people's satisfaction with what they are discussing for different topics. While much of this social media data is publicly available, it remains difficult to analyze the data to mince the useful information. Consider a scenario. A user wants to understand that within different categories (i.e., food, transportation, technology, and sports) the most popular topics that people discuss online are."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "This work is inspired and refers to several groups of research activities that allow the user to learn more about their tweets and discuss them briefly. Twitter Data Analysis Tools. There are a few tools that are available for analyzing social networking data for different application scenarios. Keyhole5 offers an extensive set of tweet visualizations that illustrate metrics in an easy-to-read graph and layouts for keywords, account summaries and so on. It offers a variety of dashboards to display results according to user input Tweet visualizations as a search term. Tweet Sentiment Visualization6 is an analytics application that is designed to explore ways to visualize sentiments for unstructured and also non-grammatical tweets. It provides a comprehensive set of sentiment visualization techniques that use searched keywords to analyze the mood behind each tweet that is associated with the analytics Twitter is developing."}, {"heading": "3 TwiInsight System and Algorithm Design", "text": "In this section, we will first present the problem under investigation and an overview of the system architecture, followed by an introduction to data collection. We will also present all developed algorithms for mood analysis, topic extraction and correlated topic detection, followed by the visualization discussion."}, {"heading": "3.1 Problem and System Architecture Overview", "text": "To solve this problem, we propose an automatic solution, which is achieved by analyzing the social media data. To present the idea, we introduce TwiInsight, a system designed to discover the visibility of the Twitter data. Although TwiInsight is developed using the Twitter data, it can be easily expanded to analyze different social media data sources. Figure 1 provides an overview of the system architecture of TwiInsight. The system consists of three main components, including data collection, data analysis and data visualization. The data collection module is designed to search Twitter's tweets using data crawlers and store the tweets in the MongoDB, a NoSQL database for scalability and less data storage. After receiving the tweets, the system mainly performs three different analyses in order to better answer the following questions: What topics help us understand the related information to help us understand it?"}, {"heading": "3.2 Data Collection", "text": "To present the idea, we focus on English tweets, selecting five categories: Food, Healthcare, Sports, Technology, and Transportation. Note that the system can be easily expanded to apply different crawlers that search for tweets in different languages and categories. Data crawlers are developed using Twitter4J, a Java library for the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) that can easily integrate data crawlers with Twitter services. For each category, we have collected 50 or more popular hashtags that are used to search the corresponding tweets. A hashtag is a convention among Twitter users to create and track a discussion thread by adding a \"#\" character to a word. Table 1 provides some sample hashtags that are used in the system."}, {"heading": "3.3 Topic Extraction", "text": "To understand the topics that people discuss on each tweet, TwiInsight uses Skyttle's keyword analysis techniques. Topic modeling is sometimes referred to as keyword extraction, term extraction, or keyword analysis. It is done by finding a single word or phrase that describes the most important terms and entities mentioned in the tweets. To enrich the study, we develop and evaluate three different algorithms to extract the topics of each tweet. These algorithms are developed on the basis of different models: (1) Skyttle8 (2) Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) [18] and (3) GATE Part-Of-Speech Tagger9. To improve the topic of modeling performance, we first clean the data by removing all usernames and URLs. The first topic-based algorithms we developed are based on the Skyttle extraction program that we base on the text we base on."}, {"heading": "3.4 People Opinion Analysis", "text": "In order to understand people's opinion or satisfaction with certain topics, TwiInsight uses sentiment analysis technology that enables automated analysis of whether the text is positive, neutral or negative. Three algorithms are developed in this paper to extract the sentiments of each tweet based on different models: (1) StanfordCoreNLP [21] (2) Haven OnDemand11 and (3) Monkeylearn12.11 https: / / www.havenondemand.com 12 http: / / monkeylearn.comAll the stopwords, usernames and URLs are removed before the tweet is passed on to all three approaches. Stanford CoreNLP-based algorithm tasks are performed. The first program we developed to analyze the tweet sentiments is based on StanfordCoreNLP. Stanford CoreNLP is a Java library of natural language analysis tools Stanford CoreNLP can integrate speech, including many NLP tools."}, {"heading": "3.5 Topic Correlation Detection", "text": "To identify patterns or trends in the topics that often occur in common over time, TwiInsight uses a Java program to detect topic correlations that runs through all topics and builds a matrix based on their frequency. As the matrix of incidence captures topic relationships, it uses the semantic information on topics that occur in the Tweet Collection. incidental information can be used to recommend topics or identify the top topics. By its very nature, a popular topic is strongly associated with all topics. To solve this problem, it is important to calculate the discriminatory power of a particular topic to give \"weight\" to the topics. For example, if topic A is discussed 45 times with a rare topic B (which has only been discussed in 100 tweets) and 120 times with a popular topic C (which has been discussed in 12,000 tweets), topic B should be more relevant than topic C. In order to \"weigh\" the topics, a feature has been introduced that ranks this topic in the context of highest weighting."}, {"heading": "3.6 Data Visualization", "text": "To facilitate intuitive information exploration, TwiInsight uses multiple data visualizations for users. After data analysis, the system displays all the results via a web GUI. Here, we briefly present the most important visualizations that the system supports. Figure 6 shows the stacked bar with all the aggregated sentiment values for each category, with the blue, green and red part representing the percentage of positive, neutral and negative tweets. Meanwhile, the user can filter the data based on various dimensions such as time and location. When the user hovers the mouse over the stacked bar, he displays detailed mood values. The right panel can dynamically show all the topics extracted under the respective topic as soon as the user clicks on the bar on the left. The system also allows the user to view all tweets that relate to a topic by simply clicking on the topics shown in Figure 7. To help users extract the topics used in each category, like Insight to pick up the topics used in each Insight 8."}, {"heading": "4 Performance Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we present a performance assessment for mood analysis and theme extraction algorithms based on real-world data collected by Twitter. All experiments are performed on a Windows server running a 64-bit Windows 10 Home with an Intel (R) Core (TM) m3-6Y30 1.51GHz processor and 8GB of RAM."}, {"heading": "4.1 Sentiment Analysis Algorithms Comparison", "text": "There is a lot of discussion about how well the sentiment analysis has been performed and the different techniques it measures. Sentiment analysis is considered a subjective task, it is not only difficult for an algorithm to calculate it, but also for humans. If different people mark their respective sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, negative) for 1,000 tweets, they most likely do not match the sentiment result for most of these tweets. It can vary a lot for human agreement on the sentiment result of a tweet due to the subjective nature of the sentiment analysis. We believe that there is no sentiment analysis that achieves 100% accuracy, but it is still useful when trying to get a macro-level sense of the mood of a topic or a number of topics from tweets. # RT [homemade] The biggest taco I have ever done # food https: / / t.co / idoblnQsC Positive Chicken Hand # RT Positive."}, {"heading": "4.2 Topic Modelling", "text": "As with the sentiment analysis evaluation, twenty participants took part in this evaluation. They received one tweet and three sets of topics extracted from the three algorithms. You must select the best topics from among the three themes and, on average, determine which algorithm produces the best result. Table 3 shows the number of participants who selected the topics of this algorithm as the best example for each tweet. Note that due to the space limitation, we do not fully compare all the results of topic modeling. For each tweet with the highest number of participants, this means that the algorithm produces the best result. From the evaluation, we found that for 80% of the twenty tweets tested, the GATE Twitter POS-based algorithm was rated as the best algorithm. And for 20% of the tweets, the Skyttle-based algorithm was rated as the best. And RAKE-based algorithm was not rated as the best in any of the tweets. This part shows that the GATE-based algorithm is the worst."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "While social media platforms contain a wealth of information, it remains difficult to analyze it for different applications. In this post, we introduced TwiInsight, a system that integrates different technological ways of discovering Twitter data. TwiInsight allows a data acquisition module to search online tweets in real time under different categories. It further analyzes tweets to automatically detect themes, sensations and related topics over time, and uses different visualizations after information integration. In addition, we evaluated and compared multiple algorithms for each analytical component for different design decisions and decisions."}], "references": [{"title": "Why we twitter: understanding microblogging usage and communities", "author": ["A.
