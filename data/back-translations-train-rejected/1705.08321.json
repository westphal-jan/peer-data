Key objectives of the study and its significance", "text": "Over the past two decades, bioscience articles have become much more complex, reflecting technological evolution, particularly the experiments of OMICs, increasing collaboration between multiple institutions, and the inclusion of more advanced mathematics and statistics applied to data. In many publications, plain unstructured text is supported by algorithms, code, and multiple files of processed and raw data sets with annotated metadata and graphics. Recently, the entire field of \"meta-analysis\" has evolved to describe \"dry laboratory studies\" to normalize, unify, and analyze many similar data sets derived from different labs and projects."}, {"heading": "2. State of the art in the field of biomedical texts semanticization", "text": "However, there is no solid solution for biomedical markup that combines all the latest advances in each area in a single package. A current limitation is the lack of a single scheme for the life sciences. Previous related initiatives include W3C Schollar HTML [11] and JATS4R [12], but both schemes do not provide a common denominator for the life sciences."}, {"heading": "3.

Discussion", "text": "This paper is the first in our series of researchers on the precise semantic labeling of texts from the life sciences. Our goal was to focus on the dependence of the influence of the paper on two fundamental factors: ambiguity and variability of terms. In order to avoid excessive complications, we have made several assumptions that can distort the results. These simplifications are taken into account in subsequent studies: 1. Previous precision estimation is calculated on the assumption that the probability of obtaining a paper with a concept is calculated: in the search for ambiguous terms, it may have a uniform distribution. In fact, it has a nonlinear distribution as shown in Tables 1, 2 and 2. Previous estimation is calculated on the assumption that the probability of retrieving a paper with a concept may have a uniform distribution."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.
