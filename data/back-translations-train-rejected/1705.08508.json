Problem Description", "text": "Suppose v is equipped with a position sensor. Coordinates include latitude and longitude. Specifically, the data of the sensor include the following fields: (vehicle ID, time, latitude, longitude), in which the vehicle ID uniquely identifies a vehicle. Metropolis is marked as a rectangle, which is uniquely characterized by its maximum width, minimum width, maximum length and minimum length. The rectangle is divided into small blocks with a size of l \u00b7 l (e.g. 50m x 50m), which results in a series of blocks characterized by a series of blocks. The advantages of dividing the map into blocks are twofold, namely map independent (applicable to all metropolises) and cover exactly the entire map (as opposed to circles). Our goal is to find a subset of blocks C to place (super) cameras so that the security service can be maximized so that we can select the number of blocks we can afford the least cameras."}, {"heading": "B. Placement Strategies", "text": "For all strategies we refer to the objective function of F (C) Vehicle. 1) S1 - Maximum Unique Vehicles (Vehicle Unique Vehicles): This strategy selects a subset of C (Vehicle Unique Vehicles) so that the number of Unique Vehicles (Vehicle Unique Vehicles) is so high that the number of Unique Vehicles (Vehicle Unique Vehicles) is so high that the number of Unique Vehicles (Vehicle Unique Vehicles) is so high that it maximizes the amount of vehicle traffic (rather than unique vehicles) that blocks in C. Likewise, it isargmax C F (Vehicle Unique Vehicle) Vehicle (Vehicle Vehicle Vehicle) is so high that the total number of vehicles (such as cameras) Vehicle (such as cameras) is possible"}, {"heading": "C. Solving Optimal Placement Strategies", "text": "All of the above strategies are formulated as maximization problems, which are added under the constraint \"C | \u2264 N.\" To find a subset of blocks, we must place cameras so that F (C) can be maximized, we must intentionally solve these maximization problems, the NP hard.Each strategy differs in the objective function F (C). However, this does not necessarily mean that we must solve these strategies in five different manners. Instead, all of these maximization problems can be solved with a greedy algorithm (GA) due to their non-increasing monotony and submodularity. (Non-increasing monotony means that for two sets of C1, C2 and C1 C2 we have a high resolution F (C1) \u2264 F (C2). Apparently, the functions defined in S1 and S5 are not decreasing. Submodularity means that a non-decreasing function does not have a decreasing function."}, {"heading": "A. A Game-theoretic Formulation", "text": "Since the different blocks differ in their priorities to be monitored, or are the target blocks where criminal activity is committed, we take into account the importance of different blocks when designing the randomized strategy. Meanwhile, the enemy aims to evade surveillance by high-resolution cameras while the defender (e.g. the police) attempts to observe the opponent. To describe such a confrontation, we use the Stackelberg Security Game (SSG) to design the strategy [7]. SSG is well suited to the hostile argument regarding the allocation of security resources and has been used in many applications, such as the US Federal Air Marshal Service [8]. A standard SSG has two players, a leader and a follower. Each player has their own strategies to choose from. The leader and the successor act sequentially as follows. Step 1. The leader (i.e. defender) commits to a mixed strategy. The mixed strategy allows the leader to play a distribution of probabilities over pure strategies."}, {"heading": "B. Player Strategies", "text": "A pure strategy of the defender is a series of cameras, the resolution of which can be increased simultaneously. Our goal is to deter the opponent by increasing the resolution of the set-up cameras randomly, so that the opponent who commits crimes in blocks without cameras is not taken into account. Therefore, a pure strategy of the opponent is a series of blocks with set-up cameras."}, {"heading": "C. Utility Functions", "text": "(Consider that the opponent commits crimes in the ith block. If ci is covered by the pure strategy of the defender, the defender receives a reward Rdi. Otherwise, the defender receives a penalty Pdi. Likewise, the opponent receives a penalty Pai in the first case and a reward R a i in the second case. The reward that the defender monitors a particular block can be assigned according to the importance of the block, such as the amount of vehicle traffic, the number of unique vehicles and the severity of historical crime activity, etc. The penalty that the opponent selects a block can be measured in the same way. Let J specify the number of pure strategies of the defender, and Ai j denotes the coverage indicator of the number of crimes on ci, where Ai j = 1 for improving the performance and Ai j = 0 for the performance of the defender. Let J be the number of pure strategies of the defender (the number of pure strategies of the opponent is the maximum number of cameras to be placed in)."}, {"heading": "D. Mixed Strategy against A Best Response Adversary", "text": "We formally define the objective function with limitations in order to maximize the benefit of the defender against an opponent with the best reaction. First, let's consider a highly developed opponent who takes the best response, i.e. selects the block to commit crimes to maximize its benefit. In this case, the probability that the opponent chooses ci equalsBi = {1 Uai (xi) \u2265 Uaj (x j) is greater than 1,...., J 0 otherwise (10) This means that the opponent knows the marginal probability that the defender can improve ci and he chooses the target with the maximum expected benefit. Consequently, the usefulness functions of the opponent and the defender can be expressed asUa = N \u00b2 i = 1 BiUd = N \u00b2 i = 1 BiUdi = 1 (12) at the same time the defender chooses an optimal mixed (i.e. randomized) strategy taking into account the logical response of the opponent."}, {"heading": "A. Dataset Description", "text": "The data includes week-long GPS trajectories of 10,357 taxis in Beijing with more than 15 million position records and 9 million kilometers of total trajectory distance [10]. We remove the outliers along a vehicle's GPS trajectories, including points indicating an impossible speed and points that deviate significantly from the moving average. Finally, we identify 0.28% of all GPS points as outliers. We then divide Beijing into blocks measuring 50 x 50 meters, giving the total number of such blocks."}, {"heading": "B.

A Case Study of Randomized Resolution Upgrading", "text": "To demonstrate the performance of the randomized resolution based on the game theory, we consider a security surveillance scenario in which N = 10,000 cameras are placed, whereas only 1,000 cameras could be of high resolution. Suppose the surveillance focuses on criminal (or terrorist) activities that tend to be carried out in places generally equipped with more vehicle traffic (to have more serious consequences), we consider that the defender and the opponent are playing a zero-sum game, that is, the gain (or loss) of the benefit is exactly offset by the loss (or gain) of the benefit of the other player (s). Formally, we set Rdi + P a = 0, R a i + P d = 0. Obviously, we have Ud + Ua = 0."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Customizing Security Surveillance", "text": "Different types of vehicles require different monitoring priorities. Compared to individual cars, taxis (as a public space) and school buses generally require higher monitoring priorities. Although we do not differentiate between different types of vehicles, each vehicle v can be assigned a personal weight indicating its monitoring priority, with greater values of weight indicating higher monitoring priorities. It is also possible to assign weight values to vehicles, which can be derived from social data such as accident statistics and the criminal records of vehicle owners. Vehicles with more accident statistics or whose owners have more criminal records would have higher weights.The weight wv can be used directly as a multiplier of parameters in the proposed strategies. For example, Iv (C) could be replaced by wvIv (C), and the same applies to TV (C), Hv (C) and Uv (C). This maintains the non-decreasing submodular ownership of F (C)."}, {"heading": "B.
