ESTIMATION OF TRAVEL TIME IN PEDESTRIAN MODE", "text": "Pedestrian navigation in all native map apps on major smartphone platforms uses the na\u00efve approach. Once the destination (and starting point, which is usually the user's current location) is determined and the navigation process starts, the apps use GPS at regular intervals (every few seconds) to find the user and calculate the distance between the current location and destination. Based on these calculations, the apps update the estimated travel time. In other words, for all users in the same place, the travel time to the same destination is identical in existing map apps on the same platform, meaning that the apps do not take into account differences between users (gender, age, walking speed, etc.). Although available data can be used to provide more realistic and personalized travel times, they are not used in all popular navigation apps in all smartphone operating systems. By collecting individual movement profile data, it is possible to improve modern predictive analysis methods to provide personalized pedestrian navigation services, to make use of this tracking data for pedestrians easier."}, {"heading": "3.1 Accuracy of Prediction of Travel Time", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "4. PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS FOR IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF PREDICTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Dataset", "text": "In the aforementioned experiment, we collected some other attributes (or functions in machine learning terminology) for each trip and participant in addition to the actual travel time and estimated travel time. Interestingly, the data set of the experiment illustrates the changes in movement behavior based on different attributes. Most participants had different travel time for the same routes (and directions) at a different time on the same days or different days. It appears that combinations of environmental and time factors cause different walking speed and thus differ between travel time for the same person for the same route. Apart from environmental and time factors, differences between different travel time of different participants are high with individuals that relate to running characteristics such as average walking speed and the total length of the journey during the same day.The data set for predictive analysis includes attributes for the temporal and environmental measurements of a particular route for a particular person. The data set consists of four types of characteristics such as age, gender, sum of travel duration for the current day."}, {"heading": "4.2 Predictive Analytics with All Features", "text": "In fact, we are able to go in search of a solution that is capable of finding a solution that meets the needs of the individual."}, {"heading": "4.3 Predictive Analytics with Less Private Data", "text": "As mentioned in the previous section, gender and, to a certain extent, age are important characteristics in predicting the correction value. This section illustrates the change in the accuracy of the prediction based on all data without age and gender characteristics. The following figure shows the prediction accuracy of the same methods in the previous section. The results show that the prediction accuracy of all methods is reduced. On average, there is a 3.5% decrease in the prediction accuracy and the prediction accuracy of the Random Forest decreased by 5%. This shows the adequate predictiveness of age and gender (especially gender) in predicting the correction value. The following figure shows the importance of the characteristics of Random Forest.The order of the characteristics is similar to Figure 10. Compared to Figure 10, the importance of the length of the route, the altitude change and the weather situation increases. This means that without the private information (gender and age) the prediction method depends more strongly on the other characteristics with high accuracy."}, {"heading": "4.4 Predictive Analytics without Elevation Data", "text": "In contrast, the estimated travel time in both directions of the same route is not identical. In reality, the estimated travel time in both directions of the same route should not be identical. To investigate the effect of the elevation change in predicting the correction value, we trained the same models on the full dataset without age, sex and elevation change (Figure 13). Figure 13 is very similar to Figure 11, and to capture the meaning in Figure 14, Figure 11 is, there are very small changes in the prediction accuracy of different models."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we evaluated the pedestrian mode of navigation apps in iOS, Android and Windows Phone platforms. In this context, we investigated that neither the map app in iOS, Android and Windows Phone, nor commercial online map services take into account the walkability of footpaths in routing algorithms (at least in the case area covered by this study).This issue is related to data quality and can be solved in various ways; from using crowd sourcing data such as OpenStreetMap to using artificial intelligence to automatically detect the type and location of pedestrian crossings using Street View services. Estimating pedestrian travel time is an important aspect of navigation services that, in their current form, can cause several hours of delays in multimodal journeys."}, {"heading": "6.
