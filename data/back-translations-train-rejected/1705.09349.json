There is a sign saying that one of the two roads leads to prosperity, another to death. The agent must take the fork in the road, but it does not know which road leads to where. Does the agent have a strategy to get to prosperity? Since one of the two roads leads to prosperity, such a strategy clearly exists. We call this fact by the modal formula Sap, where statement p is a claim to future prosperity. Furthermore, agent a knows that such a strategy exists. We write this as KaSap. But the agent does not know what the strategy is and therefore does not know how to apply the strategy. We call this per \u00ac Hap, where the know-how modality Ha expresses the fact that agent a knows how to reach the goal based on the information available to it. In this article we examine the interplay between modality K, which represents knowledge, modality S, which represents the existence of a strategy, and modality, which represents the existence of a know-how strategy."}, {"heading": "1.1 Epistemic Transition Systems", "text": "In this article, we use epistemic transition systems to capture knowledge and strategic behavior.

In this article we look at knowledge, strategies and know-how strategies of coalitions. There are several forms of group knowledge that have already been studied before, the two most popular of which are general knowledge and distributed knowledge [8]. Different contexts require different forms of group knowledge. As in the famous problem of the two generals [4, 11], where communication channels between the actors are unreliable, the creation of common knowledge between the actors might be indispensable for a strategy. In some contexts, the distinction between general and distributed knowledge is meaningless. For example, if members of a political group share all their information and develop a common strategy, then the shared knowledge of the members becomes the common knowledge of the group during the face-to-face meeting. Finally, in some other situations, the distributed knowledge makes more sense than the general knowledge."}, {"heading": "1.5 Nondeterministic Transitions", "text": "Take the transitional system T7 shown in Figure 7. In this system, there are two agents a and b who can choose either C or D. If both agents choose C, then the system takes one of the consensus transitions designated by C. Otherwise, the system takes the transition with D. Note that there are two consensus transitions emanating from state u. Therefore, even if they choose C, both agents have no strategy to achieve p, i.e. u 1 Sa, bp. However, they can reach p-q. Since all agents can distinguish all states, we have u-Ha, b (p-q)."}, {"heading": "1.6 Universal Principles", "text": "In the above examples, we focus on specific characteristics that have either been fulfilled or not satisfied in certain states of the epistemic transition system T1 to T7.
