Rentfrow and Gosling [14] conducted an online survey and showed the correlations between music preferences and personality, self-assessment (e.g. wealthy and politically liberal), and cognitive skills (e.g. verbal skills and analytical skills).

Let lun = (u, a, do) denote the n-th game log of u-U. Specifically, user u plays a song by the artist a-A in due course. Here, A is the group of artists in the record. Without loss of generality, we assume that game logs are sorted in ascending order of their timestamps: do < do \u2032 for n < n \u2032. To capture the user's listening settings over time, we divide the user's game logs into sessions. Following Zheleva et al. [18] and Baur et al. [2] we use the time gap approach to generate sessions. If the gap between do and do + 1 is less than 30 minutes, lun and lun + 1 belong to the same session; if they belong to different sessions, let u = the 3rd session."}, {"heading": "3.2 Session Model", "text": "The model proposed by Zheleva et al. [18], called the session model, is a probabilistic graphical model based on the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) [1], which assumes that for each session there is a latent theme (e.g. rock or love song) that guides the selection of songs in the session. Figure 1 (a) shows the graphical model of the session model, in which shaded and unshaded circles represent observed or unobserved variables. In Figure K, the number of topics is mainly the number of minutes in the third session of u, \u03b8 the distribution of user topics and \u03c6 the distribution of topics artists.

[18] have demonstrated the usefulness of creating songs played on the basis of the theme of a session, we assume that users can select a song regardless of the theme. In such an addiction mode, we assume that the user directly selects a song without falling in love with a theme. In light of the above, our model accepts both theme and addiction-based song selections. Figure 1 (b) shows the graphical model of our proposed model. Each user has a Bernoulli distribution that controls the weight of influence for a session theme and addiction. To be more precise, when user u selects a song in a session, we assume that the choice is more likely to be influenced by the session theme."}, {"heading": "4 Inference", "text": "To learn the parameters of our proposed model, we use the following parameters: (1), (2), (2), (2), (3), (3), (3), (4), (4), (4), (4), (4), (4), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5), (5)."}, {"heading": "5 Quantitative Experiments", "text": "In this section, we answer the following research question, based on our quantitative experimental results: Is the adoption of two factors that determine consumers \"daily music tastes and dependence on artists effective in modelling music listening behavior?"}, {"heading": "5.1 Dataset", "text": "To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed two sets of data: the first was created from music playback logs from a music download service in Japan; the second consisted of logs on Last.fm. To ensure repeatability, we used a publicly available music playback log on Last.fm provided by Schedl [16]. Similar to JPD, we extracted 10 weeks of log data between 1 / 1 / 2013 and 11 / 3 / 2013; we call the data set LFMD. From the 10 weeks of JPD data, we created two pairs of training and test data sets as follows. In the first / second set, the training data set LFD consists of logs from the first four / eight weeks and the test data sets WPD from the next two weeks."}, {"heading": "5.2 Settings", "text": "In terms of hyperparameters, we use \u03b1 = 1K and \u03b2 = 50 | A | in the session model and in the session model with dependence (SWA) in accordance with other thematic modeling work. In addition, we use \u03b3 = 50 | A | and \u03c1 = 0.5 in the SWA model. To compare the performance of the session model and the SWA model, we use the confusion of the two models. Perplexity is a widely used measure to compare the performance of statistical models [1], and the lower value represents the better performance. The perplexity of each model on the test data is indicated by: Perplexity (Dtest) = exp \u2212 [1] u-U-Rtestu r = 1-V test j = 1 p (aurj). u-U-Rtestu r = 1 | V-test ur |, (8) where Rtestu and V-test ur represent the number of u sessions and the number of protocols in the first session of test data in the test data."}, {"heading": "5.3 Results", "text": "Figure 2 shows the confusion for each dataset. In each dataset, regardless of the amount of training data and number of topics, the SWA model exceeds the session model. If we set the number of topics to more than 300, the session model could exceed the SWA model; but we set the maximum value of K to 300 for the following two reasons, the first being the hours spent on the learning process. For example, if the session model learns parameters for K = 300 using 8WJPD, it takes 9.8 times longer than the SWA model for K = 30 using 8WJPD (1713 minutes for the session model and 175 minutes for the SWA model). In data analysis, elapsed hours are an important factor; if it takes a long time to learn the parameters for a model, the model is unsuitable for data analysis. The second reason is the comprehensibility of the topics. If the number of topics becomes too large, it is difficult to understand the difference between the topics, the topic is useless for us."}, {"heading": "6 Qualitative Experiments", "text": "In this section, we report on the qualitative analysis results in terms of user characteristics, performer characteristics and topic characteristics. Due to the space limitation, we show the results for the training data of 8WJPD only with K = 30. We not only analyze the music listening behavior of people, but also discuss how we can apply the analysis results."}, {"heading": "6.1 User Characteristics", "text": "As we mentioned in Section 3.3, each user has a parameter that controls the degree of common taste in music and addiction when selecting songs. Considering a user u, we can get the ratio of these two factors from Equation (7), where addiction places the greatest emphasis on artists (ratio > 0.9) The result, where so many users are somewhere between these two extremes of behavior, further indicates the usefulness of taking addiction behavior into account in listening to music. By using the posterior distribution of latent variables in Equation (4) and (5), we can analyze the relationship between the degree of addiction and time."}, {"heading": "6.2 Artist Characteristics", "text": "Just as in Section 6.1 given to an artist, we can add up p (x = 0) and p (x = 1) of all artist logs to determine the strength of common taste or addiction over time, and then normalize their sum to 1 to calculate the ratio of each factor of the artist. Figure 3 (b) shows a histogram based on the degree of addiction. It is noted that most artists have a high level of addiction, and from these results we can estimate whether the artist's songs are played repeatedly by users who are avid admirers of the artist, or by various users who listen to the artist's songs with songs by other artists. We also believe that the results could be used as one of the features to calculate the similarity between artists by assuming that similar artists have similar levels of addiction."}, {"heading": "6.3 Topic Characteristics", "text": "Finally, we show that our model can also be used for theme analysis. In view of a theme k, we collected representative artists in the category. To be more precise, the top 20 artists in terms of \u03c6k were extracted. For each of the 20 artists, we collected all the logs in the training data and calculated the ratio of taste in music and addiction as described in Section 6.1. Then, we calculated the averages of each degree over 20 artists and normalized their total to 1. Figure 5 shows the ratio of 30 topics in which the topics are sorted in ascending order of addiction ratio. As you can see, the ratio between two factors differs greatly from topic to topic: the addiction ratio ranged from 0.297 (10th topic) to 0.620 (17th topic). As for the topics with low addiction, the 10th topic has the lowest value of 0.297. This topic is related to songs created by using VOCALOID [9], the popular song synthesizer theme software theme is the lowest in Japan, with 2892 songs being related to the lowest in Japan."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a probabilistic model for analyzing people's listening behavior that takes into account the user's usual musical taste and dependence on artists. Our experimental results based on real-world music game protocols showed that our model exceeded an existing model that only takes into account the user's taste for helplessness. In our qualitative experiments, we demonstrated the usefulness of our model in various aspects: time-dependent game protocol analysis (e.g. the level of addiction is high early in the morning and on weekdays), theme-based game protocol analysis (e.g. the level of addiction is low for an anime song theme), and so on. For future work, we are interested in applying the knowledge gained from the log analysis to applications such as calculating the similarity of artists and song recommendations, as in Section 6. We are also interested in extending our model by considering the temporal transition of addiction."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partially supported by ACCEL, JST."}], "references": [{"title": "Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels", "author": ["E.M.
