(With this notation, therefore, V (xi: xh) would be the same as V (yi: xh) to match the case of complementation of xi, and V (yi: yh) to match the case of complementation of xi and xh.

However, if a general 0-1 optimization method is used to solve the QUBO problem, these inequalities can be recorded for later addition to the problem constraints. However, for our current purposes, and in the event that a special algorithm is used to solve the QUBO problem, these inequalities can be exploited by determining a correspondingly large value of M and weighting one of the terms xixh or yixh or xiyh or yiyh by - M. In particular, the inequalities observed in Kochenberger et al. (2004) can be handled as follows. For xi + xh \u2264 1: replace dih and dhi by - M.For xi xh: replace ch by - M and replace ch by - M (and dih = 1)."}, {"heading": "3.1.5 Comparisons of Basic Rules in combination to yield additional implications", "text": "We must exclude all combinations in which dih > 0 in one rule and dih < 0 in the other. < BO + > BO + > 1 then. Therefore, the rules for xi + xh 1 and xi + xh \u2264 1 cannot match the rules for xi \u2264 xh and xh \u2264 xh. All other combinations work to give either xi + xh = 1 or xi = xh, as shown next. In all cases, we assume that neither rule 1.0 nor rule 2.0 assigns a value to a variable.

Rules for Assigning Values to Pairs of Variables", "text": "The rules for assigning values to pairs of variables are more complex than the preceding rules and require a more elaborate logic to justify them. We again specify the associated lower limits on M, which return the result specified by each rule, according to the substitutions specified in Section 3.1.4, without the need to justify these limits. However, in this case, it is sufficient to limit M only to the inequality associated with the rule, and the stronger result that dominates the inequality by assigning specific values to xi and xh will apply automatically. We emphasize that the reference to M is not relevant in these cases, since the assignment of specific values to xi and xxi xh removes these variables from further consideration. However, for sensitivity analysis purposes it may be useful to know permissible values for M that can produce the results of these rules. In any case, we assume that Rule 1.0 and Ruxi 2.0 were first applied, and neither the conclusion can be assigned to xxi, xxi or xxi."}, {"heading": "5.
