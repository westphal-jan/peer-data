INTRODUCTIONNowadays, the dissemination of the accessible data stream takes place over various networks such as radio, website, mobile phone, etc. The large volume and continuous updating of data streams in real-time is a challenge for study and mining. The focus of this work is the profiling of the normal behavior of data generated by a digital video transmission system (DVB). From a provider's point of view, such a profile provides insight into the process that generates the data, and it can be used to detect anomalies."}, {"heading": "A. Digital Video Broadcasting system", "text": "The DVB standard defines both physical and data connection levels for a variety of subsystems, such as satellite, cable, terrestrial television and microwave. In addition, the DVB standard defines how several program data in the format of the MPEG Transport Stream (MPEG-TS) are distributed and transported between the protocols. Readers are referred to the official website of the DVB project for more detailed specifications. The aim of our research is a central security component of the DVB, i.e. the control access system. Figure 1 shows how the control access system works from the customer side. The TS is received by the satellite via the tuner and reaches the DVB descrambler. The contents of the TS are encrypted with a 48-bit secret key, also known as the control key (CW). The CW is further encrypted to an entity control message (ECM). Meanwhile, a ValtEG management (EMC message) decrypts the EMM cards."}, {"heading": "B. Related Work", "text": "Anomalies are usually considered outliers, surprises, exceptions, sounds and novelties [2]. Anomaly detection can be achieved by many pattern recognition techniques, but in many areas, such as medical and financial, fraud or anomaly detection should be understandable and interpretable. A major reason for this is that the knowledge learned should be validated by humans before use. We offer a brief literature review of anomaly detection with language models, as they are one of the most comprehensible models. Lin and al. represent time series with the symbolic aggregate Ximation (SAX) [3], and then use a context-free sequence to generate rules. Intuitively, anomalies tend to have low grammar density."}, {"heading": "II. DATA DESCRIPTION", "text": "An encryption schema sequence (ESS) is abstracted from the MPEG-TS monitoring recordings. It is essentially a discrete event sequence of ECM streaming in the control access system.The ESS alphabet is {A, B, 0, 1}. Symbols A and B stand abstractly for two ECMs, each containing an even key and an odd key. Symbols 0 and 1 are even and odd encryption modes. According to experts, some well-known rules are the following: 1) An ESS begins with As, followed by 1s, Bs, then ends with 0s. A complete encryption scheme consists of two aforementioned sequences. 2) The number of symbols is not specified in an ESS. However, the amount of As is always equal to that of Bs. Likewise, the paired events of 1s and 0.We can use a simple regular expression to generate the above-mentioned rules: (A {1} {1} {2} coupling pairs {n} coupling and {n} coupling {n coupling), whereby the coupling is one of both pairs and 0.We can use a simple regular expression to generate the above-mentioned rules."}, {"heading": "III. METHODS AND RESULTS", "text": "In this section we will use a language model, i.e. a time-controlled automaton for detecting anomalies. Time-controlled automata explicitly model the underlying behavior of different durations of ESS streaming."}, {"heading": "A. RTI+", "text": "An algorithm for efficiently learning the time-controlled automation algorithm called RTI + (an, tn), where ai is a discrete event occurring with ti time delay since the i \u2212 1st event.

All states are represented by circles; the arcs represent transitions between states; a transition is triggered if both an event and its timing are valid (within a timekeeper); the event and timing are printed together with their probability and occurrence next to the arc; the sink state called S is generated by some strings with a very low occurrence (less than 5); some interesting insights are discovered in such a revealing and structural model.1) Loops indicate the cyclic behavior when sending ESSs. For example, the path S0-S1-S2-S3-S4-S5-... S4-S5 can be expressed as: (A {3} 1 {2} B {3} 0 {2} properties 0 {2} +. 2) Excluding the time information, the legitimate rule (A {3-6} {-3} -bar."}, {"heading": "C. result", "text": "The training set contains a total of 280 sequences. In the test phrase we collect two sets of data with a data loss and a timing error, respectively. The number of sequences in each of them is 29. Abnormal items in a sequence are reported if such a sequence is not accepted by this model. Tables II and III show the results of data losses and time delay tests (data set). True positive (TP), false negative (FN), false positive (FP) and true negative (TN) are listed in the tables. Their corresponding rates i.e., TPR, FNR, FPR, TNR and Accuracy (ACC) are calculated as well. We compare three levels of magnification 10, 103 and 106 to determine the good time accuracy. The results show that precision with 106 times scaling works best. We propose to solve this problem by comparing attempts in practice. The false positive state is treated by the training Sink state, although we do not cause this problem in our RTI i.e."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "Such a generative model provides insights into the writing process of ESS. The knowledge we discover matches that of experts in the DVB system area. In addition, our model provides the valid timing for each transition to verify the duration of the behavior. Experiments show that our model has a high accuracy in detecting anomalies. Another advantage of our model is that it is efficient for real-time applications, as verification only triggers transitions in our model, which is polynomial over time."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This work is partially supported by the STW VENI project 13136 (MANTA) and the NWO project 62001628 (LEMMA)."}], "references": [{"title": "On the detection of card-sharing traffic through wavelet analysis and support vector machines", "author": ["F.
