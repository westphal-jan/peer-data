The system identifies the most salient keywords in a news article and ranks them based on both their overall popularity and their direct relevance to the article. The system also uses a supervised regression model to identify headlines that are likely to be widely shared on social media. The user interface is designed to simplify and speed the editor's decision process on the composition of the headline. As such, the tool provides an efficient way to combine the benefits of automated predictors of engagement and search-engine optimization (SEO) with human judgments of overall headline quality.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 17:40:58 GMT  (3092kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09656v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.HC cs.IR", "authors": ["terrence szymanski", "claudia orellana-rodriguez", "mark t keane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09656"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.09656.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Helping News Editors Write Better Headlines: A Recommender to Improve the Keyword Contents & Shareability of News Headlines", "authors": ["Terrence Szymanski", "Claudia Orellana-Rodriguez", "Mark T.

In the online sphere, headlines are expected to fulfill several new functions; for example, that the content of the article is presented in different online contexts, or that the article is optimized for news agencies (i.e, SEO). In fact, the headline is more important than ever, since it is the only visible part of the article in microblogs, and the listing of news agencies takes place."}, {"heading": "2 Design and Behavior", "text": "From the user interface perspective, the software has two operating modes: input mode and analysis mode. Input mode (illustrated in Figure 1) facilitates the entry of a news article and its corresponding headline and caption, which can either be entered manually or selected from a feed of current articles. In practice, this feed would be integrated into the newspaper workflow so that an editor could check all new articles using the software before publication. After the publisher user selects an article, the system switches to analysis mode and displays the results of the automated analysis (illustrated in Figure 2). This mode is designed so that the user can quickly assess the strengths and weaknesses of the headline and decide whether changes should be made to improve it. The five most ranked keywords from the article are listed on the right side of the screen, sorted by weight, a metric combination of the frequency of the general keyword in the article and its relevance for each SEO, as well as the local relevance of the article itself."}, {"heading": "3 Implementation", "text": "The system consists of three main components: a user interface frontend, a text analysis backend, and a web server that facilitates communication between the two. It is implemented with HTML and JavaScript and invoked via a web browser; its behavior is described and illustrated in the previous paragraph.The web server is implemented in Python (based on the Flask framework), allowing easy integration with the text analysis backend, which is also predominantly implemented in Python.We use the sklearn regression module and Stanford's CoreNLP Java suite for NLP [Manning et al., 2014].The entire system is provided on a web server and invoked by the customer's web browser.The backend consists of two components - keyword analysis and shareability analysis - which work independently and are discussed in detail below."}, {"heading": "3.1 Keyword Analysis", "text": "The role of keyword analysis is to identify terms in the article body that are good candidates for inclusion in the headline. \"We believe that headlines that contain informative and popular keywords can be more attractive to readers as well as prominent users,\" the headline says. \"The processing of an input article begins with tokenization and the frequency of Irish news articles in recent years, which we have equipped with data provided to us by two other Irish news projects. [Shi et al., 2014] This process leads to a list of entities that may be unique and a list of keywords that are known to have been encountered in previous news articles."}, {"heading": "3.2 Shareability Analysis", "text": "The role of sharing analysis is to identify headlines that are likely to be shared on social media. With the rise of social media as news distribution channels, headlines must now be both informative and \"divisible\"; that is, the headline must somehow entice people to post, share and engage with the article on social media in order to reach a large online audience. According to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report [Newman et al., 2016], Facebook and Twitter generate 54% of visits to online news sites, suggesting that direct visits to news providers \"homepages are being displaced by social media, access to Facebook and Twitter is known to have a very different audience and engage users in different ways."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "The tool was developed in collaboration with The Irish Times, and several professional keyword editors have tested its ease of use = Keyword Analysis n.64 Feedback from these sessions has been positive and has informed several design features. In particular, the color coding and font size features of the user interface have been noted for their ease of use. Based on this success, we are now looking for integration into the daily workflow of editors to allow more usability data to be collected.Recent tests of the system have identified some potential areas for improvement. The keyword system is often not detected when pairs of equivalent but not identical keywords have the same reference; for example Taioseach and Enda Kenny, or GPO and General Post Office. While editors can easily detect this duplication, this error affects the frequency of keyword rankings. This type of co-reference resolution is an open question in NLP research, with typical solutions that could be based on a rule-based or gazette-based approach to repairing frequently."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we have introduced a system for recommending keywords for inclusion in newspaper headlines and for identifying headlines with high shareability potential on social media. It identifies plausible keywords that are relevant to the given news article as well as generally popular in past news articles in order to maximize both the reader interest and the SEO aspect of the headline. In addition, the system identifies headlines that are likely to experience above-average engagement on social media, allowing editors to effectively align their social media strategy. We believe that this tool can be a helpful component in modern, online-oriented newsrooms."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank the Irish Times for funding and support for this project, which is supported by Science Foundation Ireland through the Insight Centre for Data Analytics under grant number SFI / 12 / RC / 2289."}], "references": [{"title": "Domain-independent term extraction through domain modelling", "author": ["G.
