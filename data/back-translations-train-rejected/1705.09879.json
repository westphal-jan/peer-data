In particular, assuming a set of leading diagnoses being given, we show how queries (sets of measurements) can be computed and optimized along two dimensions: expected number of queries and cost per query. By means of a suitable decoupling of two optimizations and a clever search space reduction the computations are done without any inference engine calls. For the full search space, we give a method requiring only a polynomial number of inferences and guaranteeing query properties existing methods cannot provide. Evaluation results using real-world problems indicate that the new method computes (virtually) optimal queries instantly independently of the size and complexity of the considered diagnosis problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 May 2017 00:47:29 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09879v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["patrick rodler", "wolfgang schmid", "konstantin schekotihin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09879"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.09879.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Inexpensive Cost-Optimized Measurement Proposal for Sequential Model-Based Diagnosis", "authors": ["Patrick Rodler", "Wolfgang Schmid", "Konstantin Schekotihin"], "emails": ["firstname.lastname@aau.at"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, the majority of them will be able to feel as if they were able to move, as if they were able to move, and that they would be able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move"}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section we review important MBD concepts and drag us to definitions of [Re-ar] -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) -S (*) S (*) S (*) S * S (* S) S (* S) (S) (S) * S (S) * S (S) (S) (S * S) -S (S) (S) (* S) -S (S) -S (* S) (S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S (* S) -S (* S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S (* S) -S (* S) -S (* S (* S) -S) -S (* S (* S (* S) -S) -S (* S (* S (* S) -S) -S (* S)."}, {"heading": "3 Query Optimization for Sequential MBD", "text": "The (Q-) partition PD (Q) allows both to verify whether a candidate Q is actually a query and to estimate the impact of Q's results in terms of diagnostic validation.

In particular, we allow a query to be optimized along two dimensions, i.e. number of queries and cost per query. We show that the optimizations of these properties can be decoupled and viewed in order. For an appropriately limited (still exponential) query search space (very close to) global optima, predetermined quel quality scales can be found in negligible time for diagnostic problems of any size and complexity without invoking an inference engine (taking into account the pre-calculation of \u2265 2 diagnoses is feasible). For example, query search scales up to a size of 3 million can be immediately processed (< 0.1 for the total search space within reasonable 4)."}], "references": [{"title": "and P Patel-Schneider", "author": ["F Baader", "D Calvanese", "D McGuinness", "D Nardi"], "venue": "(eds.).
