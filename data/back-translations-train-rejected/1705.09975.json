The emergence of the Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) and context-aware technologies boost a growing interest in analysing, extracting and eventually understanding city events which subsequently can be utilised to leverage the citizen observations of their cities. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using Twitter textual streams for extracting city events. We propose a hierarchical multi-view deep learning approach to contextualise citizen observations of various city systems and services. Our goal has been to build a flexible architecture that can learn representations useful for tasks, thus avoiding excessive task-specific feature engineering. We apply our approach on a real-world dataset consisting of event reports and tweets of over four months from San Francisco Bay Area dataset and additional datasets collected from London. The results of our evaluations show that our proposed solution outperforms the existing models and can be used for extracting city related events with an averaged accuracy of 81% over all classes. To further evaluate the impact of our Twitter event extraction model, we have used two sources of authorised reports through collecting road traffic disruptions data from Transport for London API, and parsing the Time Out London website for sociocultural events. The analysis showed that 49.5% of the Twitter traffic comments are reported approximately five hours prior to the authorities official records. Moreover, we discovered that amongst the scheduled sociocultural event topics; tweets reporting transportation, cultural and social events are 31.75% more likely to influence the distribution of the Twitter comments than sport, weather and crime topics.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 May 2017 18:22:15 GMT  (5180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09975v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL", "authors": ["nazli farajidavar", "sefki kolozali", "payam barnaghi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09975"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.09975.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Deep Multi-View Learning Framework for City Event Extraction from Twitter Data Streams", "authors": ["Nazli Farajidavara", "Sefki Kolozalib", "Payam Barnaghic"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In this sense, understanding events in cities is of great contemporary interest [23,28,33] to city authorities in order to improve their management and to optimize operations and interactions between different city departments and services.

However, unlike our previous tweets, the two basic approaches are not monitored, so we had to combine all the event classes in our system to focus on the non-event (others) and focus on reporting on events and venues. We used SanFrancisco datasets for this comparison, as the basic assumptions were evaluated using this dataset. Table 3 shows that this evaluation led to results. We found that our CRF-NER model worked just as well as the best baseline model, B2, which was trained to 95% versus 93% accuracy in localizing terms and 84% versus 86% accuracy in events."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 CNN-enhanced LOCATION Tagging Evaluations", "text": "As mentioned above, two alternative solutions can help improve tweet annotations at the word level: i) increasing the word marker by merging multiple approaches, and ii) training a model that takes into account sentence-level reasoning for tweet annotations (i.e. classification), rather than relying solely on event-tag events. To achieve the earlier improvement, we used CNN-derived tags that match the tagging accuracy of the LOCATION class of 0.96, previously reported in Table 4 to 0.99. This localization improvement is important within our framework, as it allows us to assign more accurate locations to each extracted event, rather than assigning the events to their tweeted locations reported in previous studies [3]. To better evaluate our claims, we also tested our proposed word-tagging approaches using a more realistic dataset called London1 in London. Unlike San Francisco test data, [3] the applicant data was not acidified before the 3."}, {"heading": "4.3 Performance Evaluation II: Multi-View Learning", "text": "In this section, we will examine how the two views can be trained simultaneously to realize an extended Tweet class. As you might have noticed in Table 3, the cardinality of tweets belonging to \"Other\" is quite unbalanced for a supervised learning task. To address this problem, we have scanned the subset of data from the \"Other\" class before our multi-level training step. These data sound plausible, as if the absence of name entity tags from all other classes in a tweet can be assumed, as if a course classification of this tweet is assumed as a class.

To calculate the similarities from the average distance values, we first recalculated the average distances within the maximum distance within the class (sports class distance) and then subtracted the result from one. Thus, the similarity values are limited to a value closer to a value that guarantees a higher similarity and values close to zero show a higher degree of dissimilarity. The results of the first row in Table 7 show different Twitter event distributions compared to the low traffic numbers, where (longevity, length) are polarized."}, {"heading": "4.5 Case Studies and Web Interface", "text": "Table 8 presents case studies for classified events in London2. Looking at the content of the misclassified tweets (shown in the last three lines of the table), one can see the counter-effect of the complexity of the conversational language in classification tasks, where people occasionally use metaphors to emphasize their concepts, i.e. shooting themselves in the foot to describe the extent of a spoiled situation and the desert that misses the rain to describe a persistent lack of sensation.While in a recent study we focused on visualization in real space, in this study we have developed a web interface that depicts the intrinsic geometry of tweets through a low-level, non-linear manifold to visualize the tweets distribution in a two-dimensional euclidean space, in this study we focus on visualization in real space.

The emergence of the Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) and context-aware technologies boost a growing interest in analysing, extracting and eventually understanding city events which subsequently can be utilised to leverage the citizen observations of their cities. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using Twitter textual streams for extracting city events. We propose a hierarchical multi-view deep learning approach to contextualise citizen observations of various city systems and services such as traffic, public transport, weather, sociocultural activities and public safety as a source of city events. Our goal has been to build a flexible architecture that can learn representations useful for tasks, thus avoiding excessive task-specific feature engineering. We apply our approach on a real-world dataset consisting of event reports and tweets collected by [3] over four months from San Francisco Bay Area dataset and additional datasets collected from Greater London. The results of our evaluations show that our proposed solution outperforms the existing models and can be used for extracting city related events with an averaged accuracy of 81% over all classes. To further evaluate the impact of our Twitter event extraction model, we have used two sources of authorised reports through collecting road traffic disruptions data from Transport for London API, and parsing the Time Out London website for sociocultural events. The analysis showed that 49.5% of the Twitter traffic comments are reported approximately five hours prior to the authorities official records. Moreover, we discovered that amongst the scheduled sociocultural event topics; tweets reporting transportation, cultural and social events are 31.75% more likely to influence the distribution of the Twitter comments than sport, weather and crime topics.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
