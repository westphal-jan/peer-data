Index terms - Data Mining, Twitter, WordNet.I. INTRODUCTIONWITTER is a social networking and micro-blogging site where registered users can send messages called Tweets. A user can follow other users to receive their tweets. If the user account is not set to the Private option, tweets from that account are also accessible from the public timeline. The public timeline and tweets of users that a particular user follows are algorithms that follow the tweets to receive their tweets."}, {"heading": "II. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "Although the data is a continuous data stream and the data mining tool Weka, which was built for static data mining purposes, the overall design assumes that tweets will be available in blocks of tweets. Thus, data pre-processing was carried out separately from the Twitter stream. As the aim of the research was to develop an appropriate data pre-processing method that can be used in data mining tools such as Weka, this approach was deemed acceptable. The overall design and functioning of the data pre-processing methodology consists of 5 different phases, according to which a data model is required by Weka Data Collecting MethodologyData to train the data model, was collected through the tweet collection of desktop and online applications \"tHE ARCHIVISt.\" The public tweets, which were available in the five categories Art, Lifestyle, Politics and Business, were collected during the periods from November 24 to December 11, 2010 and February 17, 2011 to February 25, 2011."}, {"heading": "III. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS", "text": "The results of the three classifiers, Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Tree and Random Forest, with 17, 861 train data and 100 test data, were discarded as an appropriate model. Although the Random Forest model had the highest accuracy compared to the trained model because it had lower accuracy in terms of test data, it was discarded as an appropriate model. Na\u00efve Bayes performed poorly compared to train and test data, where the Random Forest model had a significantly high accuracy in terms of train data. Below, the results of the experiment are shown on three samples of test data with 100 data points each on a Random Forest basis. The average accuracy of the test data sets shows 56% in terms of the correct classification of tweets. Considering that the probability of the correct classification of a tweet manually is 20%, the model shows a 36% increase in accuracy."}, {"heading": "IV. FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS", "text": "Data processing could be further improved by replacing a URL with the actual content of the web page, as in the heading of the web page. This would greatly improve the classification and identification of words in attributes identified by an indexing algorithm. Furthermore, the use of tweets with a significantly higher number (more than 2 million) would improve the accuracy of the data model, resulting in a higher accuracy of the test data. Proposed data processing is limited to the number of words in the WordNet library. Therefore, any improvement in the WordNet library or the use of another superior word library would extract more information from the tweets into attributes, thus better representing the processed tweet in the attribute values."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Due to the ubiquity of the subjects in the stream, it is highly inefficient to operate a data mining algorithm on the raw data. This paper discusses an algorithm to classify the stream in a certain number of mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive streams; one can conclude that the proposed algorithm is in fact suitable for selecting the most relevant attributes and building the traction data necessary for the stream of classification of the operation.APPENDIXA.
