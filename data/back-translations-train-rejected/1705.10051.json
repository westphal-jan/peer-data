The key idea is that if the maximum degree of the network is limited, we could observe a single edge from the results of the queries. The algorithm is relatively simple. For each vertex u \u00b2 V, the algorithm includes the probability (u, v) to the set E \u00b2 (u) if there is a round i set so that Si = {u} and Ai = {u, v}.
