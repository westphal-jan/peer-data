Our methodology allows identifying anomalies based on a single stationary model, instead of requiring a full temporal one, which would be prohibitive in our setting. We learn our low-rank stationary model from the high-dimensional training data, and then fit a regression model for predicting the expected likelihood score of normal access patterns in the future. The disparity between the predicted and the observed likelihood scores is used to assess the \"surprise\". This approach enables calibration of the anomaly score so that time-varying normal behavior patterns are not considered anomalous. We provide a detailed description of the algorithm, including a convergence analysis, and report encouraging empirical results. One of the datasets we tested is new for the public domain. It consists of two months' worth of database access records from a live system.

This paper deals with the latter, within a timeframe. Temporal analysis [Lee et al., 2000] models the timing and frequency of user access to the database. Approaches based on dependencies and relationship analysis look for systematic redundancy in the event column protocol [Chung et al., 1999, Kamra et al., 2008]. Sequence alignment methods methods [Srivastava et al., 2006] look for frequent sequences of events, then monitor system behavior by checking for repetition of these sequences. Some methods collect different statistical information about user access to the database and use it to model normal behavior [Spalka and Lehnhardt, 2005, Mathew et al., 2010, Lee et al.] rely solely on data that is detectable during a 2002-Sali application."}, {"heading": "3 Our approach", "text": "To detect anomalous access patterns, we start by defining a probable model for normal access patterns. Our approach is based on learning a basic set of parameters based on different user intervals, and modelling the deviation of the temporal model from the stationary level. We assume that the data is provided as a sequence of consecutive time intervals in which for each time interval a different number of objects is available in which the number of access intervals is different. The aim of the algorithms is to provide an application-specific parameter.The aim of the algorithms is an anomalous score for each new access to Bt (i, j) = I [User i).The object j] is an application-specific parameter.The aim of the algorithms is an anomalous score for each new access model observed after the general distribution phase."}, {"heading": "4 The Algorithm", "text": "We describe the two phases of the algorithm: the training phase and the anomaly detection phase. In the training phase, the algorithm has access to a training set S = (B1,.., BT), where Bt is exclusively binary access matrices of consecutive time intervals. However, the algorithm splits the training set into two parts, S1 = (B1,.., BT1), S2 = (BT1 + 1,., BT). S1 is used to find an estimate for the probable stationary model \u03c0, as described in Section 4.1. S2 is used to adjust the log probability regressor w. The full training phase is provided in Section 4.2.In the anomaly detection phase, an access matrix is provided as input for each time interval, and the algorithm gives an anomaly."}, {"heading": "4.1 Estimating the matrix model", "text": "In our simplified probability model, however, it is assumed that the Bt models are drawn in the calculation of probabilities. However, our probability model, and our low assumptions in practice, are similar to those in Section 3, which are examined. [2014], Hsieh et al. [2015], in this work, however, it is assumed that only one access matrix from the number matrix is available, while we have several matrices available.

Subsequently, the selected \u03bb is used to find the estimate \u03c0. Remember that for this step, the first part of the training group, S1, is used. 1. A series of values is initialized for cross-validation (e.g. k = 10). We used the set {B-sp / 2i} Ki = 0, where K was selected adaptively by determining when a further reduction in the log probability on the validation group was not improved. 2. k-fold cross-validation (e.g. k = 10) is performed to make a selection. In the fold i, S1 is divided into a training part S1 (i) and a validation part (S1) (Si)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Unseen objects: cold start", "text": "In the above algorithm description, we avoid the problem of users or objects that are observed for the first time only after the first phase of training, i.e. after the first phase of training. Such new elements could be observed for the first time during the regression phase or later during the deployment phase, since anomalous results are calculated. In the context of collaborative filtering, this problem is commonly known as the cold start problem. [Su and Khoshgoftaar, 2009] In our setting, the challenge is to assign the probability values to the matrices Bt, which include new rows or columns that do not appear in the systems. [Previous solutions to the cold start problem in the context of collaborative filtering have suggested finding an existing user whose access pattern is most similar to that of the new user, and assigning the new user the same prediction as the existing user or a weighted score of the most similar users.

We learn our low-rank stationary model from the high-dimensional training data, and then fit a regression model for predicting the expected likelihood score of normal access patterns in the future. The disparity between the predicted and the observed likelihood scores is used to assess the \u201csurprise\u201d. This approach enables calibration of the anomaly score so that time-varying normal behavior patterns are not considered anomalous. We provide a detailed description of the algorithm, including a convergence analysis, and report encouraging empirical results. One of the datasets we tested is new for the public domain.
