Traditionally, two components of the language vocabulary are distinguished: the center and the periphery. The former contains highly stable words of maximum frequency (go, read, etc.) and provides stability in the language; the periphery contains the words that are obsolete or, on the contrary, they have just appeared in the language, guaranteeing greater flexibility. We will present some quantitative characteristics of the dynamics of the center. To do this, we should answer the following questions: How to determine the core?"}, {"heading": "2 Rate of change of the core", "text": "Of course, taking into account the rate of change of the core, this does not mean that these words occur only in a certain period of time."}, {"heading": "3 Degree of covering of texts by the core", "text": "The most important characteristics of the core words are the extent to which they are effective for communication. Formally, this can be represented by the percentage of the core words in the texts, i.e. by the degree to which the core words comprise these texts. Let us now analyze the change in the total frequency of words in these words. If we look at the core for the language state in 1800 (for greater stability in the calculations), we take the interval 1795-1805 and define the core window. For a 1000-word core, the total frequency falls in about 0.7 to 0.6 years."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In the article, the structure of the lexicon is considered from a cognitive point of view and distinguishes between the center (core - the most commonly used lexicon axis) and the periphery; the core size is evaluated differently in different essays - from 1 to 8,000 words; in our work, the calculations for all core sizes in this area are performed; the core change data is presented for the first time; it turns out that the core has changed steadily over the last 300 years - about 15% of the words are replaced every 50 years; the result is obtained for different languages (presented in Google Books Ngram) and is to some extent analogous to the results that Swodesh has obtained in terms of the stability of the words from its list; the size of the texts covered by the core words is counted (or the total frequency of the core words); it has been found that the core effect cannot only be explained by core words obsolescence (removal from the core), i.e. by updating, but also by extending the lexicon's expressive possibilities."}, {"heading": "5 References", "text": "1.
