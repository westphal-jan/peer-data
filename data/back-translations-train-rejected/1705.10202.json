Process mining has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions when applied on data from smart home environments. However, events recorded in smart home environments are on the level of sensor triggers, at which process discovery algorithms produce overgeneralizing process models that allow for too much behavior and that are difficult to interpret for human experts. We show that abstracting the events to a higher-level interpretation can enable discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework for the extraction of features that can be used for abstraction with supervised learning methods that is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. This framework can automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level, after training it on training data for which both the sensor and human activity events are known. We demonstrate our abstraction framework on three real-life smart home event logs and show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction are more precise indeed.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 May 2017 20:32:56 GMT  (890kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10202v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1606.07283"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1606.07283", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["niek tax", "natalia sidorova", "reinder haakma", "wil m p van der aalst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10202"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.10202.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["n.tax@tue.nl", "n.sidorova@tue.nl", "reinder.haakma@philips.com", "w.m.p.v.d.aalst@tue.nl"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 5.10 202v 1 [cs.L G] 25 Mevent logs P.

Conceptually, CRFs can be considered a sequential version of the logistic regression of several classes, i.e., the predictions in the prediction sequence are interdependent. A CRF models the conditional probability distribution of the sequence using a loglinear model.

So there are two reasons to deviate from this evaluation method in a process mining setting: First, our method works on events rather than on time frames. Second, the accuracy of the resulting high-level sequences is much more important for many process techniques (e.g. process finding, conformity verification) than the accuracy of predicting each minute of the day. A known metric for the distance of two sequences is the Levenshtein distance [19]. However, Levenshtein distance is not suitable for comparing sequences of human actions, as human behavior sometimes includes branches in which it does not matter in which order two activities are performed."}, {"heading": "6 Case Studies", "text": "In this section, we evaluate the supervised event abstraction framework based on three case studies of real smart home datasets."}, {"heading": "6.1 Experimental setup", "text": "We include three smart home event logs in the evaluation: the Van Kasteren Event Log [14], and two event logs from a smart home experiment by MIT [30]. All three event logs used for the evaluation consist of multi-dimensional time series data with all dimensions binary, each binary dimension representing the state of an in-home sensor. These sensors include motion sensors, open / close sensors, and power sensors (discredited to 0 / 1 states). We transform the multi-dimensional time series data relating to each sensor change point as an event. Cases are generated by grouping events that occurred on the same day, with a cut-off point provided for event recording. The following XES extensions can be used for these events."}, {"heading": "6.2 Case Study 1: Van Kasteren Event Log", "text": "For the first case study, we use the Smart Home Environment Log described in Van Kasteren et al. [14] The Van Kasteren Log contains 1285 events, divided into fourteen different sensors, and the log contains 23 days of data.The average Damerau-Levenshtein similarity between the predicted traces of human activity in the Leave-One-Trace-Out-Cross-Validation experiment and the traces of human activity on the ground is 0.7516, showing that the monitored event method produces traces that match the ground probability.Figure 5 shows the result of the inductive miner [18] for the sensory events in the Van Kasteren dataset. The resulting process model starts with a choice of four activities: hall door, hallway-bedroom door, hallway-bathroom door and front door. After this choice, the model branches out into three parallel blocks, in which the upper block of a selection of eight different types of each of activities is very similar to the other paralleled one."}, {"heading": "6.3 Case Study 2: MIT Household A Event Log", "text": "For the second case study, we use household A data from a smart home experiment conducted by MIT [30]. However, household A contains data on 16 days of life, 2701 sensor-level events recorded by 26 different sensors. Human-level activities are provided in the form of a taxonomy of activities at three levels, which are called heading, category and sub-category. At the transmission level, human activities are very general, such as personal needs. At the sub-category level, the eight different activities at the transmission level are divided into 19 different category-level activities, where personal needs branch out, for example, into eating, sleeping and personal hygiene. At the sub-category level, there are more types of human activities than sensor activities, which include very specific human activities. At the sub-category level, cleaning meals, for example, is divided into dishes and discarding dishes."}, {"heading": "6.4 Case Study 3: MIT Household B Event Log", "text": "For the third case study, we use data from household B of the MIT Smart Home experiment [30]. Household B contains data on 17 days of life, 1962 sensor-based events recorded by 20 different sensors. Identical to MIT Household A, human-level activities are provided as a three-step taxonomy. Here, too, we use the subcategory level of this taxonomy as a target activity label. The model discovered with the Inductive Miner [18] from sensor-level events is Figure 9. The model obtained allows too much behavior as it contains two large selection blocks. We found a Damerau-Levenshtein similarity of 0.5865 in the Leave-One-Trace-Out-Cross Validation experiment, which is lower than the similarity found on the MIT A dataset, while the abstraction target classes for the two datasets are the same. This can be explained by the fact that there is less behavioral data for this part of the 1932-year budget, which contains only non-specific training events B."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we presented a framework for abstract events implemented within the framework of the ProM Process Mining Toolkit. An important part of the framework is a generic method to extract useful abstraction features from the extensions to event logs defined in the XES IEEE standard. We propose the Damerau-Levenshtein Similarity to evaluate abstraction results and explain why it fits the application of Process Mining. Finally, using three real smart home datasets, we demonstrated that the application of the supervised event abstraction framework allows us to create more precise process model descriptions of human life compared to those that could be derived from the original data at the sensor level. Furthermore, these process models contain interpretable event labels at the level of human behavioral activity."}], "references": [{"title": "WMP (2016) Process Mining: Data Science in Action", "author": ["van der Aalst"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Workflow mining: Discovering process models from event logs", "author": ["WMP van der Aalst", "T Weijters", "L Maruster"], "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Activity recognition from user-annotated acceleration data", "author": ["L Bao", "SS Intille"], "venue": "Pervasive Computing,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Ontology-based activity recognition in intelligent pervasive environments", "author": ["L Chen", "C Nugent"], "venue": "International Journal of Web Information Systems", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Harmonic exponential families on manifolds", "author": ["T Cohen", "M Welling"], "venue": "Proceedings of The 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, JMLR Workshop & Conference Proceedings,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2015}, {"title": "2016) BPMN miner: Automated discovery of bpmn process models with hierarchical structure", "author": ["R Conforti", "M Dumas", "L Garc\u0131\u0301a-Ba\u00f1uelos", "M La Rosa"], "venue": "Information Systems", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2016}, {"title": "A technique for computer detection and correction of spelling errors.

Process mining has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions when applied on data from smart home environments. However, events recorded in smart home environments are on the level of sensor triggers, at which process discovery algorithms produce overgeneralizing process models that allow for too much behavior and that are difficult to interpret for human experts. We show that abstracting the events to a higher-level interpretation can enable discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework for the extraction of features that can be used for abstraction with supervised learning methods that is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. This framework can automatically abstract sensorlevel events to their interpretation at the human activity level, after training it on training data for which both the sensor and human activity events are known. We demonstrate our abstraction framework on three real-life smart home event logs and show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction are more precise indeed.
