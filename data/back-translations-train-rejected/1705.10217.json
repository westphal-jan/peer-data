Available Competency Questions for SUMO", "text": "In this section, we review the CQs suggested in the literature for the evaluation of SUMO-based ontologies. We classify these CQs into 2 sets, depending on the way they are created method.On the one hand, the first set consists of only 64 CQs that were created manually (creative CQs).This set includes the 33 CQs belonging to the Common Sense Reasoning (CSR) domain of the TPTP problem library that are based on SUMO. For example, the next conjecture of the CSR domain belongs to the TPTP problem library (forall) ORG2? ORG2) Domain of the TPTPTP problem library (and (mother? ORG2)."}, {"heading": "3. Automatic Evaluation of FOL Ontologies using CQs", "text": "In this section, we summarize our adaptation of the methodology for designing and evaluating ontologies introduced in [17] to apply them automatically using modern ATPs, as originally proposed in [3].In [17], the authors propose to evaluate the expressivity of an ontology by proving completeness theories whether we find a set of CQs. Proving the completeness of theorems requires verifying whether or not a particular CQ is associated with ontology: that is, in the face of an ontology and a projection that we must decide whether we want to or not. To this end, we propose to use ATPs such as Vampires [35] or VanHelsing [20] that the work by Refutation12 works within certain execution times and memory limits. Theoretically, if the presumption by ontology, then ATPs ultimately finds a refutation."}, {"heading": "4. Automatic Creation of CQs Using WordNet", "text": "In this section, we present our proposal for creating problems through the use of WordNet and its representation in SUMO, as illustrated in Figure 1. Our proposal is a much more advanced version of the method presented in [3]. Among other improvements, we are now using the different representation relationship between WordNet and SUMO, which was treated equally in [3], and we are now able to utilize additional WordNet information. In addition, we have also improved the process of representation between WordNet and the core of SUMO. Consequently, our proposals are the first attempts to use WordNet for the evaluation of SUMO and, in general, for the evaluation of knowledge-based resources of this kind. As far as we know, our proposals are the first attempts to use WordNet for the evaluation of SUMO."}, {"heading": "4.1.

Event Patterns", "text": "In this section, we describe the problems arising from the question patterns based on the semantic relation event defined in WordNet's Morphosemantic Links database [10] for validating synset mapping information. To this end, we not only assume that WordNet statements and synset mapping information are correct, but also assume that WordNet synsets related by event should be associated with the same SUMO concept, since event refers to verb and noun synsets related to the same process. Under these assumptions, we propose a new problem for each verb and noun synset related by event, so that its truth test indicates that the concepts associated with these synsets are compatible."}, {"heading": "6.1. Event Pattern #1", "text": "The first pattern of questions focuses on the 26 pairs of events in which both synsets are associated with two different SUMO classes, using equivalence. Since the mapping of these synsets denotes exactly the SUMO class to which the synset is related, our pattern of questions states that these SUMO classes are completely equivalent by using equivalence. For example, the kill10v and killing 2n synsets are event-related and each associated with the SUMO classes Deathc = and Killingc =, as described in Figure 6, from which we obtain the next truth test: (equal to Death Killing) (14) The corresponding falsehood test, which is obtained by negation (14), states that Deathc and Killingc are different. This falsehood test is classified as not passed only in Adimen-SUMO v2.6: The patient of Killingc is limited to being an instance of Humanc, while each instance of Organismc can be the patient of Dec."}, {"heading": "6.2. Event Pattern #2", "text": "In this subsection, we describe the question pattern that focuses on the 509 pairs of events to which one synset is connected by equivalence, while the other synset is connected by instance or subsumption. In this case, we know the exact SUMO class to which the synset is connected by equivalence, as in the previous subsection. However, for the synset connected by subsumption or instance, we only know the superclass of the SUMO class to which this synset is related; that is, we know that the synset is associated with any subclass of the class provided in the mapping information. So, to prove that these SUMO classes are compatible, we need to prove that the class associated with the synset connected by equivalence is a subclass of the class associated with the class provided by subsumption or instance.For example, Fix1 v and Fixing1 are related by event and associated with Predingc + Reteningpac and Replacement = as described in Figure 7."}, {"heading": "6.3. Event Pattern #3", "text": "Finally, we focus on the 5,130 event pairs, where both synsets are linked by instance or subsumption. In this case, we only know the superclass of the SUMO class to which each synset is related. So to prove that these SUMO classes are compatible, we need to show that these SUMO classes have some subclass in common. For example, evaluation 1v and evaluation 1n are event-related and each associated with Judgingc + and Comparingc +, as shown in Figure 8. From this event pair, we create a new problem, so that its truth test states that Judgingc and Comparingc have some common subclasses: (exists (? X) (16) (and ($subclass? X evaluation) ($subclass? X evaluation))). Thus, the corresponding falsehood test states that Judgingc and Comparingc do not have a common subclass. Guess (16) and their negation are not provoked by this supratation - or suprat- in our supratation 11."}, {"heading": "7. Antonym Patterns", "text": "In this section, we describe the problems arising from the question patterns based on antonyms for validating knowledge in ontology according to WordNet \u2022 therefore, question patterns focus on antonymy - which relates words with opposing semantics - and similarity - which links semantically comparable words - relationships of WordNet (see Figure 2) and seeks to create new problems so that their truth tests state that the SUMO objects referring to antonymous words are not compatible. Thus, the corresponding falsehood tests state that the SUMO objects referring to antonymous words are compatible. WordNet provides 7,604 antonym pairs, of which 1,950 are noun pairs, 1,016 are verb pairs, 3,998 are adjective pairs and 640 are adjective pairs."}, {"heading": "7.1. Antonym Pattern #1", "text": "In this case, we assume that all SUMO objects represented by the statement from the first synset are incompatible with all SUMO objects represented by the statement from the second synset. Formally, this implies that the variables used in the SUMO statements proposed for the translation of mapping information are considered universally quantified. For example, by considering? X? Y death) and? Y as instance birth 2 n and death 1 n as universally quantified, the following truth test results from the combination of statements (17) and (18): (forall? X? Y) (18) ($example? Y death) (18)."}, {"heading": "7.2. Antonym Pattern #2", "text": "The second question pattern focuses on the 2,542 antonym pairs in which equivalence (or its complementarity) is mixed with subsumption (or its complementarity) or instance. As in the previous case, we consider the variable in the SUMO statement proposed for the translation of equivalence-mapping information to be universally quantified. On the contrary, the variable in the SUMO statement translates substance or instance-mapping information as existentially quantified because the information provided by these mapping relationships is weaker than the information provided by equivalence. Since we use both universally and existentially quantified variables, there are two additional options: we can negate the universally quantified statement within the formula derived from the existentially quantified statement, or the existentially quantified statement within the formula."}, {"heading": "7.3. Antonym Pattern #3", "text": "In the third question pattern, based on the antonym, we focus on the 81,834 antonym pairs, where both synsets are connected by subsumption (or complementarity) and instance. As before, we consider the variables used in SUMO statements to be existentially quantified, implying that some of the SUMO objects represented by the instructions obtained from the mapping information of the antonym synsets are incompatible. For example, the antonym synsets 1a and unstained1 a are associated with Coloringc + and SurfaceChangec + (see Figure 11), from which we receive the following instructions: ($instance? X Coloring) (23) (not ($instance? Y SurfaceChanging). Therefore, we suggest the following truth test (? X? Y) ($instance? Y Cheanging) ($?)"}, {"heading": "8.
