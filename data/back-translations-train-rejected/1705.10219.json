A White-Box Testing Strategy", "text": "In this section, we propose a white-box testing strategy for FOL ontologies, defined on the basis of the syntactical form of the formulas derived from their axioms; the logic behind our proposal is to ensure that the formula obtained from each axiom can be implicitly chosen by ATPs if they function through their refutation; our purpose is twofold: firstly, to detect defects; secondly, to classify axioms as suitable for argumentation; and, we assume that the reader has a certain degree of familiarity with the syntax and basic terms of FOL. We call sentences to each FOL formula that all their variable operations are within the framework (or bound by) of a quantification formula; and, we use capitalist Greek letters for (finite) sentences that can be regarded as equivalent conjunctions of all their members; and, we use Greek letters for arbitrary formulae."}, {"heading": "5. Calculating White-Box Tests", "text": "In this section we will introduce the definition of two functions, each of which yields the sets of falsity and truth tests for a proposition. The first function is defined by induction in the proposition assumed to belong to Formula 1. Our assumption is not a limitation, since it is known that any FOL formula can be transformed into a logically equivalent formula in the above language. Transformation follows the three initial steps of the standard algorithm, which transforms each FOL formula into its conjunctive normal form: 1. Elimination of variable collisions is accomplished by renaming variables."}, {"heading": "6. A Detailed Example", "text": "In this section we provide a complete example of a series of tests performed by using the axioms in Section 5.For the example we consider the following axioms: ($Domain Component 1 CorpuscularObject) (22) ($Domain Component 2 CorpuscularObject) (23) (= > ($Instance? ATOM Atom) (? PROTON? ELECTRON? ELECTRON) (and (Component? PROTON? ATOM) (Component? ELECTRON? ATOM) ($Instance? PROTON Proton) ($Instance? ELECTRON electron))))) Using the type information in Axioms (22-23) (see [1]) we can assume that the FOL formula we have obtained from axiom (24) is an af-nnf formula of formal formula = one (\u20ac1)."}, {"heading": "7. Correctness", "text": "In this section, we will discuss the veracity of the proposed tests. As explained in sections 4 and 5, our white box testing strategy is related to the existence of redundant subformulas in disjunctive subformulas. That is, the detection of defects consists in searching for redundant subformulas, while formulas are classified as suitable when no defect can be detected. Next, we will introduce our concept of redundancy. Definition 3. Let us formulate a series of sentences and sentences so that these two sentences are the same. We say that these formulas contain a redundancy (according to the FT) if there is a sentence that logically means that this definition is so."}, {"heading": "8. Experimentation", "text": "In this section, we report on the results obtained by applying our white box testing method using ATPs. First, we describe in detail and with examples the type of defects that can be detected automatically by following our proposal, and also the different levels of suitability in which clauses can be classified. Then, we describe the process of testing KIFDOLCE, CASL-DOLCE, FPK and Adimen-SUMO in sections 8.2-8.4. Some figures on the process of testing these ontologies are summarized in Table 2. In particular: \u2022 The total number of general clauses (non-atomic axioms) in each ontology (including Table 1 and the amount of tested clauses (general clauses columns). \u2022 The total number of falsity tests proposed for each ontology and the number of different falsity tests (non-atomic axioms) in each ontology (including Table 1 and the set of tested clauses)."}, {"heading": "8.1.

Testing DOLCE", "text": "In this area, we rely on the results of the DOLCE tests with the proposed white box testing methodology (Section 2). We are considering two different versions of DOLCE: KIF-DOLCE, which is based on the translation in [1], and CASL-DOLCE, which is based on the simplified translation of DOLCE into CASL [4], which is available in Hets [5]. Regarding KIF-DOLCE, we have obtained 10,151 falsity tests for tests as described in Table 2. Among the proposed falsity tests, 2,138 are unique. Thus, we have also obtained 10,151 truth tests, which are described in Section 3, the falsity tests (forall)."}, {"heading": "8.3. Testing FPK", "text": "Next, we review the results of the FPK tests. As described in Table 2, we have received 144,902 falsehood tests for testing 5,753 axioms, of which 37,698 are unique, and also the same amount of (unique) truth tests. In Table 5 - which follows the same structure as Table 3 - we summarize the results of the FPK tests according to the methodology for classifying the tests described in Section 3. 581 falsehood tests (NP column, 1.54% of the total) are classified as non-transferable. Analysis of the evidence shows that most of the defects detected are trivial redundancies. This is not surprising since the goal of the Flyspeck project checks every logical inference, including trivial ones. For example, that the truth value is encrypted in ontology using the following axioms (called aTRUTRUTH): 11p"}, {"heading": "8.4. Testing and Improving Adimen-SUMO", "text": "In this section we describe the process of testing and improving Adimen-SUMO v2.4 by correcting all of the defects mentioned above. As a result, we obtained the testing of 1,622 axioms (58.24% of the 2,785 clauses). Among the proposed tests are unique (see Table 2).The results of testing Adimen-SUMO v2.4 by following the methodology in Section 3 are summarized."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "A long-standing dream of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been pursued to enrich computer programs with the common sense that allows machines to think about our world [22]. This work provides a new practical insight into the automatic testing of first-order logic (FOL) ontologies. Next, we review the main contributions and results contained in this paper and discuss future work. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first attempt to fully test the ontologies of FOL using ATPs. In addition, we provide formal evidence of the correctness of the proposed tests and report on the practical application of our methodology to four different FOL ontologies: Adimen-SUMO, KIF-DOLCE strategies, CASL-DOLCE and FPK. Through our methodology, we have been able to identify some shortcomings that have arisen in the last two years."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partly funded by the Spanish projects TUNER (TIN2015-65308-C5-1-R) and COMMAS (TIN2013-46181-C2-2-R), the Basque project LoRea (GIU15 / 30) and BAILab (UFI11 / 45)."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.
