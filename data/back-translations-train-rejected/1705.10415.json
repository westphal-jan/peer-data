In this paper, we explore a complex network approach to assign the authorship of texts based on their mesoscopic representation, in an attempt to capture the flow of the narrative. Indeed, as reported in this work, such an approach allowed the identification of the dominant narrative structure of the studied authors. This has been achieved due to the ability of the mesoscopic approach to take into account relationships between different, not necessarily adjacent, parts of the text, which is able to capture the story flow. The potential of the proposed approach has been illustrated through principal component analysis, a comparison with the chance baseline method, and network visualization. Such visualizations reveal individual characteristics of the authors, which can be understood as a kind of calligraphy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 May 2017 23:34:03 GMT  (5664kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10415v1", "TextGraphs ACL 2017 (to appear)"]], "COMMENTS": "TextGraphs ACL 2017 (to appear)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vanessa q marinho", "henrique f de arruda", "thales s lima", "luciano f costa", "diego r amancio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10415"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.10415.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the \u201cCalligraphy\u201d of Books", "authors": ["Vanessa Queiroz Marinho", "Henrique Ferraz de Arruda", "Thales Sinelli Lima", "Luciano da Fontoura Costa", "Diego Raphael Amancio"], "emails": ["ldfcosta}@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The ever-increasing availability of public content on the Internet - including books, tweets and blog posts - implies in many new developments in multiple natural language processing (NLP) areas such as machine translation, sentiment analysis and authorship attribution. Recently, progress in the latter task has been made through the use of complex networks (Antiqueira et al., 2006; Lahiri and Mihalcea, 2013; Marinho et al., 2016; Akimushkin et al., 2017).The network models used in many of these works are based on word contexts. In this approach, every single word is represented by a node, and edges connect adjacent words. Although this networked representation is successful in many tasks, it is not without its share of problems. Co-occurrences networks do not represent the topical structure in many texts and are generally free of community structures."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Since the groundbreaking work of Mosteller and Wallace (1964), attribution of authorship has been a widely studied problem, and several different approaches have been proposed. One of the first approaches was to analyze the frequency of common words, such as to or the, to classify political essays by authorship (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964).Since then, the method of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) has been expanded to include various attributes that are capable of qualifying spellings, including lexical, characteristic, syntactic and semantic characteristics of authorship (Stamatos, 2009).Simple lexical and characteristic characteristics (e.g. frequency and fragility of words and characters, average text lengths and others) that are used in several works, such as Grieve (2007), Koppel et al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al."}, {"heading": "3 Methods", "text": "In this section we describe the process of generating mesoscopic networks from raw text.

(2017).Such networks are able to represent the text unfolding over time that is normally overlooked by traditional approaches. Furthermore, these networks have been used to classify documents between real and mixed texts, using only simple statistics.The high accuracy of the words obtained in this classification task led us to conclude that mesoscopic networks are capable of representing structural aspects of real texts, such as the organization and development of the author's idea. To create the network from a given text (T), some pre-processing steps can be applied. In our study, we removed the stopwords, and the rest of the words have been lemmatized."}, {"heading": "3.2 Network Pruning", "text": "Mesoscopic networks are complete weighted graphs, i.e. each node is connected to each other node (Newman, 2010).In this paper, we repeatedly removed the lowest weighted edges until each network reached a fixed network average < k >.The average degree of a network g with E edges and N nodes is defined as < k > = 2 \u043c E N. (2) We used multiple values of < k >, ranging from 5 to 50, in steps of 5."}, {"heading": "3.3 Network Measurements", "text": "Most of these measurements (apart from variety diversity) relate to a single node, so to get a more comprehensive characterization, we calculated the average standard deviation and skew (third moment) of each distribution, and the statistics obtained from these distributions were then used as characteristics in machine learning methods.1 For most of these measurements, we used the Igraph software package (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) Degree: The degree quantifies the number of connections of a node (Costa et al., 2007). Although the average degree of all networks is the same as a consequence of network bouncing, the degree of each node within the network can still vary. Therefore, we used the standard deviation and skew of that measurement, without taking into account the average. Average degree of neighbors: The average degree of neighbors (Pastor-Satorras al, 2001) describes the neighbors are well connected."}, {"heading": "3.4 Machine Learning Methods", "text": "Several classifiers - Decision Trees, Random Forest, kNN, Logistic Regressors, SVM, Naive Bayes (Duda et al., 2000) - were tested to select the most suitable ones. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest were selected. We used the linear SVM implementation (with standard parameters) and Random Forest with 50 trees, both available from Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). We used the leave-oneout cross-validation technique, in which only one instance of data is used as a test, while all others are used for training the classifier. An attempt was made to select the features, but no specific subset of features stood out, so all measurements were taken into account."}, {"heading": "4 Results and Discussion", "text": "In this section we describe the selected data set and present the obtained results in two parts: (i) the complete set of authors and (ii) four authors representing important types of work."}, {"heading": "4.1 Dataset", "text": "To investigate whether authors can be distinguished by the narrative flow in their works, we created mesoscopic networks of multiple texts. Our data set consists of 100 English texts by 20 different authors (five per author) extracted from Machicao et al. (2016). The 20 authors selected are: Andrew Lang, Arthur Conan Doyle, B. M. Bower, Bram Stoker, Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, H. G. Wells, Hector H. Munro (Saki), Henry James, Herman Melville, Horatio Alger, Jane Austen, Mark Twain, Nathaniel Hawthorne, P. G. Wodehouse, Richard Harding Davis, Thomas Hardy, Washington Irving and Zane Grey. The entire data set was taken from the Gutenberg repository."}, {"heading": "4.2 Complete Set of Authors", "text": "In the first experiment, we used all the books of all 20 authors and obtained the results presented in Table 1. Remarkably, our best result, although the probability of baseline2Project Gutenberg - https: / / www.gutenberg.org / for this experiment is only 5% (each author has the same chance of being randomly selected), was as high as 35%. In addition, 17 (48.5%) of the 35 books correctly classified by our method were written by only 4 authors: namely Andrew Lang, B. M. Bower, Hector H. Munro (Saki) and Henry JamesWe also performed a pair classification, and the results obtained were compared with a traditional approach normally used in literature, the analysis of the most common words. For this experiment, we used the original texts of each book, extracted the frequency of the 20 most common words, and then used an SVM classifier. Figure 2 shows the accuracy of the traditional features, and Figure 3 illustrates the paired classification of the individual networks we obtain with the average frequency of the SVM words."}, {"heading": "4.3 Small Set of Authors", "text": "From the 20 authors considered in the previous subsection, we selected four authors, namely Charles Darwin, Thomas Hardy, Edgar Allan Poe, and Mark Twain. They were selected because two of them have multiple novels (Thomas Hardy and Mark Twain), Edgar Allan Poe is best known for writing short stories, and Charles Darwin wrote about his scientific theories and observations. The accuracy now obtained in classifying these novels was increased to 65% (Random Forests) and 50% (SVM) by using mesoscopic representation, contrasting with the random baseline of 25% achieved for four authors. Remarkably, one of Thomas Hardy's book Talsable Man (Edgar Changed Other) is one of the four authors listed in Figure 4.The PCA results indicate a clear division between the groups of books associated with each author."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "Complex networking methods have been applied with increasing success to several natural language processing tasks. In some of these approaches, part of the text is presented as a co-occurence network that reflects the syntactic relationship between words (Cancho and Sole \u0301, 2001). Although this is a well-known representation, it is not without its share of problems. For example, these networks are unable to represent the current structure in many texts. To overcome such a limitation, a mesoscopic representation was recently proposed (de Arruda et al., 2017). The main objective of this approach was to take into account the semantic relationship between text snippets and texts. More specifically, the network nodes correspond with texts from successive paragraphs, while the edges are weighted by the similarity between the respective texts. Statistics of some local topological measurements were used to characterize the mesoscopic networks."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "V.Q.M. and D.R.A. are grateful for the financial support of the Sa Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) (grant no. 15 / 05676-8, 16 / 19069-9.

This has been achieved due to the ability of the mesoscopic approach to take into account relationships between different, not necessarily adjacent, parts of the text, which is able to capture the story flow. The potential of the proposed approach has been illustrated through principal component analysis, a comparison with the chance baseline method, and network visualization.
