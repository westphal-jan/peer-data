MOBA PHASES\u2019 CHALLENGES", "text": "A MOBA game can be divided into several phases, one of which is associated with specific challenges. Identifying such challenges and game features is important in order to better understand the game and to discuss the main avenues for AI research on MOBA. In the next sections, we describe the main characteristics and strategies for each phase, and then present the main challenges related to AI. The phases are described in chronological order, starting before the game actually begins, up to the point at which the game status becomes more consolidated."}, {"heading": "A. Pick and Ban Phase", "text": "Most MOBAs provide players with a large hero base that allows them to develop specific strategies and select heroes who stand out against other heroes, an action known as counter-picking. Normally, there are two main hero pick modes: blind and tournament. In blind mode, each player team freely selects from the hero pool without knowing the heroes of the opposing team. In tournament mode, on the other hand, each team takes turns selecting heroes and is allowed to execute bans against the other team, as shown in Figure 2. Moreover, in tournament mode, the hero is selected or viewed by all players in the game. A hero cannot be selected twice in tournament mode, while in blind mode, he can be selected once by each team. Most professional players and eSports staff agree that the game can sometimes be defined during the pick-and-ban phase, because there are some heroes who excel in game strategy, especially in professional gameplay, where the players have better mechanical skills."}, {"heading": "B. Opening Phase", "text": "The opening phase begins when the game begins and ends when the reptiles or minions reach the middle of each track. This phase consists of two main tasks: the purchase of the opening items and the role distribution. Optionally, there can be pickoffs, team fights of level one or jungle invasions.The act of buying the very first items depends heavily on the enemies the hero will face. However, the initial items are very hesitant, as the player can only guess which hero he will play against. For example, if the player has a deep understanding of the meta, he can predict which hero will be in each track, but this can only be a guess.The role distribution is not only to assign a hero a role, but also to make the initial positioning in the game environment. For example, the defined strategy may suggest a reversal of the tracks to get the hero to face a weaker hero and thus maximize his chances of winning the battle."}, {"heading": "C. Laning Phase", "text": "These resources come mainly from executing load hits on enemy minions coming into the alley. In addition, the player should be careful not to be damaged by the enemies. In some games, such as Dota and Dota2, the enemy heroes can also damage their allied reptiles, making it difficult for the player to execute the last reptiles. Also, the player should be careful not to be damaged by the enemies. In some games, such as Dota2, the enemy heroes can also damage their allied reptiles."}, {"heading": "D. Mid Game", "text": "The middle game is considered to be the phase in which the strategy takes shape after the Laning Phase. Often there are three main strategies found in most MOBA games: team combat, pickoff and lane push. The team combat strategy is to focus the game on strategic advantages by defeating the enemy team in a series of group battles. Teams that focus on this strategy often have carry and tank heroes. The first is a hero who is able to inflict severe damage on the enemy, while the second is able to take a lot of damage. By winning these battles, the entire team gains gold and experience, while the enemy team is punished with time penalties. Pickoff is the action of selecting a vulnerable or weak hero and trying to kill him. Normally, this strategy focuses on defeating the enemy by selecting and killing important heroes in order to gain combat advantages or weaken a main hero in the group."}, {"heading": "E. Late Game", "text": "The late game is the final phase of a MOBA match. It starts when almost all heroes are missing one or two points to complete their list. At this stage, the heroes are strong and the number of possible actions is high, making fights more complex. Caught in the late game alone usually means being defeated. Also, the time penalty for killing in the late game is higher, which affects the teams during the fights. If heroes have filled out their items, they could initiate a bullet change. It is to swap the less valuable items for better ones. This technique also helps the team counteract enemy strategies by using more appropriate items. In the late game, it is common for the heroes to reach their maximum potential. Heroes who are meant to be tanks can absorb large amounts of damage while they can do enormous damage. Duels or battles of one against one are mechanically driven, which means that the most experienced players will win the battle if their powers are almost the same."}, {"heading": "F. Side Challenges", "text": "In addition to the specific challenges found in each phase of the game, there are some challenges inherent in the game as a whole, and these challenges are related to two types of analysis found in MOBA: Prediction and Combat Analysis. These two areas agree in a sense that combat analysis depends on predictions and vice versa. Here, we list some of the prediction and combat challenges found in MOBA: \u2022 Battle results from duels (1 to 1) and team combat; \u2022 Deadly enemies from a series of actions or combinations; \u2022 Strategies that need to be executed by the enemy team; \u2022 Winners of the phase. In terms of combat analysis, battle results prediction can only be performed by analyzing the interactions between a group of heroes involved in the combat scenario. These interactions were previously investigated in Dota 2 [12]. A specific case of this scenario is the duel in which two opposing heroes fight each other, with the winner appearing to be able to predict each other's movements, although it is easy to duel."}, {"heading": "IV.

A DISCRETIZED MODEL FOR MOBA STUDY", "text": "After studying the MOBA structure, phases and elements, we see that the game is based on individual parts that can be isolated to perform a better study. Thus, we propose a model based on the individual core gameplay of each mechanical task from the MOBA game. In addition, a test bed could be generated based on this model, making it possible to perform preliminary learning processes and tests at a faster pace. Furthermore, it is known that MOBA, like its predecessor RTS, is divided into abstract decision layers. These layers mean that the agent should carry out decision-making at micro and macro levels. These abstract levels allow the AI to work in an individual skill without taking further into account. Furthermore, the model is proposed in a way that has no dependence on another part, in which the decision-making simulation takes place at micro and macro levels."}, {"heading": "B. Laning", "text": "The Laning Phase is one of the most important phases in the MOBA gameplay, and winning this phase could bring an important strategic advantage in addition to more gold and experience. Learning the Laning Phase is important for any AI agent and a difficult task, as many agents and structures are involved. Creating a Laning Model should help the agent analyze resource collection, targeting, harassment, and tower dive strategies.Therefore, it is necessary to implement a complete tracking system consisting of heroes, crawlers, and tower turners. Enemy simulation / modeling is optional, as the agent could learn how to fight in another scenario, such as the Team Fight Model.This system could simulate a wide range of micro-management skills."}, {"heading": "C. Team fights", "text": "The team combat model should allow players to interact with each other, and could be included in a single-track map, which should simulate team fights and further develop the system to properly reflect on combat outcomes and possible interactions between players. This system could be modeled both from a theoretical point of view and in a practical approach. In fact, theoretical combat simulation is possible because team combat consists of a series of interactions that are contained in a period of time, which could be modeled as a time graph showing the interactions between players. In fact, professional players and coaches are already running the simulation they call Theorycraft, which consists of a mathematical analysis of the game [13]. After carrying out this analysis, the player formulates theories which give the most advantage to his or her game strategy / his hero's interactions and objects. This field could benefit from models that are already established, such as econometrics [14].Many combinations and analyses could be made in an effective team combat model."}, {"heading": "D. A Theoretical MOBA model", "text": "In addition to discrediting the MOBA game, the game as a whole can be analyzed using a theoretical model, as is the case in most sports such as football, football and rugby. This model could also theoretically be taken into account by coaches and players when planning positioning, hero groups and strategies. An example is shown in Figure 3.It can be faster to simulate games using diagrams and theoretical models to predict or analyze strategic situations and positions. This analysis can even take into account the likelihood of success in executing the game mechanics by modelling it as a probabilistic graphical model. Such probabilities can be calculated from the performance achieved in the previous discrete parts, and should be identified in the strategy and playing style of a team and its strategies. Such a model could even be used to identify emerging strategies that are unusual for players and teams, and to exceed their common strategies."}, {"heading": "VI.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We note that research interest in MOBA games is increasing, but is still in its infancy. By presenting and discussing the key features and challenges introduced by MOBA games, we want to \"shift the course towards better understanding and greater use of MOBA games as a research platform.\" For future work, we believe that the discrete framework proposed in this paper should be developed to provide a reliable testing ground for research.
