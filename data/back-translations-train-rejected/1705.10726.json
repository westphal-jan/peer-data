Specifically, we are adding a system of uncertainty derived from Chisholm's epistemology [Chisholm, 1987].1 System S is a work in progress, and therefore the presentation here will be inherently abstract. One of our primary motivations is to design a system of uncertainty that is easy for end users to use. There are many studies showing that laymen have difficulty understanding raw probability values (see e.g. [Kaye and Koehler, 1991]); and we believe that our philosophy-based approach can pave the way to present uncertain statements in a more comprehensible format."}, {"heading": "2 Prior Work", "text": "Recently, we have presented an automation of the doctrine of double effect in [Govindarajulu and Bringsjord, 2017] Other tasks automated by cognitive calculations are the false-belief task [Arkoudas and Bringsjord, 2008] and acrasia (which exposes itself to the temptation to violate moral principles) Other tasks automated by cognitive calculations include the false-belief task [Arkoudas and Bringsjord, 2008] and acrasia (the temptation to violate moral principles)."}, {"heading": "3 The Formal System", "text": "The formal system \u00b5C is a modal extension of the event calculation. < The event calculation is a first order multisorted logic with a family of axiom sets. The exact axiom set is not important. The primary types in the system are presented below. Description types of human and non-human actors. They are set in motion at certain times by actors. (E.g.: \"food\" vs. \"jack eats.\" Action A subtype of events that occur as actions of actors. Fluent used to describe states of the world in the event calculation.Full DCEC has a set of modal operators and sequence schemes. Here we focus on just two: an operator for belief B and an operator for perception P. The system syntax and inference schemes are below the event calcu-lus.Full DCEC has a set of synchronized operators and inference schemes that refer to emata."}, {"heading": "4 The Uncertainty System S", "text": "Note: Chisholm's system is free, while our epistemology is based on a primitive, undefined binary relationship, which he considers to be a reasonable relationship with an agent at the time by which he defines a scale of strengths by which we define a new operator that one could have in a given case. Note: Chisholm's system is free, while our agent is agentative based. Let it be more reasonable at the time than to believe in an agent. For convenience, we define a new operator, the restraint operator W, defined below: W (one, one, one, two)."}, {"heading": "5 Usage", "text": "In this section, we illustrate S by applying it to solve fundamental problems such as the lottery paradox [Kyburg Jr., 1961, p. 197] and a toy version of a real example, a murder riddle example (based on the traditions of logic pedagogy). Finally, we very briefly outline abstract scenarios in which S can be used to generate uncertainty values for counterfactual statements and to generate explanations for actions."}, {"heading": "5.1 Paradoxes: Lottery Paradox", "text": "In the paradox, we have a situation in which an agent begins to believe one and a nd and a nd of a seemingly consisting series of premises (\"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"nd\" of a \"and a\" nd \"of a\" and a \"nd\" of a \"and a\" and a \"of a\" nd \"of a\" and a \"and a\" of a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" of a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" of a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" of a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"of a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a\" and a \"and a"}, {"heading": "5.2 Application: Solving a Murder", "text": "The agent knows that a gun is involved in the murder and that the owner of the gun in t3 committed the murder. s also knows that Alice is the owner of the gun, initially at the time t0.Presumption in Favor of Alice Being the MurdererFrom these very facts, the agent has a certain conjecture that Alice is the murder.Proof Sketch: All of the above statements can be taken as certain convictions.

We can then look at the narrowest consistent sentences of \"below\": \"1\" holds (f, t) and \"2\" holds (g, t) paragraph III of the definition of reasonableness gives us: B (a, t, holds (f, t)) at B (a, t, holds (g, t))."}, {"heading": "5.4 Explanations", "text": "The definitions of the above strength factors and reasonableness can be used to create high-level explanatory schemes that can be used instead of a simple representation of the raw probability values for the end user. Although we have not specified these explanatory schemes, we illustrate a possible scheme: Say an agent performs an action \u03b1 on the basis of \u03c6. In this case, the agent could generate a statement that merely states at the highest level that it is more reasonable for the agent to believe in \u03c6 than for the agent to believe in Celsius. The agent could then further explain why it was reasonable for him by using one of the three clauses in the definition of reasonableness."}, {"heading": "6 Inference Algorithm Sketch", "text": "The detailed description of the inference algorithm goes beyond the scope of this paper, but here we provide a sketch at the highest level. [6] Our calculation of evidence is merely an extension of the standard firstorder-proof calculation under various modal contexts. For example, if a believes that b believes in a number of propositions, a believes that b believes, and we believe that B. We convert B (a, ta, B (b, tb, Q) to the pure formula Q of the first order (context (a, ta, b, tb)) and use a first order prover. The conversion process is somewhat more nuanced as we have to deal with negations, deal properly with substitutions of equities, uncertainties, and transform compound formulas within repeated beliefs."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We have outlined the first steps towards building a system of uncertainty based on both probability and evidence theory that could be suitable for (1) solving fundamental problems; (2) useful for applications; (3) generating uncertainty values for counterfactors; and (4) building understandable explanations. Many challenges remain, some relatively simple and others quite difficult. Simple challenges include defining and experimenting with different candidates for PR, BRD, BRD and BRD countries. On the more difficult side, we need to find comprehensible arithmetic mechanisms for calculating the minimal < BRD, BRD > in the definition of BRD. Also, on the difficult side, there is the challenge of developing efficient argumentation programs. Although we have an exact follow-up algorithm, we believe that an approximate set of beliefs is selectively discarded in a large knowledge base during reasoning."}, {"heading": "8 Acknowledgements", "text": "We are grateful to the Office of Naval Research for funding research that has made the research presented in this paper possible."}, {"heading": "A Appendix: Slate Proofs", "text": "Figure 1: Alice is murder: B (s, t, murderer (Alice) Believe in s, 1 FOL, 1 FOL, 6, x (murderer (x, weapon), t3)) (x = 6) (x = 6) (x = 6) Assumption, 4, x, t (possession (x, weapon), t) (possession (y, weapon), t) (x = y)) (x = 4) (x = 4) Assumption, 3) Assumption, 3.

We present a sketch of a novel algorithm for reasoning that extends firstorder resolution. Finally, while there have been many systems of uncertainty for propositional logics, first-order logics and propositional modal logics, there has been very little work in building systems of uncertainty for first-order modal logics.
