In this study, we leverage textual data from the website \"Backpage\"- used for classified advertisement- to discern potential patterns of human trafficking activities which manifest online and identify advertisements of high interest to law enforcement. Due to the lack of ground truth, we rely on a human analyst from law enforcement, for hand-labeling a small portion of the crawled data. We extend the existing Laplacian SVM and present S3VM-R, by adding a regularization term to exploit exogenous information embedded in our feature space in favor of the task at hand. We train the proposed method using labeled and unlabeled data and evaluate it on a fraction of the unlabeled data, herein referred to as unseen data, with our expert's further verification. Results from comparisons between our method and other semi-supervised and supervised approaches on the labeled data demonstrate that our learner is effective in identifying advertisements of high interest to law enforcement", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 05:51:53 GMT  (2029kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10786v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["hamidreza alvari", "paulo shakarian", "j e kelly snyder"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10786"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.10786.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Semi-Supervised Learning for Detecting Human Trafficking", "authors": ["Hamidreza Alvari", "Paulo Shakarian", "J.E.

The description usually briefly lists the attributes of the person (s) and the phone numbers. In this work, we focus only on the textual component of the data. These free text data required significant cleaning due to a variety of problems common in text analysis (i.e. misspelling, the format of the phone numbers, etc.). We also acknowledge that the information in the data may be intentionally inaccurate, such as the poster name, age and even physical appearance (e.g. the size of the bra body, weight). Figure 1 shows an actual contribution from Backpage.com. To illustrate the geographical diversity of the listings, we use Tableau1 software to visualize the potential frequency of advertising in relation to the various states in Figure 2, with a higher number of female performers."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Advertisement Language Pattern", "text": "The first group consists of various linguistic characteristics. For the first and second characteristics, we identify posts that have the language of the third person (which are morelikely written by someone other than the companion) and posts that contain plural pronouns of the first person such as \"we\" and \"our\" (which are more likely to be an organization) [6]. To ensure their anonymity, traffickers would use techniques to generate diverse information and thus make their posts appear more complicated. They usually do this in order to avoid being identified by human analysts or automated programs. [25] So, to obtain the third characteristic, we take an approach from the complexity theory, namely the Kolmogorov complexity, which is defined as the length of the shortest program to reproduce a string of characters on a universal machine such as the Turning Machine. [25] Since the Kolmogorov complexity is unpredictable, we approach the complexity of a value by first removing the contents of an ad and then the ent25 entries."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Words and Phrases of Interest", "text": "Although the advertisement on Backpage.com does not directly mention sex with children, customers who prefer children know how to search for words and phrases such as \"sweet, sweet, fresh, new in town, new in the game.\" [27,28, 29] We therefore examine within the posts whether they contain words that could be highly related to human trafficking in general."}, {"heading": "3.1.3 Countries of Interest", "text": "We can see if the person being accompanied comes from other countries, such as Southeast Asia (especially China, Vietnam, Korea and Thailand, as we have observed in our data) [3]."}, {"heading": "3.1.4 Multiple Victims Advertised", "text": "Some advertisements advertise multiple women at the same time.

In particular, we first proposed an unmonitored filtering approach to filter out the data more likely to be involved in trafficking in human beings. We then proposed a semi-supervised learner, namely S3VM \u2212 R, and trained him on a small portion of the data handlabeled by a trafficking expert. We used the trained model for identifying invisible data labels. The results suggested that our approach is effective in identifying potential trafficking-related advertising. Our future plans include replicating the study by integrating more interesting features, especially those supported by the criminal literature. As labeling unlabeled examples is costly, it would be an interesting direction of research to enable active, supervised learning to become less active with the data we normally query the normal user data, in particular."}, {"heading": "7 Competing Interests", "text": "The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}, {"heading": "8 Authors\u2019 Contributions", "text": "HA developed and implemented the human trafficking detection approach and drafted the manuscript.

Due to the lack of ground truth, we rely on a human analyst from law enforcement, for hand-labeling a small portion of the crawled data. We extend the existing Laplacian SVM and present SVM \u2212R, by adding a regularization term to exploit exogenous information embedded in our feature space in favor of the task at hand. We train the proposed method using labeled and unlabeled data and evaluate it on a fraction of the unlabeled data, herein referred to as unseen data, with our expert\u2019s further verification. Results from comparisons between our method and other semi-supervised and supervised approaches on the labeled data demonstrate that our learner is effective in identifying advertisements of high interest to law enforcement.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
