However, the effects of errors are not analyzed in depth, and these tasks aim only at identifying semantic roles between elements in the same sentences.

It showed that dependency information improves PASA. Since analyzers that use dependency information require dependency annotations and parser constructions, the cost is very high, which is disproportionate to improving accuracy, as shown in Figure 6. Experimental results showed that the indirect features that compensate for the absence of dependency features worked well enough. Taking into account the cost of generating dependency information, accuracy makes sense in realistic situations. We plan to design a framework for rapid data preparation and apply the system to a variety of areas in the future."}], "references": [{"title": "Multilingual semantic role labeling", "author": ["Love Hafdell", "Pierre Nugues"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning: Shared Task,", "citeRegEx": "Bj\u00f6rkelund et al\\.,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bj\u00f6rkelund et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Introduction to the conll-2004 shared task: Semantic role labeling", "author": ["Carreras", "M\u00e0rquez2004] Xavier Carreras", "Llu\u0131\u0301s M\u00e0rquez"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the CoNLL-2004", "citeRegEx": "Carreras et al\\.,? \\Q2004\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Carreras et al\\.", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Introduction to the conll-2005 shared task: Semantic role labeling", "author": ["Carreras", "M\u00e0rquez2005] Xavier Carreras", "Llu\u0131\u0301s M\u00e0rquez"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 9th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning,", "citeRegEx": "Carreras et al\\.,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Carreras et al\\.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Liblinear: A library for large linear classification", "author": ["Fan et al.2008] Rong-En Fan", "Kai-Wei Chang", "Cho-Jui Hsieh", "Xiang-Rui Wang", "Chih-Jen Lin"], "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research,", "citeRegEx": "Fan et al\\.,? \\Q2008\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Fan et al\\.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Training dependency parsers from partially annotated corpora", "author": ["Yusuke Miyao", "Graham Neubig", "Shinsuke Mori"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 5th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing,", "citeRegEx": "Flannery et al\\.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Flannery et al\\.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Semi-supervised semantic role labeling", "author": ["F\u00fcrstenau", "Lapata2009] Hagen F\u00fcrstenau", "Mirella Lapata"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,", "citeRegEx": "F\u00fcrstenau et al\\.,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "F\u00fcrstenau et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Centering a framework for modeling the local coherence of discourse", "author": ["Scott Weinstein", "Aravind K.
