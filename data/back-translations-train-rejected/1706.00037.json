In this paper, we extend multi-start capabilities by using the parallel processing power of the graphics processing unit (GPU) to quickly generate a diverse set of solutions to the problem of unrestricted binary quadratic optimization, which is evaluated and used to implement screening methods to select solutions for further optimizations. This method is implemented as the first high-quality solution generation phase before a secondary search for the steepest ascent, and a comparison of the results with the most common approaches to unrestricted binary quadratic problems shows that a diversified multi-start with screening quickly yields very good results."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "However, when the objective function is complex, numerous evaluations of the objective function contribute significantly to the temporal complexity of a search algorithm. One approach to reducing the temporal complexity of a combinatorial solution space is to implement a screening technique to search only those neighborhoods that are expected to provide high-quality solutions.A significant improvement has recently been made available to address these two themes.The Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a parallel computing platform and a programming model to leverage the power of the Graphics Processor Unit (GPU).This parallel computing power can drastically reduce the time required for objective function evaluation and is particularly beneficial as the problem size increases. An advantage of the ability to quickly evaluate large sample spaces is the ability to calculate effective objective function evaluation."}, {"heading": "Literature Survey", "text": "The early work with UBQP was enabled by NVIDIA to allow software developers to access the power of their PUs. The physical problems of finding basic states of spin glasses with external magnetic fields are now used by many other computers. Subsequently, the basic problems of searching for basic states of spin glasses with external magnetic fields are investigated with different application areas such as data sharing (Alidaee, et al., 2005) and machine planning (Alidaee, et al., 2005) The GPU is a multi-processor specializing in manipulated large blocks of data using, for example, 2880 cores. In contrast, the CPU specializes in general implementations of natural speech pseudo-codes that allow different logic flows, for example, 4 cores. The CUDA platform was provided by NVIDIA to allow software developers to access the power of their PUs and many of them."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The GPU enables rapid evaluation of objective functions using matrix multiplication. This capability enables the generation of a large number of multistarts and screening for initial easy optimization. In this paper, it was found that this approach very quickly generated high-quality solutions for two sets of benchmark UBQP, but generally found no best-known solutions. Therefore, the approach may place too much emphasis on diversifying the search and not enough on intensifying or improving the solution."}], "references": [{"title": "An application of combinatorial optimization to statistical physics and circuit layout design", "author": ["F.
