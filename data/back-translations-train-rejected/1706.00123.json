Given a partial MaxSAT formula F and a positive integer k, the diversified top-k partial MaxSAT is to find k maximal solutions for F such that the k maximal solutions satisfy the maximum number of soft clauses of F. This problem can be widely used in many applications including community detection, sensor place, motif discovery, and combinatorial testing. We prove the problem is NP-hard and propose an approach for solving the problem. The concrete idea of the approach is to design an encoding EE which reduces diversified top-k partial MaxSAT problem into partial MaxSAT problem, and then solve the resulting problem with state-of-art solvers. In addition, we present an algorithm MEMKC exactly solving the diversified top-k partial MaxSAT. Through several experiments we show that our approach can be successfully applied to the interesting problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 May 2017 23:37:18 GMT  (71kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00123v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["junping zhou", "huanyao sun", "feifei ma", "jian gao", "ke xu", "minghao yin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00123"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.00123.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Diversified Top-k Partial MaxSAT Solving", "authors": ["Junping Zhou", "Huanyao Sun", "Feifei Ma", "Jian Gao", "Ke Xu", "Minghao Yin"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it is so far that it will be able to the mentioned rf\u00fc the mentioned rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the"}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we will first present some definitions related to this paper.A letter is either a Boolean variable (short: variable) x or its negation \u00ac x. A positive letter is only a variable x, and the negative letter is the negation of a variable, i.e., \u00ac x. A clause is a combination of letters. The length of a clause is the number of letters that contain the clause. A clause is a unity clause if the length of the clause is 1. A formula F in conjunctive normal form (CNF) is a conjunction of clauses. The length of a formula F expressed by | F | is the number of clauses contained in the formula. Any variable in F can assume a true or false value. An assignment of truth to F is a map that assigns a value to each variable."}, {"heading": "3 Encoding", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves, and they are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "5 Applications", "text": "In this section we will partially integrate the applications of the diversified top k into the diversified top k cliqueThe problem of the diversified top k clique is to cover the maximum number of wells that cover the maximum number of wells. < This problem represents broad real-world applications including social networks, complex networks and molecular biology [13,14,15].

Dist and CCLS are excellent approximate solvers for partial MaxSAT. The time limits of EnumKOpt, k-CA, Dist and CCLS are set at 1800, 300, 300 seconds if executed once each.

Given a partial MaxSAT formula F and a positive integer k, the diversified top-k partial MaxSAT is to find k maximal solutions for F such that the k maximal solutions satisfy the maximum number of soft clauses of F . This problem can be widely used in many applications including community detection, sensor place, motif discovery, and combinatorial testing. We propose an approach for solving the problem. The concrete idea of the approach is to design an encoding EE which reduces diversified top-k partial MaxSAT problem into partial MaxSAT problem, and then solve the resulting problem with state-of-art solvers. In addition, we present an algorithm MEMKC exactly solving the diversified top-k partial MaxSAT. Through several experiments we show that our approach can be successfully applied to the interesting problem.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
