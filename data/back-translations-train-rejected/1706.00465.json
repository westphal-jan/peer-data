Introduction", "text": "This vision is shared by the authors, who claim that - for the phonetic events observed - the data used by audiobooks have more tokens than have been studied in the entire 50-year history of sociolinguistic studies of the Spanish language. \"In a similar trend, we recently demonstrated the value of stochastic and neural acoustic models for analysis, on a relatively large scale, the vowel length of two underresourced African languages [2]. Such empirical approaches allow the statistical evaluation of a much larger number of hypotheses on geographical / dialectical factors (including geographical / dialectical variations)."}, {"heading": "2. Related Works", "text": "The duration of the vowel is a phonetic measure widely used in acoustic research. Many factors influence the duration of the vowel, such as its position within the vowel space ([8], [9]), position and length of the word [10], the context of the vowel ([11], [12]), speech speed ([13], [14] and the position of the vowel within the word [15]. As explained in [16], the most important previous studies on the duration of the vowel were conducted by manual annotations. Therefore, it is a very time-consuming task and only a few words have been analyzed in general. We believe that the use of automatic tools can lead to more objective and reproducible measures, and on a larger scale. As for the contrast of the vowel length, [17] its production and perception in Korean was examined, and they found that all Korean speakers of the study, the vowels produced (length), vowel length, and short vowel length also came to a contrasting conclusion."}, {"heading": "3. Measuring Vowel Length Contrast", "text": "It is not trivial to objectively analyze the degree of bimodality in the distribution of lengths for a particular vowel, one reason being that there may be - for some vowels - much shorter occurrences than long [20]. A look at the distributions is one possibility, but more objective characteristics are required if we want to make a fine assessment of the degree of contrast between different language styles and dialects (see [18] for Japanese). This section suggests various criteria (characteristics) to estimate the degree of bimodality for the (duration) distribution of a given vowel. These characteristics are not extracted from the true distributions of short and long vowels x, but from their normalized gamma approximation2 - see Figure 1 for the notations used: (1) ratio r1, (2) ratio r2, (2) range A between both (short / long) gamma distributions, and (4) delta between the two distributions."}, {"heading": "4.

Data and ASR System", "text": "In addition to our existing internal (Dakar standard) Wolof reading corpus [22], we recently collected data during a field trip to Senegal. We collected semi-spontaneous speech from Wolof (Dakar standard) and dialectical variants. In total, we had to watch a series of 76 short videos designed to express the way [23]. These data can be considered semi-spontaneous speech. Our best Wolof-ASR system was used to decipher newly recorded language, a context-dependent DNNHMM hybrid system trained with Kaldi speech recognition tools [24]. Further details on this system can be found in [2] and it is provided by a VM3. We used 5 transcriptions of Faana-Faana (over 6) and 3 high-contrast transcriptions of Woldi tables (over 11)."}, {"heading": "4.2.

Forced Alignment with Human Transcriptions", "text": "In a first phase, we extract vowel durations using forced human transcriptions of development (dev) described in [2] (1,120 utterances, 1h12mn of speech), which are composed of Wolof language (see Table 1). However, the compulsory alignment is performed using our CD-DNN-HMM-based acoustic model (length contrasted acoustic models with different units for short and long vowels).The 7 contrasted vowels are labeled as / short / or / long / depending on the duplication of the graph within the word.The data is divided into different sentences designated by Dvl vowels, in which v-V = {i, E, a, O} is the vowel studied, and l-L = {S, L} is the expected length of the vowel (short or long).We compile vowel duration and build a histogram for each vowel duration."}, {"heading": "4.2.2. Forced Alignment with Automatic (ASR) Transcriptions", "text": "In this subsection, we try to see if manual transcriptions can be replaced by ASR hypotheses while maintaining the same trends / conclusions. In this case, we relax the limitation of manual transcriptions of the data set. We calculated vowel durations from forced alignment that we obtained with ASR transcriptions (from our Wolof ASR base system, which was trained on held-up data - about 20% WHO for the language read), and created gamma distributions as in the previous section. For each vowel, we compared both distributions (manual transcriptions against ASR transcriptions) with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test [25] (the null hypothesis H0 was that both distributions obtained after manual and ASR transcriptions are similar). For each vowel v, no significant gamma difference was found (to illustrate this result, be very similar to ASR for duration illustrations)."}, {"heading": "4.3. Analysis on Wolof Semi-Spontaneous Speech", "text": "The results are shown in Table 3.If we look at the mean duration of the vowels \u00b5, our first observation is that it is lower in the semi-spontaneous language than in the read language (for both short and long units).These conclusions were expected, but confirm that our machine-aided methodology allows usable measurements on a larger scale. Comparing \u00b5 in the read and semi-spontaneous context, we find that long vowels are most affected by the speaking style, especially for / i: /, / e: / and / E: /), while short units are least affected by the vowel set. The results for / u / must be considered with caution, as we have only 16 long occurrences, as well as for / o / ~ / o: /, where we have fewer occurrences compared to other vowels. All the calculated characteristics show that the length contrast to / O / O: / pair is significantly reduced compared to the spontaneous ones, which will be compared to the spontaneous ones in the 26 vowels compared to the spontaneous ones."}, {"heading": "4.4. Analysis on a Dialectal Variant of Wolof", "text": "As we see in Table 4, long vowels / e: / and / o: / still appear more frequently than their short counterparts, as in the semi-spontaneous (standard) Wolof. We observe that the duration increases with the height of the vowel, for long vowels (/ i: /, / e: /, / E: /) but not for their short counterparts. If we look at the value of the characteristics, we notice that the distinction between short and long pronunciation of vowels is flimsy. Meanwhile, the length contrast on vowel / O / is weakened just as in the semi-spontaneous (standard) Wolof. These results do not indicate that there is a strong opposition of vowel length in Faana-Faana, as observed in the (standard) Wolof. In the meantime, we cannot claim that the vocal length contrast does not exist in Faana-Faana. In the spontaneous / spontaneous / spontaneous analysis of this woolly effect, we are not in the position of the Diffect-Diffect, we are not in the position of the Diffect-2."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we have presented a large-scale analysis (compared to previous phonetic studies) of vowel length contrasts in Wolof. We worked on different speech styles, but also on a dialectic variant (Faana-Faana). We proposed correlated but complementary features to describe the shape of vowel length distributions and highlight different length contrasts in a vowel. Another important finding is that relaxing the limitations of transcriptions (by using ASR transcriptions instead of manual transcriptions) for the language read is possible, as it results in very similar distributions of durations. Future work will be devoted to the use of computer models and machine learning for large-scale language analysis and laboratory phonetics. Further work will analyze the relationship between these characteristics of length contrast distribution and the concept of functional stress developed by [27]."}, {"heading": "6.
