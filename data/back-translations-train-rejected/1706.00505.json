We hypothesize that an alternative approach can be used for latent variable estimation through an undirected graphical models. For instance, non-parametric artificial neural networks. In this study, we explore the use of generative non-parametric modelling methods to estimate latent variables from prior choice distribution without the conventional use of measurement indicators. A restricted Boltzmann machine is used to represent latent behaviour factors by analyzing the relationship information between the observed choices and explanatory variables. The algorithm is adapted for latent behaviour analysis in discrete choice scenario and we use a graphical approach to evaluate and understand the semantic meaning from estimated parameter vector values. We illustrate our methodology on a financial instrument choice dataset and perform statistical analysis on parameter sensitivity and stability. Our findings show that through non-parametric statistical tests, we can extract useful latent information on the behaviour of latent constructs through machine learning methods and present strong and significant influence on the choice process. Furthermore, our modelling framework shows robustness in input variability through sampling and validation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 21:58:04 GMT  (509kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00505v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["melvin wong", "bilal farooq", "guillaume-alexandre bilodeau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00505"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.00505.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Discriminative conditional restricted Boltzmann machine for discrete choice and latent variable modelling", "authors": ["Melvin Wong", "Bilal Farooq", "Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau"], "emails": ["melvin.wong@ryerson.ca", "bilal.farooq@ryerson.ca", "guillaume-alexandre.bilodeau@polymtl.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "* Presentation at the International Choice Modelling Conference 2017 \u2020 Laboratory of Innovations in Transportation (LITrans), Department of Civil Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, Email: melvin.wong @ ryerson.ca \u2021 Laboratory of Innovations in Transportation (LITrans), Department of Civil Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, Email: bilal.farooq @ ryerson.ca \u00a7 Laboratoire d'Interpr\u00e9tation et de Traitement d'Images et Vid\u00e9o (LITIV), Department of Computer and Software Engineering, Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Canada, Email: guillaume-alexandre.bilodeau @ polymtl.caar Xiv: 170 6.00 505v 1 [cs.L G] 1J un2 01"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to assert themselves, that they are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, and most of them are able to survive on their own.

Formally, the LCM election probability can be expressed as follows: P (y) = \u2211 n P (sn) P (y | x, sn) (1), where S = [s1, s2,..., sn] of the set of classes and P (sn) represents the probability that a person belongs to class s. P (y | x, sn) is the conditional probability of choosing y based on class and input variables x. The ICLV model expands the electoral model by describing how perceptions and attitudes affect real decisions, as well as the use of separate indicators to estimate latent variables between the Ben variables i and Ben-acial (can be considered as either personal or observable attributes)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Modelling through generative machine learning methods", "text": "In generative models of machine learning, hidden units h are the learned features (see Fig. 2) that perform a non-redundant generalization of the data to reduce high-dimensional input data (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006). Intuitively, hidden units in the sense of econometric analysis are latent variables that depend on some observed data, e.g. socioeconomic attributes such as weather or price information, or direct decisions such as location and purchase decision. We can construct a generative model as a function of these dependent and independent variables. In the case of factor analysis, a common process is to perform feature extraction based on statistical hypotheses to determine whether the values of the two classes are different, e.g. through the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to learn low-dimensional classes by incorporating only signed edge statistical units directly observed in 2016, or in the Poucong classes."}, {"heading": "2.3 Balancing model inference and accuracy", "text": "A common problem faced by researchers in creating latent behavioral models is determining the optimal size of latent factors (Vermunt and Magidson, 2002). Since the hypothesis of the number of latent variables cannot be directly tested, typical statistical evaluation methods such as AIC and BIC are used to guide class selection (Vermunt and Magidson, 2002), in the case of ICLV models by pre-defining measurement functions (Rungie et al., 2012). However, since the number of latent factors determines the model's ability to represent the different heterogeneities in the data, it is likely that the selection model will become more efficient as we capture complex behavioral effects from individual and latent attributes. On the other hand, if we increase the number of latent segments, the number of parameters will also increase at an exponential rate (Vermunt and Magidson, 2002)."}, {"heading": "3 Methodology", "text": "In this section we provide a brief overview of restricted Boltzmann machines and how they can be used to generate distributions before the election. We refer readers to Goodfellow et al. (2016) for background information and details on generative models and deep learning."}, {"heading": "3.1 Restricted Boltzmann machines", "text": "A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is an energy-based, undirected graphical model that extends from a Markov random field distribution by incorporating hidden variables (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007). It is a single-layer artificial neural network without internal layer connections. The model has stochastic visible variables y (0, 1} I and stochastic hidden variables h (0, 1} J. The common configuration (y, h) of visible and hidden variables is given by the hopfield energy (Hinton et al., 1984): Energy (y, h) = \u2212 I begin with yici \u2212 ici \u2212 ici \u2212 hid \u2212 hjdj \u2212 jdj \u2212 ici, (6) where dj and ci represent the vector biases (constants) for the hidden and visible vectors. The dij is the matrix of parameters that represent a hidden connection between the hidden and visible ones."}, {"heading": "3.2 Model estimation and inference", "text": "The probability that the RBM network will perform a training sample can be increased by adjusting the weights to lower the energy of this training sample and increase the energy of other non-training samples. To minimize the negative log probability of the probability distribution p (y), we take their gradient derivative of the log probability of a training vector with respect to the model parameters as follows: \"Logbook p (y) \u2202 log p (y) mps = < yihj > train \u2212 < yihj > model = + \u2212 \u03c6,\" (10) where the components in the angle brackets correspond to expectations below the specified distribution. The first and second terms are the positive + and negative \u03c6 \u2212 phases. This function updates the model parameters with a simple learning rule with a learning rate: \"We can use the components in the angle brackets (< yihj > train \u2212 < lt; ltihj > train \u2212 model).\""}, {"heading": "3.3 Modelling approach", "text": "In this paper, the proposed method uses a conditional RBM (C-RBM) training algorithm to include input connections that allow discriminatory learning (Mnih et al., 2012). C-RBM expands the model to include \"context input variables,\" i.e. p (y | x, h). k input variables are introduced as context variables so that they can be used to influence the latent variables, although Equation 14 does not reconstruct these explanatory variables. This influence is represented by a weight matrix Bik. Intuition is that for each latent variable it acts as a function of the observed choice y, conditioned on x (see Fig. 2). In the selection phase, a vector of the new input samples will generate x latent variables."}, {"heading": "4 Data", "text": "In this section, we develop a scenario for selecting financial products with explanatory variables using the C-RBM model. Deferred variables representing the deferred setting variables are estimated simultaneously with interaction with the Choice model. First, we construct a structured selection subset from a data set for the transaction of financial products from the Kaggle database. The data shows a monthly record of each financial product purchased by Santander customers. The time span of the data extends from January 2015 to June 2016. Next, we reduced the complexity of the data set by removing transaction data containing 1 data set: https: / / www.kaggle.com / c / santander product recommendation / datamultiple product selection. To ensure consistency, the inputs were scaled and normalized. In total, the constructed data set has 13 alternatives (product selection) and 20 explanatory variables."}, {"heading": "4.1 Method for assessing C-RBM model performance", "text": "Intuitively, Dij represents the parameters for the explanatory variables, and Bik represents the parameters for the latent variables. We selected models with 2, 4, 16, and 32 latent variables to observe the effects of increasing model complexity. A disadvantage of this step is that it leads to a large number of estimated parameters: (Nparameter: (I \u00b7 J) + (K \u00b7 I) + (K \u00b7 J) + K + I). With J = 4, we ended up with 409 parameters. To counteract the overpass due to this problem, we trained 70% of our data and validated the model on the other 30% with a double cross validation to verify the generalization."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "A total of 76,141 observations were used in the test. For the purpose of this study, we tested on both normalized and non-normalized data and found that both data produce similar results. Model estimation and validation were each performed using Theano ML Python library2. Optimization parameters used were stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on mini-batches of 64 samples for 400 epochs with input normalization. We used an adaptive dynamics-based learning rate of 1e \u2212 3 (Hinton et al., 2006). Training time was approximately 30 minutes for each model including validation on an Intel Core i5 workstation. In due course, the computing need may not be significant to justify the small number of hidden units, but speed may become more important consideration as model estimation and validation increases."}, {"heading": "6 Analysis", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Characteristics of latent variables", "text": "We characterize each hidden unit with the declared meaning and the strengths expressed by the weights D > D > D is a parameter vector that indicates the linear contribution of each variable and a constant D, so that each alternative can be described as a special constellation.

We hypothesize that an alternative approach can be used for latent variable estimation through an undirected graphical models. For instance, non-parametric artificial neural networks. In this study, we explore the use of generative non-parametric modelling methods to estimate latent variables from prior choice distribution without the conventional use of measurement indicators. A restricted Boltzmann machine is used to represent latent behaviour factors by analyzing the relationship information between the observed choices and explanatory variables. The algorithm is adapted for latent behaviour analysis in discrete choice scenario and we use a graphical approach to evaluate and understand the semantic meaning from estimated parameter vector values. We illustrate our methodology on a financial instrument choice dataset and perform statistical analysis on parameter sensitivity and stability. Our findings show that through non-parametric statistical tests, we can extract useful latent information on the behaviour of latent constructs through machine learning methods and present strong and significant influence on the choice process. Furthermore, our modelling framework shows robustness in input variability through sampling and validation. \u2217Paper presented at International Choice Modelling Conference 2017 \u2020Laboratory of Innovations in Transportation (LITrans), Department of Civil Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, Email: melvin.wong@ryerson.ca \u2021Laboratory of Innovations in Transportation (LITrans), Department of Civil Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, Email: bilal.farooq@ryerson.ca Laboratoire d\u2019Interpr\u00e9tation et de Traitement d\u2019Images et Vid\u00e9o (LITIV), Department of Computer and Software Engineering, Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, Canada, Email: guillaume-alexandre.bilodeau@polymtl.ca ar X iv :1 70 6. 00 50 5v 1 [ cs .L G ] 1 J un 2 01 7", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
