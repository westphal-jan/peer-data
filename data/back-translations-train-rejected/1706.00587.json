[1] Although it is generally a positive development that more and more medical and imaging equipment is available during surgery, this unfortunately also increases the surgeon's cognitive workload and the organisational complexity of the surgical team. In order to provide the available information only when it is actually necessary for the procedure, the devices need to recognise the surgical context and workflow [3]. In the field of surgical workflow detection [2], which is also an aspect of the recently defined area of surgical data science, different approaches exist. Some methods attempt to extract a structured model from recorded operations [3], while others directly attempt to use the surgical phases or activities through instrument and sensor data [4-6], laparoscopic video recordings [10-9] or a mixture of these kinematised kinematics [11]."}, {"heading": "2 Methods", "text": "RF are a collection of randomised decision trees [12]. Each tree is trained on a randomised subset of all available training data, and in each node only a randomised subset of all available characteristics is available. In this way, all trees in the forest should have a different structure. After training, each tree evaluates each sample and casts one vote, while the majority of votes determine the final classification result. Parameters for the random forest in this experiment were optimised by an exhaustive parameter sweep: the forest consisted of 80 trees with a maximum tree depth of 9 nodes. During training, each node was presented with a random subset of 8 of the 17 available characteristics. HMMs can be used to estimate the internal state of a system based on the trained network structure and to model recorded observations."}, {"heading": "3 Data and Experiments", "text": "This year, it is at an all-time high in the history of the European Union."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "In fact, we see ourselves as being able to outdo ourselves in the way we have done it in the past: in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it, in the way we have done it. \""}], "references": [{"title": "Surgical process modelling: a review", "author": ["F Lalys", "P Jannin"], "venue": "Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 9:495\u2013511", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Multi-perspective workflow modeling for online surgical situation models", "author": ["S Franke", "J Meixensberger", "T Neumuth"], "venue": "J Biomed Inform 54:158\u2013166", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2015}, {"title": "System events: readily accessible features for surgical phase detection", "author": ["A Malpani", "C Lea", "CCG Chen", "GD Hager"], "venue": "Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 11:1201\u20131209", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Automatic phase prediction from lowlevel surgical activities", "author": ["G Forestier", "L Riffaud", "P Jannin"], "venue": "Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 10:833\u201341", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Random Forests for Phase Detection in Surgical Workflow Analysis", "author": ["R Stauder", "A Okur", "L Peter", "A Schneider", "M Kranzfelder", "H Feu\u00dfner", "N Navab"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2014}, {"title": "EndoNet: A Deep Architecture for Recognition Tasks on Laparoscopic Videos", "author": ["AP Twinanda", "S Shehata", "D Mutter", "J Marescaux", "M de Mathelin", "N Padoy"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Surgical Gesture Classification from Video Data.
