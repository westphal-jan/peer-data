Miller and Ireland discuss that intuition can be corroded by two types of ability, namely an ability to make decisions about action gained through expertise."}, {"heading": "3 ICABiDAS Architecture", "text": "Based on the discussion we presented in the previous section, in this section we develop an architecture that can be used to model the \"intuition\" into the machine, thus helping not only to extract analyses from big data, but also to synthesize newer interpretations of the data. The architecture is illustrated in Figure 3. There are three important phases of the architecture, the first phase being the input phase, in which the data from sensors and / or databases are sent into the system. As we have discussed the data, they could be in different formats and have inherent faults. Therefore, the data in this phase is blocked by a \"health check\" to ensure that the data does not have an anomaly, and then the data is transformed into a universal way of representation. We propose to use a relational graph to store data as relative information, which is one of the main reasons why the human brain can process the data."}, {"heading": "4 Suggested Test-cases", "text": "There are a number of schemes and architectures available in the open literature that suggest different ways of dealing with big data. However, without a fixed number of test cases, it is of little use for engineering and community research. We believe that there are three phases to each new architecture development. In the first phase, we will present three test cases to test the intuitive ability of an implementation. In the second phase, the problem is understood and a series of test cases ensue. The scheme and the desired performance is then followed by the third phase, which is the implementation phase. In this section, we will present three test cases to test the intuitive ability of an implementation. As the field is subjected to aggressive research, we will endeavour to keep the test cases as abstract as possible."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we presented a scheme for implementing a bio-inspired architecture for managing big data. The most important innovation is the inclusion of intuition, which we believe is central to the way people are able to process and meaningfully use large amounts of sensory data. In addition to the scheme, we will also present a series of test cases to test whether a designed system has intuitive capabilities and to what extent. In our future work, we will implement social media commentary analysis with our system and validate how it works."}], "references": [{"title": "How people learn: Brain, mind, experience, and school", "author": ["J.D.
