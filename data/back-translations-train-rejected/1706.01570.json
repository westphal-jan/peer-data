Extremely limited (about zero) resources are available for these languages, not even large amounts of monolingual text data or possibly even small amounts of monolingual text data. Even when audio resources are available, difficulties arise in converting sound to text (Tratz et al., 2013; Robinson and Gadelii, 2003). In addition, the text data that can be obtained often have non-standard spellings and substantial code exchanges with other traditionally written languages (Tratz et al., 2013). In this paper, we present a method for acquiring translation lexicons via loanwords and expertise that requires zero resources for borrowing language."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to feel as if they are able to play by the rules, and that they will be able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "3 Method", "text": "rE \"s tis rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf\u00fc die rf"}, {"heading": "4 Experiments and Discussion", "text": "In our experiments, we extracted a French bilingual dictionary using the freely available English Wiktion platform 20131101 downloaded from http: / / dumps.wikimedia. org / enwiktionary. From this dump, we extracted all the French words, their pronunciation and their English definitions. Using the process described in Section 3 to convert each of the French pronunciations into a Moroccan script, we produced 8277 unique loanword candidate strings. The data used for testing consists of one million lines of user comments provided by the Moroccan news website http: / / www.hespress.com. The crawled user comments contain marokkarija in strongly coded environments. While this is a challenging setting, it is a realistic representation of the types of environments in which historically unwritten languages are written for the first time."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "With the explosive growth of informal textual electronic communication such as social media, web commentary, etc., many everyday colloquial languages that were historically unwritten are now often written in heavily coded text with traditionally written languages for the first time. However, the new written versions of these languages present significant challenges to multilingual processing technology due to OOV challenges. Nevertheless, it is relatively common for these historically unwritten languages to borrow significant amounts of vocabulary from relatively well-equipped written languages. We presented a method of loanword induction to alleviate the OOV challenges in these environments, where the borrowed language has extremely limited resources, in many cases not even significant amounts of monolingual data commonly used by previous cognates and loan word recognition methods to induce translation lexicons. This paper shows that the introduction of a Martian Dokaric-English translation system can increase the performance of the lexical French translation system over the lexical language."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank Tim Buckwalter for his support and for providing us with the initial mapping of the IPA syllables to the corresponding Arabic orthographies and the contextual adjustment rules we used in our experiments.4The LDC catalog numbers for the corpora we use are: LDC2008T09, LDC2007T24, LDC2008T02, LDC2009T09, LDC2009T03, LDC2012T14, LDC2012T06, LDC2012T17, LDC2012T18, LDC2013T01 and LDC2013T14."}], "references": [{"title": "Introduction to Arabic Natural", "author": ["Nizar Habash"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Habash.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Habash.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Linguistic constraints on", "author": ["Rabia Redouane"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Redouane.,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Redouane.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Tweet conversation annotation", "author": ["Clare Voss"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Voss.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Voss.", "year": 2013}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 0, "context": "For more information see (Habash, 2010).", "startOffset": 25, "endOffset": 39}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": "The data we used is consistent with well-known codeswitching among Arabic speakers, extending spoken discourse into formal writing (Bentahila and Davies, 1983; Redouane, 2005).", "startOffset": 131, "endOffset": 175}], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "With the advent of informal electronic communications such as social media, colloquial languages that were historically unwritten are being written for the first time in heavily code-switched environments.
