However, biometric authentication systems (e.g., face recognition, iris, retina, voice, and fingerprint) are increasingly facing the risk of being tricked by biometric tools such as anti-surveillance masks, contact lenses, vocoders, or fingerprint films. In this regard, we design a multimodal biometric authentication system named DeepKey which uses both gait and Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to provide better protection against such risks. DeepKey consists of three key components: an Invalid ID Filter Model to block invalid subjects, a Gait Identification Model to recognize Gait IDs and an EEG Identification Model to recognize EEG IDs. In particular, the first two models employ a one-class SVM algorithm and a Recurrent Neural Network based deep learning model, respectively. The third model combines autoregressive coefficients, an RNN structure, and an SVM classifier. DeepKey is trained with a gait dataset of 160,000 samples and an EEG dataset of 108,000 samples.

Currently, the most sophisticated biometric authentication technology is ngerprint-based authentication, which has been proven with high matching accuracy and has been used for decades [32]. Iris detection is another popular approach to biometric authentication due to its unique and stable authentication [39]. In 1993 Daugman [10] proposed using gabor phase information and hamming removal for iris code matching, which is still the classic iris detection method. Based on [10] a variety of research solutions [39] have emerged to improve iris authentication problems. [39] For example, Pillai et al.

In contrast to previous work, our work focuses on human gait, a spatio-temporal biometry that measures the way a person walks. On the one hand, gait can be recorded remotely without human interaction when compared with other biometric features mentioned above [47]. On the other hand, it is difficult to eliminate the presence of external factors such as clothing, walking surface, shoes, wearing studs and other environmental factors. Existing gait recognition approaches fall into two categories. One is the model-based approach [38], which models gait information with mathematical structures, and the other is the outward approach, which easily extracts characteristics independent of the mathematical structure. Due to its high accuracy and remarkable performance, gait is one of the most popular gait has been in recent years [33]."}, {"heading": "2.3 EEG based authentication", "text": "Since the EEG can be captured in a secure and non-intrusive manner, researchers have attached great importance to studying this type of brain signal.

[2] extract sets of characteristics from EEG electrodes and interhemispheric data, combine them with each other and process the internal characteristics with a support vector machine (SVM). e-study shows that EEG authentication can also be carried out with lower-cost devices.

To address this concern, multimodal biometric authentication, which combines and uses biometric features in different ways, is becoming increasingly popular. Considering the frequency, most papers select two biometrics from facial, iris and germ prints and make fusion [24, 26, 43]. In [11], an innovative combination of Gang and ACM J. Comput. Cult. Herit., Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 39. Release date: March 2017. The electrocardiogram (ECG) proves effective. Manjunathswamy et al. [34] combine ECG and Nger principles at the score level.

However, these biometric systems with advanced scientific technologies are exposed to the risk of counterfeiting. On the basis of the fake-resistance strength of both approaches, an innovative combination of EEG and gang guarantees the security and correctness of authentication systems. Furthermore, most papers do not mention their solutions for dealing with invalid subjects (e.g. a fraudster).
