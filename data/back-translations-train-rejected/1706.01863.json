(Krippendorff assign 1 for a perfect match and 0 in all other cases.) IAA2 uses Jaccard distance instead of fixed values for the above cases, which provides more realistic results when chains have heterogeneous silical sizes.

Average number of tokens and mentions per genre varies widely. In particular, the essay genre contains texts discussing abstract concepts such as \"home\" and \"science\" that are not commented on. Mentions of 2 news documents were obtained from Phase I, the others from Phase II (see Figure 1). We observe better IAA values for Phase II than for Phase I (not shown in the table), which could be due to the high ratio of documents from the Turkish news genre (7 of 12) in Phase II, mentions of 2 news documents were obtained from Phase II (see Figure 1).

We also mentioned the named Entity Recognitions (NER) module of the ITU pipeline (Eryi\u011fit, 2014), because we are not annotated in the Turkish Treebank, but we found that the output of the web service has been changed several times during the development of the baseline.

Symbol-level annotations mean that coreference between morphemes and other symbols (or morphemes) cannot be commented on. Although such coreference annotations are desirable, we have decided to reduce the complexity of the annotation task by omitting such coreference links and presenting tokens without morphological analysis to annotators. For future annotation projects, it may be interesting to extend the annotation to morphemous coreference links (morphemous coreference links). Assessment with the reference corpus tool would require the development of a novel CoNLL representation for tokens that are split within IGs. If this representation is not used for annotations, the development of a tool for such Turkish annotations (Turkish annotations) is also necessary."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We are grateful to Kemal Oflazer and Bilge Say for the support of METU-Sabanci Turkish Treebank and Dilek K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck and Sava\u015f Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m for their work and datasets, which was supported by the Turkish Science and Technology Research Council (TUBITAK) under funding agreements 114E430 and 114E777.
