CrowdFlower's hate speech dataset [1] contains 14.5K tweets, each labeled by at least three contributors. Contributors were allowed to classify each tweet into one of three classes: non-offensive (NO), offensive but not hateful (O), and offensive and hateful (OH). Of the 14.5K tweets, only 37.6% had a critical class - i.e., the same class was assigned by all contributors. In undecided cases, the majority class was selected and a class trust (fraction of posts that selected the majority class) was provided. Using this approach, 50.4%, 33.1%, and 16.5% of tweets were rated as NO, O, and OH."}, {"heading": "3 Offensive Speech Classification", "text": "In order to identify offensive remarks, we propose a fully automatic technique that divides comments into two classes: offensive and emergency offensive."}, {"heading": "3.1 Classification approach", "text": "In fact, we embed a list of offensive and hateful words identified by external data in a single vector, and then turn it into a single vector. In fact, it is as if it were a single vector in which a word can be embedded. Indeed, it is as if a word is embedded in a high-dimensional language. Indeed, it is as if it is a scalar that classifies its distance from the constructed hate-filled words as input to a random forest. Indeed, it is as if a word is embedded in a high-dimensional vector. In the way that semantic similarities between words are cultivated, it is classified as input to a random forest. This mapping is achieved by exploiting the distributed properties of words."}, {"heading": "3.2 Classifier evaluation", "text": "We present the results to (1) validate our choice of classifier and (2) illustrate the impact of our training / validation sample count on our performance.Classifier selection methodology. To identify the most appropriate classifier for classifying the scalars associated with each text, we perform evaluations using the stochastic gradient Descent, naive Bayes, decision tree and random forest classifiers. For each classifier, we divide the CrowdFlower hate speech dataset into a training / validation set (25%).We perform 10-fold cross-validation on the training / validation set to identify the best classification model and parameters (using a grid search).Based on the results of this evaluation, we select a 100-estimator-based entropy-based forest model as our classifier F1 and show more accuracy for each one of the classifiers."}, {"heading": "4 Measurements", "text": "In this section, we quantify and characterize openness in the political and general contexts in which we present our views."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We note that political discussion on Reddit - measured by the frequency of offensive comments - became increasingly less civilized during the 2016 election campaign, even though more than three-quarters of the authors of such comments appear to have come from disposable accounts. While offensive posts in political subreddits, such as the one the campaign carried, have become increasingly common, there has been no such increase in apolitical forums. This contrast provides additional evidence that the increased use of offensive comments is directly related to the increase in the general election campaign for the president. Our findings provide a unique and important illustration of the increasing incidence of political discourse during the campaign."}], "references": [{"title": "Hate speech identification", "author": ["CrowdFlower Blog"], "venue": "URL: https://www.crowdflower.com/data/h ate-speech-identification/ (Accessed May", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2017}, {"title": "Twitter taunts and tirades: Negative campaigning in the age 6  of trump", "author": ["Justin H Gross", "Kaylee T Johnson"], "venue": "PS: Political Science  Politics,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Rude democracy: Civility and incivility in American politics", "author": ["Susan Herbst"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2010}, {"title": "An Improved Non-monotonic Transition System for Dependency Parsing", "author": ["Matthew Honnibal", "Mark Johnson"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Continuity and change in civility in the house", "author": ["Kathleen Hall Jamieson", "Erika Falk"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2000}, {"title": "Is aggression contagious online? a case of swearing on donald trump\u2019s campaign videos on youtube", "author": ["K Hazel Kwon", "Anatoliy Gruzd"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 50th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2017}, {"title": "Visualizing Data Using t-SNE", "author": ["Laurens van der Maaten", "Geoffrey Hinton"], "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research,", "citeRegEx": "9", "shortCiteRegEx": "9", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality", "author": ["Tomas Mikolov", "Ilya Sutskever", "Kai Chen", "Greg S Corrado", "Jeff Dean"], "venue": "In Advances in neural information processing systems,", "citeRegEx": "10", "shortCiteRegEx": "10", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Hearing the other side: Deliberative versus participatory democracy", "author": ["Diana C Mutz"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "11", "shortCiteRegEx": "11", "year": 2006}, {"title": "In-your-face politics: The consequences of uncivil media", "author": ["Diana C Mutz"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "12", "shortCiteRegEx": "12", "year": 2015}, {"title": "GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation", "author": ["Jeffrey Pennington", "Richard Socher", "Christopher D.
