By using the \"worth knowing\" operator, we can express knowledge of individual variables, but not of the relationships between them in general. In this paper, we propose a new operator Kf to express knowledge of the functional dependencies between variables. The semantics of this Kf operator uses a functional range that imposes a limitation on what counts as a functional dependency relationship. Adapting this functional range results in various interesting logics, and in this essay we axiomatize three such logics in a single agent setting. Then, we show how these three logics can be unified by varying the functional domain relative to different agents and possible worlds.

The construction is somewhat artificial, but in the next section, we can consider this just a step of complete proof at a higher level. The main difficulty here is to refute the axiomatization of the full function domain.

Thus, the behavior of the functions onG | C | P is something that our agent can and will ignore when situations are epistemically impossible.
