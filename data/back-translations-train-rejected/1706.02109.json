RELATED WORK", "text": "A wealth of algorithms and tools for automated process discovery have emerged in the last decade [1], leading to models in different process-model notations. Several approaches have also been developed to take an object-oriented or artifact-centric view of process mining [3], [4]. However, as with monolithic process discovery, it is possible to determine causal dependencies between events occurring in different artifacts [2], [5]. It is also possible to link a stage in an artifact lifecycle to stages in related artifact lifecycles by discovering synchronization conditions [6]. Likewise, causal dependencies between events occurring in different artifacts can be determined. [Artifact interaction is defined as the interplay of states and transitions of different artifacts as part of the states and transitions of the entire process]."}, {"heading": "III. MODELLING OF ARTIFACT SYSTEMS", "text": "In this thesis, we use the concept of state machines to model processes that represent artefact systems and the life cycles of artifacts as represented in [2]. We developed the CSM Miner to support such models [9]. In terms of notation, we write \u03c3k for the k-th element of a sequence of elements from a series of S, and | \u03c3 | denotes the length of \u03c3. In terms of notation, we write s \u03c3 when s = \u03c3k for some k and \u03c3 < s,..., s \"> for concatenating \u03c3 with sequence < s,..., s.\" Additionally, we write s (i) for the value of the i-th component of s (i,)."}, {"heading": "A. Composite State Machines", "text": "A process consisting of a number of interacting artifacts is called an artifact system, and we model its behavior as a Composite State Machine (CSM). The state of a CSM is defined as the composition of the states of its artifacts, i.e. it is a vector of at least one artifact; we do not allow self-loops. Formally: Definition 1. A Composite State MachineM = (S, b, f) is a model of a process with n artifacts in which S (S1) \u00b7 Sn is a set of states, with S1,., Sn the sets of artifact states, b = (b1) is the initial state."}, {"heading": "B. Process Execution Data", "text": "The CSM models presented above provide only limited insight into the interdependencies and interactions between the artifacts whose behavior determines the process of the artifact system. There are no expected execution times for the different states or frequencies for transitions. For the process in Fig. 1, for example, an analyst might be interested in the average time that awaits the result (C) while the patient is in treatment (Y) or the difference in the probability of transition to a new test is needed (E) before and after the patient is diagnosed (X). To enrich the model with such information, we need a collection of process execution data. In this work, we assume the availability of both a CSM process of interest and a suitable collection of process instance data consisting of execution sequences of the process. Each state tries in an execution sequence, or tracks the new state of the artifact system at a given time."}, {"heading": "C. Artifact Interaction", "text": "Faced with a CSM with multiple artifacts and a log LM, we want to find interesting artifact interactions that are part of the artifact behavior. For example, if the state of an artifact cannot be advanced until a certain state is reached in another artifact, then this can be a bottleneck in the entire process, but we can infer correlations between artifact states or transitions. Based on this, we distinguish three types of artifact interaction: the execution in a log does not explicitly describe such causal dependencies between the behavior of different artifacts, but we can find correlations between artifact states or transitions."}, {"heading": "IV. ARTIFACT INTERACTION INTERESTINGNESS", "text": "As we discussed in Section II, work has been done in the field of learning association rules to develop metrics of interest that are helpful in the analysis of large groups of association rules [7], [8].

ANALYSIS GUIDANCE IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "In this section we will discuss the implementation of the analysis guide in the CSM Miner [9], a plug-in-1 in the Process Mining Framework. The CSM Miner discovers a model of the artifact system and each artifact in the input log, comments on them with residence times and frequencies, and presents them in an interactive visualization. The interaction allows the user to click on a state or transition, highlighting all other states and transitions for which supp (X \u21d2 Y) > 0, based on either P \u0432S, P \u0432T or P \u0432F. The color of the highlighting depends on conf (X \u21d2 Y). The analysis guide for exploring artifact interactions is provided below the interactive model visualization, as in Fig. 4. It provides a list of artifact interactions and for each interaction the measures discussed in Section IV are calculated."}, {"heading": "VI. EVALUATION", "text": "The measures introduced in Section IV are proposals for quantifying interest in the field of association rule learning, but it is unclear how these measures relate to the actual assessments of interest by process analysts. The aim of this evaluation is to show that the analysis guidance emphasizes behavior in real processes that is useful for understanding the process. Therefore, we compare the proposals offered by the tool with insights obtained by other researchers using traditional process mining approaches on real process data.1 They are included in the CSMMiner package of the ProM 6 Nightly Build, which is available at http: / / www.promtools.org /."}, {"heading": "A. Process Description", "text": "The events and activities in the Protocol relate to three interconnected sub-processes that can be considered interacting process artefacts: the first artefact relates to the state of the application (A states), the second relates to the work carried out by the financial institution (W states) and the third relates to the state of a potential bid that the institute may submit to the applicant (O states). This process has been analysed in several other papers [14], [15]. The overall process is as follows: The process begins with the submission of the application. An unlogged check determines whether the application is accepted in advance or immediately rejected. The application will be accepted as soon as all necessary information has been provided to complete the application."}, {"heading": "B. Results", "text": "The data from the process described above were mined by the CSM Miner and then analyzed by looking at the metrics of interest efficiency. We present a list of the top artifact interactions for several of the metrics from Section IV and explain their relevance to understanding process behavior. Such lists can be obtained in the tool by sorting them to the desired measurement. Table II shows five examples of state co-occurrences with high Conf results. There are several state co-occurrences that have a Conf score of 1, indicating that one particular artifact state always occurs in concert with another state. Not all of these are shown here because most are the result of the bid that does not change the state of o. Generally, state co-occurrences with a high Conf score are indicative of relationships between artifact states that coincide with the expected flow of the process, as described in other works. For example, when the loan is activated, the customer then accepts the loan."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we have presented an approach to objectively quantifying the interaction between artifacts in artefact-centric processes, based on measures of interest defined in the context of process models, highlighting useful or surprising interactions between artifacts, and enabling process analysts to deal with large or complex models. It has been implemented using an interactive process discovery tool, the CSM Miner, which has been shown to provide relevant insights into real process execution data. Most of the insights discussed can also be obtained using traditional process mining techniques, but they require data pre-processing to obtain structured models and a careful analysis of the behavior of these complex models. We aim to expand this work in several ways. Current evaluation is limited and provides only an indication of the usefulness of the approach in practice. We plan to provide a user study of objective measurements of interesability with minimal subjective interests for the analyzers to relate to as well."}], "references": [{"title": "Process Mining - Data Science in Action, Second Edition", "author": ["W.M.P. van der Aalst"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Discovering and exploring state-based models for multi-perspective processes", "author": ["M.L. van Eck", "N.
