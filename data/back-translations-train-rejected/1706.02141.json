In this article, we conduct an empirical task-oriented evaluation to determine how parsing accuracy affects the performance of a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis system that determines the polarity of sentences from their parse trees. Specifically, we evaluate the system using four known dependency parsers, including both current models with state-of-the-art accuracy and more innacurate models that require less computing resources. Experiments show that all parsers achieve similarly good results in the sentiment analysis task without their accuracy having a relevant impact on the results. As parsing is currently a task with relatively high computer costs, which vary greatly between algorithms, this suggests that sentiment analysts and users should evaluate the speed over accuracy in selecting a parser, and parsing researchers should examine models that further improve the speed, even at some cost."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Having successfully understood the meaning of sentences in human languages, this is a long-standing key goal in artificial intelligence (AI). Although full understanding is still a long way off, recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) are an important step in this process, as the predicate argument structure of sentences contains important information to successfully understand their semantics. A text mining system that needs to generate a report on customer reviews of phones could include statements such as \"the iPhone is much better than the HTC 10\" and \"the HTC 10 is much better than the iPhone,\" which are identical in terms of the individual words they contain. It is the syntactic structure - in this case to be the subject and attribute of the verb - that tells us which of the phones are preferred."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "We provide an overview of research into parsing and sentiment analyses relevant to this study.2.1 ParsingaDifferent linguistic theories define different ways in which the syntactic structure of a sentence can be described. In particular, the vast majority of natural language parsers in literature adhere to one of two dominant representations. In the grammar of constituencies (or phrase structure grammar), sentences are analysed by dividing them into segments, which in turn are broken down into smaller constituencies, as in the example of Figure 1. In dependency grammar, the syntax of a sentence is represented by directed binary relationships between its words, which are called dependencies that are most useful when labelled with their syntactic roles, as in Figure 2. Each of these types of representation provides different information about the sentence, and it is not possible to create a complete map of constituencies to represent or vice versa (Kahane and Mazziotta 2015)."}, {"heading": "3 Materials and Methods", "text": "3.1 Parsing Systems - MaltParser: Introduced by Nivre et al (2007), this system can be used to train transition-based parsers with greedy deterministic search. Although its accuracy has fallen short of the state of the art, it is still widely used, probably due to its maturity and solid documentation. In addition, due to its greedy nature, MaltParser uses a standard arc-eager (transition-based) parsing algorithm, which we use in conjunction with the feature optimization tool MaltOptimizer1 (Ballesteros and Nivre 2012) to optimize the parameters and train a suitable model. The trained MaltParser model uses a standard arc-eager (transition-based) parsing algorithm, where in each step the motion is selected to apply possible transitions previously obtained from a model that is faster to use than the linear model."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "Table 1 shows how much time each parser consumes to analyze the Pang and Lee (2005) corpus, and how much time it consumes overall when the SA system runs on it. Tables 3, 4, and 5 show the accuracy that each parser needs to analyze the Pang and Lee (2005) corpus when the results of each parser are used as input to the syntax-based sentiment analysis system.3 We take accuracy as a reference for the SA systems, as it is the most appropriate metric in this case since the three corpora are balanced. Specifically, we compare performance when no syntactic rules are used (which would correspond to a lexicon-based system that only summarizes the semantic orientation of individual words) in terms of what is achieved when different rules are added. The goal is to determine whether different parsers manage relevant linguistic phenomena in different ways."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this article, we conducted a task-oriented empirical evaluation to determine the relevance of analyzing accuracy to the primary challenge of sentiment analysis: polarity classification. We selected English as the target language and trained a number of standard and freely available parsers on the Universal Dependency Treebank v2.0 (McDonald et al 2013). The results of such parsers on various standard sentiment corpora are then used as input for a state-of-the-art and syntax-based system aimed at classifying the polarity of these texts. Experimental results allow us to draw two interesting and promising conclusions: (1) a better labeled / unlabeled attachment score when parsing does not necessarily imply significantly better accuracy in polarity classification when using syntax-based algorithms and (2) the parsing for sentiment analysis should focus on speed rather than accuracy as we have obtained from the LAS by using an accuracy of about 80% of the initial one (the LAS is high)."}], "references": [{"title": "Globally normalized transition-based neural networks", "author": ["D Andor", "C Alberti", "D Weiss", "A Severyn", "A Presta", "K Ganchev", "S Petrov", "M Collins"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Andor et al\\.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Andor et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Negation identification and calculation in sentiment analysis", "author": ["A Asmi", "T Ishaya"], "venue": "The Second International Conference on Advances in Information Mining and Management,", "citeRegEx": "Asmi and Ishaya,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Asmi and Ishaya", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Maltoptimizer: A system for maltparser optimization", "author": ["M Ballesteros", "J Nivre"], "venue": "S (eds) Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC\u201912),", "citeRegEx": "Ballesteros and Nivre,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ballesteros and Nivre", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Parser evaluation over local and non-local deep dependencies in a large corpus", "author": ["EM Bender", "D Flickinger", "S Oepen", "Y Zhang"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,", "citeRegEx": "Bender et al\\.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bender et al\\.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "2016) Bias and agreement in syntactic annotations", "author": ["Y Berzak", "Y Huang", "A Barbu", "A Korhonen", "B Katz"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Berzak et al\\.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Berzak et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Learning to win by reading manuals in a montecarlo framework", "author": ["SRK Branavan", "D Silver", "R Barzilay"], "venue": "J Artif Int Res", "citeRegEx": "Branavan et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Branavan et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Evaluating the impact of alternative dependency graph encodings on solving event extraction tasks", "author": ["E Buyko", "U Hahn"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Association for Computational Linguistics,", "citeRegEx": "Buyko and Hahn,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Buyko and Hahn", "year": 2010}, {"title": "A fast and accurate dependency parser using neural networks", "author": ["D Chen", "C Manning"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP),", "citeRegEx": "Chen and Manning,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chen and Manning", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Transition-based dependency parsing with selectional branching.

Sentiment analysis is one example of application for which parsing has recently proven useful. In recent years, there have been significant advances in the accuracy of parsing algorithms. In this article, we perform an empirical, task-oriented evaluation to determine how parsing accuracy influences the performance of a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis system that determines the polarity of sentences from their parse trees. In particular, we evaluate the system using four well-known dependency parsers, including both current models with state-of-the-art accuracy and more innacurate models which, however, require less computational resources. The experiments show that all of the parsers produce similarly good results in the sentiment analysis task, without their accuracy having any relevant influence on the results. Since parsing is currently a task with a relatively high computational cost that varies strongly between algorithms, this suggests that sentiment analysis researchers and users should prioritize speed over accuracy when choosing a parser; and parsing researchers should investigate models that improve speed further, even at some cost to accuracy.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
