Introduction1.1. Simplified Boardgames is the class of fairy chess-like games introduced by Bj\u00f6rnsson in [1]. Language describes turn-based, two-player, zero-sum human-like games on a rectangular board with variants of figures in a concise manner. Unlike metagames [4], simplified board games include games with asymmetrical and position-dependent moves (e.g. chess initial pairs of moves).The use of finite machines to describe game rules and thus to compute a quick and efficient calculation of all legal moves, but it causes some important limitations."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning Rules of Simplified Boardgames by Observing", "author": ["Y.
