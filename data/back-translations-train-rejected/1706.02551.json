Introduction", "text": "Automatic superimposition of words into a natural language is necessary for a variety of theoretical and applied purposes such as parsing, topic and question generation [3], speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation [13], tagset design [17], information retrieval [12], content analysis, etc. Various approaches to automatic superimposition have been used to address certain aspects of superimposition [5, 23] in predefined languages [6, 8, 9, 16, 19] or in an unspecified language [7]. Despite significant advances in the field [16, 21, 22], automatic superimposition is still a problem of formidable complexity in the world."}, {"heading": "2. Algorithms and implementation", "text": "The web service passare.ru offers a multitude of functions for the flexibilization of single Russian words, word matching and synthesis of grammatically correct text. In particular, the flexibilization of a Russian noun by number and case, the flexibilization of a Russian adjective by number, gender and case, the flexibilization of a Russian adverbs by degree of comparison is implemented. The Russian verb is the part of the speech whose terminology is by far the most complicated in the language. The presented algorithm offers the flexibilization of a Russian verb by tense, person, number and gender. It also allows to form the unpronounceable forms of a verb and to produce the imperative forms of a verb. Furthermore, the functions for the formation and inflection of active present and past participations are realized. Passive present participation is the only verb not currently supported by the website."}, {"heading": "3.

Discussion", "text": "There are several other approaches to automating Russian inflection and synthesis of grammatically correct Russian texts, e.g. [14, 16]. In addition, numerous programs attempt to automate a certain part of the language or the synthesis of a document with a rigid predefined structure [4]. Judging by publicly available information, most of these programs make use of extensively annotated corpora, which can fail if the word to be bent is sufficiently different from the elements in the databases. However, due to numerous irregularities in the Russian language, several lists of unusual linguistic objects (such as the list of unclinicable nouns or the list of verbs with strongly irregular English forms, see Fig. 1) have been compiled and used throughout the code. Whenever possible, rational descriptions of exceptional cases have been used to minimize the number of elements in such lists."}], "references": [{"title": "Automation of the English-Russian bilingual phraseological dictionaries based on arrays of bilingual texts (bilingual)", "author": ["G.G.
