With the rapidly growing RDF (Resource Description Framework) data on the Semantic Web, processing large semantic graph data have become more challenging. Constructing a summary graph structure from the raw RDF can help obtain semantic type relations and reduce the computational complexity for graph processing purposes. In this paper, we addressed the problem of graph summarization in RDF graphs, and we proposed an approach for building summary graph structures automatically from RDF graph data. Moreover, we introduced a measure to help discover optimum class dissimilarity thresholds and an effective method to discover the type classes automatically. In future work, we plan to investigate further improvement options on the scalability of the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 May 2017 11:58:31 GMT  (389kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02591v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["serkan ayvaz", "mehmet aydar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02591"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.02591.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Dynamic Discovery of Type Classes and Relations in Semantic Web Data", "authors": ["Serkan Ayvaz", "Mehmet Aydar"], "emails": ["serkan.ayvaz@eng.bau.edu.tr", "maydar@kent.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords Semantic Web \u00b7 RDF \u00b7 Graph Summarization \u00b7 Automatic weight generation"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "2 Defining Graph Summarization Problem", "text": "RDF data consists of a collection of statements that intrinsically represent a designated directed multigraph that expresses resources unambiguously. RDF statements describe resources in the form of triples consisting of subject-predicate-object expressions that describe a resource, the type of resource (type triple), or a relationship between two resources [12]. To describe resources, each RDF node that corresponds to an RDF object is represented by an IRI. Values such as strings, numbers, and data in RDF data are represented by letter nodes. A predicate in an RDF triangle is also referred to as a property of the RDF subject node V. A predicate can be one of two types: a subject of the triple element is an IRI, and the object of the triple element is a literal or an object of the Triple-I element, an object of the object identifier Triple-I, and the subject of the IRDF is also an object of the IRDF."}, {"heading": "3 Methods", "text": "The graph summarization problem can be considered a problem in identifying entity type classes. The set of entity type classes can be derived from RDF data, so that each type class in the set of entity types contains only the same or very similar entity types. In our method, entity type classes are derived from the entity type classes, i.e. the elements v in V \u00b2 can also be considered a cluster problem. On the basis of the calculated similarity measurements of the entity pairs, entities that are equal or very similar and meet a similarity threshold are combined in the same type class. Our entity similarity measurement approach is based on the intuition that graph nodes that have similar relationships to similar neighbors tend to have similar nodes.Before, we investigated methods for effectively calculating entity similarity similarities. We then developed a framework for building an automated summary approach to the graph structure of Rap4 in our current Enaph Structure]."}, {"heading": "Similarity of IRI Nodes", "text": "Intuitively, the properties of an RDF graph node are defined by its properties and the adjacent units that are connected and connected to each other by similar properties. Based on the intuition that similar IRI nodes tend to have similar properties and interact with similar adjacent nodes, the similarities of the units in our method are calculated based on the predicates of the IRI nodes, in addition to the adjacent nodes that they interact with common predicates. By neighbor, we mean that a neighbor of a graph node is another node that is \"connected\" by a predicate. Formally, a node u is connected to the node v, i.e. u is a neighbor of v, if there is a designation l-L, the l (u, v) pe-E. Therefore, a node and its neighbors are connected by a property."}, {"heading": "Similarity of Literal Neighbor Nodes", "text": "The similarity of the letters of the IRI nodes indirectly affects the similarity of the IRI nodes in the calculation of the similarity of the neighborhoods. - The neighbors of the IRI nodes can be either other IRI nodes or dictionaries. - The similarity of words in the calculation of the similarity of pairs can be beneficial, especially in datasets in which the entities are often described with dictionaries. - The similarity of letters and dictionaries is taken into account in our approximation. - A literal node can consist of two or three elements: a lexical form, a data type, a language tag and a language tag. - The language mark in a letter node is included if and only if the date type of the letter node corresponds to rdf: langString [7] It is important to note that the letters should be in the same language while they are similar to the letters."}, {"heading": "Jaccard Similarity Measure", "text": "The Jaccard similarity coefficient, also known as the Jaccard index, is a well-known statistical measure. It is commonly used to compare similarity and diversity of sample sets. Jaccard similarity is simply defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of sample sets [19]. In the case of two sets of S1 and S2 in a data set, the Jaccard similarity J (S1, S2) between S1 and S2 is formulated as follows: J (S1, S2) = | S1, S2 | | S1, S2 | (2) In calculating the Jaccard similarity in the RDF data, the subject nodes themselves or the subject nodes that are in the set. Thus, the subject of the triples determine the set. Similarly, the properties of the triples whose subject is the name or label of the subject determine the subject node itself or the subject nodes that are in the group of the subject node, the group of the subject in the subject node, during the group of the subject."}, {"heading": "RoleSim Similarity Measure", "text": "The Jaccard similarity has a limitation when applying the Jaccard index to an RDF graph. However, since the Jaccard index determines the similarity only by the number of common set elements, treating the subject nodes as set pairs and the subject nodes as set pairs, it does not consider the relationships between set elements. The intuition in RoleSim similarity measurement is that two nodes or entities tend to play the same role when interacting with equivalent set pairs. In the face of a regular, unlabeled graph G = (V, E), RoleSim measures the similarity of each pair of nodes in V based on their neighborhood similarities."}, {"heading": "Combined Pairwise Entity Similarity Measure", "text": "However, in order to measure the similarity of the neighbors, we must improve the initial similarity of the neighbors by a common measurement by comparing them with the neighboring nodes (s1, t).

For example, the Linking Open Data [6] project already comprises more than 30 billion triples. In the future, we plan to address the performance problems of large datasets in the worst-case scenario and perform evaluations on a web scale.

We have described our pairwise calculation of the similarity of graph nodes to property and string weights, together with the Metric Class Predicate Stability, which allows to evaluate the degree of consistency of each class predicate in the summary graph. Furthermore, we investigated how to automatically obtain the optimal value of the class difference threshold in summary graphs. Based on our research, a measure for determining the optimal class difference thresholds and an effective method for automatically detecting the type classes was introduced. Using a number of real-world data sets, we evaluated the effectiveness of our approach to automatically summarizing graphs. For future work, we plan to focus on the scalability of the proposed method in very large datasets.

adoption in the recent years have accelerated the progress incorporating explicit semantics with data on the Web. With the rapidly growing RDF (Resource Description Framework) data on the Semantic Web, processing large semantic graph data have become more challenging. Constructing a summary graph structure from the raw RDF can help obtain semantic type relations and reduce the computational complexity for graph processing purposes. In this paper, we addressed the problem of graph summarization in RDF graphs, and we proposed an approach for building summary graph structures automatically from RDF graph data. Moreover, we introduced a measure to help discover optimum class dissimilarity thresholds and an effective method to discover the type classes automatically. In future work, we plan to investigate further improvement options on the scalability of the proposed method.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
