INTRODUCTION", "text": "Scheduling is a method by which thread or process gain access to computer resources. Operating system is responsible for planning a process. Scheduling becomes necessary and important task when we have more than one ready to perform work. Scheduling optimizes the use of resources. Criteria for selecting the best scheduling algorithm vary according to the type or preferences of the task. Five basic features for deciding on the best scheduling algorithm are as follows [1, 2]: Use of the CPU time Turning around Time Waiting Time Response Time This paper only takes into account average waiting time and average lead time for the purpose of benchmarking performance. The organization of the paper's test is as follows: In Section 2 we perform three scheduling techniques called SJF, Priority Planning and Fuzzy-based priority planning. Next section proposes a modified fuzzy-based scheduling algorithm and a set of fuzzy rules before Section M. Gives him the results of some case studies based on J. Finally, here is a Ktha in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2. SCHEDULING TECHNIQUES", "text": "Scheduling algorithms [3, 4] can be divided into different categories depending on their application. How: Preventive / Non-Preventive Techniques - In the case of a preventive scheduling algorithm, the scheduler can stop / move the execution of a task, but in the case of non-preventive algorithms it is not possible to voluntarily give up resources until the completion of the job or the execution of the job [2, 3]. Static / Dynamic Priority Planning - static priorities do not change, but dynamic priorities can be changed.This paper considers three scheduling algorithms Shortest Job First, Priority Planning and Fuzzy-based CPU Scheduling Algorithm. Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm: This algorithm plans jobs according to their execution time, job with the lowest execution time scheduled first and job with the longest execution time scheduled last. This is a non-preemptive algorithm known as its variant."}, {"heading": "3. FUZZY LOGIC", "text": "Unlike classical sets (classical sets assume true or false values), fuzzy logic variables (also known as linguistic variables) can have a truth value that varies between 0 and 1. Fuzzy logic has been extended to capture the concept of fractional truth, where the truth value can lie between completely true and completely false. If linguistic variables are practiced, these degrees can be determined by specific methods [6]. In recent years, the use of fuzzy systems in the real world has increased due to the fact that fuzzy systems affect linguistic knowledge alongside numerical knowledge. Today, an oversized range of researchers is shifting toward fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic has proven to be a strong design and analysis method in control theory that enables the implementation of advanced scientific control methods."}, {"heading": "4. PROPOSED ALGORITHM", "text": "This planning deals with some fuzzy rules and these rules are based on assigned priority and execution time. This paper proposes to calculate the new priority (NP) for all tasks with priority and execution time using Mamdani type queue. < This paper uses appropriate linguistic variables as input and output for calculating a crisp value for new priority. Pre Priority (PP) measured as Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High. Execution time (ET) measured as Very Small, Medium and Very Long. New Priority (NP) measured as Very Low, Medium, Very High and Very High. The proposed planning is a collection of linguistic fuzzy rules describing the relationship between defined input variables (PP and ET) and Output (NP). The table contains 25 rules based on IF THEN statement such as: -IF PP is High and ET is Small THEN NP is High."}, {"heading": "5. RESULT AND PERFORMANCE OF MODIFIED FUZZY BASED SCHEDULING", "text": "In order to evaluate the performance and applicability of the fuzzy-based scheduling algorithm, we have taken different case studies and compared some scheduling algorithms such as SFJ, priority algorithm, fuzzy-based CPU scheduling algorithm and the proposed fuzzy-based scheduling algorithm. Case study 1 from [1] and case study 2 is an independent example. Table 2 contains a case study with five different processes with different execution time and priority.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Figures 5 and 6 show the comparison between SJF, priority planning algorithm, fuzzy-based CPU planning algorithm and proposed new fuzzy-based planning algorithm. The average waiting time and average lead time of the proposed fuzzy-based algorithm is much better than the priority algorithm, fuzzy-based CPU planning algorithm and closer to the SJF algorithm, but the SJF algorithm does not address task priority. Figure 7 shows the comparison between SJF, fuzzy-based CPU planning algorithm and proposed new fuzzy-based planning algorithm. Results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper is much better than existing algorithms."}, {"heading": "7. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] Kadhim, Shatha J., and Kasim M.
