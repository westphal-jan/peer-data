INTRODUCTIONThe increasing ability to evaluate real-time actions related to player interactions and intelligent agents in digital games makes it attractive to explore, study, develop and test various computer techniques - from artificial intelligence (AI) to classic human behavior [2] and statistics such as machine learning (ML). In recent years, digital games have been used for such a task [3], [4]. Furthermore, [5] adds that for computer researchers, the abstract character of games makes them objects of attraction for the study of algorithms, and players are generally limited to a small number of possible actions defined by a set of small and precise rules. Finally, the quality of a digital game is directly related to its entertainment value, and this, among other things, the data, is difficult to obtain with this game [7 being interactive with the science]."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORKS", "text": "In recent years, the market for digital games has been transformed by elaborate graphics and sound effects, which means that the game industry has focused on developing powerful graphics cards."}, {"heading": "A. World of Warcraft", "text": "MMO, acronym for Massively Multiplayer Online, has revolutionized the most important digital games in the world, in particular by increasing the number and variety of players [25]. These games bring thousands of players together in an environment where they can easily interact with each other. There are several sub-classifications of MMO. In particular, the MMORPG, or Massively Multiplayer Online Rolling Game, is the most widely used. In this case, there is a continuous and parallel virtual world in which players are represented by customizable avatars. World of Warcraft (WoW) featured in this work, as shown in Figure 2, is considered the most played MMORPG in the world, with around 8.3 million active players. WoW was released in November 2004 as a sequel to the series of Warcraft games, by Blizzard Entertainment. Since its launch, the game has received several patches from the expansion, including The Burning Crusade Monsters."}, {"heading": "III. METHODOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT", "text": "In this study, we used the data set collected in [8]. The original data set has 12 attributes: date / time, user ID (protecting player privacy), guild (or group to which the player belongs), level, race, class, zone visited, and three dummy attributes. Data was collected every 10 minutes for 1,107 days (from January 2006 to January 2009), prior to the release of the Cataclysm patch (i.e., the maximum possible development in the game was 80). We first examined the data to better understand it. Then, we produced information with a better potential for classification than the original data, with particular interest in obtaining useful information to assist in classifying the four categories associated with Bartel's behavior. Thus, the attributes \"user ID,\" \"\" race, \"and\" class \"were retained and the attribute\" that we classify as socialized \"was converted over the total time analyzed."}, {"heading": "A. Used Technologies", "text": "We chose RapidMiner as an analysis tool for several reasons: it is a consolidated package on the market (work began in 2001), it has a large installed user base (more than half a million) and active communities for immediate support; it has been recognized by KDnuggets [28] as the best tool for data mining and in 2013; it has more than 500 operators for all professional analysis purposes; and finally, it is presented as a tool with an easy-to-learn curve."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "The datasets used in [8] show 91,065 players and 667,032 different sections of the game that contain only the data of the Horde. < What the datasets contain is not the data associated with the exchange of messages between players that would help to identify the behavior of Bartle. < What the new processed datasets, as shown in Figure 4, are possible to obtain other useful information that is important to identify the behaviors explained in the previous section, such as \"evolution\" speed of evolution \"and others. Following the observations of Bartle, we pursued the following guidelines for each behavior: \u2022 Killer: high level, few cards, but high level or in the case of PvP, high level cards; \u2022 Socializer: Beginners, cards stagnated in Neutrals or newcomers, when developments are presented, this is the basic level to Neutrals (fast and neutral), but not more; Achieved cards: high level, but stagnated cards: high level, P, but stagnated cards on all levels."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "The work here was to develop a methodology to explore the behaviors of the players [1], and then to assess the impact of the relationship between the players for this game. To this end, we used the data material dedicated to each player: new areas / cities to chat and play, tougher enemies for the players, more complex solutions for the players to improve the interactivity of the players."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Digital games are one of the major and most important<lb>fields on the entertainment domain, which also involves cinema<lb>and music.
