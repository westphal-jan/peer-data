Evaluating the Difficulty Level", "text": "According to Andrade et al. (2005), there are several different approaches to dynamically balance the level of difficulty of a game. However, all of these approaches require a measurement, implicit or explicit, of the level of difficulty that the player has in front of him at that moment. This measurement can be done by using heuristics, for example, the success rate of the skill landing, the capture of enemy points, the time used to complete a task or other metric that can evaluate the player. Missura and Ga \ufffd rtner (2009) established a relationship between game duration, health and outcome in such a way that there are assessment criteria that adjust the game difficulty. Demasi and Adriano developed a heuristic function called \"Challenge Function,\" which is responsible for describing the state of the game, and try to show how hard the game is for the player in a given time."}, {"heading": "3. Multiplayer Online Battle Arena", "text": "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, also known as Action Real-Time Strategy, or simply as MOBA, is a genre derived from Real-Time Strategy (RTS), as a modification of the original game. The first known MOBA game is Aeon of Strife, which comes from the game Starcraft. In this game, the player should select a unit and work his / her way to conquer the base of the enemy with the unit chosen and its special powers. This game structure has been maintained by improving the MOBAs. An interesting fact is that these games have emerged from simple fan games to become one of the most played genres in the world, as will be discussed later in this section. Another interesting fact is that according to Johnson et al. (2015) and Kwak et al. (2015) MOBA games offer less autonomy, more frustration and more challenges for the players. These findings in terms of autonomy seem most likely to be a function of the fact that MOBA games involve fair competition with other players."}, {"heading": "3.1. History", "text": "In fact, most players who are able to create a fantasy world beyond the boundaries of the original game, where Aeon of Strife was, present a unique characteristic that caught the attention of RTS players. Instead, they focus on gathering resources and building the base, the ability to control a single unit, a skill known as micromanagement. Aeon of Strife was the first step in attracting players \"attention."}, {"heading": "3.2. Gameplay and Characteristics", "text": "In order to provide challenges that correspond to the skill of the player, it is necessary to understand the gameplay that the game involves. MOBA game can be grouped into two teams that play against each other: Team 1 and Team 2. The players of Team 1 are located at the southwest corner of the map, and those of Team 2 are located at the northeast corner. Each base is defended by towers and waves of NPC units (called crawls) that guard the main routes to their base, called alleys. In the middle of each base, there is a main structure. This structure is the goal of the game, which the enemy must destroy in order to win the game. Teams consist of five players, in which each player controls a specific and powerful unit with unique abilities, called Hero or Champion. In most MOBAs, the players in each team choose one of dozens of heroes, each of whom must be equipped with different skills and tactical advantages in order to gain gold. 2http: / / goo.gl / 6fXMDScenario is highly selective for the individual team: It is highly selective for the team-oriented to gain points."}, {"heading": "3.3. Map", "text": "The map is divided into three different tracks, the upper, the lower and the middle track. Each of these tracks leads to the base of the other team, guarded by towers along the way. Figure 4 represents a general MOBA map with its lanes, bases and towers along each track. This practice is called Jungle. This is where neutral reptiles can be found that are killed for collecting more gold and experience points. It is possible to ascend by killing reptiles in the jungle instead of in the lanes. This practice is called Jungle. During the early Language phase of the game, most players are centered around \"farms.\" It means that players focus on collecting resources and defeating their heroes, such as critters or heroes, they go through the jungle and kill, they go through the jungle and kill neutral units."}, {"heading": "3.5. Game Adaptations", "text": "In order to use the game Defense of the Ancients as a test field, some adjustments have been made to better meet the needs of this work. The original game allows the player to choose his hero from 110 different options, but for this work we have decided to limit this amount to only 10 heroes, which are evenly distributed between both teams.Each hero has different characteristics, behaviors and abilities. In order to better focus on strategies and skill development, we have designed our artificial intelligence agent to be able to control a particular hero. The selection was made randomly and the character chosen is Leo - The Demon Witch. Based on this choice, it was possible to specify which skills and behaviors should be implemented so that the artificial intelligence agent would work with a uniform behavior during the game. Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the character Leo - The Demon Witches during a game.The DotA game also offers a variety of game modes that are selected randomly by the game creator."}, {"heading": "3.6.

Methodology", "text": "Our difficulty adjustment mechanism consists in the development of three different levels of artificial intelligence, which are selected during the game to present challenges that correspond to the abilities of the player. In order to select the right opponent, a difficulty assessment is performed during the game, and if it shows that the players are not evolving at the same pace, it performs the necessary adjustment. In this section, we cover the developed artificial intelligence agent, the game characteristics, the difficulty assessment process and the mechanism for dynamically adjusting the presented difficulty during a game."}, {"heading": "4.1.

Difficulty Evaluation Process", "text": "A difficulty assessment process has been developed to be carried out during the game and to indicate when players are not evolving at the same pace. To do this, it was necessary to observe which game characteristics should be analyzed and how the information from each of them can be used correctly. In the following, the analyzed characteristics and the evaluation process are described."}, {"heading": "4.2.1. Game Features", "text": "In order to evaluate a game, it is crucial to determine which characteristics can represent the performance of the players and are relevant for the evaluation. In our testbed, we have identified three important characteristics that can illustrate the behaviour of the player during a DotA match. These characteristics are: Hero's Level, Hero's Death and Towers Destroyed. Each of these characteristics is described in the following paragraphs: Hero's Level. This characteristic represents the development of the player during a match in which the value of the level is higher, the stronger the character is. Although this characteristic represents evolution, it should not be the only analysed characteristic, because it is possible that the player raises the level of his hero without really increasing his abilities. For example, the player can keep the hero closer to battles without engaging in any combat, and thereby gain some experience points shared among allies who are closer to the battle and help the hero to develop his level."}, {"heading": "4.2.2. Tracking Player\u2019s Performance", "text": "In order to make a dynamic difficulty adjustment, it is necessary to evaluate the game from time to time and check whether the game presents challenges that are suitable for the performance of the player. If the player performs poorly, the game should be able to recognize this and reduce its difficulty. Likewise, if the player develops faster than the challenges presented, the game should increase its difficulty. Once we have defined the game characteristics that need to be analyzed, this process can be summarized in the creation of a heuristic function that keeps track of the player's performance and informs when it is necessary to adjust the difficulty. This heuristic function will be our evaluation method during the game and from now on it will be called an evaluation function. In view of the aforementioned characteristics and the influence that each represents on the performance of the player, we have: P (xt) = Hd is the difference between the values and the values (Hd \u2212 Td) important."}, {"heading": "4.3. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment Mechanism", "text": "The proposed mechanism is the key to making the adjustment work properly during the game. So far, we have only shown how to check whether the player's performance is matched to a particular opponent or not, the main task of the implemented mechanism being to analyze the \u03b1 value and perform the difficulty adjustment at the time of the game or not. The mechanism works by evaluating the \u03b1 variable and constantly checking whether this variable is within the \u03b2 range, where \u03b2 is the limit of the rating function, which means to what extent a player can perform better than the other player without taking into account the imbalance. If the value of | \u03b2 | is a large number, the adjustment will be less frequent, as it may take some time to overcome \u03b2. Likewise, if | \u03b2 | is a small number, the adjustment will be more frequent, as it is easier to overcome \u03b2."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments: Agents vs Agents", "text": "In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, a series of experiments were carried out in which the performance of the players was analysed together with the behaviour of their heroes. Also, the dynamic adaptation mechanism was observed, as well as its variations and effects on the games. In each experiment, we carried out 20 games of the game, with the static Agent of Artificial Intelligence controlling one team against the dynamic Agent of Artificial Intelligence controlling the other (Figure 16 at the end of this section shows a summary of the games). \u03b2 limits for triggering the artificial intelligence switch were set to \u2212 1 and 1. Therefore, each time the performance difference (\u03b1) exceeds the \u03b2 limits, the difficulty of dynamic artificial intelligence should be modified accordingly. These values were determined empirically after a large number of tests were carried out and the results contained in the gamelogs were observed, and were not changed during these experiments."}, {"heading": "5.1. Baseline", "text": "First, we conducted an unbalanced game to determine a baseline that can be compared with the results obtained from all three experiments. This basic game is determined by two different AI agents with static behavior, one of them is in the simple mode, which represents a player without experience, and the second is in the hard mode, which represents a very experienced player. Results of this game are shown in Figure 8, where the difference between the two performances is noticeable. The player / agent is measured according to his current state during the game. Positive peaks represent moments when the agent improves his performance compared to his last state. Similarly, negative peaks mean that the agent has reduced his performance based on his last state."}, {"heading": "5.2. Easy x Adaptive", "text": "In this first set of experiments, player A was set with the simple mode, which simulates a newcomer, while player B was set with the adaptive AI, starting with the regular mode and switching to the other player's performance. Figure 10 shows the performance of both players during this game (P \u2032), while Figure 11 shows the results of the rating function (\u03b1) and the difficulty adjustments made during the game.As previously mentioned, the performance of the player is measured by taking into account his current state during the game.The positive peaks represent moments when the player improves and negative peaks mean that the player has decreased due to his last game state.Figure 10 shows that the adaptive artificial intelligence agent (player B) has managed to keep his performance similar to his opponent, the simple mode player A.In Figure 11 we can track how well the adaptive player (player B) has managed to be compatible with player A during the game. If the rating function shows negative peaks, this difficulty should be adjusted by 85%, which means that the difficulty should be high (85%)."}, {"heading": "5.3. Regular x adaptive", "text": "In the second set of experiments, we used artificial intelligence agents designed to control two players, one from each team. Here, we managed to simulate an intermediate player with player A by using a static artificial intelligence agent in regular mode. In the case of player B, we applied the proposed mechanism and launched it in regular mode. Figure 12 shows the performance of both players (P \u2032) during a single game. Similarly, Figure 13 shows the results of the rating function (\u03b1) during the game and the difficulty adjustments made during game.The analysis carried out in this set is quite similar to the previous one. The positive peaks represent moments in which the player had improved, and negative peaks mean that the player has decreased his performance.In Figure 12, we can observe that the adaptive artificial intelligence agent (player B) tried to follow the performance of his opponent (player A) by presenting similar peaks at short intervals. In Figure 13, we can track all adjustments during the game."}, {"heading": "5.4. Hard x adaptive", "text": "As already mentioned, the adaptive player started in regular mode and changed his behavior during the game to keep the game balanced. Figure 14 shows the performance (P \u2032) of both players during a game. Similarly, Figure 15 shows the results of the rating function (\u03b1) during the game and the adjustments made during the game to the levels of difficulty. In analyzing the results from Figure 14, the adaptive player started to perform better than Player A. Therefore, it was determined that the difficulty should be reduced in order to maintain balance (Figure 15). Afterwards, they kept their performances very close and the difficulty alternated between the simple mode and the regular mode until Player A could present himself better / stronger than Player B. The opposite is also apparent when Player B continued to switch between regular mode and hard mode to achieve the performance of Player A. In addition, after analyzing the score from each game we observed, they switched to improve the success of the game (45% of the game won)."}, {"heading": "5.5. Discussion", "text": "Despite the good results, not all cases showed the expected results, resulting in unbalanced games. To reach this conclusion, we observed all the games played and studied all the game reports collected. These game reports followed the game every 15 seconds and recorded the current situation of both teams, their characteristics, their values and other information. After the game was finished, we started to translate this collected information, compared the values of both heroes and made the necessary assumptions. Considering all the experiments carried out, 10% of them were unbalanced because the mechanism took too long to make each adjustment, resulting in a large performance difference between the players. As the players approached a balance, the game ended. On the other hand, 5% of the experiments carried out were unbalanced due to an excess of adjustments. In these scenarios, the adjustments were made too quickly, which resulted in player B not developing properly during the game, resulting in an easy game for the player. On the other hand, after all the experiments were carried out, the results were more similar to those of the 16 games."}, {"heading": "6. Experiments: Agents vs Users", "text": "We conducted tests with users in order to assess the quality of the effectiveness of the implemented mechanism, the aim of which is to verify, according to the perception of the player, whether the mechanism can balance the difficulty of the game in terms of their skills and whether this approach stimulates his / her entertainment. To make the tests more objective, we have registered only users who have played the game Defense of the Ancients (DotA) at least once, in order to avoid problems in understanding interface elements and / or game mechanics. The tests included inviting users to play two games of the game Defense of the Ancients (DotA), where their main goal was to defeat the opposing team. However, they were told that the outcome of the game was not decisive for the experiment, as we were more interested in behavioural problems generated by the game."}, {"heading": "6.1. Pre-test evaluation", "text": "During the tests, all users were instructed to answer a series of questions in order to create profiles according to their habits, preferences and experiences. These questions were asked on the questionnaire prior to the test and its main objective is to try to identify similarities between the behaviour of the volunteers during the experiments.In total, eleven male users took part in the experiments, one of whom is younger than 18 years old, two are between 18 and 21 years old, four are between 22 and 25 years old and the last four are between 26 and 29 years.In terms of their education level, seven were still in high school, seven were studying or graduated from higher education and one had a master's degree. To verify their experience with digital games, we asked which game genres the users have recently played the most. The most popular genres were platform games and RPGs, which were selected by 90.9% of the volunteers, followed by First Person Shooter (FPS) and sports with 81.8% of the users. In third place, there is real-time user strategy (2.3%), the only 2.3% of the users were selected."}, {"heading": "6.2. Post-test evaluation", "text": "It is indeed the case that we are able to go in search of a solution that is capable of finding a solution that meets the needs of the people and that meets the needs of the people."}, {"heading": "6.3. Discussion", "text": "The main objective of these experiments was to assess the effectiveness of the implemented mechanism qualitatively, although we could determine whether it can balance the difficulty of the game for each player, and whether this can really have an impact on the player's entertainment. Therefore, we provided two types of cards, one with the dynamic agent and another with the static agent. After analyzing the results of all players, we informally asked both experts to play on the other card as well, so that we could assess their perceptions regarding both agents. After comparing the experiences they had on each card, they said that the opponent of card A (dynamic agent) presented a more fluid behavior and they preferred to play against him. They also explained that both cards were not very challenging for them and maybe it could be more suitable for players with little experience. With this feedback, we believe that our agent in the current state has enough expertise to play against inexperienced players, so that they may not be able to the game style of play they want to learn while observing the players."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "The Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment consists in an alternative to defining the game challenges levels. This adjustment is done dynamically so that it is possible to track the skills of the player and adapt during the game runtime. The presented work aimed to increase the entertainment of the player by creating a mechanism that adapts the behavior of the player to his abilities. This mechanism was implemented on a MOBA game called Defense of the Ancient (DotA). After conducting experiments that simulate the behavior of the three main actors (beginner, regular and experienced), it was possible to verify that the dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism could keep up with the abilities of the player."}, {"heading": "8.

Although MOBA is currently one of the most played genres around the world, it is known as a game that offer less autonomy, more challenges and consequently more frustration. Due to these characteristics, the use of a mechanism that performs the difficulty balance dynamically seems to be an interesting alternative to minimize and/or avoid that players experience such frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism for MOBA games. The main idea is to create a computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player performance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience. This is done by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric based on some game features and switching the difficulty of the opponent\u2019s artificial intelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were performed and the results showed that the system is capable of adapting dynamically to the opponent\u2019s skills. In spite of that, the qualitative experiments with users showed that the player\u2019s expertise has a greater influence on the perception of the difficulty level and dynamic adaptation.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
