Despite this simple concept, this game genre has a complex gameplay and requires a lot of knowledge that may not be so familiar to beginners [Yang et al. 2014]. They should understand how to walk, cast spells, draw final conclusions, sneak enemies, attack, itemize, among other things. Resource management needs to be done, such as the use of mana, energy and gold, and players should understand how to build their hero and plan strategies based on these characteristics. Games often present a tutorial that presents the most important gameplay, with the goal of teaching newcomers how to play."}, {"heading": "2 MOBA Games", "text": "Before describing our approach, it is important to present the gameplay, characteristics and features of MOBA games. We also discuss the profile of the player playing this game genre in general and their behavior in the community."}, {"heading": "2.1 General Description", "text": "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena is a genre that has its origins in Real Time Strategy (RTS) games, in which players control a unit (hero) in a map and take part in a battle to destroy an enemy base, like a capture the flag game. As the popularity of RTS games increased over the last decade, players began to develop custom maps and features for games, called MODs, using tools distributed with the game. Thus, a custom map of Starcraft was the starting point of MOBA games, leading to Aeon of Strife. The popularity of this genre grew and users of similar games began to develop similar maps. Defense of the Ancients (DotA) was one of those maps that emerged from Warcraft III. DotA was so successful that its name was used to describe the genre for a long time, similar to DotA-like games. The term MOBA of the League only came up in 2009, when Games Riot was used to describe its 2013 debut."}, {"heading": "2.2 Community", "text": "In Warcraft III, it is very common to kick players out of games if they are identified as beginners. However, since DotA evolved from Warcraft III, it is also possible to kick players out of games that have already become popular in online environments, the common sandbox has been kept in a P2P architecture where one player is the host and other players are able to connect with their game. As a result, most players have been able to connect games where there are already players who know the game environment and the mechanics very well. Instead of being friendly and patient with newcomers, experienced players are typically bullied [Kwak et al. 2015], [Surfing and Kwak 2014] properties of RTS players associated with modern MOBA games."}, {"heading": "3 Related Work", "text": "Most players succeed because they claim to have learned less than others because they have not understood the features at all. In Dota 2, for example, there is a tutorial in which the player finds a wide range of mechanisms that can be found in modern games. MOBAs have also joined the tutorial phenomena, as they are usually more difficult to learn than the simple games. In Dota 2, for example, there is a tutorial in which the player has a tutor that can be found in the most important game functions. MOBAs have the tutorial phenomena, as they are usually more difficult to learn than the simple games."}, {"heading": "4 Implementing a Tutor Bot for MOBA Games", "text": "The first step in our implementation was to find a suitable MOBA platform, most of which are commercial games and do not offer tools to implement novel game styles or modes. We then chose third-party funding to develop the tutorial system, thereby developing our approach with Bot of Legends (BoL) as a third party. BoL only has access to the information that players have."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experiment 1: Playing alongside human players", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to demonstrate that they are able to achieve their goals and that they are not able to achieve their goals."}, {"heading": "5.2 Experiment 2: Survey and play with controlled players", "text": "To evaluate our approach, we conducted some experiments with players. We invited random players to join our agent in two games. In the first game, the player played alongside the agent without the tip system. In the second game, the player played with the tips. We have a set of six players, all between 18 and 24 years old. In the first survey, we collected data from their experiences with MOBA and League of Legends. The experience of these players could show how well they could evaluate our system. We asked players about their experiences with MOBAs, all of whom were between 18 and 24 years old. In the second survey, we collected data from their experiences with MOBA and League of Legends. The experience of these players showed that they could evaluate our system."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this essay, we addressed the problem of helping newcomers with the features and mechanics of MOBA games aimed at improving their entertainment by developing an artificial intelligence-driven agent to accompany the players and tip them. We kept the agents in League of Legends Live servers within a brand new account aimed at finding new players to join the game. This approach showed that players improve their performance when playing with friendly partners who are willing to teach them the game features. In addition, we introduced our agent alongside selected players, with a set size of six. These players answered two surveys related to their previous experiences with MOBA and experiences with the tutor. They were also invited to play two games along the agent. Results show promising results to help new players as these players evaluate that the agent worked well as support. They also reported that the frequency of tips is balanced in most cases."}], "references": [{"title": "Stfu noob!: predicting crowdsourced decisions on toxic behavior in online games", "author": ["J.
