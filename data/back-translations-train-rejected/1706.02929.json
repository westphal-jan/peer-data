One of the arguments against MTE is related to Shafer's attitude toward frequencies. Shafer in [30] contends that probability theory has evolved in recent years from the old-fashioned frequencies toward modern subjective probability theory within the framework of Bayesian theory. Analogously, he contends that the very attempt to consider the relationship between MTE and frequencies is old-fashioned and outdated, and should at least be prohibited - for the sake of humanity's progress.

This approach is of limited use, since not every set of lower and higher probabilities leads to Bel / Pl functions [16], thereby establishing a unidirectional relationship between probability theory and DS theory. According to our interpretation, the Bel / Pl function pair can be regarded as a kind of interval approximation to some \"intrinsic\" probability distributions, which, however, cannot be accessed by practicable measurements and which are of interest only as a kind of qualitative explanation for the physical quantities actually measured. Therefore, another approach was to treat them as an upper / lower wrapping for the realization of probability functions [16], [9]."}, {"heading": "6 Inner and Outer Measures", "text": "Another approach was to treat Bels / Pl in probability structures and not in probability spaces. [8] Here, the DS rule could be justified as one of the possible outcomes of independent combinations, but no stronger properties were available. This is due to the already mentioned fact that the exclusion of empty intersections actually makes most conceivable processes dependent. Please note that, according to our interpretation, no such ambiguity occurs, because we not only drop empty overlapping objects, but also relativize the remaining ones, so that any probability calculated retrospectively does not apply to the original population. Therefore, an attempt was made to drop the DS rule in the probability structures as a whole, but then it was not possible to find a meaningful rule for multi-level thinking. [11] This is a very important negative result. Since the Dempster-Shafer theory is solid in this respect and has many useful properties (as mentioned in the introduction), it should be searched for an interpretation that corresponds to the omaxial system of the DS, rather than its multiple interpretation."}, {"heading": "7 Rough Set Approach", "text": "An interesting alternative interpretation of the Dempster-Shafer background: We assume that this decision is \"roughly evaluated,\" while we assume that the assumption of the rough set theory is not crude.

It usually happens that these attributes are only able to make a lower and upper approximation of the value of the decision attribute (that is, the set of vectors that only support this value of the decision variable, and the set of explanatory attributes that also support this value of the decision variable.

Hummel and Landy [13] give an even more curious account of expert independence: it is a (completely ignorant) \"committee\" that combines expert opinions that are, it is assumed, independent. We think that what really lies behind these clumsy concepts of expert opinion independence has been stated correctly and explicitly, the probability of the proof approach [22, 23].
