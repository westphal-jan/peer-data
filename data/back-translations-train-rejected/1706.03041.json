The structural similarities between these two concepts are reviewed and combined to a \"wavenet\", allowing for the direct learning of optimal wavelet filter coefficient through stochastic gradient descent with back-propagation over ensembles of training inputs, where conditions on the filter coefficients for constituting orthonormal wavelet bases are cast as quadratic regularisations terms. We describe the practical implementation of this method, and study its performance for high-energy physics collision events for QCD $2 \\to 2$ processes.

Neural network", "text": "Since (artificial) neural networks have become ubiquitous in most areas of the physical sciences, we will only briefly review the central concepts, since they relate to the rest of this discussion. A comprehensive introduction can be found, for example, in Ref. [21]. Neural networks can be regarded as general mappings f: Rn \u2192 Rm, which can approximate any function, provided sufficient capacity is available. In the simplest case, such networks are constructed sequentially, where the input vector f = h0 \"RN0\" is transformed by the inner product with a weight matrix-1, the output of which is a hidden layer h1 \"RN1,\" and so on, until the output layer \"RNl\" is reached. The configuration of a given neural network, in terms of the number of layers and their respective size, is called network architecture. In addition to the transfer matrices \"i,\" the layers can be equipped with bias nodes, which do not provide an opportunity for activation as well as J."}, {"heading": "C. Combining concepts", "text": "The decisive step is then to recognize the deep parallels between these two constructs. We can gradually consider the discrete wavenets as RN \u2192 RN neural networks with a fully connected, non-sequential, dyadic architecture without bias units and with linear (i.e., no) activations. A schematic representation of this setup, referred to here as \"Wavenet,\" is shown in Figure 1c. This is done by identifying the neural network transfer matrices with the low- and high-pass filter operators in the matrix formulation of the waveform referred to as \"Wavenet.\" The forward waveform then corresponds to neural network mapping, and the output vector of the neural network is precisely the waveband coefficients of input in relation to the base that {a}.If we can formulate an objective way of functioning coefficients, i.e."}, {"heading": "IV. MEASURING OPTIMALITY", "text": "The choice of objective function defines the sense in which the basis learned by the method outlined in Section III C. This also gives the user a certain degree of freedom in defining the measure of optimality, the only condition being that the objective function is differentiable in terms of wavelength coefficients.4 From the point of view of compression, sparseness is clearly a useful measurement, as it measures the amount of information that can be stored with a certain amount of space / memory. From the point of view of representation, sparseness is probably also a significant goal, since a basis that efficiently represents the defining characteristics of a (class of) signal c also represents the signal (s) zero (s) as a coefficient."}, {"heading": "V. LEARNING PROCEDURE", "text": "As mentioned above, the full objective function for the optimization problem is given as the sum of a sparsity term S ({c}) and a regularization term R ({a}), the relative contribution of the latter being controlled by the regularization constant \u03bb, i.e. J ({c}, {a}) = S ({c}) + \u03bbR ({a}) (9), where {c} is the set of wave coefficients for a given training example and {a} is the current set of filter coefficients. The R-term ensures that the configuration of the filter coefficient {a} actually corresponds to a wave base as described above (C1-5); the S-term measures the quality of a given wave base according to the chosen fitness measure. The learning task then consists in optimizing the filter coefficients according to this combined objective function, i.e. determining a filter coefficient in a zero-dimensional filter space."}, {"heading": "A.

EXAMPLE: QCD 2\u2192 2 PROCESSES IN HIGH-ENERGY PHYSICS", "text": "As an example of the method for learning optimal wavelength behavior, in this case, the optimal wavelength behavior shown in section IV is only possible in sections V and VI. (There are only two processes generated in Pythia8 [27, 28], divided into a 2D array of size 64 x 64 at the respective plane, roughly equivalent to the angular granularity of current general radiation.) The collision events are generated at a center of mass energy of s = 13 TeV with a generator level of 280 GeV imposed at the conductive level of the partner. QCD radiation patterns are regulated by scale-dependent splitting kernel, which could make them suitable candidates for wavelength representation, as these naturally exhibit similar, scale-dependent behavior."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The author thanks Troels C.

The structural similarities between these two concepts are reviewed and combined to a \u201cwavenet\u201d, allowing for the direct learning of optimal wavelet filter coefficient through stochastic gradient descent with back-propagation over ensembles of training inputs, where conditions on the filter coefficients for constituting orthonormal wavelet bases are cast as quadratic regularisations terms. We describe the practical implementation of this method [1], and study its performance for high-energy physics collision events for QCD 2 \u2192 2 processes. It is shown that an optimal solution is found, even in a high-dimensional search space, and the implications of the result are discussed.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
