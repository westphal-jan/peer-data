The nature of the design phase depends on the game mode. In this essay, we will primarily discuss the Captain's Mode, a game mode used in the professional game but less popular with casual gamers. In the Captain's Mode, each player nominates a captain who selects heroes for his team. The two captains go through a fixed order of hero selection (which they add to their team) and prohibit heroes (which prevents both teams from selecting them).A hero can only be selected once. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of Xiv: 170 6.03 122v 1 [cs.A I] 9 Jun 201 7a professional game design phase. The design is complex enough to guarantee its own paper. In fact, professional players often pop up with team drafts full of opposing ideas on their own \"bidding\" pages."}, {"heading": "Gameplay - Match", "text": "The primary goal in a game of DOTA 2 is to destroy the antiquity of the opposing team, a structure that is protected in the center of the base of each team. Figure 2 shows an annotated superpile drawing of the entire DOTA 2 chart1 with the antiquians, which are depicted as circles in opposite corners. Connecting the two bases are three paths that are called alleys, two around the edges of the map and one through the center. Regularly, NPC creatures, which are called crawlers, spawn from both bases and travel along these alleys and attack each other as they compete. Towers are also placed along these alleys, which is indicated by squares in Figure 2. Towers are strong structures that spawn at -1This map comes from an earlier version of the game, but is used here as key details that always stay the same. Nearby enemy units provide visions for their team and help define the boundaries of a team's territory. Towers are invulnerable to damage if they are not the outer tower and the oldest tower is invincible."}, {"heading": "Professional Play", "text": "In 2011, Valve announced DOTA 2 by organizing a global tournament called The International, in which sixteen professional DOTA 1 teams were invited to compete for a share of $1.6 million, the largest prize pool in eSports at the time. In 2015, the fifth incarnation of International had a prize pool exceeding $18 million. Meanwhile, the professional scene has become both a destination for young players and a big business for sponsors and organizers. Most of the top teams are run by independent organizations, have multiple sponsors and employ managers, coaches, dedicated analysts, PR and various other staff. Most DOTA 2 tournaments, from the smallest amateur regions to the most high-profile multimillion-viewer events, are broadcast online for free, with broadcasters providing commentary, analysis and statistics on the games, which is common in most eSports, including Heartstone, Starcraft 2, and other MOBAs such as League of Legends. A common structure for an eSports broadcast has two distinct sets of people: one commenting on the events, one listening to the other, one listening to the stats, and one listening to the commentators while the other."}, {"heading": "Challenges", "text": "In this section, we will describe challenges beyond AI character control, which we believe will become important and fruitful areas of research in the coming years.

Today, major tournaments and studios hire dedicated observers whose only job is to control the camera and focus on the most relevant action. Camera control is much tougher than traditional sports, as it often lacks a single focus (such as a ball). Deciding what to show and how to show it is a difficult task. Tools that can help to help high-end broadcasters, but also give amateur broadcasters and casual viewers a chance to focus on the game itself."}, {"heading": "Vision", "text": "An observation station is a cheap but limited number of objects that can be placed on the map to allow viewing in a 360-degree circle, obscured by certain map features such as trees or cliffs. Observation stations are invisible, but can be detected and destroyed by certain objects. If they are not destroyed, they expire by themselves after seven minutes. As the number of observation stations is limited, but destructible, there is a tension between the placement of stations in good places without becoming predictable. Professional teams often examine how certain players place the stations to predict their behavior in future games. This is an example of a tightly defined system within DOTA 2 that is ripe for analysis and optimization. Publicly available replay data for each DOTA 2 game, including professional games, includes data on hero movement and station placement, allowing a complete model to be created for which players were visible at what times and which stations are typically placed in an early game mapping of a game map3."}, {"heading": "Patch Changes", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never been as far as this year."}, {"heading": "Inventing Techniques & Discovering Exploits", "text": "Many of the key mechanical systems now integrated into DOTA 2 and many other MOBAs have emerged as bugs, exploits, or emerging behaviors found by players in the game. Thus, in DOTA 2, players earn gold by striking the deathblow against a non-hero creature. An inadvertent feature of DOTA's original implementation in Warcraft 3 allowed players to attack their own reptiles to kill them. Players used this feature to invent the term \"denial,\" since attacks on their own creatures prevent their opponents from gaining gold (they themselves did not receive any gold from it), which is now a fundamental part of the resource race in DOTA 2 and is recognized in the game through statistical tracking and its inclusion in tutorials. Such discoveries continue to happen today as patches introduce new items, skills, systems, and interactions. Discovering new mechanics has advantages for many groups: they give players and teams a temporary advantage, allowing developers to make real exploits, and interesting systems."}, {"heading": "Abuse", "text": "Many MOBAs are designed to be highly competitive environments that emphasize players \"skills, their improvement, and ultimately their mastery, and the configuration of these games as a sport is compounded by the close links with the professional scene, where the most popular players are presented as role models, and by a relentless stream of statistics and records that track players\" performance and ranking among their peers. This atmosphere, combined with the high barrier to entry and the intimidating learning curve of DOTA 2, makes the community a cooker of negative emotions. Player abuse is a major problem in MOBAs. The only attempt to curb this behavior is a reporting system that relies on the player base to inform Valve when a player acts improperly. However, this system is more commonly used to report players who are perceived as bad, even a form of abuse. Riot Games, developers of the BA League of Legends, will have automatic ways to address learning problems, such as machine-assisted abuse in areas."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "DOTA 2 is basically a game about team collaboration, cohesion and communication, and this adds a much less studied, more complex dimension to AI problems.
