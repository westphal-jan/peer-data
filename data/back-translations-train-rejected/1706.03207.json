The closest to our approach is the type 1 extension of the ALC proposed in the appendix of [11]. In short, [11] introduces probabilistic constraints of the form P (C | D) \u2264 p, P (C | D) = p, P (C | D) \u2265 p for ALC concepts C, D. These correspond to the conditionals (C | D) [0, p], (C | D), (C | D) [p, 1]. Conversely, any condition can be rewritten as such a probabilistic constraint. However, there is a subtle but fundamental difference in semantics that is not contained in domain X."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "As a first step towards effective thinking in statistical ALC, we focused on EL, a well-known sublogic of ALC that allows polynomial time thinking in its classical form. We showed that upper limits with conditional constraints make the satisfaction problem in statistical EL NP-hard and gave a NEXPTIME algorithm for deciding on satisfaction. We showed that traceability can be restored by placing strict upper limits in the conditional statements.We will provide more algorithms and a more complete picture of the complexity of the argument for statistical ALC and its fragments in future work. A combination of holistic programming and the principle of inclusion exclusion can be fruitful to design initial algorithms for complete statistical ALC logic."}], "references": [{"title": "Pushing the EL envelope", "author": ["F.
