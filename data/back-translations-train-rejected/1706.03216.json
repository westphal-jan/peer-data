Introduction", "text": "A principal method of predicting how we make these decisions is the application of the Hyperand Hypospeech Theory (H & H): This theory predicts that loudspeakers continuously approximate how strongly the speech signal needs to be adjusted to match the recipient's ability to decipher it, and that loudspeakers adapt their speech signal accordingly, along a continuum of hyper- and hyperpeech [1]. One particular type of recipient is the pre-linguistic child, which has a lower ability to decipher the speech signal than older children and adults. One way to measure the degree of such adaptation within an utterance is the articulation rate (AR). In this longitudinal corpus-based study, we investigate whether adults increase their AR in Swedish child-controlled language (CDS) depending on the linguistic capacity of the child, which is approximately the age of children aged 0-7-9, for controlling 2 factors."}, {"heading": "2. Related work", "text": "It has long been recognized that CDS has several different characteristics compared to adults (ADHD), such as fewer words per utterance [2] and lower speech rate [3]. Furthermore, it was shown that this work is lower than in CDS, but the number of language units per unit of time, including the number of breaks, was carried out while the author was visiting the Department of Linguistics. Language rate is the number of language units per unit of time, including breaks (7, 8)."}, {"heading": "2.1. Research Questions", "text": "We ask three questions: 1) Is there a correlation between the rate of articulation and the length of the enunciation on the one hand and the length of the enunciation and surprises on the other? 2) Is the rate of articulation in adult speech higher than in child-friendly speech when it comes to controlling the length of the enunciation, the differences in the rate of articulation between speakers and surprises? 3) Does the increase in the rate of articulation in the speech Xiv: 170 6.03 216v 1 [cs.C L] of 10 June 2017 apply as a function of the age of the child depicted in [12], even when it comes to surprises?"}, {"heading": "3. Method and Data", "text": "To answer these questions, we needed Swedish data on AR in ADS or CDS and a model of how surprises are presented in the speaker handset. We built two different models that were trained and tested. Therefore, the data fed into the language models in this study consists of five different sets, three of which form the training set for the models (see Section 3.2), the other two form the test sets (see Section 3.3), which are both parts of two different corpora. One, in the future the CDS test set, comes from the MINGLE corpus [17], the other is half of Spontal [18], in the future the ADS test set."}, {"heading": "3.1. Corpora", "text": "The MINGLE corpus is a multimodal corpus that was commented on by recordings from Stockholm's Babylab, which is part of the Phonetics Laboratory at Stockholm University. Recordings consist of parent-child dyads in which the subjects were equipped with wireless microphones that allowed them to move freely. Sessions between parents and children consisted of a task, such as creating a puzzle, and of free play. Sessions lasted about half an hour [17, 19]. Spontaneous is a corpus consisting of transcribed personal dialogues between two speakers at a time when the maximum length of a silence within an utterance is 200 ms [18, 20]. Overreactions from 12 of the 24 of these dialogues were used in the ADD test. Overreactions with laughter and coughing were excluded."}, {"heading": "3.2. Language model training data", "text": "We train the language models on three sets of data: half of a subset of spontaneous (the other subset on which we test), a subset of material similar to the MINGLE corpus, and the first 1,400,000 lines of SBS [21] (see Table 1)."}, {"heading": "3.3. Language model test data", "text": "Transcribed expressions from the MINGLE corpus of 7 parents, 4 mothers and 3 fathers (i.e. 4 children) were modified over a total of 28 sessions into a form more faithful to spoken Swedish (e.g., in relevant cases, the \"na-gonting\" (something) was changed to \"na-t\"), statements were shortened, prolonged or divided so as not to contain pauses longer than 200 ms. Utterances containing laughter, onomatopoeic sounds, singing and whispering were omitted, and only statements from the time when the parent and the child were alone in the room were recorded to avoid the parent communicating with the experimental leader while the child was in the room. The number of syllables for both groups of experiments was approximated as the number of transcribed vowels in each utterance, giving a very good approximation in Swedish, since in principle each orthographic vowel corresponds to one redefined vocal for each of the 8,000 seconds of the total number of the articulated words transcribed for each utterance."}, {"heading": "3.4. Language Modeling", "text": "We applied a neural speech model at the sign level. The model uses a revolutionary neural network (CNN) and a highway network of signs, the output of which is transferred to a recursive speech model for neural networks (LSTM). [22] The model takes a sequence of signs as input and gives the probability of that sequence.1 One reason for choosing a sign model is that words that are not visible in the training material can still be well modeled. For example, if the model has seen words like fast, sick, and fast, it would be able to assign a well-estimated probability to the invisible word disease. For comparison, we also applied a language model that uses trigram statistics at the word level with Kneser-Ney smoothing [23], using the formulation of [24]."}, {"heading": "4. Results and Discussion", "text": "All analyses in this section have been carried out twice, with the surprising estimates of both the Neural Character-Based Language Model and the Kneser-Ney N-gram Language Model. Due to space constraints, we report only on analyses with the former. Unless explicitly stated, analyses with the latter do not differ qualitatively from the former. Since most of the training data of the language models consisted of written blog data or adult speech, there is reason to believe that the models provide more accurate estimates of the surprises for the ADS Test Set than for the CDS Test Set. If the relationship between AR in the CDS and our estimates of the surprises of the relationship between AR in the ADS and surprises is similar, however, we can be more confident that the surprise estimates also apply to the CDS Test Set. Therefore, we first present an analysis of the ADS Test Set, then we come to the analysis of the CDS Test Set, and finally we look at the difference between ADS and CDS."}, {"heading": "4.1. ADS test set", "text": "Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the sexes and the sexes in terms of log syllables (Panel A), on the one hand, and on the other. Figure 1 indicates that the total number of genders is higher than that of women, but on the other hand, it is lower than that of men. You can therefore exclude that the sexes are women."}, {"heading": "4.2. CDS test set", "text": "Figure 2 shows the relationship between AR and childhood in months (Panel A), AR and enunciation length in terms of log syllables (Panel B), and finally AR and surprisal corrected for enunciation length (Panel C) in the CDS testset.Panel A and B show that, as in [12], there is a slight increase in AR in CDS as the child gets older, and that, as in ADS, AR is higher for longer enunciations. Panel C shows that even in CDS, AR is lower for enunciations that are less expected in terms of surprises. To determine whether the relationship between childhood and AR in CDS still holds, though surprisingly the CDS test set has been analyzed with mixed modelling effects. This model predicts AR in CDS as a function of enunciation length, again in terms of SurAL, SURLANS."}, {"heading": "4.3. Articulation rate in CDS in comparison to ADS", "text": "Finally, we investigate whether AR in CDS is lower than in ADS. As shown in the previous sections, AR in both ADS and CDS is strongly influenced by the length of the utterance on the one hand and surprisingly on the other. To make a comparison between AR in CDS and ADS, these factors need to be controlled. Therefore, using a combination of the CDS test set and the ADS test set, we have built in a model that predicts AR on the basis of the language type (CDS vs. ADS), with the length of the utterance in standardized log syllables STDLOGSYLLABLES, SURPRISAL, and the STDLOGSYLLABLES: SURPRISE TRANSLATION interaction. Topics also included random speaker sections and random slopes for STDLOGSYLLABLES, TRANSLATION, and their interaction."}, {"heading": "4.4. Drawbacks and Future Work", "text": "One limitation of the language models is that they only model subsequent probabilities based on linear preceding linguistic outcomes without taking into account syntactic structures or pragmatic constraints. Although we have assumed that the function that AR maps to age is linear, this is not necessarily the case. There may well be local increases and decreases in AR over time. Future work would benefit from taking into account data from what the child produces or metadata about his or her linguistic capacity, as there is, of course, no one-to-one mapping between age and linguistic capacity."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "We have shown that in adult-directed speech, there is a positive correlation between articulation rate and length of expression (in terms of number of language units) and a negative correlation between length of expression and surprise length, and we have shown that the rate of articulation in adult-directed speech is higher than in child-directed speech when controlling length of expression, differences in articulation rate between speakers and surprises, and that this is the first study to show that the rate of articulation increases depending on the age of the child when the above factors are taken into account. These results support H & H theory as they suggest that speakers adjust their speech signal to match the recipient's approximate ability to decipher message."}, {"heading": "6.
