In the end, the auction yielded $19.8 billion, $10.05 billion of which was paid to 175 broadcasters for voluntarily relinquishing their licenses across 14 UHF channels. Stations that continued broadcasting were assigned potentially new channels to fit as densely as possible into the channels that remained. The government netted more than $7 billion (used to pay down the national debt) after covering costs. A crucial element of the auction design was the construction of a solver, dubbed SATFC, that determined whether sets of stations could be \"repacked\" in this way; it needed to run every time a station was given a price quote. This paper describes the process by which we built SATFC. We adopted an approach we dub \"deep optimization\", taking a data-driven, highly parametric, and computationally intensive approach to solver design. More specifically, to build SATFC we designed software that could pair both complete and local-search SAT-encoded feasibility checking with a wide range of domain-specific techniques. We then used automatic algorithm configuration techniques to construct a portfolio of eight complementary algorithms to be run in parallel, aiming to achieve good performance on instances that arose in proprietary auction simulations. To evaluate the impact of our solver in this paper, we built an open-source reverse auction simulator. We found that within the short time budget required in practice, SATFC solved more than 95% of the problems it encountered. Furthermore, the incentive auction paired with SATFC produced nearly optimal allocations in a restricted setting and substantially outperformed other alternatives at national scale.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Jun 2017 03:15:20 GMT  (6892kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03304v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["neil newman", "alexandre fr\\'echette", "kevin leyton-brown"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03304"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.03304.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Deep Optimization for Spectrum Repacking", "authors": ["Neil Newman", "Alexandre Fr\u00e9chette", "Kevin Leyton-Brown"], "emails": ["newmanne@cs.ubc.ca", "afrechet@cs.ubc.ca", "kevinlb@cs.ubc.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

We now describe how we searched this room to build a custom solution. Identifying a set of parameters that optimize the performance of a given algorithm on a given dataset is known as algorithm configuration. There are a variety of algorithm configuration tools [16, 26, 15, 2]. We used the sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC) [15], the publicly available method that arguably achieves the best performance (see, for example, [17]). SMAC uses the \"Bajesian optimization\" approach by making random sampling operations and exploring algorithm designs based on an acquired model appear promising. Unfortunately, even after performing algorithm configuration, it is rare to find a single algorithm that matches all other instances of a complete SAT problem."}, {"heading": "4.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We developed a tailor-made solution to this problem using an approach we call deep optimization. Specifically, we used a large parameterized design space to construct a strong portfolio of heuristic algorithms: SATFC 2.3.1, an open source solver used in the real auction. To evaluate it for this work, we conducted experiments with a new reverse auction simulator. We found that replacing SATFC with a standard feasibility checker resulted in both efficiency losses and cost increases, so it seems likely that our efforts resulted in significant economic benefits for broadcasters, the US government, and the American public."}, {"heading": "8.

In the end, the auction yielded $19.8 billion, $10.05 billion of which was paid to 175 broadcasters for voluntarily relinquishing their licenses across 14 UHF channels. Stations that continued broadcasting were assigned potentially new channels to fit as densely as possible into the channels that remained. The government netted more than $7 billion (used to pay down the national debt) after covering costs. A crucial element of the auction design was the construction of a solver, dubbed SATFC, that determined whether sets of stations could be \u201crepacked\u201d in this way; it needed to run every time a station was given a price quote. This paper describes the process by which we built SATFC. We adopted an approach we dub \u201cdeep optimization\u201d, taking a data-driven, highly parametric, and computationally intensive approach to solver design. More specifically, to build SATFC we designed software that could pair both complete and local-search SAT-encoded feasibility checking with a wide range of domain-specific techniques, such as constraint graph decomposition and novel caching mechanisms that allow for reuse of partial solutions from related, solved problems. We then used automatic algorithm configuration techniques to construct a portfolio of eight complementary algorithms to be run in parallel, aiming to achieve good performance on instances that arose in proprietary auction simulations. To evaluate the impact of our solver in this paper, we built an open-source reverse auction simulator. We found that within the short time budget required in practice, SATFC solved more than 95% of the problems it encountered. Furthermore, the incentive auction paired with SATFC produced nearly optimal allocations in a restricted setting and substantially outperformed other alternatives at national scale.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
