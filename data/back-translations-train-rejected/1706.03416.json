Topological map is commonly used for representing large scale, global maps such as floor plans. Although much work has been done in topological map extraction, we have found little previous work on the problem of learning the topological map using a probabilistic model. Learning a topological map means learning the structure of the large-scale space and dependency between places, for example, how the evidence of a group of places influence the attributes of other places. This is an important step towards planning complex actions in the environment. In this thesis, we consider the problem of using probabilistic deep learning model to learn the topological map, which is essentially a sparse undirected graph where nodes represent places annotated with their semantic attributes (e.g. place category). We propose to use a novel probabilistic deep model, Sum-Product Networks (SPNs), due to their unique properties. We present two methods for learning topological maps using SPNs: the place grid method and the template-based method. We contribute an algorithm that builds SPNs for graphs using template models. Our experiments evaluate the ability of our models to enable robots to infer semantic attributes and detect maps with novel semantic attribute arrangements. Our results demonstrate their understanding of the topological map structure and spatial relations between places.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Jun 2017 21:52:56 GMT  (1554kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03416v1", "26 pages, 14 figures, senior thesis for departmental honors at the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington"], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Jul 2017 06:16:23 GMT  (1611kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03416v2", "26 pages, 14 figures, senior thesis for departmental honors at the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington"]], "COMMENTS": "26 pages, 14 figures, senior thesis for departmental honors at the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["kaiyu zheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03416"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.03416.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Large-Scale Topological Maps Using Sum-Product Networks", "authors": ["Kaiyu Zheng"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Table of contents"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction 1", "text": "1.1 Restrictions.................................................................................................................."}, {"heading": "2 Related Works 3", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3 Background 4", "text": "3.1 Sum product networks..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."}, {"heading": "4 Problem Statement & Proposed Solutions 9", "text": "4.1 Problem description..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments 16", "text": "5.1.

If this is not the case, the instances are divided into similar subsets and the sum node is added over the subsets. This algorithm requires a large amount of training data to achieve good partition results. This is not very practical in our problem because there is very little data for the topological maps and it is difficult to obtain an enormous amount of such data. 6Random decomposition We use a different approach to learning the SPN structure, similar to that in [21].

In the context of robotics, the nodes in this graph are the places accessible by the robot, and edges indicate the affordability of navigation between locations, i.e. the feasibility of navigating from one place to another. Figure 1 shows examples of simplified topological maps. As already discussed, the topological map is used as a layer to capture the geometry of the map and the connectivity between locations in the DASH. The authors of DASH [22] also describe a mapping algorithm that builds a topological map. As the robot explores an environment, the mapping algorithm expands the topological map by adding placeholders [23] as nodes, according to a probability formulation as consequence properties P (E | G) = 1 Z-i-shaped models of egg-shaped places (egg)."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Challenges", "text": "There are several challenges in modeling topological maps due to their scale and variability; a complete map of a workspace can contain dozens of nodes and hundreds of edges; the number of locations in one map is likely to differ from that in another; different topological maps can represent environments of different dimensions; the structure of locations in one map can appear very different from another; and finally, because our topological maps can encode the geometric structure described above, different topological maps can also be rotated differently for similar environments, as the underlying metric maps created by SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) can be rotated differently as a whole."}, {"heading": "4 Problem Statement & Proposed Solutions", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Problem Statement", "text": "Our problem is this: In view of datasets of topological maps with an unknown number of nodes per map, we would like to construct sum product networks so that the resulting model is able to demonstrate its understanding of the spatial relationships of categories. It can demonstrate this capability in several ways. For example, if we provide a topological map instance with missing semantic information, the model should reasonably predict what the missing information is. Moreover, if we provide a topological map instance with strange category arrangements (e.g. corridor nodes called bureau), the model should be able to detect this novelty. In Section 5, we describe experiments that are being conducted to test this capability."}, {"heading": "4.2 Place Grid Method", "text": "To meet the challenge of topological maps being of different sizes and shapes, we present a simple idea, which consists in mapping them on fixed-size grids. A grid can be considered a generic representation of topological maps. It approaches the topological map, but preserves most of the neighborhood relationships between places. It is easy to use SPN to model this grid. Using the algorithm in 3.1.4, we can create an SPN for the grid, which then indirectly models topological maps as a whole. 9"}, {"heading": "4.2.1 From Topological Map to Place Grid", "text": "In this section we first define a place in a topological map, then define a place grid, and then describe in detail how a topological map can be converted to a place grid. Our definition of a place is derived from the representation of the polar occupation grid for the local environment, which is described by Pronobis and Rao in [21]. Definition 4.1 (Place): A place p in a topological map is three times (L, V, a), where L is the position of p in relation to the coordinate system of the topological map, V is the number of views in the polar occupation grid, and a is the designation of a place category.An example of a polar occupation grid of a place is shown in Figure 3.Definition 4.2 (place grid).A place grid G with resolution r (meters per cell) is a m \u00d7 n matrix matrix in which each cell contains a place.In view of a 2D placement grid of a place grid of a place we can show 4.2 (place grid of a placementre). A place grid G with resolution r (meters per cell) is a m x matrix with resolution Mp."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Modeling a Place Grid Using Rotation-Invariant SPN", "text": "There are several ways to deal with the rotation of topological maps. We could rotate all topological maps before hand, based on the previous knowledge that human environments typically have rectangular corners and straight walls. Another possibility is to include rotational invariance in the SPN that models the space grid. At this point, we will present the theory of constructing a rotationally invariant SPN based on a space grid. Rotationally invariant SPN will consider k number of important directions (e.g. 8). At the top level of the SPN, we will add a maximum node with k children of sum nodes, where each sum node models the space grid for a particular orientation. Suppose that a child A is a grid created by rotating another child B around angle constant. Then, a cell (xB, yB) in B corresponds to (has the same value as) a cell (xA, yB is compatible with the following cell (xB) to xB (xB)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Template-Based Method", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Motivation", "text": "One shortcoming of the space grid method is its dependence on a predefined size and resolution of the grid; choosing the right dimensions and resolution is a difficult task, and usually the parameters chosen cannot be generalized well for other invisible topological map examples. Moreover, the grid itself is in the middle between accuracy and approximation: although the grid is metric, the cells do not accurately represent the location of the locations, which can affect the quality of the conclusions. To some extent, it is unnecessary to have an accurate absolute representation of the topological map, since (1) it is difficult to maintain this accuracy given the variability of topological maps, and (2) topological maps are usually used in conjunction with metric maps for robotic planning and navigation, which serve as a reference for high-level planning. Therefore, we propose a template-based relative representation of the topological map that models a certain basic structure of a chart and extends it as needed."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Building Instance-Specific SPN for Graphs from Templates", "text": "Consider a basic graph structure B, such as the three-node structure in Figure 6. The only limitation that this structure has is the connectivity of places. Examples of such a basic structure are in Figure 5. One reason is that a simple structure probably occurs very frequently in the topological map. Another reason is that determining whether one graph is a subgraph of another (subgraph isomorphism problem) is NP-complete. Linear time resolution exists, but only works for planar graphs [7], and a topological map is not necessarily planar. Algorithm 1 is a greedy algorithm to partition the graph if B is very simple. In this algorithm, the graph is assumed to be a function specific to B; it could be hard coded."}, {"heading": "14 end", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "15 end", "text": "16 Vavailable = Vavailable \u2212 {v}; 17 end 18 return (VH, EH) Now that we have a basic structure as our template, we can consider constructing a hierarchy of templates. Consider another simple graph structure S, which consists of B. For example, S is connected to a pair of B, as shown in the red region of the topological map in Figure 6. We can re-partition graph H through S with the same algorithm. Therefore, the given graph instance can be divided into a graph with nodes representing S. We can think of B as the template, and P (S) as the common distribution of the templates defined in S. The probability P (S) is the expansion model of the template, which dictates how a template forms a graph that represents S."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Data Collection", "text": "To support the larger goal of our research, to learn the Deep Affordance Spatial Hierarchy (DASH), we collected a large dataset of fully commented sensory (RGB, laser rangefinder measurements, odometry), local and virtual scans, a low representation of the environment immediately in front of the robot. For this work, we used this dataset to generate topological maps with nodes labeled by place category.The dataset consists of 100 sequences and a total of 11 different floor plans in three buildings at three different locations: Stockholm, Sweden, Freiburg, Germany and Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany. The summary of the sequences is in Table 1. For each sequence among the data types included, there is a corresponding canonical map and an annotated floor plan on which the annotated localized poses are generated using adaptive Monte Carlo Localibration (AMCL) with a frequency of 30 Hz. We use the canonical map and the stock topographic maps, where we use the larger, topographical spaces."}, {"heading": "5.2 Methodology", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Software", "text": "We used LibSPN [21], a Python library that implements learning and deduction with SPNs on GPUs.

We use this functionality to generate SPN both on a placeholder and on templates."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Experiments for Place Grid Method", "text": "We converted topological maps from Stockholm into space grids. We used space grids of the size of 15 rows by 10 columns with a resolution of 1.5 m per cell. The resolution is lower than the 1.0 m of the desired space separation in topological maps to ensure the connectivity of the places when they are placed in the network, as suggested in Section 4.2.1. Since the size of our data set is not very large, we have reduced the number of space categories to four: entrance, corridor, small office and large office. so that we can better evaluate the learning of structure and dependence. Note that for other categories, such as kitchen and meeting room, we do not distinguish them from the unknown space category. To check the consistency of the space network method, we used cross-validation by forming the network on three floors and testing them on the other, for each combination of the four floors in the Stockholm data set."}, {"heading": "5.2.3 Experiments for Template-Based Method", "text": "As described in Section 4.3, during the training we train an SPN for a single template or hierarchy of templates. Therefore, we have created a dataset in which each example is an assignment of the template variables. The dataset is created from both Stockholm sequences and Freiburg sequences, because the topological relationships of the place categories are generally the same in different environments. [1] We do this by partitioning the available topological maps using the templates. Partitioning operation is performed ten times for each topological map to capture different combinations of nodes. During the test, we construct a complete SPN for each test instance according to the algorithm described in Section 4.3.2. Similar to the experiments for the placeholder method, we also include parts of the topological map and ask the model to derive its attributes. As the templates only take into account the connectivity of locations and the location category is the only semantic attribute we exercise on the basis that we expect the template to be based on multiple templates, but only the template for the current behavior we expect the template to be based on several SPN, as the current one."}, {"heading": "5.3 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.3.1 Place Grid Method", "text": "The results are shown in Figure 11. The images on the left are the results of training samples, and those on the right are the results of validation samples. The first three lines show the results of map completion in place with different closed regions. The last line shows the results of map completion in place with randomly locked cells. These results suggest that the model learns the relationships between space categories and general map structure to some degree. It is able to place door nodes between corridor and rooms. It is also able to learn that corridors stretch along the same line and not mix up different room categories."}, {"heading": "5.3.2 Template-Based Method", "text": "We performed the experiment to complete the missing value on three sequences.7 Figure 14 shows the result of one of the sequences in which we skipped places with an unknown category and used a hierarchy of templates. We found that typically a template hierarchy yields better results than using only a single template. The constructed full SPN can derive space classes based on the surrounding information, but the performance is not very stable.It can be concluded that there is a door structure between two places of different classes and that the rooms are overcrowded Nodes6Note that in the case on the right, since we do not distinguish between certain space categories (such as the kitchen) and the unknown, these skipped categories have the same designation as the Unknown. Therefore, the model is of the view that it is appropriate not to place a door opening cell between an unknown (background) cell and a corridor cell, as this background cell refers to a category that we may have limited due to the amount of time."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we have motivated the importance of learning spatial representation for autonomous mobile robotics. We have described the role of the topological map and discussed its generation in the context of the Deep Affordance Spatial Hierarchy. Subsequently, we have presented two methods that can enable learning of topological maps using summary product networks. Finally, we have described experiments and presented results demonstrating the effect of learning for each method. Indeed, there is work to improve each of the two methods. In particular, in the template-based method, the current method only takes into account the networking of places and place categories as the only semantic attribute. We want to introduce more complexity into the templates and consider more information (such as laser range measurements) when learning the SPN templates. 21"}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgements", "text": "I am sincerely grateful for the advice and encouragement of my consultant, Dr. Andrzej Pronobis, and for the insightful conversations I had with him and my laboratory partner, Kousuke Ariga.

knowledge. Topological map is commonly used for representing large scale, global maps such as floor plans. Although much work has been done in topological map extraction, we have found little previous work on the problem of learning the topological map using a probabilistic model. Learning a topological map means learning the structure of the large-scale space and dependency between places, for example, how the evidence of a group of places influence the attributes of other places. This is an important step towards planning complex actions in the environment. In this thesis, we consider the problem of using probabilistic deep learning model to learn the topological map, which is essentially a sparse undirected graph where nodes represent places annotated with their semantic attributes (e.g. place category). We propose to use a novel probabilistic deep model, Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) [20], due to their unique properties. We present two methods for learning topological maps using SPNs: the place grid method and the template-based method. We contribute an algorithm that builds SPNs for graphs using template models. Our experiments evaluate the ability of our models to enable robots to infer semantic attributes and detect maps with novel semantic attribute arrangements. Our results demonstrate their understanding of the topological map structure and spatial relations between places.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
