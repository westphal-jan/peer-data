In this paper, we study the interaction of power, gender, and dialog behavior in organizational interactions. In order to perform this study, we first construct the Gender Identified Enron Corpus of emails, in which we semi-automatically assign the gender of around 23,000 individuals who authored around 97,000 email messages in the Enron corpus. This corpus, which is made freely available, is orders of magnitude larger than previously existing gender identified corpora in the email domain. Next, we use this corpus to perform a large-scale data-oriented study of the interplay of gender and manifestations of power. We argue that, in addition to one's own gender, the \"gender environment\" of an interaction, i.e., the gender makeup of one's interlocutors, also affects the way power is manifested in dialog. We focus especially on manifestations of power in the dialog structure --- both, in a shallow sense that disregards the textual content of messages (e.g., how often do the participants contribute, how often do they get replies etc.), as well as the structure that is expressed within the textual content (e.g., who issues requests and how are they made, whose requests get responses etc.). We find that both gender and gender environment affect the ways power is manifested in dialog, resulting in patterns that reveal the underlying factors. Finally, we show the utility of gender information in the problem of automatically predicting the direction of power between pairs of participants in email interactions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 02:24:33 GMT  (4101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03441v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vinodkumar prabhakaran", "owen rambow"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03441"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.03441.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Vinodkumar Prabhakaran", "Owen Rambow"], "emails": ["VINOD@CS.STANFORD.EDU", "RAMBOW@CCLS.COLUMBIA.EDU"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this paper, we examine the interaction of power, gender, and dialogue behavior in organizational interactions.

Introduction", "text": "This is not the first time we have found ourselves in a situation of crisis."}, {"heading": "2. Literature Review", "text": "In sociolinguistics, there is much work on how gender and language usage relate (Tannen, 1991, 1993; Holmes, 1995; Kendall and Tannen, 1997; Coates, 1998; Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2003; Holmes and Stubbe, 2003; Mills, 2003; Kendall, 2003; Herring, 2008), some of which deal specifically with language usage in the work environment and / or in relation to power relations, while others examine gender differences in language usage in general. Understanding these different strands of research is important for a computer linguist working in this area. In this section, we will summarize this literature and focus more on the studies that have influenced the work presented in this paper."}, {"heading": "2.1 Gendered Differences in Language Use", "text": "Many studies have shown that men and women are able to identify themselves, some researchers attribute this to psychological differences (Gilligan, 1.), while others point to social benefits and power structures within society (Zimmerman and West, 1987), arguing that in the majority of cases women are unable to identify themselves."}, {"heading": "2.2 Gender and Power in Work Place", "text": "In the study of gender and language usage, there is a considerable amount of work specifically related to language usage in the work environment (West, 1990; Tannen, 1994; Kendall and Tannen, 1997; Kendall, 2003). In general, these studies found that women use more polite language and are less likely to adopt linguistic strategies that would make their authority more visible (Kendall, 2003). Similarly, West (1990) found that male physicians differ in the way they give instructions to their patients. Malephysicians toughened their instructions, while female physicians used forms that mitigated them. In the study of gender, power, and language in large work environments, they found that female managers use more face-saving strategies (e.g. by formulating instructions as suggestions)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Computational Approaches towards Gender and Power", "text": "In the NLP community, this requires a considerable amount of work to analyze language usage in relation to gender issues. We have tried to automatically predict authors \"gender roles by endowing them with lexical traits. Researchers have tried to make gender predictions through a variety of interactions such as e-mails, blogs and online social networking sites such as Twitter (Corney et al., 2002; Peersman et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2011; Deitrick et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014). In more recent work, Hovy (2015) argues for research in the other direction that shows the importance of using gender information in relation to gender roles, identifying themes of identification, sensations and author attributes. While automatic recognition of gender roles is an interesting problem, we are not gender specific, but the variations in relation to gender roles."}, {"heading": "3. Gender Identified Enron Corpus", "text": "In this section, our starting point is the corpus (ENRON-ALL) used in our previous work (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2014), which is derived from the Enron email corpus (Klimt and Yang, 2004), which contains e-mails from the mailboxes of 145 \"core\" Enron employees published by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of irregularities in Enron. Our version of the corpus captures the hierarchical power relationships between 13,724 employee pairs assigned by Agarwal et al. (2012), as well as the thread structure of e-mail messages assigned semi-automatically by Yeh and Harnly (2006). The thread structure allows us to go beyond isolated messages and examine the gender in terms of the dialogue structure and language usage. However, there are 34,156 unique discourse participants (sender and recipient group together) who determine the large gender corpus across the bulk of the e-mail threads."}, {"heading": "3.1 Manual Gender Assignment", "text": "To ensure that the results are roughly the same person we want, we added the word enron to the searches. In the public records returned for each core employee, we searched for cases where they were designated with either a gender-identifying pronoun (he / she versus her / her) or a gender-identifying address form (male versus female / female / female). As these employees held managerial positions at Enron at the time of the bankruptcy, it was relatively easy to find public records or articles that referred to them. For example, the phrase \"Kay Mann is a strong addition to Noble's leadership team, and we are pleased to welcome her on board\" (gender-identifying pronoun emphasized) on the page we found for Kay Mann was clearly identifying her / her gender.2 We were able to accurately determine the gender of each of the 145 core employees in this way."}, {"heading": "3.2 Automatic Gender Assignment", "text": "Our corpus includes a large number of discourse participants in addition to the 145 core staff for whom we manually identified the gender. Gender assignment steps for these other discourse participants are graphically illustrated in Figure 1. We first determine the first names of discourse participants, then find out how ambiguous the names are by retrieving Social Security Authority (SSA) baby name records. In this section, we first describe how we calculate an ambiguity value for a name based on the SSA data set, and then describe how we use it to determine the gender of discourse participants in our corpus.2. http: / / www.prnewswire.com / news-releases / kay-mann-join-noble-as-general-counsel-57073687.html"}, {"heading": "3.2.1 SSA NAMES AND GENDER DATASET", "text": "The US Social Security Administration maintains a dataset of baby names, gender, and names for each year starting in the 1880s for names with at least five counts.3 We used this dataset to determine the gender ambiguity of a name. Enron's dataset includes emails from 1998 to 2001. We estimate the combined age range for a large company like Enron to be 24-67.4, so we use the 1931-1977 SSA data to calculate ambiguities for our purposes.For each name n in the database, mp (n) and fp (n) leave the percentage of men and women with the name n. The difference between these percentages of a name gives us a measure of how ambiguous it is; the smaller the difference, the more ambiguous the name. We define the ambiguity of the name n, the gender n."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 IDENTIFYING THE FIRST NAME", "text": "Each discourse participant in our corpus has at least one e-mail address and zero or more names associated with it. The name field is automatically compiled by Yeh and Harnly (2006), who have captured the various names of e-mail headers, and the names in the e-mail headers are populated by individual e-mail clients that use the senders, and thus do not follow a standard format. To make matters worse, not all discourse participants contain an e-mail address or show other irregularities, so it is not trivial to determine the first name of our discourse participants (e.g. a webmaster account, no reply address, etc.). The name field can sometimes be blank, contain multiple names, contain an e-mail address, or show other irregularities."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 COVERAGE AND ACCURACY", "text": "We evaluated the range and accuracy of our gender assignment system based on the manually assigned gender data of the 145 core subjects. We achieved a coverage of 90.3%, i.e., for 14 of the 145 core subjects, either the ambiguity of their name was above the threshold (Kam, Lindy, Tracy, Lynn, Chris, Stacy, Robin, Stacey and Tori) or their name did not exist in the SSA record (Geir and Vladi). Of the 131 persons to whom the system assigned a gender, we achieved an accuracy of 89.3% in correctly identifying the gender. We investigated the errors and found that all errors were caused by incorrect identification of the first name. In cases where we correctly identified the first name, we achieved 100% accuracy in assigning the gender. The errors in determining the first name arise because the name fields are automatically populated and sometimes the core discourse participants include their secrets, which we automatically assign to the other, middle gender and most of the positions."}, {"heading": "3.3 Corpus Statistics and Divisions", "text": "We apply the gender assignment system described above to all discourse participants of all kinds who are able to form the gender of the Enron Corpus (GIEC). Table 1 shows the gender assignment coverage in the GIEC corpus at various levels: unique discourse participants, messages and threads. We were able to identify the gender of the individual discourse participants in the corpus (e.g. HR department) as well as the majority of cases where the gender could not be assigned to the name of the sender who is not present in the SSA dataset. Mostly, the cases are where the discourse participant is not human."}, {"heading": "4. Notion of Gender Environment", "text": "In this study, we are interested not only in how the gender of a discourse participant influences their dialogue behavior, but also whether the gender of the other participants with whom they interact has an impact on their dialogue behavior. We use the term \"gender environment\" to refer to the gender composition of a group that communicates. We derive this notion from Holmes and Stubbe (2003), in which the term is applied to a stable working group that interacts regularly. As we are interested in the study of e-mail conversations (threads), we adapt this notion to refer to a single thread. We consider the \"gender environment\" to be specific to each discourse participant and to describe the other participants from his or her point of view. In other words, we use the term \"gender environment\" to model the (potential) audience of a discourse participant in a conversation. For example, a conversation between five women and a man looks like an all-female audience from a male point of view."}, {"heading": "5. Analysis Framework", "text": "For the rest of this paper, we will use the Enron Corpus All Participants Gender Identified (APGI) subset to examine the interplay of gender and power, as it allows us to examine the effects of gender and gender environment. We will use the same analytical framework - problem formulation, data splits, and characteristics - that was introduced in (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2014). In this section, we note that the concept of the gender environment could also be defined at the level of individual emails: not all emails in a thread include the same participants. We will leave this to future work. Summarize the analytical framework and the characteristics we use. For a more detailed description of the problem and characteristics, refer to (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2014)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Power Annotations", "text": "Our corpus contains organizational hierarchical relationships extracted from Enron's organizational charts by Agarwal et al. (2012). They define a dominance relationship as a relationship between superiors and subordinates in the hierarchy. Their gold standard for hierarchical relationships comprises a total of 1,518 employees. They found 2,155 direct dominance relationships spread across 65 levels of dominance (CEO, manager, trader, etc.) among these 1,518 employees. They also added the temporary closure of these relationships to the corpus, resulting in a total of 13,724 dominance relationships. We use these dominance relationships as our gold standard for assigning superior relationships."}, {"heading": "5.2 Problem Formulation", "text": "Let Pt be the set of all subscribers in t, i.e., the union of senders and recipients (To and CC) of all messages in t. Let IMt (P1, P2) indicate the set of interaction messages - not empty messages in t, where either p1 is the sender and p2 is one of the recipients or vice versa."}, {"heading": "5.3 Data", "text": "We follow the same move, dev, test department of ENRON-ALL as in (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2014). We limit our study to the threads in which the gender of all participants could be identified (i.e. threads that are part of the APGI subset of the corpus). Table 2 represents the total number of pairs in IPPt and RIPPt from all threads in the APGI subset of our corpus and across the entire turn, dev and test sets. We choose APGI instead of ASGI (All Senders Gender Identified) because APGI also allows us to study the notion of the gender environment for which we need to know the gender of all participants. As an artifact of choosing the APGI, we also have a corpus with a relatively smaller number of participants per thread than the full corpus. In other words, email threads with a large number of participants, such as broadcast emails, are excluded from the AGGI because there is sometimes a higher probability of the two subsets of the PI being true)."}, {"heading": "5.4 Features", "text": "We examine the same dialog-structural aspects of interaction introduced by (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2014) in this paper. In this section, we briefly describe the various features we use to model these aspects of interaction, focusing on features in five different dialog-structural aspects of interaction - POSITIONAL, VERBOSITY, THREAD STRUCTURE, and OVERT DISPLAY OF POWER, as well as on a non-structural aspect covered by LEXICAL features. The first three aspects (POSITIONAL, VERBOSITY, and THREAD STRUCTURE) capture the structure of message exchange without processing NLP on the content of the emails."}, {"heading": "5.4.1 POSITIONAL FEATURES", "text": "There are three features in this category - Initiator, FirstMsgPos and LastMsgPos. Initiator is a Boolean feature that gets a value of 1 (true) if the p has sent the first message in the thread, and 0 otherwise (false). FirstMsgPos and LastMsgPos are real rated features that take values from 0 to 1 and capture relative positions of the first and last p messages. The lower the value, the earlier the subscriber has sent his first (or last) message. The first two features relate to the subscriber's initiative. LastMsgPos tracks whether the subscriber stays until the end of the email thread."}, {"heading": "5.4.2 VERBOSITY FEATURES", "text": "This set of characteristics describes how verbose the participants in the thread were. There are five characteristics in this set - MsgCount, MsgRatio, TokenCount, TokenRatio, and TokenPerMsg. The first two characteristics measure the detail of p messages (raw number and percentage), while the third and fourth characteristics measure the detail of word marks in p messages (raw number and percentage), and the last characteristic measures how short or verbose the messages are on average p."}, {"heading": "5.4.3 THREAD STRUCTURE FEATURES", "text": "This set of features captures the structure of the email in the form of metadata that is part of the email header. It includes seven features - AvgRecipients, AvgToRecipients, InToList%, AddPerson, RemovePerson, and ReplyRate. The first two features capture the \"reach\" of the person in terms of the average number of total recipients and recipients in the to list in emails sent by p. InToList% captures the percentage of emails received by p in the to list (as opposed to the CC list); the next two features - AddPerson and RemovePerson - are Boolean features that indicate whether p has been added or removed when responding to a message. Next, we consider the responsiveness to p as the average number of replies received per message from p (ReplyRate)."}, {"heading": "5.4.4 DIALOG ACT FEATURES", "text": "We get Dialogact tags across the entire corpus using the automatic Dialogact tagger from our previous work (Omuya et al., 2013). The DA tagger designates each sentence as one of the four dialog actions. \u2022 REQUEST ACTION: The author signals her desire for the reader to perform a certain communicative action, i.e. an action that cannot in itself be part of the dialogue. \u2022 INFORM: The author can ask the reader to write a report or make coffee. \u2022 REQUEST INFORMATION: The author signals her desire for the reader to perform a certain communicative action, namely to transmit information (either facts or opinions)."}, {"heading": "5.4.5 OVERT DISPLAY OF POWER", "text": "We use the term overt representation of power (ODP) introduced in our previous work (Prabhakaran et al., 2012b) to measure aggravating actions in interactions. We define an expression that ODP has when interpreted as additional constraints on response beyond that provided by the general act of dialogue. We consider ODP as a pragmatic concept, i.e., in terms of the constraints of dialogue, an utterance is considered a manifestation of power, while \"Could you please try to send the report by the end of Friday\" is not considered as one. We consider ODP as a statement that initiates its response in terms of the constraints of dialogue, and not in terms of specific linguistic markers."}, {"heading": "5.4.6 LEXICAL FEATURES", "text": "In addition to the dialog structure features, we also used simple lexical ngram features that have proven valuable in predicting power relationships (Bramsen et al., 2011; Gilbert, 2012). We use the feature set LEXICAL to capture word terminology, POS (part of the language) ngrams, and mixed ngrams. A mixed ngram is a special case of word ngram where words belonging to open classes are replaced by their POS tags, allowing longer sequences to be captured without increasing the dimensionality as much as word grams. We found that the best setting is to use both unigrams and bigrams for all three types of ngrams by tuning our dev set."}, {"heading": "6. Gender and Power: A Statistical Analysis", "text": "As a first step, we would like to understand whether male superiors, female superiors, male subordinates and female subordinates differ in their dialog behavior. ANOVA (analysis of variance) is the appropriate statistical test for this analysis, as it provides a way to test whether the means of several groups are equal or not. In other words, ANOVA generalizes the t-test of the student to situations with more than two groups. It also eliminates the possibility of making a type I error (false positive) when applying several t-tests from two samples to such a problem. We perform ANOVA tests on all dialog structure characteristics - POSITIONAL, VERBOSITY, THROT STRUCTURE, DIALOG-ACTS and OVER DISPLAY OF POWER, considering both hierarchical power and gender as independent variables."}, {"heading": "6.1 Positional Features", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules that they have shown in recent years, and they will be able to play by the rules that they have shown."}, {"heading": "6.2 Verbosity Features", "text": "There are five characteristics in this category - MsgCount, MsgRatio, TokenCount, TokenRatio, and TokenPerMsg. The first two characteristics measure the expressiveness in terms of messages, while the third and fourth characteristics measure the expressiveness in words. The last characteristic measures how concise or literal the messages are on average. MsgCount and MsgRatio behaved similarly, as did TokenCount and TokenRatio. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the averages of each group for the MsgCount and TokenCount characteristics. Superior send fewer messages in the thread than inferiors (p < 0.001), and women tend to send fewer messages than men (p < 0.001). The ANOVA results for both MsgCount and MsgRatio are significant (p < 0.001)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Thread Structure Features", "text": "While detail and position characteristics measure behavioral aspects, thread structure characteristics generally address functional aspects (e.g., is a participant in CC (carbon copy) much?). Although participation in CC as a trait is significantly related to power relationships, it is unlikely that someone will leave a person in CC because of their gender. Similarly, adding or removing people for conversation is also a functional aspect of workplace interactions, and we do not expect gender to play a role there. As expected, there is no significant difference between women and men for InToList%, AddPerson, and RemovePerson. The ANOVA test also found no significant impact on the way superiors and inferiors behave with respect to these goals. Results from our analysis of ReplyRate are interesting. Figure 10 shows the averages for each group. Women receive significantly more responses to their messages p < 0.001. While power has no significant impact, the ANVA result is also significant."}, {"heading": "6.4 Dialog Act Features", "text": "InformCount and ConventionalCount behave similarly for all three tests. However, the difference between superiors and subordinates for InformCount is much greater than that for ConventionalCount (superiors had a 42.4% lower value than subordinates for InformCount compared to 13.8% for ConventionalCount).The ANOVA test showed no significant difference between men and women, meaning that the gender did not affect the way superiors or subordinates use conventional or informative dialogue activities (Figure 12), whereas they significantly differed (p < 0.001) in terms of the frequency in which they request information, and not the subordinates. Women submit almost 41% more information requests than men. The ANOVA test for ReqtionCount showed a significant difference between male and female requests for superiors, but not for superiors."}, {"heading": "6.5 Overt Displays of Power", "text": "The results are similar to those we found for ReqActionCount. Power and gender are significant on their own, with subordinates averaging 0.091 ODP counts and supervisors averaging 0.114 ODP counts. Gender is also significant: women average 0.086 ODP counts and men average 0.113 ODP counts. However, when looking at the factor groups of power and gender, several differences are very significant: male supervisors use most ODPs with an average of 0.135 points. Somewhat surprisingly, female supervisors use the smallest of the entire group with an average of 0.072 points. However, the differences between female supervisors, female subordinates and male subordinates are not significant, as in the Tukey HSD test."}, {"heading": "6.6 Summary and Discussion", "text": "In summary, we note that gender significantly influences the manifestations of power along many linguistic and structural aspects of interactions. We summarize our findings as follows: \u2022 The gender of the participants does not have a great influence on the manifestations of power in position traits (ref. Section 6.1) \u2022 Gender also influences the manifestations of power in characteristics of embodiment; the ANOVA tests we performed on the five characteristics of embodiment, three of which have been found to be highly significant. (ref. Section 6.2) \u2022 Gender also influences the manifestations of power in some characteristics of the thread structure such as response rate and number of recipients. (ref. Section 6.3) \u2022 Power manifestations in the dialog action traits, in particular the requirement traits and exaggerated displays of power are also strongly influenced by the gender of the participants. (ref. Section 6.4 and Section 6.5) The findings presented in this section do not exhaust the possibilities of this corpus."}, {"heading": "7. Statistical Analysis: Gender Environment and Power", "text": "As in Section 6, we use the ANOVA test to assess the statistical significance of differences. We perform ANOVA tests on all characteristics where both power and gender environment (GenderEnv, hereinafter) are retained as independent variables. We also perform ANOVA, where GenderEnv alone remains as an independent variable; since GenderEnv comprises more than two groups, we cannot use the student's t-test. We review our general hypothesis that gender environments influence the way power manifests itself in interactions; this also applies to multiple tests after applying the Bonferroni correction. However, as in Section 6, we do not apply the correction when describing the results of statistical analysis of each characteristic separately in the rest of this section."}, {"heading": "7.1 Positional Features", "text": "For the position characteristics, any difference we see in the characteristic values between different gender environments is not interesting. For example, it is not useful to investigate whether the value of the initiator is different between gender environments (all threads had to be initiated by someone), but it is interesting to see if there is a connection between the gender environment and how supervisors and subordinates differ in terms of starting and ending participation in the threads. As we saw in Section 6, subordinates initiate more emails than superiors (initiators) and generally start participating in the thread earlier (FirstMsgPos). The ANOVA test, which maintains power and GenderEnv as independent variables, was highly significant (p < 0.001). In other words, the gender environment influences the initiative shown by subordinates at the start of email threads. Figure 15 shows the mean values of each group. Subordinates start participating in the threads significantly earlier than their superiors."}, {"heading": "7.2 Verbosity Features", "text": "According to the ANOVA results, the gender environment has no significance in MsgCount or in the manifestation of power in MsgCount. However, there is a significant difference (p < 0.01) between gender environments with regard to TokenCount (Figure 16). The ANOVA test, which leaves Power and GenderEnv as independent variables, also showed a significance (p < 0.001). In fact, in male environments, there is no significant difference in TokenCount between superiors and subordinates. Subordinates behaved more or less the same across gender environments, but superiors contributed much less in female and mixed environments. A similar pattern can be observed in TokenPerMsg across gender environments."}, {"heading": "7.3 Thread Structure Features", "text": "We observed that the number of recipients (both AvgRecipients and AvgToRecipients) in a mixed environment is significantly higher than in others. However, this is another artifact of the construction of our corpus. In a thread with a large number of participants, it is more likely to have a mixed environment than a male or female environment. The ANOVA test, which retains Power and GenderEnv, also showed no significance for AddPerson and RemovePerson. In summary, the effect of the gender environment on the characteristics of the thread structure is minimal."}, {"heading": "7.4 Dialog Act Features", "text": "The results of the ANOVA tests for dialogue activities are interesting. Let's start with the Conventional Count. Figure 17 shows the mean values of Conventional Count in each subgroup of participants. Hierarchical power is highly significant according to ANOVA results. Subordinates use conventional language more (0.60) than superiors (0.52). While the averages of GenderEnv differ, the differences are not significant. In the Tukey HSD test, the two groups show highly significant differences. Subordinates in female environments use the most conventional language of all six groups, with an average of 0.79. Superiors in female environments use the least, with an average of 0.48. In the Tukey HSD test, the only significantly different pairs are exactly the subordinates in female environments paired with each other group. That is, subordinates in female environments use significantly more conventional environments than subordinates."}, {"heading": "7.5 Overt Displays of Power", "text": "The results of the ANOVA analysis of ODPCount are interesting: Figure 19 shows the mean values of each group. As we have already seen in Section 6, superiors use significantly more open power representations than subordinates. However, this pattern differed significantly from gender environment to gender environment. The same ratio applies only to a mixed gender environment, in which most ODPCount occurs. In male environments there is no significant difference in ODPCount between superiors and subordinates, whereas in female environments the value of ODPCount for superiors is significantly lower than the value of subordinates. This coincides with our finding in Section 6 that female executives use less open power representations."}, {"heading": "7.6 Summary and Discussion", "text": "We summarize the main findings as follows: \u2022 The gender environment influences the difference between the initiative (in terms of the way it takes place in the female environment) and the gender environment (in which the female environment is influenced by superiors and subordinates). \u2022 While the subjects show more initiative than the superiors, the magnitude of these differences is greatest in the female environment. \u2022 This difference affects the difference between superiors and subordinates."}, {"heading": "8.

Conclusion", "text": "The first contribution in this paper is the new freely available resource - Gender Identified Enron Corpus, an extension of the Enron email corpus with 87% of the identified gender of the e-mail sender.

Our second contribution is the detailed statistical analysis of the interaction of gender, gender environment and power how they influence the dialogue behavior of participants in an interaction. We introduced the concept of the gender environment to capture the gender composition of discourse participants in a particular interaction.

We focus especially on manifestations of power in the dialog structure \u2014 both, in a shallow sense that disregards the textual content of messages (e.g., how often do the participants contribute, how often do they get replies etc.), as well as the structure that is expressed within the textual content (e.g., who issues requests and how are they made, whose requests get responses etc.). We find that both gender and gender environment affect the ways power is manifested in dialog, resulting in patterns that reveal the underlying factors. Finally, we show the utility of gender information in the problem of automatically predicting the direction of power between pairs of participants in email interactions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
