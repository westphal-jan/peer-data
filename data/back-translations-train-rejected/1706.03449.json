Scientific document summarization addresses this challenge by providing summaries of the important contributions of scientific papers. We present a framework for scientific summarization which takes advantage of the citations and the scientific discourse structure. Citation texts often lack the evidence and context to support the content of the cited paper and are even sometimes inaccurate. We first address the problem of inaccuracy of the citation texts by finding the relevant context from the cited paper. We propose three approaches for contextualizing citations which are based on query reformulation, word embeddings, and supervised learning. We then train a model to identify the discourse facets for each citation. We finally propose a method for summarizing scientific papers by leveraging the faceted citations and their corresponding contexts. We evaluate our proposed method on two scientific summarization datasets in the biomedical and computational linguistics domains. Extensive evaluation results show that our methods can improve over the state of the art by large margins.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 03:21:38 GMT  (207kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03449v1", "Preprint.

It consists of the following steps: 1. Citation contextualisation (extraction of the relevant context from the reference paper) 2. Identification of the discourse facet of the extracted contextual3. Summary We first explain our suggested methods for contextualisation, then describe our approach to identifying the discourse facets of the citation contexts and finally outline our summary approach. 3.1 Citation contextualisation refers to the extraction of the relevant context from the reference article for a given citation text. We propose the following three approaches to this problem: (i) Query Reformulation, (ii) Word Embedings and Domain Knowledge and (iii) Supervised Classification."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Query reformulation (QR)", "text": "This year it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Contextualization using word embeddings and domain knowledge", "text": "To explicitly account for variations in terms and paraphrases between quoting and the cited authors, we propose a different model for contextualizing terms, using word embeddings and domain-specific knowledge. [5] Empirically, we set this threshold to 1.9 and 2.2 for the TAC and CL SciSum datasets, with similar words close to each other [6]. We extend the Language Modeling (LM) for the information model by using word embeddings for term variations, in the face of a quotation text (query) q, and a reference span (document) d, which generates LM scores d based on the probability that d q (p)."}, {"heading": "3.1.3 Supervised classification", "text": "It is only a matter of time before it will happen, until it will happen."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "Our work offers new approaches to contextualizing citations, which are a subset of the task of enriching citation texts and can therefore benefit from various bibliometrically enhanced NLP applications, such as information extraction, information gathering, article recommendation, and article summary. Our work provides a comprehensive new framework for summarizing scientific papers that contributes to the creation of better scientific summaries. We note that our evaluation is based on the rouge system for automatic summary summaries. Automatic evaluation metrics have their own limitations and cannot fully characterize the effectiveness of systems. Manual or semi-manual summary evaluations (e.g. through the pyramid system) are alternative evaluation approaches that can provide additional insights into the performance of systems."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We presented a unified framework for scientific summaries; our framework consists of three main parts: finding the context for the quotations in the reference paper, identifying the discourse facet of each quotation context, and creating the summary from the multi-faceted quotation contexts. We used query reformulation methods, word embedding, and domain knowledge to capture the terminological variations between quoting and quoted authors. In addition, we used the scientific discourse structure of the articles. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in two scientific summary benchmarks, each in a different area. We significantly improved on the state of the art in most tasks. Although the results are encouraging, the absolute values of some metrics, especially in the contextualization task, suggest that this problem is worth further exploration. Contextualizing citations is a new task and not only contributes to improving the scientific summary, but can also serve as a biometric end-end-end-end-end-end-end-end-end-end-end-search for other key-end-end-end-end-end-end-end-references."}], "references": [{"title": "Purpose and polarity of citation: Towards nlp-based bibliometrics", "author": ["A.

Citation texts often lack the evidence and context to support the content of the cited paper and are even sometimes inaccurate. We first address the problem of inaccuracy of the citation texts by finding the relevant context from the cited paper. We propose three approaches for contextualizing citations which are based on query reformulation, word embeddings, and supervised learning. We then train a model to identify the discourse facets for each citation. We finally propose a method for summarizing scientific papers by leveraging the faceted citations and their corresponding contexts. We evaluate our proposed method on two scientific summarization datasets in the biomedical and computational linguistics domains. Extensive evaluation results show that our methods can improve over the state of the art by large margins. \u2217 This is a pre-print of an article published on IJDL.
