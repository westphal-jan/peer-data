The hybrid system combining heuristics and machine learning methods includes a number of relevant selection criteria. We focus on two fundamental aspects: linguistic complexity and the dependence of the extracted sentences on their original context. Previous work on exercise generation addressed these two criteria only to a limited extent, and a refined overall candidate sentence selection framework appears also to be lacking. In addition to a detailed description of the system, we present the results of an empirical evaluation conducted with language teachers and learners which indicate the usefulness of the system for educational purposes.

In addition, this framework includes, among other things, assessing the complexity of L2 sentences and their independence from the surrounding context, both of which are relevant for a wide range of application scenarios. ToSentence selection for exercises 21our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study addressing automatic seed selection for L2 learning exercises. We invested considerable effort in creating a system that would provide more pedagogically relevant results. We conducted an empirical evaluation with L2 teachers and learners to gain insights into how successfully the proposed framework can be used to identify seed sets for L2 exercises. Although the sample size was somewhat limited, the evaluation resulted in very promising results. On average, the sentences selected met teachers \"expectations for the complexity of L2, context independence and general suitability for the system. The overall level of sentences were difficult to construct, but the exercises were suitable for a set of use."}, {"heading": "6. References", "text": "Arregik I.
