First, we briefly outline the main ideas behind the definition. However, due to our attitude to a particular multivariate Markov chain that actions must take place within our concept of action, we differ only slightly from other actions, what distinguishes actions between events is that they happen not only to individuals, but rather that they happen through individuals. This is problematic in our setting in which STPs (as beings) assume the role of individuals. What \"happens\" in a multivariate Markov chain is the trajectories and the STPs actions within them. The dynamics of the Markov chain are determined by its mechanisms pj, t with j P J J J J J T. These in turn determine (possibly stochastically) what happens anywhere within the chain.Therefore, it is impossible for a multivariate Markov chain of actions to take place."}, {"heading": "5 Entity perception", "text": "In this section, we formally define perception for (STP) entities. We make no distinction here between perception, experience and sensory perception. In the tradition of modeling agent environments, we have a similar problem as with actions. An entity is already a fixed STP that contains all the influences it may have subjected. In this sense, the result is the influence (or no influence) on its environment. In order to investigate these influences, we need to deconstruct the entity and see how it has been \"shaped\" by external influences / perceptions of time slice. The idea is to fix the past of the entity up and fix the use of the reciprocal entities as an alternative future."}, {"heading": "6 Entity action and perception in the PA-loop", "text": "We now show that it is a pair of pmT in which mT is an entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity-activity-entity-entity-entity-entity-entity"}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We have defined actions and perceptions for entity sets and thus for sets of spatio-temporal patterns. This offers a formally defined possibility to link gliders and similar spatio-temporal patterns in reaction diffusion systems with actions and perceptions. This is a step towards a formalization of the agency capacity of such patterns. Here, there is still no idea of goal orientation and future work. We have also shown how our definitions specialize in a necessary and sufficient condition for non-heteronomy and the common notion of perceptions of the agent process in the PAloop. For future research, it is interesting to note that the branch morphs generalizations of the conditional probability distribution pMt '1p. | et, mtq are. These conditional probability distributions play a role in various information theoretical concepts formulated for the PA loop. This indicates that we may be able to set supertemporal patterns between such bacterial PA and bacterial PA patterns."}], "references": [{"title": "Detecting emergent processes in cellular automata with excess information", "author": ["D.
