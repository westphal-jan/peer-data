It consists of CDRs (Call Detail Records) with historical location data and calls made during a week in a medium-sized region of Sweden with more than a thousand radio cells. Multiple cells may be located on the same antenna. Cell density varies in different areas and is higher in city centers than in rural areas. The locations of 27010 customers are registered along with the cell serving the customer. The location is registered every five minutes. In the periods in which the customer does not generate traffic, it does not affect the infrastructure and such periods of inactivity are not included in the resource allocation analysis. Each customer in the database is labeled with his MOSAIC segment. The fields used in this study are: \u2022 the cell IDs containing the information a user serves at different time points, the location coordinates for each segment, the location coordinates for each AIC, the location coordinates for each AIC, the time table for each AIC, the time table for each AIC, the location coordinates for each AIC, the time table for each AIC, the location coordinates for each AIC, the time table for each AIC, the location coordinates for each AIC, the location coordinates for each AIC, the time table for each AIC, the location coordinates for each AIC, the time table for each AIC, the time table for each AIC, the location coordinates for each AIC and the time table for each segment."}, {"heading": "3 A Link between IS and Geo-demographic Segments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Notation and Definitions", "text": "Definition (in the style of [Zadeh, 1965]): A blurred group A in X is characterized by a membership function fA (x), which associates with each dot in X a real number in the interval [0, 1], where the value of fA (x) in x represents the \"degree of membership\" of x in A. For the opposite quality: fnotA (x) = 1- fA (x). Blurred membership reflects the different degree to which different cases belong to a sentence: \u2022 Below the six blurred value, there are six levels of membership 1: fully in, 0.9: mostly but not fully in, 0.6: more or less in, 0.4: more or less out, 0.1: mostly, but not completely out, 0: completely out. \u2022 Thus, blurred sets combine qualitative and quantitative evaluation: 1 and 0 are qualitative assignments (\"fully in\" or \"fully out\"); between 0 and 1 indicate a blurred membership."}, {"heading": "3.2 Query Formulation", "text": "As mentioned above, within the same geo-demographic segment, the clients differ in terms of being or not being. If the infrastructure is not overloaded, that is, the current historical load is still significantly smaller than the capacity, then practically every client is welcome. The following two queries reflect the desire to apply context-based strategies. As the infrastructure is under greater strain, the operator wants to be more discriminatory in terms of the degree of thesis / IF quality. This, in turn, is formulated as a fuzzy variable: floaded (antenna j) = max all t {load (j, t) capacity (antenna j) -1} -1}}. The floaded (antenna j) -1} -it is calculated in the man units. The load in the analyzed zone is set to the maximum demand: floaded (infrastructure j) = maxall the antennas antennas."}, {"heading": "3.3 Query Simulation", "text": "In deciding which context to apply, we have relied on an intuitive rule: If the load 1 field userID of tentativeStressingUsers < Hedge X2 > is large, then < Hedge X > IS segments are suitable for recruiting customers. It does not need to be held because the calibration of fuzzy functions depends on the expected outcome of the campaign and the consequent impact on the infrastructure. For example, the campaign can attract 300 new customers or 1,500 new customers. To avoid false negatives, the Fuzzy-Heuristic is subjected to a validation process that simulates the effects of the expected result on the infrastructure. I. It issues a warning when an antenna is overloaded, that is, if the expected footprint of the segment violates a restriction for some segments i, some antennas j, some time points t: \u03b1 Si, j, t \u2264 Cj, where it is an efficient scaling number of total clients, \u03b1 = 1 expected number of new customers."}, {"heading": "4 Experiment", "text": "1. Disclosure of IS clients. Applying the IS client detection algorithm, we have expanded the data set with a field labeled IS or Not IS as a descriptor for each client. 2. Calculate the level of infrastructure friendliness for each segment. Graphs showing the number of customers in each MOSAIC and Telenor segment in the geographic region are shown in Figures 2 and 3. Across the entire customer base, 7% of subscribers have been identified as IS [Sidorova et al, 2017]. We have obtained the distribution of IS clients within the MOSAIC and Telenor segments and shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The level of infrastructure friendliness is shown in Table 1 and 2 for MOSAIC and Telenor segments, each with respect to these segments. II. The assignment behind the queries. Tables 1 and 2 simulate the reasons behind the queries results for different segments with MOSA- > as the contexts, or rather as the MOSI with a very large array of codes."}, {"heading": "6 Results", "text": "When it comes to designing strategies to accommodate many more customers, the vulnerability of IS to a segment is an important characteristic. We have investigated the correlation between IS users and MOSAIC segments, motivated by the fact that we can target MOSAIC segments in marketing campaigns. We have created candidate rankings of geodemographic segments for different contexts, and given the lack of other preferences, the top segments are preferable. Which of several candidate segments is selected depends on the level of protection calculated for the intensity of infrastructure exploitation. Verification / simulation does not guarantee false negatives, such as that certain segments are safe to rent but would actually result in a service outage somewhere on the network."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}], "references": [{"title": "Extending geodemographic classification: a new regional prototype", "author": ["J.
