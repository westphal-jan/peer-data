It consists of CDRs (Call Detail Records) with historical location data and calls made during a week in a medium-sized region of Sweden with more than a thousand radio cells. Multiple cells may be located on the same antenna. Cell density varies in different areas and is higher in city centers than in rural areas. The locations of 27010 customers are registered together with the cell that serves the customer. The location is registered every five minutes. In the periods in which the customer does not generate traffic, it does not affect the infrastructure and such periods of inactivity are not included in the resource allocation analysis. Each customer in the database is labeled with its geo-demographic segment of the SC. The fields used in this study are: \u2022 the cell IDs with the information about which user serves the telecommunications segment, the MOC location coordinates for each of the MOCs, the location of each AICs, the location of each AICs, and the location of each MOCs of the AICs."}, {"heading": "3 The Combinatorial Optimization Module", "text": "The individual mobility patterns of different user segments add up to their collective footprint, which the entire customer base on the infrastructure produces in a continuous manner over time. A desirable feature of such a collective footprint is that it does not have lean peaks and gaps in time. The closer the optimal \"self-load\" scenario is, the better the infrastructure is used. Variables: \u2022 clientSet: set of with customer IDs; \u2022 I: set of geo-demographic segments {segment1,..., segment} the mobility data for a region containing the ID for each user; clients geo-demographic segment; timestamps when the client generates traffic and the antenna serves the customer. \u2022 Si: the number of subscribers belonging to a geo-demographic segment i; \u2022 Si *: the optimal number of subscribers belonging to a geographic segment."}, {"heading": "4.

A blurred sentence A in X is characterized by a membership function fA (x), which associates with each dot in X a real number in the interval [0, 1], with the value of fA (x) in x, which represents the \"degree of membership\" of x in A. For the opposite quality: fnotA (x) = 1- fA (x). Blurred membership ratings reflect the different degree to which different cases belong to a sentence: \u2022 Among the six value-blurred, there are six levels of membership 1: complete in, 0.9: predominant but not complete in, 0.6: more or less in, 0.4: more or less in, 0.1: mostly, but not completely out, 0: complete out. \u2022 Thus, blurred sentences combine qualitative and quantitative assessment: 1 and 0 are qualitative mappraisals in relation to the mapping (\"full\" and \"out\")."}, {"heading": "4.2.

The numerical analysis results in this case study are translated into cognitively comprehensive conclusions that are not polluted by insignificant numerical fluctuations. In the process of extracting historical data from a telecommunications provider, the optimal proportion of geo-demographic segments in the customer base was identified, functionality was developed to evaluate the outcome of planned marketing campaigns, and trade between the granularity of segmentation and the efficiency of campaigns was investigated. The above analyses were implemented as queries via the historical mobility database."}], "references": [{"title": "Unprofitable customers and their management", "author": ["M. Haenlein", "A.M.
