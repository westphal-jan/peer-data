Each sentence is characterised by distinct F0 patterns, which are perceived as distinct melodies, such as questions, statements, commands and requests. The aim of this study is to provide a classification model of Cypriot-Greek statements and questions, using information from their basic frequency contours (F0) (for a description of Cypriot-Greek intonation see Themistocleous, 2011, 2016). To this end, two different neural network architectures were tested: a neural long-term memory (LSTM) and a convolutionary neural network (ConvNet)."}, {"heading": "Properties of Tonal Contours", "text": "In broad-focus statements, each phonological word is associated with rising and falling melodies; the whole melody usually begins with a higher frequency and gradually drops to a lower frequency (see Figure 1, top right). In contrast, Wh questions are characterized either by a persistent melody with a high frequency (see Figure 1, top left) or by a high deep melody in the Wh word, followed by a case and an optional increase at the end of the utterance (Figure 1, bottom). Noteworthy is the automatic classification of intonation, as the tonal contours may differ depending on linguistic and non-linguistic factors, including the segmental structure of utterances, the distribution of lexical loads, the speaking speed, and the physiology of speakers (gender, age, etc.). These factors influence the overall structure of tonal patterns, such as the frequency range and the length of utterance."}, {"heading": "Artificial Network Architectures", "text": "LSTMs are recurring neural architectures (RNN) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) that have proven to be extremely powerful and dynamic systems for detecting, processing, and predicting tasks such as time series characterized by time delays of unknown magnitude and bound between major events (Schmidhuber, Wierstra, and Gomez, 2005). LSTMs performed strongly in solving speech recognition problems (Graves, et al. 2013), rhythm learning (Gers, Schraudolph, and Schmidhuber, 2002), etc. However, one disadvantage of using LSTMs (and RNNs in general) is that they are slower in terms of powering forward networks (ConvNets). ConvNets are forward neural networks that learn patterns in restricted regions (a.k.a.), receptive fields that partially overlap. These architectures were inspired by biological processes of visual perception."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "For the purposes of this study, 1966 account statements of 25 female speakers and 2860 Wh questions of 20 female speakers of Cypriot Greek were produced. Audio files were segmented and labeled, and the corresponding F0 contours were extracted every 12.5 ms. Data was then supplemented with zeros for a total length of 1024 and provided as input for our models. Account statements consisted of the same statement code \"ipes CVCV pali,\" which you again called CVCV, with C representing a consonant and V representing a vowel, while Wh questions varied both in length and in the initial Whword. For the purposes of this study, a double experiment was applied, namely a classification problem with a neural network of the LSTM and a classification problem with a ConvNet. Figure 3. Examples of learned convolutional filters for the first shift."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We have described two artificial neural network architectures: an LSTM and a Convolutionary Network. ConvNet has surpassed the LSTM in accuracy and speed. Specifically, SchmidvNet achieves high performance in question and statement classification without requiring external features, such as manually marked tone accents. The network itself can identify the characteristics of the tonal contour that are most important for classification. Despite the high accuracy, the learned characteristics cannot be easily interpreted from a linguistic point of view (see Figure 3), one promising aspect of this architecture is that it requires only a few parameters (only 6 filters). However, this study was conducted on a corpus that exhibits regularities and it remains to be seen whether it is generalized in a more diverse corpus.
