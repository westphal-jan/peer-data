Dung [Dung, 1995] notes that formal reasoning \"naturally captures the way people argue to justify their solutions to many social problems.\" This is one of the most common assertions used to support research into formal reasoning, but more recently there have been a number of empirical studies to investigate this claim [Rahwan and Reed, 2009, Cerutti et al., 2014, Rosenfeld and Kraus, 2016b]. However, the results have been far from conclusive. Using graphic models to represent arguments is the most common approach used in the formal reasoning community to capture argumentation structures."}, {"heading": "2 Running Example", "text": "On 22 June 2012, in the midst of the European debt crisis, the Moral Labyrinth programme on BBC Radio 4 devoted itself to the subject of individual and national debt, including Nick Dearden, Director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, and Claire Fox of the Institute of Ideas during the Witnesses programme (contributors who expressed a particular viewpoint in the debate) What follows is an excerpt analysed to identify the argumentation network in dialogue and made available at http: / / aifdb.org / argview / 1724 [Lawrence et al., 2012]. In this paper, we focus on the part of the argumentation network shown in Figure 1, and we highlight in the text the elements that contribute to the creation of such a network of arguments. CLAIRE FOX: I understand that. I suspect my concern is exactly this: I want the freedom to write off debt, but - I'm sure you see this kind of sense among a crowd of young people who just want to think that I think it's moral: I think it's just me."}, {"heading": "3 Background", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Argumentation Schemes", "text": "Argumentation programs [Walton et al., 2008, Walton, 2009] are abstract thought patterns often used in the everyday reasoning of conversations, legal, scientific arguments, etc. Schemes have been derived from empirical studies of human arguments and debates, and can capture both traditional deductive and inductive approaches as well as plausible reasoning. Each scheme has a set of critical questions, which are standard methods of critically questioning an argument in order to find aspects of it that are worthy of criticism. In the dialogue described in Section 2, for example, part of Nick's position can be mapped into an example with the following structure: premise: In this particular case, the individual a has property F and also property G. Conclusion: If x has property F, it also has property G. One of the critical questions here is: \"Is the statement proclaimed in the premise actually true?\""}, {"heading": "3.2 Representing an Argument Network", "text": "The argument Interchange Format (AIF) [Chesnevar et al., 2006, Rahwan and Reed, 2009] is the current proposal for a standard notation for argument structures. It is based on a graph that specifies two types of nodes: information nodes (or I nodes) and schema nodes (or S nodes), which are represented by two disjunct sentences, NI Y NS \"N and NI X NS\" H, where information nodes represent claims, premises, data, etc., and schema nodes capture the application of argument patterns leading to a series S \"SR Y SC Y SP, SR X SC\" SP \"X SR\" H. Reasoning patterns can consist of three types: rule of reference SR; criteria of preference SP; and criteria of conflicts SC. The relationship fulfills SR Y SC Y SP SP, SR X SC \"SP\" SP \"H. Reasoning patterns can consist of three types of reference types: rule and criteria of preference SR; and criteria of preference SP."}, {"heading": "3.3 Deductive Argumentation", "text": "The use of deductive reasoning means that each argument is defined using a logic, and in the following we adopt the simple but elegant logic proposed by Besnard and J\u00e4ger. Consequently, L is a logical language. If \u03b1 in L is an atom, then its addition in L is a positive word, and \u03b1 is a negative word in L. For a literal \u03b2, the addition of the positive word is \u03b2 \"\u03b1\" \u03b2 \"\u03b1 (or if \u03b2\" \u03b1 is not a positive word, its addition is the positive word \u03b2 \"\u03b1.\" A simple rule is of the form \u03b11 ^."}, {"heading": "3.4 Abstract Argumentation", "text": "The argumentation of the S-P-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E"}, {"heading": "3.5 Natural Language Generation", "text": "A natural generation (NLG) requires answering the question of why. A source of knowledge must be used. (Table 1: Modules and tasks of an NLG system, adapted by [Reiter and Dale, 2006) In general, the source of knowledge is information about the domain, while the communicative target describes the purpose of the text to be generated. The user model is a characterization of the intended audience, and the discourse history is a model of what was said so. An NLG system divides the processing into a pipeline [Reiter and Dale], which is described in three stages. Firstly, it determines the content and structure of a document (document planning), and discourse history is a model used to communicate the content. (Reiter and Dale, 2006)."}, {"heading": "4 Generating Natural Language Interfaces to Formal Argumentation", "text": "Let us now return to our running example to illustrate four relevant communicative objectives: At the moment, we do not make assumptions about the user model and do not start from a pre-existing history of discourse. As the source of knowledge is established, we envision the following four communicative objectives, each of which raises interesting and challenging questions: 1. Presentation of a single argument or an approximate argument; 2. Presentation of an entire argumentation network; 3. Explanation of the acceptance status of a single argument or an approximate argument; and 4. Explanation of the extensions taking into account some semantics. In the following, we will discuss elements of determining the content of each of these objectives; i.e., deciding which messages should be included in the document to be generated. Examples will be provided using our running example. In parts, the texts generated will sound somewhat uncomfortable because we have consciously chosen not to change the content of the arguments."}, {"heading": "4.1 Presenting a Simple or an Approximate Argument", "text": "There are two important strategies that are traditionally used to represent such a construct: \u2022 write forward, maintain premises; \u2022 write backwards, 1 from claim to premise. Consider the argument b \"xt [T4], [T4] \u00d1 [T3] u, [T3] y.\" In the case of write forward, we can write something like: \"If you want the economy to run smoothly, you need to encourage certain behaviors. [T4] In a way, you don't need this discipline to be a saver, to think,\" I'm not going to get into debt. \"\" [T3] An explicit signal like this can therefore be used to justify the relationship: if you want the economy to run smoothly, you need to encourage certain behaviors, you need to encourage certain behaviors, certain behaviors. \"[T4] stimulate certain behaviors to think.\""}, {"heading": "4.2 Presenting an Argument Network", "text": "One of the strengths of formal reasoning is its ability to deal with conflicts. In the previous section, we focused on how to present a single argument, but even in our small running example, we can see that (1) there is more than one argument; and (2) there are conflicts between them (Figures 1 and 2). The simplest strategy for representing an argumentation network is to list all the arguments and enumerate the conflicts among themselves, which ultimately leads to critical questions when the information is available (e.g. this counter-argument answers the critical question that states are asking..) However, we argue that there is a better approach motivated by the need to satisfy Grice's maxim of relationship and relevance [Grice, 1975]. That is, you have to be relevant in a conversation and say things that are relevant to the discussion."}, {"heading": "4.3 Explaining the Acceptability Status of a Single Argument or an Approximate Argument", "text": "Two of the traditional decision problems in abstract reasoning [Dunne and Wooldridge, 2009] examine whether or not an argument is accepted gullible or skeptical. An interested user could select one of the arguments (or one of the theses in the argumentation network) and ask whether or not it is accepted gullible or skeptical. To answer such a question, we can use research results in evidence theory and argument games [Modgil and Caminada, 2009]. For example, to prove that c (in Figure 2) is accepted gullibly according to preferred semantics, we can (1) calculate the extensions and (2) calculate the dispute tree needed to prove it. [Modgil and Caminada, 2009] The dispute tree is shown in Figure 4, which suggests that only the argument network of c, d and b must be taken into account."}, {"heading": "4.4 Explaining Extensions", "text": "The explanation of multiple extensions corresponds to the presentation of different argumentation (sub-) networks linked by attacks. Therefore, the solution to this communication objective is based on the procedures provided for in sections 4.2 and 4.3. It is worth noting that one possible way of identifying the attack links between these extensions is to take into account a series of arguments pertaining to a series of questions S P Eissuespeciq, so that the text presented in section 4.2 could be easily adapted to communicate the existence of two preferred extensions tending around the topic tb, du.4Assuming that semantics may be related to the notion of complete labelling (Def. 4)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have a blueprint for a complex set of research questions that arise when you think about how to present natural-language representations of formal argumentation structures.First of all, as mentioned at the beginning of Section 4, we assume that neither a user model, nor pre-existing contexts that need to be generated in the piece of text, actually constitute a single text-agnostic normal form of proposition. In this way, we could compose them in a way that argues in a meaningful manner. Clearly, this is a limitation that could be unnatural when an untrained user attempts to create an argumentation network, and this raises an interesting research question of how to formalize untrained users \"lines of reasoning."}], "references": [{"title": "On bipolarity in argumentation frameworks", "author": ["Amgoud et al", "L. 2008] Amgoud", "C.
