INTRODUCTIONThe average age of the world population has experienced a progressive increase over the last 50 years, mainly due to advances in medicine and health care. Nevertheless, a physically active lifestyle is important to reduce or avoid physical problems such as cardiorespiratory problems. Ageing society and the need to promote healthy habits in the population represent a major challenge for public health systems. Healthcare has always been very active in the search for new technologies that could be integrated to improve them. We observe that e-Health [1] is consolidating and providing a solid foundation for the more recent adoption of mobile health (M-Health) [2]. Parallel to this trend, we observe that the population tends to be concentrated in cities and that the new concept of smart cities is gaining popularity at an extremely rapid rate. A new concept of health (i.e. smart health) has emerged from the combination of these two trends."}, {"heading": "A. Contribution and Plan of the Article", "text": "In this article, we present the details of the data structures and databases of our Smart Health application, which is a route recommendation system. First, in Section II, we give an overview of the main players in the system. Second, in Section II-A and III, we describe the structures and data sets implemented in our system and explain how simulated data is generated using real medical statistics. Finally, in Section IV, we conclude the article. II. INTERNAL DETAILS OF OUR SYSTEMS In our Smart Health application, we collect data from various sources such as citizens \"data (e.g. their location, route preferences and medical data), real-time environmental information (e.g. air quality, weather information). In addition, we need to store the characteristics of the route in our database. In the next sections, we describe the internal structures and data management of our application."}, {"heading": "A. Data Structures", "text": "The proposed scheme requires the use of several matrices / tables in order to store the information required. Table I is an extract from the database in which the user ratings of the real routes used are stored. In order to calculate the recommendations for the top N routes (i.e. a set of the most promising routes for the citizen), the application applies a collaborative filtering technique [4] based on the search for the most similar / closest users, based on the information in Table I. Therefore, the system also recommends the routes that similar citizens have chosen with the highest values. In addition, the system uses a table containing information on the health status of citizens. Table II is an example of health information analysed by the system to avoid inappropriate recommendations. Information on the routes are also stored. Table III is an extract from the route database with information obtained from a real scenario in the city of Tarragona."}, {"heading": "III.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this article, we give an overview of the internal details of our Smart Health application. In addition, we explain the steps to generate a statistically based simulated data set with real medical data in order to further validate the system. Therefore, a formal presentation and definition of the proposal, details of the main actors, real-time data processing and communication with the Smart City, as well as validations, experiments and pilot tests are left to future work."}], "references": [{"title": "What is e-health?", "author": ["G.
