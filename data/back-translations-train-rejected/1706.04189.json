Since existing AUVs have limited battery capacity and restricted endurance, they should autonomously manage mission time and the resources to perform effective persistent deployment in longer missions. Task assignment requires making decisions subject to resource constraints, while tasks are assigned with costs and/or values that are budgeted in advance. Tasks are distributed in a particular operation zone and mapped by a waypoint covered network. Thus, design an efficient routing-task priority assign framework considering vehicle's availabilities and properties is essential for increasing mission productivity and on-time mission completion. This depends strongly on the order and priority of the tasks that are located between node-like waypoints in an operation network. On the other hand, autonomous operation of AUVs in an unfamiliar dynamic underwater and performing quick response to sudden environmental changes is a complicated process. Water current instabilities can deflect the vehicle to an undesired direction and perturb AUVs safety. The vehicle's robustness to strong environmental variations is extremely crucial for its safe and optimum operations in an uncertain and dynamic environment. To this end, the AUV needs to have a general overview of the environment in top level to perform an autonomous action selection (task selection) and a lower level local motion planner to operate successfully in dealing with continuously changing situations. This research deals with developing a novel reactive control architecture to provide a higher level of decision autonomy for the AUV operation that enables a single vehicle to accomplish multiple tasks in a single mission in the face of periodic disturbances in a turbulent and highly uncertain environment.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 00:15:48 GMT  (9229kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04189v1", "Thesis of PhD completed at Flinders University of South Australia, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Thesis of PhD completed at Flinders University of South Australia, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["somaiyeh mahmoud zadeh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04189"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.04189.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": ""}, {"heading": "Nomenclature xiiii", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "List of Abbreviations xvii", "text": "Certification error!

It must manage its resources effectively in order to perform effective and sustained deployment in longer missions without human interaction, and the tasks may have different characteristics, such as priority value, risk percentage and absolute completion time, that are known to the AUV in advance. Assuming that different tasks are distributed over a specific area of deployment, they can be mapped through a network in which their start and end points are represented as waypoints (an example map is shown in Figure 1.1).

The identical aspect of motion planning systems (in Definition-2) is that they are obliged to respond to a dynamic environment that is continuously changing in condition. A correct and realistic modeling of the environment, practical assumptions and the selection of an efficient search strategy are the most important steps of any motion planning approach. The first step towards achieving a satisfactory operation is to find an appropriate and efficient method of route planning. In general, the challenges associated with route planning can be viewed from two perspectives: firstly from the applied methods of motion planning (Section 2.4.3) and secondly from the competence of the techniques for real-time applications (Section 2.4.4). Accordingly, previous studies in this area are taken into account in the following disciplines."}, {"heading": "2.4.1 Path Construction Methods", "text": "There are popular techniques for linking the defined checkpoints, namely: Straight Line Method [56], which is not flexible enough to ensure a smooth transition in linking piece lines; Dubins categories of paths [57], which connect the connections so that the path becomes smoother in linking checkpoints; this method has attracted great interest in mobile robotic path planning and has been widely used in the last ten years [58-60]. Dubins-based methods are criticized for their high computing costs, which affect the real-time performance of the system, especially in the re-planning of paths [61].

Optimisation is a process defined on the basis of important criteria and requirements for each specific problem. As a rule, travel time and distance, minimum energy consumption or, in some cases, safety options are used as important criteria for assessing the optimum route [68, 69]. In recent years, many attempts have been made and various techniques have been proposed for the movement planning of autonomous robots.

The problem includes several objectives that should be met during the optimization process. One approach to solving multi-objective problems is the use of multi-objective optimization algorithms.
