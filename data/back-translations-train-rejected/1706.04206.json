There are limitations in this specification of classification categories. For example, guidelines may contain statements that relate to one condition, in another explanation, or sentences that are appropriate for different cases."}, {"heading": "Classification", "text": "Most of them have a migrant background and are therefore able to settle in another country where they are unable to integrate."}, {"heading": "Evaluation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Gold Standard Datasets", "text": "We use three medical guidelines to create Gold Standard Data Sets. They provide statements, tables, and numbers about hypertension, rhinosinusitis, and asthma. The creation of Gold Standard Data Sets is detailed below. Our data delivery process went like this: We started converting the guidelines from PDF or HTML format, using sentences only to address conversion errors. Tables and some numbers are a problem, and we just treat them as unstructured text. At this point, we are not dealing with the ambiguities introduced by this approach; we have plans to address them in future workflows. We used regular expressions as described above to select candidate sets from text files."}, {"heading": "Model Performance", "text": "Hypertension, asthma and rhinosinusitis guidelines and gold standard data sets were used to evaluate our model. As two of these commented corpora are new, our model establishes a baseline. The asthma corpus was previously examined by (Wenzina and Kaiser 2013). We extract candidate statements by applying the above regex tags. Hypertension, asthma and rhinosinusitis guidelines had 278, 172 and 761 candidate statements. By applying this filter subtask, we get rid of 38, 116 and 5 condition statements each from guidelines. We used Weka (Hall et al. 2009) classifiers to create our models. ZeroR, Nave Bayes, J48 and random forest classifiers were used in our project."}, {"heading": "Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We investigated the problem of automated extraction of conditional actions from clinical guidelines based on a commented corpus, p. 43. We proposed a simple supervised model that classifies statements based on combinations of some of the talking marks used as characteristics. We showed results from classifiers who use this model on three different annotated data sets that we have created. We publish these data sets for others to use. Obviously, this is a very preliminary work. Our work established foundations for automated extraction of conditional rules from medical guidelines, but their performance is still worse than a collection of manually created extraction rules. To fill this gap, we are currently expanding our model with semantic information along the lines (Kaiser, Seyfang, and Miksch 2011) and (Kaiser 2013). In addition, we are starting experiments with some discourse relationships - these are important, for example, in understanding lists and tables."}, {"heading": "American Medical Informatics Association 10(1):52\u201368.", "text": "[Serban et al. 2007] Serban, R.; ten Teije, A.; van Harmelen, F.; Marcos, M.; and Polo-Conde, C. 2007.
