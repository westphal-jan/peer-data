Given a set of grid cards to be merged, it can accomplish the merging of grid cards in several steps. It initially uses the method of pair-by-pair merging of grid cards to estimate the relative motion of grid card pairs. Due to the low overlapping percentage, an unreliable estimate of relative movements may occur for some grid card pairs. Therefore, the minimum set of reliable relative movements should be sampled and confirmed by other relative movements to eliminate unreliable relative movements. Then, the initial global movements can be estimated from the minimum of reliable relative movements. As the unreliable relative movements have been discarded, the motion averaging algorithm can be applied to the reserved relative movements to obtain precise global movements for the merging of grid cards and the proposed approach has been tested."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant numbers 61573273,
