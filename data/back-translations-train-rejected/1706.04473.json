Lower ID is found to be associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Snowdon et al., 1996; Engelman et al., 2010). ID has been used in two different versions: propositional idea density (PID) counts the expressed ideas and can be applied to any text while semantic idea density (SID) counts pre-defined information content units and is naturally more applicable to normative domains, such as picture description tasks. In this paper, we develop DEPID, a novel dependency-based method for computing PID, and its version DEPID-R that enables to exclude repeating ideas---a feature characteristic to AD speech. We conduct the first comparison of automatically extracted PID and SID in the diagnostic classification task on two different AD datasets covering both closed-topic and free-recall domains. While SID performs better on the normative dataset, adding PID leads to a small but significant improvement (+1.7 F-score). On the free-topic dataset, PID performs better than SID as expected (77.6 vs 72.3 in F-score) but adding the features derived from the word embedding clustering underlying the automatic SID increases the results considerably, leading to an F-score of 84.8.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 13:18:08 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04473v1", "CoNLL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "CoNLL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kairit sirts", "olivier piguet", "mark johnson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04473"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.04473.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Idea density for predicting Alzheimer\u2019s disease from transcribed speech", "authors": ["Kairit Sirts", "Olivier Piguet", "Mark Johnson"], "emails": ["kairit.sirts@ut.ee,", "olivier.piguet@sydney.edu.au", "mark.johnson@mq.edu.au"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 6.04 473v 1 [cs.C L] 14 Jun 2017What ideas or elementary predications are expressed in a statement or text?

In this work, they examined autobiographical essays written by the nuns decades ago in their youth, and the nuns were divided into three groups based on their ID score calculated from the essays, so that each group covered 33.3% of the entire range of ID values, with the lowest group being labeled as low ID and the middle and highest group as high ID. These groups were determined from a sample of 93 nuns. Associations between AD and ID were examined in a sample of 25 nuns who had died at the time of the study, 10 of whom the cause of death was labeled AD. The study found that most people with AD belonged to the low ID group, while most who did not develop AD were associated with the high ID group, suggesting that AD may be associated with the high ID group."}, {"heading": "2.1 Propositional and semantic idea density", "text": "Two different versions of ID have been developed over time, both derived from the basic sentence structure developed by Kintsch and Keenan (1973) to describe the semantic complexity of texts when reading experiments. Propositional idea density (PID), used in both the Nun study and the Study of Medical Students, is based on the counting of semantic sentences as defined by Turner and Greene (1977) and later refined by Chand et al. (2012). Three main types of predictions were described: 1) predictions based on verbal frames; 2) modifications that include all kinds of modifiers, e.g. adjective, adverbial, quantifying, qualifying, etc.; and 3) compounds that combine simple predictions into complex ones. For each prediction, a question can be formed with yes or no answer."}, {"heading": "2.2 Related work on AD using ID", "text": "Jarrold et al. (2010) used PID as one of many characteristics and stated it as significant. They achieved a classification accuracy of 73% on their dataset, which included brief structured clinical interviews, with their best model and feature set, which also included the feature PID. PID was also used by Roark et al. (2011) to detect mild cognitive impairment using a retelling dataset. However, they found no significant difference between the groups in terms of PID and therefore it was most likely filtered out by their feature selection process. In terms of SID, most previous work relied on manually defined ICUs (Ahmed et al., 2013b, a). Fraser et al. (2015) extracted binary and frequency-based ICU characteristics. They searched for words related to the ICU objects and looked at the sub-relationships in the dependency sections."}, {"heading": "3 Computation of PID", "text": "The instructions given by Turner and Greene (1977) on the counting of sentences presuppose an understanding of the semantic meaning of the text, while the raw text lacks the necessary semantic annotations. However, it was found that the sentences except a, an and the underlying sentence roughly correspond to certain POS tags. Snowdon et al. (1996) mention in particular that elementary sentences are expressed with verbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions. This observation is the basis of the CPIDR program (Brown et al., 2008), a tool for automatically calculating PID results from text. CPIDR first processes the text with a POS tagger, then counts all verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions and the coordination of conjunctions as propositions, and then applies a set of 37 rules to adjust the final counting of the propositions."}, {"heading": "3.1 DEPID\u2014dependency-based PID", "text": "We suggest that the dependency structure is better suited for PID calculation than the POS tag-counting approach used by the existing CPIDR program (Brown et al., 2008), because the dependency structure is more similar to the semantic sentence structure, see Table 1. We treat each dependency type as a separate feature and set the feature weights manually to one or zero, depending on whether or not this dependency relationship encodes a sentence. We make these decisions based on the dependency type descriptions in the Stanford Dependency Handbook (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). Dependency types with non-zero weights are calculated in Table 2. The PID is then calculated by adding up the points of these dependency relationships and normalizing them by the number of word marks. We call our dependency-based PID calculation method DEPID.We calculate the spearman correlations between chapters CDE69, PIDR, and examples in Chapter 27, PIDR."}, {"heading": "3.2 DEPID-R", "text": "It is well known that Alzheimer's language is generally fluent and grammatical, but to maintain fluidity, the deficiencies in semantic or episodic memory are compensated by empty words (Nicholas et al., 1985), such as repetitions, both at the word level and at the idea, sentence or narrative level. DEPID makes it easy to reconstruct repeated ideas in the narrative. We consider a sentence a repetition of an earlier idea when the tuples of the two sentences coincide. Another sentence, \"I had a happy life,\" contains three sentences: nsubj (I, HAVE), dobj (LIFE, HAVE) and amod (HAPPY, LEMMA). Another sentence, \"I had a very happy life.\" Later in the same story, PAVE adds only one sentence to the total number of predictions (VERY, HAPPY) and PAVID (HAPPY, LIE)."}, {"heading": "4 Computation of SID", "text": "Recently Yancheva and Rudzicz (2016) proposed a method for automatically calculating SID without the use of manually defined ICUs. Their method is based on clustering word embeddings of nouns and verbs found in the transcriptions, assuming that the embeddings of words referring to the same semantic unit are grouped together. They first perform a K-mean clustering based on word embeddings, then calculate for each word the mean distance of \u00b5cl and its standard deviation \u03c3cl. The mean distance is the average euclidean distance of all vectors assigned to a cluster from the center of that cluster. Finally, they calculate for each word the scaled distance as the z-score of the euclidean distance dE between the word embeddings and its standard deviation \u03c3cl. The mean distance is the average euclidean distance of all vectors assigned to the center of that clude this cluster as a cluded distance \u2212 the euclidean E = the standard distance."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Data", "text": "We are conducting experiments on two very different AD data sets.

In AD and psycholinguistic literature, PID was automatically calculated using CPIDR (Engelman et al., 2010; Ferguson et al., 2014; Bryant et al., 2013; Moe et al., 2016). We show that CPIDR has a number of deficiencies when applied to AD language, and propose a new PID calculation method, DEPID, which correlates more strongly with manual estimates of PID. We recommend AD researchers to use our automatic measurement DEPID-R, which also excludes repetitive ideas from the overall idea, instead of CPIDR. This is the first comparison between PID and SID and also the first computational study to evaluate the predictive models for Alzheimer's disease on two very different sets of data, which automatically generates the small data set SID as well as the small data set to improve the clinical data set."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research was supported by a Google Prize under the Natural Language Understanding Focused Program and the Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects grant program (project number DP160102156), and in part by funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) (APP1037746) and the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders Memory Program (CE11000102)."}], "references": [{"title": "Semantic processing in connected speech at a uniformly early stage of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "author": ["Samrah Ahmed", "Celeste A. de Jager", "Anne-Marie Haigh", "Peter Garrard."], "venue": "Neuropsychology 27(1):79\u201385.", "citeRegEx": "Ahmed et al\\.,? 2013a", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ahmed et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Connected speech as a marker of disease progression in autopsyproven Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "author": ["Samrah Ahmed", "Anne-Marie F.

We conduct the first comparison of automatically extracted PID and SID in the diagnostic classification task on two different AD datasets covering both closed-topic and free-recall domains.
