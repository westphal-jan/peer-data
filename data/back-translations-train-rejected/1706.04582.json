Therefore, developing and analyzing algorithms to find and use these properties is useful to improve the performance of modern solvers and our general understanding of SAT. In this work, we show that under the assumption that P is 6 = NP, there are easily identifiable sets of Boolean formulas where it is difficult to determine whether they have a backbone. We also show that under the same assumption, there are easily identifiable families of Boolean formulas with strong backdoors that are easy to find, for which it is difficult to determine whether they are satisfactory or not."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Many algorithms for the Boolean satisfaction problem exploit hidden structural properties of formulas to find a satisfactory mapping or to prove that there is no such mapping. These structural properties are called hidden because they are not explicitly included in the input formula. A natural question that then arises is the computational complexity associated with these hidden structures. In this paper, we focus on two hidden structures: backbone and strong backdoors [WGS03]. The complexity of decision problems related to backbones and backdoors has been studied by, among others, Kilby, Slaney, Thie Baux and Walsh [KSTW05] and Dilkina, Gomes and Sabharwal [DGS14]. Hemaspaandra and Narva'ez [HN17] show a separation between the complexity of the backbone search and the search for the values for which the backbone variables must be set as a formula."}, {"heading": "2 Definitions and Notations", "text": "For a Boolean formula F, we use V (F) to denote the set of variables of F. A partial assignment of F is a function aS: S \u2192 {True, False} that assigns Boolean values to the variables in a set of S V (F). For a Boolean value v \u00b2 {True, False} and a variable x \u00b2 V (F), the notation F [v / x] denotes the formula F after replacing and simplifying each occurrence of x with v. This extends to partial assignments by natural means. In theories about the hardness frequency of the sentences defined in this essay, we refer to input strings of no more than n. For an alphabet, on the other hand, we denote, in a slight notation misuse, the series of strings whose length is smaller or equal to n."}, {"heading": "3 Results on Backbones", "text": "It is not the case that we get involved in a way, in a way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way, and in a different way, and in a different way."}, {"heading": "4 Results on Backdoors to CNF Formulas", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "We have described easily identifiable families of Boolean formulas that provide difficult cases for backbone and backdoor decision problems, assuming that P 6 = NP. We did this by taking advantage of the fact that under such an assumption SAT-NP \u2212 P. In the specific case of backbone, our evidence depends on the fact that unsatisfactory formulas by definition have no backbone. We have also shown that if a problem in NP is often hard, then the families of the Boolean formulas we have described are often hard as well."}], "references": [{"title": "Tradeoffs in the complexity of backdoors to satisfiability: dynamic sub-solvers and learning during search", "author": ["B.
