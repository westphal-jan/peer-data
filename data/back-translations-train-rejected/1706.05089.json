Nevertheless, it is estimated that CLARIN has strong support from the linguistic community in Europe and has successfully implemented a number of projects in recent years demonstrating the value of academic and research infrastructure in its own right. However, despite the emphasis on users in the principles, user evaluation in CLARIN is rather minimal. In other words, infrastructure development is largely focused on planning and doing in the sense of PDCA5 and the review and action are highly limited. Recent publication (Eckart et al. 2015) reports on the user behaviour of VLO, one of the flagship services of CLARIN, but it does not provide any prior literature on the subject."}, {"heading": "2.2 Trend of transparent and measureable research", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before there is a result in which there is a result."}, {"heading": "3 Analysis between zero and one", "text": "CLARIN began tracking Piwik12 \"s web traffic on June 23, 2014, although there are some variations in launch dates for different websites, and the author opted for a baseline analysis period from August 1, 2014 to July 31, 2016, which gives us reasonable information about the monthly and annual trend within 24 months when the most recent critical development has taken place. As mentioned in the first section, CLARIN uses a wide range of web applications. In this article, we will examine VLO as one of the most prominent applications of all (Figure 2). There are good reasons for this decision: 1) A lot of time has been spent developing VLO as well as the underlying concepts and services, in particular CMDI (component MetaData Infrastructure) 13. 2) It is a symbol of CLARIN's pan-European collaboration, which has been created by people from many member states. 3) VLO contains an overwhelming number of records, currently on language and tools that could have a major impact on our society."}, {"heading": "3.1 Virtual Language Observatory overview", "text": "Recent years have shown that most of them are people who are not yet able to establish themselves in the EU, and that they are not yet able to establish themselves in the EU."}, {"heading": "3.2 Google Indexing", "text": "A final, but not final, reference to Figure 5 is Google indexing. In 2015, the author recommended to the VLO technical team to index VLO for Google in order to dramatically increase VLO web traffic. This proposal was accepted, followed by the creation of sitemaps by the Austrian Center for Digital Humanities (ACDH) in January 2016. Consequently, we submitted them to Google in February. The sitemaps allow the Google indexer to search the content of VLO and Google's VLO records, but the result was disappointing. Only 10,098 VLO records / pages were indexed out of 881,338 described in the sitemap. Overall, 37,172 of 881,334 records were indexed by 10 October 2016. It is also obvious that there is almost no impact on web traffic, hence invisible in Figure 5. The author experienced a four or five-fold increase in traffic per year in the case of archiving Europe."}, {"heading": "3.3 Profile of the users \u2013geographical distribution", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to go in search of a new home where they will be able to find a new home."}, {"heading": "3.4 Visit duration and visit frequency", "text": "Most VLO users spent less than 10 seconds (Figure 13), which can mean that they often leave a website without checking the content as soon as they consider it useless, perform a technical test or other similar reasons. However, one of the obvious reasons for this user allocation is the internal users of the CLARIN community. In order to detect the bias of internal users, the data was filtered by a CLARIN partner institution - the \u00d6AW (Austrian Academy of Sciences), under which the ACDH was founded (Figure 14). One of the obvious reasons for this user allocation are the internal users of the CLARIN community.

Taking Section 4.3 into account, we are introducing a hypothesis-making process here. The motives for changing user behavior are not yet known, but it seems that the summer of 2015 is a key moment in this clear cut. It is around the time of release of version 3.2 (early July) or less likely 3.3 (late September). It is also worth remembering that there is an overall falling trend in unique visitors. Although not as drastic, it corresponds to the decline in downloads. With our limited information, it is not easy to identify the exact cause of this problem, but the release reports of the VLO developers may contain some clues, although two releases are rather minor updates."}, {"heading": "4 Playing a fair game? \u2013methodological issues of web analytics", "text": "This section discusses the procedural and methodological aspects of web analysis in general. It is intended to focus on the \"science of our experience\" of analyses, hypotheses and interpretations of web traffic, which remains relatively untouched in studies of web analytics.The section is divided into two parts: the first part attempts to open and analyze the black box of web analysis, the second part discusses the techniques and tips used for analysis to document the research experience and share it with other analysts of the future."}, {"heading": "4.1 Opening the black box", "text": "It is also important to know whether the statistics of different websites are comparable."}, {"heading": "4.2 Tips for data analysis", "text": "Although some may need a little training, Piwik is generally an intuitive and user-friendly tool, capable of recording and generating many different statistics on website usage. At the same time, it also seems true that many analysts use only the most basic (and preset) functionality without bothering to consider various aspects of statistics, and therefore do not achieve their full potential. As a result, the data is sometimes neither adequately interpreted nor presented to stakeholders, which would also be a consequence of the current research environment in which time may not be invested enough for marketing and business analysis. In this section, some tips for web analytics are documented in our analysis in Section 3. The concept of open evaluation that this paper proposes is a small attempt to draw attention to this issue and break the barrier of access to the accumulated experience of web analysis. In addition, a broad category of open science and innovation also falls within the framework of this idea, in order to encourage knowledge transfer and exchange (although Google's use of the Analytics Documentation is similar to the Documentation of Democracy)."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Segmentation", "text": "Standard statistics are a good way to know the general trend, but they should not be interpreted without careful consideration of smaller segments. As repeatedly stated in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, user profiles and behaviors are different in different user groups. Thanks to Piwik's faceting feature, we can easily specify specific groups based on a variety of criteria and regular expressions, including IP address (Figure 27). As seen in Section 4.1, we are even able to track the behavior of a unique user. For example, it is more than easy to identify access from the CLARIN community to compare CLARIN users with outsiders as far as IP addresses are provided. Such a study is rare in the Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage. Taking segmentation into account, the chronological analysis of segments has much potential for marketing analysis. Section 3 taught us the ability to monitor all segments to track the change in the situation over time (as \"evolution\")."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Advanced Piwik and external applications", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of us are able to abide by the rules that we have set ourselves in order to comply with them.

(...)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Myth or truth? \u2013intuition, interpretation, and induction", "text": "In Section 3, the author deliberately avoided providing the last and only interpretation of the data. Rather, he subtly packs a series of steps that point to the process of data analysis and interpretation. It is true that we have common sense or intuitive interpretation when we first look at a data set, based on previous experience, so we have a mutual understanding of the \"vague probability,\" in our case, of web traffic. The problem is that the evidence of such interpretation is often lacking and the process of induction is not documented. Thus, we mentioned Wynne (2015b) in the introduction. To address this problem, one can find many traces of \"analysis / research documentation.\" Section 3.1 explained why weekends are excluded from the graphics, while Section 3.2 examined the process and effects of Google indexing. Section 3.3 presented a potential pitfall pit of data visualization and interpretation. Careful investigation is necessary to avoid being guided by a visualization or misinterpretation."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Future Work", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "5.2 Challenges for CLARIN\u2019s infinity and beyond \u2013A little Kaizen", "text": "This article presented a minimum amount of user analysis that attempts to address the problems of the user-oriented development method with respect to web traffic. It is not possible to use readily available statistics to increase the marketing value of the VLO. Thus, the usefulness and potential of Pihttwik have been successfully demonstrated. Furthermore, the author intentionally documented the process of data analysis and interpretation in the name of research reusability and reproducibility. Although such a documentation aspect of web analysis has made this paper rather eloquent, it is hoped that other researchers would benefit from it in the future. The current problem of the technical and business development of CLARIN is the absence of a simple PDCA methodology and the documentation of visions and business strategies. As far as the author recognizes, the check is preliminary conducted through internal testing and feedback, focusing on bug fixing and self-contained improvements."}], "references": [{"title": "Influence of Interface Design on User Behaviour in the VLO", "author": ["Eckart", "Helwig", "Goosen 2015] T.
