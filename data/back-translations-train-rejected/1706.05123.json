Discovering the relationships, or namely compact laws, in a data set is of great interest in many fields, such as physics, chemistry, and finance. While data discovery has made great progress in practice thanks to the success of machine learning in recent years, the development of analytical approaches in finding the theory behind the data is relatively slow. In this paper, we develop an innovative approach in discovering compact laws from a data set. By proposing a novel algebraic equation formulation, we convert the problem of deriving meaning from data into formulating a linear algebra model and searching for relationships that fit the data. Rigorous proof is presented in validating the approach. The algebraic formulation allows the search of equation candidates in an explicit mathematical manner. Searching algorithms are also proposed for finding the governing equations with improved efficiency. For a certain type of compact theory, our approach assures convergence and the discovery is computationally efficient and mathematically precise.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 01:13:04 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05123v1", "16 pages, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["wenqing xu", "mark stalzer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.05123"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.05123.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["wxu@caltech.edu", "stalzer@caltech.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 170 6.05 123v 1 [cs.L G] 16 Jun 20"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it will be so far, until it is so far, until it is so far."}, {"heading": "2 Algebraic Formulation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Virtual Experiment Setup", "text": "Suppose we have a data set, i.e. the inputs and outputs of a certain number of experiments, but we do not know what the inputs and outputs are.

exist compact and consistent relationships between input and output parameters. Discovering the relationships, or namely compact laws, in a data set is of great interest in many fields, such as physics, chemistry, and finance. While data discovery has made great progress in practice thanks to the success of machine learning in recent years, the development of analytical approaches in finding the theory behind the data is relatively slow. In this paper, we develop an innovative approach in discovering compact laws from a data set. By proposing a novel algebraic equation formulation, we convert the problem of deriving meaning from data into formulating a linear algebra model and searching for relationships that fit the data. Rigorous proof is presented in validating the approach. The algebraic formulation allows the search of equation candidates in an explicit mathematical manner. Searching algorithms are also proposed for finding the governing equations with improved efficiency. For a certain type of compact theory, our approach assures convergence and the discovery is computationally efficient and mathematically precise. 2 Wenqing (William) Xu", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
