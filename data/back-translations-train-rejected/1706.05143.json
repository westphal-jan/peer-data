It has recently gained more attention due to the prominence and influence of social networks and the ability to influence large groups through coordinated information operations. The potential for using large-scale influence campaigns has already been realized, especially during the 2016 US election or the previous Bexit vote. However, the influence of political (twitter) bots has been observed for years in several constituencies around the world, including Turkey, Mexico and India. During the 2014 elections in India, Narendra Modi reached nearly 4 million Twitter followers. However, when Time began awarding Twitter its Person of the Year award, local media soon discovered a pattern. Thousands of Modi's followers tweeted the same phrase: \"I think Narendra Modi should periodically # TIMEPOY.\""}, {"heading": "II. A BRIEF HISTORY OF BOTS", "text": "According to Botnets: The Killer Web Applications [25], \"bots were originally developed as virtual individuals who could sit on an IRC channel and do things for their owner while the owner was busy elsewhere.\" The first IRC bot called GM was developed in 1989, as a benevolent bot that would play a Hunt the Wumpus game with IRC users. A decade later, the first botnets became known. A botnet is a potentially large collection of bots that communicate with each other or with a single bottler. Pretty Park was first seen in March 1999 and introduced many of the features used more than a decade after its launch, with the ability to report computer specifications, search email addresses, retrieve passwords, update its functionality, transfer files, redirect traffic, conduct DoS attacks, and communicate with an IRC server. SubSeven (May 1999) was the first remote-controlled malware (Boombie)."}, {"heading": "III.

DEEP LEARNING", "text": "The scary part of this story is that there is no evidence that today's influence campaigns are taking advantage of rapidly advancing machine learning or AI technologies, and the level of research into generating signals that mimic human behavior, as well as complex, human-interacting, deep neural network architectures that digest, understand, and continually update, has stagnated. As recently as 2012, Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton published ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks [12], which represented a groundbreaking leap in image recognition using a neural network of 60 million parameters and 500,000 neurons. Since then, performance has steadily improved, using increasingly complex networks and ever-larger datasets. In 2015, MSRA won the ImageNet challenge with a network of 154 layers. Google admitted to use a database of 500 million facial images to create megaface facial recognition."}, {"heading": "A. Reinforcement Learning", "text": "The profound learning improvements highlighted above are monitored techniques based on vast amounts of marked data (text, image, speech, or video), but significant advances have been made in unsupervised or semi-supervised machine learning. Techniques that use reinforcement learning accept targeted responses and learn to optimize their decisions in complex environments. Probably the most recent success reported in this direction is the ability of a Google DeepMind AlphaGo system to beat a 9-Dan pro with no handicaps. Initially, the system was developed with supervised learning from human play, but then it was optimized through reinforcement learning by adjusting it to play against other instances on its own. Doubling this success does not seem very easy. Facebook's Darkforest system has not defeated a professional human go player. Additionally, Dwango and the University of Tokyo developed DeepZenGo, which has not yet demonstrated dominance over leading human players."}, {"heading": "B. Generative Adversarial Networks", "text": "A new deep-learning architecture, known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [20], has the potential to improve detection in multiple areas and simultaneously deliver systems that can generate non-human outputs that resemble human characteristics. GANs are made up of two multi-layered perceptrons G and D. The G = G (z; \u03b8g) network incorporates input parameters and maps into the data space. D = D (x; \u03b8d) network takes parameters and input from the data space and outputs a single scalar. D is trained to maximize the likelihood of matching the correct designation both to training examples and to samples from G. At the same time, G is trained to minimize log data (1 \u2212 D (G (z))) or alternatively to maximize logD (G (z)). While the differentiating network D is learned, the G network is improved to produce data that resembles the originally labeled data, and maximizes its probability distribution [22]."}, {"heading": "VI. MULTIMODAL PERSONAS & SCARY BOTS", "text": "Deep neural networks are used in just about every human speech technology to achieve state-of-the-art recognition technology. Accompanying generative networks will (or is) possible to generate output that mimics human behavior, as well as human environments. [21] Thus, a Montreal-based company Lyrebird [15] recently demonstrated the ability to take each user's voice and create a voice bot that speaks in a similar way to the given voice. Today, most human ears are still able to detect anomalies with the bot voice that separates them from the real human voice, but it is eerily close. It will only get better with more collected data and a larger neural network. Google DeepMind has also produced a similar ability called WaveNet [16]. It is becoming commonplace for Hollywood movies to modify actors \"facial gestures after shooting is complete, and without the participation of the actual actors. It can be done synthetically, and cinema-goers have no idea what changes have been made."}], "references": [{"title": "Building the Brain: A Survey of Artificial Intelligence, Harvard University Extension School, CSCI", "author": ["G.
