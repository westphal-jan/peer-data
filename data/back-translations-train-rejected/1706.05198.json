Our main motivation is the application to the minimax game search, which has been a major topic of interest in artificial intelligence. In this paper we introduce an abstract setting to clearly describe the essential properties of the problem. While previous work only considered a two-move game tree search problem, our abstract setting can be applied to the general minimax games where the depth can be non-uniform and arbitrary, and transpositions are allowed. We introduce a new algorithm (LUCB-micro) for the abstract setting, and give its lower and upper sample complexity results. Our bounds recover some previous results, which were only available in more limited settings, while they also shed further light on how the structure of minimax problems influence sample complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 09:51:36 GMT  (143kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05198v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 19 Jun 2017 05:47:31 GMT  (143kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05198v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["ruitong huang", "mohammad m ajallooeian", "csaba szepesv\\'ari", "martin m\\\"uller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.05198"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.05198.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Structured Best Arm Identification with Fixed Confidence", "authors": ["Ruitong Huang", "Mohammad M.

Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "The gap between the lower limit and the upper limit is a considerable gap between the lower limit and the upper limit. In addition to the gaps that already exist in the area of multi-armed bandits, which have already been mentioned, there is a considerable gap: in particular, it is not difficult to show that in regular Minimax wild trees with a fixed branching factor of L and D, the upper limit has scales of L and D, while the lower limit has scales of L. One potential is to improve the lower limit in such a way that one can take into account adversarial disturbances in the values assigned to the leaf nodes: that is, after the algorithm is set, an opponent can disrupt the values of the lower limit in order to maximize the lower limit. Simchowitz et al. (2017) introduces an interesting technique for detecting lower limits of this form and they demonstrate non-trivial improvements in the multi-armed bandit conversion."}, {"heading": "A.

We also provide a high-probability, instance-dependent upper bound on algorithm\u2019s sample complexity (i.e., on the number of observations the algorithm takes). As we discuss, while this bound meets the general characteristics of existing bounds, it fails to reproduce the corresponding result of Garivier et al. (2016a). To the best of authors\u2019 knowledge, the only comparable algorithm to study best arm identification in a full-length minimax tree search setting (which was the motivating example of our work) is FindTopWinner by Teraoka et al.

(2002) or Garivier et al.

This is then specialized to the minimax game search setting (Section 4), where we show the crucial role of what we call proof sets, which are somewhat reminiscent of the so-called conspiracy sets from adversarial search (McAllester, 1988). Our lower bound matches that of Garivier et al. (2016a) in the case of two-move alternating problems.

Next, we consider the minimax setting (Section 6). First, we show that the regularity assumptions made for the abstract setting are met in this case. We also show how to efficiently compute the choices that LUCB-micro makes using a \u201cmin-max\u201d algorithm.
