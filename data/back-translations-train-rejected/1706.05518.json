With the technology embedded in all organizations and facilities, and the application of the Smart-ness concept to accommodate the needs of travelers before, during and after their trip, the destination could increase its competitiveness (Buhalis and Amaranggana 2013). Many tourism applications offer a personalized tourist agenda with the list of recommended activities for the user (Garcia et al. 2009; Vansteenwegen et al. 2011; Refanidis et al. 2014). In most cases, applications are returned a tourist route or agenda indicating the most convenient order for the user to realize the activities and additionally track the path between activities. In other cases, tools provide a dynamic interaction that allows the user to interact with such an agenda by adding or modifying these activities or changing their activities."}, {"heading": "Problem description", "text": "In this section, we describe the tourism problem that needs to be solved with a planner and a CSP solution. The problem is inspired by the information contained in the problem definition: (a) a set of recommended points of interest (POIs) for the respective tourist; we assume the existence of a recommendation system (RS) that returns to the user a set of preferred POIs according to his wishes; (b) the preferences of the tourist in terms of travel style and transport model; and (c) contextual information such as the location or hours of tourist attractions. First, the user enters the basic details of the route: the date of the visit, the start and end point, the start and end time, the time interval reserved for lunch, and the type of transport he prefers."}, {"heading": "Problem formulation", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world, in which they are able, in which they are able to move, and in which they are able to change the world."}, {"heading": "Penalties", "text": "In fact, it is a matter of a way in which most people are able, in which they are able to decide whether they are able to move, or whether they are able to move.

As these are penalties, a plan better fulfills the preferences of the user if the values of the penalties are lower; therefore, the metrics must be minimized. Generally, these metrics consist of the addition of the four penalties defined above. That is, all factors are taken into account equally. \u2022 M1: Benefits per POI: These metrics use the first defined unvisited POIs penalty PU1, therefore, emphasis is placed on how many high-benefit POIs are visited. A value is taken at intervals [0.4].M1 + PU1 + Pjourney + P # Visits temporally + PoccupExamples, provided that the user prefers few visits and a high time occupation in the plan, these metrics would include the following values for each plan in Figure 1: 1.09, 1.54, 1.18 and 1.28. This means that the best plan according to these metrics would be the first plan and the second plan, which would be the second worst one that would not be visited."}, {"heading": "PDDL encoding", "text": "This section describes the planning formulation of the tourism problem described in the previous section. We will specify the problem using PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language), the standard language for encoding planning problems. The features required to define the tourism problem in PDDL are: (1) timing and management of permanent actions (e.g. length of visit, duration of transport, etc.); (2) ability to argue with time restrictions (e.g. scheduling of activities within the opening hours of places, scheduling of the tour within the available time window of the tourist, etc.); and (3) ability to argue with tourist preferences (e.g. selecting the user's preferred activities for planning the tour). In particular, in addition to durable actions introduced in PDDL 2.1 (Fox and Long 2003), we also need the following features: \u2022 duration inequality to define the duration of an action as value within an interval."}, {"heading": "Variables", "text": "The problem variables are specified by predicates and functions. A visit to a POI is defined by: \u2022 The interval duration of a visit to a POI p is defined by the functions (min. duration of visit? p) and (max. duration of visit? p). They are assigned the values dminp and dmaxp of the corresponding POI p in list V. \u2022 The opening and closing time of a POI p is specified by a time-initial literal: (when opening (open p)) and (when close (not (open p))), where open and close are defined in H. The time for switching from one place p to another place q is defined by the function (local time p q), which specifies the time specified in T for switching from p to q. We note that T calculates the travel time between the POIs of V according to the transport mode specified by the user."}, {"heading": "Actions", "text": "We define three types of actions in the tourism problem: Move, Visit and Eat. The action to get from one place to another is shown in Figure 2. The parameters are the initial location? x, the user and the destination? z. The duration of the action is set to the time specified in T. The prerequisites for this action are: (1) the user is at the place? x and (2) the free time is greater than the duration of the move. The effects of the action say that (1) the user is no longer at the initial location, (2) the user is at the new location at the end of the action and (3) the free time and time spent on the move are modified according to the duration of the move. The action to visit a POI is shown in Figure 3. The parameters are to visit the POI? x and the user? y."}, {"heading": "Goal and optimization function", "text": "We define two different types of goals: \u2022 Hard goals, which represent the realization of an action that the user has specified as mandatory (e.g. the location that the user has specified as the final destination: (person at the destination)). \u2022 Soft goals or preferences that we want to fulfill in order to create a good plan, but that do not need to be achieved for the plan to be correct (Gerevini et al. 2009). We award penalties for violated preferences. The goal is to find a plan that achieves all hard goals and minimizes the overall penalty for dissatisfied preferences. For example, the specification of PU1 metric (see sections Penalties and Preferences) in PDDL is expressed as follows: (: Metric Minimization (+ PU1 Pjourney P # visits Poccup)))))) (1) PU1. The specification of PU1 requires the definition of a preference for each POI in V; e.g. (Preference 1 (UU1 visit location 1 Ujourney P # visits Poccup)))))) (PU1 (Preference Time (2) (Preference Time = 2) (2) (2) (UPUP1) (Preference Time = 2) (1) (28th = 2)."}, {"heading": "CSP model", "text": "In this section, the specification of the tourist problem Pu = < R, V, H, T > is described as CSP."}, {"heading": "Constraints", "text": "In this section, we explain the restrictions that need to be specified in order to solve the tourism problem correctly. (Among the places recommended by the RS, not all of them are included in the agenda, because several time restrictions need to be observed.) We define an array P of the | V | 3 elements that are used to capture the places included in the tourist route. (The variables take a value in 0, 1} to determine whether the respective place is a visit to the route or not. The three additional variables defined in P represent the original location of the user (always set to 1), the restaurant (this variable corresponds to 1 when the user has selected a lunch) and the destination (always set to 1). For the first plan of Figure 1, and provided that | V = 6, the final array P = < Orig, V is2, V is3, V is5, V is6, is6, Rest, where variable are explained."}, {"heading": "Optimization function", "text": "The limitations specified in the previous section allow the CSP solver to obtain a valid plan. As our goal is to obtain a high-quality plan that matches the preferences of the user, some other factors must be taken into account. In this case, we have implemented all the metrics defined in the Metrics section using the variables defined above. For example, the Pjourney penalty can be formalized as follows: Pjourney = \u2211 i, j, k duri, j \u0445 mijktotal time (4), where duri, j is the duration of the travel time from i to j, as defined in T."}, {"heading": "Solution", "text": "A CSP solution is a pair of forms (Starti, Finishi) for the lunch action and for each recommended visit i. If the POI is included in the plan, Starti and Finishi specify the start and finish time of the visit, otherwise these values are set to 0. Therefore, all visits with values greater than 0 would be included in Starti and Finishi. On the other hand, any travel action to be recorded would be derived from the gaps between visits. The following table represents the CSP output from the first plan in Figure 1. In this case, visits V 2 and V 3 and the restaurant would be included in the plan and, for example, the travel action from the starting point to the first visit (V 2) would begin at a time of 0 with a duration of 20.V1 V2 V4 V5 R Start 320 20 0 0 0 0 180 end 570 170 0 0 0 300."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "This chapter describes the results of solving the problem with PDDL encoding and CSPencoding. According to the characteristics required to formulate the PDDL problem, we need a planner to handle the problem. A few automated planners are able to do this, such as MIPSXXL (Edelkamp, Jabbar, and Nacional 2006), SGPLAN5 (Chen, Wah, and Hsu 2005), or OPTIC (Benton, Coles, and Coles 2012). We chose OPTIC because it is not fixed and manages other helpful functionalities. OPTIC is a relaxed plan that adapts to the time settings."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "This article describes the tourism problem of creating a personalized tourism agenda that, in addition to the usual limitations such as maximizing user satisfaction with visits, also takes into account other user preferences related to travel style.
