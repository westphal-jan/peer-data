Specifically,... it may be within current computer and algorithmic systems to infer the Maxwell equations directly from the data given the knowledge of vector computation.This short work reports on the recent progress towards this goal in the broader context of combinatorics and there are applications beyond science. The overall goal is to develop methods that can quickly discover compact theories of data. Most data-intensive analysis techniques are based on machine learning or statistics. They are very useful, but do not lead to deep understanding or knowledge.Abstractedly, one considers an alphabet A = [A, B, C,...] where each letter can appear once in a sentence and the length of the alphabet is n. This is a simple combinatory enumeration v that does not lead to deep understanding or understanding."}, {"heading": "2 Algorithm", "text": "The algorithm enumerates phrases of increasing complexity q, whereby q is the sum of the letters q = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ="}, {"heading": "3 Motivation", "text": "The underlying motivation was described in the introduction, namely the rediscovery of the Maxwell equations. Here is the decoder ring. The Maxwell equations, up to the constants, are [C], [D], the E, B divergence equations, both of complexity 4; and the field coupling equations of [G, F] and [H, E], of complexity 11. Also the fields of light equations are [I, K] and [J, L], each of complexity 14 [4]. The complexity metric is only 1 + the number of space-time derivatives. There are many possibilities for future development, as briefly listed below. \u2022 Validation and constant determination. Basic constants such as c were known at the time of Maxwell. However, constants can be determined automatically via linear algebra, in this case. \u2022 Larger data and parallelism."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research is supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through Grant GBMF4915 to the Caltech Center for Data-Driven Discovery (A) (A) (D) (D) (D) (D)) (Discussions with Mr. William Xu of Caltech Math / Computer Science) were \"very helpful.\" The author is Prof. S.
