Dominant PointsF. Attneave observation [25] on information about shape and general structure of any curve lies on those points with high curvature. Since then dominant points are considered as one of the significant candidates of object boundary detection because they keep important feature information about object contours. There are number of approaches used by different researchers to efficiently, successfully capture dominant points according to Attneave's careful observation.We, Wen-Yen [18], A digital curve C consist of n subsequent points and can be written as follows -C = {i, i = 2, -- i"}], "references": [{"title": "A Novel Distributed Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization.", "author": ["Li", "Yangyang"], "venue": "Journal of Optimization", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2017}, {"title": "Object tracking benchmark.", "author": ["Wu", "Yi", "Jongwoo Lim", "Ming-Hsuan Yang"], "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2015}, {"title": "High-speed tracking with kernelized correlation filters.", "author": ["Henriques", "Jo\u00e3o F"], "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Fast Moving Object Tracking Algorithm based on Hybrid Quantum PSO.\" target", "author": ["Chen", "Jinyin", "Yi Zhen", "Dongyong Yang"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Multi-object tracking using particle swarm optimization on target interactions.\" Advances in Heuristic Signal Processing and Applications", "author": ["Kwolek", "Bogdan"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2013}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 4, "context": "Bogdan Kwolek [5] represent an approach where object is represented by image template , after constructing a covariance matrix based on that, by using similarity measure PSO will keep track of the difference appeared during movement of the object with target template.", "startOffset": 14, "endOffset": 17}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "Above we discussed all those considerable contribution towards object tracking using PSO in various ways, but there are significantly less work has been done in object tracking using Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO), Though this QPSO concept is not very old[17] developed by Sun, Jun, Bin Feng, and Wenbo Xu but still a decade gone, while we found Chen, Jinyin, Yi Zhen, and Dongyong Yang work [4] on object tracking but other than that not much work to mention.", "startOffset": 404, "endOffset": 407}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "Brown[4] uses dominant point for boundary contour and propose a time propagation method of those dominant points so that it can effectively detect deformation of object and track.", "startOffset": 5, "endOffset": 8}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "K , u , \u03c6 are random number distributed uniformly over the range [0,1].", "startOffset": 65, "endOffset": 70}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "\uf0b7 \u03c6 ,\u03b2, u , k values initialization \u2013earlier we define the meaning of this termson equation [4-6], all those variables values are randomly distributed in range [0-1].", "startOffset": 92, "endOffset": 97}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "\uf0b7 \u03c6 ,\u03b2, u , k values initialization \u2013earlier we define the meaning of this termson equation [4-6], all those variables values are randomly distributed in range [0-1].", "startOffset": 92, "endOffset": 97}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "\uf0b7 \u03c6 ,\u03b2, u , k values initialization \u2013earlier we define the meaning of this termson equation [4-6], all those variables values are randomly distributed in range [0-1].", "startOffset": 160, "endOffset": 165}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "All the experimental dataset has been taken form benchmark library created by Yi Wu, Member, IEEE, Jongwoo Lim, Member, IEEE, and Ming-Hsuan Yang, Senior Member, IEEE[1] work which will be available on http://pami.", "startOffset": 166, "endOffset": 169}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "[1].", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 3}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": "[2].", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 3}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "[3].", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 3}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "[4].", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 3}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "[5].", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 3}], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "In Computer Vision domain, moving Object Tracking considered as one of the toughest problem.
