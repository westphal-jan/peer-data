This is especially true when designing this system for more than $\\mathbf{236~million}$ daily active users. Ranking strategy, the key module of the recommender system, needs to be precise, accurate, and responsive for estimating customers' intents. We propose a dynamic ranking paradigm, named as DNN-MAB, that is composed of a pairwise deep neural network (DNN) $\\mathit{pre}$-ranker connecting a revised multi-armed bandit (MAB) dynamic $\\mathit{post}$-ranker. By taking into account of explicit and implicit user feedbacks such as impressions, clicks, conversions, etc. DNN-MAB is able to adjust DNN $\\mathit{pre}$-ranking scores to assist customers locating items they are interested in most so that they can converge quickly and frequently. To the best of our knowledge, frameworks like DNN-MAB have not been discussed in the previous literature to either E-Commerce or machine learning audiences. In practice, DNN-MAB has been deployed to production and it easily outperforms against other state-of-the-art models by significantly lifting the gross merchandise volume (GMV) which is the objective metrics at JD.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 02:33:53 GMT  (7227kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03993v1", "7 pages, 7 figures, accepted by 'IJCAI-17 Workshop AI Applications in E-Commerce'"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 7 figures, accepted by 'IJCAI-17 Workshop AI Applications in E-Commerce'", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["yan yan", "wentao guo", "meng zhao", "jinghe hu", "weipeng p yan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.03993"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.03993.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Optimizing Gross Merchandise Volume via DNN-MAB Dynamic Ranking Paradigm", "authors": ["Wentao Guo", "Meng Zhao", "Jinghe Hu", "Weipeng P.

After the system specifies the identities of the users, the recommender makes a search request to the user database and the item database for further information relating to user profiles such as gender, geo-location, purchase history, price sensitivity, etc. This information, combined with the items that users have recently clicked on or placed in the shopping basket, is collected and serves as an input of the retrieval system. Next, the retrieval system selects a large pool of candidate items that are related to the input item.

It splits the real data streams into 10 groups, with each of these groups receiving about 8% of total traffic and the remaining 20% held by the control group.

DNN-rt-ft is to leverage the DNN pre-ranking, considering both the feedback from offline users and online surfing and click signals as characteristics for training a nearline model that is only better than models that take offline signals. On average, we see that DNN-MAB's daily GMV has increased 16.69% via DNN-rt-ft. Any performance gains greater than 1.0% over 7 days are considered statistically significant in the real production system. DNN-MAB paradigm has clearly demonstrated its superiority over the current DNN rt-ft ranking strategy. To emphasize the importance of parameter initialization and feedback revision in Thompson-sampling, we also report on DNN + NormalThompson in Tab.2. Due to the spatial limitation of DNN-rt-ft ranking strategy, we do not simply go to DNN's final page, but rather to the DNN's very detailed DNB page."}, {"heading": "3.4 System specifications", "text": "Our current DNN-MAB ranking system is maintained by hundreds of Linux servers1, the qps (query per second) is 321We have not been able to release this information about the exact number of operating servers due to company confidentiality on average (peak at 52), and the latency of the overall recommendation at the end of the response time is within 50.0 milli-seconds (both on-demand and ranking phases)."}, {"heading": "4 RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Recommender system", "text": "The recommendation system is the key to the success of e-commerce websites and other indexing service providers such as Alibaba, Ebay, Google, Baidu, Youtube, etc. Efforts by various parties to design recommendation systems include [Linden et al., 2003; Davidson et al., 2010; Schafer et al., 2001; Sarwar et al., 2000]. Generally, there are two workflows in the recommendation system: content-based approaches and item-based approaches represent users and items as a huge M by N matrix and focus on learning the underlying relationships between items. Works of item-based approaches such as [Sarwar et al., 2001; Rendle et al., 2010] have all had tremendous success.

Thompson samples taken from [Thompson, 1933], despite their simplicity in terms of production performance [Tang et al., 2013; Chapelle and Li, 2011] have proven to be quite efficient and surprisingly easy to implement. Further work on Thompson sample models includes [Scott, 2010]."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSION", "text": "We have proposed a dynamic ranking paradigm called DNNMAB, consisting of Learning-to-Rank DNN Preranker and Revised-Thompson Post-Ranker. This effective ranking paradigm takes into account both the user and the item information, so that the DNN could achieve decent static ranking performance. In the meantime, the Revised-Thompson sample has been able to adjust the pre-rankings, which further increase the objective ratios. To our knowledge, such a ranking framework has not been discussed in previous research. Real production tests show that both GMVs and DCGs have improved significantly. However, for the sake of simplicity, we have not paid too much attention to the positioning distortion, which is an important factor influencing ranking performance [Radlinski et al., 2008] in the Learning-to-Rank DNN Pre-Ranker, which would bring the listing problem into some scalability."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Dali Yang, Huisi Ou, Sulong Xu, Jincheng Wang, Lu Bai, Lixing Bo and anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

This is especially true when designing this system for more than 236 million active users. Ranking strategy, the key module of the recommender system, needs to be precise, accurate, and responsive for estimating customers\u2019 intents. We propose a dynamic ranking paradigm, named as DNNMAB, that is composed of a pairwise deep neural network (DNN) pre-ranker connecting a revised multi-armed bandit (MAB) dynamic post-ranker. By taking into account of explicit and implicit user feedbacks such as impressions, clicks, conversions, etc. DNN-MAB is able to adjust DNN preranking scores to assist customers locating items they are interested in most so that they can converge quickly and frequently. To the best of our knowledge, frameworks like DNN-MAB have not been discussed in the previous literature to either E-Commerce or machine learning audiences. In practice, DNN-MAB has been deployed to production and it easily outperforms against other stateof-the-art models by significantly lifting the gross merchandise volume (GMV) which is the objective metrics at JD.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
