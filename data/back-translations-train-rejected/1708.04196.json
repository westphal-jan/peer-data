Since the introduction of the Bike-Share system, much research has been done on various aspects of these systems, some of which are descriptive, mining the data to gain a better understanding of the operations, others are prescriptive and suggest ways to improve the operations, the most commonly used prediction model relates to balancing. Various studies have focused on mathematical optimization and have addressed the problem of realignment by developing mathematical models for the repositioning of bikes in the system (6,10-16).A large part of the descriptive models develops prediction models for the departure and arrival rates, and bicycle availability.

It offers various membership packages that vary by membership period. The first 30 minutes of each trip are free for members, and additional surpluses will follow for every 30 minutes.Capital Bikeshare was the largest bike share system in North America until May 2013. It is currently the fourth largest in North America. As of July 2016, Capital Bikeshare had 3,050 bikes and 391 stations. In the presence of these many stations, analyzing and visualizing each station for itself is impractical. To better visualize the bikeshare data, the stations should be aggregated, the stations aggregated based on similarity and similarity."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "In this paper, two different visualizations and clusters of the bike share data are offered: one is the hourly pick-up / drop-off trends (profiles) of the stations; the other is based on the imbalance of the individual stations; the stations are grouped according to their general profile patterns to achieve the first goal of showing the pick-up / drop-off trends of the stations; and for the second goal, the stations are categorized by their ADMS and ADME for the day. ADMS and ADME will be defined in more detail later in this methodology section."}, {"heading": "Clustering Methodology for Visualizing Daily Temporal Trends of Stations", "text": "Clustering is based on the temporal (hourly) profile of the percentage of pickups / drop-offs during different hours of the day. We chose the percentage of pickups / drop-offs instead of the number of pickups / drop-offs because different stations have different capacities. This clustering aims to group the stations that have similar trends together and not those of similar size. The clustering methodology has five main steps: 1) data pickups; 2) the aggregation of data; 3) the normalization of pickups and drop-offs of stations; 4) the removal of stations with atypical behaviors; 5) the identification of an appropriate number of clusters in the K-Means. Each step is described in more detail below. Data purification is an intrinsic part of any data analysis. Here, we purify data that causes both the removal of data errors and the removal of anomalous data points (37). The latter is especially important when the purpose of data analysis is."}, {"heading": "Categorizing the Stations based on Maximum Shortage (ADMS) or Excess (ADME)", "text": "ADMS measures the maximum scarcity of a station during a given period, averaged over every day of a quarter. ADME measures the maximum excess. To calculate the maximum scarcity of a station between 1 and 2, we sort all pickups and pickups for the station that happen between 1 and 2, based on their occurrence time, so that the earliest pick-up or drop-off occurs first. We start with the shortage at 1. Then we process each pick-up and pick-up individually. Every time we see a pick-up, we increase the shortage, and every time we see a waste, we reduce the shortage. Once the entire list of pickups and drop-offs is processed, we take the maximum positive number that we had for the shortage, as the maximum scarcity for that particular period of the day. The smallest negative number is the maximum overrun, and when we see a waste, we reduce the shortage. After calculating these two measures for every day in a quarter, the daily pickup period is the average for the ME."}, {"heading": "RESULTS", "text": "The main questions and answers on this topic are: What about the people who live in the city, and what about the people who live in the city, and what about the people who live in the city, and what about the people who live in the city, and what about the people who live in the city, and what about the people who live in the city, and what about the people who live in the city, and what about the people who live in the city?"}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "As part of an ongoing effort to improve the efficiency of bike share systems, this study uses clustering methods to consolidate data retrieved from Capital Bikeshare, one of the largest bike share systems in North America. Methods used can help visualize overall trends in pickup and drop-off, but they can also help identify compensation requirements required at different times of the day. Stations are grouped at different times of the day based on their imbalance severity, and this approach can be used to identify stations with a high probability of being full or empty, and then deal with these problematic stations by applying various techniques such as applying pickup / drop-off incentives to / from these stations. Results show that most of the pickups and drop-offs occur during morning and afternoon spikes for Capital Bikeshare, whereas pickups and drop-offs are distributed more evenly during the weekends."}], "references": [{"title": "The bike-sharing world", "author": ["P.
