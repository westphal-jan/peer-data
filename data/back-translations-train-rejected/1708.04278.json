Data Security and Data Privacy protection systems (DSDP) monitor data access and usage to identify leakage or suspicious activities that should be investigated. Because of the high velocity nature of database systems, such systems audit only a portion of the vast number of transactions that take place.

(2) When sampled, it is compared to the previous set of sampled observations. (3) The user's method is estimated on the basis of mean and standard deviation. (4) An observation is characterized as an anomaly by the sham system if the observation value difference from the user's mean is greater than three standard deviations. Each sampling method was applied three times with different random seeds, and the results were averaged. We sampled in four proportions: 35%, 30%, 25%, and 20%. Sampling of the individual classes in the \"combination method\" was set at 80% for the risky class and 20% for the non-risky class 4.
