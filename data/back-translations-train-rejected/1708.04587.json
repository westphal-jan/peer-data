In the first approach, we generate the summaries by applying purely term-based clustering and cluster labeling. The second approach makes use of X-means for clustering and Mutual Information for labeling the clusters. Both approaches are driven by ontologies. We visualize the results using bar charts.

In addition, other useful key features are the feature of debate title words and the cosine similarity of debate title words and sentences. The complete set of results is shown in Table 1."}, {"heading": "4.2 Term-Based Clustering", "text": "We used the English ClimaPinion service5 from the DecarboNet project6 as background knowledge to capture climate change issues and extract up-to-date terms from each sentence that stood out. To obtain clusters, we grouped sentences with the same name within the same cluster. If a sentence contained more than one term, it was assigned to several groups that allowed for soft clustering of the sentence. 7 Also note that terms with the same semantic meaning can be expressed differently. To achieve this, we received a list of its synonyms for each label from WordNet (Miller, 1995)."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Evaluation", "text": "The evaluation of the ontology-based term extraction has been evaluated elsewhere. Consisting of two environmental ontologies, GEMET (GEneral Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus) and Reegle, ClimaPinion delivers great results in recognizing environmental terms in the text with the accuracy, recall and F1 measure of 85.87%, 53.05% and 65.58%, respectively (Maynard and Bontcheva, 2015).

We calculated an average silhouette score and reported it in Table 2. As shown in the table, the system generated 39 clusters based on the climate change terms commented on by the ClimaPinion service. It reached the silhouette score by zero, similar to the work presented by Wang and Koopman (2017). Interpretation based on the score is that the data points are mapped almost to the decision limits of the clusters. In particular, when outstanding sets contain several climate change themes, clear cluster limits are difficult to achieve. This circumstance suggests that such a simple cluster approach is less suitable for summarizing semantically similar sets and that the task requires more sophisticated ways to achieve better performance."}, {"heading": "4.3 Term-Based Label Extraction", "text": "After grouping distinctive sentences, the groups or clusters should be given labels that clearly reflect the content of the clusters (Aker et al., 2016). Similar to the cluster approach, where we group distinctive sentences according to the ontological term they have in common, we used the sharing term as a label to represent the cluster, based on the assumption that the terms of climate change commented on in the sentences already elaborate the central meaning of the clusters."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Evaluation", "text": "It is a common approach in most information systems (Ponte and Croft, 1998), which consist of two main components, tf and idf. In our experiment, the frequency of terms in a cluster. idf represents the number of clusters in which the term occurs. These components allow us to reduce the discriminatory terms in the clusters. To determine the candidate labels, we calculate the score for the multiplication of tf and idf."}, {"heading": "4.4 X-means Clustering", "text": "In Section 4.2, we have shown that the idea of clustering based on common terms leads to poor cluster performance, leading to too many clusters that are very close to each other. In this section, we want to overcome the problem of poor performance of the term-based cluster approach and use X-means (Pelleg and Moore, 2000), an extended version of K-means, to cluster the distinctive sentences selected by the summation system. One of the advantages of Xmeans is that it is able to automatically capture the number of clusters. By calculating the results of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), X-means decides whether cluster centrioids should be divided. We have used ontology-based vector space models.The measurement is made using nltk metrics, http: / / www.nltk.org / api / nltk.metrics.html.to to to to generate vectors as similarity inputs for Xmeans."}, {"heading": "4.4.1 Similarity Measurement", "text": "In defining our similarity measurement, the automatically selected prominent sentences are converted into vectors using the vector space model (VSM). In the document indexing phase, we used the ontologies to automatically comment on key terms of climate change in the SSSD. Using an ontological approach favors the transformation of words into vectors by helping to grasp the relevance of certain topics. We derived 64 significant topics on climate change. Term frequency was counted for each term to generate vectors for each sentence. To generate a similarity matrix, cosine similarity measurement was used to calculate cosinal similarity values between the vectors. After constructing the similarity matrix, we applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 10 for dimensionality reduction."}, {"heading": "4.4.2 Evaluation", "text": "As shown in the table, the average silhouette score is derived from the calculation based on the similarity definition of the ontology-based vector spatial model. We achieved a high silhouette score of 0.9878, for a total of 19 clusters generated. A silhouette close to 1.0 indicates good cohesion and separation of cluster results, meaning that the average distance from one coordinate in a cluster to the other coordinates within its own cluster is smaller than the average distance from all coordinates in the next cluster. In addition, the coordinates in the clusters are close to 0 or at the decision boundary between two adjacent clusters. A negative silhouette score is obtained when coordinates may be assigned to wrong clusters. In other words, the coordinates in the adjacent clusters are close or at the decision boundary between two adjacent clusters."}, {"heading": "19 0.9878", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.5 Label Generation with Mutual Information", "text": "In order to generate labels from the X-meaning clusters, we could have taken the same approach as described in Section 4.3, namely selecting a term shared by all or a majority of the most important sentences within a cluster. However, to our surprise, the performance was very low compared to what we achieved in Section 4.3. Nevertheless, this helped us to draw two conclusions. Firstly, the performance in Section 4.3 is high because the labels were selected in such a way that all the outstanding sentences within a group shared this label. Secondly, the size of the cluster was not so large that the label had a high chance of being representative of the cluster. These images changed as the cluster size increased and the outstanding sentences also covered several different climate change terms. Secondly, because selecting a label was not simply about selecting the term that appears in all or a majority of the most important sentences. We used Labeled labels to make an informed choice (MI) for us."}, {"heading": "4.5.1 Labeling Evaluation", "text": "In order to evaluate the system markers generated by the results of the X-Mean Cluster Approach, we used the same evaluation procedure as the baseline discussed in Section 4.3.1. The results are illustrated in Figure 2. As can be seen in the figure, the average system preference values exceed the baseline. In Q1, the system markers are more comprehensible than the baseline markers with the mean difference of 0.10. In Q2, the system markers indicate more complete phrases than the baseline markers with a higher mean value of 0.13. Finally, the system markers in Q3 are still better than the baseline markers with the mean difference of 0.05. The system markers are more meaningful for representing the central meaning of the content in the clusters. However, since there is a slight difference between the results of the system markers and the baseline markers, the Mann-Whitney U test shows that there is no significant difference with the values of Wz-W05 -3870.9, 3840.81, and a further Q40.27, respectively."}, {"heading": "4.6 Visualization", "text": "Sanchan et al. (2016) have manually examined various models of representation in order to display or supplement summaries of online debates. Contrary to traditional summaries, excerpts from the debates must capture the main concepts discussed by both sides and allow the reader to view these concepts on the part of both proponents and opponents. The authors have proposed the summary of the diagrams, which presents the clusters with bars. Each bar is marked with the cluster label. In this work, we adopt the summary of the diagrams for visualization purposes. We call this approach alignment. In generating the bars in Chart Summary, the bars are the clusters that express related content on both opposite sides. Therefore, it is important to bring together clusters from the two opposite sides that express the related content."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we explored one of the novel and challenging problems of automated text summarization of online debates and proposed a framework to address this problem, with the aim of generating chart summaries that represent the high-level topics of online debates. The chart summary consists of three main components, including the bars, labels, and frequencies of the bars. We proposed an ontological term-based cluster formation and cluster labeling pipeline to guide the debate summary. In our approach, we used an online service to automatically comment on climate change terms in distinctive sentences and group-related distinctive sentences in the same cluster. For clustering, we examined two variants that both use ontological terms. The second approach applies Xmeans clustering. Assessment has shown that the X-mean approach is a better choice for clustering."}], "references": [{"title": "Automatic label generation for news comment clusters", "author": ["Ahmet Aker", "Monica Lestari Paramita", "Emina Kurtic", "Adam Funk", "Emma Barker", "Mark Hepple", "Robert J.
