INTRODUCTION", "text": "Due to the development of various data acquisitions and big data technologies, the ability to collect a variety of data and monitor the observation over long periods of time has been achieved in different disciplines. For most real-world applications, the primary goal of monitoring these observations is to obtain a better estimate of the survival of the time of occurrence of a particular event of interest. One of the main challenges for such time-to-event data is that there are usually censored instances, i.e. the event of interest is not observed for these instances due to the time limitation of the study period or loses track during the observation period. More precisely, certain instances have experienced an event (or referred to as an event) and the information about the outcome is variable for the remaining instances only up to a certain point in the study. Therefore, it is not appropriate to apply predictive algorithms directly and to analyze machine learning approaches."}, {"heading": "2. DEFINITION OF SURVIVAL ANALYSIS", "text": "In this section, we will first present the basic notations and terminologies used in this paper, then give an illustrative example that explains the structure of the survival data and gives a more formal problem for survival analysis, and finally, we will also give a complete taxonomy of the existing methods of survival analysis available in the literature, including conventional statistical methods and machine learning approaches. It provides a holistic view of the field of survival analysis and will help readers acquire the basic knowledge of the methods used in this area before embarking on the detailed algorithms."}, {"heading": "2.1. Survival Data and Censoring", "text": "While investigating a survival analysis problem, it is possible that the events of interest are not observed for some cases; this scenario occurs mainly due to the limited observation window or lack of trace caused by other uninterested events. This concept is known as censorship, for which the observed survival time is less than or equal to the actual survival time. (ii) Instance can categorize censorship into three groups for which the observed survival time is greater or equal to the true survival time; and (iii) interval censorship, for which we only know that the event occurs during a given time interval. It should be noted that the true event is unknown in all three cases."}, {"heading": "2.2. Survival and Hazard Function", "text": "The survival function used to represent the probability that the time to the event of interest does not occur earlier than a predetermined time t (Lee and Wang 2003; Klein and Moeschberger 2005) is one of the primary goals in the survival analysis. Conventionally, the survival function is represented by S, which is stated as follows: S (t) = Pr (T \u2265 t). (2) The survival function decreases monotonously with t, and the initial value is 1 if t = 0, which represents the fact that 100% of the subjects survive at the beginning of the observation; in other words, none of the events of interest has occurred. On the contrary, the cumulative death distribution function F (t) \u2212 t, which represents the probability that the event of interest occurs earlier than t, is defined as F (t) = 1 \u2212 S (t) = 1 \u2212 S (t), and the death density function cannot be defined as f (t)."}, {"heading": "2.3. Taxonomy of Survival Analysis methods", "text": "Broadly speaking, survival analysis methods can be divided into two main categories: statistical methods and methods based on machine learning. Statistical methods share the common goal with machine learning methods to make predictions about survival time and estimate the likelihood of survival at the estimated time of survival. However, they focus more on characterizing both the distributions of event times and the statistical properties of parameter estimation by estimating the survival curves, while machine learning methods generally focus more on predicting the event at a given time by incorporating traditional methods of survival analysis with various machine learning techniques. Machine learning methods are generally applied to the high-dimensional problems, while statistical methods are generally developed for the low-dimensional data. In addition, machine learning methods for survival analysis provide more effective algorithms by incorporating survival problems with both statistical cognitive learning methods and optimization of recent developments in both machine learning and machine learning."}, {"heading": "3. TRADITIONAL STATISTICAL METHODS", "text": "In this section, we will introduce three different types of statistical methods to estimate the survival / hazard functions: non-parametric, semi-parametric and parametric methods. Table II shows both the advantages and disadvantages of each type of method based on theoretical and experimental analysis and lists the specific methods in each type.Non-parametric methods are more efficient when there is no underlying distribution for the event time or the proportional risk assumption. In non-parametric methods, an empirical estimate of survival function is used using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, Nelson eel estimator (NA) or life table (LT) method. More generally, the KM estimator for the likelihood of survival at the specified survival time is a product of the same estimate up to the previous time and the observed survival rate for the given time. The KM ression 2010s method is also referred to as the product limitation method."}, {"heading": "3.1. Non-parametric Models", "text": "Of all the functions, the survival function or its graphical representation is the most widespread. In 1958, Kaplan and Meier [Kaplan and Meier 1958] developed the Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve or the product limit (PL) estimator to estimate the survival function based on the actual length of the observed time. However, this method is the most widely used for estimating the survival function. Let T1 < T2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 < TK be a series of clearly ordered event times observed for N (K \u2264 N) cases. In addition to these event times, there are also censorship times for cases whose event times are not observed. It is worth noting that for a specific event time Tj (j = 1, 2, \u00b7, K) the number of observed events is considered to be dj \u2265 1, and rj instances are considered \"at risk\" because their event time or censored time is greater or equal to Tj. It is worth noting that j rj = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = = j = j = j = = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = j = = j = j = j = = j = = j = = j = = = = j = = = = j = = = = = j = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ="}, {"heading": "3.2. Semi-Parametric Models", "text": "As a hybrid of parametric and non-parametric approaches (Xi = Xip = 0), a more consistent estimator can be achieved under a wider range of conditions compared to the parametric models and a more accurate estimator than the non-parametric methods [Powell 1994]. Cox's model [David 1972] is the most commonly used method for survival analysis in this category. Unlike parametric methods, knowledge of the underlying distribution of time to the event of interest is not required, but the attributes are thought to have an exponential impact on the outcome. We will now discuss the details of the Cox model in more detail and then describe various variants and extensions of the basic Cox model, such as regulated Cox models, CoxBoost and TimeDependent Cox.3.1. The Basic Cox model is for a given instance i, represented by a triplet (Xi, yi), which follows the hazard function h (t) in the Xi Cox model."}, {"heading": "3.3. Parametric Models", "text": "The parametric regression models assume that the survival times or the logarithm of the survival times of all instances in the data follow a certain theoretical distribution (Lee and Wang 2003) These models are important alternatives to the Cox-based semi-parametric models and are also used in many areas of application. However, it is easy, efficient and effective to predict the time to the event of interest using parametric methods. Parametric survival models tend to obtain the survival estimates that are consistent with a theoretical survival distribution. The commonly used distributions in parametric regression models are: normal, exponential, exponential, logical-logistic and log-normal. If the survival times of all instances in the data follow these distributions, the model is called linear regression models. If the logarithms of the survival times of all instances follow these distributions, the problem of failure can be analyzed based on accelerated failure."}, {"heading": "4. MACHINE LEARNING METHODS", "text": "In recent years, they have achieved significant successes in various practical areas due to the advantages of machine learning methods, such as their ability to model nonlinear relationships, and the quality of their overall predictions. In survival analysis, the biggest challenge of machine learning methods is the difficulty of dealing adequately with censored information and the timing of the model. Machine learning is effective when there are a large number of cases in a reasonable dimensional trait space, but this is not the case for specific problems in survival analysis [Zupan et al. 2000]. In this section, we will conduct a comprehensive review of commonly used machine learning methods in survival analysis."}, {"heading": "4.1. Survival Trees", "text": "The basic intuition behind the tree models is the recursive division of data based on a particular splitting criterion, and the objects that are similar to each other based on the event of interest are placed in the same node. However, the earliest attempt to use a tree structure for survival data was made in [Ciampi et al. 1981]. [Gordon and Olshen 1985] is the first paper to discuss the creation of survival trees.The primary difference between a survival tree and the standard decision tree is in the choice of the splitting criterion for the splitting criterion. The decision tree method performs a recursive splitting of data by setting a threshold for each trait, but it cannot take into account either the interactions between the features or the censored information in the model. [Safavian and Landgrebe 1991] The splitting criteria used for survival trees can be grouped into two categories: mimimixing and mimimimicking."}, {"heading": "4.2. Bayesian Methods", "text": "Bayes Theorem is one of the most basic principles in probability theory and mathematical statistics; it establishes a link between posterior probability and the previous probability, so that one can see the changes in probability values before and after taking into account a particular event. Bayes Theorem has two models, Na\u0131 \ufffd ve Bayes (NB) and Bayesian Network (BN) [Friedman et al. 1997]. Both of these approaches, which provide the probability of an event of interest as well as its results, are often examined in the context of clinical prediction [Kononenko 1993; Pepe 2003; Zupan et al. 2000]. Experimental results of using Bayean methods on survival data show that Bayean methods have good properties of both interpretability and argument of uncertainty [Raftery et al. 1995]. Na\u0131 \ufffd ve Bayeve Bayes, a well-known probabilistic method in machine learning, is one of the predictive algorithms."}, {"heading": "4.3. Artificial Neural Networks", "text": "Inspired by biological neural systems, Frank Rosenblatt published the first paper [Rosenblatt 1958] on artificial neural networks (ANN) in 1958. In this approach, the simple artificial nodes referred to as \"neurons\" are connected on the basis of a weighted connection to form a network that simulates a biological neural network. A neuron in this context is a computer element that consists of sets of adaptive weights and generates the output on the basis of a certain type of activation function. Artificial neural network (ANN) has been widely used in survival analysis. In the literature, three types of methods are proposed that use the neural network method to solve the survival analysis problems. (1) Neural network survival analysis has been applied to predict the survival time of a subject directly from the given inputs. (2) The authors in [Faraggi and Simon 1995] extended the Cox PH model to include the neural and proposed neural structure."}, {"heading": "4.4. Support Vector Machines", "text": "It has also been successfully included in the Survival Analysis. However, one naive way is to avoid the events in the Regression Support (SVR). The main disadvantages of this approach are that the sequence of information contained in the censored instances is completely inadequate."}, {"heading": "4.5. Advanced Machine Learning Approaches", "text": "In the last few years, more advanced machine learning methods have been developed to deal with censored data and to predict it. These methods have various unique advantages in terms of survival data compared to the other methods described in far.4.5.1. It is often possible to construct good ensembles and achieve a better approach to the unknown function by varying the starting points, especially in the presence of insufficient data. To overcome the instability of a single method, one has to deal with random forests [Breiman 2001] proposed by Breiman in order to perform ensemble formation, and such ensemble models have been successfully adapted to survival analyses whose temporal complexity is mainly that of base learners.Bagging Survival Trees is one of the oldest and most commonly used ensemble methods, which generally reduces the variance of survival models."}, {"heading": "5. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION METRICS", "text": "Due to the presence of censorship in the survival data, the standard evaluation metrics for regression such as Root of Mean Square Error and R2 are not suitable for measuring performance in survival analysis [Heagerty and Zheng 2005]. Instead, predictive performance in survival analysis must be measured with more specialized evaluation metrics."}, {"heading": "5.1. C-index", "text": "Survival analysis is a common way of evaluating a model to consider the relative risk of an event for different cases, without taking into account the absolute survival times for each instance, by calculating the concordance probability or the concordance index (C-index) [Harrell et al. 1984; Harrell et al. 1982; Pencina and D'Agostino 2004]. Survival times of two instances can be sorted for two scenarios: (1) both are uncensored; (2) the observed survival time of the uncensored instance is less than the censored instance's [Steck et al. 2008]. This can be visualized by the graphics ordered, which are used in Figure 4 (a) and Figure 4 (b) to illustrate the possible ranking comparisons between instances for survival data without and with censored instances."}, {"heading": "5.2. Brier Score", "text": "Named after the inventor Glenn W. Brier, the Brier Score (BS) [Brier 1950] is designed to predict the inaccuracy of the probable weather forecasts. It can only evaluate the prediction models that have probable results; that is, the result must remain within the range [0,1], and the sum of all possible results for a given person should be 1. Considering the binary result of the prediction with a sample of N instances, and for each Xi (i = 1, 2,..., N), the predicted result is at t y-i (t), and the actual result is yi (t); then the empirical definition of the Brier score can be given at a certain point in time by t."}, {"heading": "5.3. Mean Absolute Error", "text": "For survival analysis problems, the mean absolute error (MAE) can be defined as the average of the differences between the predicted time values and the actual observation time values. It is calculated as follows: MAE = 1N N \u2211 i = 1 (\u03b4i | yi \u2212 y-i |) (28), with yi (i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, N) representing the actual observation times and y \u0435i (i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7, N) representing the predicted times. It should be noted that this measurement only takes into account the samples for which the event occurs, since the corresponding term zero is used at \u03b4i = 0. MAE can only be used to evaluate survival models that can provide the event time as the predicted target value, such as AFT models."}, {"heading": "6. RELATED TOPICS", "text": "In addition to the machine learning methods presented in Section 4 and the traditional statistical survival methods discussed in Section 3, there are few other topics that are closely related to survival analysis, and we will now summarize them.XXX, Vol. X, No. X, Article 1, Publication date: August 2017."}, {"heading": "6.1. Early Prediction", "text": "One of the primary challenges associated with survival analysis and in general longitudinal studies is that a sufficient number of events in the training data can only be recorded by long waiting. This is the most significant difference from the regularly monitored learning problems, where the designations for each case can be given by a domain expert within a reasonable period of time. There are many real-world applications that motivate the need for new predictive models that can only work using data collected in the early stages of the studies. In the health field, for example, it is crucial to study the effects of a new treatment in order to understand the treatment or efficacy of drugs that should be assessed as early as possible. In this case, patients are monitored for a certain period of time and the event of interest is predicted to the patient due to treatment failure."}, {"heading": "6.2. Data Transformation", "text": "In fact, it is a way in which people are able to determine for themselves how they have behaved."}, {"heading": "6.3. Complex Events", "text": "In this section, we will discuss two techniques, namely competing risks and recurring events, in order to tackle such complex events.6.3.1. Competing risks, if several different types of events are taken into account, which we have previously discussed, we will consider them as complex events. In this section, we will discuss two techniques, namely competing risks and recurring events, in order to tackle such complex events.6.3.3. Competing risks, if several different types of events are taken into account, but only one of them can occur for each instance over the subsequent period, then the competing risks are defined as the probabilities of different events. In other words, the competing risks will only exist in survival problems if several types of events are taken into account, but only one of them can occur for each instance over the subsequent period, then the competing risks are defined as the probabilities of different events."}, {"heading": "7. APPLICATION DOMAINS", "text": "In this section we will show the application of Survival Analysis in various areas of the real world. Table V summarizes the interesting events, the expected goal and the characteristics typically used in each specific application described in this section."}, {"heading": "7.1. Healthcare", "text": "In the health field, the starting point of observation is usually a particular medical intervention such as admission to hospital, the start of taking a particular drug or the diagnosis of a particular disease [Klein and Moeschberger 2005; Miller Jr 2011]. The event of interest may be death, hospitalization, discharge from hospital or another interesting incident occurring during the observation period XXX, Vol. X, No. X, Article 1, Release Date: August 2017.The lack of trace of observation is also an important feature of the data collected in this area. For example, during a particular hospital stay some patients may be transferred to another hospital and in such cases that patientXXX, Vol. X, No. X, Article 1, Release Date: August 2017.from the study with respect to the first hospital after that date will be ignored. In the health field, survival prognosis models are primarily aimed at estimating the distribution of downtime and the prognostic evaluation of different characteristics, including histological, chemical and clinical features [2004 and]."}, {"heading": "7.2. Reliability", "text": "In the field of reliability, it is common practice to collect data over a certain period of time and record the interesting events that occur within that period. Reliability forecasting focuses on developing methods to accurately estimate the reliability of the new products [Modarres et al. 2009; Lyu 1996]. The event that is of interest here is the time it takes for a device to fail. In such applications, it is desirable to be able to estimate which devices will fail and, if so, when they will fail. Survival analysis methods can help build such predictive models, using the available information on these devices. These models can provide early warnings of potential failures, which is essential to either prevent or reduce the likelihood of failure, and to identify and correct the causes of device failures."}, {"heading": "7.3. Crowdfunding", "text": "Although crowdfunding platforms have been successful, the percentage of projects that have achieved their desired target amount is less than 50% [Rakesh et al. 2015]. Furthermore, many of the prominent crowdfunding platforms follow the \"all-or-nothing\" policy. In other words, if the target is achieved before the given period, the promised funding can be collected. Therefore, one of the most important challenges in crowdfunding is to estimate the likelihood of success of each project. The need to estimate the likelihood of success of the project motivates the development of new forecasting approaches that can integrate the advantages of both regression (to estimate the time of success) and classification (to simultaneously take into account successful and failed projects in the model) [Li et al. 2016a]. For successful projects, the time to success can be easily collected."}, {"heading": "7.4. Bioinformatics", "text": "One of the most popular applications of survival analysis in the field of bioinformatics is gene expression. Gene expression is the process of synthesizing a functional gene product from gene information and can be quantified by measuring either the messenger RNA (mRNA) or proteins. Gene expression profiling is being developed as a powerful technique for studying cell transcriptome. In recent years, several studies [Li et al. 2016d; Beer et al. 2002] have correlated gene expression with survival outcomes in cancer applications across the genome. Survival analysis methods are helpful in assessing the effect of a single gene on survival prognosis and then identify the most relevant genes as biomarkers for patients. In this scenario, the event is of interest to the specific type of cancer (or disease), and the goal is to estimate the likelihood of cancer based on the measurements of gene expression."}, {"heading": "7.5. Student Retention", "text": "In the US and around the world, one of a university's long-term goals is to improve student retention; higher student retention rates, more likely to position the university higher, secure more government funding, and have an easier path to program accreditation; for these reasons, directors and administrators in higher education are constantly trying to implement new strategies to increase student retention. Survival analyses are successful in addressing student retention issues [Murtaugh et al. 1999; Ameri et al. 2016]. The goal of survival analysis is to assess the timing of events occurring, which is critical in student retention issues, as both the correct determination of whether a student is dropping out and the assessment of when they occur. In such cases, it will be helpful to reliably assess the risk of dropping out of studies in the early stages of education by using both information about student enrollment and the time of enrollment."}, {"heading": "7.6. Customer Lifetime Value", "text": "The Customer Life Value (LTV) [Berger and Nasr 1998; Zeithaml et al. 2001] of a customer refers to the profit that the customer brings to the store based on the purchase history. In marketing, the customer life value is used to evaluate the relationship between the customer and the store. For a business, it is important to improve the LTV in order to maintain or increase its profits in the long term, as it is often quite expensive to acquire new customers. In this case, the main objective of this problem is to identify the purchasing behavior of customers with a high LTV and to make recommendations for a relatively new user of similar interest. The identification of loyal customers using the LTV estimate has been investigated by various researchers [Rosset et al. 2003; Mani et al. 1999] using survival analysis methods and data mining approaches that are helpful in identifying the purchasing behavior. Subsequently, LTV is defined using a survival function that can be used to estimate the store's age and the store's demographic for each purchase time, as well as the customer's income."}, {"heading": "7.7. Click-Through Rate", "text": "Nowadays, many free web services, including online news portals, search engines and social networks, provide advertisements to users [Barbieri et al. 2016]. Both the topics and the order of the ads influence the click probability of the user [Richardson et al. 2007]. Studies focused largely on predicting the click rate (CTR), which indicates the percentage of users clicking on a particular ad. It can be calculated as the ratio of click times and the corresponding presentation times (number of ad impressions).The CTR value indicates the attractiveness effect of the ad for users [Barbieri et al. 2016]. The aim is to predict how likely the user is to click on the ads based on the information available on the website, users and ads. The time required to click on the ad is considered an event time. Users who do not click on the ads are considered a censored observation. XXX, Vol. X, NoX, Article: August 1, 2017 Release Date."}, {"heading": "7.8. Duration Modeling in Economics", "text": "Traditionally, long-term data measuring how long people remain in a given state are evaluated in biometric and medical statistics using methods of survival analysis. In fact, the long-term data also appear in a variety of economic situations, such as the duration of unemployment, marital instability, and the time to the stock market transaction. Among them, the problem of duration of unemployment that is most studied analyzes the time people spend out of work [Gamerman and West 1987]. Generally, in the field of economics, the period of unemployment is extremely important, since the duration of people's unemployment plays a crucial role in the economic theories of job search [Kiefer 1988]. For this problem, the data contain information on the duration of unemployment for each individual in the sample. The interesting thing about this is to get a new job for each person, and the goal is to predict the likelihood of getting a new job within a certain period of time. It is desirable to understand how the likelihood of reemployment changes over the period and to know more about the effects of the unemployment support probabilities."}, {"heading": "8. RESOURCES", "text": "This section contains a list of software implementations developed using various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms for survival analysis. Table VI summarizes the basic information of the software packages for each survival method. We note that most of the existing survival analysis methods can be implemented in R. (1) Non-parametric methods: All three non-parametric survival analysis methods can be implemented by integrating the coxph and Survfit function into the survival package in R. (2) Semi-parametric methods: Both the basic Cox model and the time-dependent Cox model can be trained using the Coxph function in the survival package in R. The LassoCox, Ridge-Cox and EN-Cox in the regulated Cox methods can be trained using the cocktail function in the Fastcox package. The RegCox package can be used to implement the OSCAR Cox-Cox Cox Cox method."}, {"heading": "9. CONCLUSION", "text": "The primary objective of survival analysis is to predict the occurrence of specific events of interest at future times. Due to the widespread availability of survival data from different areas of the real world in combination with recent developments in various machine learning methods, there is an increasing need to understand and improve methods for effectively handling survival data. In this survey article, we presented a comprehensive review of conventional survival analysis methods and various machine learning methods for survival analysis and described other related topics along with the assessment metrics. First, we introduced the basic notations and concepts in survival analysis, including the structure of survival data and the common functionsXXX, Volume X, No. X, Article 1, Release Date: August 2017.

One of the main challenges in this context is the presence of instances whose event outcomes become unobservable after a certain time point or when some instances do not experience any event during the monitoring period. Such a phenomenon is called censoring which can be effectively handled using survival analysis techniques. Traditionally, statistical approaches have been widely developed in the literature to overcome this censoring issue. In addition, many machine learning algorithms are adapted to effectively handle survival data and tackle other challenging problems that arise in real-world data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of the representative statistical methods along with the machine learning techniques used in survival analysis and provide a detailed taxonomy of the existing methods. We also discuss several topics that are closely related to survival analysis and illustrate several successful applications in various real-world application domains. We hope that this paper will provide a more thorough understanding of the recent advances in survival analysis and offer some guidelines on applying these approaches to solve new problems that arise in applications with censored data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
