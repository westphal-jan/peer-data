Related Work", "text": "The work of [Che et al. 2016] and [Tilk et al. 2016] use word embedding to recognize boundaries in prepared language sentences, specifically in the corpus of 2012 TED talks2. [Che et al. 2016] suggest a CNN (Convolution Neural Network) -based method with 50 dimensions that GloVe [Pennington et al. 2014] uses. In [Klejch et al. 2016, Klejch et al. 2017], the authors show that textual information influences the recovery of punctuation marks more than prosodic information, even without the use of word embedding. The work in [Klejch et al. 2015, Klejch et al. 2017] is expanded into [Tilk and Aluma \u00a4e 2016], using bidirectional neural networks with attention mechanisms that evaluate spontaneous telephone conversations corpus. The authors point out that the bidirectional vision of the Nural receptor network is a neuronal host."}, {"heading": "3. Word Embeddings Models", "text": "The work of [Turian et al. 2010] divides these representations into three categories: cluster-based, distributional, and distributed methods. In this paper, we focus only on distributed representations, since they are generally induced more quickly in terms of computation; these representations are based on real vectors induced in a multidimensional space by unattended learning. In the following paragraphs, we describe the three induction techniques for word embedding that are used in our evaluations. A well-used NLP technique, Word2vec [Mikolov et al. 2013] follows the same principle as the natural language model presented in [Collobert and Weston 2008], except that it does not use hidden methods for word embedding that generate a vector model in which the vector model is used."}, {"heading": "4. Experimental Setup", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1. Corpora/Datasets", "text": "The data sets were divided into two categories: impaired speech and prepared speech. Impaired speech is not only spontaneous, but also loud. Noise is generated internally due to the impaired neuropsychological state of the participants studied. When people take neuropsychological tests, they produce the following phenomena: syntactically malformed sentences; mispronounced words (change in the original morphology); low-quality prosody (due to the flat voices of participants and / or abnormal fluctuations in voice quality); and generally a large quantity and variety of types of disorders. The first set of data in the discourse tests is a set of impaired speech narratives, based on a book of sequenced images from the known history of Cinderella. This data set consists of 60 narrative texts narrated by Brazilian Portuguese speakers; 20 healthy subjects called controls (CTL); 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); and 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MD)."}, {"heading": "4.2. Method", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do and what they want to do."}, {"heading": "5. Results and Discussion", "text": "We performed a 5-fold cross-validation for each group analyzed (CLT, MCI or AD), which left about 10% of the data for testing, the rest for training. The performance results of the RCNN in relation to F1 for each type of patient and on the constitution data set are shown in Figure 3, for which we vary the embedding methods and their training strategies along with the induced vector dimensions between the values of: d \u00b2 50, 100, 300, 600}. In most cases, Word2vec achieved better performance than other methods. In particular, for CTL with Skip-gram and FastText with CBOW, which yield an F1 of 0.76, on the other hand, we see that for MCI patients, Wang2vec with Skip-gram was the best technique, giving an F1 of 0.74. For AD subjects, the best technique was Word2vec with CBOW, which returns a spontaneous formula of 0.66."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "Our goal in this work was to identify the embedding with the best performance for SBD, in particular, whether it would be one that would capture semantic information, such as Word2vec; syntactic, such as Wang2vec; or morphological, such as FastText. However, we were unable to identify which type was generally most influential, since the differences from one to another are very small. Even if one technique was superior to another for one particular set, we still need to investigate whether this was actually the fault of the technique or due to secondary factors, such as hyperparameters, random initialization, or even the conditions of the data used. In general, our results show that using only embedding the RCNN method can achieve similar results (difference of 1%) with the state of the art in relation to F1, using the same method published in [Treviso et al. 2017] for both classes: CTL and MCI, using embedding with 600 dimensional and odic information dimensions."}], "references": [{"title": "Evaluating progression of alzheimer\u2019s disease by regression and classification methods in a narrative language test in portuguese", "author": ["Alu\u0131\u0301sio"], "venue": "In PROPOR,", "citeRegEx": "Alu\u0131\u0301sio,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Alu\u0131\u0301sio", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Using stylometric features for sentiment classification.
