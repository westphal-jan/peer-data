INTRODUCTIONThe rise of machine learning and the accompanying development of various deep learning methods in recent years seems promising, as such methods are capable of learning rich, nonlinear characterizations, and such representations have proven useful in a variety of areas, including medicine and public health. This work looks at methods applied to such areas. Specifically, our focus is on exploring different representations of geographic characteristics that can be used to generate survival curves for patients in the State of Iowa. To investigate such a problem, we look at Figure 1, which shows that colorectal cancer mortality rates, which range from 1989 to 2013, by digit tabulation range (ZCTA), for the State of Iowa. First, we would like to point out that many digits have mortality rates at or above 30%, which shows the importance of assessing patients \"survival prospects at the time of diagnosis to make accurate treatment decisions."}, {"heading": "II.

Finally, we will discuss the various geographical representations examined in this paper."}, {"heading": "A.

Here, t (i) represents a discrete time in which the event of interest e (i) occurred (i.e., e (i) = 1) or the last discrete time instance i was observed and the event did not occur (i.e., e (i) = 0). In this latter case (i) = 0), if t (i) = T we know that the event never occurs during the study period (across T discrete time periods). However, if t (i) < T then we only know that the instance did not experience the event until (i), we do not know."}, {"heading": "B. Kaplan-Meier Re-representation", "text": "With our preliminary notation we return to the elaboration of the censored nature of the data. However, as already mentioned, each instance i has a corresponding event label e (i) and the time of the event t (i). However, we would like to transform this tubular representation into one in the form of a Kaplan Meier Survival Curve (KMSC) [3]. Simply put, a KMSC associates each temporal unit - in this case the values 1,.., T - with a probability of the event e (i) that does not occur until that particular time, for example. Practically speaking, this representation will take the form of a vector y (i), where the indices t (1,...., T) include the temporal units and the inputs y (i) t (i) t (t) t of the corresponding probabilities. We apply the reproduction method outlined in Chi et al [4] to produce an event (i) that i (i) (i) (i) = 1 (i) generate."}, {"heading": "C. Predicting Individual KMSC", "text": "The ultimate goal of this paper is to learn a hypothesis that belongs to some (currently) arbitrarily defined class G hypotheses that most accurately predicts patient-specific RMSCs. Formally, however, this problem can be written as if it is an arbitrary loss function that measures the inequality between the predicted y (i) (i), g (x (i)) and the known y (i). In this paper, we define our class G hypotheses as both flat and deep neural networks, the specific architecture of which is further elaborated in this section, with parameterization discussed in the experimental section."}, {"heading": "D. Geographic Feature Representation", "text": "While we are ultimately interested in producing a g that produces the most accurate predictions, the niche of this work is to: 1) Show whether geographic characteristics improve the quality of predictions. 2) Determine whether a simple binary representation or a richer representation (defined shortly) leads to better predictions. 3) Experimentally, we quantify the extent of such improvements. 1) Simple graphical representation of our experiments and data in the next section, where two geographical representations are examined: a simple binary representation (SBR) and a richer representation produced via spectral analysis (RR-SA). 1) Simple graphical representation: The simple binary representation (SBR) is a minimalist representation that contains only (one) determination of the instance of i's discrete geographical entity and (b) a binary re-representation of such representation (other than a hot encoding) that we generate."}, {"heading": "III.

After removing identifiers and features that exhibit a large number of cases with missing values (% missing > 50%), we were left with m = 26 unique characteristics (including unprocessed geographic coordinates) and m = 386 (without geographic characteristics) after binding discrete characteristics. By using geographic rerepresentation of SBR, m = 1364 (386 non-geographic characteristics and p = 978 binary geographic characteristics) and m = 386 + k when using the geographic characteristics of tumors (where parameterized and therefore a tumor is usable)."}, {"heading": "B.

RELATED WORK", "text": "The topics related to disease prediction that are discussed during this work can best be categorized as disease and survival curve prediction and geographical prediction and representation, and there are many previous papers on disease prediction that can be considered classification-based [6] - [12] and survival-based [4], [10], [13] that have historically been used to make such predictions, decision trees [14] and neural network models [4], [15], [16] which are recent developments. However, Laurentiis and Ravdin [17] point out that CPH has several caveats compared to neural network-based approaches."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we investigated the use of two distinct geographical characteristics - a simple binary representation (SBR) and a rich representation based on spectral clustering (which we call spectral analysis and methodically call RR-SA) - to predict patient survival curves in the US state of Iowa. We show that (a) survival curves can be reasonably estimated, although predictive performance varies near the five-year survival mark, (b) the use of geographical characteristics generally leads to better predictions, and (c) RR-SA-trained models are better than those trained with SBR. Future work will include exploring various geographical representations, particularly those learned in conjunction with g-SA. Further research should also be undertaken into areas and scenarios where geographical representations of SBR and RR-SA provide benefits."}, {"heading": "VI.
