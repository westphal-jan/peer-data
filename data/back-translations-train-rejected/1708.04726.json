A compromised biometric offers unlimited risk in privacy (anyone can view the biometric) and authentication (anyone may use the biometric). Standards such as the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS) (IEEE 2410-2016) provide a detailed mechanism to authenticate biometrics based on pre-enrolled devices and a previous identity by storing the biometric in encrypted form. This paper describes a biometric-agnostic approach that addresses the privacy concerns of biometrics through the implementation of BOPS. Specifically, two novel concepts are introduced. First, a biometric is applied to a neural network to create a feature vector.

Encryption", "text": "Since we have little control over devices such as cameras or sensors, the biometric template arrives as plaintext. If we encrypt it immediately and process it only as ciphertext, we have the maximum practical level of privacy. An important part of the offering of this highest level of privacy is a one-way encryption algorithm, which means that there is no mechanism to get to the original plaintext. Many one-way encryption algorithms exist, such as MD5 and SHA-512, but these algorithms are not homorphous. This means that we cannot establish a proximity between two ciphertext vectors with Euclidean measurements. This paper explores and produces a general purpose solution that produces biometric ciphertext encrypted using a neural algorithm."}, {"heading": "A.
