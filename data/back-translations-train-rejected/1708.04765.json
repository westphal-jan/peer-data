BACKGROUD: FUNCTIONAL SEGMENT AND UNITS OF A DIALOGUE", "text": "DAs are augmented by Austin's [10] and Searle's [11] linguistic act theory to model the conversation functions that utterances can execute. It is the meaning of a utterance at the level of illocutionary power, such as statement, question and greeting. Recognition of dialog acts must perform the following: 1) segmentation of human-human dialogues into phrases, 2) intra-turn segmentation within DA boundaries, i.e. functional segment identification, and 3) classification of each segment according to a DA tag [12]. In which \"turn,\" \"dialog act,\" \"functional segment terms are defined slightly differently between different domains and different purposes, but these are standardized and unified in ISO standards as follows: 1https: / / dialogbank.uvt.nl /"}, {"heading": "Turn:", "text": "A \"turn\" is defined as \"a stretch of communicative activity produced by a participant who takes on the role of speaker, limited by periods of time during which another participant takes on the role of speaker.\" Dialogue participants (sender, addressee) usually alternate in conversation. Several statements from one of the dialogs in our corpus are presented as examples of turn, message and function segments in Table I and Table II. In our message data, a turn is considered a collection of continuous messages sent by one participant, defining a message as a group of words sent from one dialog participant to the other. For example, Turn t2 comprises four messages ms2, ms3, ms4, ms5 (Table I)."}, {"heading": "Functional segment:", "text": "A functional segment is the \"minimal extension of communicative behavior that has a communicative function,\" \"minimal in the sense that it does not include material that does not contribute to the expression of the function or semantic content of the act of dialogue.\" [1] A functional segment can be shorter than rotations and continuous, as in Table I, t1, which includes two functional segments fs1 and fs2. A functional segment can be discontinuous, with examples such as fs4 and fs10. fs5 is nested within fs4. Furthermore, functional segment fs10 is combined from two messages, fs8 overlaps fs10. Thus, we can see that a functional segment can be continuous, can be discontinuous, overlap and nested. A detailed explanation of the types of FS is presented in [13] and standard ISO 24617-2."}, {"heading": "Dialog Act:", "text": "DA is \"communicative activity of a dialogue participant, which is interpreted in such a way that it has a certain communicative function and semantic content.\" For example: \"xin ch\u00e0o c\u0441u khoichi\" (\"Hello you are well\") The \"xin ch\u00e0o\" (\"Hello\") is greeting and opening. DA of \"c\u0435u khoichi\" (\"You are well\") is check question."}, {"heading": "III. CORPUS BUILDING: MESSAGE DATA & PHONE DATA", "text": "In Vietnamese, there is no publicly accessible standard corpus. Therefore, we first need to establish a reference corpus for training and evaluation. To do this work, we need to build two corpus of data from human-to-human conversations in different areas: one is chat texts and the other is spoken texts."}, {"heading": "A. Message corpus", "text": "The dataset contains 280 human-Vietnamese dialogues on any topic with a total of 4583 messages. The average length of the dialogs is 16.4 messages. The dataset was independently labeled by three commentators. The match value of our dataset reached 0.87 Fleiss'Kappa measure [14]. As can be seen from our data, there are some challenges as follows: 1) The data is very loud because it contains many acronyms, misspellings, slang and emoticons. This FS identification, but sometimes an FS can contain multiple messages and may even contain only part of a message and part of the next message. This indistinct end of a round also leads to the end of a misleading message. In sudden interruptions messages may fall out of synchronization. Each participant tends to respond to a message earlier than the previous one, causing the conversation to appear out of order and the conversation inconsistent."}, {"heading": "Online chat dictionary", "text": "Our online chat dictionary includes abbreviations, slang, and teen-style (teen code) words such as \"bj\" - \"b\u00e2y gib\" (\"now\"), \"ck\" - \"ch\u0435ng\" (\"husband\"), \"4u\" - \"cho b\u043en\" (\"for you\"). The letters \"c,\" \"k,\" \"q\" are usually replaced by \"k,\" \"ch,\" but often by \"ck...\" Standardizing the message data in the online chat dictionary reduces the background noise of the input data, making it more formal and helping the models function better."}, {"heading": "B. Phone corpus", "text": "The Vietnamese conversations in this corpus include various dialects spoken in the regions of North, North-Central, Central and South Vietnam. We have selected 22 conversations and segment their transcripts into the rotation by hand. Then, the rotations are annotated. Vietnamese conversations in this corpus include 1545 rotations and 3500 FSs with an average of 70 rotations and 160 FSs per conversation. Accordance of telephone data is 0.84 Fleiss'kappa measure. However, FS recognition for spoken texts is more demanding than working with written documents such as: 1) First, spoken text is generally shorter and less grammatical."}, {"heading": "IV. DA SEGMETATION WITH ME, CRF AND BI-LSTM-CRF", "text": "The number of discontinuous or nested function segments represents only a very small percentage in both sets of data (0.5% in the message corpus, 0.9% in the phone corpus), so there are not enough discontinuous or nested function segments so that models can learn to identify them. Therefore, this paper focuses only on the identification of continuous and non-nested function segments (which account for more than 99% of both sets of data). In future studies, we intend to increase the size of our data sets, the number of discontinuous or nested function segments, and study methods for identifying these functional segments. In this essay, we consider the segmentation problem to be a sequential tagging task: the first word of an FS is marked with B _ fs (beginning of an FS), the symbol located within an FS is marked with I _ FS (within an FS), the problem of the syllable identification {is indicated as the problem of the syllable identification of a FS in a set of two sets of syllables}."}, {"heading": "A. Maximum Entropy", "text": "The ME (Maxent) model defines the conditional distribution of class (y) using an observation vector t as an exponential form in formula (1) [15]: P (y / t) = 1Z (t) exp (K \u2211 1 \u03b8k (t, y))) (1), where \u03b8k is an estimated weight parameter for the corresponding trait function fk (t, y) and Z (t) is a normalizing factor across all classes to ensure a reasonable probability. K is the total number of trait functions. We chose ME for evaluation and comparison because it encodes various rich and overlapping traits at different levels of granularity for sparse data such as natural language [16]."}, {"heading": "B. Conditional Random Fields", "text": "The CRFs model also defines the conditional distribution of class (y) using an observation vector t as a form (1) [17], whereby \u03b8k is a weight parameter to be estimated for the corresponding feature function fk (t, y), and Z (t) is a normalizing factor across all classes to ensure an appropriate probability. And K is the total number of feature functions. It is essentially a ME model over the entire sequence. It differs from the Maxent model in that it models sequence information, since the Maxent model decides for each state independently of the other states. For example, transcription works together with class markers used in dialogue for the CRF word recognition model, as follows: Training ME and CRF are usually performed by maximizing the probability function with respect to training data using advanced convex optimization techniques such as L-BGS [18]."}, {"heading": "C. Deep learning\u2013based models with Bi\u2013LSTM\u2013CRF", "text": "The Bi-LSTM CRF network is formed by combining a bi-directional LSTM network and a CRF network. [9] Therefore, the Bi-LSTM CRF network can efficiently use past and future input functions via a Bi-LSTM layer and a CRF layer. A CRF layer is represented by lines connecting successive output levels. A CRF layer has a state transition matrix as parameters. Below are examples of a text in the Bi-LSTM CRF model: BI-LSTM-CRF has proven to be a standard method for determining vector representations that serve as input for various token labeling tasks. We expect that Vietnamese segmentation of dialogue files using the BI-LSTM CRF model will also resemble highly accurate results."}, {"heading": "V. EVALUATION", "text": "The simple lexical attribute, n-gram, n-gram, bigram and trigram, we divide into five parts, which we have used for the ME and CRF models. We do experiments on two different conversation datasets (measurement dataset and telephone dataset) to perform these datasets using local dialect bias and online chat dictionary.Training ME and CRF are often performed by maximizing the probability function with respect to the training data using quasi-Newton methods such as L-BFGS [18]. Thus, in the experiments with ME and CRF, we use L-BFGS method. For CRF models, we use the second order Markov dependence. On experiment with CRF, we use tools: FlexCRFs - a C / C + + implementation of CRFs 3. On experiment with Bi-LSTM-CRF, our setup is based on the investigation of Lample et al. 4].For experiment, we randomly divide each group into five parts for each evaluation."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have presented a thorough study of Vietnamese FS identification using a machine learning approach and a deep learning approach. We have created two commented corpora for evaluation and two dictionaries that make the data sets more consistent and help make the models work better. We have used two machine learning techniques and a deep learning method and compared them with the task of automatic dialogue act segmentation. For the first time, deep learning techniques for dialogue act segmentation are also being used. We also draw some useful conclusions from the experimental results that may be very helpful for future studies. These encouraging results show that the task of identifying functional segments is promising to continue the next steps to identify dialogue files and to understand the intentions in users \"pronouncements for Vietnamese. For future work, we intend to expand the studies in two directions: First, we plan to increase the size of our data set to obtain a sufficient number of types of functional identification and to obtain a solution to a sufficient number of variations in the types of identification."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This work was supported by the project QG.15.29 of the Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU)."}], "references": [{"title": "ISO 24617- 2: A Semantically-Based Standard for Dialogue Annotation.", "author": ["H.
