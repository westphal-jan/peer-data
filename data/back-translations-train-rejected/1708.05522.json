However, enforcing PC is computationally expensive and sometimes even unnecessary. Directional path-consistency (DPC) is a weaker notion of PC that considers a given variable ordering and can thus be enforced more efficiently than PC. This paper shows that DPC (the DPC enforcing algorithm of Dechter and Pearl) decides the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) of a constraint language if it is complete and has the variable elimination property (VEP). However, we also show that no complete VEP constraint language can have a domain with more than 2 values. We then present a simple variant of the DPC algorithm, called DPC*, and show that the CSP of a constraint language can be decided by DPC* if it is closed under a majority operation. In fact, DPC* is sufficient for guaranteeing backtrack-free search for such constraint networks. Examples of majority-closed constraint classes include the classes of connected row-convex (CRC) constraints and tree-preserving constraints, which have found applications in various domains, such as scene labeling, temporal reasoning, geometric reasoning, and logical filtering. Our experimental evaluations show that DPC* significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving majority-closed constraints.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:06:23 GMT  (647kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05522v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["shufeng kong", "sanjiang li", "michael sioutis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05522"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.05522.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Exploring Directional Path-Consistency for Solving Constraint Networks", "authors": ["Shufeng Kong", "Sanjiang Li", "Michael Sioutis"], "emails": ["michael.sioutis@oru.se"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We then present a simple variant of the DPC algorithm, called DPC \u0445, and show that the CSP of a DPC \u0445 constraint language can be decided when it is closed in the context of a majority operation.

In view of a complete binary constraint language, it turns out that DPC CSP can decide when it is defined over domains with less than three values. For a possibly incomplete binary constraint language, we have proven that it has the Helly property when and only when it is consistent for a non-trivially inconsistent and triangulated binary constraint network N over a longer period of time, when it is strongly DPC in relation to the inverse arrangement of a perfect elimination of the constraint diagram of N. The classes of line-convex [3] and tree-convex [35] constraint classes are examples of constraint classes that have the Helly property. More importantly, we have found the DPC algorithm, a simple variant of the constraint language, the Constraint-Constraint-Constraint-Multiple Language, which is sufficient for closed constraints."}], "references": [{"title": "The collapse of the bounded width hierarchy", "author": ["L.

path-consistency (PC) has received a great deal of attention. However, enforcing PC is computationally expensive and sometimes even unnecessary. Directional path-consistency (DPC) is a weaker notion of PC that considers a given variable ordering and can thus be enforced more efficiently than PC. This paper shows that DPC (the DPC enforcing algorithm of Dechter and Pearl) decides the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) of a constraint language \u0393 if it is complete and has the variable elimination property (VEP). However, we also show that no complete VEP constraint language can have a domain with more than 2 values. We then present a simple variant of the DPC algorithm, called DPC\u2217, and show that the CSP of a constraint language can be decided by DPC\u2217 if it is closed under a majority operation. In fact, DPC\u2217 is sufficient for guaranteeing backtrack-free search for such constraint networks. Examples of majority-closed constraint classes include the classes of connected row-convex (CRC) constraints and tree-preserving constraints, which have found applications in various domains, such as scene labeling, temporal reasoning, geometric reasoning, and logical filtering. Our experimental evaluations show that DPC\u2217 significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving majority-closed constraints.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
