Given a record, they do not take into account other objects attributes even though they can provide valuable information for the learning task. In this paper we present GGQ-ID3, a multi-relational decision tree learning algorithm that uses Generalized Graph Queries (GGQ) as predicates in the decision nodes. GGQs allow to express complex patterns (including cycles) and they can be refined step-by-step. Also, they can evaluate structures (not only single records) and perform Regular Pattern Matching. GGQ are built dynamically (pattern mining) during the GGQ-ID3 tree construction process. We will show how to use GGQ-ID3 to perform multi-relational machine learning keeping complexity under control. Finally, some real examples of automatically obtained classification trees and semantic patterns are shown.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 11:19:01 GMT  (1916kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05563v1", "Multi-lingual Paper.

Each object in the training set belongs to a class (usually represented by the value of its target attribute) of a set of mutually exclusive classes. ID3 has been one of the most used techniques in machine learning with applications to tasks as diverse as epidemics prediction, robot control, and automatic classification of clients in banks or insurance entities [19, 18, 7]. The main goal of this work is to offer a methodology that allows to carry out machine learning tasks using decision trees on multi-relational graph data. In this context, the number of possible properties of each object goes far beyond those that it has directly associated, since the properties of the elements that are related to it can also be considered attributes of the object, and even the topological structure formed by the objects in their environment and the various measures that can be taken from the graph structure could be considered as additional attributes. With this objective, we will analyse different techniques that allow automatic induction of decision trees from graph data and we will present our proposal, GGQ-ID3, that aims to provide a framework to classify substructures in a graph, from simple nodes and edges, to larger paths and subgraphs, making use of Generalized Graph Query (GGQ) [1]. This paper is structured as follows: we will start reviewing different techniques of induction of relational decision trees; then, we present our proposal based on the use of Generalized Graph Queries as evaluation tool; once our proposal is presented, we will show some examples of its application; and finally we present some conclusions and future work lines.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
