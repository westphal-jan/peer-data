Such inter-connected objects are referred to as Internet-of-Things (IoT) and/or Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). One example of such a system is based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The fleet of such vehicles are prophesied to take on multiple roles involving mundane to high-sensitive, such as, prompt pizza or shopping deliveries to your homes to battlefield deployment for reconnaissance and combat missions. Drones, as we refer to UAVs in this paper, either can operate individually (solo missions) or part of a fleet (group missions), with and without constant connection with the base station. The base station acts as the command centre to manage the activities of the drones. However, an independent, localised and effective fleet control is required, potentially based on swarm intelligence, for the reasons: 1) increase in the number of drone fleets, 2) number of drones in a fleet might be multiple of tens, 3) time-criticality in making decisions by such fleets in the wild, 4) potential communication congestions/lag, and 5) in some cases working in challenging terrains that hinders or mandates-limited communication with control centre (i.e., operations spanning long period of times or military usage of such fleets in enemy territory). This self-ware, mission-focused and independent fleet of drones that potential utilises swarm intelligence for a) air-traffic and/or flight control management, b) obstacle avoidance, c) self-preservation while maintaining the mission criteria, d) collaboration with other fleets in the wild (autonomously) and e) assuring the security, privacy and safety of physical (drones itself) and virtual (data, software) assets. In this paper, we investigate the challenges faced by fleet of drones and propose a potential course of action on how to overcome them.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 18:41:38 GMT  (1496kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05732v1", "12 Pages, 7 Figures, Conference, The 36th IEEE/AIAA Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC'17)"]], "COMMENTS": "12 Pages, 7 Figures, Conference, The 36th IEEE/AIAA Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC'17)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.AI cs.NE cs.RO", "authors": ["raja naeem akram", "konstantinos markantonakis", "keith mayes", "oussama habachi", "damien sauveron", "reas steyven", "serge chaumette"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05732"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.05732.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Security, Privacy and Safety Evaluation of Dynamic and Static Fleets of Drones", "authors": ["Raja Naeem Akram", "Konstantinos Markantonakis", "Keith Mayes", "Oussama Habachi", "Damien Sauveron", "Andreas Steyven", "Serge Chaumette"], "emails": ["r.n.akram@rhul.ac.uk", "k.markantonakis@rhul.ac.uk", "keith.mayes@rhul.ac.uk", "oussama.habachi@unilim.fr", "damien.sauveron@unilim.fr", "a.steyven@napier.ac.uk,", "serge.chaumette@labri.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "Drone technology is evolving at a breathtaking pace, moving from a toy for hobbyists to a state where both the private and public sectors can rely on it as a tool to provide value-added services to users. [1] The low cost and mobilization time of drones are two key drivers for their deployment. Checking the structural integrity of a building, for example, is much cheaper with drones than with other aviation platforms such as helicopters or high-rise cranes. Similarly, drones can be deployed faster than police helicopters - a potentially attractive feature required by law enforcement agencies. However, drones would most likely not operate separately or in isolation; individual drones can be part of a fleet managed by the same organization, where mission objectives can only be achieved if fleet members cooperate. Additionally, drones from other organizations can be located in airspace where individual drones and fleets must negotiate to operate safely."}, {"heading": "1.1. Context", "text": "There are several ways in which drone fleets can be managed; for example, all decisions could be made by the Fleet Management Authority (also referred to as the Control Centre). This requires drones to communicate information to the Ground Fleet Management System, potentially in real time, and to respond quickly to any instructions received. In certain situations, as discussed previously, drone fleets are likely to act autonomously and should make decisions in flight without requiring explicit permission from a Fleet Management System on the ground. Individual drones with limited computing power may not be suitable for autonomous behavior if it is based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques - limited computing and storage resources along with real-time decision-making requirements only pose challenges. To overcome this limitation, drone fleets may behave like swarms in which AI algorithms designed for the Swarm Intelligence paradigm can be applied. For fleets of drones (referred to as \"Swarm Mines\"), which we specifically refer to as Swarm Mines."}, {"heading": "1.2.

Related Work", "text": "In this section we will discuss related literature from three aspects."}, {"heading": "2.1. Swarm Robotics - Experiencing, Learning and Adaptation", "text": "Swarm intelligence is not a new concept for FoD. Existing literature [23] - [26] has already examined various uses of swarm intelligence in the context of FoD, especially in the case of internal swarm intelligence and route planning. However, it is difficult to find a case in the related literature where swarm intelligence is proposed for all operations from flight control to cybersecurity - as is the case with this paper. The swarm intelligence paradigm was used to optimize and control individual UAVs: In [27], autonomous route planning by learning from a small number of examples. In [28], three-dimensional route planning for a single drone using a bat-inspired algorithm to determine appropriate points in space and apply B-spline curves to improve the smoothness of the path.In [29], authors have introduced and validated a decentralized architecture for search and rescue missions in ground-based robot groups of different sizes."}, {"heading": "2.2. Security, Safety and Privacy of Fleet of Drones", "text": "Since the advent of drones, various solutions have been developed to secure their communications: either a) a single drone that communicates with a GCS (Ground Control Station) or other devices, or b) communication within a FoD. As in [32], attacks on drones are either physical or logical attacks, or attacks on their communication capabilities, all of which can be carried out by a sophisticated adversary."}, {"heading": "2.3. Performance and Energy Consumption", "text": "Energy management is approached at two different levels: with regard to refuelling (fuel or batteries) and with regard to optimising energy consumption during flight. In terms of refuelling, research and experiments are undertaken to provide mechanisms for recharging / refuelling during flight. Standard avionic procedures are used / adapted, but more original approaches are also explored, such as the use of solar panels, laser radiation or ad hoc hosts [42]. In terms of optimising energy consumption during flight, for example, the (internal) monitoring algorithms (the algorithms that control the sensors, the IMU, the autopilot, etc.) can be studied, as can the algorithms used to achieve / implement the missions."}, {"heading": "3. Fleet of Drones - Why?", "text": "Why should FoD be preferred over single, powerful drones? However, as Figure 1 shows, one of the first interests of the fleet is to assemble several smaller drones that can be equipped with different sensors or other equipment that provide redundancy that can help to tolerate some degree of failure. In addition, a variety of drones can cover a larger geographical area than a single one. This can be done in a smarter way, as only drones with useful capabilities to support the mission can be sent to certain areas, while other drones perform other tasks. Nevertheless, a single drone would have to visit each location. FoD can also use the network they form to continue to communicate with the GCS when there are obstacles on the path between some drones and the GCS, simply passing messages to neighboring drones that are able to establish communication with the GCS. Small drones are also interesting because they are more hidden, less noisy than a large drone, but may not be of particular interest to both civilian and military applications."}, {"heading": "3.1.

Fleet Construction", "text": "Based on the conceptual model, the first step in the formation of the SoD is in the pre-mission phase and in the post-mission deformation phase. Therefore, the process of building the fleet consists of two parts: before the mission and after the mission, which are discussed in this section. In the pre-mission phase, the fleet building process begins with the formulation of a mission - with a number of objectives. The mission control unit then creates a mission mission order that includes mission objectives, airspace regulations, ethical principles, safety and privacy policies, organizational obligations, basic configuration (for the first mission) and collaborative knowledge. The mission order is then transmitted to the Ground Flight Management System (GFMS), which would select the drones from the inventory that would participate in the mission based on mission requirements, the availability of the drone and organizational preferences."}, {"heading": "4.3. Types of Swarm of Drones", "text": "In this section, we discuss three types of SoD that can potentially be used depending on the target environment and situation.4.3.1. Static SoD. The most basic type of SoD is static SoD. In this formation, the members of the swarm are pre-selected during the pre-mission phase. No new members can enroll in the swarm during the flight, as the collective is blocked at the point of mission initiation.Secure communication, mutual trust and collaboration are set up by the GFMS of the SoD Owner. Any drone that is either owned or not by the respective SoD Owner is treated during the flight as an external entity of the SoD. Figure 6 shows the static SoD compared to the dynamic SoD discussed in the next paragraph.4.3.2. Dynamic SoD. Unlike a static SoD, a dynamic SoD is open to engaging new members along with existing members who are leaving the SoD."}, {"heading": "4.4. SoD Collaboration Models", "text": "In this section, we discuss three variants of collaboration models for SoD.1) Centralized: In this collaboration model, there is a powerful master drone in SoD that collects all feeds from individual drones and supports the swarm in computing and decision-making. 2) Decentralized: In this collaboration model, there is no single master drone, but a small subset of powerful drones that collect feeds from neighboring drones and then these powerful drones perform collaborative learning, evaluation and decision-making. 3) Distributed (peer-oriented): In this model, all participants in SoD play more or less the same role in all collaborative learning, evaluation and decision-making processes. It can be noted that the activity burden is distributed among the population based on their individual abilities, current performance and power resources, and criticism of their unique characteristics in the overall mission."}, {"heading": "5. Open Challenges of Swarm of Drones", "text": "In this section, we have selected a very short list of outstanding SOD issues, divided into two categories: 1) Security, Privacy and Trust, and 2) Performance and Energy Consumption. The implications and significance of these outstanding issues are listed in Table 1, represented by the number of questions; the higher the number, the more critical this open question is to the success of SOD."}, {"heading": "5.1. Security, Privacy and Trust Related", "text": "SP1 Swarm Authentication, Attestation and Secure Communication: SoDs must negotiate with external entities, including air traffic controllers and other drones (including SoDs). In addition, the inclusion of new drones and the removal of drones leaving the swarm is another challenge. This open issue does not affect static SoD as much as the other two types. SP2 Fair Exchange Services Architecture for Swarm of Drones: When drones participate in a group that supports swarm intelligence-based mechanisms to create a SoD, individual drones should have these synergy effects. This should not tax them to the extent that the single mission is comparatively cost-effective and has a negative impact on the performance and energy of the drone than when they are not participating in the SoD. Fair exchange becomes much more relevant in the case of dynamic and hybrid SoD because the potential changes during the flight swarms and the benefits of joining a SoD are identified."}, {"heading": "5.2. Performance and Energy Consumption", "text": "PE1 Balance cybersecurity with power and energy consumption: As we have seen in Section 1.2.3, the computing power and energy consumption of a drone are strongly influenced by several factors, including the importance of MCOs (including critical event response capabilities), algorithms and data management (encryption for example), all of which must be mitigated with a holistic approach to cybersecurity issues. PE2 Graceful Degradation - Altruism versus SelfishSurvival: Graceful Degradation is, of course, part of the intrinsic management system of any drone. However, in combination with a swarm, this should no longer be considered at the level of a single drone, but at the level of the swarm as a whole. In fact, depending on the mission, it must be decided whether it is more important for each drone to save its own energy / computing power (selfish approach) or whether it cooperates (and thus collectively consumes energy)."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The potential for an independent and autonomous set of drones, whether we call them FoD or SoD, is gradually becoming necessary, especially given the increasing complexity of real-time decision-making by individuals or fleets of drones in crowded and regulated airspace. For such an eventuality, the application of Swarm Intelligence in the field of drones is only a natural evolution of the field. In this paper, we explained the reasons for drone fleets, the need for their independence and autonomy in the wild, and the application of Swarm Intelligence. We also explained a conceptual architecture for integrating Swarm Intelligence as a core function that is not limited to a single function such as traffic management, but controls a wide range of functions and decisions at the individual drone and fleet levels. To support this conceptual architecture, we also listed various types and collaborative models of SoD, as well as open questions whose solutions are critical to the success of the application of Swarm Intelligence as the core function of the FoDs."}], "references": [{"title": "Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS): Commercial outlook for a new industry", "author": ["B.

One stand-out example are those systems based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Fleets of such vehicles (drones) are prophesied to assume multiple roles from mundane to high-sensitive applications, such as prompt pizza or shopping deliveries to the home, or to deployment on battlefields for battlefield and combat missions. Drones, which we refer to as UAVs in this paper, can operate either individually (solo missions) or as part of a fleet (group missions), with and without constant connection with a base station. The base station acts as the command centre to manage the drones\u2019 activities; however, an independent, localised and effective fleet control is necessary, potentially based on swarm intelligence, for several reasons: 1) an increase in the number of drone fleets; 2) fleet size might reach tens of UAVs; 3) making time-critical decisions by such fleets in the wild; 4) potential communication congestion and latency; and 5) in some cases, working in challenging terrains that hinders or mandates limited communication with a control centre, e.g. operations spanning long period of times or military usage of fleets in enemy territory. This self-aware, mission-focused and independent fleet of drones may utilise swarm intelligence for a), air-traffic or flight control management, b) obstacle avoidance, c) self-preservation (while maintaining the mission criteria), d) autonomous collaboration with other fleets in the wild, and e) assuring the security, privacy and safety of physical (drones itself) and virtual (data, software) assets. In this paper, we investigate the challenges faced by fleet of drones and propose a potential course of action on how to overcome them.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
