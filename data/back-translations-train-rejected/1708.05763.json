However, many of the corpora used in these studies are based on naturalistic text and thus do not contain many of the low-frequency syntactic constructions that are often required to distinguish processing theories. Here we describe a new corpus consisting of English texts edited to contain many low-frequency syntactic constructions while still sounding fluent to native speakers. The corpus is annotated with hand-corrected parse trees and includes self-paced reading time data. Here we give an overview of the content of the corpus and release the data.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 21:27:34 GMT  (393kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05763v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["richard futrell", "edward gibson", "hal tily", "idan blank", "anastasia vishnevetsky", "steven t piantadosi", "evelina fedorenko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05763"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.05763.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Natural Stories Corpus", "authors": ["Richard Futrell", "Edward Gibson", "Hal Tily", "Idan Blank", "Anastasia Vishnevetsky", "Steven T.

Currently, the most prominent psycholinguistic corpus for English is the Dundee Corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003), which contains 51,501 word marks in 2,368 sentences from British newspaper editorials, along with eye-tracking data from 10 participants. A dependency analysis of the corpus is performed in Barrett et al.

The stories were developed by A.V., E.F., E.G., and S.P. by evaluating and editing existing publicly available texts to use many subject and object extracted relative clauses, columns, topicalized structures, extrapolated relative clauses, penalty points, sentence complements, local structural ambiguities (especially NP / Z ambiguities), idioms, and related clauses with a variety of coherence relationships. The original texts are in Table 1. The mean number of lexical words per sentence is 21.1, roughly the same as the Dundee corpus (21.7). Figure 1 shows a histogram of sentence length in Natural Stories compared to Dundee. The word and sentence count for each story in Table 1. The number of lexical words per sentence is 21.1, roughly the same as the length of the Dundee corpus (1.7)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Parses", "text": "Texts were automatically analyzed with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and corrected by hand.

For each subject, we correlated the Spearman correlation of the RTs of that subject to a story with the average RTs of all other subjects to that story. Thus, for each story, we obtain one ISC statistic per subject. Figure 4 shows histograms of these statistics per story."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Psycholinguistic Sanity Checks", "text": "To validate our RT data, we investigated whether the known effects of frequency, word length, and surprise value (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008; Smith and Levy, 2013) had an effect on RTs. To do this, for each of the three predictors log frequency, log trigram probability, and word length, we fit a linear mixed-effect regression model with subject and history as random intercepts (models with random slopes did not converge) predicting RT. Frequency and trigram probabilities were calculated from Google Books N-gram and add up over years from 1990 to 2013. (These counts are also published with this data set.) Results of regressions are presented in Table 3; we report on the results of the maximum convergence model. In accordance with well-known ef effects, both increased frequency and increased probability lead to faster reading times, and word length to slower reading times."}, {"heading": "3.4 Syntactic Constructions", "text": "Here we give an overview of the low frequency or marked syntactical constructions that occur in the stories. We coded sentences in the Natural Stories corpus for the presence of a number of marked constructions, and also coded 200 randomly selected sentences from the Dundee corpus for the same characteristics. The coded features are listed and explained in Appendix A. Figure 5 shows the frequency of these marked constructions per sentence in the two corpus. The figure shows that the natural stories exhibit a particularly high rate of non-local VP conjunction, non-strictive SRCs, idioms, adjective conjunction, non-canonical ORCs, local NP / S ambiguities, and columns."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "We have described a new psycholinguistic corpus of English, consisting of edited naturalistic text that contains many rare or difficult-to-process constructions while still sounding fluent. We believe that this corpus will be an important part of a series of test sets for psycholinguistic models that reveal their behavior in unusual constructions in ways that fully naturalistic corpus cannot. We also hope that the corpus described here will form the basis for further data collection and annotation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the NSF DDRI Grant # 1551543 to R.F., NSF Fellowships # 0844472 and # 1534318 to E.G., and the NIH Career Development Award HD057522 to E.F.

However, many of the corpora used in these studies are based on naturalistic text and thus do not contain many of the low-frequency syntactic constructions that are often required to distinguish processing theories. Here we describe a new corpus consisting of English texts edited to contain many low-frequency syntactic constructions while still sounding fluent to native speakers. The corpus is annotated with hand-corrected parse trees and includes self-paced reading time data.
