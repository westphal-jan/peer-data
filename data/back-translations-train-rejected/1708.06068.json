Knowledge of the sociolect aspects of the user paves the way for enriching the performance of referral systems, targeted Internet advertising, consumer behavior analysis and forensic science. 2. The work focuses on the incorporation of sociolectic aspects, such as gender and language variation (native language), from the user's tweets by citing their word usage as evidence [8]. 3. The author profile task is to predict the gender and language variation from their tweets, which are 100 in number. 4. This task can be considered a text classification, considering the sociolectic aspects of the author as sociolectical aspects that consider their sociolective aspects and their text as their tweets."}, {"heading": "2 Text Representation - Vector Space Model", "text": "The vector space model is based on the documents provided. These document sets are processed to find their equivalent optimized numerical representation in matrix format.D = d1, d2, d3,..., dn (1) Here d represents the sentences or documents (here tweets), D represents its equivalent matrix format (here DTM), and n is the total number of documents.The most common methods used under VSM are Document - Term Matrix (DTM) and Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency Matrix (TF-IDF). These methods are commonly referred to as Bag of Word (BOW) methods and follow the word hypothesis [6]. In our methodology, TF-IDF is not taken into account because control of document frequency and term meaning is modelled by the minimum document frequency e."}, {"heading": "3 Feature Learning", "text": "In this thesis, the frequency of the word in the entire document (document frequency) is taken as a threshold to limit the number of unique words in the vocabulary in order to create the custom term matrix. [6] The term matrix in the vocabulary is limited by the frequency of the document. Therefore, the matrix thus generated can be considered a user - feature matrix. In the generated matrix, the line refers to the user and the column to the word used by the user. The following feature scaling table provides a comparison between the number of words in the user term matrix and the user - feature matrix."}, {"heading": "4 Classification", "text": "This experiment focuses not on classification, but on the representation of text. Therefore, the user feature matrix is used along with the corresponding target classes to train the classifier of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Base Function (RBF) as the kernel. SVM is a well-known, non-probable classification algorithm, which is most commonly used to perform the VSM-based representations [7]. SVM with the default parameter in the Scikit Learn library is used directly to create the classifier (i.e. C = 1.0, degree = 3, gamma = 'auto', kernel = 'rbf')."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments and Observations", "text": "This experiment is carried out using a machine with an Intel i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. The data set contains 100 tweets per author and these tweets are written in 4 different languages. Within these different languages, the user's native language is also different. Detailed statistics on the data set used are given in PAN 2017 Author Profiling Overview Paper [1]. The number of variations in the native language is shown in Data - Set Statistics Table. These 100 tweets per author are embedded in an xml file and specified with the truth file containing the gender and language variation class of the respective author. These xml files are issued by xml Python library 5 as document object model and tweets. These 100 tweets per author are then linked to form a single document per author."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The use of words by users in cognitive space was represented by Document - Term Matrix as Vector Space Model. By considering the use of words as a characteristic, a further classification was carried out using the Support Vector Machine. The observed results achieved an average accuracy of almost 70% in both tasks in different languages. Based on the assumptions made, these primary results are satisfactory and that Vector Space Model can be considered as a cognitive space of the user. Accuracy of the system can be enriched by displaying the tweets using the Vector Space Models of Semantics (distributed and distributed representation methods). Our further experiments will aim to derive the vector space models of semantics for modeling the cognitive space of the user from the representation method used in this paper."}], "references": [{"title": "Overview of the 5th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2017: Gender and Language Variety Identification in Twitter", "author": ["Rangel", "Francisco", "Paolo Rosso", "Martin Potthast", "Benno Stein"], "venue": "Working Notes Papers of the CLEF", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2017}, {"title": "Distributional Semantic Representation for Text Classification and Information Retrieval", "author": ["HB Barathi Ganesh", "M Anand Kumar", "KP.
