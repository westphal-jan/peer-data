Research in the areas of Transcultural Care and Culturally Competent Health Care forms the theoretical basis of CARESSES and paves the way for the development of culturally competent robots. The robot's attitude towards users was initially created on the basis of available data on the dimensions of Hofstede [13], supplemented by specific information on the cultural group of users. This allowed preliminary assumptions about the expected behaviour of a culturally competent robot, described in terms of Cultural Awareness, Cultural Knowledge and Cultural Sensitivity [23]."}, {"heading": "4.1 Initial scenarios", "text": "In order to arrive at a number of technical requirements, we have based the above concepts on concrete examples summarised in Tables 1, 2 and 3, which describe possible scenarios of interaction between a culturally competent assistant robot and an elderly person. Scenarios are written by experts in transcultural care and refer to the fundamentals and actions of culturally competent caregivers. Each table reports on a pattern of sensorimotor and / or verbal interaction, the required robotic skills and cultural competence (in terms of cultural awareness, cultural knowledge and cultural sensitivity) that can help determine the robot's behavior."}, {"heading": "4.2 Elicitation of guidelines", "text": "In order to base the assumptions on observations in real-life scenarios, the cultural competence of the robot is now undergoing a process of iterative refinement based on the cultural behaviors gathered from videotaped encounters between elderly people living in sheltered shelters and their caregivers. Once the relevant verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been identified and verified, an expert panel will refine the assumption and update the cultural competence of the robot prototype, taking great care to eliminate stereotypical notions [19]. This process will ultimately produce guidelines describing how culturally competent robots should behave in assistive scenarios. The knowledge acquired in all these steps, both through comprehensive literature reviews on the topics and through video recordings, will be formalized using tools for knowledge representation, since the availability of formal languages for the representation of knowledge forms the basis for enabling the robot to actualize autonomous ways of thinking, its planning, and ultimately its dependence on cultural capabilities in such contexts."}, {"heading": "5 Technical solutions", "text": "From a technological point of view, the first step of CARESSES was to (i) identify the basic technical skills required for cultural competence and (ii) define a system architecture that will allow these skills to be integrated into a fully autonomous assistance robot that may be embedded in an intelligent environment."}, {"heading": "5.1 System architecture", "text": "Figure 3 shows the main modules of the CARESSES architecture: the Cultural Knowledge Base, the Culturally-sensitive Planning & Execution, and the culturally-aware Human-Robot Interaction, which will be briefly described in the next sub-sections. All components will be integrated into universAAL [10], a software platform for open distributed systems that has emerged from a consolidation process within the framework of an EU project. The universal AAL platform enables the seamless integration of heterogeneous components within an environmental network by making full use of two basic concepts that prove to be very suitable for integrating components developed by different partners in a complex RTD project: (i) the use of ontologies to define the services of network nodes and the procedures and data formats for accessing such services; (ii) the use of three dedicated communication buses for theme-based communication between network nodes, namely a context bus and a user interface."}, {"heading": "5.2 Cultural Knowledge Base", "text": "It is important that people are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move"}, {"heading": "5.3 Culturally-Sensitive Planning and Execution", "text": "In fact, the three robots in Tables 1, 2 and 3 have the same goal, but they can achieve this goal with other plans, which may include different measures (for example, Aristotle ordering food online), while the other parties have the same goal."}, {"heading": "5.4 Culture-aware Human-Robot Interaction", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the robot is able to unfold its cultural potential."}, {"heading": "6 Evaluation strategy", "text": "In fact, it is so that most people are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want. \"And further:\" It is not as if, \"he says,\" as if. \"\" It is as if. \"\" It is as if. \"\" It is as if. \"\" It is as if. \"\" It is. \"\" It is as if. \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \".\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \""}, {"heading": "7 Current status and future work", "text": "The first steps in the right direction can be seen in the United States and in Europe, both in the United States and in the United States.

In this article, we discussed the concept of cultural competition put forward in the context of the joint EU-Japan project CARESSES. We gave an overview of the project, discussed the problems it has to solve, discussed its methodology and outlined its first steps. To our knowledge, CARESSES is the first attempt to build culturally competent robots. We believe that cultural competence is a necessary, hitherto insufficiently studied component for any social, personal or assistive robot. In this regard, we are convinced that CARESSES is a ground-breaking project. Even though CARESSES only produces a prototype that needs to be further evaluated and refined before we can assess the impact of our pilot studies on reliability with regard to the final evaluation of robots."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The CARESSES project is supported by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Funding Agreement No 737858 and the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications."}], "references": [{"title": "Effects of culture on the credibility of robot speech: A comparison between english and arabic", "author": ["Sean Andrist", "Micheline Ziadee", "Halim Boukaram", "Bilge Mutlu", "Majd Sakr"], "venue": "HRI", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2015}, {"title": "The description logic handbook: Theory, implementation and applications", "author": ["Franz Baader"], "venue": "Cambridge university press,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2003}, {"title": "A framework for culture-aware robots based on fuzzy logic", "author": ["Barbara Bruno", "Fulvio Mastrogiovanni", "Federico Pecora", "Antonio Sgorbissa", "Alessandro Saffiotti"], "venue": "In IEEE Int Conf on Fuzzy Systems,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2017}, {"title": "Using fuzzy logic to enhance classification of human motion primitives", "author": ["Barbara Bruno", "Fulvio Mastrogiovanni", "Alessandro Saffiotti", "Antonio Sgorbissa"], "venue": "In Int Conf on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Development of an instrument measuring user satisfaction of the human-computer interface", "author": ["J.P.
