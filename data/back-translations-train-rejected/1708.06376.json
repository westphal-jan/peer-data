By capturing traffic traces between users and their Tor entry guard, a network eavesdropper can leverage this meta-data to reveal which website Tor users are visiting. The success of such attacks heavily depends on the particular set of traffic features that are used to construct the fingerprint. Typically, these features are manually engineered and, as such, any change introduced to the Tor network can render these carefully constructed features ineffective. In this paper, we show that an adversary can automate the feature engineering process, and thus automatically deanonymize Tor traffic by applying our novel method based on deep learning. We evaluate our approach on a dataset comprised of more than three million network traces, which is the largest dataset of web traffic ever gathered for website fingerprinting, and find that the performance achieved by deep learning techniques is comparable to known approaches which include various research efforts spanning over multiple years. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for feature design and selection which is a tedious work and has been one of the main focus of prior work. We conclude that the ability to automatically construct the most relevant traffic features and perform accurate traffic recognition makes our deep learning based approach an efficient, flexible and robust technique for website fingerprinting.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 18:32:08 GMT  (461kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06376v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["vera rimmer", "davy preuveneers", "marc juarez", "tom van goethem", "wouter joosen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.06376"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.06376.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Automated Feature Extraction for Website Fingerprinting through Deep Learning", "authors": ["Vera Rimmer", "Davy Preuveneers", "Marc Juarez", "Tom Van Goethem", "Wouter Joosen"], "emails": ["firstname.lastname@cs.kuleuven.be", "marc.juarez@esat.kuleuven.be"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is one of the greatest bondages the world has ever seen."}, {"heading": "II. BACKGROUND", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to decide for themselves what they want."}, {"heading": "III. THREAT MODEL", "text": "In this paper, we look at an opponent similar to the one considered in previous work in the WF, namely a passive and local opponent at the network level. Figure 1 shows an overview of this WF scenario. A passive opponent records only network packets transmitted during communication and must not modify or drop them, and must not insert new packets into the packet stream. A local opponent has a limited view of the network. In Tor, in particular, such an opponent typically has the entry node to the Tor network (also known as an input guard) or has access to the connection between the client and the entry. Examples of entities having this degree of visibility range from Internet Service Providers (ISP), autonomous systems (AS), or even local network administrators. Note that an opponent who owns the input guards can decrypt the input guards, the first layer of encryption and access to Tor protocol messages can open the Cypher world, we assume that the traffic from the ISP, the ISP, can open the Cypher world immediately."}, {"heading": "IV. DATA COLLECTION", "text": "One of the prerequisites for deep learning is an abundance of training data needed to truly learn the underlying patterns. Processing sufficient quantities of representative data allows the deep neural network to not only accurately identify the identifiers, but also better generalize to invisible test instances. In previous work on fingerprinting websites in the context of Tor, the data sets collected are relatively small, both in terms of classes (i.e. the number of unique websites) and instances (i.e. the number of traffic traces per website). To properly evaluate our proposed deep learning approach and examine how existing models can benefit from additional training data, we have used a distributed setup to collect various new data sets that meet these requirements."}, {"heading": "A. Data collection methodology", "text": "For data collection, we used 15 virtual machines on our OpenStack-based private cloud environment; each VM was provided with 4 CPUs and 4 GB of RAM; each VM was assigned 16 worker threads, each with its own gate process (version 0.2.8.11); site visit tasks, consisting of starting Tor browser (version 6.5) and loading the destination web page, were then distributed among the 240 simultaneous worker threads; web pages were given 285 seconds to load before the browser was killed and the visit was declared invalid; when the page was uploaded, it was opened for another 10 seconds, then the browser was closed and all profile information was removed; by using network namespaces and tcpdump, we isolated and recorded traffic from each gate process; due to memory constraints, and because the packets are payloads encrypted, we extract no value for the opponent, we extract metadata from the traffic and data encryption."}, {"heading": "B.

Ethical considerations & data access", "text": "For our data-gathering experiments, we conducted about 4 million page views through Tor. It is highly unlikely that this would have an impact on the top sites, which each receive several million requests per day. We also think the impact on the Tor network is limited: the Tor project estimates that during the time we conducted our experiments, about 2 million clients were connected to the Tor network at the same time. Therefore, the 240 clients we used are only a small fraction of the total number of active clients. In addition, we plan to make all records publicly available once this paper is adopted, so that other researchers can evaluate other approaches without having to collect new data samples."}, {"heading": "V.

DISCUSSION", "text": "In this section, we offer some critical reflections and discuss remaining open challenges both in terms of the threat model and the deep learning methods we used in this work. As in virtually all previous work on WF, we analyzed the attacks only when visiting homepages and omitted other pages within the websites we classified. However, we recognize this as an unrealistic assumption. However, since our main goal was to make a fair comparison with existing attacks, we used the same experimental settings. As the models developed in previous work were specifically tailored to these specific settings, the evaluation of techniques that WF takes into account on internal websites was considered out of reach for this paper. Nevertheless, we find automatic features that represent a promising approach for future work to address this issue. We do not attempt to approximate the probability of visiting a website in the closed world versus a website in our experiments. We assume that all open world sites have the same probability of previous sites and all previous sites have the same probability and all the probability."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "We show that deep neural networks are capable of fingerprinting web pages with an accuracy comparable to the best-performing approaches among numerous research efforts in recent years. \u2022 CNN is the fastest network in terms of fewer learnable parameters and has shown the best strengths and weaknesses in the context of WF: \u2022 SDAE has overall proven to be the most stable DNN in terms of the closed world. \u2022 CNN is the fastest network in terms of fewer learnable parameters and showed the best performance for smaller closed worlds and for evaluating the open world. However, this DNN has a higher risk of being overloaded, as revealed by the larger closed worlds and the concept of drift experiments. \u2022 LSTM performed the slowest, but exhibited the best generalization capabilities due to its inadequate structure."}, {"heading": "A.

Convolutional Neural Network", "text": "A deep network called the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is another feedback network that is built with back propagation similar to SDAE, but has a very different structure that requires minimal pre-processing [22]. CNN uses a linear operation called Convolution on some of its layers instead of regular matrix multiplication, the network layer applies Convolution to a multidimensional array of input data and outputs a multidimensional array of learnable parameters called cores or feature maps, as shown in Figure 10. It is applied spatially to small regions of input, allowing for sparse connectivity and reducing actual parameter learning compared to fully connected layers. Each kernel aims to learn a single part of an underlying set of features, such as the fingerprint of the website in a traffic trace."}, {"heading": "C. Long-Short Term Memory", "text": "Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a network with feedback connections that allow it to learn time dependencies [19]. RNN can interpret the input as a sequence, taking into account its temporal characteristics. Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), shown in Figure 11, is a special type of RNN that houses so-called LSTM units to model long-term memory, allowing the network to learn longer input sequences. LSTM units process sequences step by step by passing the data through their memory cells, and give, output and forget gates, as shown in Figure 12. The memory cell represents the so-called internal state. LSTM is able to remove or add information, which regulates these operations by Gates. Gates are composed of a sigmoid neural network layer and a pointing product."}], "references": [{"title": "Fingerprinting attack on tor anonymity using deep learning", "author": ["Kota Abe", "Shigeki Goto"], "venue": "Proceedings of the Asia-Pacific Advanced Network,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Making a science of model search: Hyperparameter optimization in hundreds of dimensions for vision architectures", "author": ["James Bergstra", "Daniel Yamins", "David Cox"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Machine Learning,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2013}, {"title": "ImageHash. https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/ imagehash, 2017", "author": ["Johannes Buchner"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2017}, {"title": "CS-BuFLO: A Congestion Sensitive Website Fingerprinting Defense", "author": ["Xiang Cai", "Rishab Nithyanand", "Rob Johnson"], "venue": "In Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES),", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2014}, {"title": "A Systematic Approach to Developing and Evaluating Website Fingerprinting Defenses", "author": ["Xiang Cai", "Rishab Nithyanand", "Tao Wang", "Rob Johnson", "Ian Goldberg"], "venue": "In ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS),", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Touching from a Distance: Website Fingerprinting Attacks and Defenses", "author": ["Xiang Cai", "Xin Cheng Zhang", "Brijesh Joshi", "Rob Johnson"], "venue": "In ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS),", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Similarity estimation techniques from rounding algorithms", "author": ["Moses S Charikar"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the thiry-fourth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Traffic Analysis of SSL Encrypted Web Browsing", "author": ["Heyning Cheng", "Ron Avnur"], "venue": "Project paper, University of Berkeley,", "citeRegEx": "9", "shortCiteRegEx": "9", "year": 1998}, {"title": "Website Fingerprinting Defenses at the Application Layer", "author": ["Giovanni Cherubin", "Jamie Hayes", "Marc Juarez"], "venue": "In Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS),", "citeRegEx": "10", "shortCiteRegEx": "10", "year": 2017}, {"title": "Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router", "author": ["Roger Dingledine", "Nick Mathewson", "Paul F.

the network traffic that is generated by a visit to a website over Tor reveals information specific to the website through the timing and sizes of network packets. By capturing traffic traces between users and their Tor entry guard, a network eavesdropper can leverage this meta-data to reveal which website Tor users are visiting. The success of such attacks heavily depends on the particular set of traffic features that are used to construct the fingerprint. Typically, these features are manually engineered and, as such, any change introduced to the Tor network can render these carefully constructed features ineffective. In this paper, we show that an adversary can automate the feature engineering process, and thus automatically deanonymize Tor traffic by applying our novel method based on deep learning. We evaluate our approach on a dataset comprised of more than three million network traces, which is the largest dataset of web traffic ever gathered for website fingerprinting, and find that the performance achieved by deep learning techniques is comparable to known approaches which include various research efforts spanning over multiple years. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for feature design and selection which is a tedious work and has been one of the main focus of prior work. We conclude that the ability to automatically construct the most relevant traffic features and perform accurate traffic recognition makes our deep learning based approach an efficient, flexible and robust technique for website fingerprinting.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
