INTRODUCTIONAccording to almost all demographic projections, the population of older adults will increase worldwide in the coming decades [31]. However, if current trends in social and technological development continue, this new population of older adults will be healthier, wealthier and more mobile than any other cohort of older adults in recorded history [34], meaning that they will have more time, resources and skills to participate in tourism and travel, both at home and abroad, as well as in online communities. According to recent research on older adult tourism and online community activities, these two types of activities offer many positive effects for older adults. Tourism can improve overall well-being [23], as the way older adults deal with health problems [7], while community activities have many positive psychological effects on older adults [35]."}, {"heading": "A. Research contribution & research question", "text": "The following detailed research questions will be answered: \u2022 What dimensions of social and individual activity are present in the online communities of older adult tourists. \u2022 How do older tourists differ from other online tourist communities based on the aforementioned mentions? These research questions can be translated into the following hypotheses: \u2022 Hypothesis I: Tourists aged 50 + mention their age more often than members of other groups. \u2022 Hypothesis IV: Tourists aged 50 + speak more often about their limitations and barriers than residents of other groups. \u2022 Hypothesis III: Tourists aged 50 + remember their previous experiences when travelling more often. \u2022 Hypothesis IV: Tourists aged 50 + more often associate their experiences of limitations and barriers with their age. The choice of these hypotheses is based on a number of assumptions derived from available literature."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Older adults as tourists - constraints and limitations", "text": "A study by Collia [5], which analyzed the travel patterns of older US citizens, would be a prime example. Other examples include the work of Nyaupane [29]. Such general overviews of travel patterns of older adults were not limited to the US, but were also attempted among other places in Poland by Omelan [30] and China by Gu [12]. Both studies focused on differences within older adults demographically, with the study by Omelan finding differences in place of residence (rural versus urban), and the study by Gu analyzing the effects of well-being, sex and social status on older adults travel patterns through logistic regression. Studies in this category often show a positive correlation between different measures of psychological and physical well-being and travel, as in studies by Ferri [7] and Ferrer [6].Another line of research in this category are Chinese studies on perception of older adults."}, {"heading": "B. Older adults and on-line communities", "text": "Important work on this topic was done by Nimrod, who not only managed to carry out quantitative analyses to discover specific clusters within older adult communities (information exchangers, age-oriented socialisers) [27], using content analysis tools to extract topics that were predominantly discussed in older online forums [25], but also through online surveys that identified psychological benefits of participating in online communities [28]. There were also studies, such as those by Kowalik and Nielek, that focused on communities of older programmers [20]. Another strand of research focused on barriers to participation in online communities. Research such as that by Gibson [11] and Jaeger [15] found that privacy and accessibility issues are one of the biggest barriers. Also noteworthy is the research by Lazar [21], which, by analysing blog contributions from older adults aged 50 +, showed how people within the community are combating their own identity and addressing.18"}, {"heading": "C. Age, aging, ageism", "text": "Another factor that is important in creating a framework for understanding the experiences of older tourists is the perception of the age of older adults, both for themselves, older adults and from the perspective of others. In the context of senior tourism, research such as that of Cleaver [4] shows that the perception of one's own age is correlated with one's own particular motivations for travelling, whereas Ylanne's work [38] presents the role of age perception in travel agencies as an important factor."}, {"heading": "D. Automated information extraction in the tourist domain", "text": "The authors have already mentioned the recent work of Gu [12], which extracts travel tips from travel reports. Further current research in this area is represented by Bhatnagar, who also proposed a framework for extracting more subtle, if more general and simple aspects of travel experiences, as well as a study on a method for mapping data related to medical tourism in South Korea, which was carried out by [14]."}, {"heading": "III. STUDY DESIGN", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Collected data", "text": "In order to design the framework and develop its applications, we have decided to collect textual data from a single related source, namely the \"Elderly Traveller\" forum on the Lonely Planet website. In total, over 30,000 posts from the last 15 years of the forum's existence have been collected in a single database to serve as a basis for future tests and comments. Compared to previous attempts to analyze tourism among older adults, these data sets will provide a significantly larger amount of data that will be collected and analyzed due to their sheer size. However, the paper presented here focuses on preparatory work in preparing an annotation protocol, only a fraction (100 posts) being used for the current coding and content analysis of tasks. This fraction, like all posts from the forum used in this study, were randomly selected and with a simple random sampling."}, {"heading": "B. Literature review", "text": "In order to verify the dimensions of the framework, a literature review was conducted in accordance with the guidelines described in [22]. Initially, a v was performed to learn the most consistent topics related to the experiences of older adults online in general and older travelers in general; the topics thus extracted are presented in Appendix I."}, {"heading": "C. Coding", "text": "To accomplish the task, a special software called QDA MINER LITE (version 2.0.1) was used. A group of commentators was selected for the task and briefed on the tagging protocol, with each post read by two commentators to mark whether or not the extracted topics appeared in a particular post. During the coding task, the commentators discussed any discrepancies in their tagging function, and the conclusions of this discussion were later applied to the codebook. Once the coding was complete and all discrepancies were resolved, the tagging agreement was calculated using Cohen's Kappa, and the score (83%) indicated a high degree of agreement between the participants."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive on their own are not able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK", "text": "By conducting the literature review and a coding task complemented by an analysis of the codes, the authors planned to better understand which aspects of the dynamics of older online tourist communities are persistent, and demanded more attention in designing a framework for automated mapping and extraction of knowledge from an unstructured text created by an online community. Analysis of the data leads to non-trivial conclusions regarding the nature of online communities of older adults. First, the role of age or perception of it exists in a complex relationship with other aspects of the community. Although perception of age is an important part of the community of older adult tourists, it is not, at least when explicitly addressed to the problems they have while traveling, there is no difference between the Adult Mentions and other aspects of the community."}, {"heading": "VI.

community of senior tourists. By using tools of qualitative analysis as well as review of literature, we managed to verify a set of hypotheses related to the content created by senior tourists when participating in on-line communities. We also produced a codebook, representing various themes one may encounter in such communities. This codebook, derived from our own qualitative research, as well a literature review will serve as a basis for further development of automated tools of knowledge extraction. We also managed to find that older adults more often than other poster in tourists forums, mention their age in discussion, more often share their experiences and motivation to travel, however they do not differ in relation to describing barriers encountered while traveling.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
