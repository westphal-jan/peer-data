BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Background", "text": "In order to find representative scenarios and define practicable test methods, accident data were examined. In order to perform the resulting evaluation tests, an advanced driving robot is required in the test vehicle to achieve repetition accuracy and the necessary precision and accuracy. In addition, a soft target with its own drive system acts as a sensor stimulus for the function to be tested [6]. In specific use cases, such as traffic jams or motorway journeys, transverse and longitudinal functions are combined to achieve a higher level of automation by simultaneously controlling steering and acceleration / deceleration. In order to discuss the different challenges at different levels of automation, which range from zero to full automation, various standardisation bodies have defined a limited number of levels and their significance. In this paper, we use the definition of automation levels proposed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (Sayar) (Say7)."}, {"heading": "B. Related Work:", "text": "The success of automated road vehicles depends on several aspects, some of which are testing, verification, validation and certification. [8] - [13] Existing work indicates that relevant test scenarios and systematic evaluation approaches need to be defined for the evaluation of automated vehicles. As field tests become impractical due to the long kilometers to be driven [12], [14] the majority of tests need to be carried out using simulations or virtual test drives [15], the results of which are validated on test benches or in field tests. Virtual tests can also help identify other relevant test scenarios [16], and the number of tests to be performed can be reduced by combinatorial tests [17]. Test tracks need to complement the tests by orchestrating multiple automated actors involved in one scenario [18]. In highly automated vehicles, the transfer [19] between driver and vehicle and vice versa [8] becomes crucial to avoid problems such as confusion and unfair transitions."}, {"heading": "III.

Therefore, the analysis of related literature is considered a final step and our results are compared with their findings. We identified ten papers that are considered to be the most relevant for testing automated vehicles [8] - [17]. We compare whether and which of the challenges we have identified from our interviews and focus groups will be presented in these ten publications.

The conclusion from the comparison is that all the challenges identified in this paper are addressed in at least one of the other papers. Virtual testing and simulation is the most common challenge in the literature and in our study. Similarly, development processes and artificial intelligence / self-adaptation testing are the least common challenges. However, there are a few discrepancies: sensor and sensor modeling and test automation are more common in the literature than in our study. In contrast, V2X communication is a more common challenge in our study than in the literature. Table II summarizes these results by an adjusted ranking based on the average of both results: our study results and challenges addressed in the 10 publications examined."}, {"heading": "VI. THREATS TO VALIDITY", "text": "The challenges presented do not necessarily relate to new areas of research, nor to an exhaustive description of all existing challenges. Rather, our work aims to focus the industrial and academic view on important gaps. For example, the issue of security issues was not discussed, but some commercial approaches were already presented, but focused on the three stakeholder groups (i.e., suppliers and researchers), as the topic was already very broad and we did not cover all stakeholders in this ecosystem. Thus, we were able to focus on the three stakeholder groups (i.e., suppliers and researchers)."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We have presented an empirical study on the challenges of testing automated vehicles and compared our findings with the challenges identified in the 2016 literature as this topic is attracting increasing research attention, with the main challenges identified being 1) virtual testing and simulation, 2) safety, reliability and quality, 3) sensors and their models, 4) required scenarios, complexity and number of test cases, and 5) driver-vehicle transfer and shifting responsibility to the vehicle.
