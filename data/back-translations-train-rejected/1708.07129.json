BACKGROUND ON TRADITIONAL ACTIVITY RECOGNITION SYSTEMS", "text": "HUMAN activity recognition has gained tremendous traction in recent years due to numerous applications aimed at monitoring people's movement and behavior indoors. Applications such as health monitoring and fall detection for the elderly [1], contextual awareness, activity detection for energy efficiency in smart homes [2] and many other Internet of Things (IoT) based applications [3].In existing systems, individuals must wear a device equipped with motion sensors such as gyroscopes and accelerometers. Sensor data is processed locally on the portable device or transferred to a server for function extraction and then monitored learning algorithms are used for classification. This type of monitoring is known as active monitoring. The performance of such a system is shown to be 90% capable of detecting activities such as sleeping, sitting, walking, walking and running."}, {"heading": "A. Techniques Based on Wi-Fi Signal Power", "text": "The received signal strength (RSS) has been successfully used for active localization of wireless devices using WiFi fingerprint techniques, as summarized in [5]. RSS has also been used as a measurement for passive tracking of mobile objects [6]. If the person is located between the WiFi device and the access point (AP), the signal is attenuated and thus another RSS is observed. Although RSS is very easy to use and easily measurable, it cannot capture the real changes in the signal due to the movement of the person. This is because the RSS is not a stable measurement, even if there are no dynamic changes in the environment [7]."}, {"heading": "B.

WIFI CHANNEL STATE INFORMATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. CSI of WiFi System", "text": "The wireless devices with the IEEE 802.11n / ac standards use multiple input and output signals (MIMO system). By using MIMO technology, it is possible to increase diversity increase, array amplification and multiplex amplification while simultaneously reducing interference on the eco-channel [10]. The modulation used in IEEE 802.11 is OFDM, whereby the bandwidth can be split between several orthogonal subcarriers. Due to the low bandwidth, the fading that each subcarrier faces is modeled as flat fading. Therefore, the small-scale fading property of the channel can be mitigated with OFDM. Let MT specify the number of transmitting antennas on the device and MR the number of receiving antennas on the AP. The MIMO system can be modeled at any time as the fading property of the Kanal yi = Hixi + ni + antenna, for AP = i}, for {S + ME, where the number of the receiving antennas on the number of the HiS, {S} and the number of the number of the receiving antennas on the number."}, {"heading": "B. Limitations and Errors of WiFi Systems", "text": "The amplitude of CSI is generally a reliable measurement that can be used for the extraction and classification of features, although it can change with the transmission power and the adjustment of the transmission rate. As will be discussed later, the burst noise can be reduced by the use of filtering techniques [9]. However, unlike amplitude, the phase of the WiFi system is affected by several sources of error, such as the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and the sampling frequency offset (SFO). The CFO exists due to the difference in the central frequencies (lack of synchronization) between the transmitter and the receiver. The CFO for a period of 50 \u00b5s of 5 GHz WiFi band can be as large as 80 KHz, resulting in a phase change of 8 KHz. Therefore, the phase changes due to the movement of the body, which is generally smaller than 0.5 KHz, are not observable."}, {"heading": "C. Effect of Human Motion on Wireless Channel", "text": "The CSI amplitude for a subcarrier and all antennas connected to a person walking and sitting between a WiFi transmitter and a receiver is shown in Fig. 2- (a). The person stands still for the first 400 packets, but then begins to walk or sit down. As observed, the CSI amplitudes are relatively stable for all antennas, but when activity sets in, the CSIs start to change drastically. Walking time is longer than sitting in this experiment because the person stops seating.The received phase is highly distorted due to the CFO and SFO, as mentioned above. This can be observed in Fig. 2- (b). However, using the phase anitization technique can eliminate the effects of phase errors. The calibrated phase can be observed in Fig."}, {"heading": "III. WI-FI CSI-BASED BEHAVIUOR RECOGNITION", "text": "In this section, we provide a summary of the techniques used by commercial WiFi network cards. Figure 3 shows the general diagram of activity detection systems using WiFi CSI."}, {"heading": "A. Histogram-based Techniques", "text": "One of these techniques is E-Eyes [13], in which the CSI histograms are used as fingerprints in a database. In the test phase, by comparing the histogram of the obtained CSI with the database, the closest one is found and thus the activity is detected. Pre-processing steps are low-pass filtering and modulation and encoding scheme (MCS) index filtering. The former is necessary to remove the radio frequency noise, which may not be due to human movement, and the latter is necessary to reduce the fluctuations of the unstable radio channels. Although the performance of this technique is good and its computing costs are low, the histogram technique is sensitive to environmental changes and therefore may not be suitable for different environments."}, {"heading": "B. CARM", "text": "This year it is as far as never before in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany."}, {"heading": "C. Using Deep Learning for Behaviour Recognition", "text": "The problem of activity detection is in some ways similar to the process of speech recognition, where HMM has traditionally been used for classification, but a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) has been seen as the counterpart to HMM. Training RNN is difficult because it suffers from a disappearing or exploding gradient problem, but it has been shown in [15] that using short-term memory (LSTM) as an extension of RNN can achieve the best accuracy to date in speech detection. Therefore, we propose to use LSTM for activity detection instead of other conventional machine learning techniques such as HMM, although trait is not performed in a similar way to CARM. \"Using LSTM has two advantages: First, LSTM can automatically extract the traits, in other words, there is no need to prepare the data before processing. Second, LSTM can detect temporal state information of activity storage, i.e., it can help to store low-level activities such as STM has potential."}, {"heading": "IV. EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT METHODS", "text": "In this section we will use different methods as well as our proposed method and show the performance of each one."}, {"heading": "A. Measurement Setup", "text": "We conduct the experiments in an office where Tx and Rx are 3 meters apart in the LOS state. The Rx is equipped with a commercially available Intel 5300 network card, with a sampling rate of 1KHz. A person begins to move in the LOS state and perform an activity within a period of 20 seconds, while the person remains stationary at the beginning and end of the period. We also record videos of activities so that we can label the data. Our data set includes 6 people, 6 activities called \"lying down, falling, walking, running, sitting, standing up,\" and 20 attempts for each."}, {"heading": "B. Evaluating Machine Learning Techniques", "text": "We use only the first 25 frequency components from 128 frequency bands, since most of the energy of the activities is in lower frequencies, and in this way the feature vector does not become economical. First, we use the random forest of 100 trees to classify the activities. Second, we implement other techniques such as the base vector, which contains enough information about an activity, but the modified STFT containers are stacked in a vector for every 2 seconds of the activity, making each feature vector of the length 1000."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSIONS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Effect of Environment Change on the Performance", "text": "The CSI characteristics are not the same for different environments and people. There are different techniques to reduce the impact of environments [9]. After using PCA, for example, the first component mainly includes the CSI information due to stationary objects [9]. By discarding the first main component, the information is mainly collected due to mobile audiences. Therefore, this technique can achieve relatively similar characteristics for different environments. Other techniques such as STFT and DWT represent the rate of multipath change related to the speed of movement of human body parts. Although the same activities in different environments lead to very different CSI characteristics, similar characteristics can be achieved for different environments and people with STFT or DWT [9] due to the similarity in signal reflection modification."}, {"heading": "B. Effect of Wi-Fi transmission rate on the performance", "text": "For the CSI to show noticeable changes due to motion, the transmission rate should be high enough (almost 1KHz) to capture fast-paced activities. At a sampling rate of about 50Hz, we have observed a sharp deterioration in the performance of the classification methods. Increasing the sampling rate increases the number of sampling rates and thus the computing costs for noise reduction and feature extraction. Increasing the frame rate may not help after a while, as human indoor motion speed is limited, so choosing a suitable sampling rate (about 1KHz) can achieve a good compromise between computing costs and accuracy."}, {"heading": "C. Using CSI Phase Information", "text": "Due to errors such as CFO and SFO, the WiFi CSI phase has rarely been used to detect activity in iteration until now. However, by subtracting phase information from neighboring antennas, the CFO and the SFO are eliminated. Phase difference is related to the arrival angle (AOA), although there is greater ambiguity in the number of full cycles of the received signal. Changing the target position can alter the AOA and hence the phase difference. If the motion is fast and drastic, the signal is scattered more arbitrarily by the human body, and therefore AOA and phase difference change faster. Therefore, using phase difference together with amplitude for the extraction of characteristics and then applying classification algorithms may be helpful, but further studies will be left to future work due to space constraints."}, {"heading": "D. Multi-user Activity Recognition", "text": "While the performance of many activity detection algorithms has been tested for a single user, the more interesting and challenging problem is when there are multiple people in the area. [2] a solution has been proposed to use the idea of MIMO receivers to separate the signals due to two different mobile objects. Using multiple receivers could also help distinguish the activities of multiple users. Some multi-speaker detection techniques could be applicable to the activity detection problem, but this remains an interesting open problem."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "This paper presents an overview of recent advances in human activity detection systems using the WiFi channel. Literature in this area shows promising approaches for good indoor accuracy. Numerical testing has shown that better accuracy can be achieved by using deep learning techniques such as RNN LSTM instead of methods such as HMM. There are still some challenges that need to be addressed in future work, such as how CSI phase information can be used in addition to amplitude, how to make the system robust in various dynamic environments, and how to identify the behavior of multiple users."}], "references": [{"title": "Wifall: Device-free fall detection by wireless networks", "author": ["C.
