Therefore, research into Vietnamese language processing is an essential task. This work focuses on three main tasks for processing Vietnamese language, including POS tagging, chunking and NER. In this work, we present a state-of-the-art system, namely NNVLP for processing Vietnamese language.

Specifically, most POS tagging toolkits attempted to use traditional models such as CRF (Mai-Vu Tran, 2013) and MEMM (Le-Hong et al., 2010). (Mai-Vu Tran, 2013) also used CRF for chunking tasks. Recently, at the VLSP 2016 workshop on NER tasks, several participating systems used MEMM (Le-Hong, 2016), (Nguyen et al., 2016) and CRF (Le et al., 2016) to solve this problem."}, {"heading": "3 NNVLP API and Web Demo", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 System Architecture", "text": "We implement the deep neural network model described in (Pham and Le-Hong, 2017).

Specifically, this model takes as input a sequence of concatenation of word embeddings trained by word2vec2 tool and word characteristics at character level. This sequence is then passed on to a Bi-LSTM, and then a CRF layer takes the sequence of the BiLSTM as input to predict the best named word embedding sequence.

In particular, we conduct experiments on the Viet Treebank corpus for POS tagging and chunking tasks, and on the VLSP corpus 2016 for NER tasks. All these corpus are converted to the CoNLL format. The corpus of the POS tagging task consists of two columns, namely Word and POS tag. For chunking tasks, there are three columns, namely Word, POS tag and chunking records in the corpus. The core of the NER task consists of four columns. The order of these columns is word, POS tag, chunk and designated entity. While the NER corpus has been separated into training and examination parts, the POS tagging and chunking records are not split up beforehand. Therefore, we use 80% of these data sets as training sets and the rest of our training set as our NP method, as we use the Early Date."}, {"heading": "4.2 Evaluation Methods", "text": "For chunking and NER tasks, performance is measured with the F1 value, where F1 = 2 \u0445 P \u043a RP + R.
