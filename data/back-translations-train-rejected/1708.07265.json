RELATED WORK", "text": "In the face of a text of unknown or disputed authorship and a number of author candidates, the goal of assignment is to identify the correct unknown author. [1] One of the most important findings in authorship studies was reported by Mosteller and Wallace. [17] They examined the authorship of several policy documents and discovered that the frequency of common words - such as some pronouns, prepositions and articles - is useful to characterize the authorship of texts. Traditionally, works in authorship use simple but useful characteristics to characterize writing styles, such as statistics extracted from words and characters (e.g. frequency of n-degrees of words or characters and frequency of interpretation marks) [1, 3, 4]. Syntactic and semantic characteristics can also be used for the task, such as the frequency of the components of a sentence and information about words, synonyms [1]."}, {"heading": "III. MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "The first step in creating mesoscopic networks is to pre-process the text. In this study, we remove stopwords (such as arti-cles and prepositions) and the remaining words are lemmatized, and the pre-edited text is then divided into a series of paragraphs (see Figure 2 (a)). Taking into account the paragraph order, all possible sentences of consecutive paragraphs are grouped, as shown in Figure 2 (b). Each sentence W-i = {pi, pi + 1.) is the set of words belonging to the same paragraph (see Figure 2 (a)). Taking into account the paragraph order, all possible sentences of paragraphs are summarized, as shown in Figure 2 (b). Each sentence W-i = {pi + 1.) is the set of f-nodes."}, {"heading": "Dataset", "text": "We used a data set of 50 English texts by 10 authors. These books are available in the Gutenberg repository [39] and the list of 50 texts is shown in Table I."}, {"heading": "Network analysis", "text": "Once the networks are created, topological measurements can be extracted. At this point, we measure accessibility (for h = {2, 3}) [22], degree [23], backbone and fused symmetry (for h = {2, 3, 4}) [24], assortment diversity [25], average degree of neighbors [26], and cluster coefficient [23]. Since most of the selected measurements apply to a single node, some statistics - such as average, standard deviation, and skew - were extracted from each distribution and used as features for the classification algorithms."}, {"heading": "Image analysis", "text": "According to Marinho et al. [16], the visualization of mesoscopic networks can provide information about the writing style of the authors (4). In the present study, we used image processing analysis to extract properties from these visualizations, which are used to characterize authors. First, the complex networks are visualized using a force-directed algorithm based on the attraction between connected nodes and the repulsion force between all pairs of nodes [27]. For this purpose, we used the software of Silva et al. [28] with fixed parameters. 2D visualizations were used to remove the need for defining the projection angle and the repulsion force of images. In addition, the images were converted into monochromatic versions (referred to as binary images). A pre-processing step was applied in which the images are expanded and eroded [29] to remove small holes. We considered the object size (4) and the intrinsic analysis (4) of the component."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "In this section, we will provide a qualitative analysis of the visual properties of the mesoscopic networks studied in this paper, supplemented by a discussion of the accuracy of the results of author assignment from experiments that all authors and experiments take into account taking into account only author pairs. Finally, we offer a principal component analysis to visualize the clustering of the data."}, {"heading": "Image analysis", "text": "To illustrate the peculiarities of the visual world present in the constructed networks in this paper, we have used a visualization method to create three networks of four different authors each: Edgar Allan Poe, Saki, Mark Twain, and Henry James. These networks are depicted in Figure 7. To better visualize the narrative flow, a color has been added to the images. Several of the loops that appear in the images are a consequence of network analysis. These loops could be removed manually, but we did not choose to interfere at any step of the process. The images obtained indicate a type of visual network whose edges are narrow, while the nodes correspond to the interactions that appear along these strings. Note that the string extremities also define nodes. Pieces of the same string initiate and end in a node are henceforth called visual networks. Nodes with multiple connections are called visual hubs."}, {"heading": "Authorship Attribution", "text": "In order to evaluate the ability of the proposed method to classify books according to their respective authors, we calculated all the image characteristics described in Section III, IF henceforth. These characteristics were selected and sorted according to SVM's (Support Vector Machine) attribute selection [36]. In addition, we used Expectation Maximization (EM) [37] and KMeans [38], which are unattended classification algorithms. The number of classes was set to 10 to reflect the number of authors. In order to find the best number of characteristics, we tested the n first characteristics in the ranking by varying n from 1 to F, where F is the total number of characteristics (see Table II). The best classification accuracy, 54%, was obtained with n = 14. This result supports the hypothesis that there are visual differences between the visualizations of the mesoscopic networks captured by the image properties. An alternative method to classify these texts is the network characteristics obtained from the use of the measurements."}, {"heading": "Pairwise Authorship Attribution", "text": "In Figure 8, we have the results for pairs of classifications, where only two authors are considered for each experiment. We use the classifiers with the best accuracy from the previous subsection. We can see that the results, which take into account both image and network characteristics, are expected to be better than those which only take into account one type of feature. Note that the results reflect our analysis in Section IV: while the result for the comparison between Poe and Saki and James and Twain was 70% accurate, all other results have an accuracy of 100%. This is a clear indication that the characteristics selected reflect our intuitions and that it is even possible to distinguish between similar networks, although improvements are desirable."}, {"heading": "PCA", "text": "Finally, PCA was applied to the image and the network and achieved a reasonable separation, especially from the network functions as shown in Figure 9. Network and image functions were combined to achieve a better separation as shown in Figure 10. From this figure, it is clear that our features are able to capture some stylistic decisions made by the authors. Thus, Poe and Saki have similar structures and are quite close to each other, but the features are clear enough to produce very little actual overlap."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Our approach involves applying a comprehensive set of image analysis techniques, ranging from simpler approaches such as area and circumference to more complex methods such as Fourier spectra and gaps. Specifically, our results suggest that the quantitative visual analysis of these networks has yielded results as good as those obtained using only topological characteristics. In addition, combining the two characteristic types improves mapping results. Possible extensions of the proposed work include consideration of other text types and literary periods, as well as other types of data, such as time series."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "H.F.A. and T.S.L. thank CAPES for the financial support.

analysis has received increasing attention as a consequence of its wide range of applications. In this work, we extend a previous work founded on the study of topological features of mesoscopic networks. Here, the geometrical properties of visualized networks are quantified in terms of several image analysis techniques and used as subsidies for authorship attribution. It was found that the visual features account for performance similar to that achieved by using topological measurements. In addition, the combination of these two types of features improved the performance.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
