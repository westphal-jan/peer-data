Although we focus our work on discrete time survival regression, our proposed approaches can also be applied to other problems with similar loss functions. In addition, our proposed approaches can easily be extended to discrete time regression models in which the explanatory variables change over time.

However, for sensitive survival data such as medical data, there are serious concerns about the privacy of individuals in the data set when medical data is used to \u0080t the regression models. \u008ce closest work addressing such privacy concerns is the work on Cox regression which linearly projects the original data to a lower dimensional space. However, the weakness of this approach is that there is no formal privacy guarantee for such projection. In this work, we aim to propose solutions for the regression problem in survival analysis with the protection of di\u0082erential privacy which is a golden standard of privacy protection in data privacy research. To this end, we extend the Output Perturbation and Objective Perturbation approaches which are originally proposed to protect di\u0082erential privacy for the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) problems. In addition, we also propose a novel sampling approach based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to practically guarantee di\u0082erential privacy with be\u008aer accuracy. We show that our proposed approaches achieve good accuracy as compared to the non-private results while guaranteeing di\u0082erential privacy for individuals in the private data set.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
