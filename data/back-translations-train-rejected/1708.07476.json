Moreover, stories are often told conversationally through dialog, and previous work suggests that information provided dialogically is more engaging than when provided in monolog. In this paper, we present algorithms for converting a deep representation of a story into a dialogic storytelling, that can vary aspects of the telling, including the personality of the storytellers. We conduct several experiments to test whether dialogic storytellings are more engaging, and whether automatically generated variants in linguistic form that correspond to personality differences can be recognized in an extended storytelling dialog.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Aug 2017 16:06:18 GMT  (533kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07476v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kevin k bowden", "grace i lin", "lena i reed", "marilyn a walker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.07476"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.07476.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "M2D: Monolog to Dialog Generation for Conversational Story Telling", "authors": ["Kevin K.

However, there are no statistically significant differences between m2d-basic and m2d-est or between m2d-basic and m2d-chatty. Comments from Turks suggest that the m2d-chatty speakers have more personality because they use many different pragmatic markers, such as questions and other dialogically oriented characteristics. The perception of naturalness through the same set of dialogical stories is shown in Figure 6. It shows that m2d-basic was rated higher than m2d-est, and their paired t-t-test shows that m2d-basic (including pronouns and aggregation) has a positive influence on the naturalness of a dialogue (0.0d = 0.0d = 0.0d = 0.0d = basic chatty = other 2d is noted) where m2d is frequently used."}, {"heading": "4.2 Personality Models", "text": "In this case, it is a reactionary, reactionary, reactionary and reactionary party."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion and Future Work", "text": "We suspect that dialogical storytelling can elicit more engagement from the listener, and that the ability to present a story as a dialogue will have many practical applications (e.g. with gestures [10].

learn social behaviors, and entertain. Moreover, stories are often told conversationally through dialog, and previous work suggests that information provided dialogically is more engaging than when provided in monolog. In this paper, we present algorithms for converting a deep representation of a story into a dialogic storytelling, that can vary aspects of the telling, including the personality of the storytellers. We conduct several experiments to test whether dialogic storytellings are more engaging, and whether automatically generated variants in linguistic form that correspond to personality differences can be recognized in an extended storytelling dialog.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
