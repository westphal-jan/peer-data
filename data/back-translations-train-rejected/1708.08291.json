One of the distinctive characteristics of entities is that they are typed, i.e., assigned to some hierarchically organized type system (type taxonomy). The primary objective of this paper is to gain a better understanding of how entity type information can be utilized in entity retrieval. We perform this investigation in an idealized \"oracle\" setting, assuming that we know the distribution of target types of the relevant entities for a given query. We perform a thorough analysis of three main aspects: (i) the choice of type taxonomy, (ii) the representation of hierarchical type information, and (iii) the combination of type-based and term-based similarity in the retrieval model. Using a standard entity search test collection based on DBpedia, we find that type information proves most useful when using large type taxonomies that provide very specific types. We provide further insights on the extensional coverage of entities and on the utility of target types.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 12:47:04 GMT  (624kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08291v1", "Proceedings of the 3rd ACM International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR '17), 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 3rd ACM International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR '17), 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["dar\\'io garigliotti", "krisztian balog"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.08291"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.08291.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "On Type-Aware Entity Retrieval", "authors": ["Dar\u0131\u0301o Gariglio\u008ai", "Krisztian Balog"], "emails": ["dario.gariglioi@uis.no", "krisztian.balog@uis.no", "permissions@acm.org."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "CCS CONCEPTS \u2022 Information systems \u2192 Retrieval Models and Ranking; KEYWORDS Entity retrieval, Entity types, semantic search ACM Reference format: Dar\u0131 \u0301 o Gariglio i and Krisztian Balog. 2017.

Our contributions are not in this section; the techniques we present have proven effective in previous research. We formulate our query task in a generative probabilistic framework. In an input query q, we evaluate the entities e by P (e | q) VP (q | e) P (e)). (1) Assuming uniform entity priority values, the internal ranking of the entities amounts to the estimation of P (q | e). We consider the query both in the term range and in the type space. Therefore, we write q = (qw, qt), where qw contains the query terms (words) and qt the target types. Two ways to consider the probability P (q | e) are presented in Section 3.1. All models share two components: curved similarity (qw, qw, qe, qe) and (qe)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Retrieval Models", "text": "We present two alternative approaches to combining term- and type-based similarity. 3.1.1 Filtering.

Following [27], weights are set to 0.2 and 0.8, respectively, which is a simple but solid approach.

Let's specify the target type distribution for query q (so that we designate the target type distribution for entity e. We assume that there is a mechanism that estimates this distribution; in our experiments, we rely on an \"oracle\" that provides us with exactly this information (see Section 6). Let's also designate the target type distribution for entity e.

It should be noted that entity type assignments are provided for each of these taxonomies; DBpedia and Freebase provide a single (mostly c) instance type for one entity, Wikipedia assignments include multiple categories for a particular entity (without any limitation), while YAGO adheres to the path-up representation.

In fact, the results in Section 7 showed that the limitations of using type information are more obvious when entities do not lack type assignments. Table 2 shows for each of the type taxonomies the number of entities that did not have type assignments in the KB (i.e. \"non-typed\" entities). Interestingly, although DBpedia has the lowest number of non-typed entities (only 35K of 4.6M), there are no types for more than 25% of the relevant entities (3.3K of 12.9K). Even for Freebase, which has the best coverage of the relevant entities, there is no type assignment in the KB."}, {"heading": "8.2 Revisiting the Target Types Oracle", "text": "Another aspect of type-based information that we are concerned about is the quality of the target types. So far, we have included all types related to known relevant units proportional to their frequency in the target type distribution (\u03b8q); we will refer to them as standard oracles. In this context, we consider another variant, the so-called Ltered Oracle, in which a frequency threshold is applied. Specifically, we include type t as target type i, to which at least three relevant units are not assigned. As a result of this lurch, many queries have an empty type collection; in this experiment, we discard these from the basic truth, so that we have a total of 182 queries. A comparison of the two oracles is shown in Figure 5. For the more general type representations, the lost oracle turns out to be somewhat less effective for most of the congregations. Nevertheless, comparisons between the two oracles are hardly noticeable."}, {"heading": "8.3 What is in a Target Type?", "text": "What proportion of the relevant entities can capture target types? To shed some light, we measure the coverage of relevant entities based on (i) the best-placed type and (ii) the set of the three best-placed types. 3 Table 3 reports on the results. We nd that Wikipedia has by far the highest precision and F1 score of all type taxonomies; YAGO comes second. Note that these are the two taxonomies that performed best when using the most specific types, in Figure 3. In summary, we found that specific types of large, fine-grained taxonomies perform best. However, it does not seem to be the hierarchical nature of the taxonomy that produces Bene, but rather the fact that these fine-grained types provide semantic sets or classes that can capture (some subsets) the relevant entities with high precision."}, {"heading": "9 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "An essential contribution of this work is the systematic comparison of four known type taxonomies (DBpedia, Freebase, 3For this experiment, we take the type assignments \"as recorded\" in Wikipedia without enforcing the taxonomic constraints. Wikipedia and YAGO) across three interesting dimensions: the representation of hierarchical entity information, the way in which term and type information can be combined, and the effects of selecting a particular type taxonomy. We have found that using the most specialized c types in a fine-grained taxonomy, such as Wikipedia, is the best way to access e-ectiveness.We identify two directions for future work. First, we plan to report on an even deeper analysis at the query level, which was not possible here due to space constraints. Second, our studies have so far taken place in an idealized environment where each goal can perform a similar \"14-type analysis.\""}], "references": [{"title": "\u008bery modeling for entity search based on terms, categories, and examples", "author": ["Krisztian Balog", "Marc Bron", "Maarten De Rijke"], "venue": "ACM Trans.

Using a standard entity search test collection based on DBpedia, we \u0080nd that type information proves most useful when using large type taxonomies that provide very speci\u0080c types.
