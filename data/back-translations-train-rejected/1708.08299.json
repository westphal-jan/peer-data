INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, modern communication networks generate an enormous amount of data at the level of the network infrastructure and at the level of the user / customer. The data on the network contains a wealth of useful information such as location information and call patterns. The vision of network operators is to enable new businesses by providing this data (or the information contained therein) to external service providers and customers, or to use the network data for internal services such as network optimization and management. To make the vision a reality, it requires the development and implementation of new machine learning methods in communication networks."}, {"heading": "2. MACHINE LEARNING IN COMMUNICATIONS", "text": "This section examines the use of machine learning algorithms in various areas of communication (see Fig. 1)."}, {"heading": "2.1. Communication Networks", "text": "Ma-ar Xiv: 170 8.08 299v 1 [cs.N I] 2 8A ug2 017chine learning methods have been used in the past to address various types of routing problems, including shortest-path routing, adaptive routing, and multicasting routing. [7] The authors proposed an algorithm for packet routing in dynamically changing networks based on reinforcement learning. [34] This algorithm learns a routing policy that balances the length of the route with the possibility of congestion along the popular routes. Extensions of this idea were proposed in [27]. Other researchers approached the routing problem with genetic algorithms. [34] Here, alternative routes are created by crossover and mutation of existing routes. Genetic algorithms were also used to tackle the multicasting routing problem that occurs when data is sent over a communication network to multiple recipients. [54] Mobile networks are also added to dynamic data construction networks through structural delays."}, {"heading": "2.2. Wireless Communications", "text": "In order to achieve high efficiency in the desired QoS, it is essential that the various parameters of the MIMO-OFDM systems are continuously adapted, in particular the linking parameters, in order to detect the differences in the communication environment. Various studies (e.g., [52]) deal with this parameter selection problem by means of machine learning. Due to the dynamics of the wireless communication environment, there is also a strong need for the adaptation of hardware parameters, e.g. in order to select a suitable set of transmitter and receiver antennas."}, {"heading": "2.3. Security, Privacy & Communications", "text": "Machine learning methods play a central role in solving private and security-related problems in communication, such as monitoring various network activities and detecting anomalies, i.e. events that differ from normal network behavior. In the past, various machine learning methods have been used to detect network anomalies (see [45]); other security applications include automatic spam filtering [21] and phishing attacks [4]. Privacy protection is an important security aspect in communications, especially when it comes to sensitive data. Increasing attention is being paid to the design of machine learning algorithms that respect privacy. [1] The authors of this paper have shown that it is possible to build a decision tree classification from corrupt data without significantly losing accuracy compared to the classifiers that were built with the original data, while at the same time it is not possible to accurately estimate the original values in the corrupt data sets, but still obtain algorithmic results from the classification."}, {"heading": "2.4. Smart Services, Smart Infrastructure & IoT", "text": "With recent advances in communications technology, the new field of \"smart\" applications has attracted increasing attention (e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart grids, Internet of Things).Machine learning algorithms are often the core component of such applications. Thus, the authors of [14] used a neural network-based prediction algorithm to predict and control the power generation of a photovoltaic system. Other researchers applied similar techniques such as traffic light control [48] in smart cities or context-aware computing in the IoT [37]. Machine learning can also help detect malicious events before they occur, e.g. in smart grid networks [18].Tasks such as predicting resource use, estimating response times, monitoring data traffic and optimal planning were also addressed with learning algorithms [49]."}, {"heading": "2.5. Image & Video Communications", "text": "Machine learning methods have been used for various tasks in multimedia communication and image processing (more than 200 applications of neural networks for images are summarized in [16]).Signal compression is an important area of application of these methods, as they are part of an almostevery multimedia communication system.An overview of image compression methods with neural networks can be found in [24].Tracking is another well-studied topic in machine learning that is also relevant in multimedia communication.In [12] a new generation of object tracking methods based on deep neural networks has been described, as well as tracking algorithms that use compressed video representation have recently gained attention [41].In multimedia applications such as video streaming, the quality of the video displayed is crucial. Various machine learning methods have been proposed to assess the subjective quality of images perceived by humans [5, 6]."}, {"heading": "3. EXEMPLAR APPLICATIONS IN WIRELESS NETWORKING", "text": "The design and operation of wireless networks is a highly demanding task. As we move towards the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G), researchers and practitioners are challenged by a variety of conflicting demands and promises, such as ever-increasing data rates. As a result, the main cause of the problems and constraints associated with 5G is the wireless channel. Furthermore, the wireless channel can be severely distorted, resulting in frequency, time, space and other system parameters. Therefore, the channel distortions are random and notoriously difficult to estimate and predict. Furthermore, the wireless channel is a shared communication medium that combines the available communication resources."}, {"heading": "3.1. Reconstruction of Radio Maps", "text": "The question is to what extent it is a matter of reducing the power density of a transmission signal that spreads from a Base Unit to a Geographical Position. Note: For each Geographical Position, its displacement loss is defined in relation to the strongest Base Unit, which is the largest Base Unit with the smallest displacement loss."}, {"heading": "3.2. Deep Neural Networks for Sparse Recovery", "text": "Recently, compressed sensors and deep learning processes have proven to be both theoretical and practical tools for unlocking the full potential and achieving basic theoretical limits - be it for decontaminating pilots in channel estimation, identifying users, detecting activities, or reducing PAPR. While research in many cases knows of optimal solutions - such as optimization problems for channel estimates with a minimum number of pilots - implementing this solution in embedded devices is considered unfeasible due to unpredictable scheduling times and the incalculable loss of early stops. In this regard, a makeshift solution aimed at large-scale measurement campaigns and the proliferation of black box data-driven learning techniques is quickly stripped of its enchantment for communication systems, as the need to pre-process and pre-interpret F-light becomes extremely disappointing under different environmental conditions, resulting in high environmental weaknesses."}, {"heading": "4. FUTURE RESEARCH TOPICS", "text": "This section discusses four future research topics in the field of machine learning and communication."}, {"heading": "4.1. Low Complexity Models", "text": "State-of-the-art machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, are known to work excellently in practice. However, because the training and execution of these models requires extensive computing resources, they may not be applicable in communication systems with limited memory, computing power, and energy resources, such as smartphones, embedded systems, or IoT devices. Recent work has addressed this problem and suggested techniques to reduce the complexity of deep neural networks. Thus, the authors of [22] showed that the size of VGG-16, a popular deep neural network for image classification, can be reduced by over 95% without loss of accuracy. In communication applications, such compression techniques can be used to efficiently store and transmit models. Other authors (e.g. [15]) focused on the problem of weight binarization in deep neural networks. This type of discretization can be useful, for example, in adapting model architectures to these process architectures, as it is not possible to combine the minimum number of complexes in these high-level architectures."}, {"heading": "4.2. Standardized Formats for Machine Learning", "text": "Standardisation of algorithms and data formats is essential in communication, as it increases the reliability, interoperability and modularity of a system and its components. As learning algorithms are increasingly used in communication applications, the need for standardised formats for machine learning is also increasing, for example, standardised formats could be used to define how to train, adapt, compress and exchange machine learning models in communication applications. In addition, there could be standardised data and standards formats that determine how multiple machine learning models interact with each other."}, {"heading": "4.3. Security & Privacy Mechanisms", "text": "Although more recent work [3, 33] suggests techniques to explain the predictions of a machine learning model, further research on this topic is of high importance, as the lack of transparency in communication applications can be a major disadvantage. Furthermore, it is known that deep neural networks can be easily deceived or behave unexpectedly when confronted with data that have properties other than the data used to form the model [43]. Therefore, establishing mechanisms that increase the reliability of the model is a prerequisite for large-scale deployment in communication applications. Such mechanisms can be implemented at various levels, e.g. be an integral part of the model into which communication protocols are integrated or be part of a separate inspection process. In addition to interpretability and security aspects, future research must also examine how machine learning can be effectively encrypted to ensure that data is protected during learning and during learning."}, {"heading": "4.4. Radio Resource and Network Management", "text": "The end-to-end performance of mobile networks is strongly influenced by the choice of radio resource parameters (e.g. beamforming and intermediate access controls) and network management (e.g. transfer parameters, neighborhood lists, loads and power budgets), and some of these parameters need to be continuously adapted to time-changing radio propagation conditions and changing network topologies in a relatively short time. [42] Current approaches are not sufficient to cope with the growth of autonomous network elements in 5G small cell deployments based on mobile cloud RAN architectures. Therefore, 5G networks require new model and data-driven methods for radio resource management and network management, complemented by machine learning, to extract knowledge from the system and gradually learn from inherent uncertainties and the lack of complete channel and network condition information. [38] Implementing these ideas in the context of 5G requires new protocols and the development of existing protocols."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "Learning algorithms not only excel in traditional network management tasks such as routing, channel estimation, or PAPR reduction, but are also a core component of many new application areas of communications technology, such as smart cities or the Internet of Things. The availability of large amounts of data and recent improvements in deep learning methodology will further promote the convergence of these two areas and offer new ways to optimize the entire communication pipeline end-to-end [36]. However, before resource-intensive models such as deep neural networks can be applied on a large scale in communication applications, several practical challenges (e.g. complexity, security, privacy) need to be solved. Further research on theoretical issues at the interface of communication and machine learning, e.g. gradual learning, learning in non-stationary environments, or learning with ancillary information is needed."}, {"heading": "6.
