Most major manufacturers including Tesla, GM, Ford, BMW, and Waymo/Google are working on building and testing different types of autonomous vehicles.

Several such accidents involving autonomous cars in the real world have already happened, including one that ended in death. Most existing testing procedures for DNN-powered vehicles rely heavily on manually collecting test data under various driving conditions, which become prohibitive as the number of test conditions increases. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate DeepTest, a systematic test tool for automatically detecting erroneous behavior of DNN-powered vehicles that can potentially lead to fatal crashes. First, our tool is designed to automatically generate test cases that use real-world changes in driving conditions such as rain, fog, lighting, etc. DeepTest systematically examines various parts of DNN logic by generating test inputs that maximize the number of neurons activated."}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "The fact is that we will be able to go in search of a solution that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us, that will enable us to put ourselves in the position we are in."}, {"heading": "2 BACKGROUND", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Deep Learning for Autonomous Driving", "text": "The key component of an autonomous vehicle is the perception module, which is controlled by the underlying Deep Neural Network (DNN). Each DNN takes input from various sensors such as camera, light detection and turnout sensor (LiDAR) and IR (infrared) sensor, which measures the environment and outputs the steering angle, braking, etc., which are necessary to safely maneuver the car under current conditions, as shown in Figure 2. In this essay, we focus on camera input and steering angle output. A typical DNN feed is composed of several stacked processing layers to extract different representations of the input [29]. Each layer of the DNN increasingly abstracts input, e.g. from raw pixels to semantic concepts. For example, the first few layers of an autonomous car are connected to DNN units."}, {"heading": "2.2 Different DNN Architectures", "text": "Most DNNs used in autonomous vehicles can be divided into two types: (1) Feed-forward Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and (2) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The DNNs we have tested include two CNNs and one RNN. We provide a brief description of each architecture below, and refer interested readers to [38] for more detailed descriptions. The most significant difference between a CNN and a fully connected DNN is the presence of a conversion layer. The neurons in one conversion layer are connected to only some of the neurons in the next layer, and multiple connections between different neurons share the same weight."}, {"heading": "3 METHODOLOGY", "text": "In order to develop an automated testing methodology for DNN powered autonomous cars, we need to answer the following questions: (i) How do we systematically explore the input-output spaces of an autonomous car DNN? (ii) How can we synthesize realistic inputs to automate such exploration? (iii) How can we optimize the exploration process? (iv) How do we automatically create a test oracle that can detect faulty behavior without detailed manual specifications? We briefly describe how DeepTest answers each of these questions below."}, {"heading": "3.1 Systematic Testing with Neuron coverage", "text": "The input-output space (i.e. all possible combinations of inputs and outputs) of a complex system such as an autonomous vehicle is too large for exhaustive exploration. Therefore, we must systematically divide the space into different equivalence classes and try to capture all equivalence classes. In this paper, we use the neuron coverage [69] as a mechanism for dividing the input space based on the assumption that all inputs are part of the same equivalence class."}, {"heading": "3.2 Increasing Coverage with Synthetic Images", "text": "Therefore, DeepTest focuses on creating realistic synthetic images by applying image transformations to seed images, mimicking various real-world phenomena such as camera lens distortions, object movements, different weather conditions, etc. To this end, we examine nine different realistic image transformations (varying brightness, varying contrast, translation, scaling, horizontal shear, rotation, blur, fog effects, and rain effects), which can be divided into three groups: linear, affine, and convolutional image transformations. Our experimental results, as described in Section 5, show that all of these transformations significantly increase neuron coverage for all DNA tested. Below, we describe the details of the transformations."}, {"heading": "3.3 Combining Transformations to Increase Coverage", "text": "Since the image transformations individually increase the neuron coverage in all test DNNs, one obvious question is whether they can be combined to further increase the neuron coverage. However, our results show that different image transformations tend to activate different neurons, i.e. they can be stacked together to further increase the neuron coverage. However, the state space of all possible combinations of different transformations is too large to exhaustively explore them. We provide a neuron coverage-oriented greedy search technique to efficiently search for combinations of image transformations that lead to higher coverage. We use this algorithm in RQ3 to generate images by applying multiple transformations and show that it increases the cumulative coverage of the images of the test DNNs. Algorithm 1: Greedy search for a combination of image transformations to increase the neuron coverage."}, {"heading": "3.4 Creating a Test Oracle with Metamorphic Relations", "text": "It is difficult to create detailed specifications for such a system as it essentially involves restoring the logic of a human driver. To avoid this problem, we use metamorphic relationships [32] between the behavior of the car across different synthetic images. The most important finding is that although it is difficult to determine the correct behavior of a self-driving car for each transformed image, relationships between the behavior of the car across certain types of transformations can be defined. (For example, the steering angle of the autonomous car should not change significantly for the same image - weather conditions, blur or any affinity transformations with small parameter values. Thus, if a DNN model defines positive behavior over certain types of transformations, we can generate a correct steering angle between the image Io and a steering angle."}, {"heading": "4 IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "We evaluate our techniques on three different levels of autonomous driving, which occupy top positions in the Udacity Self Driving Challenge [16]: Rambo [15] (2nd place), Chauffeur [10] (3rd place), and Epoch [12] (6th place). We choose these three models as a prime example of the parameters provided by the authors and the resulting challenge by DeepTest."}, {"heading": "5 RESULTS", "text": "In fact, it is so that we are in a time, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in a phase, in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we are in which we in which we are in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we in which we are in which we are in which we in which we in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we in which we are in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we in which we in which we are in which we in which we in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we in which we in which we are in which we in which we in which we in which we are in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we are in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we in which we are in which we are in which we in which we are in which we are in which we in which we in which we in which we in which we are in which we in which we in which we are in which we in which we are in which we in which we in which we in which we in which we in which we in which we in which we in which we in which we in which we in which we"}, {"heading": "6 THREATS TO VALIDITY", "text": "DeepTest generates new synthetic test cases by applying different image transformations to a range of seed images. We select the transformations and parameters used by DeepTest to generate synthetic images so that realistic images can be generated. However, these transformations are not exhaustive and may not cover all realistic cases. While our transformations, such as rain and fog effects, are realistic, the images generated may not be reproducible in reality due to a large number of unpredictable factors, such as the position of the sun, the angle and the size of the raindrops. However, as image processing techniques become more complex, the images generated will come closer to reality. A complete DNN model for driving an autonomous vehicle must also handle braking and acceleration in addition to the steering angle. We limited ourselves to testing only the accuracy of the steering angle, as our braking and acceleration models do not yet support the technical effects directly."}, {"heading": "7 RELATED WORK", "text": "This year, we have reached a point where it can only take one year to reach an agreement."}, {"heading": "8 CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we proposed and evaluated DeepTest, a tool for automated testing of DNN-powered autonomous cars. DeepTest maximizes the neuron coverage of a DNN using synthetic test images generated by applying different realistic transformations to a set of seed images. We use domain specific metamorphic relationships to find flawed DNN behavior without detailed specification. DeepTest can easily be adapted to other DNN-based systems by adapting the transformations and metamorphic relationships. We believe that DeepTest is an important first step in building robust DNN-based systems."}, {"heading": "9 REFERENCES", "text": "[1].

camera, LiDAR, etc., can drive without any human intervention. Most major manufacturers including Tesla, GM, Ford, BMW, and Waymo/Google are working on building and testing different types of autonomous vehicles. The lawmakers of several US states including California, Texas, and New York have passed new legislation to fasttrack the process of testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles on their roads. However, despite their spectacular progress, DNNs, just like traditional software, often demonstrate incorrect or unexpected cornercase behaviors that can lead to potentially fatal collisions. Several such real-world accidents involving autonomous cars have already happened including one which resulted in a fatality. Most existing testing techniques for DNN-driven vehicles are heavily dependent on the manual collection of test data under different driving conditions which become prohibitively expensive as the number of test conditions increases. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate DeepTest, a systematic testing tool for automatically detecting erroneous behaviors of DNN-driven vehicles that can potentially lead to fatal crashes. First, our tool is designed to automatically generated test cases leveraging real-world changes in driving conditions like rain, fog, lighting conditions, etc. DeepTest systematically explore different parts of the DNN logic by generating test inputs that maximize the numbers of activated neurons. DeepTest found thousands of erroneous behaviors under different realistic driving conditions (e.g., blurring, rain, fog, etc.) many of which lead to potentially fatal crashes in three top performing DNNs in the Udacity self-driving car challenge.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
