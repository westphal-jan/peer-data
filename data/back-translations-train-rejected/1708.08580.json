Yet the natural language generation (NLG) component for many of these systems remains largely handcrafted. This limitation greatly restricts the range of applications; it also means that it is impossible to take advantage of recent work in expressive and statistical language generation that can dynamically and automatically produce a large number of variations of given content. We propose that a solution to this problem lies in new methods for developing language generation resources. We describe the ES-Translator, a computational language generator that has previously been applied only to fables, and quantitatively evaluate the domain independence of the EST by applying it to personal narratives from weblogs. We then take advantage of recent work on language generation to create a parameterized sentence planner for story generation that provides aggregation operations, variations in discourse and in point of view. Finally, we present a user evaluation of different personal narrative retellings.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 03:11:20 GMT  (667kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08580v1", "SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["stephanie m lukin", "lena i reed", "marilyn a walker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.08580"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.08580.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Generating Sentence Planning Variations for Story Telling", "authors": ["Stephanie M.

However, natural language generation (NLG) can produce a large number of variations of predetermined content (Rieser and Lemon, 2011; Paiva and Evans, 2004; Langkilde et al., 2008; Mairesse and Walker, 2011) Such variations are important for expressive purposes, and we also for personalization and personalization."}, {"heading": "2 Story Generation Framework", "text": "It is about the way in which people live in the countries of the world in which they live, and about the way in which they live, and about the way in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, live, in which they, in which, in which they, in which, in which they, live, in which, in which, they, in which, they, in which, in which, in which, they, live, in which, they, in which, they, live, live, in which, they, in which, in which, in which, in which, they, in which, they, in which, in which, in which, they, live, they, live, in which, in which, they, live, in which, they, live, in which, in which, in which, in"}, {"heading": "3 Personal Narrative Evaluation", "text": "n > Person = > Person = > Person. \"We discovered several errors resulting from the variation in the blogs that are not present in the fables and kept them. < n > Person = > Person = > Person.\" < n < n > Syndicate Levenshtein's distance and BLEU score were compared."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Design and Results", "text": "We perform two experiments on Mechanical Turk to test variations generated by the deaggregation and parameters of the point of view.

Yet the natural language generation (NLG) component for many of these systems remains largely handcrafted. This limitation greatly restricts the range of applications; it also means that it is impossible to take advantage of recent work in expressive and statistical language generation that can dynamically and automatically produce a large number of variations of given content. We propose that a solution to this problem lies in new methods for developing language generation resources. We describe the ES-TRANSLATOR, a computational language generator that has previously been applied only to fables, and quantitatively evaluate the domain independence of the EST by applying it to personal narratives from weblogs. We then take advantage of recent work on language generation to create a parameterized sentence planner for story generation that provides aggregation operations, variations in discourse and in point of view. Finally, we present a user evaluation of different personal narrative retellings.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
