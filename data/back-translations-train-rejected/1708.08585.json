A strength of our computational framework is that it is based on very general methods for re-using existing story content, either from fables or from personal narratives collected from blogs. We first explain how a simple annotation tool allows naive annotators to easily create a deep representation of fabula called a story intention graph, and show how we use this representation to generate story tellings automatically.

When telling a story, events from the story are selected, ordered, and expressed in the discourse. We use this distinction to create Fabula Tales, a computerized framework for a virtual storyteller to tell the same story in different ways, using a series of general narrative variations, such as direct vs. indirect speech, character voice (style), standpoint, and focus."}, {"heading": "2 Repurposing Stories with Story Intention Graphs", "text": "Our framework builds on Elson's representation of Fabula, a so-called Story Intention Graph, or SIG. [5] The SIG allows to capture many aspects of a story, including key units, events, and tripods arranged in a timeline, and an interpretation of the overarching goals, plans, and beliefs of the agents of history [5]. Fig. 4 shows the portion of the SIG for The Startled Squirrel Story in Fig. 1. Elson's DRAMABANK provides 36 Aesop fables coded as SIGs, such as The Fox and the Crow in Fig. 3, and Elson's annotation tool Scheherazade allows minimally trained annotators to develop a SIG for each narrative."}, {"heading": "3 Generating Narratological Variations", "text": "We build Fabula Tales on two tools from the previous work: PERSONAGE and the ES-Translator [15,21]. PERSONAGE is an expressive natural language generation machine that automatically bridges the syntactic formalism of Deep Syntaktic Structures (DSYNTS) as an input. DSYNTS allows to be flexible in the generation, but the creation of DSYNTS is craftsmanship and time consuming. ES-Translator (EST) bridges the narrative representations of the SIG with the model of syntax."}, {"heading": "3.1 Point of View", "text": "From the deep syntactical structure in the format of DSYNTS, we can change the narrative style from the perspective of the third person to the perspective of the first person of any character in the story (see example A4 in fig. 6). We define simple rules to perform this transformation within the DSYNTS itself, not at the sentence level. Table 1 shows the DSYNTS, which are presented as XML structures, for the sentence The crow flew itself out of the window. To transform the sentence into the first person, only simple changes to the deep structure are necessary. In rows 9 and 10 in table 1, we assign the person the attribute 1 to specify a change of point of view to the first person. The surface realizer in PERSONAGE takes care of the transformations with its own rules, knowing which lexem is present in line 9, simply change to me and transfer the reference resolutions in line 10 to myself."}, {"heading": "3.2 Dialogue Realization", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "We present two experiments that demonstrate how the flexibility of EST, combined with our narrative parameters, can manipulate the perception of the characters and the engagement and interest of the story.

Subjects are given a free text field and are asked to enter as many words as they want to use to describe the characters in the story. Table 3 shows the percentage of positive and negative descriptive words when categorized by LIWC [17]. Some words include \"smart\" and \"sneaky\" for the relaxed and neutral fox and \"shy\" and \"wise\" for the shy fox. The relaxed and neutral crow was considered \"naive\" and \"gullible,\" while the shy crow is \"stupid\" and \"stupid\" for the shy fox. \"Overall, the crow is perceived as 0.001 = helpless."}, {"heading": "4.2 Perceptions of Voice and POV", "text": "In a statement, the company said: 'We are pleased to announce that we have reached agreement with the management of the Company and are pleased to announce that we have entered into a definitive agreement with the management of the Company and its subsidiaries to acquire and operate the Company and its subsidiaries."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion and Future Work", "text": "We present examples that show that the skill we have developed is general and can be applied to informal personal narratives.
