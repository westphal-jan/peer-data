Based on the interactivity characteristic of IDS, it can be designed to work either on-line or offline.

CFS is a filtering algorithm that uses a correlation-based heuristic evaluation function to rank feature parts. A good set of features is strongly correlated with the class (target) and at the same time not correlated with each other. Redundant features are ignored because they have a low correlation with the class and transform into a high correlation with one or more of the remaining characteristics. A feature is accepted based on the extent to which it predicts classes in areas of the instance space that were not predicted by other characteristics. Equation (8) shows the CFS feature enhancement function. V = MWXYMSM MZ2 WYY (5) Where V is heuristically \"merit\" of a feature group that contains features that contain features is the average feature class."}, {"heading": "5.3 Experimental Results", "text": "The classification of neural networks and support vectors consists of two phases: the classification phase and the training phase, as shown in Fig. 3. In the training phase, the algorithm learns the distribution of characteristics with corresponding classes. During the classification phase, the learned model is applied to a test set that the training phase has not seen before. In this thesis, the experiment was trained by training ANN and SVM with UNB-CIC Tor Network Traffic datasets to detect non-gate traffic. In the first set of the experiment, ANN was trained with all 28 characteristics of the data set with 20-hidden neurons and with 10 characteristics selected with CFS with 6-hidden nodes. ANN uses Levenberg-Marquardt Training Function (trainlm) for learning. In the second set of the experiment, ANN was trained with all 28 characteristics of the data set with 20-hidden neurons and with 10 characteristics were evaluated by CANS, using the data set with 4.S and FM were selected."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This work focuses mainly on the detection of non-Tor traffic in a representative dataset of real traffic in order to detect activities within Tor traffic that reduce user privacy. It proposes a CFS-ANN hybrid classifier for detecting non-Tor traffic in the UNB-CIC Tor Network Traffic dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed NonTor algorithm detects with an accuracy of 99.8%, a detection rate of 100% and a false positive rate of 1.2%. The proposed algorithm works better than SVM and C4.5 in [7], as shown in Table 4. The proposed hybrid classifier reduces the dimensionality of the data size by 65% by removing the less effective features, thereby reducing calculation costs and training time."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The authors thank the Canadian Institute of Cyber Security, University of Brunswick, for providing the dataset to carry out this work."}], "references": [{"title": "TorWard: Discovery, Blocking, and Traceback of Malicious Traffic Over Tor", "author": ["Z.
