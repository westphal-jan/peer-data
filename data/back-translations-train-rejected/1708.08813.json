It is an anomaly that is much more difficult than traditional detection, where we know the signal we wish to detect. Many methods for detecting anomalies have been proposed, and the method being investigated in this project is based on estimating the entropy of a signal directly from the data. Entropy itself is estimated by first estimating the probability density function using the k-next neighbor (k-NN) technique, which is applied to actual measured data. 1) The pre-dissertation phase includes a literature survey on the use of anomalies within wireless sensor networks, as well as the preparation of a Matlab simulation of suitable test signals."}, {"heading": "ABSTRACT", "text": "Anomalies are strange data points; they usually represent an unusual occurrence.

Various approaches have been taken in the past, as we will see, not only to identify outliers, but also to establish the statistical properties of the various methods.The usual goal is to show that the approach is asymptotically efficient and that the metric used is impartial or possibly biased. This project is based on a paper by [1]. The approach is based on the principle that the entropy of the data is increased when an anomalous data point is measured. The entropy of the data set is therefore impartial or possibly biased. However, this report presents preliminary efforts to confirm the results of [1].

Many methods rely in one way or another on the probability distribution function of the data [1] [14], usually in combination with another property. This project represents, as already mentioned, an anomaly detection method based on the change (increase) in entropy that occurs when anomalous data is collected as shown in [1]. It works based on the fact that outliers are further away than any other data point in the dataset. This distance calculation is krux. This method does not assume any specific form for the measured data and so the pdf of the data is calculated first.
