For example, whether it rains tomorrow is a piece of information that we have not observed, so we are uncertain about its truth value. However, we may also have uncertainty about purely deductive statements that are completely determined by the information we have, due to limited reasoning ability. That is, before we have proven or refuted a mathematical statement, we have a certain deductive uncertainty about whether there is a proof or a refutation. Under deductive uncertainty, there is a familiar process of evaluating a degree of faith in one way or another that a statement has a high or low plausibility. We can express rough confidence levels in notable open assumptions such as P 6 = NP [21] or the Goldbach conjecture, and we also deal with plausibility in everyday mathematical thinking. Sometimes, general patterns show up about problems and we raise them to new levels."}, {"heading": "1.2 The (modeling) problem", "text": "It is easy to give examples of general statements about integers in which the probability itself can be estimated. For example, the probability of the proposition stating that there is at least one digit 6 for each uncertainty is higher than for any other digit. However, one can be unsure whether it makes sense to ask what the probability of this general statement is, how to do it for a greater and greater probability. Boolos, of course, asks how such probabilities are calculated [4]: However, one can be unsure whether it makes sense to ask what the probability is for this general statement, since it has not been falsified under n = 1000000, or whether it exceeds the probability. With Boolos, we want to know how subjective deductive probabilities generally work? Do they even make sense to assign these probabilities?

Importantly, we cannot meaningfully talk about problems with only one input, since the best output is obviously the actual truth value. Thus, we must speak of uncertainty over a whole series of inputs at the same time. Probability spaces consist of a measurable space and a measure of probability. In Bayesianism, measurable space can be replaced by a \"propositional space\" closed under logical operations. In the deductive case, each non-trivial problem has an input set that is trivially closed under logical operations, as each input is logically equivalent to \"true\" or \"false.\" We come to the conclusion that the problem does not require a special syntactical structure and that we consider standard problems from theoretical computer science."}, {"heading": "2.1.3 Epistemic quality vs. computation costs", "text": "It is not only a question of time, but also of the way in which we decide whether we can take into account regularity for all the functions we claim for ourselves.

Another interpretation is that the cost of calculation can effectively decrease over time, increasing the budget set of feasible functions. This notation and terminology point to an analogy in which knowledge in the sense of calculation (such as that of [15, Sec. 9.2.3, 16, Sec. 7.2]) takes the place of information. In full generality, an agent may have an internal state that influences the calculated plausibility function.

Betting decisions must include the chance to buy, sell, or do nothing; only the choice between buy and nothing allows p + 0 to mean no bets at all. Bets must be finite, otherwise the analysis is trivial. It is possible that a betting event itself contains new knowledge to which we should update prior to betting. This would be the case if the party offering the bet is known to have access to a powerful oracle. For operational purposes, we consider situations where we do not update the bet itself; for example, if the bidding party is known to be stupid or not self-determined.

Some work has been done on formal models of logical non-omniscience, including a resource-limited AIXI [23] and resource-limited Solomonoff before [27]. Even the approximate inference in Bayesian networks is NP-hard, although there is research on methods such as faith propagation that is successful in particular cases. The general problem remains, at least in the following form. Solomonoff's recursion theory notion of extrapolation [24, 27] gives an ideal family of \"universal\" previous distributions that are suitable for general agents. However, there is no useful relationship of improvement on approximations, since there is only one ideal that is unpredictable, and no guidance on how best to approach it."}, {"heading": "3.3 Decision theory", "text": "It is not clear what relationship plausibility should have with a more general decision theory. Even with physical or deductive uncertainty, the expected benefit maximization needs to be modified in the case of limited agents, since tasks other than assigning plausibility can also be difficult in arithmetical terms. Consistency is a common assumption that allows simple decisions about bets and usefulness to determine arbitrarily complex decisions. In the face of arithmetic problems that can only be approximated by an actual agent, such as integration or optimization, this kind of consistency is not feasible. Therefore, repealing a theory of bets to a theory of general decisions also involves taking into account arithmetic solutions for the various problems involved in more general decisions. Our approach here could already include important parts and concepts for a more general theory. Models of deductive uncertainty based on formal logic are associated with applications of Yaney intelligence [38], artificial sky, [39] and [39] the present sky."}], "references": [{"title": "Computational complexity and information asymmetry in financial products", "author": ["S.
