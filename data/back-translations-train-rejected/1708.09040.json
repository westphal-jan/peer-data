The ALL feature set contains all the characteristics described in paragraph 4.1 (without BOW). We achieved high precision and F measurement using the discourse characteristics. We also experimented with our top feature from the InfoGain analysis But-Present, which surprisingly achieves a high F-level compared to the use of ALL and discourse characteristics. The last row of Table 6 shows the results of the use of ALL characteristics without but-present. This indicates that characteristics motivated by the narrative structure primarily produce improvements."}, {"heading": "4.4 Comparison to Previous Work", "text": "We directly compare our methods and characteristics with the most relevant previous work (Chaturvedi et al., 2016), applying their models to two sets of data and reporting on the results of the fulfilled class.

We also present the results of our LR model with our discourse characteristics Discourse-LR, which have been trained and tested on their corpora to compare their characteristics. The first three lines show the results of Chaturvedi et al. (2016) for comparison. As described in Section 2, they used BOW as their starting point, LSNM is their best model, and Unstruct-LR is their unstructured model, which exceeds all their characteristics with LR.In both corpora, Discourse-LR Unstruct-LR, showing that the discourse characteristics are stronger indicators of the status of desired fulfillment when used with LR classifier."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We show that contextual characteristics help with classification, and that both previous and subsequent contexts are useful. Finally, we show that using the narrative structure is helpful, both directly in terms of the benefit of features of the discourse relationship and indirectly through the superior performance of a skip-think LSTM model. In future work, we plan to investigate richer features and models for semantic and discourse-based characteristics, as well as the benefit of more narrative-conscious characteristics. For example, the sentiment flow characteristics roughly pursue the notion that the arc of a narrative could implicitly reveal the resolution of a goal through changes in emotional states. We hope to investigate whether there are other harsh measures of change across the entire narrative that can improve the results. DesireDB contains annotator-labeled spans as evidence for the announcer's conclusions. While we did not use this labeling, we plan to use this problem automatically in the course of the narrative to use it."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was supported by Nuance Foundation Grant SC-14-74, NSF Grant IIS-1302668-002 and IIS-1321102."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Many genres of natural language text are narratively structured, a testament to our predilection for organizing our experiences as narratives.
