In practice, the attacker changes the graph based on the underlying data that is bundled. For example, if the vertices of a graph are infected hosts and the domains they query, as in Pleiades, the representation of the graph can be altered by custom malware that changes its regular query behavior."}, {"heading": "3.1 Notation", "text": "An undirected graph G is defined by its groups of nodes V and edges E, where G = (V, E) and E = {(vi, vj): if there is an edge between vi and vj, vi, V, vj, and V. An undirected two-sided graph is a special case, where V can be divided into two disjunct groups (U and V), so that each edge connects at a vertex in U and one in V, represented as G = (U, V, E). While the attacks are generally true, bilateral graphs often appear in security contexts: hosts (U) query domains (V), clients connect to servers, malware system calls, and so on. Finally, a complete undirected two-sided graph is where each vertex in U has an edge to each vertex in V. G is an undirected graph that represents the underlying data."}, {"heading": "3.2 Threat Model", "text": "Before describing the indicators, we discuss that all attackers have at least one active source of infection, or that they can use any information going from G to G. We assume that an attacker poses a real threat to himself."}, {"heading": "3.3 Attacks", "text": "We present two novel attacks against graph clusters. The first, targeted noise injection, improves the random costs we have measured by mimicking the legitimate signal structure. The second, small community attack, utilizes the well-known phenomenon of small communities in graphs (30, 32). Our attacks violate both the homophilic and the structural equivalence assumptions used by graph clustering methods. That is, our attacks either change what hurts the nodes in their vicinity, or they alter observations of node neighborhoods to violate structural equivalence assumptions. Identification of a successful attack depends on the system described in detail in Section 4. Since we use Pleiades, we evaluate attacks by classifying the resulting adversarial clusters. However, this could happen purely at the level of unverified results."}, {"heading": "4 ATTACKS IN PRACTICE", "text": "We decided to attack the Pleiades because it was used commercially and is based on graph modeling. Our reimplementation has a similar performance as shown in Appendix 10.3. We will now describe parts of the reimplementation in detail."}, {"heading": "4.1 Pleiades", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "4.2 Attacks", "text": "Using the notation described in Section 3, G is meant to be a two-sided graph of defense. U represents both infected and uninfected hosts, and V represents NXDOMAINs queried by hosts on the underlying network.An advantage arises from vi-U and vj-V when the ith host queries the jten NXDOMAIN. In an attacker graph G-G, the hosts inU are infected hosts under the attacker's control. In the noise injection case, the attacker instructs his malware to ask NXDOMAINs beyond what is necessary for normal operation, as in Figure 1. In the small community case, the attacker coordinates the query behavior of his malware so that they query fewer NXDOMAINs together, as in Figure 2. We will consider the effectiveness of the attacks by decreasing the predicted class probabilities and the predicted label of the forest classification to be considered an average if the marginal class is predicted to be successful in a forest."}, {"heading": "4.3 Attack Costs", "text": "To calculate the anomaly cost of noise injection, we analyze percentile changes in the edges of hosts in U in the structure of G before and after the attack. We quantify this change by calculating the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs, example in Appendix 10.1) of the vertex degrees before and after a successful attack. Specifically, if an attacker can evade the plejades but increases the profile of his infected hosts from the 50th percentile (in the CDF before the attack) to the 99.9th percentile of the determined NXDOMAINs per host (in the CDF after the attack), a defender will be able to detect such behavior with a simple threshold (i.e., by monitoring hosts entering the 95th percentile). To quantify the opposing costs behind the small community attack, we measure the change in the attacker graph density D (G \u2032) in the sense of Section 5.3."}, {"heading": "5 RESULTS", "text": "First, we show how to select hyperparameters for each of the three diagram methods. Second, we present our results for both attacks against each graph-based cluster technique for the three levels of knowledge. Finally, we explain the costs incurred by the attacker and how these can be used to identify potential defenders. Summary of the results. Our attacks against the graph-based cluster component of the Pleiades significantly reduce the predicted class probability of the subsequent classification phase. Even with minimal knowledge, an opponent can launch an effective targeted noise injection attack that reduces the median predicted class probability to 0%. In the higher levels of knowledge, the maximum predicted class probability can only be 10%. Using a set of designated DGA malware families observed in spectral clustering, the attacks reduce the predictive accuracy from 99.6% to 0%. In addition to the effectiveness of the attacks, the attacks increase the profile of anomaly-like hosts to substantially lower the number of DOMA hosts we accept."}, {"heading": "5.1 Choosing Hyperparamters", "text": "First, we carefully select hyperparameters for the graph clustering methods in Pleiades to ensure that high-quality clusters are generated. Figure 11 shows the results used to determine the appropriate hyperparameters. 5.1.1 Spectral clustering. We use the scree values shown in Figure 4 to select the rank of SVD. We fix the rank of SVD to 35, where the scree plot plateaus are. Although different from the 15 used in the original Pleiades implementation [9], the underlying datasets are different, so it is not unreasonable to find different areas. 5.1.2 Community Discovery we use the best partition method from the NetworkX Community Discovery Library [61], which implements the Louvain algorithm [14]. The Louvain algorithm efficiently extracts good communities on the graph by comparing the modularity linkages within the commons to the community metrics outside the DMS."}, {"heading": "5.2 Targeted Noise Injection", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them have behaved in the manner in which they have behaved in the past years, namely, in the manner in which they have behaved in the manner in which they have behaved in the manner in which they have behaved in the manner in which they have come into the world, in the manner in which they have come into the world, in the manner in which they have come into the world, in the manner in which they have come into the world, in the manner in which they have come into the world, in the manner in which they have come into the world, in the manner in which they have come into the world, in the manner in which they have come into the world, and in the way in which they have come into the world, in the world and in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world and in the people, in the world and in the world, in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world and in the manner in which they have come into the world, in the way in the way in which they have come into the world, in the world, in the world and in the way in the way in the way in which they have come into the world, in the world, in the world, in the world and in the way in the way in the way in the way in the world, in the world and in the way in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world and in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world and in the world,"}, {"heading": "5.3 Small Community", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before to being able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "6 DEFENSE", "text": "In this section, we propose two defense techniques to help the Pleiades maintain their detection capacities against the two attacks: the first is to train the classifier with noise, eliminating the attack on the sound injection to some extent; the second is to use the attack on the small community as an enemy guideline to choose better hyperparameters for the embedding of graphs, which increases the cost of conducting a successful attack on the small community."}, {"heading": "6.1 Training Classifier with Noise", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be once before there is a scandal."}, {"heading": "7 DISCUSSION", "text": "We acknowledge that details around implementing the attacks are specific to the Pleiades, but the graph representation suggests that attacks on other graph-based systems can work. In this section, we briefly discuss issues that need to be taken into account in generalizing the attacks. Nodes and edges can be trivially inserted or removed in the graph that are generated by malware to resolve the domain names. In other security contexts, the set of injectable / removable nodes varies. On the other hand, adding certain nodes and edges to make certain attack actions successful can be difficult. For example, a phishing email that uses a malicious attachment requires at least the read system call to successfully infect a host that cannot be removed from the system call graph. In addition to the anomalous costs (Section 5.2.4) and mobility costs (Section 5.3.4), adding certain nodes and edges can therefore be difficult."}, {"heading": "8 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have shown that generic attacks on graphs can destroy a real system using multiple popular graph-based modeling techniques, which can often be carried out by limited adversaries at low cost; however, simple defenses can reduce their effectiveness or probability of success. To summarize how defenders can improve their systems: hyperparameter selection should be optimized to reduce the success rate of small attacks on communities, and retraining can be used to reduce the impact of attacks on space injection. Furthermore, state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques such as node2vec seem to be more resistant to attacks on small communities, suggesting that plejades and other systems would be more difficult to manipulate by applying node2vec at the community level or spectral methods (see Figure 9 vs. Figure 7)."}, {"heading": "9 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We would like to thank our anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback and Dr. Rosa Romero-G\u00f3mez for their help in visualizing this material.
