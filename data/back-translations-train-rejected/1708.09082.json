Overview of the Personal Story Corpus", "text": "The PersonaBank corpus contains 108 SIGs created from personal stories, which were selected from the Spinn3r corpus and commented on for the theme of the story (Burton et al., 2009). We use a Lucene index to sow themes and rate stories from the 1.5 million stories (Swanson and Gordon, 2012). We start with a list of seeds for a garden theme that we use [Tree, Trees, Farm, Garden, Yarn, Grass, Plants,...]. We get the retrieved list of stories and decide whether the story is relevant or not relevant to a particular topic. We assign to the story characteristics that allow us to filter stories that we consider interesting, coherent, overall positive or negative, and that can code as SIGs by taking the following into account: The storyteller is the storyteller, there is a clear chronological sequence of events, and the story is not decisive. We select stories from 55 that are positive, 53 that are negative in total."}, {"heading": "4.
