Our hypothesis is that online dialogues have important properties that can make them a useful resource for educating the public about such issues. For example, user-generated personality arguments can be more engaging and compelling than traditional media, due to the prevalence of emotional language, social affiliation, dialogical argumentation structure, and audience participation. In addition, certain types of people may be more or less convinced of certain argumentation styles, e.g. emotional arguments resonate with some personalities, while factual arguments resonate with others. For example, the two informal dialogical exchanges on the death penalty in Table 1 with the traditional professional summaries of the media in Table 2. We might expect the reasoning in Table 2 to be more convincing because it is carefully written to be balanced and exhaustive (Reed and Rowe, 2004)."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Recently, however, several papers have begun to examine two challenges in the area of argumentation mining: (1) understanding the structure of an argument and extracting argumentation components (Lippi and Torroni, 2015; Nguyen and Litman, 2015; Stab and Gurevych, 2014; Lippi and Torroni, 2015; Biran and Rambow, 2011); and (2) understanding what the persuasive power of argumentation content from the web predicts (Habernal and Gurevych, 2015; Stab and Gurevych, 2016; Wachsmuth et al, 2016; Habernal and Gurevych, 2016a; Tan et al., 2016) study Change of Faith in Reddit / r / r Mysubreddit (CMV), in which a poster (original poster) challenges other opinions on changing opinions."}, {"heading": "3 Experimental Method", "text": "Our experimental method consists of the following steps: \u2022 Choose user-generated dialogues with compelling reasoning characteristics from an online corpus of socio-political debates and examine the role of affects (paragraph 3.1). \u2022 Profile topics for personality traits and previous beliefs on socio-political topics (paragraph 3.2). \u2022 Expose subjects to user-generated, factual and emotional dialogical exchanges and compare the impact on faith change with balanced, curated arguments (paragraph 3.3). \u2022 Perform experiments to predict the degree of faith change depending on prior conviction, personality and type of reasoning. Participants were pre-qualified by a reading comprehension task that tested their re-spontaneously against a gold standard to ensure that they read the arguments carefully. As we make many comparisons and our experiments are conducted on a large scale, all of our results include corrections with bonuses."}, {"heading": "3.1 Dialog Selection: Identifying Socio-Emotional Arguments", "text": "We use online dialogues from 4forums.com, downloaded from The Internet Argument Corpus (IAC) (Walker et al., 2012c). The IAC includes quote-response pairs of targeted arguments between two people (Table 1) on topics such as: capital punishment, gay marriage, climate change, abortion, evolution, and gun control. Each argument is provided with comments to distinguish arguments that present strong appeals to emotional factors from directly objective arguments, i.e. answers with an average of 4 comments were considered factual, and those whose comments were rated as emotional on an average scale of -5 to 5. Table 1 illustrates both factual (R1) and emotional (R2) responses (RAC), with the correspondence with other topics in Table 0.007 points."}, {"heading": "3.2 Personality", "text": "Personality is usually measured using a standardized survey that calculates a scalar value for the five oceanic characteristics: openness to experience O, conscientiousness C, extraversion E, amenity A, and neuroticism N (Goldberg, 1990; Norman, 1963). We first conducted an experiment to profile the big five personality traits of 637 Turks using the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) (Gosling et al., 2003), which defines each person on a scale from 1 to 7 with 0.5 precision. To ensure the reliability of our results, we then verified that our prequalified Turks are representative of the entire population by comparing the mean and standard deviations of our sample of 637 Turks with the standards given in Gosling et. al (2003)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Prior Beliefs and Belief Change", "text": "Previous research suggests that people who are rooted in a topic are unlikely to change their minds (Anderson, 1971; Davies, 1998; Devine et al., 2000), so we wanted to establish the basic beliefs of our pre-qualified Turks before they were exposed to any arguments on a topic. We therefore gathered each Turk's starting point on a topic by asking them to answer a simple question without context, for example: Should the death penalty be allowed? Liked answers were recorded on a slider scale of -5 to 5 with 0.01 degrees of precision, with labels on the slider of \"Yes,\" \"No,\" or \"Neutral.\" Our goal is to compare the change in beliefs resulting from social media dialogues with the change in beliefs of professionally curated monologues. We chose the balanced monological summary of the arguments from the ProCon.org website (in Table 2 with an additional example in Table 5)."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Corpus Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Entrenchment and Belief Change", "text": "Our first question is whether our method changed participants \"beliefs. Table 6 shows faith changes depending on the type of argument: Monologues (MONO), Facts (FACT), and Emotions (EMOT). Faith changes occurred across all types of reasoning: and the change was statistically significant as measured by paired t-tests (t (5184) = 38.31, p < 0.0001). This confirms our hypothesis that social media can be degraded according to compelling material. In addition, all three types of reasoning independently led to significant changes in belief. 2One of the strongest theoretical predictions is that people with entrenched beliefs about an issue are less likely to change their minds if they provide new information on the topic. Table 6 shows the relationship between initial beliefs and the extent of faith change. We defined people with more entrenched original beliefs when their response to the initial positional question was within the range of 1.5-0.5, or 1.5-4.5."}, {"heading": "4.2 Argument Type and Belief Change", "text": "We wanted to test whether the engaging, socially interesting dialogical materials of EMOT and FACT could promote more faith changes than balanced curated monologue summaries. We tested the differences between argument types and found a main effect for the argument type (F (2,5179) = 31.59, p < 0.0001), with Tukey post-hoc tests showing that MONO led to more faith changes than both EMOT and FACT (both p < 0.0001), but overall no differences between EMOT and FACT in all subjects (see Table 6). Finally, there was no interaction between Initial Belief and Argument Type (F (2,5179) = 1.25, p > 0.05): So although neutrals show more faith changes overall, this susceptibility does not differ by argument type."}, {"heading": "5 Predicting Belief Change", "text": "Our results to date show that our arguments have changed people's beliefs depending on their previous beliefs and types of reasoning. However, we aim to automatically predict changes in beliefs, and we believe that knowing a person's personality, combined with their previous beliefs, allows us to select arguments on social media that are more compelling to a particular person. Therefore, we differ on whether providing traits about a person's personality improves performance in predicting changes in beliefs, compared to providing information about the degree of anchoring alone. We use different representations of personality and previous beliefs as traits, the raw value from the Believe Change Slider and TIPI Score, and normalization of the raw values according to distributions per topic, and finally categorical binning of the transformed values."}, {"heading": "5.1 Feature Development and Selection", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are in a position to move into a different world, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "5.2 Belief Change Experimental Results", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive themselves without being able to survive themselves.

We hypothesize that social media arguments on such issues may be more engaging and persuasive than traditional media summaries, and that particular types of people may be more or less convinced by particular styles of argument, e.g. emotional arguments may resonate with some personalities while factual arguments resonate with others. We report a set of experiments testing at large scale how audience variables interact with argument style to affect the persuasiveness of an argument, an under-researched topic within natural language processing. We show that belief change is affected by personality factors, with conscientious, open and agreeable people being more convinced by emotional arguments.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
