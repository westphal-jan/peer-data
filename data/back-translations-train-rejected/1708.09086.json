While bottom-up, survey driven censuses can provide a comprehensive view into the population landscape of a country, they are expensive to realize, are infrequently performed, and only provide population counts over broad areas. Population disaggregation techniques and population projection methods individually address these shortcomings, but also have shortcomings of their own. To jointly answer the questions of \"where do people live\" and \"how many people live there,\" we propose a deep learning model for creating high-resolution population estimations from satellite imagery. Specifically, we train convolutional neural networks to predict population in the USA at a $0.01^{\\circ} \\times 0.01^{\\circ}$ resolution grid from 1-year composite Landsat imagery. We validate these models in two ways: quantitatively, by comparing our model's grid cell estimates aggregated at a county-level to several US Census county-level population projections, and qualitatively, by directly interpreting the model's predictions in terms of the satellite image inputs. We find that aggregating our model's estimates gives comparable results to the Census county-level population projections and that the predictions made by our model can be directly interpreted, which give it advantages over traditional population disaggregation methods. In general, our model is an example of how machine learning techniques can be an effective tool for extracting information from inherently unstructured, remotely sensed data to provide effective solutions to social problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 02:05:16 GMT  (5138kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09086v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["caleb robinson", "fred hohman", "bistra dilkina"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.09086"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.09086.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Deep Learning Approach for Population Estimation from Satellite Imagery", "authors": ["Caleb Robinson", "Fred Hohman", "Bistra Dilkina"], "emails": ["dcrobins@gatech.edu", "fredhohman@gatech.edu", "bdilkina@cc.gatech.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Many countries introduce censors to gather rich information about the size of their populations, composition and demographics.

We test our models using the 2010 versions of the same datasets and evaluate population estimates in two ways: (1) aggregate the estimates of our model at the county level, and then compare them with projected county population numbers; and (2) show why our model makes predictions with respect to input image characteristics.

Sampling of the training and validation sets was performed using the methodology described in Section 3.3. We took into account the 5 known \"VGG\" model architectures, VGG-A to VGG-E starting from (3) and variations on each of the 5 VGG architectures, which included exposure and batch normalization layers.

None of these methods contains information about the true population figures for the target year, 2010, so the population must be derived either from detailed historical population and demographic data in the case of POSTCENSAL, supplementary survey information in the case of ACS5YEAR, or a combination of satellite and historical population data in the case of our methods CONVRAW and CONVAUG. We compare the predicted populations for all counties with any method taken from the base population and capture the mean absolute error (Mean AE), the mean absolute error (Median AE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results for this comparison can be found in Table 1, and the per county errors are illustrated in figure."}, {"heading": "4.2 Prediction Interpretability", "text": "Because we cover some population breakdown methods in Section 2, we rely on ad hoc rules to assign the population of an administrative area to the grid cells that cover the same area. In some applications, the methods for determining these rules or the rules themselves are available, while in other products, such as Landsat (30; 31), the methodology is not public, and therefore subsequent years of predictions are not comparable. Furthermore, while some basic dasymetric heuristics, such as \"people do not live on land where the slope is over 45,\" can be applied globally, more detailed heuristics may be region-specific. Our methodology circumvents these potential problems by generating the probability that a section of satellite imagery belongs to each population group, allowing us to show how confident our models are about a particular classification decision."}, {"heading": "4.3 Prediction Errors", "text": "In Figure 6, we show three of these cases: Oak Ridge National Laboratory inOak Ridge, TN, Anniston Army Depot in Anniston, AL, and Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL. These locations all share the property of having many man-made structures and signals of human activity, without the \"ground truth\" characterizing a population from the census data. Walt Disney World has many structures similar to those in high-population neighborhoods, and will therefore always be misclassified by a model based solely on satellite imagery as input. In these cases, a traditional, asymmetric modeling approach to population dispersion will have an advantage over our model, since such an expanded approach could easily include layers describing large layers containing the army images that do not constitute useful observations with other content."}, {"heading": "5 Future Work and Conclusion", "text": "Our goal in this work is to train convolutionary neural networks to create high-resolution, segmented population maps using exclusively satellite imagery, and then to validate the predictions of our model both quantitatively and qualitatively.
