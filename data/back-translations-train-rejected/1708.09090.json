We are experimenting with how these dialog variants can be realized using parameters for characters in dynamic open worlds. (Walker et al. 2013) generate expressions with PERSONAGE and require authors to select and edit automatically generated expressions for some scenes. A similar revision method could be applied to the output of the EST.As a potential future direction, we aim to explore the potential of applying this approach to games with expansive open worlds with non-player characters (NPCs) that come from different parts of the world and have different backgrounds, but currently all speak the same dialogue in the same way.While discussing above how our method could be used to generate the STEST- and WPCs, the WEST could also be used to generate a personal dialog according to the variants of the STEST- variants in its variants."}], "references": [{"title": "Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress", "author": ["Adams", "T.

Dialogue authoring in large games requires not only the creation of content, but the subtlety of its delivery which can vary from character to character. Manually authoring this dialogue can be tedious, time-consuming, or even altogether infeasible. The task becomes particularly intractable for games and stories with dynamic open worlds in which character parameters that should produce linguistic variation may change during gameplay or are decided procedurally at runtime. Short of writing all possible variants pertaining to all possible character parameters for all of a game\u2019s dialogue segments, authors working with highly dynamic systems currently have no recourse for producing the extent of content that would be required to account for all linguistically meaningful character states. As such, we find openworld games today filled with stock dialogue segments that are used repetitively by many characters without any linguistic variation, even in game architectures with rich character models that could give an actionable account of how their speech may vary (Klabunde 2013). Indeed, in general, we are building computational systems that, underlyingly, are far more expressive than can be manifested by current authoring practice. These concerns can also be seen in linear games, in which the number of Copyright c \u00a9 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Recent work explores the introduction of automatically authored dialogues using expressive natural language generation (NLG) engines, thus allowing for more content creation and the potential of larger story paths (Monfort, Stayton, and Campana 2014; Lin and Walker 2011; Cavazza and Charles 2005; Rowe, Ha, and Lester 2008). Figure 1: NLG pipeline method of the ES Translator. (Walker et al. 2013) explore using a dynamic and customizable NLG engine called PERSONAGE to generate a variety of character styles and realizations, as one way to help authors to reduce the authorial burden of writing dialogue instead of relying on scriptwriters. PERSONAGE is a parameterizable NLG engine grounded in the Big Five personality traits that provides a larger range of pragmatic and stylistic variations of a single utterance than other NLG engines (Mairesse and Walker 2011). In PERSONAGE, narrator\u2019s voice (or style to be conveyed) is controlled by a model that specifies values for different stylistic parameters (such as verbosity, syntactic complexity, and lexical choice). PERSONAGE requires hand crafted text plans, limiting not only the expressibility of the generations, but also the domain. (Reed et al. 2011) introduce SpyFeet: a mobile game to encourage physical activity which makes use of dynamic storytelling and interaction. A descendant of PERSONAGE, called SpyGen, is its NLG engine. The input to SpyGen is a text plan from Inform7, which acts as the content planner and manager.

Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, \u201cWhat a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds.\u201d The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese,of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, \u201cYou have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day, I think I will eat my cheese here\u201d the crow said, flying to a branch with a piece of cheese in her beak. A Fox observed her. \u201cI\u2019m going to set my wits to work to discover some way to get the cheese\u201d Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, \u201cWhat a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds.\u201d \u201cI am hugely flattered!\u201d said the Crow. \u201cLet me sing for you!\u201d Down came the cheese,of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, \u201cYou have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits.\u201d Figure 2: The Fox and The Crow allows any character personality to be used in any game situation. However their approach was not evaluated and it relied on game specific text plans. (Rishes et al. 2013) created a translator, called the ESTranslator (EST), which bridges a narrative representation produced by the annotation tool Scheherezade, to the representation required by PERSONAGE, thus not requiring the creation of text plans. Fig. 1 provides a high level view of the architecture of EST, described in more detail below. Scheherazade annotation facilitates the creation of a rich symbolic representation for narrative texts, using a schema known as the STORY INTENTION GRAPH or SIG (Elson and McKeown 2010; Elson 2012). A SIG represents the sequence of story events, as well as providing a rich representation of the intentions, beliefs, and motivations of story characters. The EST takes the SIG as input, and then converts the narrative into a format that PERSONAGE can utilize. However, the approach described in (Rishes et al. 2013) is limited to telling stories from the third person narrator perspective. This paper expands upon the EST to enable annotation of direct speech in Scheherazade, that can then be realized directly as character dialogue. We explore and implement a potential application to producing dialogue in game experiences for large, dynamic, or procedurally-generated open worlds, and present a pilot study on user perceptions of the personalities of story characters who use direct speech. The contributions of this work are: 1) we have can modify a single, underlying representation of narrative to adjust for direct speech and substitute character speaking styles; and 2) that we can perform this modeling on any domain.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
