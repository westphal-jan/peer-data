Their possible adoption as indicative air quality measurements devices poses new challenges due to the need to operate in continuous monitoring modes in uncontrolled environments. Several issues, including slow dynamics, continue to affect their real world performances. At the same time, the need for estimating pollutant concentrations on board the devices, espe- cially for wearables and IoT deployments, is becoming highly desirable. In this framework, several calibration approaches have been proposed and tested on a variety of proprietary devices and datasets; still, no thorough comparison is available to researchers. This work attempts a benchmarking of the most promising calibration algorithms according to recent literature with a focus on machine learning approaches. We test the techniques against absolute and dynamic performances, generalization capabilities and computational/storage needs using three different datasets sharing continuous monitoring operation methodology. Our results can guide researchers and engineers in the choice of optimal strategy. They show that non-linear multivariate techniques yield reproducible results, outperforming lin- ear approaches. Specifically, the Support Vector Regression method consistently shows good performances in all the considered scenarios. We highlight the enhanced suitability of shallow neural networks in a trade-off between performance and computational/storage needs. We confirm, on a much wider basis, the advantages of dynamic approaches with respect to static ones that only rely on instantaneous sensor array response. The latter have been shown to be best choice whenever prompt and precise response is needed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 08:53:15 GMT  (1043kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09175v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["s de vito", "e esposito", "m salvato", "o popoola", "f formisano", "r jones", "g di francia"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.09175"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.09175.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Calibrating chemical multisensory devices for real world applications: An in-depth comparison of quantitative Machine Learning approaches", "authors": ["S.

As mentioned above, there is currently no comprehensive comparison of the proposed architectures available, partly due to the lack of public data sets to work with. In this section, we present our comparative methodology, which is based on the availability of three different data sets. In addition to their dynamic expansion, a selection of the most promising machine learning techniques have been trained to estimate the concentration of different pollutants through the use of instant sensor reactions and, for dynamic architectures, their current trajectories. Specifically, in these cases, a small observation window including recent sensor reactions is used to train the model, taking into account the dynamic behavior of the sensors (see Figure 1)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Machine Learning Techniques", "text": "The machine learning (ML) methods we have considered for comparison purposes are among the most popular, including Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Regressors (SVR), Gaussian Processes Regressors (GPR), Multiple Linear Regressors (MLR) and Reservoir Computing (RC) along with their dynamic versions, which are obtained at the input by means of different Tapped Delay Lengths (TDL).The tapped delay allows for a temporal expansion of the inputs, which generate an observation window for machine learning technology, enabling the learning and use of knowledge about dynamic relationships between input (sensor reactions) and outputs.The techniques under consideration were analysed for their ability to provide a solution to the need for on-board implementation, as well as how well they meet EU requirements for accuracy and precision."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Computational Costs", "text": "The operating principles of machine learning algorithms include two main steps, which are a training phase where learning from the example rarely takes place, and an operational phase where the trained system enters input data and performs its estimates. However, in most applications, the training is performed only once for the entire operational lifecycle of the smart device, which usually requires the evaluation of hundreds or thousands of sensory data. In our specific case, machine learning algorithms are usually first trained using sensor responses to different air quality conditions for which reference data on pollutant concentrations are known. This phase is usually performed by dedicated systems. Operational life is started and the tuned machine learning algorithms are continuously fed sensor responses to perform assessments of pollutant concentrations."}, {"heading": "3.2 Datasets Description", "text": "The comparison was carried out using three different datasets: the first came from a specific use of multi-sensory devices (SNAQ systems, see [42] for a detailed description of the use) developed by the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences (CAS), Chemistry Department, University of Cambridge (UK); the second dataset came from a field use of multi-sensory devices located in a heavily polluted roadside within an Italian city; and finally, the third dataset was collected in a gas extraction platform of the ChemoSignals Laboratory at the BioCircuits Institute, University of California UCSD, USA."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 SNAQ Dataset", "text": "The passive multi-sensor device was equipped with the following sensors: \u2022 two different NO2 electrochemical (EC) sensor units (Alphasense NO2 \u2212 B4 hereinafter referred to as NO2 (A) and NO2 (B)); \u2022 one NO Alphasense EC sensor unit (Alphasense NO \u2212 B4); \u2022 two different O3 Alphasense EC sensor units (Alphasense O3 \u2212 B4 hereinafter referred to as O3 (A) and O3 (B)); \u2022 temperature and relative humidity (RH) sensor units; \u2022 wind speed and wind direction deviation; several instances of the multi-sensor were used within Cambridge city centre (UK) as part of a ubiquitous operation, one of which was located on the roof of the chemical department."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 ENEA Pirelli Dataset", "text": "The second dataset came from the source: https: / / archive.ics.uci.edu / ml / datasets / Air + Quality.

For the third set (UCSD), where reference concentrations change abruptly, we plotted the response to these concentration changes, allowing us to compare the static and dynamic approaches for fast transients.

multisensor devices need calibration algorithms to estimate gas concentrations. Their possible adoption as indicative air quality measurements devices poses new challenges due to the need to operate in continuous monitoring modes in uncontrolled environments. Several issues, including slow dynamics, continue to affect their real world performances. At the same time, the need for estimating pollutant concentrations on board the devices, especially for wearables and IoT deployments, is becoming highly desirable. In this framework, several calibration approaches have been proposed and tested on a variety of proprietary devices and datasets; still, no thorough comparison is available to researchers. This work attempts a benchmarking of the most promising calibration algorithms according to recent literature with a focus on machine learning approaches. We test the techniques against absolute and dynamic performances, generalization capabilities and computational/storage needs using three different datasets sharing continuous monitoring operation methodology. Our results can guide researchers and engineers in the choice of optimal strategy. They show that non-linear multivariate techniques yield reproducible results, outperforming linear approaches. Specifically, the Support Vector Regression method consistently shows good performances in all the considered scenarios. We highlight the enhanced suitability of shallow neural networks in a trade-off between performance and computational/storage needs. We confirm, on a much wider basis, the advantages of dynamic approaches with respect to static ones that only rely on instantaneous sensor array response. The latter have been shown to be best choice whenever prompt and precise response is needed.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
