Recently, a new family of optimization algorithms, named Quality-Diversity optimization, has been introduced, and contrasts with classic algorithms. Instead of searching for a single solution, Quality-Diversity algorithms are searching for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions. The role of this collection is to cover the range of possible solution types as much as possible, and to contain the best solution for each type. The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we present a unifying framework of Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms that covers the two main algorithms of this family (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites and the Novelty Search with Local Competition), and that highlights the large variety of variants that can be investigated within this family. Secondly, we propose algorithms with a new selection mechanism for Quality-Diversity algorithms that outperforms all the algorithms tested in this paper. Lastly, we present a new collection management that overcomes the erosion issues observed when using unstructured collections. These three contributions are supported by extensive experimental comparisons of Quality-Diversity algorithms on three different experimental scenarios.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 May 2017 13:38:08 GMT  (3415kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09251v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["antoine cully", "yiannis demiris"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.09251"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.09251.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Quality and Diversity Optimization: A Unifying Modular Framework", "authors": ["Antoine Cully", "Yiannis Demiris"], "emails": ["a.cully@imperial.ac.uk;", "y.demiris@imperial.ac.uk)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The search for high-quality solutions within a typically high-dimensional search space is an important part of engineering and research, but intensive work has been undertaken in recent decades to produce automated processes for generating these solutions, commonly referred to as \"optimization algorithms.\" Applications of such algorithms are numerous and range from modeling purposes to product design [1]. Recently, however, optimization algorithms have become the core of most machine learning techniques, used, for example, to adjust the weights of neural networks to minimize classification errors. [3] or to enable robots to learn new behaviors that maximize their speed or accuracy [4], [5].Inspired by the ability of natural evolution to produce species that are well adapted to their environment."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORKS AND DEFINITIONS", "text": "Although the concept of quality diversity is relatively new, finding multiple solutions to one problem has been a long-standing challenge."}, {"heading": "A. Searching for Local Optima", "text": "This challenge was initially solved by multimodal algorithms for function optimization, including nicking methods in Evolutionary Computation [19], [20], [21], which aim to find the local optimum of a function. However, these algorithms mainly incorporate niche and genotypical diversity conservation mechanisms [21], such as clustering [22] and clearing [23] methods. However, in many applications, some interesting solutions are not captured by the local optimum of the fitness function. For example, it is important that running robots are able to control walking speeds, but there is no guarantee that the performance function (i.e. walking speed [24], [25]) has local optima that is diverse enough to provide a full range of walking speeds. If the optimised function is monomodal (i.e. without local optima), the population will not necessarily control the behavioural modes based on the global optimum and the variety of walking speeds produced, as is required for them to do."}, {"heading": "B. Searching for Diverse Solutions", "text": "According to this idea of non-performance-oriented diversity, the novelty algorithm is simply unable to find solutions that differ from the previous ones without taking into account their quality. This concept is applied by optimizing a \"novelty value,\" which characterizes the difference of a solution compared to the previously mentioned solutions stored in a \"news archive.\" The novelty archive is independent of the population of the evolutionary algorithm. The novelty number is calculated as the average distance of the closest neighboring solutions located in the news archive, while the distances are calculated according to a user-defined solution."}, {"heading": "C. Gathering and Improving these Solutions into Collections", "text": "In fact, the goal of the new archive is to capture and capture the different types of solutions encountered throughout the process, including across the entire spectrum of the archive."}, {"heading": "D. Evolving the Collection", "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "E. Quality-Diversity Optimization", "text": "Based on the groundbreaking work previously presented [14], [15], [13] and the formulation by Pugh et al. [16], [17], we can outline a common definition: Definition II.1: Optimization of Quality and Diversity An optimization algorithm of quality and diversity aims to produce a large collection of solutions that are both diverse and powerful and cover a specific area, the so-called descriptor space. Although this definition is shared with existing literature, we also emphasize the importance of the regularity of the collections produced. In the vast majority of previously presented applications, not only the coverage is important, but also their uniformity. For example, in the locomotion tasks an even coverage of all possible rotational capabilities of the robot is required to enable the execution of arbitrary trajectories [29]. Based on this definition, the overall performance of a QDalgorithm is defined by the quality of the solutions created according to the individual criteria: the coverage of the 1) and the coverage of the coverage of the 3)."}, {"heading": "F. Understanding the Underlying Mechanisms", "text": "In addition to direct applications, several other studies have focused on studying the properties of QD algorithms. For example, Lehman et al. [37] have shown that extinction events (i.e. the deletion of a significant portion of the collection) increase the evolutionary capacity of solutions [38] and enable the process to find more efficient solutions thereafter. In other studies, Pugh et al. [16] have increased the effects of alignment between the solution descriptor and the quality assessment of the two novelty-based approaches by 50% [37]. In other studies, Pugh et al. [17] have analyzed the effects of alignment."}, {"heading": "III. A UNITED AND MODULAR FRAMEWORK FOR QD-OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS", "text": "As shown in the previous section, most works with or without QD algorithms consider either MAP elites or NSLC-based algorithms, or direct comparisons of these two algorithms. These comparisons are relevant because of the different origins of these two algorithms. However, they only offer a high level of knowledge and do not provide insight into the properties or peculiarities that make one algorithm better than the other. In this section, we can introduce a new and common framework for QD algorithms that can be instantiated with other operators, such as the selection or aggregation of operators that are similar to most evolutionary algorithms."}, {"heading": "A. Containers", "text": "One of the main differences between MAP elites and NSLC is the way in which the collection of solutions is usually formed. Whereas MAP elites rely on an N-dimensional grid, NSLC uses an unstructured archive based on the Euclidean distance between solution descriptors. [15] These two different approaches represent two different container types. Below, we will discuss their implementation and particularities.1) The Grid: MAP elite uses an N-dimensional grid to shape the collection of solutions. [15] The descriptor space is discredited and the different dimensions of the grid correspond to the dimensions of the solution descriptor. With this discretization, each cell of the grid represents a type of cells. In the first works, each ZAP can imagine itself as an individual."}, {"heading": "B.

EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISONS", "text": "To compare the different combinations of containers and selection operators, we consider three experimental scenarios that take place in simulations: 1) a highly redundant robotic arm that finds out how to reach points in its environment, 2) a virtual 9-legged robot that learns to walk in any direction, and 3) the same robot that searches for a large number of ways to walk in a straight line. In addition to the tested combinations of containers and selection operators, we include the original novelty search algorithm with local competition (NSLC, [14]) in our experimental comparisons to assess the influence of the lack of density accumulation in the descriptor space, as discussed in Section III-A3. How in [16] all individuals of the population are potentially added to a grid container (the same as the one used with the other variants), according to each generation. We then used the produced grid container to compare NSLC with the other variants."}, {"heading": "A. Quality Metrics", "text": "In order to compare the quality of the collections produced by each variant, we define four quality indicators that characterize both the scope and the performance of the solutions: 1) Survey quantity: indicates the number of solutions contained in the collection and thus refers to the proportion of the descriptor space covered by the collection. 2) Maximum quality: corresponds to the quality of the best solution contained in the collection and indicates whether the global extreme of the performance function has been found (if it is known). 3) Total quality: is the sum of the qualities across all the solutions contained in the collection. This indicator provides information on the global quality of the collection, since it can be improved either by finding additional individuals or by improving the ones already contained in the collection. It corresponds to the \"quality diversity\" indicator used in [16]. 4) Total Novelty: This indicator is comparable to the previous one, except that the sum takes into account the novelty evaluation and not the quality value."}, {"heading": "B. The Redundant Arm", "text": "1) Experimental Setup: In this first experimental comparison, we look at a redundant and planar robotic arm with 8 degrees of freedom, which must figure out how to reach each point in its environment. Quality Function captures the idea that all joints of the robot should contribute equally to the movement that allows fast transitions from one configuration to the next. This limitation is defined by the variance of the angular position of the joints when the robot reaches its final configuration, and must be minimized by the algorithm. This experimental setup illustrates the need for a population diversity of algorithms, because it must simultaneously find a solution for all achievable positions and optimize the quality function for each of the robotic arms. 10 To simulate its kinematic structure, we look at the position of its gripper to be optimized according to the angular position of all joints."}, {"heading": "C. The Robot Walking in Every Direction", "text": "The aim of the QD algorithms is to produce a collection of behaviors that allow the robot to move in any direction."}, {"heading": "D. The Robot Walking with Different Gaits", "text": "In this case, the robot has to learn a large collection of people who are in contact with the ground. Therefore, the descriptive space is larger than ever before."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION", "text": "In this paper, we presented three new papers. Firstly, we introduced a new framework combining QD algorithms, showing, for example, that MAP elites and novelty search with local competition are two different configurations of the same algorithm. Secondly, we proposed a new archive management method that addresses the erosion problems observed with the previous approaches. This new method demonstrates good results. These p-values do not reject the null hypothesis, which is based on the HolmBonferroni method with an \u03b1 = 0.05, but reject it with \u03b1 = 0.1, as it allows the algorithms to produce unstructured collections with the same range as those with lattice containers, which was not the case with the previous management method. Finally, we proposed a new selective pressure specific to QDalgorithms."}, {"heading": "VI. QUALITY DIVERSITY LIBRARY", "text": "The source code of the QD Algorithm Framework is available at https: / / github.com / sferes2 / modular QD. It is based on the Sferesv2 Framework [47] and implements both grid-based and archive-based containers and multiple selection operators, including all those evaluated in this essay. The source code of the experimental setups is available in the same place and can be used by interested readers to examine and evaluate new QD algorithms. The implementation allows researchers to easily implement and evaluate new operator combinations while maintaining high execution speed.For this reason, we followed the policy-based design in C + + + [49], which allows developers to simply replace the behavior of the program by changing the template declarations of the algorithm. Switching from the grid-based container to the archive-based container template does not require, for example, the classic archive container:"}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This work was supported by the EU project Horizon2020 PAL (643783-RIA) and the authors thank the members of the Personal Robotics Lab for their support."}], "references": [{"title": "Practical optimization: algorithms and engineering applications", "author": ["A.

solution according to one or several objectives has a central role in many engineering and research fields. Recently, a new family of optimization algorithms, named Quality-Diversity optimization, has been introduced, and contrasts with classic algorithms. Instead of searching for a single solution, Quality-Diversity algorithms are searching for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions. The role of this collection is to cover the range of possible solution types as much as possible, and to contain the best solution for each type. The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we present a unifying framework of Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms that covers the two main algorithms of this family (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites and the Novelty Search with Local Competition), and that highlights the large variety of variants that can be investigated within this family. Secondly, we propose algorithms with a new selection mechanism for Quality-Diversity algorithms that outperforms all the algorithms tested in this paper. Lastly, we present a new collection management that overcomes the erosion issues observed when using unstructured collections. These three contributions are supported by extensive experimental comparisons of Quality-Diversity algorithms on three different experimental scenarios.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
