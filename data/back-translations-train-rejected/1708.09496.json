Cognitive theories of narrative understanding define these inferences as four different types of causality, that include pairs of events A, B where A physically causes B (X drop, X break), to pairs of events where A causes emotional state B (Y saw X, Y felt fear). Previous work on learning narrative relations from text has either focused on \"strict\" physical causality, or has been vague about what relation is being learned. This paper learns pairs of causal events from a corpus of film scene descriptions which are action rich and tend to be told in chronological order. We show that event pairs induced using our methods are of high quality and are judged to have a stronger causal relation than event pairs from Rel-grams.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 22:51:08 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09496v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhichao hu", "marilyn a walker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.09496"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.09496.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Inferring Narrative Causality between Event Pairs in Films", "authors": ["Zhichao Hu", "Marilyn A.

Movies can belong to several genres, for example, the scenes from The Fellowship of the Ring shown in Figure 1 would become part of the action, adventure and fantasy genres. Scene descriptions of each film range from 2000 to 35,000 words. Table 1 lists the size of each genre and illustrates the potential compromise between good estimates of probability of event coincidences when the same events occur within a genre over the entire corpus.

We show that people can identify different types of narrative causal relationships, but we leave the automatic identification to this future work. We also show that the induction of narrative causal relationships using both whole corpus and genre-specific methods yields similar results in terms of quality, despite the smaller size of the genre-specific subcorpus. Furthermore, the genre-specific method learns high-quality event pairs that differ from event pairs throughout the corpus. We investigate the application and evaluation of our CPC method to other genre-specific subcorpus narratives, and we may wish to contribute to the understanding of potential event pairings as well as our personal data sets and specific blog posts."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research was supported by Nuance Foundation Grant SC-14-74, NSF # IIS-1302668-002, NSF CISE CreativeIT # IIS-1002921 and NSF CISE RI EAGER # IIS-1044693."}], "references": [{"title": "Rel-grams: a probabilistic model of relations in text", "author": ["Niranjan Balasubramanian", "Stephen Soderland", "Oren Etzioni"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Automatic Knowledge Base Construction and Web-scale Knowledge Extraction", "citeRegEx": "Balasubramanian et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Balasubramanian et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Generating coherent event schemas at scale", "author": ["Niranjan Balasubramanian", "Stephen Soderland", "Oren Etzioni Mausam", "Oren Etzioni."], "venue": "EMNLP. pages 1721\u20131731.", "citeRegEx": "Balasubramanian et al\\.,? 2013b", "shortCiteRegEx": "Balasubramanian et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Using a bigram event model to predict causal potential", "author": ["Brandon Beamer", "Roxana Girju."], "venue": "Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing, Springer, pages 430\u2013441.", "citeRegEx": "Beamer and Girju.,? 2009", "shortCiteRegEx": "Beamer and Girju.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Unsupervised learning of narrative event chains", "author": ["Nathanael Chambers", "Dan Jurafsky."], "venue": "Proceedings of ACL-08: HLT pages 789\u2013797.", "citeRegEx": "Chambers and Jurafsky.,? 2008", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chambers and Jurafsky.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Unsupervised learning of narrative schemas and their participants", "author": ["Nathanael Chambers", "Dan Jurafsky."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 47th Annual Meeting of the ACL. pages 602\u2013610.", "citeRegEx": "Chambers and Jurafsky.,? 2009", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chambers and Jurafsky.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Verbocean: Mining the web for fine-grained semantic verb relations", "author": ["Timothy Chklovski", "Patrick Pantel."], "venue": "EMNLP. volume 4, pages 33\u201340.", "citeRegEx": "Chklovski and Pantel.,? 2004", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chklovski and Pantel.", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Skimming Stories in Real Time: An Experiment in Integrated Understanding", "author": ["G.F. de Jong."], "venue": "Ph.D. thesis, Computer Science Department, Yale University.", "citeRegEx": "Jong.,? 1979", "shortCiteRegEx": "Jong.", "year": 1979}, {"title": "Minimally supervised event causality identification", "author": ["Quang Xuan Do", "Yee Seng Chan", "Dan Roth."], "venue": "Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

Cognitive theories of narrative understanding define these inferences as four different types of causality, that include pairs of events A, B where A physically causes B (X drop, X break), to pairs of events where A causes emotional state B (Y saw X, Y felt fear). Previous work on learning narrative relations from text has either focused on \u201cstrict\u201d physical causality, or has been vague about what relation is being learned. This paper learns pairs of causal events from a corpus of film scene descriptions which are action rich and tend to be told in chronological order. We show that event pairs induced using our methods are of high quality and are judged to have a stronger causal relation than event pairs from Rel-grams.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
