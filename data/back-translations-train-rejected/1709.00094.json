Appraisal theory grounds our emotional responses in our goals and desires and their fulfillment, or lack of fulfillment. Self Determination theory posits that the basis for well-being rests on our assessment of our competence, autonomy, and social connection. And surveys that measure happiness empirically note that people require their basic needs to be met for food and shelter, but beyond that tend to be happiest when socializing, eating or having sex. We analyze a corpus of private microblogs from a well-being application called ECHO, where users label each written post about daily events with a happiness score between 1 and 9. Our goal is to ground the linguistic descriptions of events that users experience in theories of well-being and happiness, and then examine the extent to which different theoretical accounts can explain the variance in the happiness scores. We show that recurrent event types, such as OBLIGATION and INCOMPETENCE, which affect people's feelings of well-being are not captured in current lexical or semantic resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 22:03:53 GMT  (123kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00094v1", "11 pages, 8th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis (WASSA 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 8th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis (WASSA 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jiaqi wu", "marilyn walker", "pranav anand", "steve whittaker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00094"}, "pdf": {"name": "1709.00094.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Linguistic Reflexes of Well-Being and Happiness in Echo", "authors": ["Jiaqi Wu", "Marilyn Walker", "Pranav Anand", "Steve Whittaker"], "emails": ["jwu64@ucsc.edu", "mawalker@ucsc.edu", "panand@ucsc.edu", "swhittak@ucsc.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "2 Background and Motivation", "text": "The aim is to motivate people to react to everyday events and to regularly reflect on past events (Isaacs et al., 2013).

In addition, we have shown that each of these methods can perform similar services to traditional lexical methods with a smaller and, in the case of FrameNet functions, psychologically grounded feature space. Furthermore, our autoslog exploration shows a way to explore the space of patterns that our FrameNet mapping has missed. In future work, we will strive to automatically combine these two methods and bring the autoslog patterns under the asymmetric categorization that we advocate. We also plan to examine new models that are uniquely identified with the 6 larger echoes that we have not directly tested."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was partially supported by NSF Robust Intelligence # IIS-1302668-002 and NSF HCC # IIS-1321102."}], "references": [{"title": "Sentiwordnet 3.0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining", "author": ["Stefano Baccianella", "Andrea Esuli", "Fabrizio Sebastiani"], "venue": "In LREC", "citeRegEx": "Baccianella et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baccianella et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Getting the roles right: Using framenet in nlp", "author": ["Colin Baker", "Nathan Schneider", "Miriam R L Petruck", "Michael Ellsworth."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2015 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguis-", "citeRegEx": "Baker et al\\.,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baker et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Framenet: A knowledge base for natural language processing", "author": ["Collin Baker."], "venue": "Proceedings of Frame Semantics in NLP: A Workshop in Honor of Chuck Fillmore (19292014).

Appraisal theory grounds our emotional responses in our goals and desires and their fulfillment, or lack of fulfillment. Self-Determination theory posits that the basis for well-being rests on our assessments of our competence, autonomy and social connection. And surveys that measure happiness empirically note that people require their basic needs to be met for food and shelter, but beyond that tend to be happiest when socializing, eating or having sex. We analyze a corpus of private micro-blogs from a well-being application called ECHO, where users label each written post about daily events with a happiness score between 1 and 9. Our goal is to ground the linguistic descriptions of events that users experience in theories of well-being and happiness, and then examine the extent to which different theoretical accounts can explain the variance in the happiness scores. We show that recurrent event types, such as OBLIGATION and INCOMPETENCE, which affect people\u2019s feelings of well-being are not captured in current lexical or semantic resources.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
