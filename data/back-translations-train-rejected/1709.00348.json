We analyze a dataset of detailed device network activity obtained from 240 subscriber homes of a large European ISP and extract a number of traffic and spatial fingerprints for individual devices. We develop a two level taxonomy to describe devices onto which we map individual devices using a number of heuristics. We leverage the heuristically derived labels to train classifiers that distinguish device classes based on the traffic and spatial fingerprints of a device. Our results show an accuracy level up to 91% for the coarse level category and up to 84% for the fine grained category. By incorporating information from other sources (e.g., MAC OUI), we are able to further improve accuracy to above 97% and 92%, respectively. Finally, we also extract a set of simple and human-readable rules that concisely capture the behaviour of these distinct device categories.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 14:47:23 GMT  (383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00348v1", "14 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.AI", "authors": ["kyumars sheykh esmaili", "jaideep chandrashekar", "pascal le guyadec"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00348"}, "pdf": {"name": "1709.00348.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Inferring Networked Device Categories from Low-Level Activity Indicators", "authors": ["Kyumars Sheykh Esmaili", "Jaideep Chandrashekar", "Pascal Le Guyadec"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

DATASET", "text": "The 240 households included in our dataset were subscribers to a (single) major European ISP during the specified period and were recruited for a test deployment. Home gateways in these households were identical to all other subscribers, except for one aspect: in-use gateways routinely queried a number of software counters and state variables on the gateway and reported them to a back-end server. Home gateways, spanning four different hardware models, were designed for triple-play service (voice, broadband, IPTV) and had 4 physical Ethernet ports and an 802.11b / g / n 2x2 WiFi access point. Importantly, the WiFi access point was available throughout the test period and during the entire test operation."}, {"heading": "3.1 Collected Raw Metrics", "text": "In most cases, most of them are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves, and they are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "4.

EXTRACTING FEATURES", "text": "In this section, we analyze the time series of hit and wireless metrics, and then construct a set of characteristics that are suitable for input into a class system. We use the term feature class to describe a specific, possibly post-edited metric that is collected by the gateways and from which a distribution is built, and the feature to refer to a specific c attribute extracted for that feature class. As an example, Daily Tra c Volume is a timeline and a feature class, while the mean daily tra c volume is a feature. Below, we go through each feature class and describe how it is processed. In selecting these characteristics, we rely on a combination of common best practices and also on intuition gained from initial explorations of the dataset. The complete set of 92 characteristics associated with each individual device is summarized in Table 3 (a)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Feature Classes", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "5.2 Feature Analysis", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "6.

Manufacturers vary greatly in the number of device types they manufacture. On the one hand, Apple builds devices that cover all coarse-grained device classes (and here the OUI is unlikely to have significant discriminatory power); on the other, Roku manufactures exactly one type of device, an OTT box; here the OUI completely determines the device class. Most manufacturers fall somewhere within this spectrum, and this can be used to improve the precision of the classification. It is very important to point out that the correlation between OUI and the category of data correlation is not very general."}, {"heading": "6.4 Human-Readable Behavior Inference", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules we have set ourselves, \"he said in an interview with the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.\" It's not as if we are able to hide, \"he said.\" But it's not as if we are able to hide. \""}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we described a methodology for identifying the category of a connected device based on low indicators of network activity on home Internet gateways. We analyzed in detail a dataset of 240 participant homes and extracted a set of characteristics that concisely capture the behavior of the devices in our dataset (which were then extensively checked by manual inspections), and then experimented with a number of well-known classification methods to predict the labels we had previously received. Overall, we found that the coarse-grained marking of a class can be derived with very high accuracy."}, {"heading": "8. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] D. Allan.
