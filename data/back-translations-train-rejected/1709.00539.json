DISC [1] theory is a model that is proposed by William Moulton Marston, and is widely used in the industry for such a classification of personalities.DISC theory is widely used in the industry [2] due to its simple management as a test that can be of the form of a formal test or an informal test. Formal test conditions include a questionnaire format and basic case studies. Informal tests include approaches such as gamification using websites [3] or the use of datamining techniques as a test. DISC theory stands for the four main types of personalities in which individuals can be placed, mainly the dominant personality type, influence personality type, steady personality and compliance personality type."}, {"heading": "LITREATURE REVIEW", "text": "Automated systems using simple mathematical formulas have been proposed in the past [10,11, 12], but the main case with such systems is the lack of elasticity of the models; the hypothesis proposed for such approaches is quite rigid, whereas a neural network-based model is malleable and able to adapt to circumstances both locally and globally; the personnel-based classification of potential employees and team members has been used to predict whether the potential candidate would fit into a group and whether or not he would be productive; the associated business value of a candidate is often measured by the psychometric characteristics owned by a person [13]; the leadership of an organization is expected to have some quality characteristics [14], such as the active type in their personality, in order to proactively lead the organization to success [15]. DISC-based systems are also used in other applications, such as tailored teaching for students [11] and adapting treatment methods."}, {"heading": "PROPOSED MODEL", "text": "Test values derived from a standardized test [6] are used to train the prediction engine, and the results are presented on the basis of six attributes: belief, determination, adaptability, dominance, ambition, and emotional management. The structure of this feature vector is shown in Figure 2. Test values are scaled to be between 0 and 10 units, due to the fact that the neural networks are scalable or even zero when the compatibility of the recruits and manager assigned is taken into account and merged to form an input vector of the dimensions that give a binary vector that is compatible or zero when the synthetic data is shaped by creating a dataset in which the data is filled out according to a discrete, uniform distribution of the data, ensuring that the data is consistent with the real life values. The distribution is centred on a value of five (the mean value in each)."}, {"heading": "EXPERIMENT AND RESULT DISCUSSION", "text": "The model of the prediction machine is a multi-layer perceptron network [19], consisting of 4 layers of 64 nodes each, the model is trained until the accuracy converges, the structure is shown in Figure 3.The nodes are tightly connected, i.e. each node in layer (n-1) is connected to each node in layer (s).The data has been divided into training and test data at a ratio of 8: 2, with 20% of the data being used as test data and the remaining 80% as training data. Training data has been further divided into training data and validation data at a ratio of 8: 2. As a result of the double division of training data, the actual data used to train the neural network is represented as compatibility with only 64% of the actual amount of data. Adapting the model to the prediction data until the convergence of the weights, the accuracy of the test data can be divided at a ratio of 8: 2, with the actual data used to train the neural network."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This behaviour is reflected in the precision, memory and f1 values of the dataset shown in Table 1. Multi-layer neural perceptron network is a simple model that performs the work required in comparison to other neural network frameworks such as recurring neural networks or convolution neural networks. Multilayer neural perceptron network learning capability is represented by the accuracy and precision value of the model. Although the problem is the shape of a class imbalance, the multi-layer neural perceptron network works very well and has good precision, memory and f1 score.In addition, the model can be adapted to real-world data to mimic complex patterns that allow the neural network to predict the compatibility of individuals well."}, {"heading": "FUTURE WORK", "text": "Various advances in neural networks have been made, and the complexity of networks could be reduced by adding folding nodes instead of simple perceptron nodes, as they reduce the number of updates needed to achieve accuracy. Other approaches, such as unattended learning with self-organizing maps to understand how the machine learns to classify individuals into different personality categories based on their abilities, could be beneficial to reduce misclassification errors. Extreme learning can be used in future research to further shorten the training time for the algorithm and reduce the number of updates to the nodes. The structure of artificial neural network nodes, as well as other features, could be added to the input vectors to increase efficiency."}], "references": [{"title": "Emotions of Normal People", "author": ["F.
