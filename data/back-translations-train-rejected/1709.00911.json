INTRODUCTIONThe recent outbreak of the use of artificial neural network technologies (ANN) has had an impact on applications such as autonomous driving. Although the use of ANN-based techniques has been promising compared to classical approaches (e.g. much better image recognition [6]), there have been enormous barriers to the use of neural networks in safety-critical areas (e.g. NASA report [2]). In this paper, we propose a methodology to enable the use of ANN by considering reasonable enhancements to existing safety standards (Section II). We examine the technological readiness of our proposed methodology by applying a case study predicting motorway movements for autonomous driving (Section III), and address further research needs (Section IV)."}, {"heading": "II. CERTIFICATION CONSIDERATIONS FOR DEPENDABLE NEURAL NETWORKS", "text": "To answer this question, it is necessary for EU member states to be able to take the necessary measures to solve the problem."}, {"heading": "III. CASE STUDY: HIGHWAY MOTION PREDICTION FOR", "text": "AUTONOMOUS VEHICLESWe outline how we use the above strategy in reviewing a highway that uses ANN-based motion predictor in autonomous driving (developed by Lenz et al. [7]). Figure 1 provides a snapshot of the simulation of the vehicle. In Figure 1, the ANN-based predictor takes three categories of input factors: (i) its own speed profile, (ii) parameters of its closest surrounding vehicles for each orientation, and (ii) the state of the road. The total number of input variables in the network is 84. Given the current state of the perceived environment, it produces in real time the probability distribution of all possible measures for a vehicle, characterized as a Gaussian mixing model. The action of the first-person vehicle is divided into two parts: (i) indicator of possible lateral speed (i.e., if it is possible to change runways), and (ii) indicator of acceleration via the accelerator."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS", "text": "The proposed certification method has also identified further research needs during the case study. (i) During the study, we found that the comprehensibility of implementation can only be partially achieved through technologies such as deconvolution [8]. (ii) The scalability of automated verification requires improvements (see Table II for the required verification time). Recent results on quantified neural networks [5] could improve the scalability of verification by coding to bit vector theories in SMT [4]. (iii) Besides verification, another important direction is to consider training on known characteristics of the target function (known as clues [1]), such as security rules."}], "references": [{"title": "Hints", "author": ["Y.S.
