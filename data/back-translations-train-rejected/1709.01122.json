M, where 1.. M is short for {1,.., M), each of these variables is applied to a possible number of x-negative real numbers that represents how likely the assignment xi is. This representation is called factorization because it breaks the common probability into this product. In Bayesian networks, M = N and factors are conditional probabilities."}, {"heading": "2.2 Probabilistic Inference Modulo Theories", "text": "This requires a variable elimination in order to be able to access all random variables in a sum formula across all mappings, as shown in the example for calculating numbers (t) with variable elimination. However, the definitions of factors in the form of symbolic algebraic expressions used by operators from specific theories could be presented as an example of the conditional probability of temperature in the given month and the previous probability of the month in our original example.

While this form does not prelude regular PU to access it as a search table (by calculating its result to an assignment andm), the symbolic expression itself is available as a structure."}, {"heading": "2.3 Relational Graphical Models", "text": "Relational Graphic Models (RGM) specify probability distributions over families of random variables that can be considered as relations. There are many RGM languages in literature; they vary significantly in syntax and superficial characteristics, but are typically equivalent and convertible to each other. Markov Logic Networks (MLN) (Bob, 2004) is a well-known one. It consists of a number of weight formulas, an example of which is 2,5: smoker (Bob) 1,4: smoker (X), friends (X, Y) \u21d2 smoker (Y) for logical variables X and Y, which have a finite setD = {Ann, Bob, Charlie,..}.The random variables in this MLN are the foundations or instantiations of relationships therein for any assignment to the logical variables: Sm (Ann), Sm (Bob), Sm (Bob), Sm (Bob), Sexptim (Bob),"}, {"heading": "3 INVERSION AND INVERSION MODULO THEORIES", "text": "In this section, the main contributions of this paper are presented: We introduce a new formulation for RGMs and inversion that is more algebraic, and then use this formulation to generalize the inversion to inversion modulo theories."}, {"heading": "3.1 RGMS with Function-Valued Random Variables", "text": "While the RGM literature considers Sm (Ann), Sm (Bob),.. as individual (Boolean) random variables, it is conceptually simpler and mathematically standard to talk about Sm as a single random variable that has a random function value. However, from this point of view, this MLN has only two random variables: Sm and Fr, and defines the following common probability distribution: P (Sm, Fr) = 1Z x (Sm (Bob)) \u00d7 X (D, Y).Note that considering the form of P (Sm, Y), Sm (Y), where Z is defined as usual, as well as marginalization: P (Sm) = Fr (D) \u00b7 D \u2192 BooleanP (Sm, Fr).Note that considering the form of P (Sm, Fr), the marginal probabilities in RGMs are a sum of factors, including more intensive products, that replace this function (SFm)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Inversion on Function-Valued Variables", "text": "It involves a few operations, but in this essay we consider only one: inversion (also referred to as lifted decomposition).Inversion uses the fact that a summation of products becomes a cheaper product of a summation (both together), i.e. \"inversion\" of the quantifiers.

(This is a version of the probability theory raised, which is not able to cover all sorts of problems where one has to fall back on the methods currently used.) Future work involves generalizing other methods raised, such as counting (de Salvo Braz, 2007), to also cover the modulo theories, thereby reducing the need for the fallback methods. (This allows the inversion condition of a syntactic check.) Once we allow the function of the theory, these syntactic tests are no longer applied, as the arguments are applicable to the respective theory."}, {"heading": "3.4 Dealing with Arbitrary Domains for f", "text": "Theory3.3 assumes that A = OCf, that is, that the domain of f corresponds to its share used within b. If A 6 = OCf is used, we use function division (Section 3.1): A = OCf, that is, that the domain of f corresponds to its share used within b (OCf). If A 6 = OCf, we use function division (Section 3.1): A = OCf, that is, that the domain of f corresponds to its share (A\\ OCf)."}, {"heading": "3.6 A Proof-of-concept Experiment", "text": "Since SEMT and inversion modulo theories are sophisticated symbolic algorithms, two immediate questions are whether they can be implemented effectively and how they can be compared with simpler alternatives such as sampling. As a proof-of-concept test, we used our implementation of SEMT to calculate Example 3.4, using two alternatives: one where the sum product is simplified by inversion modulo theories, and another where sum and product are calculated by sampling. As expected, the inversion modulo theories far exceed the sample in this example by calculating the exact response (82590) in less than 300 ms, while the sample takes 10 minutes and 10,000 samples per quantifier to be within an order of magnitude of the exact answer, and 17 minutes to be within a 10% error."}, {"heading": "4 RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSION", "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, LPIMT generalizes work in upscale inference, probabilistic inference, and the satisfaction of modular theories. It also refers to probabilistic programs (PP) (Goodman et al., 2012; Milch et al., 2005), a class of high-level representations that use interpreted and uninterpreted functions. Currently, the dominant inference method in PPs is sampling, whose convergence depends on the size of the grounded model, that is, on the size of the domain. LPIMT can be applied to some fragments of the PPs and is an exact inference alternative that avoids iteration across the domain."}, {"heading": "A SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission meets the EU Commission.
