Here, we provide evidence that the VM is written in natural language by establishing a relation of the Voynich alphabet and the Iranian Pahlavi script. Many of the Voynich characters are upside-down versions of their Pahlavi counterparts, which may be an effect of different writing directions. Other Voynich letters can be explained as ligatures or departures from Pahlavi with the intent to cope with known problems due to the stupendous ambiguity of Pahlavi text. While a translation of the VM text is not attempted here, we can confirm the Voynich-Pahlavi relation at the character level by the transcription of many words from the VM illustrations and from parts of the main text. Many of the transcribed words can be identified as terms from Zoroastrian cosmology which is in line with the use of Pahlavi script in Zoroastrian communities from medieval times.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 00:15:37 GMT  (5633kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01634v1", "23 pages, 15 figure, 4 tables"], ["v2", "Fri, 6 Oct 2017 16:52:11 GMT  (5634kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01634v2", "23 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables.

By introducing a number of additional characters, e.g. to distinguish d, g, n, reading a Voynichese text may have been easier than reading a Pahlavi text. It is not clear why the history of deciphering the VM does not support this claim. Bax [3], in analyzing plant and star names, has suggested a similar reading for some, but not all, letters. We base our transcription on a larger number of samples from the manuscript and compare the results with names from the Zoroastrian cosmological writing Bundahesh [23, 11], which was written in the 11th century, and with general vocabulary [13], so that we arrive at a more complete and reliable transcription, not only based on the similarity of letter forms."}, {"heading": "3.1 Zodiac symbols", "text": "In the appendix we show two sets of words from the manuscript: The first (App. A) indicates the names of the zodiac symbols and the corresponding month names, both handed down in the Bundahesh [23, 11] in paragraphs II, 2 and XXV, 20. Based on the known symbols in the centres f70v1 - f73v, the identification with the Pahlavi names is unambiguous, we expect for the two sides f71r and f72r1, which show the same symbols (Aries and Taurus) as f70v1 and f71v respectively. We cannot answer the question whether the two repeated symbols actually represent the missing Capricorn and Aquarius. Since two words (on f72r2 and f72v2) are illegible due to folds, we are left with 18 words that can be identified with a reasonable degree of certainty."}, {"heading": "3.2 Plant names", "text": "Ancient plant names come in a variety of varieties and are often ambiguous. The same seems to apply to plant drawings in the VM, where in some cases it even seems plausible that the artist merely followed a verbal description and not his own view or any original drawings. Therefore, we can expect that only a few characteristics are identifiable. Furthermore, only a few plant names are included in the standard dictionaries (e.g. [13]), so that most plant representations of the VM require further research. First, let us consider two plants (weevil and cannabis) whose names are easily identifiable and where a visual comparison, see Fig. 1, can be regarded as additional evidence of text-based identification. Afterwards, we will report on some preliminary experiments, i.e. we will not attempt botanical identification of the plants [22] and should bear in mind that the drawings themselves are far from perfect in comparison with other medieval representations."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Henbane", "text": "The first word of f31r is BccNcy, which can be transcribed as a bang, see Tab. 1, which [13] clearly translates as henbane (hyoscyamus niger), a poisonous plant of the nightshade family. The similarity of the drawing on f31r to the plant henbane is illustrated in Figure 1 and can be seen as additional evidence for the translation."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Cannabis", "text": "The first word of f16r is \u0161coN, which can be transcribed as \u0161a \u0435n, see Tab. 1, which [13] clearly translates as hemp (cannabis). The similarity of the drawing on f16r to the cannabis plant is obvious: the leaves are neither clearly opposite nor alternating, they are demonstrably made up of seven to nine finger-shaped leaflets. The thorn-shaped flowers are probably female and interspersed with elongated leaflets, see Fig. 2."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Further observations on the plant pages", "text": "Among the first words on the plant pages, we often find \u0161P \u0435g (seedling), da \u30fb n (grain) or da \u0441r (tree), which may be a general term or component of a plant name that consists of more than one word. E.g., on f17r we find don (da \u0435n), which can refer to buckwheat here. Folio 21r shows a plant that resembles the letter (buxus) or P \u0161im\u0161a \u00b8 r. The first word of the text is Sor (\u0161a \u0440r). At the end of the 7th line we find \u0161om\u0161or (with the middle m and \u0161 as a strange ligature). The first word of Folio 24r can be read as ala-lag, which would mean anemone (anemone blanda (?)), but the picture hardly matches the second line, although the anemone family has a large variety of leaf shapes and numbers."}, {"heading": "3.2.4 Plant parts", "text": "Folio 100r gives an overview of form types, most likely sheets. It contains six descriptive words for five images, see fig. 3. Therefore, we consider the first word in the top row (do-sp-\u0131g, i.e. double spout) to be the last word of the previous text. The second word in the top row Mht could be mih (wrong, opposite) or mahist (largest). The four words in the second row are less ambiguous. We have B\u0131 or (bahr, part) for a leaf consisting of three parts, Rotten (ro-d, flow) for a series of leaf stalks branching off like a river delta, t\u0161hg, which can refer to (ta\u0161t, bowl), and Botr (BATR, a heterogram for pas [13], behind) for a leaf left behind the other one. Again, this is proof of our main hypothesis and should not be considered an exercise in transcription."}, {"heading": "3.3 Lunar mansions", "text": "Similarly, it is possible to transcribe most of the 28 lunar mansions listed in Bundahesh II, 2 [11] from the illustration on f69v. Due to the short and repeated Pahlavi names of the mansions, an unambiguous agreement was possible for only 20 of the mansions, so we have not included them here. Interestingly, the stone representation of the Suzhou constellation chart (1193) from 1247, which shows the associated 28 Chinese constellations, has a \"cartouche title,\" which begins with the celestial ideogram, which can also be seen in a corrupted and inverted form on f1r the VM. This is not improbable given the constant exchange between Persia and China in historical times."}, {"heading": "3.4 Zoroastrian material", "text": "The four words at the center of f67v2 are (with transcription) zoahd (zohr), oBarao (bahr), zary (z o-r) and natag (nihadag). The translation results in the words sacrifice, lot, power, foundation [13], which appear to be semantically related based on Zoroastrian descent. The words are grouped around a small square image of a swirling star that could represent a sacrificial fire. App. B, however, contains a transcription of words from the beginning of the third paragraph of f1r. This example is included not only to show that the Pahlavi transcription also applies to the main text, but also to show the difficulty of translating the text, which was noted by all translators of the third paragraph of f1r."}, {"heading": "3.5 The colophon (f116v)", "text": "Further evidence for the proposed transcription is provided by the \"colophon\" (f116v).The last line of the short text contains the words arar dccy, which are clearly legible in contrast to the apparent Latin script on this page. We suggest the transcription xwar day, which would refer to the 11th day of the tenth month of the Zoroastrian calendar. [13] The question of whether the letter character located before the gap at the end of this line was originally the beginning of a year cannot be answered without further analysis of the velocity. Based on the Pahlavi hypothesis presented here, it seems possible to extract more information from the colophon. In App. C. we present an attempt to read the colophone, which is, however, largely speculative, even if we assume that the Pahlavi hypotheses are true."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "We have not been presented with more than a few words, mainly due to the inherent difficulties in reading Pahlavi. Therefore, it is not clear at this point whether the VM also contains words of another idiom, such as the northwestern Indian language of Gujarati, whose Parsi dialect contains many Iranian words due to Zoroastrian influence, although Gujarati does not identify itself as an Iranian language. It is noteworthy that the manuscript does not contain any obvious religious symbolism (apart from the crucifix on f79v, which may well be a later insertion), nor any other culturally identifiable elements. However, the astronomical diagrams of the VM are linked to the world of Zoroastrian culture in the Middle East or South Asia. They show no awareness of (formerly?) Arab astronomy, but seem to have the cosmological view of the VM in the Bundaheshesheshesheshesh. Finally, we want to stress that we have no evidence that the M may be produced in Persia (or even Black Sea)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The author acknowledges the use of the high resolution scans provided by Jason Davies' Voynich Voyager [6].

Note: The middle image shows Aries repeating f70v1, but the text also shows little evidence for interpretation as Capricorn. The first letters of the V constellation are ignored, making the transcription questionable. \u00ea The middle image shows Taurus repeating f71v, but the text also shows little evidence for interpretation as Aquarius. The first letters of the V month and V constellation are ignored, making the transcription questionable."}, {"heading": "B First folio text (f1r)", "text": "Passage from the beginning of the third paragraph of f1r. Not all translations from [13] are shown. Our transliteration shows several inconsistencies, which may be due to the complexity and development of the Pahlavi language and require further analysis. E.g. V otr retains P t, while V dody is used according to the transliteration d for P t [13]. Ending o, as in P for dody, is often ignored as an otiose line [13], see also the last character of Spandarmad. In VM, leading o otiosis is more common, e.g. in Spandarmad after the line break, while in V otr the leading o is considered part of the word."}, {"heading": "Notes", "text": "A hyphen stands for a line break. Small strokes, which occur in V either as c or \u0131, are here transcribed as h, i.e. as a sign for an extension of the next vowel. To explain the ignored V a in Spandarmad, the P d could be regarded as a contraction of V a and V. In the chapter on the constitution of plants (Bundahesh, Ch. XXVII) Spandarmad is mentioned [23]."}, {"heading": "C The colophon of the Voynich manuscript", "text": "C.1 IntroductionThe last page (f116v) of the Voynich manuscript (VM) can be regarded as a colophon, i.e. an addendum that often appears on the last page of medieval manuscripts and early modern prints, which normally contains information about the author, the production, the provenance, etc. According to the main text hypothesis that the VM is written in a Pahlavi-like script, we present a translation of most of the colophon text. We can identify a place of origin and a date, but not the year in which the manuscript was written. We also believe that we can identify the name of the writer, which could refer to a writer from a medieval Zoroastrian community that is possible in the city of Trebisonta, a gateway between Persia, Byzantium and early Renaissance Italy."}, {"heading": "C.2 Background", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "C.2.1 Pahlavi hypothesis", "text": "The claim that the VM is written in natural language is based on observations that most of the Voynich (V) characters have equivalents in the Middle Iranian Pahlavi script, which was used in medieval Zoroastrian scripts, commentaries, and a few other texts. [2] Some of the V characters are upside-down versions of their Pahlavi equivalents, which can be an effect of different writing styles. Other V characters are related in other obvious ways or can be explained as ligatures. Finally, two letters are added, but are easily identifiable from the vocabulary. In principle, therefore, it is possible to translate Voynich words using a Pahlavi dictionary such as Ref. [13] Although this process is successful in many cases, it is not always straightforward. Voynich handwriting colophon contains only a few Voynich letters."}, {"heading": "C.2.2 Colophon", "text": "A colophon in medieval European manuscripts usually begins with the explicit, which contains the Latin phrase \"explicit liver\" (the book is \"spread out,\" i.e. finished), although since early modern times the words \"colophon\" and \"explicit\" have been interchangeable. After the explicit, the colophon can provide information about the content, author, place, date, producer, client, publishing process, etc."}, {"heading": "C.3 First line", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "C.3.1 Explicit", "text": "We will try to identify a similar pahlavi expression at the beginning of the first line.With this bias, we propose to read the first word as \"ma-daya-n\" (book).The letters a in the manuscript are meant to indicate an extension of the vowel that is not written in Abiad alphabets.The first a touches the next letter and the second is corrected by an overlapping o.The i is meant to represent pahlavi Y.The word \"finished\" in Pahlavi is frazaftan (alternatively han-aftan), which we can read in the second word of the line.We must assume that the leading o is not a word delimiter, but stands as a waw for the f-tone (normally f is expressed in Pahlavi by p).Reading the second letter as r is consistent with all occurrences of that letter on this page. Another critical assumption is the interpretation of the sixth letter as \"two letters separated by each other.\""}, {"heading": "C.3.2 Trabzon", "text": "The present-day city of Trabzon, was the ancient city of Trapezos (T\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0435) on the south-east coast of the Black Sea. It had an important role as a trading gateway to Persia and was regularly approached by Venetian merchant ships during the 13th and 14th centuries. In Fig. 8 we note that the first two letters (with a + sign between them) appear as unsuccessful attempts to construct a ligature that does not exist in Pahlavi. The combination \u0161r does not come in the starting position [13], but it appears to be correctly placed between the other parts of the ligature [13], although it is usually used in the form of the vestibuff where it is predominantly used in the third parts."}, {"heading": "C.4 Second line", "text": "If we consider the beginning of the second line (figs. 9 and 10) as a direct continuation of the first line (see, however, fig. 7) and identify the first letter as an r (see figs. 9 and 10), which is also used to denote the number 20 [13], it may not seem easy to explain why the Pahlavi number is followed by a Roman IX (Pahlavi for the number 9 would be 333), but it is not entirely unexpected if one considers the organization of the Pahlavi numbers in steps of 20. Combined with the M in the preceding line, this results in a year 1029 that can refer (based on the date in fig. C. 5.1) to the Christian (11 November 1029), the Muslim (9 September 1620) or the Zoroastrian era (19 July, 18 August, or 26 December in 1660, resp."}, {"heading": "C.5 Third line", "text": "C.5.1 DateThe last line of the short text begins with the words aror dccy, see Fig. 11, which unlike most other Latin scripts on this page are clearly identifiable: the letters a, o, and r can express the same Latin phonemes. cc is a single letter that can refer to s or i, and the last character to the ambiguous letter d-g-y mentioned in the introduction; the remaining letter \u03c0 acts as d. the Pahlavi correspondence is nevertheless more complicated, but clearly suggests that the irregular transcription xwar, which refers to the eleventh day of the tenth month of the Zoroastrian calendar. [13, p. 142] After the mediocre attempts to indicate the date in the Latin script in the previous line seemed necessary, it is a return to the more familiar and less ambiguous letters Vasis."}, {"heading": "C.5.3 Finis", "text": "Since the smallest phrase of the colophon is particularly opaque, it is difficult to resist reading the last words of the colophon, fig. 13, as an English phrase So take me out of context. However, identifying the first letter as a descending s and the similar letter in the middle as an r within the Pahlavi hypothesis is not entirely contradictory, although we would expect the author to return to the voynich r rather in the case of ambiguity. A slightly more likely alternative reading can be found by re-writing the phrase in fig. 13 as a pahlavi in Latin letters. In this case, we would ignore the first part. If we read the first letter as b, then we can identify the first word as a volume referring to Bastan and occasionally being written as bn [13], pointing out that the letter waw (o) and the nun (n) as nothing."}, {"heading": "C.6 Drawings", "text": "The velum of the last page has a crack, which appears to have been mended before using the page. The scribe used the large part of the crack to the right of the crack for the text of the colophon and decorated the edge to the left of the crack with a few small drawings, see fig. 14. The upper image (fig. 14 left) bears a striking resemblance to a chicken corpse. The middle image represents a goat or a similar animal. The lower image is a female nude in the style of the figures on the \"naked sides\" (f75r - f84v). It would be strange to assume that it represents the creator. Although we cannot give an interpretation of the images here, we note the letters in the uppermost figure (fig. 14 left). Although the first letter is considered to resemble F, we should stick to the earlier reading of the letter as r, which is followed by one (or o) and n (fig. 8). The word ra means fight."}, {"heading": "C.8 Conclusion", "text": "All the results presented here of our interpretation of the colophon are more or less speculative, but at least we should admit that the combined evidence shows that the text on f116v does indeed constitute a colophon. Further analysis of the text and the material document could lead to more reliable information about the manuscript. Colophones already appear on clay tablets from the Ancient Near East, but in the case of the VM, the addition of a colophon appears to be an ineffective attempt to adopt a Western custom that may be considered suboptimal in its use, but we can now estimate it as potentially very useful."}], "references": [{"title": "Probing the statistical properties of unknown texts: Application to the Voynich manuscript", "author": ["D.R.

medieval Voynich Manuscript (VM) has resisted decryption and was considered a meaningless hoax or an unsolvable cipher. Here, we provide evidence that the VM is written in natural language by establishing a relation of the Voynich alphabet and the Iranian Pahlavi script. Many of the Voynich characters are upside-down versions of their Pahlavi counterparts, which may be an effect of different writing directions. Other Voynich letters can be explained as ligatures or departures from Pahlavi with the intent to cope with known problems due to the stupendous ambiguity of Pahlavi text. While a translation of the VM text is not attempted here, we can confirm the Voynich-Pahlavi relation at the character level by the transcription of many words from the VM illustrations and from parts of the main text. Many of the transcribed words can be identified as terms from Zoroastrian cosmology which is in line with the use of Pahlavi script in Zoroastrian communities from medieval times. 1 Why is Voynichese difficult? All writing systems in the world [8, 5] require some effort in acquisition and use. While for some groups of languages, difficulty and differences may be comparatively small [17], in others the complexity of the script can appear forbidding for all but a minority of scribes. Religious observance, for example, may require the adherents to continue using a script or language that no longer adapts to its language environment and that may thus tend to become ambiguous or incomprehensible. In order to retain a unique pronunciation and, supported by extensive commentaries, continuing understandability, glyphs (diacritics) from were added to letters to distinguish them, or additional letters (matres lectionis) were inserted to represent sounds (such as vowels in the consonant-based (abjad) scripts. However, such additional efforts may not be considered necessary, if the oral tradition in the community is sufficiently strong, such that the texts do not have to be extracted from the writing itself, but are rather remembered while being read. If the Voynich Manuscript (VM, MS 408 in the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University) derives from such a tradition, the difficulty in reading it may be understandable. 1 ar X iv :1 70 9. 01 63 4v 1 [ cs .C L ] 6 S ep 2 01 7 The Voynich Manuscript (VM, MS 408 in the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University) which is written on more than 200 vellum pages has been dated between 1404 and 1438 (University of Arizona, 2011), but its history is largely unknown until the discovery by the bookseller Voynich in 1912. Apart from a few cautious attempts, such as Ref. [3], so far little progress has been achieved in deciphering the VM nor even a decision was reached whether the VM has any meaningful content at all. Before we Our hypothesis that the VM is written in natural language, is to be evidenced by showing that the script used in the VM is directly related to Pahlavi, a writing system that was in use for several Iranian languages from before the current era at least until 900 [9]. Pahlavi is a particular case of a language that is notoriously difficult to read. It was used in medieval scriptures, commentaries, and a few other texts [2] related to Zoroastrianism, the pre-Islamic religion of Persia. Over the few centuries of the language evolution, many Pahlavi letters have coalesced, e.g. for the phonemes d, g, j, and y, only a single letters is retained in Pahlavi. Moreover, letters are usually joined in Pahlavi script and can appear thus similar to other letters: E.g., in addition to its proper meaning, a letter can be indistinguishable from as much a sixteen different phoneme or letter combinations [11]. In some words, corrupted forms of letters have become a standard that is accepted to various degrees by the scribes. In addition to Persian words, Pahlavi contains also a large number of heterograms, i.e. around a thousand, partially very common words of Aramaic origin that are meant to be read in Persian (like the Latin abbreviation i.e. is read in English as that is). Finally, as for many other ancient texts, material decay, language drift, scribe errors, unfamiliarity with the original cultural context, and, possibly, the need of the writers to hide the content from contemporary hostility, also contribute to the difficulty of reading the text. Concerning recent work on the VM, statistical approaches [1, 10, 14] that search for nonrandom features in data may be bound to fail if the target is quite random to begin with. The standard Voynich character set (EVA) [7] is not too helpful either, because it is unrelated to the phonemics, it breaks some of the letters into smaller parts, and fails to identify ligatures, all of which may further reduce the strength of the statistical analysis, cf. [19, 20, 18, 10]. In addition, the extensive 19th century literature dedicated to religious writing, see e.g. [15] was difficult to access until scanned copies became available online recently, and, finally, it may be construed that our academic habits thwart the systematic study of matters as obscure as the VM. The VM which is written on over 200 vellum pages has been dated between 1404 and 1438 (University of Arizona, 2011), but its history is largely unknown until the discovery by the bookseller Voynich in 1912. Apart from a few cautious attempts such as Ref. [3], so far no progress has been achieved in deciphering the VM nor even a decision was reached whether the VM has any meaningful content at all [18]. The present paper aims at providing evidence for the hypothesis that the VM is a readable text with an interest in itself. Our approach consists in establishing a relation between the Voynich and Pahlavi scripts (see Section 2). It will also become clear that only within a cooperation among experts in Pahlavi philology, Zoroastrianism, history of medicine, botany, astronomy and palaeography, the content of the VM can be revealed. We will provide evidence for the proposed relation between the two alphabets by a number", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
