CONTRIBUTIONS AND PAST WORKS", "text": "We look at the problem of efficient scheduling for multihop wireless networks, where the data packets have a deadline associated with their deliveries. As described in Fig. 1, the timely data throughput is \"highly sensitive\" to routing scheduling decisions, because the service is reduced from a single packet to 0 in a discontinuous manner as soon as its age exceeds its definition. The policy we provide is decentralized, and its scale of complexity is linear with the network size, i.e. the crucial problem of meeting end-to-end packet deadlines, which is typically encountered in multihop scheduling in wireless networks. We present the problem of looking for the timely implementation of maximizing policies as a Markov Decision Process (MDP IV)."}, {"heading": "III.

2017, "abstractText": "Consider a multihop wireless network serving multiple flows in which wireless link interference constraints are described by a link interference graph. For such a network, we design routing-scheduling policies that maximize the end-to-end timely throughput of the network. Timely throughput of a flow f is defined as the average rate at which packets of flow f reach their destination node df within their deadline. Our policy has several surprising characteristics. Firstly, we show that the optimal routing-scheduling decision for an individual packet that is present at a wireless node i \u2208 V is solely a function of its location, and \u201cage\u201d. Thus, a wireless node i does not require the knowledge of the \u201cglobal\u201d network state in order to maximize the timely throughput. We notice that in comparison, under the backpressure routing policy, a node i requires only the knowledge of its neighbours queue lengths in order to guarantee maximal stability, and hence is decentralized. The key difference arises due to the fact that in our set-up the packets loose their utility once their \u201cage\u201d has crossed their deadline, thus making the task of optimizing timely throughput much more challenging than that of ensuring network stability. Of course, due to this key difference, the decision process involved in maximizing the timely throughput is also much more complex than that involved in ensuring network-wide queue stabilization. In view of this, our results are somewhat surprising. Secondly, the complexity of algorithms that obtaining the policy scales linearly with the number of links present in the network. In case the network parameters are unknown, we derive iterative \u201conline learning\u201d algorithms that yield the optimal policy. We divide the available bandwidth into multiple sub-channels, and allow a policy to activate a set of non-interfering links on each of the subchannels. We consider several types of constraints on the bandwidth availability. When the wireless network is constrained by the average bandwidth utilization, then the obtained policy is shown to be optimal. In case the wireless network has to operate under a hard constraint on the available bandwidth, we truncate the policy obtained for the network with average bandwidth constraints in order that the bandwidth utilized by it is \u2264 K units in each time-slot. We show that this truncated policy is asymptotically optimal as the network traffic is scaled to \u221e.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
