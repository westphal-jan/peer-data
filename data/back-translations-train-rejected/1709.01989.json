Levels below that, in ascending order in terms of the use and usefulness of AI and data science, are defined as: descriptive analytics (\"what happened?\"), diagnostic analytics (\"why did it happen?\") and predictive analytics (\"what will happen?\").

Data is also the basis for the development of artificially intelligent software systems, not only to collect information, but also to: \u2022 learn, understand, and interpret information; \u2022 to behave adaptively; to plan; to draw conclusions; to solve problems; to think abstractly; to understand and interpret ideas and language."}, {"heading": "3.1 Machine learning", "text": "At the most general level, machine learning algorithms (ML) can be divided into two categories: supervised and unsupervised, depending on whether or not a target variable needs to be specified for each algorithm."}, {"heading": "Supervised learning algorithms", "text": "Apart from the input variables (predictors), monitored learning algorithms also require the known target values (labels) for a problem. In order to train an ML model for identifying traffic signs using cameras, images of traffic signs - preferably with a variety of configurations - are required as input variables.

Consequently, the calculation of KPIs for the purpose of evaluating and ranking suppliers is no problem at all nowadays. Data mining methods make it possible to use the available data, for example, to generate forecasts, to identify key supplier characteristics with the greatest possible impact on performance criteria or to predict delivery reliability. In terms of optimizing analytics, the specific parameters that an automobile manufacturer can influence to achieve optimal conditions are also important. Overall, the Finance Division is a very good field for optimizing analytics, as the available data contains information on the most important success factors of the company. Continuous monitoring 34 is worth a brief mention here, in terms of controlling. This monitoring is based on financial and controlling data, which is 34, is used in many ways and is actually very general."}, {"heading": "4.3 Logistics", "text": "In the field of logistics, a distinction can be made between procurement logistics, production logistics, distribution logistics and spare parts logistics. Procurement logistics takes into account the process chain that extends from the purchase of goods to the dispatch of the material to the receiving warehouse. When it comes to the purchase of goods, a large amount of historical price information is available for data mining purposes, which can be used to generate price forecasts and, in combination with supplier reliability data, to analyze supplier performance. As for suppliers, the optimization of suppliers can be used to identify and optimize the most important cost factors. A similar situation applies to production logistics, which deals with the planning, control and monitoring of internal transport, handling and warehouse processes. Depending on the granularity of the available data, it is possible to identify bottlenecks, optimize inventories and minimize the time needed, dealing with logistics, for example, logistics and monitoring."}, {"heading": "4.4 Production", "text": "Each step of the production process will benefit from the consistent use of data mining. Therefore, it is essential that all production parameters are continuously recorded and stored. As the main objective of optimization is usually to improve quality or reduce the occurrence of defects, further optimization areas are required and it must be possible to assign these data to the process parameters. This approach can be used to achieve significant improvements, especially with regard to new production processes. Other optimization areas include energy consumption and the throughput of a production process per unit. Optimization of analyses can be performed both in terms of quality and application."}, {"heading": "4.5 Marketing", "text": "The focus in marketing is on the end customer as he is in order to convince him.

By connecting to the Internet and using intelligent algorithms, a vehicle can respond to spoken commands and search for answers that can, for example, communicate directly with the navigation system and change the destination. Communication between vehicles makes it possible to collect and exchange information on road and traffic conditions that is much more precise and up-to-to-date than those that can be accessed via central systems. An example is the formation of black ice, which is often very local and temporary and can be easily identified and communicated in the form of a warning to other vehicles today."}, {"heading": "5 Vision", "text": "Vehicles are already being developed using \"modular systems,\" which allow components to be used across multiple model series, while at the same time shortening development cycles. However, the field of virtual vehicle development has not yet seen any effective attempts to use machine learning methods to extract knowledge based on other historical knowledge to support future development projects and make them more efficient. This issue is closely interwoven with data management, the complexity of data mining in simulation and data optimization, and the difficulty of defining an adequate representation of knowledge related to vehicle development is constrained by the organizational constraints of the vehicle development process."}, {"heading": "5.1 Vision \u2013 Vehicles as autonomous, adaptive, and", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to move around without being able to move, and that they will be able to move around."}, {"heading": "5.2 Vision \u2013 integrated factory optimization", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to survive on their own, without there being a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process, a process in which there is a process, a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process, a process in which there is a process in which there is a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process and a process and a process in which there is a process and a process in which there is a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process and a process, and a process in which there is a process, a process, a process, a process, and a process, and a process."}, {"heading": "5.3 Vision \u2013 companies acting autonomously", "text": "For example, when planning marketing activities or customer requirements, it is essential that companies of all kinds monitor their sales over time to predict how markets will develop and which customers will be lost intentionally in order to respond to financial crises, and to quickly interpret the potential impact of disasters or political structures. We are already doing this, and we are not interested in the individual's personal data, but in what can be derived from many individual components. Indeed, we can predict how certain financial indicators for markets will move and react, or how likely they are to find the right models of pre-production development and then derive marketing actions."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "Artificial intelligence has already found its way into our daily lives and is no longer just the subject of science fiction novels.
