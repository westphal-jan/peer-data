Ideally, the robot should be able to identify areas that are safe for navigation based on its own percepts about the environment while avoiding damage to itself. Bayesian optimisation (BO) has been successfully applied to the task of learning a model of terrain traversability while guiding the robot through more traversable areas. An issue, however, is that localisation uncertainty can end up guiding the robot to unsafe areas and distort the model being learnt. In this paper, we address this problem and present a novel method that allows BO to consider localisation uncertainty by applying a Gaussian process model for uncertain inputs as a prior. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and in experiments with a real robot navigating over rough terrain and compare it to standard BO methods which assume deterministic inputs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Sep 2017 10:17:52 GMT  (1323kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02169v1", "To appear in International Symposium of Robotics Research (ISRR) 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in International Symposium of Robotics Research (ISRR) 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["rafael oliveira", "lionel ott", "vitor guizilini", "fabio ramos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02169"}, "pdf": {"name": "1709.02169.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Bayesian Optimisation for Safe Navigation under Localisation Uncertainty", "authors": ["Rafael Oliveira", "Lionel Ott", "Vitor Guizilini", "Fabio Ramos"], "emails": ["rdos6788@uni.sydney.edu.au", "lionel.ott@sydney.edu.au", "vitor.guizilini@sydney.edu.au", "fabio.ramos@sydney.edu.au"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In all these areas, people will be able to be in a position to be in the position they are in."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where there is only one person who is able to establish himself in the region."}, {"heading": "3 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we review the concepts that form the basis of the method we propose.

In robotics, we can divide input noise into two categories: localization noise and execution noise. The first refers to noise that affects the robot's location estimation, usually due to imperfections in motion sensors and other types of sensors, such as GPS devices. The second type, execution noise, is the combined effect of anything that affects the execution of the robot path to a specific destination, such as localization noise, uncertain motion dynamics, etc.BO decides sequentially where the function being modeled, such as terrain roughness, is based on previous observations it has collected in previous steps.

The robot is equipped with an on-board computer equipped with ROS 1. The tests were carried out in an area where the terrain is covered with grass and where some parts of the robot are exposed to harder soil. The aim of the robot is to obtain a model of terrain roughness based on vibration measurements. As in simulations, the robot should be able to obtain a good model while avoiding rougher areas that cause high vibrations. In this scenario, excessive vibration can damage the robot or impair its ability to perceive the surroundings. Our robot was equipped with an IMU sensor placed on its chassis. With the robot moving, the vibration appears predominantly as a linear acceleration along the vertical axis of the robot by bouncing and bouncing the robot."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Performance", "text": "Figure 5 shows the GP model obtained by each BO method. We also collected a series of vibration measurements by manually driving the robot into the experimental area. To this validation set, a real-time kinematic GPS-2 device was used for high-precision location estimation, but these measurements were only used for validation purposes and not passed on to the BO methods, which relied solely on a traditional GPS device fused into an ECF to estimate the location, resulting in an uncertainty of slightly less than one meter. However, in both methods, the robot was placed at an initial position in the upper left corner of the search area, resulting in less model uncertainty in areas of lower vibration. As Figure 5a shows, UIBO is able to follow a path that propagates 2 https: / / emlid.com / reach / quickly through the search area, avoiding areas of high vibration, thus resulting in lower search area vibration than the search area, which is higher in the search area of the search area of the search area of the 5bration)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The proposed method offers a principled possibility to take this uncertainty into account in the inputs of a Gaussian process model used as a precursor to the BO algorithm. Execution noise is also taken into account by means of a query distribution in optimizing the BO capture function. It has been shown that the method outperforms other BO approaches in simulation and in an experiment with a physical robot. Therefore, the proposed method can be applied to problems where we are interested in mapping the transferability of a terrain but need to keep the robot safe in the midst of localization uncertainties. Some topics have not been addressed in this work, but are worthy of future research, one of which is the estimation of the execution noise that could be performed online by other statistical methods, for example by using the highest possible probability estimates for the parameters of a given distribution. Another topic is the extension of the DUCB method to include dynamic influencing factors that would consider both the way of exploring the environment as well as the implementation of many factors."}], "references": [{"title": "Theory of Reproducing Kernels", "author": ["N.

characteristics, some of which might significantly affect the integrity of the platform. Ideally, the robot should be able to identify areas that are safe for navigation based on its own percepts about the environment while avoiding damage to itself. Bayesian optimisation (BO) has been successfully applied to the task of learning a model of terrain traversability while guiding the robot through more traversable areas. An issue, however, is that localisation uncertainty can end up guiding the robot to unsafe areas and distort the model being learnt. In this paper, we address this problem and present a novel method that allows BO to consider localisation uncertainty by applying a Gaussian process model for uncertain inputs as a prior. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and in experiments with a real robot navigating over rough terrain and compare it to standard BO methods which assume deterministic inputs.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
