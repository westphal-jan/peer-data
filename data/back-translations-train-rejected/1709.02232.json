Introduction", "text": "Modern industrial control systems (ICS) deal with multivariate time series data of technological processes: sensors and control signals based on Australia 2001. Comprehensively a cyber component, ICSs are a target of cyber attacks (for example (Lee et al., 2014), which can modify sensor and control values or control logic parameters (target points). Such cyber attacks can be detected as anomalies in technological signals, which raises the problem of early anomaly detection. Various approaches have been proposed to detect anomalies in industrial data. Anomalies can occur for different reasons, besides cyber attacks: equipment malfunctions, human error, analog signal interruptions, etc. Here we offer only a brief overview of such approaches: RNNNBased on (Nuri et al., 2016), LSTM-based predictions (Filonov et al., 2016; Malhotra et al., 2015 and decode)."}, {"heading": "2. Dataset Description", "text": "The TEP model is shown in Figure 1. It was simulated in various normal modes and under cyber attacks. The generated dataset features are shown in Table 1.ar Xiv: 170 9.02 232v 1 [cs.C R] 7S ep2 017We created a training dataset with 201 single- and 336 transient-mode samples and a test dataset with 142 MEAS / MV / SP attack samples (TEP, 2017). Each sample is a multivariate time series of the dimension 59. In addition to samples for 7 single modes of TEP operation, we generated samples for 28 temporary modes over 4 variants of SP changes for each mode: reduction by 2% of the catalyst C-cleaning, change of the product mixture by 10%, reduction of the product rate by 15%, reduction of the reaction pressure by 1 \u2212 2%. Indicators of attacks in the test dataset are equal to 1.0 in the attacks of the corresponding MEAS or MB operations, the three types of attacks were not used."}, {"heading": "3. RNN-based Anomaly Detection", "text": "We use RNN-based prediction model. The detection of an anomaly is based on MSE (mean square error) between prediction and observation."}, {"heading": "3.1. Pre- and Post- Processing", "text": "The input data is normalized (the parameters are calculated on the basis of the training dataset).The error in the prediction square is summarized and smoothed with EMWA. The smoothing factor \u03b1 is calculated on the basis of the size of the input window w as \u03b1 = 1 \u2212 exp (\u2212 ln 2w).The minimum detection threshold is calculated as 0.999 quantile from the smoothed error in the training dataset."}, {"heading": "3.2. RNN Architecture and Training", "text": "To cope with the TEP dataset, we used the previously used LSTM architecture for the GHL dataset in a manner shown in Table 2.For both datasets, we use stacked RNN with 2 hidden layers of 64 cells each. The input window corresponds to the prediction window. ReLU as an activation function for hidden layers and linear activation function for the output layer are used. To train RNN, we use the MSE loss function and the RMSProp algorithm. Study step equal to 0.001. Number of epoch sequences 100. Average time of a training period is 70 seconds with batch size = 2048 and hardware Tesla P40, Intel Xeon CPU E5-2650 v4 2.20GHz. The resulting dependence on loss functions vs. epoch for training and validation of data sets is shown in Figure 2.Examples of trained NN predictions for normal behavior."}, {"heading": "3.3. Quality Metric", "text": "To compare the results of different anomaly detection approaches, we chose the NAB measurement variable, which is in the range s [\u2212 1.0, 1.0] (s = 1.0 if the detection is at the beginning of the anomaly window, s = 0.0 if the detection is at the end of the anomaly window, s (\u2212 1.0, 0.0) if the detection is not too far from the end of the anomaly window, s = \u2212 1.0 otherwise).Table 3 shows default profile weights (Lavin & Ahmad, 2015) for TP, TN, FP, FN for the NAB measurement. Experimenting with different types of attacks on the TEP, we observed that the anomaly window is not necessary, equal to the attack interval. Frequently, the consequence of an attack, which is also anomalous behavior, continues after the attack is stopped."}, {"heading": "3.4. Comparison with DPCA", "text": "In collaboration with the GHL dataset, we found that the most successful alternative to the LSTM-based approach is PCA. Here, we compare our RNN-based approach with Dynamic PCA (DPCA).DPCA parameters are: Time window size - 10; Room dimension - 590; Number of main components - 19 (Kaiser rule \u03bb > 1.0).With DPCA, we could only train separate models for each individual TEP operating mode.For the transient mode, we were faced with many false positive (FP) detections in DPCA. Therefore, we ignored these cases and calculated the values for DPCA as the mean of values for each individual mode (m): DPCA = 6 \u2211 m = 0DPCA (m) We tested RNN and DPCA on the TEP dataset using the NAB metric. Anomaly detection results are presented in Table 4.We combine the decrease of the NRA and DPCB detection in the Metric # 23."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusion", "text": "The RNN-based approach with GRU stateless cells and no dropouts is able to effectively handle stochasticity, stationarity, transient and anomalous behavior in a realistic TEP dataset. NAB metrics allow validation of the early detection model. A comparison with the DPCA shows that the RNN-based approach has better values for MEAS and SP attacks. Attacks on MV are detected with a certain delay, which we explain by the longer anomaly window of consequences of such attacks. We also found that the DPCA model can only be disclosed for a separate single mode and for a transient mode. TEP datasets generated with normal and anomalous behavior caused by cyber attacks are more convenient from a practical point of view to have a trained model for all types of plant modes, which we can only achieve with RNN-based approaches. The data sets generated by cyberattacks and the normal TEP are available to the public."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors are sincerely grateful to Konstantin Kiselev for implementing the TEP model for Python and to Artem Vorontsov for useful discussions, which were supported by Kaspersky Lab."}], "references": [{"title": "Fault detection and diagnosis in industrial systems", "author": ["L H Chiang", "E L Russell", "Braatz", "R D"], "venue": "Measurement Science and Technology,", "citeRegEx": "Chiang et al\\.,? \\Q2001\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chiang et al\\.", "year": 2001}, {"title": "A plant-wide industrial process control problem", "author": ["J Downs", "E.
