INTRODUCTIONThe use of machine learning (ML) is on the rise in many sectors of software development, and the development of automotive software is no different from each other. In particular, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are two areas in which ML plays a significant role [1], [2]. In automotive development, safety is an important goal, and the emergence of standards such as ISO 26262 [3] has helped to focus on industrial practices to address safety in a systematic and consistent manner. Unfortunately, ISO 262 was not developed to accommodate technologies such as ML, and this has a tension between the need for innovation and the need to improve safety."}, {"heading": "II. BACKGROUND", "text": "A. ISO 26262ISO 26262 is a standard that governs the functional safety of road vehicles. It recommends the use of a Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) method to identify hazardous events in the system and to set safety objectives that mitigate hazards. The standard consists of 10 parts, but we focus on Part 6: \"Software-level product development.\" The standard follows the well-known V model for engineering, which is shown in Fig. 1.An Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) refers to a risk classification scheme defined in ISO 26262 for an element (e.g. subsystem) in an automotive system. ASIL represents the degree of rigor required (e.g. testing techniques, required documentation types, etc.) to reduce the risk of the element, with ASIL D being the highest risk and ASIL A the lowest risk. When an element is assigned to QM (quality management) management, the AS9170 Xiv: 354.01 is then recommended."}, {"heading": "1a Static recovery mechanism + + + +", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1d Correcting codes for data + + + +", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "B.

Faults and failure modes", "text": "ISO 26262 prescribes the use of analyses such as the Fault Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) to determine how errors lead to errors that can cause damage (i.e., they are hazards).We may ask if there are types and failures that are typical only of ML and are not found in the programmed software. Specific error types and error modes have been catalogued for NNN (e.g. [13], [15]).Some of them are merely \"obvious\" ML-specific errors. For example, a neuron that randomly changes its connection in an operative NN is not really a neuron, but a conventional error that can occur in the software on which the NN is running. Others are clearly ML-specific, such as errors in network topology, learning algorithms or training sets. This creates the opportunity to develop focused tools and techniques to find the error independent of the domain for which the ML is being trained."}, {"heading": "C.
