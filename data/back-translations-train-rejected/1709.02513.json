In terms of electricity grids, all units ranging from generation to distribution have been installed with \"smart\" devices to make the grid \"smarter.\" By definition, a smart grid is a variety of operations and energy measures, including smart meters and energy-efficient resources. Smart Grid means not only hardware changes, but also algorithmic changes. Demand for electricity is so high that resources must be conserved carefully that no energy is wasted."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The majority of the literature that exists on the selection of sub-areas usually focuses on portfolio optimization and statistical techniques, drawing heavy inspiration from financial models and asset management, and the methodology we use using state-of-the-art AI techniques has not been tried to date. Some of the existing literature on the selection of sub-areas and economic shipping are discussed here. In (Chakraborty, Shukla, and Thorp 2011b) they have created a framework for efficiently managing the weather-related uncertainty risk of solar power generators while optimizing the economic return on solar power plants. They have used general optimization techniques. In (Chakraborty, Shukla, and Thorp 2015) they have proposed an innovative framework for analyzing the Xiv renewable energy portfolio: 170 9.02 513v 1 [cs.C E] 8S ep2 017able generators in a specific location and the construction of energy portfolios that minimize the overall performance and error prediction."}, {"heading": "Problem Description", "text": "Due to the weather-dependent nature of a number of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind, uncertainty in relevant weather variables leads to uncertainty in electricity production. In order to participate in electricity grids with a day-ahead obligation (Almeshaiei and Soltan 2011), electricity generators may need to guarantee reliability equivalent to conventional (fossil fuel-based) power generation such as thermal, which can mean 90% or higher probability that the energy supply obligation would be measured. Similarly, in remuneration programs, renewable power generators need to pay for the power imbalance between their agreed amount (typically in the day-ahead market) and actual performance at the time of operation."}, {"heading": "Dataset", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Software for Data Collection", "text": "For our simulation and testing purposes, we generated data using simulation tools such as Siemens PSS / E (Siemens, PTI 2011) and PowerWorld Simulator (PowerWorld Corporation 2005). We used the useful script system called psspy, which is built into PSS / E, which allows you to create grids and simulate situations with Python."}, {"heading": "Making the Grid", "text": "An important aspect of the experiments was how to deal with congestion, so it was important to design the grid manually so that congestion scenarios could be created more effectively. A well-connected grid normally compensates for the latent congestion in the grid, so a grid was created entirely by manually. The grid we used (power grid) consisted of 20 buses with 6 generators and 8 loads on different buses throughout the network, the basic frequency used was 50 Hz, which is the standard for India. The basic MVA for the grid was 100 MVA. Of the 6 generators, three were renewable (solar) and three of the generators were coal-based. There were two important interconnectors connecting the generator and the load caps. It was expected that the majority of the congestion would occur on these two large power lines, and three of the generators were coal-based."}, {"heading": "Solar Data", "text": "For this experiment, we needed solar data over several days and several points of time over each day. Some sources examined to obtain this data include, but are not limited to, Weather.com (Weather.com), AccuWeather (AccuWeather.com), and various sources cited in various research papers. Due to the lack of availability of freely available, well-formatted and / or desired data, the data used eventually came from the Department of Electrical Engineering of IIT Kharagpur. Scaling of the data was done accordingly to adapt it to the designed network. The general trend of the data was seen and analyzed using insights from (Sharma et al. 2011)."}, {"heading": "Congestion", "text": "Trying to operate a transmission system beyond its nominal capacity is likely to lead to wiring malfunctions and electrical fires; bottlenecks occur when transmission capacity is lacking to supply a waiting market. During bottlenecks, systems run at full capacity and adequate efficiency that cannot serve all waiting customers (Reymers 2008). In a competitive market, regulators are aware of the risk that utilities that control transmission services due to bottlenecks drive up prices, and most have safeguards in place to ensure that abusive pricing does not occur. The only way to reduce bottlenecks is to optimize the system to increase its capacity, add new transmission infrastructure or reduce electricity demand from end users."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "The reason for this is the fact that most of them are able to survive on their own, and that they are able to survive on their own if they are not able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "Predicting congestion in the grid", "text": "The input The data corresponding to a network of 20 different buses was collected, and various simulations were performed to obtain data that corresponded to both congestion and non-congestion. The data set included 715 observations, 650 of which were used for training and the others for testing, and the initial voltage value, which corresponded to each of the buses along with the actual power of the 3 solar generators, was fed into the model as input, and the model was designed to provide whether or not this initial state would lead to congestion."}, {"heading": "Classification using SVM", "text": "In machine learning, support vector machines (SVM) are a traditional form of supervised learning algorithm that learns to classify itself into two classes based on the previously seen examples (Cortes and Vapnik 1995). Of the 715 data examples available, 650 were used for training, while the rest were used for testing. Input to the SVM model was the voltage data of all buses and actual solar current data. The output of the SVM classifier was whether congestion occurs or not. Classification using deep neural networks A neural network with a hidden layer consisting of 100 neurons was constructed to complete the prediction task. The input layer was size 23 according to each bus voltage and solar current values, while the output was size 2 according to the probability that congestion would occur or not. To introduce non-linearity in the ReLU model, the activation of LU after the hidden layer (2010 and Nair) was used."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Using SVM, we found that the model reached an accuracy of 93-94% on the test dataset. Using neural networks, after training the model for about 500 steps, the final test accuracy on the test set was about 97-98%, showing an improvement of about 5% over the SVM model. This is expected because the neural network is able to capture hidden information about the congestion situation more effectively than a simple SVM classification. Training accuracy was shown in Figure 1 and testing accuracy was shown in Figure 2. Predictive congestion when the actual solar energy is not known. In the previous part, we assumed that we knew the actual solar energy from earlier times, but in reality we only know the power used by the solar generators, not the actual power generated. In fact, we only know that the predicted load state of the network and the engaged solar power from the generators was consumed."}, {"heading": "Objective", "text": "The task we are trying to solve in this part is to select the optimal subset of solar generators, which will minimize the total penalty incurred when using the solar generators. Given a past history of the load condition of a region and the solar power generated from the generators, the model should be able to analyze the data in such a way that, given the predicted load condition for the next day and the weather parameters for the day, the model will output the optimal subset of generators, which will minimize the resulting penalty. Penalty, which corresponds to a subset of generators, will be imposed two types of penalties by the grid. Penalty for the failure to generate power The first penalty that generator operators will have to accept for a renewable source of the generator is the penalty for the failure to produce the amount of electricity they had promised. Due to the uncertainty in the weather and thus the uncertainty in the power that is generated, the inability of generators to produce is often unable to generate the amount of electricity they had promised."}, {"heading": "The Model", "text": "For all 6 possible subgroups of generators, the L1 and L2 values have been calculated. Loss L1 is scaled accordingly, so that the L1 and L2 values are approximately on the same scale. Input to the model would be the voltage corresponding to each of the 20 buses before selecting the subset and the subset description. By subset description, we essentially mean information about which generators are selected among the 3 solar generators and the predicted solar power at the selected generators. Thus, it can be described by a vector of size 3 corresponding to the 3 solar generators, where one element of the vector will be zero if this generator is not selected. If this generator is selected, the vector corresponding to this index will contain the predicted power for this generator. Thus, the input to our model is a vector of size 23 (20 + 3)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "After training the model for approximately 2500 steps, the following results were obtained: \u2022 Training minimum L2 loss = 35 \u2022 Training minimum L1 loss = 6 \u2022 Test L2 loss = 59 \u2022 Test L1 loss = 8 These results are particularly encouraging because the low test losses show the ability of our model to select an optimal subset that causes the least penalty, i.e. the most economical choice with the lowest possible congestion probability. Diagrams for training and Test L2 loss were shown in Figures 5 and 6 respectively."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, we have created a network to select smart subsets by predicting bottlenecks and making an economic selection of subsets that have or do not have solar generators, all using machine learning and deep learning techniques; the operating system will be particularly useful in renewable power grids where generation periods are unpredictable (e.g. solar power generators only generate electricity during the day when the sun has risen); and with knowledge of the vulnerability of the grid, problems such as load shedding, power peaks, etc. can be efficiently managed; the results of our experiments have been very encouraging, and therefore further analysis can be carried out in different ways from where they begin; some of these paths are now being discussed; the emergence of renewable electricity, with its enormous potential and inherent regional and national character, provides an opportunity to examine the local structure of the grid and define coordination principles that will not only facilitate effective integration of renewable energy, but also increasingly simplify and codify the regional character of the grid."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The authors were students of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, West Bengal, India during the research phase for this project, which culminated in this work.
