However, mathematical proof gives a degree of confidence that is fundamentally different from empirical guarantees provided by testing. Extensive research efforts have yielded a number of effective verification techniques and they have seen successful applications in the real world. At the same time, however, it is also acknowledged that heterogeneous systems on a large scale are still beyond the scalability of most of these verification techniques. Noteworthy among these are Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which have not only discrete digital dynamics, but also continuous physical dynamics. Imagine a car today: it contains not only dozens of chips (such as ECUs), but also continuous dynamics of internal dynamics (etc.)."}, {"heading": "2 Backgrounds", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 STL and Robust Semantics", "text": "Here we present signal time logic (STL) [20] as our formalism for expressing (original, without causal information) specifications.

Furthermore, we assume that our algorithm proposed in paragraph 4 has the potential for many improvements.
