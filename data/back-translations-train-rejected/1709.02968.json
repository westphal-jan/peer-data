Theorem 1. Let M denote a binary relationship matrix, as we have explained above. A person Px and a person Py are related, if there is an n that Mx, y\u03c1 > 0. There are 360,000 individuals in the 2015 version of CBDB, and we should be able to identify clusters of individuals that represent families. Although Theorem 1 is applicable for this task, a more efficient method is to apply the ideas of identifying associated components in mathematical graphs. The basic idea is quite simple: individuals that belong to a family and members of different families cannot have relationships. Corollary 1 allows us to find the shortest relationships between two individuals."}, {"heading": "Building Family Networks", "text": "Similar quantification methods were used by Professor Michael Fuller when he designed a backend service for CBDB.
