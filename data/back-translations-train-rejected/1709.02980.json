Although existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of running deep neural network inference operations on mobile and embedded devices, they overlooked the reliability of mobile computing models. Reliability measurements such as predictive uncertainty estimations are key factors for improving the decision accuracy and user experience. In this work, we propose RDeepSense, the first deep learning model that provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimations for resource-constrained mobile and embedded devices. RDeepSense enables the predictive uncertainty by adopting a tunable proper scoring rule as the training criterion and dropout as the implicit Bayesian approximation, which theoretically proves its correctness.To reduce the computational complexity, RDeepSense employs efficient dropout and predictive distribution estimation instead of model ensemble or sampling-based method for inference operations. We evaluate RDeepSense with four mobile sensing applications using Intel Edison devices. Results show that RDeepSense can reduce around 90% of the energy consumption while producing superior uncertainty estimations and preserving at least the same model accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 Sep 2017 16:58:01 GMT  (2787kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02980v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NI", "authors": ["shuochao yao", "yiran zhao", "huajie shao", "aston zhang", "chao zhang", "shen li", "tarek abdelzaher"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02980"}, "pdf": {"name": "1709.02980.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "RDeepSense: Reliable Deep Mobile Computing Models with Uncertainty Estimations", "authors": ["SHUOCHAO YAO", "Urbana Champaign", "YIRAN ZHAO", "HUAJIE SHAO", "ASTON ZHANG", "CHAO ZHANG", "Shuochao Yao", "Yiran Zhao", "Huajie Shao"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "1 RDeepSense: Reliable Deep Mobile Computing Models with Uncertainty Estimulations SHUOCHAO YAO, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign YIRAN ZHAO, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign HUAJIE SHAO, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign ASTON ZHANG, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign CHAO ZHANG, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign SHEN LI, IBM Research TAREK ABDELZAHER, University of Illinois Urbana ChampaignRecent Advances in deep learning have led to unprecedented successes that could potentially bring higher intelligence to a wide range of mobile and ubiquitous applications.

Currently, RDeepSense can only support fully connected neural networks.

However, two dropout operations can be Vol. 1, No. 1, Article 1. Release Date: January 2016. Convolutionary neural networks and recursive neural networks in Bayesian neural networks [16, 18] but additional dropout operations are needed to theoretically prove that the extended two-step solution can be equated to any neural network with a statistical model."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "We introduced RDeepSense, a simple but effective solution that enables fully networked neural networks to generate well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates during model inference. RDeepSense is a computationally efficient algorithm that can deliver predictive uncertainty estimates with almost no additional effort in mobile and ubiquitous computing applications. Eoretical analysis also shows the equivalence between RDeepSense and a statistical model. We evaluated RDeepSense on four mobile and ubiquitous computing tasks where RDeepSense exceeded the most advanced baseline by showing small margins in the quality of uncertainty estimates while consuming the lowest amount of energy on embedded devices. In summary, RDeepSense is a simple, effective and efficient solution for mobile and ubiquitous applications to build reliable neural networks with uncertainty estimates."}], "references": [{"title": "Understanding dropout", "author": ["P.

deep learning have led various applications to unprecedented achievements, which could potentially bring higher intelligence to a broad spectrum of mobile and ubiquitous applications. Although existing studies have demonstrated the e\u0082ectiveness and feasibility of running deep neural network inference operations on mobile and embedded devices, they overlooked the reliability of mobile computing models. Reliability measurements such as predictive uncertainty estimations are key factors for improving the decision accuracy and user experience. In this work, we propose RDeepSense, the \u0080rst deep learning model that provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimations for resource-constrained mobile and embedded devices. RDeepSense enables the predictive uncertainty by adopting a tunable proper scoring rule as the training criterion and dropout as the implicit Bayesian approximation, which theoretically proves its correctness. To reduce the computational complexity, RDeepSense employs e\u0081cient dropout and predictive distribution estimation instead of model ensemble or sampling-based method for inference operations. We evaluate RDeepSense with four mobile sensing applications using Intel Edison devices. Results show that RDeepSense can reduce around 90% of the energy consumption while producing superior uncertainty estimations and preserving at least the same model accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
