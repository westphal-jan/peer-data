NTL may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed in emerging countries. Industrial NTL detection systems are still largely based on expert knowledge when deciding whether to carry out costly on-site inspections of customers. Electricity providers are reluctant to move to large-scale deployments of automated systems that learn NTL profiles from data due to the latter's propensity to suggest a large number of unnecessary inspections. In this paper, we propose a novel system that combines automated statistical decision making with expert knowledge. First, we propose a machine learning framework that classifies customers into NTL or non-NTL using a variety of features derived from the customers' consumption data. The methodology used is specifically tailored to the level of noise in the data. Second, in order to allow human experts to feed their knowledge in the decision loop, we propose a method for visualizing prediction results at various granularity levels in a spatial hologram. Our approach allows domain experts to put the classification results into the context of the data and to incorporate their knowledge for making the final decisions of which customers to inspect. This work has resulted in appreciable results on a real-world data set of 3.6M customers. Our system is being deployed in a commercial NTL detection software.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 Sep 2017 21:27:06 GMT  (1929kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03008v1", "Proceedings of the 17th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 17th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["patrick glauner", "niklas dahringer", "oleksandr puhachov", "jorge augusto meira", "petko valtchev", "radu state", "diogo duarte"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.03008"}, "pdf": {"name": "1709.03008.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Identifying Irregular Power Usage by Turning Predictions into Holographic Spatial Visualizations", "authors": ["Patrick Glauner", "Niklas Dahringer", "Oleksandr Puhachov", "Jorge Augusto Meira", "Petko Valtchev", "Radu State", "Diogo Duarte"], "emails": ["jorge.meira}@uni.lu", "valtchev.petko@uqam.ca", "diogo.duarte@choiceholding.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to be in a position, without being able to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position where they are."}, {"heading": "II.

In the subsequent learning phase, only the meaningful characteristics should be used. A common method for reducing dimensionality is the principal component analysis (PCA). However, time series, especially real data sets, are noisy, which can lead to poor performance of the PCA [23]. Therefore, when selecting the characteristics, we do not use PCA, but hypotheses tests on the characteristics in order to obtain the statistically relevant ones. These tests are based on the assumption that a characteristic xk is meaningful for predicting the binary label vector y when xk and y are not statistically independent [24]. For binary characteristics, we use Fisher's exact test [25]. For continuous characteristics, however, we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [26]."}, {"heading": "D. Classifiers", "text": "1) Decision tree: Decision tree learners such as ID3 or C4.5 [27] divide the input space recursively by selecting the remaining most discriminating feature of a data set. To predict, the learned tree is traversed from top to bottom. 2) Random forest: A random forest [28] is an ensemble estimator that includes a number of decision trees. Each tree is trained to control overpass based on a partial sample of the data and feature sets. In the prediction phase, a majority vote is made on the predictions of the individual trees. 3) Gradient-enhanced tree: A gradient-enhanced tree [29] is also an ensemble of decision trees. The ensemble is created by combining weak classifications (i.e. classifications that work little better than a random guess) into a strong tree. The ensemble is constructed by optimizing a maximum loss generator (SVM), a small class support machine (4)."}, {"heading": "IV.

The superiority of the AUC over other indicators such as accuracy, precision or callback in relation to the problem of NTL detection is documented in the literature [7]."}, {"heading": "B.

The number of characteristics before and after the selection is presented in Table II. Overall, 237 of the 304 characteristics are retained, most likely due to the too short time span they reflect. In fact, all characteristics of year differences and seasonal differences are retained. In addition, 34 of 36 characteristics of fixed intervals are retained. In total, the 2 characteristics are not retained for K = 3, most likely due to the too short time span they reflect.

The test performance of the best model per experiment returned by selecting the model is presented in Table III. The best test AUC of 0.65977 is achieved for training the random forest classifier on the combination of the retained features GTS, AVG and DIF. Generally, the random forest classifier works best for each feature set. Overall, we report the results of 28 experiments in Table III, both for the complete sets of features and for the retained sets of features. In 16 experiments, the feature selection results in better results on the use of all features. Our observation can be explained by the \"no free lunch theorem,\" which states that no model is generally better than other [35]. However, our best result of 0.65977 is achieved for the retained sets of features. Generally, we find that a better test set for each of two or three features leads to a better AUF:"}, {"heading": "F. Discussion", "text": "Previous work using the widely used daily averages determined a baseline that achieved an AUC of just over 0.5 [7], [36], slightly above chance, for real NTL detection datasets using linear classifiers. First, we would like to emphasize that increasing the performance of machine learning models on noisy real datasets is much more difficult than doing so for academic datasets created and curated in controlled environments. Furthermore, a small increase in performance of a real model can result in a significant increase in a company's market value. Our framework outlined in this paper clearly exceeds the baselines established in literature. As a result, our models lead to better detection of NTL, increasing revenues and profits for power providers, and increasing stability and reliability in their critical infrastructure. Our NTL detection framework allows other power providers to apply our extensive selection techniques to their model selection and feature selection."}, {"heading": "V. HOLOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATION OF NTL", "text": "The NTL detection approach presented in Section III and evaluated in Section IV makes it possible to predict whether customers are causing NTL or not. It can then be used to trigger potential inspections of customers with irregular electricity consumption behavior. Technicians then carry out inspections that enable them to eliminate potential manipulation or disruption of the power distribution infrastructure. In addition, fraudulent customers can be charged for the additional electricity consumed. Generally, conducting inspections is costly as the physical presence of technicians is required. In order to increase both the ROI of the limited number of inspections and the reliability and stability of the power grid, electricity providers rely heavily on expertise in practice to make the decision whether or not to inspect a customer [7]."}, {"heading": "A.

Users can circumnavigate holograms and interact with them in the most natural way through glances, gestures or voices. Spatial sound enables the hearing of holograms, even when they stand behind the user, allowing the user to visualize their position and position of the spatial mapping in a virtual way."}, {"heading": "C. Results", "text": "This application is used by domain experts at electricity suppliers, who perceive that customers are classified as either regular (green) or irregular (red). Domain experts can walk around a spatial hologram and view the data from different directions. They can then also interact with the hologram in different ways, for example by zooming or rotating the hologram as shown in Figure 5.Domain experts can also learn more about a customer by tapping on it. The spatial hologram then also shows the customer's consumption profile over a selected period of time as the predicted 12 months. A customer with a predicted regular consumption profile is shown in Figure 6. The consumption of this customer has changed very little in the last 12 months. As a result, the machine learning system classifies this customer as non-NTL (green). A customer with an irregular consumption profile is shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "D. Discussion", "text": "Our holographic spatial visualization of customers and their neighborhoods has the benefit of increased productivity. It has already been shown that customers \"neighborhoods provide important information to decide whether a customer is causing an NTL or not [9], [10]. There are many interpretations of this fact. For example, fraudulent customers can share their knowledge with neighbors or there may be a correlation between power theft and the prosperity of a neighborhood. Our system allows to increase the ROI of inspections and increase the reliability and stability of the power grid by incorporating expert knowledge into the decision-making process. Additionally, domain experts can use their hands to rotate and manipulate objects rather than be distracted by changing the focus on the input devices such as keyboard or mouse."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this work, we have proposed a novel non-technical loss detection (NTL) system for a real data set of 3.6 million customers. In the first stage, a machine learning system learns to predict whether a customer is causing NTL or not. To do this, we have proposed to extract a number of domain-specific features from the loud consumption data. We have demonstrated the statistical relevance of these features via generic time series characteristics. As a result, our machine learning system enables us to recognize NTL better than previous work described in the literature. In the second stage, we put the predictive results into context by visualizing additional customer and neighborhood data in a spatial hologram using a Microsoft HoloLens. With this hologram, domain experts can then review and modify the proposals that customers have to inspect. As a result, they can make the final decisions that customers have to inspect in order to increase the ROI of the limited number of inspections."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We would like to thank Tamer Aidek and Yves Rangoni from CHOICE Technologies Holding SA for the many good ideas they have brought to our discussions, which were partly financed by the Luxembourg National Research Fund."}], "references": [{"title": "Non-technical losses in power system: A review", "author": ["A.

assets that face non-technical losses (NTL) such as electricity theft or faulty meters. NTL may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed in emerging countries. Industrial NTL detection systems are still largely based on expert knowledge when deciding whether to carry out costly on-site inspections of customers. Electricity providers are reluctant to move to large-scale deployments of automated systems that learn NTL profiles from data due to the latter\u2019s propensity to suggest a large number of unnecessary inspections. In this paper, we propose a novel system that combines automated statistical decision making with expert knowledge. First, we propose a machine learning framework that classifies customers into NTL or non-NTL using a variety of features derived from the customers\u2019 consumption data. The methodology used is specifically tailored to the level of noise in the data. Second, in order to allow human experts to feed their knowledge in the decision loop, we propose a method for visualizing prediction results at various granularity levels in a spatial hologram. Our approach allows domain experts to put the classification results into the context of the data and to incorporate their knowledge for making the final decisions of which customers to inspect. This work has resulted in appreciable results on a real-world data set of 3.6M customers. Our system is being deployed in a commercial NTL detection software.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
