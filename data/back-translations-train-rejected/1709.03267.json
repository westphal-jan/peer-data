[2] proposed a method for extracting relevant association rules from marked items. We extend the work of Garriga et al.

Our work closes the gap between these two approaches to extract relevant interval pattern rules."}, {"heading": "2 Closed interval patterns", "text": "Let F = {f1,., fn} be a fixed set of n features. We present a training example as a tuple of real values x = {x1,..., xn} where xi-p pattern (fi), with an associated class pattern. The tuple stores one value per characteristic of F. We consider two-class learning problems where the set of examples E is divided into positives (P) and negatives (N) so that E = P-P-N and P-N = common patterns can be transformed into two-class learning problems.An n-dimensional interval pattern is a tuple of intervals < [li, ui] > i-p- and negatives (N) where li, ui-P-X-X = frequency of learning problems can be transformed."}, {"heading": "3 Mining relevant interval-rules", "text": "\"The green for the green for the green\" The green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green for the green \"green for the green for the green\" for the green for the green for the green"}, {"heading": "4 Implementation and results", "text": "We have evaluated our algorithm using three UCI datasets (Haberman, Iris and Spine) [1]. The algorithm is implemented in C + +. The experiments are carried out on an Intel Core I5 with 8Go RAM running Linux system.For all experiments in this section, fpmax = 10% and eqmod = 10. Figure 1 illustrates the number of closed interval patterns in positive examples, the number of frequent and accurate rules and the number of relevant interval pattern rules. We see that the computing times (see Figure 2) correlate strongly with the number of patterns. Even with small data such as the Iris dataset, the number of patterns for low thresholds is high (about 3000), but the number of relevant patterns is significantly lower than the total number of closed rules. In addition, the number of patterns increases exponentially with the number of modalities."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "We have introduced a new algorithm for extracting relevant rules from a numerical dataset that offers a wider choice of potentially interesting rules for experts. The number of extracted patterns is high but more representative of the input dataset, whereas standard algorithms such as CN2 or Ripper a priori select a very limited set of rules based solely on coverage and accuracy criteria. Future work will focus on proposing additional selection criteria that allow the expert to express his preferred relevant rules."}], "references": [{"title": "UCI machine learning repository", "author": ["K.
