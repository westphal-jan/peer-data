Uncertainty is inherent in data from many different fields, including social networks and computer science. [1] The problem of pattern mining, or finding common patterns in data, has been extensively investigated in deterministic databases since its introduction by Aggrawal et al. [3] and in the area of insecure databases [4]. Insecure databases have brought more flexibility in data representation [5]. For example, the mass functions of evidence theory are comparable to expert opinion because they provide detailed answers to a number of answer elements. They also allow to model the degree of belief in a question. Therefore, databases that distort mass functions (commonly referred to as evidence databases) are considered a database for expert opinions and imperfect data. What classical approaches have in common is that they extract answers (as long as they are redacted)."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "The Evidence Theory or Dempster-Shafer Theory [11,12] proposes a robust formalism for modeling uncertainty. Evidence Theory is based on several bases, such as the Basic Belief Assignment (BBA).

It is the series of possible answers to an addressed problem and is composed of N exhaustive and exclusive hypotheses: B = {H1, H2, HN}.A BBA m is limited by: {A \u00b2 qm (A) = 1m (we).

Frequently, different measurement methods were used, making it impossible to compare the results and draw patterns [15]. In this section, we will examine the opinion of several experts on collected measurement data. To do this, we were asked to collect the data through a systematic pro-cess review of 20 data sources (essays) from reliable search engines (PubMed and ScienceDirect). Data is collected on 7 parameters relating to muscle morphology, mechanics and motion analysis. Four main questions were asked to experts on measurement techniques (Q1), experimental protocols (Q2), number of samples (Q3) and range of values (Q4). An expert opinion database of 20 contacted experts with different expertise (medical imaging, motion analysis). Five grades were possible."}], "references": [{"title": "Mining over a reliable evidential database: Application on amphiphilic chemical database", "author": ["A. Samet", "T.T.
