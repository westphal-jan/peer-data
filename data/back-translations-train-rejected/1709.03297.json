In recent decades, public transport demand has increased enormously and is expected to increase even further. An example of a public transport infrastructure that has to cope with growing demand is the Staten Island Ferry in New York City: it connects the two boroughs of Staten Island and Manhattan with a regular passenger service. Currently, the fleet consists of five boats carrying 109 journeys and 70,000 passengers on a typical weekday. During peak hours, it operates in a four-ship timetable, with 15 minutes between departures. Various developments on the north coast of Staten Island predict a significant increase in shipping traffic on the Staten Island Ferry. To meet the projected future demand, the New York Department of Transportation must develop effective strategies to enable improved passenger flows on board the ferries and in the terminals. These strategies include lower boarding and the reconstruction of St. George's terminals in both Manhattan and Whitehall."}, {"heading": "RELATED WORKS", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "FERRY TERMINAL OPERATION AND FACILITIES", "text": "Staten Island Ferry operates with a travel time of about 25 minutes along a route between Whitehall Terminal in downtown Manhattan, New York and St. George Terminal in Staten Island, New York. It carries daily passengers of about 70,400 and 45,290, respectively, on weekdays and weekends, in both terminals in 2015. There are three classes of ferries: Barberi class of about 5,200 passengers capacity, Molinari class of about 4,400 passengers capacity and Kennedy class of about 3,000 passengers capacity. The larger ferries are used at peak times. During the week PM service interval is increased from 30-minute service to 20-minute service and 15-minute service. Waiting areas have a capacity of 3,530 passengers for the St. George Ferry Terminal and 10,771 passengers for the Whitehall Ferry Terminal (31). Ferry ridership was increased in the summer months (Jun, July and August)."}, {"heading": "MODEL DESCRIPTION", "text": "The approach used in this work is characterized by the choice of a multi-scale representation of the environment to obtain the good computational properties of an agent-based model that incorporates a coarse-grained spatial representation and uses a networked CA model to simulate parts of the environment that require a higher degree of accuracy. Currently, the overall system is being implemented within the framework of MATSim1 and uses its model and its network representation of the environment for the part where pedestrian interactions are not significant enough to generate the need for microscopic simulation, and the CA model is then used to model the interior of the two ferry terminals, where the particular location of the scene influences pedestrian space use and their travel times. A technical explanation of the CA model can be found in (29)."}, {"heading": "Microscopic Model", "text": "The model is a 2-dimensional cellular automaton with a square cell grid representation of the room. The 0.4 x 0.4 m2 size of the cells describes the average room occupancy of a person (34) and reproduces a maximum pedestrian density of 6.25 people / m2, which covers the values usually1www.matsim.org gobservable in the real world. An environment cell can basically be of type walkable or of type obstacle, which means that it will never be occupied by pedestrians during the simulation. By means of three simple mechanisms, the model is able to reproduce validated pedestrian flows in the case of 1-directional and 2-directional flows (see (29). Intermediate targets can also be introduced in the environment to highlight the extremes of a particular region (e.g. spaces or corridors), and thus become decision points for the route choice of the actors. Final targets of the discrete environment are their open edges, i.e. the inputs of the space are not connected to the concept exponentially."}, {"heading": "Special targets", "text": "In order to illustrate the entry and exit procedures, but also in general the automatic doors or turnstiles, which specify additional times to be crossed by people, a special intermediate destination has been introduced in the microscopic model, which is called a delayed destination. When a pedestrian reaches a cell of this particular object, he queries the respective amount of time to wait before continuing. This amount can be either static to model the time that an automatic door must open, or generated according to a predefined distribution, which enables, for example, the modelling of the average times that commuters need to pass through turnstiles. This type of destination is also used to implement the ferry timetable and the management of the exit and boarding process. In this case, a timetable is linked to the destination, and it describes the time windows in which the modelled gate is open or closed. Thus, the waiting time for pedestrians is calculated according to the specified timetable, so that in the exit and boarding area they are moved to the next dynamic area, waiting in that they are in that particular time zone."}, {"heading": "Flow in bottlenecks", "text": "As already mentioned, the model has already been calibrated to produce quantitatively valid basic diagrams of 1-directional and 2-directional flows in corridor-like environments. For the sake of space, this validation is not discussed here and is used for a detailed analysis (29, 33). Nevertheless, the dynamics simulated in the application scenario are affected by many bottlenecks and therefore the pedestrian flow needs to be discussed in the presence of physical constraints. This is empirically analysed by testing a benchmark scenario consisting of a rectangular space divided by a wall in the middle of the Y axis, with a central opening configuring a bottleneck at width. A series of simulations is then configured by varying variables in the discrete range [0,4,5,2], achieving stable results between this scenario and the respective starting state."}, {"heading": "Mesoscopic Model", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of us are able to hide when we are unable to play by the rules.

Initially, all links are considered not to be overloaded, and they switch from this state to an overloaded state as soon as the observed travel time along the link is longer than the free travel time. Conversely, when the first pedestrian is able to travel freely along the link, a link in an overloaded state switches over to an unoverloaded state. Each pedestrian who leaves a particular link while in an overloaded state imposes external costs on others. The amount of external costs corresponds to the time the pedestrian leaves the overloaded link until the link with the unoverloaded state is switched."}, {"heading": "SCENARIO SETUP", "text": "The Staten Island Ferry scenario has been modeled as shown in Fig. 2. \u2022 According to the subject of the analysis presented in this paper, only the floors used for the boarding process have been modeled. The two terminals are connected by a long connection (approximately 8 km) simulated with the queue model that implements the ferry ride, which takes 25 minutes. Configuration of the environment and population demand The microscopic environments that represent the terminals are shown in Fig. 4 and they have been modeled based on existing CAD drawings. Each building contains a waiting area that allows access to the boat, glides through multiple access points that have been modeled as a scheduled destination. Existing rules for terminal management stipulate that boarding and disembarking must be carried out successively so that no cross currents can occur in the vicinity. Furthermore, up to two gates can be opened for the boarding process at the same time."}, {"heading": "SIMULATION RUNS", "text": "The simulation runs examine the boarding operations of the two terminals St. George (SG) and Whitehall (WH). The iterative algorithm described above is used to achieve the Nash Equilibria of each demand scenario, which in this case represents an optimal distribution of the passenger flow between the available doors of the waiting areas and the boarding ramps connecting the terminals to the ferries. Per scenario, 30 iterations are performed, sufficient to reach a northeastern state. Analysis of the terminal operation focuses only on the travel times of commuters within the boarding areas, either from the time they cross the gates of the waiting areas, to the time they board the ferry - or from the time they leave the ferry until they cross the doors leading out of the boarding area."}, {"heading": "Observed Peak from Whitehall", "text": "The basic scenario aims to validate the simulation model so that it can be used to assess future forecasts. To this end, the time data of the boarding and disembarking processes were recorded with on-site observation during the late afternoon rush hour in Whitehall. Specifically, two complete processes were observed from the Whitehall terminal, where approximately 1,400 passengers boarded and 850 disembarked. Afterwards, the disembarking and boarding process was observed in Terminal St. George, where the 1,400 passengers disembarked and another 400 boarded. Simulated and observed results of this scenario are presented in Table 1. It turns out that there is not much difference between simulated and observed times. The less precise output of our simulation scenario is provided with the disembarkation process in St. George, but it is due to the fact that the observed disembarkation procedure was also performed on the ground floor of the terminal in the simulation system."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The paper presents the application of a multi-scale modeling approach based on microscopic and quantitatively valid cellular vending machines (CA) and a mesoscopic approach to the simulation of queues to simulate the St. George (on Staten Island) and Whitehall (in Manhattan) terminals of the Staten Island Ferry in New York City. Discussing the work involved and the application context, the model was presented, as well as the proposed developments to better meet this scenario. Finally, the results of the simulations conducted in the current and planned needs scenarios to validate the model and evaluate the appropriateness of the current layout and boarding process in order to meet the planned growth in demand. Results show that the authorities need to make some changes, either in the terminal layout or in the boarding process, to ensure an acceptable boarding time and the entire landing cycle. Future work aims to support these scenarios by assessing the choice of alternative licensing options."}], "references": [{"title": "Efficiently Using Micro-Simulation to Inform Facility Design \u2013 A Case Study in Managein Complexity", "author": ["E.
