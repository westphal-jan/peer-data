Treatment is considered stable if the patient has administered at least 10 AE drugs within a year without having had a seizure. Epileptic seizures were identified by hospitalization associated with an epileptic event, encoded with G40.x or G41.x with ICD-105. The total number of such patients is 8,379. Each patient's treatment path is the collection of time-stamped drug deliveries from 2009 to 2011. For each drug administration, event identification is a tuple < m, grp, g > where the ATC code of the active molecule, g, {0, 1} and grp is the pre-administration specialty group. The specialty group identifies the drug presentation (international non-proprietary name, per unit strength, per pack containing 1,786 units and per pack of data set of each)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are not able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

This new task seems useful for analyzing supply routes in the context of pharmacoepidemiological studies, and we are following the Polard et al. [12] study of epileptic patients with this new approach. On the one hand, extracted patterns are discriminatory, corresponding to supply sequences that are more closely related to a particular outcome, i.e. epileptic seizures in our case study. Such patterns are fewer in number and more interesting to physicians. 10On the other hand, the most important contribution of the DCM algorithm is the discovery of temporal information that discriminates care sequences. Even if a sequence of care events is non-discriminatory (e.g. drug change), the way they occur over time can testify to the outcome (e.g. seizure)."}], "references": [{"title": "Discovering metric temporal constraint networks on temporal databases", "author": ["M.R.
