The source of the data that is fed into such a system is one of the biggest challenges in this type of development that reaches from social media, smartphones and urban sensors. In this dissertation, we tackle the problem of researching social media data, as this type of data has lately been seen as a new opportunity and source for the extraction of valuable information to the city services and corresponding responsible entities. Social media data is largely represented by text messages, which are necessary to apply NLP methods to extract information from their contents. Such methods are usually complex 21frame work and consist of several different steps (e.g. related to the syntax of sentences, while others relate to the semantics of their contents) before achieving the desired results. Social media streams are no exception to the fact."}, {"heading": "3.2 Architecture Overview", "text": "The framework proposed in this dissertation is divided into four different modules: (1) collection and filtering; (2) pre-processing and analysis of text; (3) aggregation and (4) visualization of data.The current collection module is implemented to retrieve tweets from a specific bounding box, but if the user requests, multiple locations can be explored simultaneously.Other collection euristics are also available, such as keyword search and subsequent users. Depending on the target scenario to be examined and the analysis to be examined, these two heuristics must be added to the module. This detail has been taken into account during the implementation period and the flexibility that has been composited into the module. 22FrameworkFiltering tasks are directly related to sites heuristic of the collection module and the analytics to be examined. As this framework is designed to analyze cities or specific regions / zones of the module framework, if other search information from 23rd modules is required, then it will not be implemented."}, {"heading": "3.3 Data Collection", "text": "In Section 3.1, we explain the importance of the decision made to capture the heuristics of data collection 5,000 prior knowledge about these users within the 24PI box. Twitter allows the developer community two different tools to collect data, the Search and the Streaming Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The search API is based on Twitter's Representational State Transfer (REST) protocol and searches only for tweets posted in the last 7 days, while the streaming API creates basic endpoints (regardless of the RESTful endpoints) and retrieves up to 1% of Twitter's firehose. With respect to the proposed and developed framework, we chose the streaming API because of its free access to the community, smooth integration into the module implementation and due to the availability of real-time information. A positive point about the streaming API are the three available hayristics for data collection, so the retrieval tweets allow tweets to match with, for example, a text-specific question (the auto-tweet)."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Data Filtering", "text": "In the first attempts to study the collected data on the geographical distribution of the tweet, we discover that not all tweets contain a precise coordinate attached to them. However, there have been cases where tweets from other cities were collected by our crawler and this phenomenon should not happen if the capture method is based on geo-localized properties.

We enumerate and describe the various preprocessing methods implemented in this section: \u2022 Lowercasing: This operation is responsible for the conversion of uppercase to lower representations. The advantages provided by this operation are in the analogous analysis of words that we have written in different ways."}, {"heading": "3.5 Text Analytics", "text": "The extraction of information from texts may vary in several types depending on the task performed to accomplish it. In this dissertation, we have examined two different types of analysis of tweets: topic modeling and travel-related classification."}, {"heading": "3.5.1 Topic Modelling", "text": "To extract such information, we implement within our framework a generative module that uses theme modeling techniques.5https: / / pypi.python.org / pypi / pytz28FrameworkTopic modeling is a text-mining technique that aims to identify latent themes in a collection of documents.Over the past decade, the research community has used this technique in a wide range of work aimed at testing their applicability in different areas. Here, we also used theme modeling to characterize different cities and provide this type of information to end-users. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model proposed by D. Blei et al. [BNJ03] that allows the discovery of unknown groups and their similarities in a collection of text documents.The model attempts to identify which themes are present in a document so that a plate observes all 3.DA words."}, {"heading": "3.5.1.1 Features", "text": "Topic modeling, as in other learning models, requires a group of characteristics that need to be trained. In this case, we used the representation matrix - a representation in which each document is converted into a frequency vector according to the number of occurrences of each word in the message. The feature set was limited to a dictionary of 10,000 words and only took into account unigrams in the message content. The dictionary was also limited to words that occur in a maximum percentage of 40% of the entire data set, avoiding common words that were not removed because they were not included in the NLTK stop word list of the Python for the specific language in the analysis. The minimum occurrence value for a word that is taken into account was set to 10."}, {"heading": "3.5.1.2 LDA Model Resulting Topics", "text": "The final model used in the implementation of our framework is defined in such a way that it divides a tweet into 50 different topics.

Transportation companies can take advantage of this type of information, since human mobility can be studied as well as citizens \"opinions about transportation services. The Twitter Streaming API delivers an enormous amount of data, and filtering out the relevant ones in a short time is a tedious process. To succeed in this task, we have developed an automatic text classifier that can distinguish travel-related tweets from non-related ones. As there are no gold standard datasets in this area, a training and testing set of data had to be created to continue the experiment and evaluate the performance of the model produced. Conventional classification tasks in the field of intelligent transportation systems follow traditional approaches by constructing their set of features with standard bag-of-word techniques. In our experiment, we tried to combine a Bog-W with a first-in-line feature."}, {"heading": "3.5.2.1 Features", "text": "In this group of characteristics we consider only unigrams as the basis of the text representation used by Mikolov et al. [MCCD13] in the implementation of a powerful computational method called word2vec.

With this in mind, we decided to use MongoDB, a cross-platform document-oriented open source database, as data warehouse technology for our framework. MongoDB allows the storage of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) documents, which are the retrieved format of tweets through the Streaming API. Since in this dissertation we developed the framework as a prototype of a system capable of extracting information relating to smart cities and transport services, the large physical storage space for data was not a priority. In addition to the high performance, availability and scaling, MongoDB presents an internal framework that allows us to build the aggregation of data required by the thousands of users, in order to generate such large quantities of statistical specifications."}, {"heading": "3.7 Visualization", "text": "One of the most complex and time-consuming tasks in the development of this social-media framework is the selection of data visualizations to illustrate the results of the above modules. Visualizing information retrieved from social networks must be easily understandable, and the majority of systems examine important performance indicators, while others use more complex visual representations such as egocentric networks [STSO16]. Due to the amount of data processed, the generation of data visualizations by means of an atomic implementation is sometimes poor in terms of response time. Therefore, we had to take a different approach to solve this inefficient procedure. After a long period of research, we found a solution to this problem by creating a series of routines (Bash scripts) that are called periodically (hourly) to perform all kinds of necessary aggregations and update the corresponding data collections in the database."}, {"heading": "3.8 Summary", "text": "In this chapter, we will explain the implementation of our framework, the modules it consists of, and the methods and methods chosen for each module concept.During the design and implementation phase, we have tried to maintain modularity throughout the system to allow future extensions or even complementarity of existing modules.

If the situation requires, each module can be adapted to other systems.Finally, we will give an overview of the main features of our framework to end-users information that has been collected, filtered and analyzed in an almost real-time scenario. It is worth noting that due to the tedious tasks that each tweet goes through, it is impossible to provide immediate results as the system should be coherent and not treat each message separately.Information will be made available to end-users in short periods (e.g. 30 minutes), allowing all text modules to provide additional analysis module complementary information to this framework analyse.In this chapter, all additional analysis module tasks are actually available."}, {"heading": "4.1 Geographic Distributions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.2 Temporal Frequencies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.3 Content Composition . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.4 Summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 46", "text": "The main objective of this chapter is to develop relevant analyses taking into account the five different sets of data collected.

The volume of tweets posted per hour, per day, as well as activity by day of the week or hour of the day are statistics that allow the possibility of identifying patterns or variations that can be correlated with some events or incidents that happen in a city. During and after notable events, citizens are encouraged to share their feelings, opinions or even reports on their security and well-being (e.g. in cases of terrorist attacks) through mobile applications. This share of information increases the activity of social media platforms that can potentially be used to identify unusual events. Figure 4.4 illustrates the daily distribution of all cities for the period of recording, three whole months, between 12 March and 12 June 2017.

If there is a time pattern associated with a user's post of tweets, for example, the user posts a tweet in a period of 5 minutes throughout the day, then that user is a potential bot. The existence of bots is not taken into account in this dissertation because the information provided by such an automatic system can also be valuable.

Our data sets represent only three months of data, as supportive as the analysis may be, we conclude that the majority (> 70%) of tweets are marked with differently sized bouncing boxes instead of precise geo-coordinates.

Transportation and travel are marginal topics with a relative frequency of less than 2% in Rio de Janeiro and 2.3% in S\u00e3o Paulo. This experiment demonstrates the ability of our framework to handle different topic modeling analyses under unregulated and unconventional data, as found in most social media. Applying topic modeling techniques to tweets from two different cities allows interesting comparisons between them, as the entire analysis process takes into account what residents are talking about in their social networks.

Conventional approaches would require us to classify travel-related keywords in order to classify such tweets. On the contrary, our approach has been to develop a classification model to automatically identify travel-related tweets from unrelated ones.A major challenge that is always present in text analysis is particularly the case in Twitter messages.

Interestingly, the BoW functions have an impact on the precision cards obtained from our results, producing more conservative rating models. In terms of the results of the recall, we can see that the Logistic Regression, which uses only pocket embedding features, was the model with the best results; perhaps, when precision is taken into account, the same conclusions provided in Table 5.4, the best model under the F1 score was the Linear SVM, with a score of 0.85.

Terms such as \"walk\" can be used to describe the action of walking or, for example, the action of walking. On the other hand, the term \"train\" can be used to describe the means of transport train or some type of behavior through practice and instruction. The polysemy level of such terms has been taken into account while the construction process of our training set of tweets has been taken into account for the travel-related English classification model. In the first stage of the construction process, we used the same strategy of Portuguese training.

On the other hand, the near-perfect results led to doubts about the existence of over-embeddings, and so a leave-one-groupout strategy was applied to test the robustness of features. There, we excluded one of the travel mode classes, which resulted in models using word embeddings not being able to maintain the previously demonstrated performance.

Many research areas have tried to gain valuable insights from these large volumes of freely available user generated content. The research areas of intelligent transportation systems and smart cities are no exception. However, extracting meaningful and actionable knowledge from user generated content is a complex endeavor. First, each social media service has its own data collection specificities and constraints, second the volume of messages/posts produced can be overwhelming for automatic processing and mining, and last but not the least, social media texts are usually short, informal, with a lot of abbreviations, jargon, slang and idioms. In this thesis, we try to tackle some of the aforementioned challenges with the goal of extracting knowledge from social media streams that might be useful in the context of intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. We designed and developed a framework for collection, processing and mining of geo-located Tweets. More specifically, it provides functionalities for parallel collection of geo-located tweets from multiple pre-defined bounding boxes (cities or regions), including filtering of non complying tweets, text pre-processing for Portuguese and English language, topic modeling, and transportation-specific text classifiers, as well as, aggregation and data visualization. We performed an extensive exploratory data analysis of geo-located tweets in 5 different cities: Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, New York City, London and Melbourne, comprising a total of more than 43 millions tweets in a period of 3 months. Furthermore, we performed a large scale topic modelling comparison between Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. As far as we know this is the largest scale content analysis of geo-located tweets from Brazil. Interestingly, most of the topics are shared between both cities which despite being in the same country are considered very different regarding population, economy and lifestyle. We take advantage of recent developments in word embeddings and train such representations from the collections of geo-located tweets. We then use a combination of bag-of-embeddings and traditional bag-of-words to train travel-related classifiers in both Portuguese and English to filter travel-related content from non-related. We created specific gold-standard data to perform empirical evaluation of the resulting classifiers. Results are in line with research work in other application areas by showing the robustness of using word embeddings to learn word similarities that bag-of-words is not able to capture. The source code and resources developed in this dissertation will be publicly available to foster further developments by the research community in smart cities and intelligent transportation systems.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
