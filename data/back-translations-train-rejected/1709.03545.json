However, identifying such structures is crucial to understand how a social network is shaping, or to make predictions about future network behavior. To this end, a large number of diagram analysis methods have been proposed to analyze the topology of the target network at the node (Muppidi and Koraganji 2016), community (Fortunato 2010), Mart\u00ed \u0301 nez, Berzal, and Cubero 2016), and global levels (Wu et al. 2017), and perform certain tasks.Unfortunately, each level of analysis is strongly influenced by network topology, and so far no algorithms can be effectively adapted to work for arbitrary network structures."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "This year, we are not dealing with such a case, but with such a case, in which such a case occurs."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The development of deep learning and the growing maturity of graph topology analysis have led to more attention being paid to the ability to use the former for the latter (Li et al. 2015), and a number of supervised and semi-supervised learning methods have been developed for graph analysis, with a particular focus on the use of CNNs (Bruna et al. 2014; Henaff, Bruna, and LeCun 2015; Duvenaud et al. 2015; Defferrard, Bresson, and Vandergheynst 2016), which have shown promising results compared to traditional graph analysis methods (such as kernel-based methods, graph-based regulation techniques, etc.).

By using a GAN for each hierarchical level of the graph, we can reconstruct input diagrams very well, preserving both local and global topological features. In addition, our method is able to automatically determine the number of phases required to not parametrically reconstruct phases and the graph itself, which is potentially beneficial for understanding different phases of graph reconstruction. Our experimental results show promising results in terms of GTI's ability to learn different topological features from different graphs. To our knowledge, there is no single graph model that can capture these different topological features."}], "references": [{"title": "and Albert", "author": ["Barab\u00e1si", "A.-L."], "venue": "R.", "citeRegEx": "Barab\u00e1si and Albert 1999", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 1999}, {"title": "V", "author": ["Blondel"], "venue": "D.; Gajardo, A.; Heymans, M.; Senellart, P.; and Van Dooren, P.", "citeRegEx": "Blondel et al. 2004", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2004}, {"title": "V", "author": ["Blondel"], "venue": "D.; Guillaume, J.-L.; Lambiotte, R.; and Lefebvre, E.", "citeRegEx": "Blondel et al. 2008", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2008}, {"title": "Spectral networks and locally connected networks on graphs", "author": ["Bruna"], "venue": "In International Conference on Learn-", "citeRegEx": "Bruna,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bruna", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Infogan: interpretable representation learning by information maximizing generative adversarial nets", "author": ["Chen"], "venue": "In Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)", "citeRegEx": "Chen,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chen", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Convolutional neural networks on graphs with fast localized spectral filtering", "author": ["X.
