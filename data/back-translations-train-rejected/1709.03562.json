The high false arrhythmia alarm rate has severe implications such as disruption of patient care, caregiver alarm fatigue, and desensitization from clinical staff to real life-threatening alarms. A method to reduce the false alarm rate would therefore greatly benefit patients as well as nurses in their ability to provide care. We here develop and describe a robust false arrhythmia alarm reduction system for use in the ICU. Building off of work previously described in the literature, we make use of signal processing and machine learning techniques to identify true and false alarms for five arrhythmia types. This baseline algorithm alone is able to perform remarkably well, with a sensitivity of 0.908, a specificity of 0.838, and a PhysioNet/CinC challenge score of 0.756. We additionally explore dynamic time warping techniques on both the entire alarm signal as well as on a beat-by-beat basis in an effort to improve performance of ventricular tachycardia, which has in the literature been one of the hardest arrhythmias to classify. Such an algorithm with strong performance and efficiency could potentially be translated for use in the ICU to promote overall patient care and recovery.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 19:57:12 GMT  (174kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03562v1", "10 pages, 5 tables, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 5 tables, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andrea s li", "alistair e w johnson", "roger g mark"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.03562"}, "pdf": {"name": "1709.03562.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "False arrhythmia alarm reduction in the intensive care unit", "authors": ["Andrea S.

Furthermore, the improved baseline algorithm was able to reduce the false alarm rate to 9.9% and at the same time introduce 3.6% false negatives. This algorithm was additionally evaluated for each arrhythmia type using various QRS detectors published in the literature. In Table 4, these results are compared with the results of the improved baseline algorithm and the results presented by Plesinger et al. [7], where n / a indicates that the value was not specified. Overall, the results of the improved baseline algorithm are quite comparable with the results of the valve algorithm presented by Plesinger et al. [7] for classifying bradycardia and ventricular keyboard valves, whereby the asymmetric breakdown of the valve cartilage task of the valves in the valves is valves."}, {"heading": "3.2 Dynamic time warping", "text": "So far this year, we've been able to put ourselves in the position we're in, \"he said."}, {"heading": "3.3 Feasibility for real-time algorithm", "text": "In terms of runtime, DTW 94 \"s baseline algorithm and beat-by-beat approach are probably the most practicable for a real-time challenge where decisions about true and false alarms need to be made quickly. In terms of adaptability and expandability, DTW 67\" s beat-by-beat approach with a ventricular beat bank suffers somewhat because the ventricular beats in the ventricular beat bank need to be manually identified and added to the bank. In addition, the ventricular beat-bank approach could suffer significantly as the number of different types and morphologies of ventricular beats increases while the number of beats in the ventricular beat bank remains constant. Semi-monitored parametric methods for identifying ventricular beats could alleviate this problem to some extent [6]. Thus, the improved baseline algorithm would perform best as a lead-in-time setting."}, {"heading": "4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We describe and implement a system to reduce the false alarm rate in the ICU by analyzing multimodal data using signal processing and machine learning methods.
