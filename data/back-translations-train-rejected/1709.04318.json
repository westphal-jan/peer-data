FNT resembles feedforward neural network, which creates a tree-like structure by using genetic programming. To improve accuracy, FNT parameters were optimized by using differential evolution algorithm. The performance of the FNT-based CI model was evaluated and compared with other CI techniques: multilayer perceptron, Gaussian process regression, and reduced error pruning tree. The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using die filling as a case study. The die filling experiments were performed using a model shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG). The feed powders were roll-compacted and milled into granules. The granules were then sieved into samples of various size classes. The mass of granules deposited into the die at different shoe speeds was measured. From these experiments, a dataset consisting true density, mean diameter (d50), granule size, and shoe speed as the inputs and the deposited mass as the output was generated. Cross-validation (CV) methods such as 10FCV and 5x2FCV were applied to develop and to validate the predictive models. It was found that the FNT-based CI model (for both CV methods) performed much better than other CI models. Additionally, it was observed that process variables such as the granule size and the shoe speed had a higher impact on the predictability than that of the powder property such as d50. Furthermore, validation of model prediction with experimental data showed that the die filling behavior of coarse granules could be better predicted than that of fine granules.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 08:50:24 GMT  (3187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04318v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["varun kumar ojha", "serena schiano", "chuan-yu wu", "v\\'aclav sn\\'a\\v{s}el", "ajith abraham"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.04318"}, "pdf": {"name": "1709.04318.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Predictive Modeling of Die Filling of the Pharmaceutical Granules Using the Flexible Neural Tree", "authors": ["Varun Kumar Ojha", "Serena Schiano", "Chuan-Yu Wu", "V\u00e1clav Sn\u00e1\u0161el", "Ajith Abraham"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this thesis, a computer-aided intelligence (CI) called Flexible Neural Tree (FNT) was developed to predict the filling performance of pharmaceutical granules and identify significant variables in the filling process.

Whereas in 5x2FCV, one model uses an equal proportionality of data samples for training and testing (smaller training samples than 10FCV, but larger test samples than 10FCV).

The significance of each characteristic corresponds to the true density, d50, grain size and shoe velocity. The characteristics true density and d50 represent the powder properties. While the grain size and shoe velocity represent the variables of the nozzle filling process, it can be observed that the selection rate and the predictability value of d50 (0.62069 and 0.58626) were higher than the selection rate and the predictability value of the true density (0.55173 and 0.54136). Therefore, the d50 as a powder property has a comparatively higher significance than the true density. Likewise, the process variable grain size was more influential than that of the shoe velocity. However, the difference in the significance level was marginal, but when all four input variables were compared, the process variables had a significantly higher selection rate and predictability rate on the powder properties."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Identification of the best set input features.", "text": "Table 7 shows interesting results, where it can also be stated that the predictability value of the subset A5 (process variable granulate size and shoe speed) and the subsets A1, A2, and A3 (with both process variables combined with one or two powder properties) was higher compared to the subsets A5 and A6 (subsets in which one of the process variables was not used for prediction).The subset analysis gave a clear picture. It is said that the predictability value of the subset A3 was highest, but the selection rate of the subset A1 was highest, suggesting that the evolutionary process often preferred the combination of whole characteristics, i.e. the subset A1. Among the subsets A1, A2, and A3, however, the selection rate of the subset A2 was higher, indicating that d50 had the ability to represent powder properties than the true density, but even here the difference was marginally higher (about four percent)."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Accuracy of Model Predictions", "text": "Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show the comparison between the experimental results of nozzle filling and the predicted results of Model No. 1 of the 10FCV method using FNT. This model was chosen because it has the highest value of R2, leading to a better match between experimental and predicted data. Specifically, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 present the mass collected after each experiment as a function of the shoe speed of the three different MCCs powders for six different grain size ranges. It shows that there is a decrease in the mass that is deposited into the nozzle cubes with increasing shoe speed for all materials and granule sizes studied. In addition, a general increase in deposited mass was found at consistent grain grain size. MCC DG tends to show higher mass deposits compared to MCC PH 102 and MCC PH 101 for all materials studied and for all different size ranges c, with the exception of the ulum range (250 micrometer)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "Two main methods were investigated, 10-fold cross-validation (CV) and 5x2-fold CV. Computer-assisted intelligence models (CI) were developed using FNT, multi-layer perceptron, reduced error interface tree and Gaussian process regression. It was observed that the flexible neural tree models performed better than other CI techniques. Furthermore, by examining the FNT models of each method, it was found that the 10-fold CV was a more efficient method with a higher correlation coefficient than the 5x2-fold CV. Experimental results were used as inputs and outputs of the FNT models. The constructed model efficiently predicted the deposited mass based on the knowledge gathered from the experimental data. Similarly, the feature analysis determined that the shoe velocity and pellet size were more important for controlling the deposited mass than the raw powder properties (which is considered easier for the filling density)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the IPROCOM Marie Curie Initial Training Network, which is funded by the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union."}], "references": [{"title": "Experimental and numerical study of die filling, powder transfer and die compaction", "author": ["O.

developed to predict die filling performance of pharmaceutical granules and to identify significant die filling process variables. FNT resembles feedforward neural network, which creates a tree-like structure by using genetic programming. To improve accuracy, FNT parameters were optimized by using differential evolution algorithm. The performance of the FNT-based CI model was evaluated and compared with other CI techniques: multilayer perceptron, Gaussian process regression, and reduced error pruning tree. The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using die filling as a case study. The die filling experiments were performed using a model shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG). The feed powders were roll-compacted and milled into granules. The granules were then sieved into samples of various size classes. The mass of granules deposited into the die at different shoe speeds was measured. From these experiments, a dataset consisting true density, mean diameter (d50), granule size, and shoe speed as the inputs and the deposited mass as the output was generated. Cross-validation (CV) methods such as 10FCV and 5x2FCV were applied to develop and to validate the predictive models. It was found that the FNT based CI model (in the cases of both CV methods) performed much better than other CI models. Additionally, it was observed that process variables such as the granule size and the shoe speed had a higher impact on \u2217Corresponding author Neural Comput & Applic (2016) DOI:10.1007/s00521-016-2545-8 1 ar X iv :1 70 9. 04 31 8v 1 [ cs .N E ] 1 6 M ay 2 01 7 the predictability than that of the powder property such as d50.
