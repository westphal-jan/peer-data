In this section, we give an overview of relevant work."}, {"heading": "2.1 Discovering Weather Patterns", "text": "In recent decades, there have been several studies that attempted to discover weather patterns through unattended hierarchical and iterative clustering [14], as part of synoptic climatology [29]. Many of these studies have attempted to create statistically robust representations based on the calculation of major components in what this body of literature denotes, S and T modes. S mode refers to the typical application of major component analysis (PCA) per weather sample, which is used for the reduction of features, while T mode refers to the application of PCA per netpoint. (In our review, in Section 4, we refer to the T mode also as PCAT to indicate cases where PCA is applied to the \"transposed\" form of data samples.) Indicative, Huth [13] summarizes and compares the correlation, sum-of squares, agglomerative hierarchical, PCA means, and hierarchical agglomerative agglomeratives."}, {"heading": "2.2 Autoencoders for Feature Reduction", "text": "An autoencoder [16, 2, 8] is an unattended, forward-facing neural network designed to approximate the identity function, i.e. one that attempts to learn a function h (x) = x (x) x, where x and x (each denote the input and output vectors). After training, applications typically ignore the output of autoencoders instead of using the activation values of the hidden layers. In the case of a simple, single-layer autoencoder, the hidden activations are equivalent to PCA [4]. In its simplest form, if there is a single hidden layer and the number of hidden units corresponds to the number of inputs, the autoencoder is too successful in replicating the input, resulting in revision. Various methods have been suggested to avoid overload, e.g. by having fewer hidden than input units."}, {"heading": "3 Methodology and Rationale", "text": "Our methodology comprises two main steps: (1) the derivation of weather patterns to be used to drive reference cloud dispersion patterns, and (2) the subsequent estimate of the release origin. An overview of our methodology is shown in Fig. 2."}, {"heading": "3.1 Weather Re-analysis Data and Features", "text": "To discover weather patterns, we use weather analysis data, which is network data derived from optimal combinations of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and observations, making it the best available description of past atmospheric conditions. Weather re-analysis data covers a sufficiently large period (40 years) and is of sufficient spatial (less than 1 hour) and temporal (up to 6 hours) resolution across the region of interest, i.e. the European continent. This data set is freely available as part of the ERA Interim Project [6] and is provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). For this study, we used interim global ERA data spanning 11 years (1986-1993 and 1996-1998) with a 6-hour resolution provided by NCAR in format 3."}, {"heading": "3.2 Dispersion and Inverse Models", "text": "Atmospheric dispersion models are calculation codes that simulate the processes of transport and diffusion of air pollutants, as well as other physical processes that occur during dispersion, such as deposition on the ground and transformations (chemical reactions, radioactive decay, etc.). Dispersion model calculations are based on meteorological data as calculated by the WRF, above. Dispersion models can work \"in advance\" (prognostically) if the pollutant emission types and associated emission quantities (known as time functions) are known. They can also be used in \"reverse\" calculations, where, in combination with available measured pollutant concentrations, unknown pollutant emission types and emission rates are estimated. There are several types of atmospheric dispersion models. In this work, which include dispersions in long spatial ranges that refer to complex topography and high meteorological variability, we call the atmospheric dispersion models."}, {"heading": "3.3 Weather Patterns and Cluster Descriptors for Plume Dispersion", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "3.4 Source Estimation", "text": "To estimate the origin of the release, we follow a two-step matching process. After an event has occurred, we first identify the weather pattern that best represents the current weather. Multiple similarity (or distance) metrics can be used for this calculation. If we treat this comparison as an additional k-mean assignment step, we select the cluster that minimizes the Euclidean distance between the observed weather vector w and the center of the cluster in question. Based on our choice of a representative weather pattern, we then consider the dispersions previously calculated for our group of fixed release origin candidates. The probability that a location is the source of the release can be calculated by comparing the release distributions of the cluster-based dispersions with hypothetical detection measurements. A hypothetical event is determined by a sequence of measurements at specific locations that we compare with the probability of the release origin."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation and Discussion", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "4.1 Origin Estimation as a Classification Task", "text": "In addition to this study, we experimented with deep Convolutionary Networks [16] that treated the estimate of release origin as a classification problem. As this was intended as a preliminary study, we used the data produced as an evaluation data set for the cluster-based approach. We increased our weather and dispersion samples tenfold, and the weather data was increased by introducing random noises for 20 nuclear facilities in Europe and for 3-day periods, resulting in a tenfold increase in weather and dispersion samples."}, {"heading": "5 Application Prototype", "text": "Application protocols are used by the Big Data Europe Integrator Platform (BDI), the user interface uses the visualization platform to visualize and explore linked data, and the application protocols are used by the users themselves, and the application protocols are used by the application protocols, and the application protocols are used by the application protocols."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we presented a novel cluster-based approach based on machine learning for rapid estimation of the origin of nuclear events. Our approach is inspired by image processing, deep learning and data mining, which extends useful techniques to weather and atmospheric dispersion data. Inspired by the need to develop ML-capable reusable data products to enable the creation of complex applications, we discussed the derivation of usable weather patterns by clustering. We used deep autoencoders to derive robust latent properties for the application of clusters. By thoroughly evaluating our application, we provide evidence of effectiveness and usefulness in the field of nuclear emergency response and in adjacent areas, using complex physical models and large geospatial data. Guidelines for future research and development may include the following: (1) evaluation of alternative classification approaches, learning the origins, similar to the formulations presented here, but also taking into account the zero algorithms (2), including the following:"}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was funded under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Funding Agreement 644564.
