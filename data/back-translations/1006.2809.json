INTRODUCTION", "text": "The goal of a character recognition system is to transform a text document typed on paper into a digital format that can be manipulated by word processor software [1]. The system is required to identify a given input data/character form by mapping it to a single character in a given character set [2]. This process can be quite involved since there are several valid forms that a character may take. This is largely due to the many fonts and styles (bold type, italic type, etc.\u2026) that can be used. The motivation behind developing character recognition systems is inspired by its wide range of applications including archiving documents, automatic reading of checks, and number plate reading [3]. The field of handwriting recognition can be split into two different approaches. The first of these, on-line, deals with the recognition of handwriting captured by a tablet or similar touch-sensitive device, and uses the digitized trace of the pen to recognize the symbol [4].\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nA.

The second approach concentrates on the recognition of handwriting in the form of an image, and is termed offline [5]. In this instance only the completed character or word is available."}, {"heading": "2. HANDWRITING RECOGNITION", "text": "optical character recognition, usually shortened to OCR, is the mechanical or electronic translation of images of handwritten, English, Arabic, or any other language has it owns characteristic in term of the latter shape, histogram, way of writing and number of letters, OCR mostly used AI tools to classify or give the dissuasion of translating the image characters into digital characters, two way are usually used for recognition, either through supervised or unsupervised system, the most well-known supervised methods is Neural Network , SVM, KNN, while Fuzzy logic is one of the unsupervised method. Supervised methods depend on train the system on a sample of data; in this case this operation would call training data, after the training has been done, the system will be ready to classify any object according the trained data. Data recognition in general fallow the below stages [6],[7],[8],[9],[10]: A. In the training level:\na. Segment character by hand to be ready for training b. Extract features c. Select features\n\u00a9 2010 JCSE\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/jcseuk/\nB. Testing and recognition\na. Input images include handwriting b. Test the system\nArabic handwriting is one of the most complex cases for recognition, unlike English writing; Arabic letters has many ways, no uppercase and lowercase, but the letter has three shapes, in the beginning of word, in middle, in the end. In additional there are much kind handwriting, an accurate feature should be extract and wide sample should be use for training to have an accurate result. Arabic handwriting recognition requires character segmentation as the position of each isolated character is unknown. Handwritten characters can be extracted from the rectangles and can be recognized by a character recognizer. Optical character recognition, usually abbreviated to OCR, is the mechanical or electronic translation of images of handwritten, typewritten or printed text (usually captured by a scanner) into machineeditable text. It is used to convert paper books and documents into electronic files, for instance, to computerize an old record-keeping system in an office, or to serve on a website such as Project Gutenberg. Arabic, one of the six official languages of the United Nations, is a Semitic language and the mother tongue of more than 300 million people. Written Arabic is standardized for most official communication in the Arab world. Its character set and similar sets are used by a much higher percentage of the world\u2019s population to write languages such as Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu. Recognition methods for current written Arabic can also be applied to ancient manuscripts [11]. Below are some notable features:\n1. The Arabic alphabet contains 28 letters. 2. Words are written from right to left, numerals are\nwritten from left to right. 3. Most letters change their shape depending on\nwhether they appear at the beginning, middle or end of a word, or on their own. 4. Letters that can be joined are always concatenated in both hand-written and printed Arabic. The only exceptions to this rule are crossword puzzles and diacritics in which the script is written vertically. There are two main steps which must be done in order to achieve any recognition [12]:"}, {"heading": "2.1 Pre-processing", "text": "This step should cover all those functions carried out prior to feature extraction to produce a cleaned up version of the original image so that it can be used directly and efficiently by the feature extraction components of the Optical Characters Recognition (OCR) system [14]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Features Extraction", "text": "Features should contain information required to distinguish between classes, be insensitive to irrelevant variability in the input, and also be limited in number to permit efficient computation of discriminate functions and to limit the amount of training data required. This step involves measuring the features of the input character which are related to classification step. After features extraction, the character will be represented by a set of extracted features [15].\nFig.1 The General Processing of Handwriting Recognition"}, {"heading": "3. PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "Unlike other languages, Arabic has unique features, while other language doesn\u2019t have, from this language these are seven or eight language such as ordo, jewie and Persian writing, Arabic has twenty eight letters, each of which can be linked in three different ways or separated depending on the case [16]. Therefore, each character can have up to four different forms depending on its position. Furthermore, Arabic characters have different heights, which hamper noise detection."}, {"heading": "4. METHODOLOGY", "text": "Machine Learning: This approach involves Machine Learning (ML) techniques, in which classification rules are automatically created, by using information from labeled (already-classified) texts. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Neural network is an artificial intelligence technique simulating the way that human brain learns to recognize various patterns. ANNs were introduced by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943. ANN is trainable algorithms that can \"learn\" to solve complex problems from training data that consist of a set of pairs\n\u00a9 2010 JCSE\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/jcseuk/\nof inputs and desired outputs (targets). ANN has been applied successfully in many fields including speech recognition, image processing, and adaptive control. They can be trained to perform a specific task such as prediction, and classification. ANN consists of interconnected processing elements called neurons that work together to produce an output. There are large classes of algorithms which are applicable to (ANN) classification. In general, a neural network is a certain complex function that may be decomposed into smaller parts (neurons, processing units), and represented graphically as a network of these neurons. Segmentation and recognition might be used ANN to extract and classify the character from the image. The input of the ANN might be Data that been classified and some time features while the expect out-come is a classified character. A part from the demo has been presented in the figure below.\nBelow are the steps of the system flow:\n1. In the first step we convert the selected part into RGB 2. Convert the RGB into binary image 3. Segments the non-black pixels 4. Extract the features 5. Input to the neural network 6. Recognition"}, {"heading": "5.
