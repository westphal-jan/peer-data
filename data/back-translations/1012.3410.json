Distance metrics and distances have now become an essential tool in many areas of mathematics and its applications including geometry, probability, statistics, coding/graph theory, data analysis, pattern recognition. For a comprehensive source on this subject see [4]. The notion of a fuzzy set was introduced by [8]. It is a class of objects with continuous values of membership and hence extends the classical definition of a set (to distinguish it from a fuzzy set we refer to it as a crisp set). Formally, a fuzzy set is a pair (E,m) where E is a set of objects and m is a membership function m : E \u2192 [0, 1]. Fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise, such as pattern recognition, decision theory. The concept of distance and similarity is important in the area of fuzzy logic and sets. We now review some common ways of defining distances on fuzzy sets (see [9] and references therein).\nClassical distances measure how far two points are in Euclidean space. For instance, the Minkowski distance between two points x and y in Rn is defined as\ndr(x, y) := ( n\u2211 i=1 |xi \u2212 yi|r )1/r , r \u2265 1.

Consider A,B two fuzzy subsets A, B \u2208 \u03a6(E) with membership functions mA,mB : E \u2192 [0, 1]. Then (1) can be extended to the following distance,\ndr(A,B) := (\u2211 x\u2208E |mA (x)\u2212mB(x)|r )1/r , r \u2265 1.\nBased on (1) letting r = 2 we have the Hausdorff distance between two nonempty compact crisp sets U , V \u2282 R,\nq (U, V ) := max { sup v\u2208V inf u\u2208U d2 (u, v) , sup u\u2208U inf v\u2208V d2 (u, v) } . (2)\nThis can be extended to fuzzy sets as follows: let A \u2208 \u03a6(E) be a fuzzy set and denote by A\u03b1 the \u03b1-level set of the fuzzy set A which is defined as A\u03b1 = {x \u2208 E | mA(x) \u2265 \u03b1}. Then for two fuzzy subsets A, B \u2208 \u03a6(E) the distance in (2) can be extended to the following distance between A and B,\nq(A,B) := \u222b 1 0 q(A\u03b1, B\u03b1)d\u03b1.\nAnother approach is based on set-theoretic distance functions. For a fuzzy set A \u2208 \u03a6(E) define the cardinality of A as |A| = \u2211 x\u2208EmA(x). Extend the intersection and union operations by defining the membership functions\nmA\u2229B(x) := min {mA(x),mB(x)}\nand\nmA\u222aB(x) := max {mA(x),mB(x)} .\nThen for fuzzy sets A, B \u2208 \u03a6(E) we may define the distance function\nS1(A,B) := 1\u2212 |A \u2229B| |A \u222aB| = 1\u2212 \u2211 x\u2208EmA\u2229B(x)\u2211 x\u2208EmA\u222aB(x) .\nAnother distance is based on four features of a fuzzy set. Let the domain of interest be R and consider a fuzzy set A in \u03a6(R). The power of A (which extends the notion of cardinality) is defined as\npower (A) := \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e mA(x)dx.\nLet S(x) = \u2212x lnx\u2212 (1\u2212 x) ln(1\u2212 x) then define the entropy of A as\nentropy (A) := \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e S(mA(x))dx.\nDefine the centroid as\nc(A) :=\n\u222b\u221e \u2212\u221e xmA(x)dx\npower (A)\nand the skewness as skew (A) := \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e (x\u2212 c(A))3mA(x)dx.\nLet v(A) = [power (A) , entropy (A) , c(A), skew(A)] then [2] defines the distance between two fuzzy setsA, B \u2208 \u03a6(R) as the Euclidean distance \u2016v(A)\u2212 v(B)\u2016.\nWe now proceed to discuss the notion of distances that are based on descriptive complexity of sets."}, {"heading": "2 Information based distances", "text": "A good distance is one which picks out only the \u2018true\u2019 dissimilarities and ignores factors that arise from irrelevant variables or due to unimportant random fluctuations that enter the measurements. In most applications the design of a good distance requires inside information about the domain, for instance, in the field of information retrieval [1] the distance between two documents is weighted largely by words that appear less frequently since the words which appear more frequently are less informative.\nTypically, different domains require the design of different distance functions which take such specific prior knowledge into account. It can therefore be an expensive process to acquire expertise in order to formulate a good distance. Recently, a new distance for sets was introduced [7] which is based on the concept of descriptional complexity (or discrete entropy). A description of an object in a finite set can be represented as a finite binary string which provides a unique index of the object in the set. The description complexity of the object is the minimal length of a string that describes the object. The distance of [7] is based on the idea that two sets should be considered similar if given the knowledge of one the additional complexity in describing an element of the other set is small (this is also referred to as the conditional combinatorial entropy, see [5, 6] and references therein). The advantage in this formulation of distance is its universality, i.e., it can be applied without any prior knowledge or assumption about the domain of interest, i.e., the elements that the sets contain. Such a distance can be viewed as an information-based distance since the conditional descriptional complexity is essentially the amount of information needed to describe an element in one set given that we know the other set (for more on the notion of combinatorial information and entropy see [5, 6]).\nIn the current paper we introduce a distance function between two general sets, i.e., sets that can be crisp or fuzzy. Following the information-based approach of [7] we resort to entropy as the main operator that gives the measure of dissimilarity between two sets. We use the membership of the symmetric difference of two sets as the probability of a Bernoulli random variable whose entropy is the expected description complexity of an element that belongs to only one of the two sets. Thus the distance function measures how many bits (on average) are needed to describe an element in the symmetric difference of the two sets. In other words, it is the amount of additional information needed to describe any one of the two sets given knowledge of the other.\nBeing a description-complexity based distance gives it certain characteristic properties. For instance, the distance between a crisp set A and its complement A is zero since there is no need for additional information in order to describe\none of these two sets when knowing the other. That is, knowledge of a set A automatically implies knowing the set A and vice versa. They are clearly not equal but our distance function cleverly renders them as the most similar that two sets can be (zero distance apart).\nThe next section formally introduces the distance and in Theorem 2 we prove its metric properties."}, {"heading": "3 Distance function", "text": "We write w.p. for \u201cwith probability\u201d. Let [N ] = {1, . . . , N} be a domain of interest. Let A \u2208 \u03a6([N ]) be a set with membership function mA : [N ]\u2192 [0, 1]. We use x to denote a value in [N ]. Given two fuzzy subsets A, B \u2208 \u03a6([N ]) with membership functions mA(x), mB(x), as mentioned in section 1 we denote by\nmA\u222aB(x) := max {mA(x),mB(x)}\nand\nmA\u2229B(x) := min {mA(x),mB(x)} . Define by A M B = (A \u22c3 B) \\ (A \u22c2 B) the symmetric difference between crisp sets A,B. For fuzzy sets A, B \u2208 \u03a6([N ]) define by\nmAMB(x) := mA\u222aB(x)\u2212mA\u2229B(x).\nDefine a sequence of Bernoulli random variables XA(x) for x \u2208 [N ] taking the value 1 w.p. mA(x) and the value 0 w.p. 1\u2212mA(x). Define by H(XA(x)) the entropy of XA(x),\nH(XA(x)) := \u2212mA(x) logmA(x)\u2212 (1\u2212mA(x)) log(1\u2212mA(x)).\nDefine the random variable\nXAMB(x) := { 1 w.p. mAMB(x) 0 w.p. 1\u2212mAMB(x).\nWe define a new distance between A, B \u2208 \u03a6([N ]) as\ndist(A,B) := 1\nN N\u2211 x=1 H(XAMB(x))\nRemark 1. This definition can easily be extended to the case of an infinite domain, for instance, a subset of the real line. In that case the distance can be defined as the expected value of EH(XAMB(\u03be)) where \u03be is a random variable with some probability distribution P (\u03be) with respect to which the expectation is computed.\nThe next theorem shows that the distance satisfies the metric properties.\nTheorem 2. The function dist(A,B) is a semi-metric on \u03a6([N ]), i.e., it is non-negative, symmetric, it equals zero if A = B and it satisfies the triangle inequality.\nRemark 3. Note that the function dist(A,B) may equal zero even when A 6= B. We now prove Theorem 2.\nProof. Since the entropy function is non-negative (see for instance, [3]) then for any two subsets A, B \u2208 \u03a6([N ]) we have dist(A,B) \u2265 0. It is easy to see that the symmetry property is satisfied since for every x \u2208 [N ] we have XAMB(x) = XBMA(x). For every subset A the value dist(A,A) = 0 sincemAMA(x) = 0 hence H(XAMA(x)) = 0 for all x.\nLet us now show that the triangle inequality holds. Let A, B, C be any three elements of \u03a6([N ]). Fix any point x \u2208 [N ] and without loss of generality suppose that mA(x) \u2264 mB(x) \u2264 mC(x). Denote by p = mB(x) \u2212 mA(x) and q = mC(x) \u2212 mB(x). Without loss of generality assume that p \u2264 q. Then we have mAMC(x) = p + q. Denote by H(p), H(q) and H(p + q) the entropies H(XAMB(x)), H(XBMC(x)) and H(XAMC(x)) respectively. We aim to show that H(p + q) \u2264 H(p) + H(q). This will imply that for every x \u2208 [N ], H(XAMC(x)) \u2264 H(XAMB(x)) +H(XBMC(x)) and hence it holds for the average 1 N \u2211 xH(XAMC(x)) \u2264 1 N \u2211 xH(XAMB(x)) + 1 N \u2211 xH(XBMC(x)).\nWe start by considering the straight line function ` : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] defined as:\n`(z) := H(q)\u2212H(p) q \u2212 p z +H(p)\u2212 H(q)\u2212H(p) q \u2212 p p\nwhich cuts through the points (z, `(z)) = (p,H(p)) and (z, `(z)) = (q,H(q)). For a function f let f \u2032 denote its derivative. We claim the following,\nClaim 1. H \u2032(z) \u2264 `\u2032(z) for all z \u2208 [q, 1]. Proof : The derivative of H(z) is H \u2032(z) = log ( 1\u2212z z ) . This is a decreasing function on [0, 1] hence it suffices to show that H \u2032(q) \u2264 `\u2032(z) for all z \u2208 [q, 1]. The derivative of `(z) is H(q)\u2212H(p)q\u2212p . So it suffices to show that\nlog ( 1\u2212 q q ) \u2264 H(q)\u2212H(p) q \u2212 p .\nThis is equivalent to (q \u2212 p) log (\n1\u2212 q q\n) \u2264 H(q)\u2212H(p). (3)\nThe left hand side of (3) can be reduced to,\nq log(1\u2212 q)\u2212 q log q \u2212 p log(1\u2212 q) + p log q. (4)\nAdding and subtracting the term (1\u2212 q) log(1\u2212 q) and using H(q) = \u2212q log q\u2212 (1\u2212 q) log(1\u2212 q) makes (4) be expressed as\nH(q) + p log q + (1\u2212 p) log(1\u2212 q). Substituting this for the left hand side of (3) and canceling H(q) on both sides gives the following inequality which we need to prove\np log q + (1\u2212 p) log(1\u2212 q) \u2264 p log p+ (1\u2212 p) log(1\u2212 p).\nIt suffices to show that,\np log\n( p\nq\n) + (1\u2212 p) log ( 1\u2212 p 1\u2212 q ) \u2265 0. (5)\nThat (5) holds follows from the information inequality (see Theorem 2.6.3 of [3]) which lower bounds the divergence D(P ||Q) \u2265 0 where P ,Q are two probability functions and D(P ||Q) = \u2211 x P (x) log P (x) Q(x) . Hence the claim is proved.\nNext we claim the following: Claim 2. H(p+ q) \u2264 `(p+ q). Proof : Consider the case that p \u2264 q \u2264 12 . Since q \u2264 1 2 then H\n\u2032(z) evaluated at z = q is non-negative. Hence both H(z) and `(z) are monotone increasing on q \u2264 z \u2264 12 and H(q) = `(q). By Claim 1, ` increases faster than H on [q, 1], in particular on the interval q \u2264 z \u2264 12 . Hence, for all z \u2208 [q, 1 2 ] we have H(z) \u2264 `(z). Now, if p + q \u2208 [q, 12 ] then it follows that H(p + q) \u2264 `(p + q). Otherwise it must hold that p+q \u2208 ( 12 , 1]. ButH is decreasing and ` is increasing over this interval. Hence we have `(z) > `( 12 ) \u2265 H( 1 2 ) > H(z) for z \u2208 ( 1 2 , 1], in particular for z = p+ q hence `(p+ q) \u2265 H(p+ q). This proves the claim. From Claim 2 it follows that\nH(p+ q) \u2264 H(q)\u2212H(p) q \u2212 p (p+ q) +H(p)\u2212 H(q)\u2212H(p) q \u2212 p p\n= H(p) + q H(q)\u2212H(p)\nq \u2212 p . (6)\nIt suffices to show that q H(q)\u2212H(p)\nq \u2212 p \u2264 H(q)\nor equivalently, H(q)\nq \u2264 H(p) p . (7)\nLetting f(z) = H(z)z and differentiating we obtain\nf \u2032(z) = log(1\u2212 z)\nz2\nwhich is non-positive for z \u2208 [0, 1]. Hence f is non-increasing over this interval. Since by assumption q \u2265 p then it follows that f(q) \u2264 f(p) and 7 holds. This completes the proof of the theorem."}, {"heading": "4 Simple Examples", "text": "Let us evaluate this distance for a few examples. Consider two sets A and its complement A. Their membership functions satisfy the relation:\nmA(x) = 1\u2212mA(x)\nhence the membership function for the symmetric difference is\nmAMA(x) = max {mA(x), (1\u2212mA(x))} \u2212min {mA(x), (1\u2212mA(x))} .\nNote that for any x \u2208 [N ] with a crisp membership value, i.e., mA(x) = 1, or mA(x) = 0, we have mAMA(x) = 1 and hence in this case H(XAMA(x)) = 0. This means that for a crisp set A (for all x \u2208 A, mA(x) \u2208 {0, 1}) our distance has the following property (we call this the complement-property):\ndist(A,A) = 0.\nFrom an information theoretic perspective, this property is expected since knowing a set A automatically means that we also know how to describe its complement. Hence there is no additional description necessary to describe A given A. This is what dist(A,A) = 0 means.\nLet us now consider some examples of pairs of fuzzy sets and their distances. Let N = 20 and the domain be [N ] = {1, 2, . . . , 20}. In the following examples we plot the membership functions of several fuzzy sets. Note, we connect the point values of the membership function by lines in order to make the plots clearer (remember that the actual membership functions are defined only on the discrete set [N ]).\nExample 4. Consider the fuzzy sets A,B,C and the complement Ac with membership functions as shown in Figure 1. Note, that A and its complement are crisp sets. The distance matrix D = [di,j ] is shown in (8); the rows and columns correspond to A, B, C and Ac so that for instance the element d2,3 = dist (B,C) = 0.709. As can be seen, C is a translated version of B and they are both the same distance from A. This is due to H(XAMB(x)) = H(XAMC(x+10)). B and C are farther apart than B and A. Since dist (A,Ac) = 0 then each one of B, C is of the same distance to A as to Ac.\nD =  0 0.354 0.354 0 0.354 0 0.709 0.354 0.354 0.709 0 0.354\n0 0.354 0.354 0  (8) Example 5.
