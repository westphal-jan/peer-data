The former adds the disjunction on both the temporal and non-temporal side of the language, the latter assuming a complete role with the non-temporal roles (which are fixed in time).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:46:39 GMT  (225kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5446v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["a artale", "e franconi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5446"}, "pdf": {"name": "1105.5446.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Alessandro Artale", "Enrico Franconi"], "emails": ["artale@irst.itc.it", "franconi@cs.man.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Artale & FranconiTernovskaia, E.
