Introduction\nThe representation of uncertainty and imprecision has received a considerable attention in the Artificial Intelligence community in an attempt to extend existing knowledge representation systems to deal with the imperfect nature of real world information (which is likely the rule rather than an exception). An impressive work has been carried out in the last decades, resulting in a number of concepts being investigated, a number of problems being identified and a number of solutions being developed (Bacchus, 1990; Dubois & Prade, 1996; Kruse, Schwecke, & Heinsohn, 1991; Pearl, 1988).\nFor most knowledge representation formalisms, First-Order Logic (FOL) has been the basis: its basic units \u2013individuals, their properties, and the relationship between them\u2013 naturally capture the way in which people encode their knowledge. Unfortunately, it is severely limited both (i) by its ability to represent our uncertainty about the world \u2013due to lack of knowledge about the real world a fact can only estimated to be true to e.g. a probability degree; and (ii) by its ability to represent inherently imprecise knowledge\u2013 indeed, there are concepts, like hot, for which no exact definition exists and, thus, a fact like \u201c35\u25e6 Celsius is hot\u201d, rather being true or false, has a truth-value in between true and false.\nIn the last decade a substantial amount of work has been carried out in the context of Description Logics (DLs).1 DLs are a logical reconstruction of the so-called frame-based knowledge representation languages, with the aim of providing a simple well-established Tarski-style declarative semantics to capture the meaning of the most popular features of structured representation of knowledge. A main point is that DLs are considered as to be\n1. Description Logics have also been referred to as Terminological Logics, Concept Logics, KL-ONE-like languages.

In particular, the use of DLs in the context of Multimedia Information Retrieval (MIR) points out the necessity of extending DLs with capabilities which allow the treatment of the inherent imprecision in multimedia object representation and retrieval (Meghini & Straccia, 1996; Meghini, Sebastiani, & Straccia, 1997, 1998). In fact, classical DLs are insufficient for describing real multimedia retrieval situations, as the retrieval is usually not only a yes-no question: (i) the representations of multimedia objects\u2019 content and queries which the system (and the logic) have access to are inherently imperfect; and (ii) the relevance of a multimedia object to a query can thus be established only up to a limited degree. Because of this, we need a logic in which, rather than deciding tout court whether a multimedia object satisfies a query or not, we are able to rank the retrieved objects according to how strongly the system believes in their relevance to a query.\nTo this end, we will extend DLs with fuzzy capabilities. The choice of fuzzy set theory as a way of endowing a DL with the capability to deal with imprecision is not uncommon (da Silva, Pereira, & Netto, 1994; Tresp & Molitor, 1998; Yen, 1991) and can be motivated\n\u2022 from a semantics point of view, as fuzzy logics capture the notion of imprecise concept, i.e. a concept for which a clear and precise definition is not possible. Fuzzy concepts play a key role in e.g. content descriptions of multimedia objects (most of human\u2019s concepts are imprecise). For instance, in the context of images, the (semantic) content of an image region r may be described by means of a fuzzy statement like \u201cr is about a Ferrari\u201d and establish that this sentence has truth-value 0.8, i.e. r is likely about a Ferrari;\n\u2022 from a proof theoretical point of view, as there exist well-known techniques for reasoning in fuzzy logics (Chen & Kundu, 1996; Lee, 1972; Xiachun, Yunfei, & Xuhua, 1995).\nIn the following we will present a quite general fuzzy DL, in the sense that it is based on the DL ALC, a significant and expressive representative of the various DLs. This allows us to adapt it easily to the different DLs presented in the literature. Another important point is that we will show that the additional expressive power has no impact from a computational complexity point of view. This is certainly important as the nice tradeoff between computational complexity and expressive power of DLs contributes to their popularity.\nNote that our fuzzy extension for the management of imprecise knowledge is complementary to other DL extensions for the management of uncertainty, e.g. probabilistic extension (Heinsohn, 1994; Ja\u0308ger, 1994; Koller, Levy, & Pfeffer, 1997; Sebastiani, 1994) with some exceptions like shown by Hollunder (1994) where a possibilistic DL has been considered. Even"}, {"heading": null, "text": "though these probabilistic extensions enlarge the applicability of DLs they do not address the issue of reasoning about individuals and imprecise concepts, as imprecise knowledge and uncertain knowledge are \u201corthogonal\u201d (Dubois & Prade, 1994). Moreover, reasoning in a probabilistic framework is generally a harder task, from a computational point of view, than the relative non probabilistic case and in most cases a complete axiomatization is missing (Halpern, 1990; Roth, 1996). As a consequence, the computational problems have to be addressed carefully (Koller et al., 1997).\nWe will proceed as follows. In the following section we first introduce ALC. In Section 3 we extend ALC to the fuzzy case and discuss some properties in Section 4, while in Section 5 we will present a constraint propagation calculus for reasoning in it. Section 6 concludes and presents some topics for further research.\n2. A Quick Look to ALC\nThe specific DL we will extend with fuzzy capabilities is ALC, a significant representative of DLs. At first, we will introduce classical ALC, while in Section 3 our fuzzy extension of ALC will be presented.\nWe assume three alphabets of symbols, called primitive concepts (denoted by A), primitive roles (denoted by R) and individuals (denoted by a and b).2\n2.1 Concept and Role\nConcepts are expressions that collect the properties, described by means of roles, of a set of individuals. From a FOL point of view, concepts can be seen as unary predicates, whereas roles are interpreted as binary predicates.\nA concept (denoted by C or D) of the language ALC is build out of primitive concepts according to the following syntax rules:\nC,D \u2212\u2192 \u22a4| (top concept) \u22a5 | (bottom concept) A| (primitive concept)\nC \u2293D| (concept conjunction) C \u2294D| (concept disjunction)\n\u00acC| (concept negation) \u2200R.C| (universal quantification) \u2203R.C (existential quantification).\n2.2 Interpretation\nDLs have a clean, model-theoretic semantics, based on the notion of interpretation. An interpretation I is a pair I = (\u2206I , \u00b7I) consisting of a non empty set \u2206I (called the domain) and of an interpretation function \u00b7I mapping different individuals into different elements of \u2206I (called unique name assumption), primitive concepts into subsets of \u2206I and primitive roles into subsets of \u2206I \u00d7 \u2206I . The interpretation of complex concepts is defined as usual:\n2. Through this work we assume that every metavariable has an optional subscript or superscript."}, {"heading": null, "text": "\u22a4I = \u2206I\n\u22a5I = \u2205\n(C \u2293D)I = CI \u2229DI\n(C \u2294D)I = CI \u222aDI\n(\u00acC)I = \u2206I \\ CI\n(\u2200R.C)I = {d \u2208 \u2206I : \u2200d\u2032.(d, d\u2032) 6\u2208 RI or d\u2032 \u2208 CI}\n(\u2203R.C)I = {d \u2208 \u2206I : \u2203d\u2032.(d, d\u2032) \u2208 RI and d\u2032 \u2208 CI}.\nNote that each concept C and role R can be mapped into an equivalent open first-order formula FC(x) and FR(x, y), respectively:\nF\u22a4(x) = T (1)\nF\u22a5(x) = F (2)\nFA(x) = A(x) (3)\nFR(x, y) = R(x, y) (4)\nFC\u2293D(x) = FC(x) \u2227 FD(x) (5)\nFC\u2294D(x) = FC(x) \u2228 FD(x) (6)\nF\u00acC(x) = \u00acFC(x) (7)\nF\u2200R.C(x) = \u2200y.\u00acFR(x, y) \u2228 FC(y) (8)\nF\u2203R.C(x) = \u2203y.FR(x, y) \u2227 FC(y), (9)\nwhere T and F are two formulae representing the truth-value \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d, respectively (e.g. T = p \u2228 \u00acp and F = p \u2227 \u00acp, for some letter p).\nTwo concepts C and D are said to be equivalent (denoted by C \u2261 D) when CI = DI\nfor all interpretations I. Note that, e.g. \u22a4 \u2261 \u00ac \u22a5; C \u2293D \u2261 \u00ac(\u00acC \u2294 \u00acD), and (\u2203R.C) \u2261 (\u00ac\u2200R.\u00acC).\n2.3 Assertion\nAn assertion (denoted by \u03b1) is an expression of type a:C (\u201ca is C\u201d, also \u201ca is an instance of C\u201d), or an expression of type (a, b):R (\u201c(a, b) is R\u201d, also \u201c(a, b) is an instance of R\u201d). For instance, tom:Tall \u2293 Student asserts that Tom is a tall student, whereas (tim, tom):Friend asserts that Tom is a friend of Tim. A primitive assertion is either an assertion of the form a:A, where A is a primitive concept, or an assertion of the form (a, b):R. From a semantics point of view, an interpretation I satisfies a:C (resp. (a, b):R) iff aI \u2208 CI (resp. (aI , bI) \u2208 RI).\n2.4 Terminological Axiom\nA terminological axiom (denoted by \u03c4) is either a concept specialisation or a concept definition. A concept specialisation is an expression of the form A<\u00b7C, where A is a primitive concept and C is a concept. A specialisation allows stating the existence of a specialisation (\u201cmore specific than\u201d) relation between concepts. For instance, Ferrari<\u00b7SportCar \u2293"}, {"heading": null, "text": "\u2203Ownedby.CarFanatic states that a Ferrari is a sport car that is owned by a car fanatic. On the other hand, a concept definition is an expression of the form A: = C, where A is a primitive concept and C is a concept. A concept definition allows stating the equivalence between concepts. For instance, Tennis: = SportKind \u2293 (\u2203HasSportTool.\u22a4) \u2293 (\u2200HasSportTool.TennisRacket) states that tennis is identified by a kind of sport having a tennis racket as a sport tool. From a semantics point of view, an interpretation I satisfies a concept specialisation A<\u00b7C iff AI \u2286 CI . Similarly, an interpretation I satisfies a concept definition A: = C iff AI = CI .\n2.5 Knowledge Base, Entailment and Subsumption\nA finite set K of assertions and terminological axioms will be called a Knowledge Base (KB). With KA we will denote the set of assertions in K, whereas with KT we will denote the set of terminological axioms in K, also called a terminology. A KB K is purely assertional if KT = \u2205. Further, we will assume that a terminology KT is such that no concept A appears more than once on the left hand side of a terminological axiom \u03c4 \u2208 KT and that no cyclic definitions are present in KT .\n3\nWe will say that an interpretation I satisfies (is a model of ) a KB K iff I satisfies each element in K. A KB K entails an assertion \u03b1 (denoted by K |= \u03b1) iff every model of K also satisfies \u03b1. Furthermore, let KT be a terminology and let C,D be two concepts. We will say that D subsumes C with respect to (w.r.t.) KT (denoted by C \u2291KT D) iff for every model I of KT , C\nI \u2286 DI holds.\nThe problem of determining whether K |= \u03b1 is called entailment problem; the problem of determining whether C \u2291KT D is called subsumption problem; and the problem of determining whether K is satisfiable is called satisfiability problem.\nIt is well known (Buchheit, Donini, & Schaerf, 1993a; Donini, Lenzerini, Nardi, & Schaerf, 1994; Nebel, 1990) that in ALC\nK |= (a, b):R iff (a, b):R \u2208 K (10)\nK |= a:C iff K \u222a {a:\u00acC} is not satisfiable (11)\nC \u2291\u2205 D iff a:C |= a:D, for a new a (12)\nC \u2291KT D iff C \u2032 \u2291\u2205 D\n\u2032 (13)\nwhere C \u2032 and D\u2032 are build from C and D by expanding the terminology KT to K \u2032\u2032 T and\nsubstituting every primitive concept occurring in C or D, which is defined in K \u2032\u2032T , with its defining term in K \u2032\u2032T . The expansion of a KB K works as follows (Nebel, 1990).\n1. Elimination of concept specialisation: each concept specialisation A<\u00b7C \u2208 KT is replaced with a concept definition A: = C \u2293 A\u2217, where A\u2217 is a new primitive concept. A\u2217 stands for the absent part of the definition of A. Let K \u2032T be the terminology, which is obtained by replacing all concept specialisation by concept definitions.\n3. We will say that A directly uses primitive concept B in KT , if there is \u03c4 \u2208 KT such that A is on the left hand side of \u03c4 and B occurs in the right hand side of \u03c4 . Let uses be the transitive closure of the relation directly uses in KT . KT is cyclic iff there is A such that A uses A in KT ."}, {"heading": null, "text": "2. Expansion of K \u2032T : every defined concept (i.e. the first argument of a concept definition) which occurs in the defining term of a concept definition (i.e. the second argument of a concept definition) is substituted by its defining term. This process is iterated until there remain only undefined concepts in the second arguments of concept definitions. This yields a terminology K \u2032\u2032T .\n3. Expansion of KA: every primitive concept occurring in KA which is defined in K \u2032\u2032 T is\nsubstituted by its defining term in K \u2032\u2032T . This yields K \u2032 A.\nThe transformation has the nice property that K |= \u03b1 iff K \u2032A |= \u03b1 \u2032, where \u03b1\u2032 is obtained by\nreplacing every primitive concept occurring in \u03b1, which is defined in K \u2032\u2032T , with its defining term in K \u2032\u2032T . While this allows us to restrict our attention to purely assertional KBs only, it is worth noting that the expansion process can be exponential (Nebel, 1988).\nFrom (10)\u2013(13), it follows that the above problems can be reduced to the satisfiability problem. There exists a well known technique based on constraint propagation solving this problem (Schmidt-Schau\u00df & Smolka, 1991; Buchheit, Donini, & Schaerf, 1993b; Donini et al., 1994).\nWe conclude with an example.\nExample 1 Consider the following terminology KT .\nSportKind <\u00b7 \u22a4 SportTool <\u00b7 \u22a4 IndividualSport <\u00b7 SportKind TeamSport <\u00b7 SportKind Basketball <\u00b7 SportTool TennisRacket <\u00b7 SportTool Basket : = SportKind\u2293\n(\u2203KindOfSport.\u22a4)\u2293 (\u2200KindOfSport.TeamSport)\u2293 (\u2203HasSportTool.\u22a4)\u2293 (\u2200HasSportTool.Basketball)\nTennis : = SportKind\u2293 (\u2203KindOfSport.\u22a4)\u2293 (\u2200KindOfSport.IndividualSport)\u2293 (\u2203HasSportTool.\u22a4)\u2293 (\u2200HasSportTool.TennisRacket)\nSuppose that there are two video sequences v1, v2, which are about basket and tennis, respectively. We may represent the semantic content of them through\nKv1 = {v1:Video \u2293 \u2203About.Basket} Kv2 = {v2:Video \u2293 \u2203About.Tennis}.\nConsider K = KT \u222aKv1\u222aKv2. If we are interested in retrieving videos about sport, we may query K through the query concept Q = Video \u2293 \u2203About.SportKind and the answer will be the list containing both v1 and v2, as K |= v1:Q and K |= v2:Q hold."}, {"heading": null, "text": "On the other hand, if we are looking for individual sport videos, then, given the query concept Q\u2032 = Video \u2293 \u2203About.\u2203KindOfSport.IndividualSport, it follows that only video v2 will be retrieved. In fact, K 6|= v1:Q\u2032 and K |= v2:Q\u2032 hold. \u2737\n3. A Fuzzy DL\nOur fuzzy extension directly relates to Zadeh\u2019s work on fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1965). A fuzzy set S with respect to an universe U is characterised by a membership function \u00b5S : U \u2192 [0, 1], assigning an S-membership degree, \u00b5S(u), to each element u in U . \u00b5S(u) gives us an estimation of the belonging of u to S. Typically, if \u00b5S(u) = 1 then u definitely belongs to S, while \u00b5S(u) = 0.8 means that u is \u201clikely\u201d to be an element of S. Moreover, according to Zadeh, the membership function has to satisfy three well known restrictions: for all u \u2208 U and for all fuzzy sets S1, S2 with respect to U\n\u00b5S1\u2229S2(u) = min{\u00b5S1(u), \u00b5S2(u)} \u00b5S1\u222aS2(u) = max{\u00b5S1(u), \u00b5S2(u)} \u00b5\nS1 (u) = 1 \u2212 \u00b5S1(u) ,\nwhere S1 is the complement of S1 in U . Alternative restrictions on membership functions have been proposed in the literature, but it is not our aim to investigate them here (the interested reader may consult e.g. Dubois & Prade, 1980).\nA justification of the choice of the min and the max was given by Bellman and Giertz (1973), which have shown that under certain reasonable conditions min and max are the unique possible choice for set intersection and set union, respectively.\nWhen we switch to fuzzy logics, the notion of degree of membership \u00b5S(u) of an element u \u2208 U w.r.t. the fuzzy set S over U is regarded as the truth-value of the statement \u201cu is S\u201d. Accordingly, in our fuzzy DL, (i) a concept C, rather than being interpreted as a classical set, will be interpreted as a fuzzy set and, thus, concepts become imprecise; and, consequently, (ii) the statement \u201ca is C\u201d, i.e. a:C, will have a truth-value in [0, 1] given by the degree of membership of being the individual a a member of the fuzzy set C.\n3.1 Fuzzy Interpretation\nA fuzzy interpretation is now a pair I = (\u2206I , \u00b7I), where \u2206I is, as for the crisp case, the domain, whereas \u00b7I is an interpretation function mapping\n1. individuals as for the crisp case, i.e. aI 6= bI , if a 6= b;\n2. a concept C into a membership function CI : \u2206I \u2192 [0, 1];\n3. a role R into a membership function RI : \u2206I \u00d7 \u2206I \u2192 [0, 1].\nIf C is a concept then CI will naturally be interpreted as the membership degree function of the fuzzy concept (set) C w.r.t. I, i.e. if d \u2208 \u2206I is an object of the domain \u2206I then CI(d) gives us the degree of being the object d an element of the fuzzy concept C under the interpretation I. Similarly for roles. Additionally, the interpretation function \u00b7I has to satisfy the following equations: for all d \u2208 \u2206I ,"}, {"heading": null, "text": "\u22a4I(d) = 1 \u22a5I(d) = 0\n(C \u2293D)I(d) = min{CI(d), DI(d)}\n(C \u2294D)I(d) = max{CI(d), DI(d)}\n(\u00acC)I(d) = 1 \u2212 CI(d)\n(\u2200R.C)I(d) = infd\u2032\u2208\u2206I{max{1 \u2212R I(d, d\u2032), CI(d\u2032)}}\n(\u2203R.C)I(d) = supd\u2032\u2208\u2206I{min{R I(d, d\u2032), CI(d\u2032)}}.\nThese equations are the standard interpretation of conjunction, disjunction, negation and quantification, respectively (see Lee, 1972; Tresp & Molitor, 1998).\nNote that the semantics of \u2203R.C\n(\u2203R.C)I(d) = supd\u2032\u2208\u2206I{min{R I(d, d\u2032), CI(d\u2032)}} (14)\nis the result of viewing \u2203R.C as the open first order formula \u2203y.FR(x, y) \u2227 FC(y) (see (9)) and the existential quantifier \u2203 is viewed as a disjunction over the elements of the domain. Similarly,\n(\u2200R.C)I(d) = infd\u2032\u2208\u2206I{max{1 \u2212R I(d, d\u2032), CI(d\u2032)}} (15)\nis related to the open first order formula \u2200y.\u00acFR(x, y)\u2228FC(y) (see (8)), where the universal quantifier \u2200 is viewed as a conjunction over the elements of the domain.\nWe will say that two concepts C and D are said to be equivalent (denoted by C \u223c= D) when CI = DI for all interpretations I. As for the crisp non fuzzy case, dual relationships between concepts hold: e.g. \u22a4 \u223c= \u00ac \u22a5, (C \u2293D) \u223c= \u00ac(\u00acC \u2294 \u00acD) and (\u2200R.C) \u223c= \u00ac(\u2203R.\u00acC).\n3.2 Fuzzy Assertion\nA fuzzy assertion (denoted by \u03c8) is an expression having one of the following form \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 or \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 m\u3009, where \u03b1 is an ALC assertion, n \u2208 (0, 1] and m \u2208 [0, 1). From a semantics point of view, a fuzzy assertion \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 n\u3009 constrains the truth-value of \u03b1 to be less or equal to n (similarly for \u2265). Consequently, e.g. \u3008v1:Video \u2293 \u2203About.Basket \u2265 0.8\u3009 states that video v1 is likely about basket. Formally, an interpretation I satisfies a fuzzy assertion \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009 (resp. \u3008(a, b):R \u2265 n\u3009) iff CI(aI) \u2265 n (resp. RI(aI , bI) \u2265 n). Similarly, an interpretation I satisfies a fuzzy assertion \u3008a:C \u2264 n\u3009 (resp. \u3008(a, b):R \u2264 n\u3009) iff CI(aI) \u2264 n (resp. RI(aI , bI) \u2264 n). Two fuzzy assertions \u03c81 and \u03c82 are said to be equivalent (denoted by \u03c81\n\u223c= \u03c82) iff they are satisfied by the same set of interpretations. Notice that the combination of both \u3008a:C \u2265 m\u3009 and \u3008a:C \u2264 n\u3009, with m \u2264 n, restricts the truth-value of a:C in between [m,n]. Moreover, \u3008a:\u00acC \u2265 n\u3009 \u223c= \u3008a:C \u2264 1 \u2212 n\u3009. A primitive fuzzy assertion is a fuzzy assertion involving a primitive assertion.\nOne might wonder why we do not allow expressions of the form \u3008\u03b1 > n\u3009 or the form \u3008\u03b1 < n\u3009. The reason simply relies on the observation that it is quite hard to imagine situations in which we are able to assert such strict >,< relations. So we will leave them out for ease.4\n4. Of course, the whole can easily be extended in case we would like to consider these two types of assertions too."}, {"heading": null, "text": "Note that in the work of Straccia (1998), no fuzzy assertion of the form \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 n\u3009 is allowed.\n3.3 Fuzzy Terminological Axiom\nFuzzy terminological axioms we will consider are a natural extension of classical terminological axioms to the fuzzy case. From a syntax point of view, a fuzzy terminological axiom (denoted by \u03c4\u0303) is either a fuzzy concept specialisation or a fuzzy concept definition. A fuzzy concept specialisation is an expression of the form A\u227a\u00b7C, where A is a primitive concept and C is a concept. On the other hand, a fuzzy concept definition is an expression of the form A:\u2248 C, where A is a primitive concept and C is a concept. From a semantics point of view, we consider the natural extension of classical set inclusion to the fuzzy case (Zadeh, 1965). A fuzzy interpretation I satisfies a fuzzy concept specialisation A\u227a\u00b7C iff\n\u2200d \u2208 \u2206I , AI(d) \u2264 CI(d), (16)\nwhereas I satisfies a fuzzy concept definition A:\u2248 C iff\n\u2200d \u2208 \u2206I , AI(d) = CI(d). (17)\nNote that in the work of Straccia (1998) a fuzzy specialisation is \u201cnon-standard\u201d. Indeed, Straccia (1998) considered fuzzy specialisations of the form \u3008A \u2192 C \u2265 n\u3009 where (A \u2192 C)I = mind\u2208\u2206I{max{1 \u2212 A\nI(d), CI(d)}}. A drawback of this formulation is that it is not clear where the n in \u3008A \u2192 C \u2265 n\u3009 comes from, i.e. who defines the value n and how it is determined. We prefer to rely here on the standard interpretation of fuzzy subsets.\n3.4 Fuzzy Knowledge Base, Fuzzy Entailment and Fuzzy Subsumption\nA fuzzy knowledge base is a finite set of fuzzy assertions and fuzzy terminological axioms. As for the crisp case, with \u03a3A we will denote the set of fuzzy assertions in \u03a3, with \u03a3T we will denote the set of fuzzy terminological axioms in \u03a3 (the terminology), if \u03a3T = \u2205 then \u03a3 is purely assertional, and we will assume that a terminology \u03a3T is such that no concept A appears more than once on the left hand side of a fuzzy terminological axiom \u03c4\u0303 \u2208 \u03a3T and that no cyclic definitions are present in \u03a3T .\nAn interpretation I satisfies (is a model of ) a set of fuzzy \u03a3 iff I satisfies each element of \u03a3. A fuzzy KB \u03a3 fuzzy entails a fuzzy assertion \u03c8 (denoted by \u03a3|\u2248\u03c8) iff every model of \u03a3 also satisfies \u03c8.\nFurthermore, let \u03a3T be a terminology and let C,D be two concepts. We will say that D fuzzy subsumes C w.r.t. \u03a3T (denoted by C \u00b9\u03a3T D) iff for every model I of \u03a3T , \u2200d \u2208 \u2206I , CI(d) \u2264 DI(d) holds.\nFinally, given a fuzzy KB \u03a3 and an assertion \u03b1, it is of interest to compute \u03b1\u2019s best lower and upper truth-value bounds. To this end we define the greatest lower bound of \u03b1 w.r.t. \u03a3 (denoted by glb(\u03a3, \u03b1)) to be sup{n : \u03a3|\u2248\u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009}. Similarly, we define the least upper bound of \u03b1 with respect to \u03a3 (denoted by lub(\u03a3, \u03b1)) to be inf{n : \u03a3|\u2248\u3008\u03b1 \u2264 n\u3009} (sup \u2205 = 0, inf \u2205 = 1). Determining the lub and the glb is called the Best Truth-Value Bound (BTVB) problem."}, {"heading": null, "text": "4. Some Properties\nIn this section we discuss some properties of our fuzzy logic. Several properties described by Straccia (2000b) for the propositional case are easily extended to our first order case too.\n4.1 Concept Equivalence\nThe first ones are straightforward: \u00ac\u22a4 \u223c=\u22a5, C \u2293 \u22a4 \u223c= C, C \u2294 \u22a4 \u223c= \u22a4, C\u2293 \u22a5\u223c=\u22a5, C\u2294 \u22a5\u223c= C, \u00ac\u00acC \u223c= C, \u00ac(C\u2293D) \u223c= \u00acC\u2294\u00acD, \u00ac(C\u2294D) \u223c= \u00acC\u2293\u00acD, C1\u2293(C2\u2294C3) \u223c= (C1\u2293C2)\u2294(C1\u2293C3) and C1 \u2294 (C2 \u2293C3) \u223c= (C1 \u2294C2)\u2293 (C1 \u2294C3). For concepts involving roles, we have \u2200R.C \u223c= \u00ac\u2203R.\u00acC, \u2200R.\u22a4 \u223c= \u22a4, \u2203R. \u22a5\u223c=\u22a5 and (\u2200R.C) \u2293 (\u2200R.D) \u223c= \u2200R.(C \u2293D). Please, note that we do not have C \u2293 \u00acC \u223c=\u22a5, nor we have C \u2294 \u00acC \u223c= \u22a4 and, thus, (\u2203R.C) \u2293 (\u2200R.\u00acC) 6\u223c=\u22a5 and (\u2203R.C) \u2294 (\u2200R.\u00acC) 6\u223c= \u22a4 hold. In general we can only say that (C \u2293 \u00acC)I(d) \u2264 0.5, for any interpretation I and d \u2208 \u2206I and, similarly, (C \u2294 \u00acC)I(d) \u2265 0.5, i.e. lub(\u2205, a:\u00acC \u2293 C) = 0.5 and glb(\u2205, a:\u00acC \u2294 C) = 0.5, respectively.\n4.2 Entailment Relation\nOf course, \u03a3|\u2248\u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 iff glb(\u03a3, \u03b1) \u2265 n, and similarly \u03a3|\u2248\u3008\u03b1 \u2264 n\u3009 iff lub(\u03a3, \u03b1) \u2264 n hold. Concerning roles, note that \u03a3|\u2248\u3008(a, b):R \u2265 n\u3009 iff \u3008(a, b):R \u2265 m\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3 with m \u2265 n. Therefore,\nglb(\u03a3, R(a, b)) = max{n : \u3008R(a, b) \u2265 n\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3} (18)\nwhile the same is not true for the \u2264 case. While \u3008(a, b):R \u2264 m\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3 and m \u2264 n imply \u03a3|\u2248\u3008(a, b):R \u2264 n\u3009, the converse is false (e.g. {\u3008a:\u2200R.A \u2265 1\u3009, \u3008b:A \u2264 0\u3009}|\u2248\u3008(a, b):R \u2264 0\u3009)).\nFurthermore, from \u03a3|\u2248\u3008a:C \u2264 n\u3009 iff \u03a3|\u2248\u3008a:\u00acC \u2265 1 \u2212 n\u3009,\n1 \u2212 lub(\u03a3, C(a)) = 1 \u2212 inf{n : \u03a3|\u2248\u3008a:C \u2264 n\u3009} = sup{1 \u2212 n : \u03a3|\u2248\u3008a:C \u2264 n\u3009} = sup{n : \u03a3|\u2248\u3008a:C \u2264 1 \u2212 n\u3009} = sup{n : \u03a3|\u2248\u3008a:\u00acC \u2265 n\u3009} = glb(\u03a3, a:\u00acC).\nfollows. Therefore,\nlub(\u03a3, a:C) = 1 \u2212 glb(\u03a3, a:\u00acC), (19)\ni.e. lub can be determined through glb (and vice-versa). The same reduction to glb does not hold for lub(\u03a3, (a, b):R) as (a, b):\u00acR is not an expression of our language.5\nModus ponens on concepts is supported: if m > 1\u2212n then {\u3008a:C \u2265 m\u3009, \u3008a:\u00acC \u2294D \u2265 n\u3009}|\u2248 \u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009 holds.\nModus ponens on roles is supported: if m > 1\u2212 n then {\u3008(a, b):R \u2265 m\u3009, \u3008a:\u2200R.D \u2265 n\u3009} |\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009 and {\u3008a:\u2203R.C \u2265 m\u3009, \u3008a:\u2200R.D \u2265 n\u3009} |\u2248\u3008a:\u2203R.(C \u2293D) \u2265 min{n,m}\u3009 hold. Moreover, {\u3008a:\u2200R.C \u2265 m\u3009, \u3008a:\u2200R.D \u2265 n\u3009} |\u2248\u3008a:\u2200R.(C \u2293D) \u2265 min{n,m}\u3009 holds.\nModus ponens on specialisation is supported. The following degree bounds propagation through a taxonomy is supported. If C \u00b9\u03a3 D then (i) \u03a3 \u222a {\u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009}|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009; and (ii) \u03a3 \u222a {\u3008a:D \u2264 n\u3009}|\u2248\u3008a:C \u2264 n\u3009 hold.\n5. Of course, lub(\u03a3, (a, b):R) = 1 \u2212 glb(\u03a3, (a, b):\u00acR) holds, where (\u00acR)I(d, d\u2032) = 1 \u2212 RI(d, d\u2032)."}, {"heading": null, "text": "Note that, according to Straccia (1998)\nif m > 1 \u2212 n then {\u3008a:A \u2265 m\u3009, \u3008A \u2192 C \u2265 n\u3009}|\u2248\u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009.\nA drawback of the above property is that whatever the degree m is (as long as m > 1\u2212n), from \u3008a:A \u2265 m\u3009 and \u3008A \u2192 C \u2265 n\u3009 we infer \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009, where n is a priori fixed value.\n4.3 Soundness of the Semantics\nOur fuzzy semantics is sound w.r.t. crisp semantics. In fact, let \u03a3 be a fuzzy KB in which no \u3008(a, b):R \u2264 n\u3009 occurs. We leave these fuzzy assertions out, as role negation is not present in crisp ALC. Let us consider the following transformation \u266f(\u00b7) of fuzzy assertions into assertions, where \u266f(\u00b7) takes the \u201ccrisp\u201d assertional part of a fuzzy assertion:\n\u266f\u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 7\u2192 \u03b1\n\u266f\u3008a:C \u2264 n\u3009 7\u2192 a:\u00acC.\nWe extend \u266f(\u00b7) to fuzzy terminological axioms as follows: \u266f\u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4 . Finally, \u266f\u03a3 = {\u266f\u03c8 : \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a3} \u222a {\u266f\u03c4\u0303 : \u03c4\u0303 \u2208 \u03a3T }.\nIt is quite easily to verify that\nProposition 1 Let \u03a3 be a fuzzy KB in which no \u3008(a, b):R \u2264 n\u3009 occurs and let \u03c8 be a fuzzy assertion \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009. If \u03a3|\u2248\u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 then \u266f\u03a3 |= \u266f\u03c8 (i.e. there cannot be fuzzy entailment without entailment in ALC). \u22a3\nProof: Consider a classical interpretation I satisfying \u266f\u03a3. I is also a fuzzy interpretation such that CI(d) \u2208 {0, 1}, RI(d, d\u2032) \u2208 {0, 1} hold. By induction on the structure of a concept C it can be shown that I (classically) satisfies a:C iff CI(aI) = 1. Similarly for roles. Therefore, I is a fuzzy interpretation satisfying \u03a3. By hypothesis, I satisfies \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 and n > 0. Therefore, the truth-value of \u03b1 under I is 1, i.e. I satisfies \u03b1. \u2737 For the general case, \u03a3 has to be satisfiable as \u3008(a, b):R \u2264 n\u3009 may introduce an inconsistency, e.g. {\u3008(a, b):R \u2264 0.3\u3009, \u3008(a, b):R \u2265 0.4\u3009}|\u2248\u3008a:A \u2265 1\u3009, but {(a, b):R} 6|= a:A}.\nThe converse of Proposition 1 does not hold in general.\nExample 2 Let \u03a3 be the set \u03a3 = {\u3008a:A \u2294B \u2264 0.6\u3009, \u3008a:A \u2265 0.3\u3009}. It follows that \u266f\u03a3 = {a:\u00ac(A \u2294B), a:A} which is unsatisfiable. Therefore, it can easily be verified that \u266f\u03a3 |= a:B, but \u03a3 6|\u2248\u3008a:B \u2265 n\u3009, for all n > 0. \u2737\nOnce we restrict the attention to normalised fuzzy assertions, a converse relation follows immediately (Lee, 1972; Straccia, 2000b).\nIndeed, we say that a fuzzy assertion \u03c8 is KB-normalised iff\n1. if \u03c8 is \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 then n > 0.5;\n2. if \u03c8 is \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 n\u3009 then n < 0.5.\nWe say that a fuzzy assertion \u03c8 is query-normalised iff"}, {"heading": null, "text": "1. if \u03c8 is \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 then n \u2264 0.5;\n2. if \u03c8 is \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 n\u3009 then n \u2265 0.5.\nNote that the definitions for KB-normalisation and query-normalisation are dual. The following proposition follows from (Lee, 1972; Straccia, 2000b) and relies on the fact that \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 and \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 m\u3009 are together inconsistent, if n > 0.5 and m < 0.5. In particular, Straccia (2000b) shows that if \u03a3 and \u03c8 are a normalised fuzzy propositional KB and a query-normalised fuzzy proposition, then Then \u03a3|\u2248\u03c8 iff \u266f\u03a3 |= \u266f\u03c8. The proof is given by showing that from a deduction proving \u03a3|\u2248\u03c8 a deduction proving \u266f\u03a3 |= \u266f\u03c8 can be build and vice-versa. The extension to our case is straightforward as e.g. for n,m > 0.5, \u3008a:\u2200R.C \u2265 n\u3009,\u3008(a, b):R \u2265 m\u3009|\u2248\u3008b:C \u2265 n\u3009 iff a:\u2200R.C, (a, b):R |= b:C holds (the other firstorder cases involving \u2200 and \u2203 are similar).\nProposition 2 Let \u03a3 be a fuzzy KB in which no \u3008(a, b):R \u2264 n\u3009 occurs and each \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a3 is KB-normalised. Let \u03c8 be a query-normalised fuzzy assertion. Then \u03a3|\u2248\u03c8 iff \u266f\u03a3 |= \u266f\u03c8. \u22a3\nExample 3 Let \u03a3 be the set \u03a3 = {\u3008a:A \u2293B \u2264 0.4\u3009, \u3008a:A \u2265 0.6\u3009}. Let \u03c8 be \u3008a:B \u2264 0.7\u3009. Each fuzzy assertion in \u03a3 is KB-normalised and \u03c8 is query-normalised. It follows that \u266f\u03a3 = {a:\u00ac(A \u2293B), a:A} and \u266f\u03c8 = a:\u00acB. It is easily verified that \u03a3|\u2248\u03c8 and that \u266f\u03a3 |= \u266f\u03c8, thereby confirming Proposition 2. \u2737\n4.4 Subsumption\nAt first, as for the classical case and with the same method seen before, subsumption between two concepts C and D w.r.t. a terminology \u03a3T , i.e. C \u00b9\u03a3T D, can be reduced to the case of an empty terminology, i.e. C \u2032 \u00b9\u2205 D\n\u2032.\nExample 4 Suppose we have two images i1 and i2 each being a snapshot of the car traffic on a major street of an European city. An underlying image analysis tool recognizes, among all the recognised objects, that in image i1 there is a Ferrari, while in image i2 there is a Porsche. Furthermore, a semantic image indexing tool establishes that, to some degree n image i1 is about a Ferrari, whereas to some degree m image i2 is about a Porsche. Please note that, as a weight of a keyword in text is a quantitative description of the aboutness of the text w.r.t. the keyword, a truth-degree gives a quantitative description of the aboutness of an images w.r.t. an object, i.e. the aboutness is handled as an imprecise concept. So, let us consider\n\u03a3 = {\u3008i1:\u2203About.Ferrari \u2265 0.6\u3009, \u3008i2:\u2203About.Porsche \u2265 0.8\u3009, Ferrari\u227a\u00b7Car,Porsche\u227a\u00b7Car}.\nwhere the axioms specify that both a Ferrari and a Porsche are a car. According to the expansion process, \u03a3 will be replaced by\n\u03a3\u2032 = {\u3008i1:\u2203About.Ferrari \u2265 0.6\u3009, \u3008i2:\u2203About.Porsche \u2265 0.8\u3009, Ferrari:\u2248 Car \u2293 Ferrari\u2217,Porsche:\u2248 Car \u2293 Porsche\u2217},\nwhich will be simplified to"}, {"heading": null, "text": "\u03a3\u2032\u2032 = {\u3008i1:\u2203About.(Car \u2293 Ferrari\u2217) \u2265 0.6\u3009, \u3008i2:\u2203About.(Car \u2293 Porsche\u2217) \u2265 0.8\u3009}.\nNow, if we are looking for images which are about cars, then from \u03a3 we may infer that \u03a3 |\u2248 \u3008i1:\u2203About.Car \u2265 0.6\u3009 and \u03a3|\u2248\u3008i2:\u2203About.Car \u2265 0.8\u3009. Furthermore, it is easily verified that \u03a3\u2032\u2032 |\u2248 \u3008i1:\u2203About.Car \u2265 0.6\u3009 and \u03a3\u2032\u2032|\u2248\u3008i2:\u2203About.Car \u2265 0.8\u3009 hold as well. Indeed, for any fuzzy assertion \u03c8, \u03a3|\u2248\u03c8 iff \u03a3\u2032\u2032|\u2248\u03c8 holds. \u2737\nWe conclude this section with the analogue of Example 1 for the fuzzy case..\nExample 5 Consider the terminology KT and the query concept Q in Example 1. Let us define \u03a3T as the fuzzy KB derived from KT in which each terminological axiom \u03c4 has been replaced with the fuzzy terminological axiom \u03c4\u0303 . Moreover, let us suppose that an underlying semantic video indexing tool furnishes the following semantic descriptions of the two videos v1 and v2.\n\u03a3v1 = {\u3008v1:Video \u2265 1\u3009, \u3008v1:\u2203About.Basket \u2265 0.9\u3009} \u03a3v2 = {\u3008v2:Video \u2265 1\u3009, \u3008v2:\u2203About.Tennis \u2265 0.6\u3009},\ni.e. video v1 is about basket with degree 0.9, whereas video v2 is about tennis with degree 0.6. Let us consider \u03a3 = \u03a3T \u222a \u03a3v1 \u222a \u03a3v2. It is easily verified that glb(\u03a3, v1:Q) = 0.9, whereas glb(\u03a3, v2:Q) = 0.6 hold. Therefore, video v1 will be ranked before video v2 after the retrieval process. \u2737\n5. Decision Algorithms in Fuzzy ALC\nDeciding whether \u03a3|\u2248\u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 or \u03a3|\u2248\u3008\u03b1 \u2264 m\u3009 requires a calculus. Without loss of generality we will consider purely assertional fuzzy KBs only.\nWe will develop a calculus in the style of the constraint propagation method, as this method is usually proposed in the context of DLs (Buchheit et al., 1993a). The calculus extends the fuzzy propositional calculus described by Chen and Kundu (1996) and by Straccia (2000b) to our fuzzy DL case. We first address the entailment problem, then the subsumption problem and finally the BTVB problem. Both the subsumption problem and the BTVB problem will be reduced to the entailment problem.\n5.1 A Decision Procedure for the Entailment Problem\nConsider a new alphabet of ALC variables. An interpretation is extended to variables by mapping these into elements of the interpretation domain. An ALC object (denoted by w) is either an individual or a variable.6\nA constraint (denoted by \u03b1) is an expression of the form w:C or (w,w\u2032):R, where w,w\u2032\nare objects, C is an ALC concept and R is a role. A fuzzy constraint (denoted by \u03c8) is an expression having one of the following four forms: \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009, \u3008\u03b1 > n\u3009, \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 n\u3009, \u3008\u03b1 < n\u3009. Note that assertions and fuzzy assertions are constraints and fuzzy constraints, respectively.\n6. In the following, if there is no ambiguity, ALC variables and ALC objects are called variables and objects, respectively."}, {"heading": null, "text": "The definitions of satisfiability of a constraint, a fuzzy constraint, a set of constraints, a set of fuzzy constraints, primitive constraint and primitive fuzzy constraint are obvious.\nIt is quite easily verified that the fuzzy entailment problem can be reduced to the unsatisfiability problem of a set of fuzzy constraints:\n\u03a3|\u2248\u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 iff \u03a3 \u222a {\u3008\u03b1 < n\u3009} not satisfiable (20)\n\u03a3|\u2248\u3008\u03b1 \u2264 n\u3009 iff \u03a3 \u222a {\u3008\u03b1 > n\u3009} not satisfiable.

Given a fuzzy constraint \u03c8, with \u03c8c we indicate a conjugate of \u03c8 (if there exists one). Notice that a conjugate of a fuzzy constraint may be not unique, as there could be infinitely many. For instance, both \u3008a:C < 0.6\u3009 and \u3008a:C \u2264 0.7\u3009 are conjugates of \u3008a:C \u2265 0.8\u3009.

Any complete set of fuzzy constraints S2 obtained from a set of fuzzy constraints S1 by applying the above rules (23) is called a completion of S1. Due to the rules (\u2294\u2265), (\u2294>), (\u2293\u2264) and (\u2293<), more than one completion can be obtained. These rules are called nondeterministic rules.

Given the termination property, it is easily verified, by case analysis, that the\nabove rules are sound, i.e. if S1 is satisfiable then there is a satisfiable completion S2 of S1 and, thus, S2 contains no clash. For instance, let us show that the (\u2200\u2265) rule is sound. Assume I is an interpretation satisfying \u3008w1:\u2200R.C \u2265 n\u3009 and \u3008(w1, w2):R \u2265 m\u3009, where m > 1\u2212n. Let us show that I satisfies \u3008w2:C \u2265 n\u3009. Since I satisfies \u3008w1:\u2200R.C \u2265 n\u3009 it follows that max{1 \u2212 RI(w1\nI , w2 I), CI(w2\nI)} \u2265 n. But, RI(w1 I , w2\nI) \u2265 m and, thus, 1 \u2212 RI(w1\nI , w2 I) \u2264 1 \u2212 m < n. As a consequence, CI(w2\nI) \u2265 n follows, i.e. I satisfies \u3008w2:C \u2265 n\u3009.\n\u21d0 .) Suppose that there exists a clash free completion S\u2032 of S. We build from S\u2032 an interpretation I satisfying S\u2032 and, as S \u2286 S\u2032, I satisfies S. I is called canonical model.\nFor any primitive constraint \u03b1 \u2208 S\u2032, we collect its lower and upper bound restrictions in S\u2032 as follows: let\nN\u2265[\u03b1] = {n : \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 \u2208 S\u2032}\nN>[\u03b1] = {n : \u3008\u03b1 > n\u3009 \u2208 S\u2032}\nN\u2264[\u03b1] = {n : \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 n\u3009 \u2208 S\u2032}\nN<[\u03b1] = {n : \u3008\u03b1 < n\u3009 \u2208 S\u2032}."}, {"heading": null, "text": "We have to define I such that for each constraint \u03b1, I satisfies the constraints collected in the sets N (\u00b7)[\u03b1]: given N\u2265[\u03b1], the truth value n of \u03b1 under I has to be such that n \u2265 maxN\u2265[\u03b1], whereas w.r.t.

In each table we distinguish between the four cases where the sets are empty (no constraints) or not. For instance, if for a constraint w:A, only \u3008w:A \u2265 0.3\u3009, \u3008w:A > 0.4\u3009, \u3008w:A \u2264 0.5\u3009 and \u3008w:A < 0.6\u3009 are in S\u2032, then according to the first table bellow (row 4), for a \u01eb > 0, glb[w:A, \u01eb] = 0.4 + \u01eb, whereas lub[w:A, \u01eb] = 0.5.\nWe will define I such that AI(wI) = glb[w:A, \u01eb]. To make sure that glb[w:A, \u01eb] \u2264 AI(wI) \u2264 lub[w:A, \u01eb], we have to choose an \u01eb > 0 small enough such that glb[w:A, \u01eb] \u2264 lub[w:A, \u01eb], i.e. 0.4 + \u01eb \u2264 0.5. The existence of such an \u01eb > 0 is guaranteed by the fact that S\u2032 is clash-free. An additional condition that the choice of such an \u01eb has to satisfy concerns the case of a constraint \u03b1 of type (w,w\u2032):R. Let us show the problem with an example. Suppose S\u2032 is {\u3008(w,w\u2032):R > 0.3\u3009, \u3008w:\u2200R.B \u2265 0.6\u3009, \u3008w\u2032:B \u2264 0.5\u3009}. Therefore, according to the above tables, glb[(w,w\u2032):R, \u01eb1] = 0.3 + \u01eb1, lub[(w,w\n\u2032):R, \u01eb1] = 1, glb[w \u2032:B, \u01eb2] = 0\nand lub[w\u2032:B, \u01eb2] = 0.5. So, it seems that it is sufficient to choose an \u01eb1 > 0 such that 0.3 + \u01eb1 \u2264 1, which is indeed not the case. In fact, \u3008w:\u2200R.B \u2265 0.6\u3009 and \u3008w\n\u2032:B \u2264 0.5\u3009 introduces an upper bound on (w,w\u2032):R, i.e. the truth-value of (w,w\u2032):R under I has to be less or equal to 0.4 = 1\u2212 0.6. That is, we have to choose an \u01eb1 > 0 such that 0.3+ \u01eb1 \u2264 0.4. Otherwise, the truth-value of w\u2032:B under I has to be greater or equal to 0.6, contradicting lub[w\u2032:B, \u01eb2] = 0.5. Again, the existence of such an \u01eb is guaranteed as S\n\u2032 is clash-free.

We have shown that \u03a3 6|\u2248\u03c8\u2032 by constructing two clash-free completions from S. Let us consider the clash-free completion S1 in branch \u21261:\nS1 = \u03a3 \u222a { \u3008a:\u2203R.(D \u2293 C) < 0.5\u3009, \u3008(a, x):R \u2265 0.7\u3009, \u3008x:D \u2265 0.7\u3009, \u3008x:C \u2265 0.4\u3009, \u3008b:D \u2293 C < 0.5\u3009, \u3008x:D \u2293 C < 0.5\u3009, \u3008b:D < 0.5\u3009, \u3008x:C < 0.5\u3009}\nWe show that S1 is satisfiable by building an interpretation as described in the proof of Proposition 3. Accordingly, for \u01ebi > 0,"}, {"heading": null, "text": "glb[(a, b):R, \u01eb1] = 0.5 glb[b:C, \u01eb2] = 0.2 glb[b:D, \u01eb3] = 0.3 glb[(a, x):R, \u01eb4] = 0.7 glb[x:D, \u01eb5] = 0.7 glb[x:C, \u01eb6] = 0.4\nlub[(a, b):R, \u01eb1] = 1 lub[b:C, \u01eb2] = 1 lub[b:D, \u01eb3] = 0.5 \u2212 \u01eb3 lub[(a, x):R, \u01eb4] = 1 lub[x:D, \u01eb5] = 1 lub[x:C, \u01eb6] = 0.5 \u2212 \u01eb6.\nTherefore, we can freely choose \u01eb2, \u01eb4 and \u01eb5, whereas \u01eb3 and \u01eb6 have to be such that 0.3 \u2264 0.5 \u2212 \u01eb3 and 0.4 \u2264 0.5 \u2212 \u01eb6. As both \u3008(a, b):R \u2265 0.5\u3009 and \u3008a:\u2200R.C \u2265 0.4\u3009 are in S1, while \u3008b:C \u2265 0.4\u3009 6\u2208 S1, we have the additional restriction on the choice of \u01eb1 (see Equation 24) that glb[(a, b):R, \u01eb1] \u2264 0.6. But, glb[(a, b):R, \u01eb1] = 0.5 \u2264 0.6, for every \u01eb1 and, thus, the choice of \u01eb1 is also free. A solution to the \u01ebi is e.g. \u01ebi = 0.1 and, thus, let I be the following interpretation:\n1. the domain \u2206I is the set {a, b, x};\n2. wI = w, for all w \u2208 \u2206I ;\n3. \u22a4I(wI) = 1 and \u22a5I(wI) = 0, for all w \u2208 \u2206I ;\n4. CI(b) = 0.2, DI(b) = 0.3, DI(x) = 0.7 and CI(x) = 0.4 (in all other cases, AI(w) = 0); and\n5. RI(a, b) = 0.5 and RI(a, x) = 0.7 (in all other cases, R\u2032I(w,w\u2032) = 0).\nNow, it is easily verified that I satisfies S1 and S. \u2737\nFrom a computational complexity point of view, the fuzzy entailment problem can be proven to be a PSPACE-complete problem, as is the classical entailment problem.\nProposition 4 Let \u03a3 be a fuzzy KB and let \u03c8 be a fuzzy assertion. Determining whether \u03a3|\u2248\u03c8 is a PSPACE-complete problem. \u22a3\nProof: We have seen that termination of the above algorithm is guaranteed. Additionally, for a crisp KB K, define \u03a3K = {\u3008\u03b1 \u2265 1\u3009 : \u03b1 \u2208 K}. By definition, each \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a3K is KBnormalised and \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 0.5\u3009 is query-normalised. Then from Proposition 2 it follows that K |= \u03b1 iff \u03a3K |\u2248\u3008\u03b1 \u2265 0.5\u3009. From the PSPACE-completeness of the entailment problem in crisp ALC (Schmidt-Schau\u00df & Smolka, 1991), PSPACE-hardness of the fuzzy entailment problem follows. Unfortunately, our algorithm, as it is, requires exponential space due a well know problem inherited from the crisp case. Indeed, it easily verified that a completion of S = {x:C}, where C is the concept\n(\u2203R.A11) \u2293 (\u2203R.A12) \u2293 \u2200R.((\u2203R.A21) \u2293 (\u2203R.A22) \u2293 . . .\u2200R.((\u2203R.An1) \u2293 (\u2203R.An2)) . . .)\ncontains at least 2n + 1 variables. In order to require polynomial space, Schmidt-Schau\u00df and Smolka (1991) introduced the so-called trace rule (T\u2203) for the \u2203 operator. The (T\u2203) rule modifies the (\u2203) rule as shown below."}, {"heading": null, "text": "(\u2203) w:\u2203R.C \u2192 (w, x):R, x:C if x new variable and there is no w\u2032 such that both (w,w\u2032):R and w\u2032:C are already in the actual constraint set\n(T\u2203) w:\u2203R.C \u2192 (w, x):R, x:C if x new variable and no (w,w\u2032):R\u2032 is already in the actual set of constraints.\nThe difference between the (\u2203) rule and the (T\u2203) is that the latter is applied only once for an object w. We are thus compelled to make a nondeterministic choice amongst the constraints of the form w:\u2203R.C. Furthermore, it is convenient to apply a trace rule only if none of the other (\u2293), (\u2294), (\u00ac) and (\u2200) rules are applicable.\nWe say that a set of constraints S\u2032 is a trace of a set S if S\u2032 obtained from S by application of the rules where the (\u2203) has been replaced by (T\u2203). Schmidt-Schau\u00df and Smolka (1991) have shown that a set of constraints S = {x:C} is satisfiable iff no trace S\u2032\nof S contains a clash. As the size of a trace S\u2032 of S is bounded polynomially by the size of S, polynomial space is sufficient to prove satisfiability.\nThe above trace rule works if we start from a constraint set of the form {x:C}. In the general case, we have to rely on so-called pre-completions (Baader & Hollunder, 1991b; Donini et al., 1994). A set of constraints S\u2032 is said to be a pre-completion of a given set of constraints S, if it is obtained from S by the application of the (\u2293), (\u2294), (\u00ac) and (\u2200) rules, and none of these rules is applicable to S\u2032 (the size of S\u2032 is polynomially bounded by the size of S). As a consequence of this \u201cpre-processing\u201d step, all role relationships (w,w\u2032):R \u2208 S\u2032 can be ignored, i.e. removed from S\u2032, because they no longer carry any additional information. Now, in a second step we can apply the method above by checking whether no trace from S\u2032 contains a clash. In summary, a set of constraints S is satisfiable iff there is a pre-completion S\u2032 of S such that no trace S\u2032\u2032 of S\u2032 contains a clash.\nIn the fuzzy case, similar trace rules can easily be defined. For instance, the correspondent trace rule of the (\u2203\u2265) rule is\n(T\u2203\u2265) \u3008w:\u2203R.C \u2265 n\u3009 \u2192 \u3008(w, x):R \u2265 n\u3009, \u3008x:C \u2265 n\u3009 if x new variable and no \u3008(w,w\u2032):R\u2032 \u2265 m\u3009 is already in the actual set of fuzzy constraints.\nThe trace rules correspondent to the rules (\u2203>), (\u2200\u2264) and (\u2200<) are defined similarly. By proceeding as for the crisp case, it can be shown that (i) a set of fuzzy constraints S is satisfiable iff there is a pre-completion S\u2032 of S such that no trace S\u2032\u2032 of S\u2032 contains a clash; and (ii) the size of a trace S\u2032\u2032 of S is bounded polynomially by the size of S. As a consequence, the satisfiability problem is in PSPACE, which completes the proof. \u2737\nThis result establishes an important property about our fuzzy DL. In effect, it says that no additional computational cost has to be paid for the major expressive power.\n5.2 A Decision Procedure for the Subsumption Problem\nIn this section we address the subsumption problem, i.e. deciding whether C \u00b9\u03a3T D, where C and D are two concepts and \u03a3 is a fuzzy terminology. As we have seen (see Example 4),"}, {"heading": null, "text": "C \u00b9\u03a3T D can be reduced to the case of an empty terminology by applying the KB expansion process. So, without loss of generality, we can limit our attention to the case C \u00b9\u2205 D.\nAt first, an analogue to relation (12) holds. In fact, it can easily be shown that\nProposition 5 Let C and D be two concepts. It follows that C \u00b9\u2205 D iff for all n > 0 \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009, where a is a new individual. \u22a3\nProof: \u21d2 .) Assume that C \u00b9\u2205 D holds. Suppose to the contrary that \u2203n > 0 such that\n\u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009 6|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009. Therefore, there is an interpretation I and an n > 0 such that CI(aI) \u2265 n and DI(aI) < n. But, from the hypothesis n \u2264 CI(aI) \u2264 DI(aI) < n follows. Absurd.\n\u21d0 .) Assume that for all n > 0, \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009 holds. Suppose to the contrary that C 6\u00b9\u2205 D holds. Therefore, there is an interpretation I and d \u2208 \u2206\nI such that CI(d) > DI(d) \u2265 0. Let us extent I to a such that aI = d and consider n = CI(d) > 0. Of course, I satisfies \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009. Therefore, from the hypothesis it follows that I satisfies \u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009, i.e. DI(d) \u2265 n = CI(d) > DI(d). Absurd. \u2737 How can we check whether for all n > 0 \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009 holds? A solution to this problem, restricted to the propositional case, is given by Straccia (2000a). Indeed, it is shown that\nProposition 6 (Straccia, 2000a) Let p and q be two propositions, 0 < n1 \u2264 0.5 and 1 \u2265 n2 > 0.5. It follows that for all n > 0, \u3008p \u2265 n\u3009|\u2248\u3008q \u2265 n\u3009 iff for both m \u2208 {n1, n2}, \u3008p \u2265 m\u3009|\u2248\u3008q \u2265 m\u3009 holds. \u22a3\nThe above proposition establishes that, at the propositional level, in order to check whether \u3008p \u2265 n\u3009|\u2248\u3008q \u2265 n\u3009 holds for all n, it is sufficient to check the entailment relation with respect to two values n1, n2. The first being less or equal than 0.5, while the second being greater than 0.5, respectively. This is due to the fact that for given values n, n\u2032 \u2264 0.5, any proof of \u3008p \u2265 n\u3009|\u2248\u3008q \u2265 n\u3009 can be converted into a proof for \u3008p \u2265 n\u2032\u3009|\u2248\u3008q \u2265 n\u2032\u3009 and vice-versa. The case where n, n\u2032 > 0.5 is similar.\nThe above proposition can be extended to our fuzzy DL as well.\nLemma 1 Let C and D be two concepts, 0 < n, n\u2032 \u2264 0.5 and let a be an individual. It follows that \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009 iff \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u2032\u3009|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u2032\u3009. \u22a3\nProof: It is enough to show that S = {\u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009, \u3008a:D < n\u3009} is satisfiable iff S\u2032 = {\u3008a:C \u2265 n\u2032\u3009, \u3008a:D < n\u2032\u3009} is satisfiable.\n\u21d2 .) Assume that S is satisfiable. So, there is a clash-free completion S\u0303 of S. With S\u0303[n/n\u2032] we indicate the set of fuzzy constraints obtained from S\u0303, by replacing any value n in S\u0303 with n\u2032 and any value 1 \u2212 n in S\u0303 with 1 \u2212 n\u2032, respectively. We will show that S\u0303[n/n\u2032] is a clash-free completion of S\u2032 and, thus, S\u2032 is satisfiable.\nLet r1, . . . , rk, k \u2265 0 be the sequence of inference rule applications, which applied to S get S\u0303.

(iii) So, S\u0303\u20320 is a completion of S \u2032. We show that S\u0303\u20320 is clash-\nfree. Assume to the contrary that S\u0303\u20320, i.e. S \u2032 contains a clash. As a consequence,\nS\u2032 = {\u3008a:C \u2265 n\u2032\u3009, \u3008a:C < n\u2032\u3009}. But then, S is {\u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009, \u3008a:C < n\u3009}, contrary to the assumption that S is clash-free.\ninduction step: by case analysis on the rule rk. We limit our presentation to the (\u2200\u2265) rule as for the other the proof is similar.\nIf rk is (\u2200\u2265) then it can be verified that there are \u3008w:\u2200R.C \u2032 \u2265 n\u3009 and \u3008(w,w\u2032):R > 1 \u2212 n\u3009\nin S\u0303k\u22121 such that \u3008w \u2032:C \u2032 \u2265 n\u3009 6\u2208 S\u0303k\u22121 and \u3008w\n\u2032:C \u2032 \u2265 n\u3009 \u2208 S\u0303k. By induction, S\u0303k\u22121[n/n \u2032] =\nS\u0303\u2032k\u22121 and, thus, both \u3008w:\u2200R.C \u2032 \u2265 n\u2032\u3009 and \u3008(w,w\u2032):R > 1 \u2212 n\u2032\u3009 are in S\u0303\u2032k\u22121, while\n\u3008w\u2032:C \u2032 \u2265 n\u2032\u3009 6\u2208 S\u0303\u2032k\u22121. Therefore, (i) rule rk is applicable to S\u0303\u2032k\u22121 and \u3008w \u2032:C \u2032 \u2265 n\u2032\u3009 \u2208\nS\u0303\u2032k; (ii) so, S\u0303\u2032k = S\u0303k[n/n \u2032]; (iii) from S\u0303\u2032k = S\u0303k[n/n\n\u2032] and, as S\u0303k is a completion of S, by case analysis, it is easily verified that no rule is further applicable to S\u0303\u2032k. Therefore, S\u0303\u2032k is a completion of S\n\u2032. Let us show that S\u0303\u2032k is clash free. Assume to the contrary that S\u0303\u2032k contains a clash. If one of the cases in Table 1 holds, then from S\u0303\u2032k = S\u0303k[n/n\n\u2032] it follows easily that there is a clash in S\u0303k as well, which is contrary to assumption that S\u0303k is clash-free. On the other hand, if there is a conjugated pair of fuzzy constraints in S\u0303\u2032k (see Table 2), then one of the following three pairs is in S\u0303\u2032k: (a) \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u2032\u3009 and \u3008\u03b1 < n\u2032\u3009; (b) \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 1 \u2212 n\u2032\u3009 and \u3008\u03b1 > 1 \u2212 n\u2032\u3009; and (c) \u3008\u03b1 < n\u2032\u3009 and \u3008\u03b1 > 1 \u2212 n\u2032\u3009 (note that n, n\u2032 \u2264 0.5). Again, as S\u0303\u2032k = S\u0303k[n/n\n\u2032], it follows that there is a conjugated pair in S\u0303k as well, which is contrary to assumption that S\u0303k is clash-free.\n\u21d0 .) Can be proven similarly to \u21d2 .). \u2737\nBy proceeding as for Lemma 1 it can be shown that\nLemma 2 Let C and D be two concepts, 1 \u2265 n, n\u2032 > 0.5 and let a be an individual. It follows that \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009 iff \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u2032\u3009|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u2032\u3009. \u22a3\nFrom Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 it follows that\nProposition 7 Let C and D be two concepts, 0 < n1 \u2264 0.5, 1 \u2265 n2 > 0.5 and let a be an individual. It follows that for all n > 0 \u3008a:C \u2265 n\u3009|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 n\u3009 iff for both m \u2208 {n1, n2}, \u3008a:C \u2265 m\u3009|\u2248\u3008a:D \u2265 m\u3009 holds. \u22a3\nAs a consequence, the subsumption problem can be reduced to the entailment problem for which we have a decision algorithm."}, {"heading": null, "text": "5.3 A Decision Procedure for the BTVB Problem\nWe address now the problem of determining glb(\u03a3, \u03b1) and lub(\u03a3, \u03b1). This is important, as computing, e.g. glb(\u03a3, \u03b1), is in fact the way to answer a query of type \u201cto which degree is \u03b1 (at least) true, given the (imprecise) facts in \u03a3?\u201d.\nWithout loss of generality, we will assume that all concepts are in NNF (Negation Normal Form). Straccia (2000b) has shown that, in case of fuzzy propositional logic, from a set \u03a3 of fuzzy propositions of the form \u3008p \u2265 n\u3009 and \u3008p \u2264 n\u3009, where p is a proposition, it is possible to determine a finite set N\u03a3 \u2282 [0, 1], where |N\u03a3| is O(|\u03a3|), such that glb(\u03a3, q) \u2208 N\u03a3, i.e. the greatest lower bound of a proposition q w.r.t. \u03a3 has to be an element of N\u03a3. Therefore, glb(\u03a3, q) can be determined by computing the greatest value n \u2208 N\u03a3 such that \u03a3|\u2248\u3008q \u2265 n\u3009. An easy way to search for this n is to order the elements of N\u03a3 and then to perform a binary search among these values by successive entailment tests. Dually, as lub(\u03a3, q) = 1 \u2212 glb(\u03a3,\u00acq) holds, the lub can either be computed from the glb or, as lub(\u03a3, q) \u2208 1 \u2212N\u03a3, where 1 \u2212N\u03a3 = {1 \u2212 n : n \u2208 N\u03a3}, we can compute it by determining the smallest value in 1 \u2212N\u03a3.\nProposition 8 (Straccia, 2000b) Let \u03a3 be a set of fuzzy propositions in NNF and let q be a proposition. Then glb(\u03a3, q) \u2208 N\u03a3 and lub(\u03a3, q) \u2208 1 \u2212N\u03a3, where\nN\u03a3 = {0, 0.5, 1} \u222a {n : \u3008p \u2265 n\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3} \u222a {1 \u2212 n : \u3008p \u2264 n\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3}\n1 \u2212N\u03a3 = {1 \u2212 n : n \u2208 N\u03a3}.\n\u22a3\nThe above Proposition 8 can easily be extended our fuzzy description logic case. Essentially, the quantifiers do not change the possible values of glb(\u03a3, F ) and lub(\u03a3, F ).\nProposition 9 Let \u03a3 be a set of fuzzy assertions in NNF and let \u03b1 be an assertion. Then glb(\u03a3, \u03b1) \u2208 N\u03a3 and lub(\u03a3, \u03b1) \u2208 1 \u2212N\u03a3, where\nN\u03a3 = {0, 0.5, 1} \u222a {n : \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 n\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3} \u222a {1 \u2212 n : \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 n\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3}\n1 \u2212N\u03a3 = {1 \u2212 n : n \u2208 N\u03a3}.\n\u22a3\nProof: Let us show that glb(\u03a3, \u03b1) \u2208 N\u03a3. Let m be glb(\u03a3, \u03b1). By definition, if m = 0 then S = \u03a3\u222a {\u3008\u03b1 < n\u3009} is satisfiable for any n > 0 and 0 \u2208 N\u03a3. Otherwise, m > 0 is the largest value such that S = \u03a3\u222a {\u3008\u03b1 < m\u3009} is not satisfiable. Let us mark each sub-expression in \u03b1 with a \u2217, so that we can trace the components of the query assertion \u03b1 during a deduction."}, {"heading": null, "text": "Consider a completion S\u2032 of S. Starting from \u3008\u03b1 < m\u3009, by applying the rules of inference, only \u2217 marked expressions of type \u3008\u03b1\u2032 < m\u3009 or \u3008\u03b1\u2032 > 1 \u2212m\u3009 can appear in S\u2032. Furthermore, as S is not satisfiable, S\u2032 contains a clash, i.e. the value m is the largest value such that all completions S\u2032 of S contain a clash. Let us analyse S\u2032. As S\u2032 contains a clash, then either (i) there is a clash according to Table 1, or (ii) there is a clash according to Table 2. If (i) is the case, i.e. there is \u03c8 \u2208 S\u2032 which is a clash, then we have to distinguish between two cases: (a) \u03c8 is not marked with \u2217 and (b) \u03c8 is marked with \u2217. In the former case, S\u2032\ncontains a clash independently of the value m and, thus, the largest possible value m for which S\u2032 contains a clash is 1. In the latter case, as m > 0, either \u03c8 = \u3008w:\u22a5 > 1 \u2212m\u3009 or \u03c8 = \u3008w:\u22a4 < m\u3009 which are both clashes for any value of m. As a consequence, the largest possible value m for which S\u2032 contains a clash according to Table 1 is 1. Assume (ii) is the case, i.e. a conjugated pair of fuzzy constraints \u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 is in S\u2032. Similarly to the previous case, we have to distinguish the cases for which \u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 are marked with \u2217. There are four cases:\n(a) \u03c8 = \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 k\u3009 and \u03c8\u2032 = \u3008\u03b1\u2032 \u2264 k\u2032\u3009 are in S\u2032, none is marked with \u2217 and k > k\u2032. Therefore, S\u2032 contains a clash for any value of m and, thus, the largest choice is 1;\n(b) \u03c8 = \u3008\u03b1 \u2265 k\u3009 and \u03c8\u2032 = \u3008\u03b1\u2032 < m\u3009 are in S\u2032, only \u03c8\u2032 is marked with \u2217 and k \u2265 m. Therefore, S\u2032 contains a clash for any value of m \u2264 k and, thus, the largest choice for m is k. It is easily verified by case analysis on the rules that from \u03c8 \u2208 S\u2032, k \u2208 N\u03a3 follows;\n(c) \u03c8 = \u3008\u03b1 \u2264 k\u3009 and \u03c8\u2032 = \u3008\u03b1\u2032 > 1 \u2212m\u3009 are in S\u2032, only \u03c8\u2032 is marked with \u2217 and k \u2264 1\u2212m. Therefore, S\u2032 contains a clash for any value of m \u2264 1 \u2212 k and, thus, the largest choice for m is 1 \u2212 k. It is easily verified by case analysis on the rules that from \u03c8 \u2208 S\u2032, 1 \u2212 k \u2208 N\u03a3\nfollows;\n(d) \u03c8 = \u3008\u03b1 < m\u3009 and \u03c8\u2032 = \u3008\u03b1\u2032 > 1 \u2212m\u3009 are in S\u2032, both are marked with \u2217 and m \u2264 1\u2212m. Therefore, S\u2032 contains a clash for any value of m \u2264 0.5 and, thus, the largest choice for m is 0.5.\nSumming up, we have proved that the largest possible value for m is such that m \u2208 N\u03a3. \u2737\nThe algorithms computing glb(\u03a3, \u03b1) and lub(\u03a3, \u03b1) are described in Table 3. For instance, by a binary search on N\u03a3, the value of glb(\u03a3, \u03b1) can be determined in at most log |N\u03a3| fuzzy entailment tests.\n6. Conclusions and Future Work\nIn this work, we have presented a quite general fuzzy extension of the DL ALC, a significant and expressive representative of the various DLs. Our fuzzy DL enables us to reason in presence of imprecise ALC concepts, i.e. fuzzy ALC concepts. From a semantics point of view, fuzzy concepts are interpreted as fuzzy sets i.e. given a concept C and an individual a, C(a) is interpreted as the truth-value of the sentence \u201ca is C\u201d. From a syntax point of view, we allow to specify lower and upper bounds of the truth-value of C(a). Complete algorithms for reasoning in it have been presented, that is, we have devised algorithms for solving the entailment problem, the subsumption problem as well as the best truth-value bound problem."}, {"heading": null, "text": "Algorithm Max(\u03a3, \u03b1) Set Min := 0 and Max := 2.\n1.

The complexity result shows that the additional expressive power has no impact from a computational complexity point of view.\nThe extension of DLs to the management of vagueness is not new (Tresp & Molitor, 1998; Yen, 1991). Yen was the first, to the best of my knowledge, introducing vagueness into a simple DL. His language has two interesting points not included into our language. Firstly, it allows the definition of vague concepts by means of explicit membership functions over a domain, e.g. LowPressure:\u2248 domain(AirPressure);membershipfx(\u03bbp.low(p)). Here the domain over p ranges is given by AirPressure. \u03bbp.low(p) determines the membership degree of being a pressure p low. Secondly, the language allows concept modifiers, like Very or Slightly, by means of which concepts like \u201cvery low pressure\u201d can be defined through VeryLowPressure:\u2248 Very(LowPressure). This last idea has been generalised to ALC by Tresp and Molitor (1998) where a certain type of concept modifiers are allowed. Strictly speaking, the language defined by Tresp and Molitor is more expressive, as we do not consider concept modifiers. From a semantics point of view, the extension to Tresp and Molitor\u2019s language is quite straightforward. But, the cost that we have to pay for this increasing expressive power is that, from a computational complexity and algorithms point of view, things changes radically. Indeed, according to Tresp and Molitor for each \u201ccompletion\u201d a linear optimisation problem is generated (set of inequations of the form op1(t1)Rop2(t2) or op1(t1)Rf(op2(t2)), where ti is a truth-value variable, R \u2208 {\u2264,\u2265,=, opi \u2208 {id,mi}, with id(t) the identity and mi(t) is a modifier function over truth-value variables, respectively, and f \u2208 {min,max}-derived from the semantics of the connectors \u2293,\u2294) and then solved for the best value. Then, the minimum among all computed solutions is taken. The solutions can be computed by relying on methods from the domain of linear programming, e.g. the"}, {"heading": null, "text": "simplex method (Papadimitriou & Steiglitz, 1982). While it is possible to devise a similar approach for our fuzzy DL as well, we have seen that this is not necessary.\nBoth aspects considered by Tresp and Molitor and by Yen, although interesting, are not crucial w.r.t. how we model logic-based multimedia information retrieval, where underlaying text, image and video analysis tools provide us fuzzy assertions e.g. of the form \u3008a:\u2203About.C \u2265 n\u3009 from which we may infer \u3008a:\u2203About.D \u2265 m\u3009.\nThis work can be used as a basis both for extending existing DL based systems and for further research. In this latter case, there are several open points. For instance, it is not clear yet how to reason both in case of fuzzy specialisation of the general form C\u227a\u00b7D and in the case cycles are allowed in a fuzzy KB. Another interesting topic for further research concerns the semantics of fuzzy connectives. Of course several other choices for the semantics of the connectives \u2293,\u2294,\u00ac,\u2203,\u2200 can be considered. While for a huge number of proposals given in the literature their impact from a semantics point of view is well understood, the question how they impact from a computational complexity and algorithms point of view remains still open.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on an early version of this paper.

They allow reasoning about individuals and well defined concepts, i.e. set of individuals with common properties. The experience in using DLs in applications has shown that in many cases we would like to extend their capabilities. In particular, their use in the context of Multimedia Information Retrieval (MIR) leads to the convincement that such DLs should allow the treatment of the inherent imprecision in multimedia object content representation and retrieval. In this paper we will present a fuzzy extension of ALC, combining Zadeh\u2019s fuzzy logic with a classical DL.
