INTRODUCTION", "text": "The natural language processing community is in the strong position of having many available approaches to solve some of its most fundamental problems [1]. We have taken Myanmar language for information processing. Myanmar is an agglutinative language with a very productive inflectional system. This means that for any NLP application on Myanmar to be successful, some amount of functional analysis is necessary. Without it, the development of grammatical relations would not be feasible due to the sparse data problem bound to exist in the training data. Our approach is a part of the Myanmar to English machine translation project. If high quality translation is to be achieved, language understanding is a necessity. One problem in Myanmar language processing is the lack of grammatical regularity in the language. This leads to very complex Myanmar grammar in order to obtain satisfactory results, which in term increases the complexity in the parsing process, it is desired that simple grammar is to be used.\nOur proposed method makes use of two components. They are function tagging and parsing. Function tags are useful for any application trying to follow the thread of the text \u2013they find the \u2018who does what\u2019 of each clause, which can be useful to gain information about the situation or to learn more about the behaviour of words in the sentence [2]. The goal of function tagging is to assign syntactic categories like subject, object, time and location to each word in the text document. In case of function tagging, we use Naive Bayes theory and the functional annotated tagged corpus. Parsing is the process of analyzing a text or sentence that is made up of a sequence of words called tokens, and to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given grammatical rules. The goal of the second one is to produce the parse tree of the sentences in Myanmar text.\nIn our approach, we take the chunk level phrase with the combination of POS tag and its category which is the output of a fully described morphological analyzer [3][4], which is very important for agglutinative languages like Myanmar. A small corpus annotated manually serves as training data because the large scale Myanmar Corpus is unavailable at present. Since the large-scale annotated corpora, such as Penn Treebank, have been built in English, statistical knowledge extracted from them has been shown to be more and more crucial for natural language disambiguation [5]. As a distinctive language, Myanmar has many characteristics different from English. The use of statistical information efficiently in Myanmar language is still a virgin land waiting to explore.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as in the followings. Next, in the Related Work section, we analyze previous efforts related to the tasks of function tagging and parsing. Section 3 explains Myanmar language. Section 4 describes about corpus statistics. Section 5 explains the procedure of proposed system. Section 6 includes the function tag sets. Section 7 describes about the proposed grammar for Myanmar language. Function tagging model is presented in section 8. Section 9 describes about parsing of Myanmar simple and complex sentences. Section 10 explains about experimental results. Finally the conclusion of the paper is presented."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Blaheta and Johnson [6] addressed the task of function tags assignment. They used a statistical algorithm based on a set of features grouped in trees, rather than chains. The advantage was that features can better contribute to overall performance for cases when several features are sparse. When such features are conditioned in a chain model the sparseness of a feature can have a dilution effect of an ulterior (conditioned) one.\nMihai Lintean and Vasile Rus[7] described the use of two machine learning techniques, naive Bayes and decision trees, to address the task of assigning function tags to nodes in a syntactic parse tree. They used a set of features inspired from Blaheta and Johnson [6]. The set of classes they used in their model corresponds to the set of functional tags in Penn Treebank. To generate the training data, they have considered only nodes with functional tags, ignoring nodes unlabeled with such tags. They trained the classifiers on sections 1-21 from Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of Penn Treebank and used section 23 to evaluate the generated classifiers.\nYong-uk Park and Hyuk-chul Kwon [8] tried to disambiguate for syntactic analysis system by many dependency rules and segmentation. Segmentation is made during parsing. If two adjacent morphemes have no syntactic relations, their syntactic analyzer makes new segment between these two morphemes, and find out all possible partial parse trees of that segmentation and combine them into complete parse trees. Also they used adjacent-rule and adverb subcategorization to disambiguate of syntactic analysis. Their syntactic analyzer system used morphemes for the basic unit of parsing. They made all possible partial parse trees on each segmentation process, and tried to combine them into complete parse trees.\nMark-Jan Nederhof and Giorgio Satta[9] considered the problem of parsing non-recursive context-free grammars, i.e., context-free grammars that generate finite languages and presented two tabular algorithms for these grammars. They presented their parsing algorithm, based on the CYK (Cocke\u2013Younger\u2013Kasami) algorithm and Earley\u2019s alogrithm. As parsing CFG (contextfree grammar), they have taken a small hand-written grammar of about 100 rules. They have ordered the input grammars by size, according to the number of nonterminals (or the number of nodes in the forest, following the terminology by Langkilde (2000)).\nKyongho Min and William H. Wilson [10] discussed the robustness of four efficient syntactic error-correcting parsing algorithms that are based on chart parsing with a context-free grammar. They implemented four versions of a bottom-up error-correcting chart parser: a basic bottom-up chart parser, and chart parsers employing selectivity, top-down filtering, and a combination of selectivity and a top-down filtering. They detected and corrected syntactic errors using a system\ncomponent called IFSCP (Ill-Formed Sentence Chart Parser) described by Min & Wilson (1994), together with a spelling correction module. They tested 4 different lengths of sentences (3, 5, 7, and 11) and 5 different error types, with a grammar of 210 context-free rules designed to parse a simple declarative sentence with no conjunctions, passivisation, or relative clauses."}, {"heading": "3. MYANMAR LANGUAGE", "text": "Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) is one of the South-East Asian countries. There are 135 ethnic groups living in Myanmar. These ethnic groups speak more than one language and use different scripts to present their respective languages. There are a total of 109 languages spoken by the people living in Myanmar [11]. The Myanmar language is the official language and is more than one thousand years old."}, {"heading": "3.1. Features of Myanmar Language", "text": "Generally Myanmar sentence follows the subject, object, and verb pattern. However the interchange of subject, object is acceptable. Unlike English language Myanmar is syntax of relatively free-phrase-order language. Myanmar phrases can be written in any order as long as the verb phrase is at the end of sentence. This can be easily illustrated with the example \u201c\u101e\u1030\u101e\u100a\u1039 \u1005\u102c\u1021\u102f\u1015\u1039\u1000\u102f\u102d \u1005\u102c\u1038\u1015\u103c\u1032\u1031\u1015\u105a\u1010\u103c\u1004\u1039 \u1011\u102c\u1038\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b\u201d (He places the book on the table) as shown in table 1. All are valid sentences [12].\nIn all the cases, subject is \u101e\u1030 (He), object is \u1005\u102c\u1021\u102f\u1015\u1039\u1000\u102d\u102f (the book), place is \u1005\u102c\u1038\u1015\u103c\u1032\u1031\u1015\u105a\u1010\u103c\u1004\u1039 (on the table) and verb is \u1011\u102c\u1038\u101e\u100a\u1039 (places). From the above example, it is clear that phrase order does not determine the functional structure in Myanmar language and permits scrambling. Myanmar language follows Subject-Object-Verb orders in contradiction with English language."}, {"heading": "3.2. Issues of Myanmar Language", "text": "The highly agglutinative language like Myanmar, nouns and verbs get inflected. Many times we need to depend on syntactic function or context to decide upon whether the particular word is a noun or adjective or adverb or post position [12]. This leads to the complexity in Myanmar grammatical relations. A noun may be categorized as common, proper or compound. Similarly, verb may be finite, infinite, gerund or contingent.\nA number of issues are affecting the function tagging for Myanmar language.\n The subject or object of the sentence can be skipped, and still be a valid sentence. For example: \u101b\u1014\u1039\u1000\u102f\u1014\u1039 - \u101e\u102f\u102d\u1094 - \u101e\u103c\u102c\u1038\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b Yangon - to - go (Go to Yangon)\n Myanmar language makes prominent usage of particles, which are untranslatable words that are suffixed or prefixed to words to indicate level of respect, grammatical tense, or mood. For example: \u1031\u1019\u102c\u1004\u1039\u1031\u1019\u102c\u1004\u1039 - \u1019\u103a\u102c\u1038 - \u1015\u1011\u1019 - \u1006\u102f - \u101b - \u101c\u103d\u103a\u1004\u1039 - \u101e\u1030\u1094\u1019\u102d\u1018\u1019\u103a\u102c\u1038 - \u1000 - \u1021\u1036\u1037\u107e\u101e - \u101c\u102d\u1019\u1037\u1039\u1019\u100a\u1039\u104b Mg Mg - particle - first - prize - wins - if - his parents - PPM - surprise - will (If Mg Mg wins the first prize, his parents will surprise.)  In Myanmar language, an adjective can specialize before or after a noun unlike other languages. For example: \u101e\u1030\u101e\u100a\u1039 - \u1001\u103a\u1019\u1039\u1038\u101e\u102c\u1031\u101e\u102c - \u101c\u1030 -\u1010\u1005\u1039\u1031\u101a\u102c\u1000\u1039 -\u103b\u1016\u1005\u1039\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b He - rich - man - a - is (or) \u101e\u1030\u101e\u100a\u1039 - \u101c\u1030 - \u1001\u103a\u1019\u1039\u1038\u101e\u102c - \u1010\u1005\u1039\u1031\u101a\u102c\u1000\u1039 -\u103b\u1016\u1005\u1039\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b He - man - rich - a - is (He is a rich man.)\n The subject /object can be another sentence, which does not contain subject or object. For example: \u1000\u1031\u101c\u1038\u1019\u103a\u102c\u1038\u101e\u1005\u1039\u1015\u1004\u1039\u1031\u1021\u102c\u1000\u1039\u1010\u103c\u1004\u1039\u1000\u1005\u102c\u1038\u1031\u1014\u101e\u100a\u1039 \u1000\u102f\u102d \u1000\u107d\u103c\u1014\u1039\u1031\u1010\u102c\u1039\u103b\u1019\u1004\u1039\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b (I see the children playing under the tree.)  The postpositions of subject phrases or object phrases can be hidden. For example: \u101e\u1030\u101e\u100a\u1039- \u1006\u101b\u102c\u1040\u1014\u1039 -\u1010\u1005\u1039\u1031\u101a\u102c\u1000\u1039 - \u103b\u1016\u1005\u1039\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b He - doctor - a - is (or) \u101e\u1030 - \u1006\u101b\u102c\u1040\u1014\u1039 - \u1010\u1005\u1039\u1031\u101a\u102c\u1000\u1039 - \u103b\u1016\u1005\u1039\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b He - doctor - a - is (He is a doctor.)\n The postpositions of time phrases or place phrases can be omitted. For example: \u101e\u1030\u1019 - \u1031\u1000\u103a\u102c\u1004\u1039\u1038 - \u101e\u102f\u102d\u1094 - \u101e\u103c\u102c\u1038\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b She - school - to - goes (or) \u101e\u1030\u1019 - \u1031\u1000\u103a\u102c\u1004\u1039\u1038 - \u101e\u103c\u102c\u1038\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b She - school - goes (She goes to school.)\nThese issues will cause a lot of problem during function tagging, and a lot of possible tags will be resulted."}, {"heading": "3.3. Grammar of Myanmar Language", "text": "Grammar studies the rules behind languages. The aspect of grammar that does not concern meaning directly is called syntax. Myanmar (syntax: SOV), because of its use of postposition (wi.Bat), would probably be defined as a \u201cpostpositional language\u201d, whereas English (syntax: SVO) because of its use of preposition would probably be defined as a \u201cprepositional language\u201d.\nThere are really only two parts of speech in Myanmar, the noun and the verb, instead of the usually accepted eight parts (Pe Maung Tin 1956:195). Most Myanmar linguists [13] accepted there are eight parts of speech in Myanmar. Myanmar nouns and verbs need the help of suffixes or particles to show grammatical relations.\nFor example: \u1031\u1000\u103a\u102c\u1004\u1039\u1038\u101e\u1030\u1019\u103a\u102c\u1038\u101e\u102c \u1002\u102f\u100f\u1039\u1011\u1030\u1038\u101b\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b \u101e\u1030\u1010\u102f\u102d\u1094\u101e\u100a\u1039 \u1021\u1010\u1014\u1039\u1038\u1011\u1032\u1019\u103d\u102c \u1090\u102d\u103d\u107e\u1000\u104f\u104b\nMyanmar is a highly verb-prominent language and that suppression of the subject and omission of personal pronouns in connected text result in a reduced role of nominals. This observation misses the critical role of postposition particles marking sentential arguments and also of the verb itself being so marked. The key to the view of Myanmar being structures by nominals is found in the role of the particles. Some particles modify the word's part of speech. Among the most prominent of these is the particle \u1021, which is prefixed to verbs and adjectives to form nouns or adverbs.There is a wide variety of particles in Myanmar [14].\nFor example: \u101e\u1030\u1010\u102f\u102d\u1094\u101e\u100a\u1039 \u1019\u108f \u1071\u1031\u101c\u1038\u1010\u103c\u1004\u1039 \u1048 \u101b\u1000\u1039 \u1010\u102d\u1010\u102d \u101c\u100a\u1039\u1001\u1032\u1037\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b\nStewart remarked that \"The Grammar of Burmese is almost entirely a matter of the correct use of particles\"(Stewart 1956: xi).

FUNCTION TAGGING", "text": ""}, {"heading": "8.1 Naive Bayes Classifier", "text": "Before one can build naive Bayesian based classifier, one needs to collect training data. The training data is a set of problem instances. Each instance consists of values for each of the defined features of the underlying model and the corresponding class, i.e. function tag in our case. The development of a Naive Bayes classifier involves learning how much each function tag should be trusted for the decisions it makes [17]. It is well-matched to the function tagging problem.\nThe Na\u00efve Bayesian classifier is a term in Bayesian statistics dealing with a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes\u2019 theorem with strong (na\u00efve) independence assumptions. It assumes independence among input features. Therefore, given an input vector, its target class can be found by choosing the one with the highest posterior probability. The probability model for a classifier is a conditional model.\nP (ck|x1, x2, \u2026 , xi) =P(ck)* P(x1,x2,\u2026,xi | ck) (1) Let X=x1, x2, x3, \u2026 (xi, i >=1 and X are features)\nC=c1, c2, c3, \u2026 (ck , k>=1 and C are classes) P (ck|x1, x2, \u2026 , xi) is referred to as the posterior probability P (ck) as the prior probability P(x1, x2,\u2026,xi|ck) as the log likelihood"}, {"heading": "8.2. Function Tagging by Using Na\u00efve Bayes Theory", "text": "The labels such as subject, object, time, etc. are named as function tags. By function, it is meant that action or state which a sentence describes. The system operates at word-level with the assumption that input sentences are pre-segmented, pos-tagged and chunked.\nEach proposed function tag is regarded as a class and the task is to find what class/tag a given word in a sentence belongs to a set of predefined classes/tags. A feature is a POS tag word with category. The category of a word is added to the POS tag to obtain more accurate lexical information. It can be formed from the features of that word.\nFor example: Ma Ma is a clever student.\nMa Ma [ \u1019\u1019(n.person) \u101e\u100a\u1039(ppm.subj) ] clever [ \u1005\u102c\u1031\u1010\u102c\u1039\u1031\u101e\u102c(adj.dem) ] student [\u1031\u1000\u103a\u102c\u1004\u1039\u1038\u101e\u1030(n.person)] a [ \u1010\u1005\u1039(part.number) \u1031\u101a\u102c\u1000\u1039(part.type) ] is [ \u103b\u1016\u1005\u1039(v.common) \u101e\u100a\u1039 (sf.declarative) ]\nNoun has 16 categories such as animals, person, objects, food, location, etc. There are 47 categories in our corpus. We show some features of Myanmar words as shown in table 4.\nIn Myanmar language, some words have same meaning but in different features as shown in table 5. For example:\n\u2022 Ma Ma and Hla Hla are friends. \u2022 He lives with his uncle. \u2022 He hits the dog with the stick.\nIn these three sentences, English words (and, with, with) have the same Myanmar meaning (\u108f\u103d\u1004\u1037\u1039).\nA class is a one of the proposed function tags. Same word may have different function tags as shown in table 6.\nThere are many chunks in a sentence such as NC (noun chunk), PPC (postpositional chunk), AC (adjectival chunk), RC (adverbial chunk), CC (conjunctional chunk), SFC (sentence\u2019s final chunk) and VC (verb chunk). The chunk types are shown in table 7.\nA chunk contains a Myanmar head word and its modifier. It can contain more than one POS tag and one of the POS tags is selected with respect to the chunk type. In the following chunk, the POS tag (n.animals) is selected with respect to the chunk type (NC).\nFor example: NC [\u1031\u1001\u103c\u1038/n.animals,\u1010\u1005\u1039/part.number,\u1031\u1000\u102c\u1004\u1039/part.type]\nIf the noun chunk (NC) contains more than one noun, the last noun (n.food) is selected as a main word according to the nature of Myanmar language.\nFor example: NC [\u1031\u1006\u102c\u1004\u1039\u1038\u101b\u102c\u101e\u102e/n.time,\u101e\u102e\u1038\u108f\u1036\u103d\u1015\u1004\u1039/n.food,\u1019\u103a\u102c\u1038/part.number]\nThere are many possible function tags (t1, t2\u2026tk) for each POS tag with category (pc). These possible tags are retrieved from the training corpus by using the following equation that is prior probability as shown in Table 8.\nP (tk|pc) = C (tk,pc)/C(pc) (2)\nObj:0.0299, PCom:0.0149 pron.possessive PIobj:0.1111, PSubj:0.2222, PObj:0.6667 cc.chunk CCC:1.0 adj.dem PcomplS:0.0192, Ada:0.9808 n.animal Subj:0.1212, PObj:0.3333, PcomplS:0.1212, PSubj:0.2727, PSim:0.0606, Obj:0.0303, PAim:0.0303, PUse:0.0303 v.common Active:1.0 part.eg PcomplOP:0.5455, SimP:0.4545\nWe calculate the probability between next function tags (n1, n2\u2026nj) and previous possible tags by using the following equation that is log likelihood as shown in Table 9.\nP (nj|tk) = C (nj,tk)/C(tk) (3)\nPossible function tags are disambiguated by using Na\u00efve Bayesian method. We multiply the probabilities from (2) and (3) and choose the function tag with the largest number as the posterior probability.\nTechnically, the task of function tags assignment is to generate a sentence that has correct function tags attached to certain words.\nOur description of the function tagging process refers to the example as shown in figure 3, which illustrates the sentence (\u201c\u1019\u1019\u108f\u103d\u1004\u1037\u1039\u101c\u103d\u101c\u103d\u101e\u100a\u1039 \u1031\u1000\u103a\u102c\u1004\u1039\u1038\u101e\u102f\u102d\u1094 \u1005\u1000\u1039\u1018\u102e\u1038\u103b\u1016\u1004\u1037\u1039 \u101e\u103c\u102c\u1038\u101e\u100a\u1039\u104b\u201d (Ma Ma and Hla Hla go to school by bicycle).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "In our corpus, all sentences can be further classified as two sets. One is simple sentence set, in which every sentence has no more than 15 words. The other is complex sentence set, in which every sentence has more than 15 words. There are 1600 simple sentences and 2300 complex sentences in the corpus.\nFor evaluation purpose, different numbers of sentences collecting from Myanmar textbooks of middle school and Myanmar historical books are used as a test set. There are about 2200 sentences in the test set. After implementation of the system using the grammar, it has been seen that the system can easily generates the parse tree for a sentence if the sentence structure satisfies the grammar rules. Our program tests only the sentence structure according to the\ngrammar rules. So if the sentence structure satisfies the grammar rule, program recognizes the sentence as a correct sentence and generates a parse tree. Otherwise it gives output as an error. Table 10 shows the overall performance for the proposed system. The proposed system yield 96.68% of precision, 93.05% of recall and 94.83% of f-measure for simple sentence. Performance comparisons between the various sentence types are shown in figure 8."}, {"heading": "11. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In the task of assigning function tag, we chose Na\u00efve Bayes model for its simplicity and user-friendliness. We apply context-free grammar for parsing because it is easier to maintain and can add new language features. The parse tree can be built by using\nfunction tags. As function tagging is a pre-processing step for parsing, the errors occurred in the task of function tagging affect the parse tree. The corpus may be balanced because Na\u00efve Bayesian framework probability simply describes uncertainty. The corpus creation is time consuming. The corpus is the resource for the development of Myanmar to English translation system and we expect the corpus to be continually expanded in the future because the tested sentence can be added into the corpus. In this work we have considered limited number of Myanmar sentences to construct the grammar rules. In future work we have to consider as many sentences as we can and some more tags for constructing the grammar rules because Myanmar language is a free-phrase-order language. Word position for one sentence may not be same in the other sentences. So we can not restrict the grammar rules for some limited number of sentences."}], "references": [{"title": "Function tagging", "author": ["D Blaheta"], "venue": "Ph.D. Dissertation,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Assigning automatically Part-of-Speech tags to build tagged corpus for Myanmar language", "author": ["Phyu Hnin Myint"], "venue": "The Fifth Conference on Parallel Soft Computing,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Chunk Tagged Corpus Creation for Myanmar Language", "author": ["Phyu Hnin Myint"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the ninth International Conference on Computer Applications,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Statistical parsing with a context-free grammar and word statistics", "author": ["Eugene Charniak"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Fourteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 1997}, {"title": "Assigning function tags to parsed text", "author": ["D.

In the task of function tagging, we use the functional annotated corpus and tag Myanmar sentences with correct segmentation, POS (part-of-speech) tagging and chunking information.
