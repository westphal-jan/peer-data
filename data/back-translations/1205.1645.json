INTRODUCTION", "text": "This project to build a framework for publishing and interlinking transport data on the Web was developed in collaboration between LIRMM1, Universit\u00e9 Montpellier 22 and CETE3 M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. The feasibility of publishing and interconnecting transport transport into linked data on the web will be studied concretely from two data sources: the directory information services Passim and XML files corresponding to the NEPTUNE format describing public transport routes. Open Data, in France, has been booming for the last 2 years. Open Data is the publication of public data, free of charge and in open formats so that people who want to use them can do it. This phenomenon is closely linked with the term Linked Data. It refers to a set of best practices for publishing and interlinking structured data on the Web. These best practices were introduced by Tim BernersLee and have become known as the Linked Data principles. These principles are 1) use URIs as names for things, 2) use URIs which are dereferenceable, 3) use RDF and SPARQL standards, 4) link URIs between them. So if all data is linked, a huge graph is created, which forms the Web of data (or Semantic Web). The Semantic Web, term introduced by Tim Berners-Lee [1], aims at putting data on the Web in a form that machines can naturally understand, so web content can be treated directly or indirectly by machines. This is done with the help of ontologies. An ontology, according to Tom Gruber [2] is the specification of a conceptualization. A conceptualization is an abstract and simplified view of the world that we want to represent.

It identifies and provides a list of information services on French passenger transport and other mobility services. Its content is managed by the CETE M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. In practice, the directory is a website which retrieves the relevant services for a city or territory in France, distinguishing between modes or types of transport (car, transit, etc.) and perimeter (urban, departmental, and regional). Services are at least web sites, sometimes including phone services, or mobile applications (in the future it could also be Web services). The directory contains freely reusable data (now published in the open data portal of the French government [4]). This directory could be extended for example with references to other datasets. Its format is published in CSV5 and is represented as follows (translated): Sheet number;Service Name;Coverage service;Region;Department;City;Modes of transport;Type of service;Network accessibility for disabled person;Land informations;Website;Website accessibility for disabled person;Information points ;Remark;Comments;Sms;Mobile application;List of cities covered (Postal code);Sheet created;Sheet modified\nEach column is separated by the character ';'.

NEPTUNE profile is fully compatible with the CHOUETTE software whose development is supported by the Ministry of Transport8. NEPTUNE will evolve in the context of works within the European standardization of the Netex9 project. It should be noted that Google has specified an exchange text format, GTFS, which is the standard for publishing transport data into open data (mainly North American networks). The first NEPTUNE open data were published by the General Council of Gironde10, others will follow (the General Council of Is\u00e8re and the Saone et Loire).

RELATED WORK", "text": "In this section we will cover related work in transport data and formats, and data publication processes."}, {"heading": "2.1 Open transport data", "text": "For the following reasons, transport data publication is popular in the UK:\n\u2022 They are the pioneers of open data in Europe (culture of public transparency, Crown Copyright, etc.).\n\u2022 The public transport sector has benefited from a decade of heavy investment in data standardization (Transport Direct project, standard NAPTAN, NPTG, TransXchange, etc.)13.\nA very good example of what can be done is posted on the United Kingdom open data website14. A lot of UK public transport data is on the Web, but little is available as linked data. Only a few datasets conform to Semantic Web standards have been identified: 1) the national repository of UK bus stops\n12 http://www.datalift.org 13 http://www.dft.gov.uk/public-transportdatastandards/ 14 http://data.gov.uk\n(NAPTAN), 2) the Bus timetable of Manchester15, 3) Maps of roads, railway stations and airport in the UK16. For a better understanding, a package containing all the linked data published by the Government of the United Kingdom is available online17. Despite the large number of U.S. transit systems whose tender is published in open data, their translation into linked data has only been the result of a few attempts and seems less advanced than in the United Kingdom. Other data should follow, including all public transport timetables in the UK this year. There is also another ontology concerning transport, \"The Tickets Ontology\"18. In France, for the past two years, there is a strong interest for publishing public transport data as open data. For now, only three networks are online: Rennes, Nantes and Bordeaux. But with the ever-increasing number of data on the French open data portal there will certainly be more very quickly. From these data published in standard formats (NEPTUNE or GTFS), the technical work necessary to ensure their publication and their interlinking as linked data on the Web should not be too complex once the framework defined in this article will be completed."}, {"heading": "2.2 Data publication process", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.2.1 Selection or creation of an ontology", "text": "The following tools are used for the selection of ontologies.

The Data Tank24: is a framework for publishing data in a RESTful way and easing the task of creating an application and allowing the publication and display of data in CSV, XLS and SHP (Shapefile). However it does not take the XML format, it does not publish data by using an ontology and does not makes interconnection. LDIF [17]: is a framework for retrieving all the data of interest from several sources and unifying them with a vocabulary by creating a custom URI and when we request this URI that affects multiple datasets simultaneously.

Data publication workflow", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Selection or creation of an ontology", "text": "To take advantage of the semantics, we must model information, and for this, we rely on one or many ontologies. If the data is in a domain where there are already well-known ontologies, they are used. Otherwise, we have to create a new ontology, hoping it will be reused by others. Once the ontology created it must be published. Standards for writing ontologies are OWL [18] and RDF Schema [19]. RDF Schema provides basic elements for defining vocabularies or ontologies intended to structure RDF resources [20]: the main RDFS components are integrated into a more expressive (but more complex) ontology language, OWL."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Passim case", "text": "Concerning Passim there is no ontology that could have been specialized in this field: information transport.

Although these English data formats are \"cousins\" of the NEPTUNE format, there will be undoubtedly links between vocabularies to do, there were not yet adapted to the NEPTUNE representation, so it was necessary, like for Passim, to develop an ontology for NEPTUNE31. Over time (from late 2012 at best), the European standard, Netex (under development) should unify the vocabulary and formats for data exchange in Europe for public transport data. At short term, we cannot link the NEPTUNE data with other Semantic Web data except via the geographic coordinates of stops; our vocabulary seems to diverge somewhat from existing ontologies despite a few similarities, like stops and roads. This ontology can therefore represent all data that may contain the original XML file (stop, route, schedule, etc.). It was particularly connected with the FOAF ontology and INSEE. The NEPTUNE ontology contains 50 classes and 125 properties."}, {"heading": "3.2 Conversion to RDF", "text": "To make a particular dataset usable, we must publish in in a form allowing to know that the data is related to concepts defined in an ontology.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Public transport data can be used in countless professional and consumer applications as the data is published and reused, or as web services are available online. For example, a real-time map of all vehicles (trains, subways, buses, trams, taxis) of a city gives the user an overall view and possible delays: this application already exist (Swiss trains41), without needing Linked Data. With this workflow we can develop applications using multiple datasets simultaneously. For example, it will be possible to use generic tools and well-formulated queries, to display restaurants and other activities available around each transit stop (with, if it's a cinema, movie times, if it is a restaurant, the menus and specialties, etc.), or to find tourist transportation routes based on destination and interests of the user. We can also make small fun requests, for example, to know how many stops in France are called \"Victor Hugo\" or how many\n41 http://swisstrains.ch\nstops are called after a French writer, and among these stops, which ones are located in a street that bears the same name."}, {"heading": "6.
