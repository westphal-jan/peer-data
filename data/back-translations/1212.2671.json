INTRODUCTION The success of eolian resource forecasting depends on precision. Indeed minimizing error implies to consider factors such as: the selected forecasting model, the model parameters, the available data history, etc. Fuzzy logic and neural networks are frequently employed for estimating and forecasting [1] when available data is not sufficiently reliable because it allows tolerance levels due to the imprecision associated with linguistic terminology, which, by their very nature, are less precise than numbers. Fuzzy logic is a useful technique because it makes use of uncertainty and calibrates vagueness to find robust solutions at low computational cost [2]. Furthermore, because they are inspired by and adapted from biological systems, artificial neuronal network models simulate the cognitive processes in so much as they possess the capacity to interpret the world in the same way human beings do. Each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages. A number of studies have reported successful results from the application of neural networks to wind velocity forecasts. For example, in 2009 [3] Monfared et al.\napplied a strategy based on fuzzy logic and neuronal networks to forecast wind velocity. They employed statistical properties such as standard deviation, mean, and variable calculation relation gradient as neuro-fuzzy predictor model input. They did so by using real time data obtained in northern Iran from 2002 to 2005. Readings were taken at average intervals of 30 minutes. In 2009 in average Cadenas et al. used one hour intervals to forecast wind velocity by using data collected by the Federal Commission of Electricity (Comision Federal de Electricidad, CFE) during a period of seven years in the La Venta, Oaxaca, Mexico [4]. This was done using a backpropagation and Madaline neuronal network with a mean square error measured at 0.0039 during the training process. In another study, Adbel Aal, et al. [5] performed wind velocity forecasts by using tardy neuronal networks (TTND), particularly for the maintenance of wind farms where researchers used a wind velocity data base with one-hour intervals compiled in the Dhahran region of Saudi Arabia from 1994 to 2005. The proposed model was evaluated with data from May of 2006, and the forecasting time was from 16 to 24 hours. Therefore, the network precision measurement parameter had a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 m/s, and the correlation coefficient was equal to 0.83 between the actual value and the forecast. In 2009 [6] Sancho Salcedo, et al. employed a multilayered network with the Levenberg-Marquadt training method in which the input variables were wind velocity chosen at two points of interest with wind direction at one point, temperature at one point, and solar radiation at two points. Hence, there are six values in the input layer, a hidden layer with six neurons with a sigmoidal logarithmic activation function, and an output layer with one neuron. The forecasting time was 48 hours. The data had been collected since 2006 in Albacete province in southern Spain. The goal of this study is to perform a comparative on the performance of an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) in forecasting time intervals of 16, 24, and 48 hours.

In the e results em, data recasts.\nEach model made forecasts within periods of 16, 24 and 48 forward hours. This involved wind velocity, barometric pressure, temperature and date as variables. With regard to the forecast periods, one can conclude that error increase as the forecast period increases. Training with the first model, which had 17,320 data samples, for a 16 hours forward forecast produced D=1, \u0394=1 y P=100 since 100*10=1000, and 1000/60=16 hours, producing r=81.1185. Subsequently, training with a second model with 17,273 data samples was performed for a 24 hours forward forecast period, producing D=1, \u0394=1 and P=144, since 144*10=1440, and 1440/60=24 hours producing r=80.8011 with a difference of 0.3174. Later training was performed with a model containing 17,132 data samples for a 48 hours forward forecast that produced D=1, \u0394=1 y P=288, since 288*10=2880, and 2880/60=48 hours producing r=77.0955 and an incremental difference of 4.023. It is worth mentioning that the three models were trained within six epochs. The training time was less for a hybrid like ANFIS than for a neuronal network. It is necessary to add that for future work, the utilization of other variables such as solar radiation, humidity, wind direction, etc., has not been discarded. The better performance of ANFIS with regard to the other intelligent methods is due to the combination of FL and ANN. Both mentioned membership functions (Bell and Gaussian) have been tested. It is important to mention that the rules used are generally based on the model and variables which depend on user\u2019s experience and trial and error methods. Furthermore, the shape of membership functions depends on parameters, and changing these parameters will change the shape of the membership function. These problems are also seen in neural networks. Most of their parameters in a neural network are selected by trial and error method and most of them are dependent on the user\u2019s experience.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank to the PROMEP project 103.5/11/5266, UNISTMO-PTC-056 for providing financial support.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Application of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System for Grade Estimation; Case Study, Sarcheshmeh Porphyry Copper Deposit, Kerman, Iran.

The data bank was provided by the meteorological station located at the University of Isthmus, Tehuantepec campus, and this data bank covers the period from 2008 to 2011. Three data models were constructed to carry out 16, 24 and 48 hours forecasts using the following variables: wind velocity, temperature, barometric pressure, and date. The performance measure for the three models is the mean standard error (MSE). In this work, performance analysis in short-term prediction is presented, because it is essential in order to define an adequate wind speed model for eolian parks, where a right planning provide economic benefits.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
