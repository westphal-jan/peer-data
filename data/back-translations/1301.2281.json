An n-player game is given by an undirected graph for n-nodes and a set of n-local matrices. Interpretation is that the payout to player i is entirely determined by the actions of player i and his neighbors in the graph, and therefore the payout matrix for player i is indexed only by these players. We therefore consider the global n-player game to be composed of interacting local games, with each game involving far fewer players. Each player's action may have a global impact, but it happens through the spread of local influences. Our most important technical result is an efficient algorithm for calculating Nash balances when the underlying graph is a tree (or can be turned into a tree with few node-mings).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:24:24 GMT  (1203kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2281v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"], ["v2", "Sun, 8 Mar 2015 01:31:51 GMT  (154kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2281v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["michael kearns", "michael l littman", "satinder singh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2281"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2281.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Graphical Models for Game Theory", "authors": ["Michael Kearns", "Michael L.
