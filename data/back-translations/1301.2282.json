The inclusion problem is how to characterize (graphically speaking) whether all statements of independence in the model induced by a DAG K are included in the model that was induced by a second DAG L. Meek (1997) to assume that this inclusion applies when there is a sequence of DAGs from L to K, so that only certain \"legal\" arrow reversal and \"legal\" arrow charging operations are performed to obtain the next DAG in the sequence. In this paper, we give several characterizations of the inclusion of DAG models and verify Meek's assumption in the event that the DAGs K and L differ in at most one adaptation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:24:28 GMT  (1017kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2282v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tomas kocka", "remco r bouckaert", "milan studeny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2282"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2282.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On characterizing Inclusion of Bayesian Networks", "authors": ["Tomas Kocka", "Remco R.
