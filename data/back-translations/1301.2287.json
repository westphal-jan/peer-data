Multi-entity Bayesque networks (MEBNs) are defined as representations of knowledge in domains characterized by uncertainty in the number of relevant units, their interrelations, and their association with the observable. A Bayesque network implicitly defines a probability distribution in the form of a hierarchically structured collection of Bayesque network fragments that together encode a common probability distribution across any number of interrelated hypotheses. Although a finite query complete model can always be constructed, association uncertainty typically renders the exact model construction and evaluation insoluble. The goal of hypotheses management is to balance traceability against accuracy. We describe an application to the problem of using news reports to divert the organization and activities of military vehicles from our approach to traceability.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:24:50 GMT  (1273kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2287v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kathryn blackmond laskey", "suzanne m mahoney", "ed wright"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2287"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2287.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Hypothesis Management in Situation-Specific Network Construction", "authors": ["Kathryn Blackmond Laskey"], "emails": ["klaskey@gmu.edu", "suzanne@iet.com", "ewright@iet.com"], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "Object Oriented Bayesian Networks: A Framework for Topdown Specification of Large Bayesian Networks and Repetitive Structures, Hewlitt Packard Laboratory for Normative Systems, Aalborg University, CIT-87.2-00-obphwl", "author": ["Bangse", "P.

Multi-entity Bayesian networks (MEBNs) are defined as a representation for knowledge in domains characterized by uncertainty in the number of relevant entities, their interrelationships, and their association with observables. An MEBN implicitly specifies a probability distribution in terms of a hierarchically structured collection of Bayesian network fragments that together encode a joint probability distribution over arbitrarily many interrelated hypotheses. Although a finite query-complete model can always be constructed, association uncertainty typically makes exact model construction and evaluation intractable. The objective of hypothesis management is to balance tractability against accuracy. We describe an approach to hypothesis management, present an application to the problem of military situation awareness, and compare our approach to related work in the tracking and fusion literature.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
