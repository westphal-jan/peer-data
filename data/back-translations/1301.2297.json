We present a case study on constructing a BN in an intelligent tutoring application, especially decimal misunderstandings. We describe the BN construction using expert surveys, and then examine how certain pre-existing automated methods of knowledge gathering could support the BN knowledge engineering process.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:25:34 GMT  (1123kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2297v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ann nicholson", "tal boneh", "tim wilkin", "kaye stacey", "liz sonenberg", "vicki steinle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2297"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2297.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Case Study in Knowledge Discovery and Elicitation in an Intelligent Tutoring Application", "authors": ["Ann Nicholson", "Tal Bonehf", "Tim Wilkinf", "Kaye Stacey", "Liz Sonenberg", "Vicki Steinlell"], "emails": [], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "Most successful Bayesian network (BN) ap\u00ad plications to date have been built through knowledge elicitation from experts.
