A graphical model is developed that represents the simultaneous development of tempo and rhythm and relates these hidden quantities to observations. Rhythm variables are discrete and tempo and observation variables are continuous. We show how the most likely configuration of tempo and rhythm variables in the world can be calculated taking note placement times into account. Pre-experiments are presented on the basis of a small data set. A generalization to any conditional Gaussian distributions is outlined.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:12 GMT  (1287kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2306v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SD", "authors": ["christopher s raphael"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2306"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2306.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Mixed Graphical Model for Rhythmic Parsing", "authors": ["Christopher Raphael"], "emails": ["raphael@math.umass.edu"], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "A method is presented for the rhythmic pars\u00ad<lb>ing problem: Given a sequence of observed<lb>musical note onset times, we simultaneously<lb>estimate the corresponding notated rhythm<lb>and tempo process.
