In many situations, these parameters themselves are random variables - this may reflect the uncertainty of the domain expert or originate from an atraining sample used to estimate the parameter values. Distribution over this \"CPtable variable\" induces a distribution over the response that returns the BN to some \"What is Pr (H | E)?\" query. This paper examines the deviation of this response and first shows that it is asymptotically normal, and then returns its mean and asymptotic variance. Then we present an effective general algorithm for calculating these are the effective ones (i.e. the mean values).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:44 GMT  (988kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2313v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tim van allen", "russell greiner", "peter hooper"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2313"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2313.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Bayesian Error-Bars for Belief Net Inference", "authors": ["Tim Van Allen", "Russell Greiner", "Peter Hooper"], "emails": ["timv@digimine.com", "greiner@cs.ualberta.ca", "hooper@stat.ualberta.ca"], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "A note on uniform asymptotic nor\u00ad mality of Dirichlet distribution", "author": ["Y.

In many situa\u00ad tions, the parameters are themselves treated as random variablesreflecting the uncertainty re\u00ad maining after drawing on knowledge of domain experts and/or observing data generated by the network. A distribution over the CPtable param\u00ad eters induces a distribution for the response the BN will return to any \"What is Pr{ H I E} ?\" query. This paper investigates the distribution of this response, shows that it is asymptotically normal, and derives expressions for its mean and asymptotic variance. We show that this compu\u00ad tation has the same complexity as simply com\u00ad puting the (mean value of the) response -i.e., O(n exp(w)), where n is the number of vari\u00ad ables and w is the effective tree width. We also provide empirical evidence showing that the error-bars computed from our estimates are fairly accurate in practice, over a wide range of belief net structures and queries.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
