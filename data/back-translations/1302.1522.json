A particular algorithm, structured policy construction, achieves this by means of a decision-theoretical analogy to target regression using action descriptions based on Bayesian networks with tree-structured conditional probability tables. The presented algorithm is not able to deal with actions with correlated effects. We describe a new decision-theoretical regression operator that corrects this weakness.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:53:51 GMT  (1133kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1522v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["craig boutilier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1522"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1522.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Correlated Action Effects in Decision Theoretic Regression", "authors": ["Craig Boutilier"], "emails": ["cebly@cs.ubc.ca"], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "Much recent research in decision theoretic plan\u00ad ning has adopted Markov decision processes (MOPs) as the model of choice, and has at\u00ad tempted to make their solution more tractable by exploiting problem structure.
