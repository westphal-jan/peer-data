It is studied how to carry out computations with both representations in an efficient way. The particular cases of finite sets and convex polytopes are considered.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nValuation Based Systems (VBS) were introduced by Shafer and Shenoy (Shafer and Shenoy 1988, Shafer 1991). This abstract framework to represent and calculate with valuations has been applied to differ ent formalisms, such as Probability, Belief Functions (Shenoy and Shafer 1990), Convex Sets of Probabilities (Cano, Moral and Verdegay Lopez 1993), Possibility Theory (Shenoy 1992), or Propositional Information Systems (Kohlas and Moral 1996).\nIn this paper, we study Valuation Based Systems in which an idempotent property is verified. This prop erty allows to define a partial order in the set of valu ations, which provides two methodologies to represent valuations: as infimum of very informative valuations and as supremum of very low informative ones.\nTwo particular cases are given to illustrate the theor etical developments: finite sets and convex sets of real numbers. It is shown as the general methods to rep resent valuations gives rise to the most common used techniques. For example, in the case of convex sets one corresponds to the representation by half-spaces and the other to the representation by extreme points.\nIn the computation part, each one of the basic opera tions \ufffdmarginalization and combination\ufffd is very easy in one of the representations and difficult in the other. We concentrate in general results allowing to speed up the computations in the difficult cases.\nIn classical algorithms for valuations, the complexity of the computations is directly related to the size of the frame in which they are defined. With idempotent valuations it will be possible to handle valuations on a frame, with a complexity much lower than its size.\nKohlas and Stark ( 1996) have introduced the concept of information algebra, which coincides essentially with an idempotent valuation system. They also define the associated order relation and show some of its proper ties. However, the focus of the paper is somewhat dif ferent. They presents this model as a general theory of information processing in computer science show ing the relationships with Scott's information systems (Scott 1982) and tuple systems.\nThe paper is structured in the following way: Section 2 studies the basic of idempotent valuations. Section 3 considers the strategies for representing valuations. Section 4 is devoted to procedures for computing with valuations. Finally, the conclusions are in Section 5.\n2 IDEMPOTENT VALUATION SYSTEMS\nAssume that we have an n-dimensional variable X = (X1, .. . , Xn) where each variable X; will take values on a set !J; = !Jx,. In these conditions, we will use the following notation:\n\u2022 If I\ufffd N = {1,2, . . . ,n} then X1 is the vector of variables (X;)iEl defined on 01 = X;Ef!J;. !JN is !:1{1, ,n}\u00b7\n\u2022 If x E !J1 and J \ufffd I then xP is the element of !JJ obtained from x but dropping the indexes of I - J. That is, xf = x;, ViE J.\n230 Hernandez and Moral\nValuation Based Systems (VBS's) were introduced by Shafer and Shenoy (1988,1990). It is assumed the ex istence of a disjoint set V1 for each I \ufffd { 1, . . . , n}. The elements of VI are called valuations on !:21, and rep resent the different pieces of information we may have about X[. The set of all the valuations, u/C{l, ... ,n} VI, will be denoted as V. -\nFor each valuation, V, s (V) will denote the subset I, such that V E VI.\nThere are two basic operations in valuation based sys tems (Shafer and Shenoy 1988, Shenoy and Shafer 1990):\n\u2022 Combination.- It is a mapping 0 : V x V -+ V such that s (V1 0 Vz) = s(VI) U s(V2) .\n\u2022 Marginalization.- Given J \ufffd I and V E VI, then the marginalization of V to J is a valuation V J.J E VJ.\nShenoy and Shafer (1988, 1990) consider the following axioms for these operations:\nAxiom 1. V1 0 V2 = V2 0 V1, (V1 0 V2) 0 V3 = V1 0 (V2 0 Vs)\nAxiom 2. If I\ufffd J \ufffd J{ and V E VK, then (V.P)-1.1 = V.i.I.\nAxiom 3. If V1 E VI, V2 E VJ, then (V1 0 V2).j. / =\nvl 0 v2 .j.(Jn/) 0\nAdditionally, Cano, Delgado and Moral (1993) intro duced the following two axioms, which will be also as sumed for general VBS's.\nAxiom 4. Neutral Element.- There is one and only one valuation Vo, defined on nl X 0 0 0 X nn, such that V'V E V1, V0.j.I 0 V = V.\nAxiom 5. Contradiction.- There is one and only one valuation Vc, defined on nl X . 0 0 X nn, such that V'V E V, V, 0 V = Vc.\nAn idempotent VBS is defined as a general VBS veri fying the following axiom:\nAxiom 6. VV E VJ, V'I \ufffd J, V-1.1 0 V = V\nProposition 1 If V is an idempotent VBS and V E V, such that s(V) = I , then V-1.1 = V.\nV.j.I = (V 0 V)-1.1 = V 0 vJ.I = V\nExample 1 Let a valuation on S11 be a subset of QI. That is, VI = 2nr 0 The combination of vl E VI, v2 E V J is defined as\nThe marginalization of V E VI to J \ufffd I is given by\nvJ.J = {xJ.J : X E V} (2)\nIt is immediate to show that this is an idempotent VBS. The neutral valuation is nl X .. . X nn and the contradiction is the empty subset in !J1 X ... X !:ln.\nExample 2 Consider that each set !:l; is the set of real numbers, IR;. A valuation on lRI is a convex set of points from !RJ, i.e. a subset V \ufffd lRI such that if x, y E V, and a E [0, 1], then ax+ (1- a)y E V.\nThe combination of V1 E lRI, V2 E lRJ is defined as\nThe marginalization of V E lRI to J \ufffd I is given by\nv.j.J = { x.j.J : X E V} (4)\nIt is immediate to show that this is an idempotent VBS. Definitions are quite similar to the example above, but as we shall show later in the paper, there are meaningful differences between these two systems.\nBelow we define a partial order relation in idempotent VBS's, which is very useful to study them.\nDefinition 1 We will say that V1 is less informative than V2 {V1 \ufffd V2), iff Vt 0 V2 = V2.\nExample 3 In both examples above (ordinary subsets and convex sets), vl \ufffd v2 if and only if v2 \ufffd vl.\nSome of the properties of the following proposition (2 and 5) have been also shown by Kohl as and Stark (1996).\nProposition 2 The relation \ufffd verifies the following properties:\n1. It is a (reflexive) partial order.\n2. If V1 E VI, V2 E VJ, V1 \ufffd V2, and K \ufffd J, then V.j.K -< V..j.K 1 - 2\n3. Sup V = Vc\n4. Inf V1 = V0.j. I\n5. V1 0 V2 =Sup {V11 V2}\n6. vP =Sup {V' E VJ V':::; V}\nProof\nPropertzes 1-5 are easily obtained from valu atwn axioms (including indempotence).\nTo show 6, consider V' E V J, such that V' :::; V, then following Axiom 3,\nvV \u00ae V' = (V \u00ae V')P (5)\nSince V' :i V, then V \u00ae V' = V, and we can write\nv.P \u00ae V' = vV (6)\nAs a consequence: V' :i vv and VP zs an upper bound of { V' E V J : V' :i V}. To prove that it is the supremum, consider that V\" E VJ is an upper bound of the set above. As vv :i V, then v.P :i V\", and therefore vV is the minimum of the upper bounds (the supremum).\nAs a consequence of property 5 above the supremum of 2 valuations always exists and it is equal to its com bination.\nDefinition 2 If V E Vr and I r; J, then the extension of v to J is defined as the valuation vt J = v @ vlJ.\nIt is immediate to verify that if V E Vr and J r; I then (VP)ti :i V. On the other hand, if I r; K then (VtK).j.I = V.\nDefinition 3 If V1 E Vr and V2 E V2, then V1 ttl V2 is equal to Inf {Vl, V2} = lnf {vtuJ, vFuJ} under :::5 relation.\nThere is no guarantee that V1 \\fl V2 exists for every pair of valuations.\nExample 4 In the example in which valuations are subsets from nl' vl ffi v2 always exists and it is equal to vltlUJ u v}IuJ. First, the two sets are extended to a common frame and then the union is calculated."}, {"heading": "In the case of convex sets, V1 \\fl V2 is the convex hull (the minimum convex set containing d) of the union", "text": "of the extensions: CH(VtuJ u V,fuJ).\nProposition 3 If V1 E Vr, V2 E V J are such that (Vl \\fl V2) exists, and K s;;; (I n J), then\n(7)\nInference with Idempotent Valuations 231\nWe have that V1.j.K :::; V1 and V2.j.K :5 v2. Thus, vl.j.K \\fl v2.j.K :i vl \\fl v2 and taking into account that (Vl \\fl V2 ).j.K := Sup {V : V E VK, V :::5 V1 \\fl V2}, we obtain that\n(8)\nOn the other hand, (V1 ffi V2) :::5 vtuJ and therefore (Vl \\fl V2).j.K :::5 (vltJuJ).j.K = vl.j. K . Analogously, we can obtain (V1 $ V2).J.K :;S V2.).K. As a consequence,\nAs the relation :::5 is antisymmetric, equatwns (8} and (9} proves the proposition.\nIn the following we define the combination of a pos sibly infinite set of valuations. As for finite sets the combination of all the valuations is the supremum (a consequence of property 5 in Proposition 2), then the following definition is consistent with the finite case.\nDefinition 4 Let H s;;; V, the combination of the valu ations in H, \u00ae H, is equal to\nSup {V : V E H} (10)\nWhen H is finite this supremum exists and it is the re peated combination of all the elements of H. However, in general, there is no guarantee that this supremum exists.\nDefinition 5 Let H r; V, the disjunction of the valu ations in H, ffi H, is equal to\nInf { vtr : V E H}\nwhere I= UveH s(H).\n(11)\nEB H is the infimum of the extension of the valuations in set H to a common frame.\nDefinition 6 An idempotent VBS is said to be com plete zj and only zj \u00ae H exzsts for every H s;;; V.\nProposition 4 If V is an idempotent and complete VBS then ffi H exists for every H s;;; V.\nProof\nIf H s;;; V, let I = UveH s(V) and LH the set of the lower bounds of the extensions of valuations in H to I, under \ufffd relation, i.e.,\n232 Hernandez and Moral\nLn = {V : V :::5 V'ti, VV' E H}. Ln is not empty, because V0\ufffd1 belongs always to it.\nAs V is complete Q9 Ln exists. Let us show that it is the infimum EB H. First, let us show that it is a lower bound. If V' E H, then VV E Ln, V :::5 V't1. So, (@Ln) \ufffd V't!. An then ( \u00ae H) is a lower bound of the ex tensions of valuations in H to Y.\nOn the other side, If V* is a lower bound of the extensions of valuations in H, then V* E Ln and therefore v\u2022 :::-; (@ Ln). So (\u00ae Ln) is the maximum of lower bounds, i.e., the supremum.\n3 REPRESENTATION SYSTEMS\nIn the following, we express a valuation as composi tion of simpler valuations. We assume that V is an idempotent VBS.\nDefinition 7 A subset V. C V will be called a lower representation system {LRS} iff VI, VQ.J.1 \u00a2 V., and\nVV E V1, 3H \ufffd V., such that V = \u00aeH\nwhere H is finite.\n(12)\nThat is, each valuation V can be expressed as a com bination of a finite set of valuations V' E V.. These valuations, V', are defined on frames s(V') \ufffd s(V).\nThe representation of a valuation in a lower represent ation system is not unique.\nDefinition 8 H \ufffd V. is said to be a minimal repres entation of V if and only if V = \u00ae H and if H' \ufffd H is such that V = \u00ae H', then H' =H.\nThe following proposition is immediate.\nProposition 5 H is minimal if and only if there is no V' E H such that(\u00ae H) = (@ H- {V'} ).\nIt is evident that V is a representation system because each valuation V can be expressed as a combination of itself: V = \u00ae{V}. But this will be a very useless one. We want represent valuations with simpler valu ations. This will be achieved with the so-called basic representations systems.\nDefinition 9 A set of valuations V.. is weakly tTl eluded in the set of valuations V., V \u2022\u2022 \ufffd V., iff\nDefinition 10 A basic lower representation system {BLRS) V. on V zs o lower representation system which verifies:\n,liV .. \ufffd V, representation system, such as V.,. \ufffd V. and V. =f V \u2022\u2022 (14)\nTheorem 1 If V. is o BLRS and H is a representa tion of V E V. then V E H.\nProof\nLet V E V., and H a representation of V in v.. If v \u00a2 H, let tJS consider v.. = v\u00b7 - { V} . Then V.. is a lower representation system: if a valuation V' has as representation H' in V., then if V \ufffd H', the same H' is a rep resentation of V' in V \u2022\u2022 . If V E H', then a representation of V' in V \u2022\u2022 can be obtained by considering H\" = ( H' - { V}) U H. It is also immediate to verify that V \u2022\u2022 \ufffd V., and this is in contradiction with the fact that V. is a basic lower representation system.\nTheorem 2 If V. is a BLRS and V ... is a LRS, then v. \ufffd v \u2022\u2022\nProof\nIf V E V., since V.. is a LRS, then there exists H \ufffd V \u2022\u2022 , such that V =\u00ae H. Now for each V' E H, let Hv, \ufffd V. be a representation of V' in BLRS V \u2022. If we consider H' == Uv'EH H V'\u00b7 Then, it is easy to show that H' is a representation of V in V., and by Theorem 1, we can deduce V E H'. Consider V' a valuation in H such that V E Hv\u2022.\nSince V' = (i!)Hv,, then V \ufffd V'.\nSince V = \u00ae H and V' E H, then V' :5 V. As the inclusion is anti-symmetrical we have that V = V' and as V' E V \u2022\u2022 , we have that V E V \u2022\u2022 .\nCorollary 1 It there exists a basic lower representa tion system in V, then it is unique.\nCorollary 2 If V. is a BLRS then\nV. = n {V \u2022\u2022 : V \u2022\u2022 is a LRS} ( 15)\nExample 5 For the VBS of subsets, and when ni is YV E V \u2022\u2022 3V' E V. verifying V \ufffd V' {i.e. V' = V\u00aeV') finite for every i E {1, . . . ,n}, a basic lower represent-\n( 13) ation system can be obtained by considering the least\ninformative subsets m each frame, nl' other than the neutral element. They are given by the complementary of one element X[ E nl: -.xf.\nA representation of a set A \ufffd fl1 can be given by the setH = {-..xi : XJ fl. A}, i.e., by enumerating all the elements not in A."}, {"heading": "In general, a valuation A \ufffd fl1 is more efficiently rep resented by using basic valuations on frames flJ, where", "text": "J C I . These valuations are more informative. As sume, for example, that fl; = {0, 1}, Vi= 1, . . . , n, and the subset given by:\nA= {x E nN : (xn = 1 \u00a2}X;= 1, Vi ::S n- 1)} (16)\nIf we use only valuations m nN to define this set, we need to list the 2n-l elements of the complementary of A. However, this set can be efficiently represented by valuations H = {V1, . . . , Vn-l,T}, where,\nVi=:-..(0,1)\ufffdfl;,n, i=1, ... ,n-1 (17)\nT:=-..(1, ... ,1,0)\ufffdflN (18)\nThe order of the representation is 0 ( n).\nIf we interpret the elements ofrl; as the true values of a propositional symbol p;, then a basic valuation cor responds to a clause. A clause as Pl V-..p2VP3 says that the assignation of true values: (0, 1, 0) is impossible. So it can be represented by -..(0, 1, 0) E n{1,2,3}. In general, the representation of a formula is obtained by expressing it in conjunctive normal form.\nExample 6 In the case of general convex sets in JR1, there is not a basic lower representation system. We have to make a restriction and to consider only poly hedral convex sets. In this case, a basic representation system is given by the set of all the half-spaces in each IR1 {a half-space is the portion of the space lying on one side of a hyperplane). Each basic valuation in JR1 is given by a linear restriction:\nL ax1.XI::Sf3 XfEfRt\n(19)\nIn this case, we do not obtain a great reduction by considering valuations defined on smaller frames. However, it is generally admitted that giving a poly hedral by a minimal set of half-spaces is an efficient representation.\nNow, we consider upper representation systems, in which a valuation is given by taking the infimum of\nInference with Idempotent Valuations 233\na finite set of valuations, i.e., we use more informat ive valuations to express a given valuation. Definitions and results are similar to the case of lower representa tion systems. So no proof of the results is given.\nDefinition 11 A subset V* \ufffd V will be called an upper representation system {URS) iff VI, V}1 ft. V*, and\nvv E VI' :::JH \ufffd v\u00b7 n VI' such that v = (f)H (20)\nwhere H is finite.\nThe set of all possible upper representation systems of V will be denoted by U RS(V).\nDefinition 12 H \ufffd V* is said to be a minimal rep resentation of V if and only if V = EB H and verifying that if H' \ufffd H is such that V = EB H', then H' = H .\nThe following proposition is immediate.\nProposition 6 H is minimal if and only if there is noV' E H such that (ffi H)= (ffi H- { V}).\nDefinition 13 A set of valuations V** weakly zn cludes the set of valuations V*, V** ;:;) V*, iff\nVV E V** 3W E V* verifying V' :j V (21)\nDefinition 14 A basic upper representation system {BURS) V* on V is an upper representation system which verifies:\n,BV** <;::; V, upper representation system, such as V** ;:;) V* and V* '# V**\n(22)\nTheorem 3 If V* is a BURS and H is a representa tion of V E V* then V E H.\nTheorem 4 If V* is a BURS and V** ls an URS, then v\u00b7 \ufffd v\u00b7\u00b7\nCorollary 3 It there exists a basic upper representa tion system in V, then it is unique.\nCorollary 4 If V* is a BURS then\nV* = n {V** : v\u2022\u2022 is an URS} (23)\nExampie 7 For the VBS oj subsets and being fl; fi nite for each i = 1, ... , n, and upper representation system can be obtained by considering the most inform ative valuations in each fl;: the elements, XI E flr. So, a set is represented by listing its elements.\nAgain, more efficiency is obtained if we consider basic sets in smaller frames flJ, J c I. Consider the same subset A of Example 5. This set may be represented by EB H'' where H' = {V{, . . . ' v\ufffd-1\u2022 T'} and\n234 Hernandez and Moral\nV;1 = (0, 0) \ufffd n{i,n}l i = 1, . . '1 n- 1\nT1 := (1, . . . , 1) \ufffd nN (24) (25)\nAgain the representation is 0 ( n) . Anyway, there are cases which can be efficiently represented in one of the basic systems (lower or upper) and not in the other, and cases which can not be efficiently represented in any of them.\nIf each n; is the set of true values of Pi I then a basic upper valuation is a conjunction of atomic formulas: 'Pl A 'P2 A P3 corresponds to the basic set (0, 0, 1) E n{1,2,3}. The representation of a general formula is obtained by expressing it in disjunctive normal form.\nExample 8 The most informative convex sets in IRr are the points: xr E IRr. However general convex sets, or even polyhedral, can not be represented as the convex hull (the infimum) of a finite set of points. We must do some additional restriction in the type of convex sets we want to consider. One possibility is to consider the polytopes in which each component x; E [0, 1], i.e., each convex set V E IRr, is included in the hypercube X;Ef[0,1] = [0, l]I, which is now the neutral element.\nHere, considering points in lower dimensions has little interest: there is not to much gam in efficiency. However, representing a convex set by its extreme points is considered as the alternative representation to use half-spaces {Preparata and Shamos 1985).\nThe transformation between both representations has achieved a great deal of attention in the field of Com putation Geometry. A survey of algorithms to find the extreme points from the half-spaces can be found in Mattheis and Rubin {1977). The half-spaces of a poly tope defined as a set of extreme points are calculated by applying the so-called convex hull algorithms {Pre parata and Shamos 1985).\n4 COMPUTING WITH REPRESENTATIONS\nIn general, the problem of reasoning with valuations can be stated in the following way: we have a finite set of valuations R = { V1, . . . , Vm}, where each V; is defined on a frame I;. We are interested in calculating (Shafer and Shenoy 1988):\n(26)\nfor a particular j E { 1, ... , n}.\nThis is done by the so-called deletion algorithm (Shafer and Shenoy 1988, Shenoy and Shafer 1990). This\nalgorithm proceeds by transforming the set R = { V1, . . . , V m} according to the following basic step (De leting index k):\n\u2022 Let k be an index, k # j. Consider I{ {V; E R : k E s(V;)} and L = s(@ K)- {k}. Transform R into the set\nR- K U {(0K)\ufffdL} (27)\nIn our case, as we want to use only basic valuations we replace K by a subset of basic valuations representing (0K)\ufffdL.\nThis step is repeated until all the valuations are defined on frame {j}. Then the solution, Rj, is represented by all the valuations in R.\nTo make notation more expressive, V\ufffd8(V)-{k} will be denoted as v-k. So (0K)\ufffdL will be expressed as (0K)-k.\nIn this section we study how this basic step can be carried out with valuations represented in a BLRS and in a BURS.\n4.1 USING A LOWER REPRESENTATION SYSTEM\nFirst, let us consider that each V; is given by \u00ae H;, where H; \ufffd V. and V. is a BLRS.\nIn this case the combination\u00ae K is very easy: \u00ae K = \u00ae HK, where HK = Uv,eK H;. That is, a represent ation of the combination of the valuations in K is ob tained by calculating the union of the representations of each one of the valuations in K.\nNext we have to calculate (\u00ae HK ) -k. This marginal ization is not immediate, but before doing it, it is con v\ufffd;:nient to remove from HK the subsumed valuations: a valuation V E H K is subsumed by V' E H K if and only if V j V1\u2022 It is clear that we can remove sub sumed valuations from H K without changing the res ult of the combination. Removing valuations can make future calculations more efficient.\nLet Hl< and H'{ be defined in the following way:\nHK = {V E HK k E s (V) } , H'{ = HK- Hl< (28)\nIt is clear that ,\n(29)\nSo basic valuations, H'{, which are not defined for the variable to delete, k, may be set aside and to consider\nonly valuations in H'x. Afterwards, H'k is added to the representation of (\u00aeH'x )-k. In general, to calculate (0H'x)-k it is not necessary to combine all the valuations in H'x before carrying out the marginalization. In most of the cases, it is enough to make simpler combinations. The basis to do it will be to try to verify the condition in the following definition.\nDefinition 15 In a BLRS V. the deletion of index k is of dimension l if and only if for every set H \ufffd V., such that k E s(V), VV E H, the following condition is verified:\n(\u00aeH)-k = {gl ({(\u00aeH')-k : H' \ufffd H, IH'I = l}) (30)\nwhere I H'l stands for the cardinal of H'.\nSo if the deletion of k is of dimension l, we have not to combine all the valuations in Hf<. We have to consider all the subsets, H', of Hf< with l elements and then to calculate (0H')-k. The representation of the margin alization is the union of the representations of all the sets (\u00aeH')-k. The efficiency of the resulting proced ure is based on using strategies to select only those subsets H' \ufffd H'x such that H'-k is not the neutral element.\nEach time we calculate new valuations in (0Hf< )-k, we can check whether there are valuations in H'x sub sumed by them: they can be removed from H'x, de creasing the number of future subsets H'.\nExample 9 In the VBS of subsets where each f.!; zs finite, the deletion of index k is of dimension lstk /. Assume that we have a set of basic valuations H = { -.x1, ... , -.xm} where each xi has index k. Then the deletion of k can be carried out in the following way:\n1. Determine the subsets H' \ufffd H, with IOk I ele ments and such that\n'r;f--.,xil' --.,x;2 E H', x\ufffd\ufffd # x\ufffd2 (31)\nInference with Idempotent Valuations 235\none with Pk and the other with -.pk and such that its resolution by Pk is not trivial {they do not have another pair of opposite literals). Step 2 does the resolution of the two clauses, resulting on a deletion of Pk. What it is done is an ordered resolution of all the clauses in H to find all the consequences not containing Pk (Kohlas and Moral 1996}. Above methodology is a generalization of resolution for arbitrary finite sets. Assume now that we have the set A of Example 5 represented by valuations {V1, ... , Vn-1, T} and that we have observed that p2 is false, i.e. the valu ation 02 given by -.( 1) <; 02. In order to calculate {A @ 02} H n}, the deletion algorithm proceeds as fol lows:\n- To delete k = 1, there are two basic valuations defined for this index: T and V1, where\nBy applying our deletwn procedure, these valu ations are removed and no new basic valuation is added to H.\n- Fork = 3, . . . 1 n- 1, we proceed by removing all valuations, vk' without adding new valuations,\n- For k = 2, we have the valuations 02 and V2. Its resolution produces as result -.(1) \ufffd On, i.e., -,Pn.\nIn this moment, with all the valuations defined in r.ln we stop and give the desired result: -.pn. The com plexity of the computations has been much more lower than the size of the frame nN. In fact, it has been or order O(n).\nExample 10 In the case of polyhedral in IR1, the de letion of index k is always of dimension 2. Assume that we have a subset H = { V1 1 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , Vn} where each Vi is a half-space in lRI; and k E I;. The deletion of\nIf -.xi1, -.xi2 E H', i E s(--.x;1) 11 s(--.xi2) then xi1 = xi2 and ( i =/=-k) index k can be done as follows. Let L; be the linear I I\n(32)\n2. For each one of these subsets H', let -.xH' the basic valuation defined on s(@H')-{k}, and given by xf' = x{, where -.xi E H'.\n(@H) -k is represented by the set of all the -.xH' ob  tained with rules above. When each 0; has the true values of a proposition Pi as elements, then Step 1 above, selects a pair of clauses:\nrestriction defining half-space v;,\nL. = \"'\"\"' \"'j X. < j3\u00b7 ' - LJ '-'i J- ' jEl;\n(33)\nLet \u00a3+ be the set of linear restrictions, L;, for which af > 0, c- be the set of restrictions for which af < 0, and \u00a30 the set of linear restrictions for which af = 0. For each pair L; E \u00a3+ and LJ E c- consider the restriction L;,j = -aj .L; + a\ufffd .Lj, which is given by\n236 Hernandez and Moral\nLet c-k = {L;,j : L; E [.+, Lj E c-} U \u00a30.\n(34)\nThen H-k is the valuation given by half-spaces defined by restrictions in c-k.\nBy analogy, we call the restriction L;,j, the resolution of L; and Lj. This method of calculating marginalization of convex sets is used in Preparata and Shamos (1985). We do not know how this simple technique compares with an other more complicated procedures such as quantifier elimination methods (Lassez and Lassez 1992).\n4.2 USING AN UPPER REPRESENTATION SYSTEM\nNow for each valuation, V;, there is a subset of basic upper valuations, H;, such that V; = E9 H;. By Pro position 3, the easy step in the calculation of (\u00ae K).!.L is the marginalization and the difficulty is in the com bination (@ K). To simplify this exposition, let us consider the case of combining two valuations, Vt and V2, given by sets, H1 and H2. The extension to a finite number of valuations is immediate.\nWe want to calculate:\n(35)\nNow a previous step is to remove from each H; the valuations subsuming another valuation in H;.\nThe basis of the computations will be to verify the following definition.\nDefinition 16 A set of basic upper valuations, H, is said to be of dimension l if and only if 'v'V E V*, if tBH:::; V, then there is a subset R s; H with IRI = l+l, and tBR:::; V.\nIf H1 and H2 are of dimensions lt and l2, then:\n(tBHI) 0 (EBH2) = EB{(tBR!) 0 (EBR2) : R; s; H;,IR;I = l;, i = 1,2}\n(36)\nThis is a kind of generalized distributive property which transform the problem in doing more combin ations but with much simpler valuations.\nExample 11 In the case of valuations which are finite subsets of 01, then every set H is of dimension 0. So\nwe obtain the distributive property:\n(ffiHI) 0 (EBH2l = EB{VI 0 v2 : V1 E H1, v2 E H2} (37)\nMore efficiency is obtamed when we only select non inconsistent valuations Vt and V2. Since a valuation is an element, V; = xI,, then this condition is verified when x;:\u2022ni, = x;\ufffd,nl,.\nIn the following we consider the case of higher dimen sions giving rise to non-distributive combinations. We assume that the representation, H, of a valuation, V, in a BURS is always minimal and homogeneous (all the valuations are defined in the same frame as V).\nDefinition 17 A valuation V' E V* is said to be in a [-dimensional face of minimal set of basic upper valu ations H if and only if there is a subset R s; H such that IRI = l + 1 and ffiR:::; V'.\nDefinition 18 V' E V* is said to be an extreme point of minimal set of basic upper valuations H if and only if V' is in a face of dimension 0.\nDefinition 19 V' is said to be interior to ffiH of di mension l, if and only if is not in a face of dimension l' < l of minimal set H.\nDefinition 20 0 is said to preserve interior points if and only if (V' interior to ( EBH 1) and to ( ffiH 2)) implies (V' interior to (ffiHt) 0 (EBH2)).\nDefinition 21 Given H1 and H2 set of basic upper valuations in V1, then the pair ( R1, R2) is said to be minimal consistent (MC) if and only if'\n1. Rt s; Ht, R2 s; H2.\n2. {EBRt) 0 (EBR2) # Vc.!.I\n3. If (Ri, R\ufffd) verifies 1} and 2) then R1 s; Ri and R2 s; R\ufffd.\nTheorem 5 If 0 preserves interior points, then\n(EBHI}0(EBH2) = ffi{(EBRI) 0 (EBR2) : (R1,R2) is MC} (38)\nProof\nLet (EBHt) 0 (ffiH2) = EB{VI, . . . , Vm} be a minimal representation of ( ffiH t) @ ( EBH 2). For each V;, let R{ (j = 1, 2) a minimal subset of Hj such that (EBR1 j V; )(j = 1, 2). V; is extreme of ( EBR[) 0 ( ffiRf) because it is extreme of (EBHt) 0 (EBH2) and\n(ffiHt) 0 (EBH2):::; (EBR;) 0 (EBR?)"}, {"heading": "V; is interior to (ffiRl) and (ffiRl), so it is interior to ( ffiRD 0 ( $Rl}.", "text": "As V; is interior and extreme of (ffiRJ) 0 ( $Rf), then the only possibility is that (ffiR}) 0 (ffiRf) = {V;}. And therefore ( ffiR}) 0 ( ffiRl) is minimal consistent.\nTheorem above allows to reduce the number and the size of the combinations.\nExample 12 When valuations are polyhedral in IR1, then the dimension of a valuation $H s; IR1 is I I minus the dimension of the smaller affine subspace containing ffiH."}, {"heading": "Of course intersection of polytopes preserves interior points and the combination can be carried out using", "text": "Theorem 5.\nThe efficiency of the resulting algorithm will depend of the efficiency in the determination of minimal consist ent pairs. We do not know any general algorithm based on this search. In fact, in the classical book by Pre parata and Shamos {1985), this problem (intersection of convex sets given by their extreme points) is only considered in dimensions 2 and 3, and the algorithms are based on quite sophisticated techniques.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have studied idempotent valuations proposing new algorithms to work with sets and polytopes in big frames. The methods of calculating are also applicable to other idempotent valuations systems such as Possib ility Theory (Dubois and Prade 1991, Shenoy 1992), or the Symbolic Theory of Evidence (Kohlas 1993).\nThe idea is to use to dual strategies to represent and calculate with valuations: as infimum of very inform ative valuations or supremum of very low informative ones. We do not think that working with basic repres entation systems is essential. We can use a non-basic representation system, but then more effort should be devoted to determine efficient ways of doing marginal ization or combination.\nA refinement of some of the resulting algorithms and comparison of them with another classical procedures is necessary in the future.\nReferences\nJ .E.
