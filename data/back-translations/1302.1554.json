However, in this paper we describe an object-oriented Bayesian network language (OOBN) that allows complex domains to be described with respect to interconnected objects. We use a Bayesian network fragment to describe the probabilistic relationships between the attributes of an object. These attributes can themselves be objects and provide a natural framework for encoding parts of hierarchies. Classes are used to provide a reusable probabilistic model that can be applied to several similar objects. Classes also support the inheritance of model fragments of a class to a subclass, allowing the common aspects of related classes to be defined only once. Our language has a clear declarative sequence: an OBabilistic object can be uniformly interpreted within an OBabilistic model as a structural element that can be used as such.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:57:36 GMT  (1425kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1554v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["daphne koller", "avi pfeffer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1554"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1554.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Object-Oriented Bayesian Networks", "authors": ["Daphne Koller"], "emails": ["koller@cs.stanford.edu", "@cs.stanford.edu"], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "Data model i ssues for object-oriented applications", "author": ["J.

They have been successfully applied in a variety of medium-scale applications. However, when faced with a large complex domain, the task of modeling using Bayesian networks begins to resemble the task of pro\u00ad gramming using logical circuits. In this paper, we de\u00ad scribe an object-oriented Bayesian network (OOBN) lan\u00ad guage, which allows complex domains to be described in terms of inter-related objects. We use a Bayesian net\u00ad work fragment to describe the probabilistic relations be\u00ad tween the attributes of an object. These attributes can themselves be objects, providing a natural framework for encoding part-of hierarchies. Classes are used to pro\u00ad vide a reusable probabilistic model which can be applied to multiple similar objects. Classes also support inher\u00ad itance of model fragments from a class to a subclass, allowing the common aspects of related classes to be defined only once. Our language has clear declarative semantics: an OOBN can be interpreted as a stochas\u00ad tic functional program, so that it uniquely specifies a probabilistic model. We provide an inference algorithm for OOBNs, and show that much of the structural infor\u00ad mation encoded by an OOBN-particularly the encap\u00ad sulation of variables within an object and the reuse of model fragments in different contexts--can also be used to speed up the inference process.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
