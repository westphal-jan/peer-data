In more complex areas, problem-specific models must be built from a knowledge base that encodes probabilistic relationships in the domain. Most work in knowledge-based model construction usually starts from the basic unit of knowledge. We present a knowledge representation framework that allows the knowledge bank designer to specify knowledge in larger semantically significant units, which we call network fragments. Our framework provides for the representation of asymmetric independence and canonical intercausal interaction. We discuss the combination of network fragments to form problem-specific models to think about specific problem cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:57:59 GMT  (723kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1557v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kathryn blackmond laskey", "suzanne m mahoney"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1557"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1557.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Network Fragments: Representing Knowledge for Constructing Probabilistic Models", "authors": ["Kathryn Blackmond Laskey"], "emails": ["klaskey@gmu.edu", "suzanne@iet.com"], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "Knowledge Representation and Inference in Intelligent Decision Systems", "author": ["Breese", "John S"], "venue": "Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Engineering-Economic Systems,", "citeRegEx": "Breese and S.,? \\Q1987\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Breese and S.", "year": 1987}, {"title": "Fast learning by bounding likelihoods in sigmoid-type belief networks", "author": ["T.
