Our main contribution is a technique we call relevance-based decomposition, which approaches faith actualization in large networks by focusing on its parts and splitting them into partially overlapping subnetworks, making thinking possible in some intractable networks and often leading to significant acceleration, as the total time required to update all subnetworks in practice is often significantly shorter than the time needed to update the network as a whole. We report on the results of empirical tests that demonstrate the practical importance of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:58:06 GMT  (1336kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1558v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yan lin", "marek j druzdzel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1558"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1558.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Computational Advantages of Relevance Reasoning in Bayesian Belief Networks", "authors": ["Yan Lin", "Marek J.
