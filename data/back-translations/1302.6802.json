Although the correct functioning of these systems depends practically on the existence of a small number of probability distributions, no formal justification has been proposed for why this should be the case. In this paper, we attempt to fill this obvious gap by examining asymmetries between the probabilities of different states of uncertain models. By rewriting the common probability distribution across the variables of a model into a product of the previous and conditional probability distributions of individual variables and adding the central limit theorem to this product, we can show that the probabilities of individual states of the model can be derived from highly distorted log-normal distributions. If there is sufficient asymmetry in individual preceding and conditional probability distributions, a small fraction of states can be expected to cover a large part of the total probability space, with virtually negligible probability states remaining.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:15:32 GMT  (993kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6802v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marek j druzdzel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6802"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6802.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Some Properties of Joint Probability Distributions", "authors": ["Marek J.
