Belief updating in presence of new evidence consists in the combination of the know l\ufffddge and the incoming evidence, and the marginaliza tiOn of this combination to each single variable.\nWhen the number of variables is high, the joint proba bility distribution cannot easily be given to complete the knowledge-base.\nTo avoid this problem, one solution is to split the who le set of variables into small subsets, give probability distributions among those subsets, and then combine these distributions.\nThe notion of independence between sets of variables can be used to achieve this process.\nConditional probabilistic independence between sets of variables has been extensively studied (DA WID (1979)), and it has been shown that graphical struc tures, such as Markov networks (LAURITZEN & SPIEGELHALTER (1988) ) or Bayesian networks (PEARL ( 1988)) provide a qualitative test for condi tional independence. Moreover, the use of such struc tures allow to define \"small\" sets of variables on which probability distributions can be given and then com bined using independence statements.\nIn the case of Markov networks, it suffices to specify probability distributions relative to the cliques of the network, and combine them into a single joint distri bution (LAURITZEN & SPIEGELHALTER (1988)).\nUsing Bayesian networks, probability distributions on one node conditionally to its parents are combined to get the joint distribution (PEARL ( 1988) ). In both cases, a local algorithm of belief upadating is provided, whose aim is to propagate the effect of incoming evidence in the network (LAURITZEN & SPIEGELHALTER (1988), PEARL (1988)).\nThe algorithms exploit relations of independence dis played in the network and ignore irrelevant informa tion.\nThe effectiveness of these algorithms is a great advan tage for the use of probability theory in expert systems.\nHowever, it has been shown that similar algorithms of belief updating are also available in different frame works. SHAFER & SHENOY (1988) propose an algo rithm of local computation of marginals, available in the framework of valuations, when the global know ledge factorizes on the edges of an acyclic hypergraph.\nFor such valuations, an algorithm of belief updating in directed acyclic graphs has been proposed by CANO, DELGADO & MORAL (1993).\nIn possibility theory, such algorithms of belief upda ting in hypergraphs (DUBOIS & PRADE (1990)) or in directed acyclic graphs (FONCK & STRASZECKA (1991)) can also be used.\nHere we focus on possibility theory and provide a stu-\n222 Fonck\ndy of possibilistic conditional independence between sets of variables. The definition of possibilistic inde pendence proposed here is different from the one intro duce by ZADEH, called no-interactivity. We use it as an irrelevance relation between pieces of information.\nConditional independence relations are introduced in section 2 and possibility theory is recalled in section 3.\nPossibilistic conditional independence relations are then defined in section 4 and compared with the re lations of no-interactivity. The properties of these re lations are drawn. Section 5 brings the conclusion.\n2 Conditional independence relations\nIn this paper, we will focus on independence between sets of variables, rather than on independence between events.\nLe\ufffd us denote by X a finite set of variables, taking values in finite sets. The frame associated to variable X is denoted by Ox, and throughout this paper, the notation OA stands for ( X nA), with A\ufffd X. XEA Let T(:K) denote the set of triplets of pairwise disjoint subsets of X.\nDefinition 1 A conditional independence relation on X is a subset I of T(X). When (A, B, C) E I, A is said independent from B, conditionally to C, for the relation I.\nSome conditional independence relations play a central role in inference networks theory.\nDefinition 2 A semigraphoid on X is a conditional independence relation I on ::K fulfilling the following properties :\n\u2022 symmetry : (A, B, C) E I:::} (B, A, C) E I \u2022 decomposition :\n(A, B u C, D) E I :::} (A, B, D) E I\n\u2022 weak union :\n(A, B u C, D) E I:::} (A, B, CuD) E I\n\u2022 contraction :\nA graphoid on X is a semigraphoid I on X fulfilling also the property :\n\u2022 intersection :\n(A,B,CUD)EI } (A, C, BuD) E I :::} (A, B u C, D) E I\nGraphoids are conditional independence relations which can be uniquely represented through an inferen ce network, i.e. a directed acyclic graph whose nodes are the elements of X and links express relations of dependence.\nSemigraphoids can also be represented by such net works, but this representation is not unique. Proba bilistic independence relations induced by strictly po sitive probability distributions are graphoids : this re sult was used by PEARL (1988) to propose a method to build a probabilistic knowledge-base from local in formations and to achieve an inference process, based on Bayesian networks.\nOther types of graphoids are also encountered : see for example HUNTER (1991).\nIn t his paper, we are mainly interested by possibilistic conditional independence relations. Let us first settle some basic notions about possibility distributions.\n3 Possibility distributions\nPossibility distributions can be used to model uncer tain pieces of information about the elements in X.\nDefinition 3 A normalised possibility distribution on 0\ufffd is an application 7r from n\ufffd into [0, 1], such that :Jx E 0\ufffd: 1r(x ) = 1. Let us note that a normalised possibility distribution over a finite set !1\ufffd induces a possibility measure on (Ox, P(Ox)), defined by TI(A) =sup 1r (x ) , VA E P(O\ufffd). xEA In an equivalent way, a possibility distribution 1r over Ox can be seen as the membership function of a fuzzy set.\nFor any x E Ox, the number 1r(x) represents the de gree of possibility of the event \"the multidimentional variable (X)xE\ufffd takes the value x\", or the degree of membership of x to the fuzzy subset of the possible values of the multidimensional variable (X)xEX\u00b7 Two basic operations on possibility distributions are defined.\nThe operation of marginalization consists in the ex\ufffd traction from a body of knowledge about the elements in ::K of some information about a subset of .::\u00ab:.\nDefinition 4 The marginalization of the possibility distribution 1r on Ox to A \ufffd X is the possibility dis tribution 7r A defined on OA by\n7rA(XA) = max n(xA, y), VxA E !1A. yEOX\\A\nThis distribution 1r A is the least restrictive distribution defined on OA, compatible with 1r. The operation of marginalization obeys of course the consonance pro perty.\nConditional Independence in Possibility Theory 223\nProperty I If B \ufffd A \ufffd ::K and rr is a possibility distribution over D\ufffd, then (rrA)B = 7rs.\nConditional possibility distributions can also be com puted from a joint distribution.\nSuch distributions are used to express the relationships between different subsets of ::K. The definition of these distributions is based on the choice of an operation of conjunction.\nDefinition 5 An operation of conjunction is a func tion c from [0, 1] x [0, 1] into [0, 1], continuous, non decreasing in both arguments, and such that\nc(O, a) c(l, a)\nc(a,O) = 0, \"ia E [0, 1] c(a,l) =a,\"iaE [0,1].\nDefinition 6 If A and B are disjoint subsets of\ufffd and 7f is a normalised possibility distribution over n\ufffd. then the possibility distribution over A conditionally to B induced by 1r is\n7rAIB DAuB--> [0, 1]\n(xA, XB) ----> SSc(ns (xs ), (nAuB (xA, XB) ),\nwith\nSSe( a., b)= sup{s E [0, 1]: c(s, a):::; b}.\nExamples of conditional possibility distributions are g1ven below.\nExample 1 If c denotes a Lukasiewicz - like T - norm, i.e. if c(a, b) = rp-1(Tm(rp(a), rp(b)), with\nTm(a, b)= max(O, a+ b- 1), 'ia, bE [0, 1]\nand rp denotes a continuous strictly increasing function from [0, 1] into [0, 1], such that rp(O) = 0 and rp(l) = 1; conditional possibility distributions are defined by :\n<p(T,)( ) 1rAIB XA,XB rp-1(rp(7rAuB(XA,XB))- rp(ns(xs)) + 1).\nExample 2 If c denotes a product-like T-norm, i.e. if c(a, b)= rp-1(rp(a)rp(b)), conditional possibility distri butions are defined by\n<p(P)( ) 1r AlB XA,XB { 1n-l( 'f(7rAuB(XA,XB))) if 7f (X ) > 0 r 'f(7r8(xB)) B B 1 else\nExample 3 If c = min, conditional possibility distri butions are defined by\n\"'\"' ( ) 7rAIB XA,XB\n{ ITAuB(XA,xs) if nAus(xA, xs) < rrs(xs) 1 else\nThese three types of conjunctions will be examined in the following. Whatever the conjunction c used, the identity c(nAIB\u2022 7rs) = 7rAuB is of course true, for any distribution rr. However, the distribution 1r AuB cannot be recovered from 1r A and 1fs, unless independence statements are expressed.\nIndependence relations are introduced in the next sec tion.\n4 Possibilistic conditional independence relations\nLet rr be a normalised possibility distribution over OJK.\nBy analogy with probability theory, the conditional independence relation induced by 1r on \ufffd is based on conditional distributions induced by n.\nDefinition 7 The conditional independence relation I\ufffd induced by n is defined as :"}, {"heading": "I\ufffd {(A, B, C) E T(\ufffd) : 7f\ufffdIBUC = 7f\ufffdIC", "text": "and 7r\ufffdIAUC = 1f\ufffdlc}.\nLet us note that in possibility theory, the equivalence c c c c\n7rAIBuC = 7rAIC {=> 7rBIAUC = 7rBIC\nis not fulfilled, as can be seen with the following exam ple.\nExample 4 Let\ufffd= {X1>X2, X3}, Dx1 = Dx2 = Dx3 = {0, 1}, and\n0.7 if { 0.6 if\nrr(x,,x2,x3)= 0.8 if\nThen\nand\n0.9 if 1 if X[= 0 Xt = 1, X2 = 0, X3 = 0 x, = l,x2 =O,x3 = 1 Xt,X2 = 1,X3 = 0 X!= X2 = X3 = 1\nThis conditional independence relation can be inter preted in the following way : the sets A and B are independent, conditionally to C if and only if once the values of the elements of C are known, further infor mation about the elements of B is irrelevant for A, and further information about the elements of A is irrelevant for B.\nThis notion of independence is stronger than the one commonly used in possibility theory, which was intro duced by ZADEH.\nThis notion, called \"no-interactivity\" is defined as: A and B are not interacting on each other, conditionally\n224 Fonck\nto C, for the distribution 1r, if and only if 7rAuBIC factorizes into min(1r Ale, 7rBIC ), where the conjunction used is the minimum operator. This can be extended to the case of any conjunction.\nDefinition 8 The relation of no-interactivity N I\ufffd in duced by 1r on ::\u00ab. is defined as :\nHaving two different independence relations, we now examine them in three particular cases : Lukasiewicz - like T-norms, product - like T-norms and minimum operator.\n4.1 Lukasiewicz - like T - norms\nThe following result shows the equivalence between conditional independence and no-interactivity, when a Lukasiewicz- like T-norm r.p(Tm) is used as a con junction.\nProperty 2 If 1r is a normalised possibility distribu tion on Dx, then\nand (A, B, C) E J'f(Tm) if and only if r.p ( 7rAuBuc) + r.p(1rc) = r.p ( 7rAuc) + r.p(7rsuc ).\nFurthermore, the following result provides a sufficient condition for a triplet (A, B, C) to be an element of J'f(Tm)\nProperty 3 If there exist possibility distributions f AuG and j BuG, respectively defined On llAuC and llBuc, such that"}, {"heading": "UAuc)c = Usuc)c,", "text": "7rAuBuc = r.p(Tm)lfAuc, !sue), and r.p(.f AUG)+ r.p(f BuG) 2: 1, then (A, B' C) E r:(Tm).\nProperty 4 The relation r:(Tm) is a graphoid. This last property shows that the relation r:(Tm) can be uniquely represented by an inference network.\nRemark : Using a Lukasiewicz- like T- norm as an operation of conjunction, we get a conditional measure of possibility 0(./A) such that O(A/A) is in general different from 0. If this property, expressing the in compatibility between a crisp event and its contrary, seems necessary for the user, the Lukasiewicz- like T norms should be neglected to define a conditional pos sibility measure, to the benefit of another conjunction, such as the minimum operator, or a product - like T norm.\n4.2 Product-like T-norms\nWhen a product - like T-norm r.p(P) is used as a con junction to define conditional possibility measures, the relations of independence and no-interactivity are no longer equivalent, as stated in the following result.\nProperty 5 Let 1r be a normalised possibility distri bution over !1JK and (A, B, C) E T(JK). Then (A, B, C) E Ntf(P) if and only if\nr.p(7rAuBuc)r.p(7rc) = r.p(7rAuc)r.p(7rBuc).\nMoreover, (A, B, C) E tfCPJ if and only if (A, B, C) E N J'f(P)\nand\nVxc E !lc such that Kc(xc) > 0, if there exists XB E Ds: 7rBuc(xs,xc) = 0, then\n7rAuc(xA,xc) = 7rc(xc), VxA E nA and Vxc E De such that 7rc(xc) > 0, if there exists XA EllA: 7rAuc(XA,Xc) = 0, then\n7rBuc(xs,xc) = 7rc(xc),VxB E !lB.\nThe properties of I'f(P) and N I'f(P) are listed below.\nProperty 6 The relation I'f(P) is a graphoid. The relation N r:(P) is a semigraphoid.\nLet us note that N I'f(P) is not a graphoid : this can be seen on the following example.\nExample 5 Let JK = {X1,X2,X3}, nx. = {0, 2}, !1x2 = { -1, 1} = nx3, and\n{ 1 ifx1 = O,x2 = 1,x3 = -1 7r(x1,x2,x3) = 1 ifx1 = 2,x2 = -1,xs = 1\n0 else\nThen\nand\n({XI}, {X2}, {Xs}) ({XI}, {X3}, {X2}) E E NJ<P(P) ,. N J<P(P) ,. ,\nWe thus get a notion of no-interactivity weaker than the one of conditional independence. Let us note that, if 1r is a strictly positive possibility distribution, then J<P(P) = N f<P(P) ,. ,. ' and the results about I'f(P) are quite similar to the results about probabilistic independence relations.\nConditional Independence in Possibility Theory 225\n4.3 Minimum operator\nWhen the minimum operator is used as a conjunction, the independence property can be expressed as a pro perty of the joint distribution.\nProperty 7 Let 1r be a normalised possibility distri bution over !1:\u00a5:: and (A, B, C) E T(Xi). Then\nand\n(A, B, C) E I;:' in if and only if 1TAuBuc\n1rc = max(7rAuc, 1TBuc). Moreover, (A, B, C) E N J;:'in if and only if\n7rAuEuc = min(7rAuC,7rEuc). As in the previous case, no-interactivity is weaker than conditional independence.\nProperty 8 The relation J;'in is a graphoid. The relation N J;:'in is a semigraphoid.\nExample 5 shows that N J;:'in is not a graphoid it lacks the intersection property.\n5 Conclusion\nln this paper, we have considered two types of possi bilistic independence relations : conditional indepen dence relations and no-interactivity relations.\nThese two notions were shown to be in general not equivalent, and their properties were listed.\nConditional independence relations are graphoids : they can thus be used for the building of a Markov network or an inference network to model an uncer tain knowledge-base.\nNo-interactivity relations in general lack the intersec tion property : these relations cannot be used for the building of a Markov network and their representation through an inference network is not unique.\nMoreover, conditional independence can be interpre ted in terms of relevance of information. That is why we have chosen to use possibilistic condition al independence for the modelling of an uncertain knowledge-base through an inference network, and lo cal algorithms of belief revision are then available (see FONCK (1993)).\nReferences\nBENFERHAT S., DUBOIS D., PRADE H.
