We distinguish two different types of abstraction: abstraction within the action and abstraction between actions. We define what it means that the abstraction of an action is correct, and then derive two methods of abstraction within the action and two methods of abstraction between actions that are correct according to this criterion. We illustrate the techniques developed by applying them to actions described with the representation of temporal actions used in the DRIPS decision theoretical planner, and we describe how the planner uses abstraction to reduce the complexity of planning.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:16:31 GMT  (985kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6812v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter haddawy", "anhai doan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6812"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6812.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Abstracting Probabilistic Actions", "authors": ["Peter Haddawy", "AnHai Doan"], "emails": ["@cs."], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "Abstract probabilis\u00ad tic modeling of action", "author": ["L.
