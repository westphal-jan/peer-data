These statements formalized certain types of causal interaction in which (1) the effect is independent of the order in which causes are introduced, and (2) the influence of an individual cause on the effect does not depend on what other causes were previously applied. In this paper, we introduce an equivalent to a temporal characterization of causal independence based on a functional representation of the relationship between causes and effects. In this representation, the interaction between causes and effects can be described as a nested division of functions. Causal independence can be exploited by displaying this division in the faith network, resulting in representations that are more efficient for conclusions than general causal models. We present empirical results showing the benefit of a causal representation of independence for faith network references.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:16:44 GMT  (1105kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6814v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"], ["v2", "Sun, 17 May 2015 00:03:17 GMT  (220kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6814v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david heckerman", "john s breese"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6814"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6814.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A New Look at Causal Independence", "authors": ["David Heckerman John", "S.
