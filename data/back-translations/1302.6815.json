The algorithms have two components: a scoring metric and a search method. The scoring metric is based on a network structure, statistical data and a user's prior knowledge, and delivers a score proportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the data. The search method generates networks for evaluating a user's prior knowledge based on the scoring metric. In particular, a user can express his knowledge - largely - as a single prior Bayesian network for the domain. Second, we describe local search and annealing algorithms that are used in conjunction with scoring metrics. In the specific case, we will show that each node has a polyheuristic parent element that can be replaced by at most one.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:16:50 GMT  (1221kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6815v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"], ["v2", "Sat, 16 May 2015 23:46:48 GMT  (183kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6815v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david heckerman", "dan geiger", "david maxwell chickering"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6815"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6815.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Bayesian Networks: The Combination of Knowledge and Statistical Data", "authors": ["David Heckerman", "Dan Geiger"], "emails": ["heckerma@microsoft.com,", "dang@cs.technion.ac.il,", "dmax@cs.ucla.edu"], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We describe scoring metrics for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of user knowledge and statistical data.
