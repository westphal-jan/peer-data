In this paper, we attempt to combine two branches of research devoted to such predictions: causal modeling and decision analysis. First, we provide a definition of causal dependence in decision-analytical terms, which we derive from the consequences of causal dependence cited in the literature. Using this definition, we show how causal dependence can be represented within an influence diagram. Specifically, we identify two shortcomings of an ordinary influence diagram as a representation of the cause. We introduce a special class of influence diagrams called causal influence diagrams, which correct one of these problems and identify situations in which the other inadequacy can be eliminated. Furthermore, we describe the relationship between Howard Canonical Form and existing graphs of the cause.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:16:56 GMT  (1126kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6816v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"], ["v2", "Sat, 16 May 2015 23:48:17 GMT  (161kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6816v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david heckerman", "ross d shachter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6816"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6816.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Decision-Based View of Causality", "authors": ["David Heckerman"], "emails": ["heckerma@microsoft", "shachter@camis.stanford.edu"], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "Decision Analysis, EES231 Course Notes.
