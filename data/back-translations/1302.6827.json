This probability mapping induces a Dempster-Shafer belief function, which measures the probability that a statement can be derived from the evidence. This belief function can be used in various ways to define a non-monotonous sequence relationship. We examine and compare these sequence relationships, and briefly consider the case of prioritized knowledge bases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:00 GMT  (1261kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6827v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jerome lang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6827"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6827.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Syntax-based default reasoning as probabilistic model-based diagnosis", "authors": ["Jerome Lang", "Paul Sabatier"], "emails": ["lang@irit.fr"], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We view the syntax-based approaches to de\u00ad fault reasoning as a model-based diagnosis problem, where each source giving a piece of information is considered as a component.

This leads to a probability assignment on the set of candidates, or equivalently on the set of consistent environments. This probability assignment induces a Dempster-Shafer belief function which measures the probability that a proposition can be deduced from the evi\u00ad dence.
