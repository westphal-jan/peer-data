U-Plan uses uncertain and incomplete evidence to describe the environment, characterizes it using a Dempster-Shafer interval and generates a series of possible world states. Planning is drawn up in an abstract hierarchy where strategic decisions are made before tactical decisions. Searching through this abstraction hierarchy is guided by a quantitative metric (expected fulfillment) based on decision theory. The search strategy is best with the determination to update the expected fulfillment and review earlier decisions in the light of planning developments. U-Plan generates multiple plans for several possible worlds and attempts to use existing plans for new world situations. Subsequently, a superplan is created based on the merging of the plan set and appropriately timed acquisitions, while choosing between planning alternatives.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:23 GMT  (1035kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6831v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["todd michael mansell", "grahame smith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6831"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6831.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Operator Selection While Planning Under Uncertainty", "authors": ["Grahame Smith", "Todd Michael Mansell"], "emails": ["tmm@cs.mu.oz.au.", "gsmith@cs.mu.oz.au"], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "Sensitivity Analysis of Continuous and Discrete Systems in the Time and Frequency Domains", "author": ["W.J.

U-Plan uses uncertain and incomplete evidence describing the environment, characterises it using a Dempster\u00ad Shafer interval, and generates a set of possible world states. Plan construction takes place in an abstraction hierarchy where strategic decisions are made before tactical decisions. Search through this abstraction hierarchy is guided by a quantitative measure (expected fulfilment) based on decision theory. The search strategy is best first with the provision to update expected fulfilments and review previous decisions in the light of planning developments. U-Pian generates multiple plans for multiple possible worlds, and attempts to use existing plans for new world situations. A super-plan is then constructed, based on merging the set of plans and appropriately timed knowledge acquisition operators, which are used to decide between plan alternatives during plan execution.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
