Given a mixture of such observation and causal theorems, as well as the topology of the causal diagram, the calculation derives new conditional probabilities of both types, thus allowing to quantify the effects of actions (and strategies) from partially specified knowledge bases, such as Bayesian networks in which some conditional probabilities may not be available.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:47 GMT  (976kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6835v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6835"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6835.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Probabilistic Calculus of Actions", "authors": ["Judea Pearl"], "emails": ["judea@cs."], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We present a symbolic machinery that admits both probabilistic and causal information about a given domain and produces proba\u00ad bilistic statements about the effect of actions and the impact of observations.
