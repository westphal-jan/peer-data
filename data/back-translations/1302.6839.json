NoisyMAX, a generalization of the Noisy OR Gate, is used to model causal dependencies in a BN with multi-value variables. We describe the use of leak probabilities to enforce the assumption of the closed world in our model. We present Netview, a visualization tool based on causal independence and the use of leak probabilities. Netview software allows knowledge engineers to dynamically view subnetworks for knowledge engineering and provides version control for editing a BN. Netview creates subnetworks in which leak probabilities are dynamically updated to reflect the missing parts of the network.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:19:10 GMT  (1623kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6839v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["malcolm pradhan", "gregory m provan", "blackford middleton", "max henrion"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6839"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6839.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Knowledge Engineering for Large Belief Networks", "authors": ["Malcolm Pradhan", "Gregory Provan", "Max Henrion"], "emails": [], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "A diagnostic method that uses causal", "author": ["G.F.
