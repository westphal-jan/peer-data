By varying the granularity of the state spaces, one can exchange the accuracy of the result for the computational efficiency. We present a procedure for approximate evaluation of probable networks that can be applied at any time, based on this idea. Applied to some simple networks, the procedure shows a gentle improvement of the approximation quality with increasing computational time. This suggests that the abstraction of state spaces is a more useful control parameter for the development of probable arguments in real time.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:20:17 GMT  (985kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6850v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael p wellman", "chao-lin liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6850"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6850.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "State-Space Abstraction for Anytime Evaluation of Probabilistic Networks", "authors": ["Michael P.
