INTRODUCTION\nolorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Colorectal cancers start in the\nlining of the bowel and grow into the muscle layers underneath then through the bowel wall [3]. TNM staging involves the Classification of Malignant Tumours\n\u2022 Tumour (T). Size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue \u2022 Nodes (N). The extent to which regional lymph nodes involved \u2022 Metastasis (M). This is the spread of a disease from one organ or part to another non-adjacent organ.\n4 TNM stages (I,II,III,IV) are generated by combining these three indicator levels and are allied with increasing severity and decreasing survival rates. Treatment options include minor/major surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy but the correct treatment is heavily dependent on the unique features of the tumour which are summarised by the TNM staging. Choosing the correct treatment at this stage is crucial to both the patients survival and quality of life. A major goal of this research is\nto automatically optimize the treatment plan based on the existing data. The data for this research was gathered by scientists and clinicians at City Hospital, Nottingham. The dataset we use here is made up of the 84 attributes for 462 patients. The attributes are generated by recording metrics at the time of tumour removal, these include:\n\u2022 Physical data (age, sex etc) \u2022 Immunological data (levels of various T Cell subsets) \u2022 Biochemical data (levels of certain proteins) \u2022 Retrospective data (post-operative survival statistics) \u2022 Clinical data (Tumour location, size etc). In the research into the relationship between immune response and tumour staging there has been some support of the hypothesis that the adaptive immune response influences the behavior of human tumors. In situ analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells may therefore be a valuable prognostic tool in the treatment of colorectal cancer [7]. The immune and inflammation responses appear to have a role to play in the responses of patients to cancer [8] but the precise nature of this is still unclear. The goal of this research is to assess the clustering behavior of this dataset to see how best the data can be grouped, how many clusters it should be grouped into and what these clusters represent. It is hoped that this may eventually help clinicians to decide how best to treat patients based on their biological, chemical and physical attributes at the time of tumor resection . Clustering is the act of assigning a set of n- dimensional attribute sets to clusters so that the members of one cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. If we define how patients can be optimally clustered into groups and how many groups they should clustered into, we can then assess how well these clusters match to key metrics such as survival and physical tumour grading. C\nThis paper solely discusses unsupervised methods to represent the dataset. By removing supervised guidance we are allowing for undirected analysis of the data to inform us of features that may otherwise be missed. We have made a parallel effort to perform supervised modeling but this beyond the scope of this paper. Supervised efforts on cancer biomarker datasets have previously shown interesting relationships in the data and a phenomena called \u201cAnti-learning\u201d where testable feature detection using standard learning methods appears impossible when modeling of low sample sizes in high dimensional feature spaces is attempted [1,2].\n."}, {"heading": "II. DATA ANALYSIS", "text": "The dataset supplied is a biological dataset and as such has a rich complement of preprocessing issues. 11.32% of the values are missing, with some attributes having over 40% missing values and some patients having over 30% missing values. Saying this, it is still an invaluable record of an extensive set of attributes from a relatively large number of patients.\nMissing data poses a problem for most modelling techniques. One approach would be to remove every patient or every attribute with any missing data. This would remove a large number of entries, some of which only have a few missing values that are possibly insignificant. Another approach is to average the existing values for each attribute and to insert an average into the missing value space. The appropriate average may be the mean, median or mode depending on the profile of the data.\nMuch of the data takes the form of human analysis of biopsy samples stained for various markers. Rather than raw cell counts or measurements of protein levels we are presented with thresholded values. For instance, CD16 is found on the surface of different types of cells such as natural killer, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. The data contains a simple 0 or 1 for this rather than a count of the number of cells. This kind of manual inspection and simplification is true for most of the data and any modeling solution must work with this limitation.\nIt is apparent that there are some existing strong correlations in the data. By using a combination of correlation coefficients and expert knowledge the data was reduced down to a set of ~50 attributes. This included removing several measurements that were hindsight dependent (ie. chemo or radio treatment) and correlated with TNM stage. (ie. Dukes stage).\nSingle attribute relationships exist within the dataset but are not strong. Analysis of single attributes can yield a greater than 65% prediction rate when attempting to predict which TNM stage a patient was classified as but only ~55% when the TNM stages were restricted to the more interesting (TNM stage 2 or 3). If we look at CD59a and\nCD46 threshold values we can see that they are loosely related to survival (figure 1) with elevated levels of each indicating a reduction in survival averaging ~13 and 6 months. (Fig. 1a and b)"}, {"heading": "III. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING AND OPTIMAL CLUSTER NUMBERS", "text": "We initially look at how TNM stages are represented in the whole dataset when it is optimally clustered using a kmeans approach [4]. This aims to divide multidimensional data into k clusters where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. We quickly see that clustering based on biochemistry and physical attributes does not classify patients into the same classes as the TNM stages. Table 1 is a truth table for TNM stages 2 and 3 and a 2 cluster k-means approach showing that each cluster has a very similar number of patients that were TNM stage 2 and 3.\nIf we look at the survival rates for patients in each of the 2 clusters we see there is very little difference at averages of 41.75 and 41.98 months respectively, as opposed to 46.78 and 36.36 months for TNM stage 2 and 3 patients respectively. This would suggest that when we optimally cluster the biochemical data into 2 clusters, membership of the resulting clusters is a poor indicator of survival.\nIf we look at optimal 3 and 4 cluster solutions we get a much wider difference in survival periods for each cluster. Average survival periods for the three cluster solution were 39.56, 40.89 and 44.29 months and for the 4 cluster solution were 36.87, 40.15, 41.43 and 46.68 months. The TNM stages in each cluster are evenly spread suggesting survival can be predicted as well based on the biochemical marker combinations as the TNM stages. Figure 2a and 2b shows 2 of the 4 clusters, cluster 2 has the lowest survival rate at 36.87 months and cluster 4 has the highest survival rates at 46.68 months. If we look at the most widely differing attributes we can see that there are strong differences in the representation of these attributes in each cluster when compared to the average. To put this into context, nearly 60% of patients in cluster 2 had an elevated level for FLIP while only 21% of patients in cluster 4 had elevated levels of FLIP. FLIP is a key regulator of colorectal cancer cell death [10] so this wouldn\u2019t be surprising as the presence of it in patients may indicate more aggressive tumours."}, {"heading": "IV. CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF DATASETS", "text": "Using research by Soria et al [5] as a basis we attempted to discover the optimal number of classes patients with different TNM stage tumours should be classified into. We had been largely unsuccessful in classifying patients into their TNM stages based on their attribute measurements and one possible reason for this is that the patients actually belong to 3 or more classes and attempting to classify them in a binary way resulted in poor performance.\nIn particular we implement a shorter version of the algorithmic framework, proposed by Soria et al [9], which combines different clustering algorithms and, with the use of Validation Indices, tries to define the optimal number of classes that describe the dataset. After this a method called Consensus Clustering is used to define the classes. The proposed framework consists of up to 7 steps, of which we will use the first 4, these are:\n1. Preprocessing : This step includes the deletion of rows which contain missing values, data transformation and the calculation of descriptive statistics.\n2. Clustering : In this step various clustering algorithms are applied to the dataset including Hierarchical Clustering, K-means, PAM and Fuzzy C-means.\n3. Validation : In this step the utilisation of validation indices helps us to find the optimal number of clusters when this number is not known before the analysis.\n4. Visualization & Agreement : In this step we obtain a general characterisation of the cluster analysis we performed here through various plots\nWe began by taking a small subset of the data that had very few missing values (~0.5%) and only pertained to TNM stage 2 and 3 patients, replacing any missing values with the modal value. The main aim here was to define how many clusters would be required to classify the data optimally and if the resulting clusters resembled the TNM staging. A k-means clustering approach was then used on the dataset to optimally cluster the data into 2-15 clusters.\nEach of these clustering approaches was then tested to see how well the clusters fitted using 6 clustering indices to score them [6]. Results shown in figure 3 show that 3 or 4 clusters appears to be optimal for all 6 Indexes\nWe then ranked the performance of the six cluster indexing approaches for 2 to 10 clusters and calculated a value to represent performance using the reciprocal of the average ranking performance, with and without the Friedman Index (this index appeared to be the least reliable). The results from this (figure 4) would suggest that patients with TNM stage 2 and 3 tumours should be separated into 3 or 4 groups based on their immunology and chemistry statistics.\nIf we look in more detail at the cluster membership we can get an idea about how attributes are divided up into 3clusters (table 2). Discussing the role of each abbreviated attribute presented here is beyond the scope of this paper but it includes levels for various immune cell subsets (eg.\nCD68), tumour suppression proteins (eg. P53) and degree of mutation in sections of DNA (MSI). These results continue to confirm that the patients are optimally separated into greater than 2 groups based on their immunohistochemistry.\nNext we look at the relationship between the inclusion of missing values with predicted number of clusters. We have reported in detail the findings from two processed datasets that point to the data being optimally clustered into 3 datasets. In this section we analyse this finding further to see how the optimal number of clusters changes with dataset size and if there is any effect of adding data from patients with TNM stage 1 and 4 tumours\nIf we reduce the number of patients based on removing those with the most missing data points first, and then look at the optimal number of clusters for each resulting dataset we see a graph that suggests 3 or 4 clusters solutions are optimal for datasets with just TNM stage 2 and 3 tumours (figure 5).. This would suggest that the TNM staging may not a powerful reflection of physical and biochemical conditions of a patient at the time of operation. We can also look at the effect of removing attributes from the dataset one at a time based on missing values and seeing how this affects the optimal number of clusters for both the 2 and 4 TNM scenarios (Figures 6a and 6b). These show that 3 clusters to be most optimal, especially in the range of 25-35 attributes. This may be the most important range given that higher than this many more attributes with a high percentage of missing values are included and lower than 25 starts to exclude more and more important attributes. Overall it is shown that a dataset classified into 2 groups based on physical characteristics of the tumour does not agree with classification based on immune-histochemical data.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented results for a unique dataset based on the biochemical and factors associated with colorectal tumour patients. This dataset is limited in many ways, but extremely important nonetheless and understanding any relationships or features based on the dataset to hand is an urgent priority. Currently, the most important guide to postoperative treatment is the TNM grading of the removed tumour. We argue here that TNM grading may not be aligned to the biochemical status of the patient. Given that the ongoing treatment for a patient immediately after tumor resection is directly acting upon a patients biochemistry it could be argued that an understanding of this\nimmunological, biological and chemical status of the patient is at least as important as the physical characteristics of the tumour.\nIt is apparent that when clustering into 2 groups based on a selection of biochemical and physical characteristics is a poor representation of the patient state. There is no relationship between the new clusters and survival or TNM stage. This could be argued another way that 2 TNM stages for these patients is a poor representation of their biochemical status. When the number of clusters is examined it seems apparent that 3 or 4 clusters is optimal for patients, regardless of if they are from 4 TNM stages or just the most ambiguous TNM stage 2 and 3 group. Again, this would suggest that TNM staging is a poor representation of patients biochemical state.\nThe fact that prediction of survival can be achieved at comparable rates to TNM staging for 2 of the groups (36.67|36.87 and 46.68|46.78) suggests that survival is actually based on BOTH the physical metrics used for TNM staging AND the biochemical and immunological markers presented at the time of tumor resection.\nREFERENCES [1] A.
