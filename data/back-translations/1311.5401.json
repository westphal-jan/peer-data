Inference tries to identify good relations or properties associated to an object. In this sense it is also possible to test validity or consistency of a relation. Let be the proposition P = \u201ca cat is a stone\u201d is false or contradictory because a stone is not a living organism, though a cat is a living organism. P can be called paradoxal or contradictory. Sometimes society lives with contradictions such as tolerance to lots of death on roads or in wars but intolerance for death with diseases. In this paper we more specifically focuse on sources of potential contradictions which could spoil computation of information extraction. Formal semantics is attached to validate relations between a set of objects. Our focuse is not only to study issues is managing complexity of a logical proposition and how to compute if it true or false but given a text consisting of a set of sentences how to extract relations and see how they be asserted as non contradictory regards others relations extracted in others texts. So texts are the primary material of discussion. Chapter 1 presents relational ambiguities we can find in texts. We start to present a typology of logical relations. Given a type of relations, we explain how to extract such relations with markers in texts. But markers are not sufficient to detect a contradiction. A specialized language such as molecular corpus gives example of ambiguous relations (contradictory) that can not be detected with markers. Hence we show that global overview of words collocations in a corpuscan give a good signal about the structure. In our \u201cpublish or publish\u201d new era of research and development system, production of literature is high but a non-negligible percent of papers becomes false over time. It is possible to compile from Pubmed website 4,800 papers honestly accepted but hence officially retracted. Such amount of information is original to make a corpus of real texts, written with intentional to propose arguments and content to readers, in a real natural language, but knowing that the content has been invalidated ex-post by readers. To build a random text is quite easy but the grammar and arguments will not be normalized by how argumentation is made usually by \u201cnormal writers and experts\u201d, or natural language will not confirm standard used of official grammars and\ntexts normally used to make corpora. In this sense we can consider such texts as \u201cwellconstructed\u201d in the sense we can find such texts in nature (on official databases) and purely noisy. Chapter 2 presents a source of ambiguity coming from human interpretation of natural data. Scientific and technological texts are supposed to take their foundation from validated experimental devices producing experimental data. A device can be technological as a telescope in astronomy or a formular test in psychology. I present an overview of ambiguous interpretation across several sciences which should impact conclusions of practioners and the way they can restitute results in documents. We can not call it birth of controversy but ambiguous interpretability of data of specific results requiring validation by other techniques. Oftenly a controversy occurs when several techniques lead to opposite conclusions, as a protocol is supposed to be scientific when it gives a warranty of result reproductibility."}, {"heading": "I RELATIONAL AMBIGUITY IN DATA", "text": ""}, {"heading": "1.1 Antinomy and paradox in mathematics", "text": "In philosophy and logics, paradox has been attributed to greek rhetoric during the VII century before JC. First paradox has been the the lyer of Epimenide. It says that \u201ca man told that he was lying. What he said was true or false?\u201d In another way let reformulate in this way, Epimenide says \u00ab All Cretan are lyers.\u00bb This was considered by antic philosophers as a paradox. By the way, either Epimenide tell the truth, then he lyes (because he is Cretan), so its statement is false (because all Cretan lye). Either, in the contrary, Epimenide lyes by saying that, then its statement is false: there is at least one Cretan telling the truth, what is not contradictory, because it is the solution of the paradox. In modern mathematics, the logician Russel described the following paradox in 1902 formulated by this question: \u00ab is the class of all classes which are not element of themselves, element of itself? In 1919 he reformulated the statement in a vernacular language such as \u00ab The Barber of a given village shave exactly each person who does not shave himself. Question : does this barber shave himself ? \u00bb. If we search a solution in a predicative analysis framework the reasoning leads to a contradiction. Let be R = {x such that x is not an element of x}, If R is element of R then R matches \"x is not element of x \", hence R is not an element of R. So contradiction. If R is not element of R then R does not match \"x is not element of x\", that means R matches non-\"x is not element of x \" what is equivalent to \"x is element of x \" so R is element of R. Contradiction. The theory of sets permits to escape the contradiction because a set can not contain itself."}, {"heading": "1.2 Antinomy in linguistics", "text": "Poetry is, and was for a long, a playground for using words not usually used in same context such as in French: \u201cDans un temps proche et tr\u00e8s lointain\u201d or \u201cJe suis et je ne suis plus\u201d. More radically in any language we can find pairs of words associating contrary meanings. Most of them are verbs and adjectives such as : to move back / to move forward, to begin / to stop, to increase / to decrease, black / white, elitist / popular, fast / slow, big / small, wet / dry. We can also find what is called quasi-antonyms such as bon/terrible. According to Antoine Culioli [Culioli, 1987], contrary paires are illusion of language which better tends to construct complementary pairs in the sens of mathematical logics, such as \u201cwhite\u201d, and \u201cnon-white\u201d meaning any colour except white. For A. Cullioli, fuzzy sets should be an interesting framework but such formalism is too weak for a fine description.\nRecall families of linguistic antonomy [Herrmann et al, 1986]. Two lexical items are linked by antonomy relationship if it is possible to draw a symetry of their semantic features through an axis. Symetry can be defined in different ways, according nature of the support. We observe several support setting each one a different antinomy : - complementary antinomy concerns application (or non-application) of a property ( 'applicable' / 'non-applicable' , 'presence' / 'absence' ) : for instance, 'shapeless' is antonym\nof all having a form, the same about 'tasteless' , 'colorless' , 'odorless' , etc. about all should\nhave taste, colour, smell, \u2026In classical logics definition is - scalar antinomy concerns a property influencing a scalable value (high value, low value) :\nfor instance, 'hot' , 'cold' are symmetrical value of temperature; It is explianed by existence of a \u00ab neutral value \u00bb from which the others are settled. In classical logics it can be expressed by if R is the property having a reference value (neutral or median) - dual antinomy is concerned by existence of a property or an element considered as symmetrical by usage (for instance 'sun' 'moon' , or by natural or physical properties about\nstudied objects (for instance 'male' 'female' , 'head' 'foot' , \u2026);\nUsage of textual resources sucha as corpora occurred in the domain of psychology in 1989 with studies of Charles and Miller [Charles and Miller, 1989] aiming at checking with the help of the Brown Corpus, hypothese of Deese according to two adjectives with opposite meaning are supposed to be antonyms when they are considered switchables over most of their contexts [Deese, 1965]. A little bit later, [Justeson and Katz, 1991][Fellbaum, 1995][Willners, 2001][Jones, 2002] have defined a set of morpho-syntactic scheme to detect automatically antonyms candidates (see table 1). Such patterns can be also defined in another languages as French [Amsili, 2003](see table 2)."}, {"heading": "1.3 Relational ambiguity in a specialized domain", "text": "Table 2 presents what should look opoosition in textual according linguistic markers and rethorical expression. If we focused on a specialized discourse, opposition could take another expression. [Reinitz et al, 1998] have studied, in molecular biology, the fly species and shown an ambiguity in the role of SmaI-BglI protein to create the stripe 6 in the fly body.\nAccording to [Howard and Struhl, 1990] \u201cFurther deletion analysis of this region (particularly constructs ET44, 30 and 31) provides clear evidence that an 600 bp region of DNA (from position -8.4 to -9.0; ET31) contains all of the elements necessary and sufficient\nfor a relatively normal stripe 6 response (Fig. 3B). However, we note that this response seems to be displaced slightly posterior to the location of the endogenous stripe 6 at this stage. \u201c But according [Langeland et al., 1994] \u201cThe 526 bp SmaI-BglI reporter construct (6(526)lacZ) gives rise to strong lacZ stripe expression corresponding to h stripe 6.\u201d\nAnother example of contradiction is the one pointed out by [Giles and Wren, 2008] notifying a behavior uncertainty between c-jun and c-myc genes.\nAccording [Davidson et al, 1993] \u201c17 bet \u2013 Estradiol had little effect on expression of c-jun, jun B, jun D, or c-fos mRNA by MCF-7 cells over 12 h, although it stimulated c-myc expression 4-fold within 30 min.\u201d But [Bhalla et al, 1993] formulated differently such as \u201cIn addition, intracellularly, mitoxantrone-induced PCD was associated with a marked induction of c-jun and significant repression of c-myc and BCL-2 oncogenes.\u201d"}, {"heading": "1.4 Comparison of real and artificial corpora", "text": "We try to compare the lexical distribution and associations between an artificial corpus and a real corpus about the same size.\nDefinition 1: Corpus. A corpus is a collection of texts.\nDefinition 2: Specialized Corpus. A specialized corpus is written in a human vernacular language. It has to cover all discussions of a technical field from past to present.\nIf we follow definition 2, a specialized corpus covers whatever people can say about the field. A specialized corpus contains all relations of a given field. Let suppose two corpora C1 and C2 are specialized of the same field, if a relation is contained in C1 but not in C2, it means that C2 does not cover the field; to make a real corpus of the field C1 and C2 has to be merge, or C2 can be called a sub-corpus of the field. According to that we can not compare a specialized corpus with another of the same field. But we can create artififial corpora. An artifical corpus is influenced by lexical composition and grammar it uses.\nOur hypothesis here is that lexical distribution and the grammar can lead to a different density of relation. Hence we expect that only a specialized corpus will give a relational structure similar to another specialized corpus only.\nWe used different ten corpora and one specialized corpus. We made the ten corpora in terms of the size of documents or words of the specialized corpus. Among the ten corpora, four are artificial, they are settled with a mixture model (lexical distribution and grammar):\n \u201cCorpus BD\u201d is a real corpus is specialized about the biodiversity domain. It contains 4,655 abstracts of projects. Is has been created from BIODIVERSA database\ncontaining 6,500 projects with duplicates [htt1, 2013].\n \u201cCorpus PM\u201d is an artificial corpus built from 4,835 Pubmed retracted articles (Corpus PM). They form real texts written a proofed language but content is false since they\nhave been retracted frolm journals where published initially. It has been created from PUBMED database containing 21 millions of publications [http2, 2013].\n \u201cCorpus TC\u201d is a corpus of 6,049 abstracts of patents. We used 121 major codes of the IPC (international patent classification) ontology. For each code we keep 50 patents as\na uniform mixture model of topics. It has been created from EPO website containing 78 millions of patents [http3, 2013].\n \u201cCorpus SCI\u201d is a corpus of 5,111 abstracts of scientific papers. We used 52 major academic sections by the French Ministry of Research. For each code we keep 100\npublications as a uniform mixture model of topics.It has been build with WEB OF SCIENCE database containing 45 millions of publications [http4, 2013].\n \u201cCorpus RD\u201d is a corpus of 6,502 generated abstract at least containing 150 words from an automatic random text generator in marketing field. Used tool is called\n\u201ccorporate bullshit generator\u201d using a dependency grammar of basic sentences and a tree of 781 lexical items [http5, 2013].\n \u201cCorpus CS\u201d is a corpus of 8,000 generated abstracts from an automatic text generator called SCIgen which can generate artificial papers in compuer science with figures\nand citations. A generated paper has been accepted in 2005 to WMSCI, the World Multiconference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics [http6, 2013].\n \u201cCorpus SL\u201d is a corpus of 6,500 generated abstracts containing 150 words from randomized sequences generated randomly by a list of words. The list of words\ncommes from Wikipedia [http7, 2012] version is to date 28 April 2012. It contains 156,209 words. From this list we select a subpart of 1000 words to generate sentences.\n \u201cCorpus BL\u201d is a corpus of 6,500 generated abstracts containing 150 words from randomized sequences generated randomly in the same way than \u201ccorpus SL\u201d but with\nan extende lexical dictionary about 50,000 words.\n \u201cCorpus NG\u201d is a corpus of 3,971 among the 18,846 from 20 newsgroups from web forum exchanges.\n \u201cCorpus RT\u201d is a corpus of Reuters news. 6025 news were kept among the 21,578 of the collection.\n \u201cCorpus TW\u201d is a corpus consisting of 50,000 tweets in English. Length of each tweet is about 15 words. It comes from Twitter database.\nDistibutional study of frequent words leads to high informational signal capture through most significative occurrences under hypohesis that they repeat. Pioneering work of Georges Zipf shown a typical distribution x.y = Constant where x is the sorted rank over frequency and the y-axis is the number of occurrences of elementary lexical items in a long text or a ste of texts in a given language [Zipf, 1935]. Frequency is defined by the number of occurrrences of a lexical item in the corpus. We used R platform [R Core Team, 2013], and especially tm package [Feinerer et al, 2008] and basic matrix functions, to split corpora into elementary lexical items and to sort frequent items. Punctuation, figures and word smaller than 3 caracters had been deleted. When stemming the raw text, we keep only the root form of each word and the text is less dense as seen on the table 3.\nThe project envisages to continue and extend the studies of evolution and systematics in the grass genus Bromus and the legume genus Vicia supported by our ending Estonian Science Foundation Grant No.4082 for 2000-2003.

Distribution over corpora of words count, lemmatized word count, words occurring three times , words occurring two times, words occurring more than one time. Grey line represent the reference corpus about biodiversity.\nRegardless the kind of corpus, with ou without stemming, words occurring one time represent between 41.9 and 54.4 % of all features, words occuring 2 or 3 times represent between 38.7 and 47.7 % of all features occurring more than one time, or between 19.5 and 21.8 % of the whole set of items (see Figure 1).\nBeing aware of the large amount of items, and their distribution, frequency can offer an anchoring to catch strong lexical semantic signal about the content. For relevant feature extraction, a basic process relies on frequent items selection. We set a threshold to make a\ncomparison of itemset extraction. A reasonable figure should be 5% of documents, being a minimal freqaucny for a relevant frequent item. We call it Sf, this number knowing that an item can occur several times in the same document, and Sd a frequency threshold in terms of strict quantity of document in which a term need to be seen. Table 3 give results with Sf =240. Amount of frequent words is low, about 1-2 % of all lexical items. It may be readable quickly. It is quite powerful to get a crude idea of the content of a corpus.

Items sets of very-frequent words with threshold Sf=50% of documentsdu corpus (Sf =2400). At left Corpus BD; at right Corpus PM. Set of crude terms are in italic.\nWe can see (table 3 and table 4) that considering the \u201ctrue\u201d corpus the amount of frequent terms is a good signal for interpreting the biodiversity domain. Nevertheless for the \u201cfalse\u201d corpus the amount is a small signal only indicating that the majority of document talk about cell biology and medicine.\nNow turn to a macroscopic analysis of corpora. Lots of clustering algorithms leads to a sumarization of similarities between bags of words, one of them reveals close-in-context items within their collocations: k-nearest-neighbour algorihm (KNN). It has been created by [Cover et Hart, 1967] and leads to good results with different kinds of data. We can argue that frequent itemset extraction method of [Agrawal and Srikant, 1994] called apriori is a variant of KNN. An interesting property of this kind of algorithm is the low-level time-complexity. It is also efficient with sparse data like text data. To visualize a large global clustering we used the Igraph package implemented for large network analysis and visualization [Csardi and Nepusz, 2013]. Thirteen layout algorithms are available. We especially used the FruchtermanReingold layout which is force-based combining attractive forces of adjacents vertices, and repulsive forces on all vertices [Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991]. We also used the DrL layout (Distributed Recursive Layout) also force-based and using the VxOrd routine offering a multi-level recursive version to obtain a better layout on big graphs, and ability to add new nodes to a graph already displayed [Martin et al, 2011].\nDefinition 3. Data Structure\nLet be a data matrix where i represents i-th line and so the word i, j\nrepresents j-th column, hence the document j, n is the number of words and m the number of documents.\nDefinition 4. Neighbourhood Two items and are neighbours if it exists a document , where\nWe discussed previously that very-frequent words are interesting to extract. We want now not only to look a set of items but their relationships, and especially as a first step how this global set of relationships is featured. Visualization is a good tool fill this task because thousands of relationships are involved and no primary criteria permits to select a pool of specific or more relevant relationships. If we try to visualize the symetric data matrix of most frequent terms betweens each other for instance we get a bool of links without structural specificity; each items having the whole set of tiems as nearest neighbours. For improving clustering efficiency we need to operate a data reduction. Algorithm below shows a reduction by the weighted margin mean. Computing the incidency matri xis based on a simple reduction by substracting means of non-null values of each line to matrix value of the same line.\nDefinition 5. Data Reduction\nWhere <M>l is a mean vector of a line from M. plays as a regulation factor to regulate the rate of nearest neighbours, in fact the number of nearest neighbours is not defined explicitly.\nNearest-Neighbour Algorithm Input :\nM : a sparse matrix terms x documents, with dim(M)=(n,m) such that M[i,j] is the number of occurrences of a term i in the document j, Min : minimum frequency Max : maximum frequency Beta : scaling factor Binary : 0 if real data, 1 if data are binary\nOutput : Layout in 2-Dimensions # layout with Fruchterman algorithm\n1: Create a vector V, with dim(V)=n such that RowSums( M[i,] )<= Max and RowSums( M[i,] ) >= Min 2: M\u2019 = M[ V > 0 ] 3: Create is a matrix terms x terms : TD = M\u2019 * t(M\u2019) 4: Compute Vm the mean vector by line with dim(Vm) = n such that Vm[i] = mean(M[i,]) with M[i,j] =/= 0 for all j 5: IF Bin = 1 Make scaling operation, TD_norm = TD \u2013 Beta*Vm\nTD_ norm = TD_norm>=0\nELSE GoodVal = TD >= -1*Beta*Vm & TD <= +1*Beta*Vm\nTD_norm = TD * good_value 6: Binary transform, TD_norm[ TD_norm > 0 ] = 1 7: Keep positive values TD = TD_norm[ rowSums( TD_norm ) > 0] 8: Compute the mean of links per node, Nb_mean_link = mean(rowSums(TD)) 9: Generate the layout Fruchterman for display with TD as adjacency matrix. # layout with DRL 10: Create a vector V, with dim(V)=n such that V[i] <= Max and V[i] >= Min 11: Create a binary clone M of M, M\u2019 = M[ M > 1 ] <- 1 12: Create a vector V, with dim(V)=n such that RowSums( M\u2019[i,] ) <= Max and RowSums( M\u2019[i,] ) >= Min 13: M\u2019\u2019 = M[ V > 0 ] 14: Create matrix terms x terms : TD = M\u2019\u2019 * t(M\u2019\u2019) 15: TD\u2019 = TD [TD > 1 ] <- 1 16: Compute Vm the mean vector by line with dim(Vm) = n such that Vm[i] = mean(TD\u2019[i,]) with TD\u2019[i,j] =/= 0 for all j 17: IF Bin = 1 Make scaling operation, TD_norm = TD\u2019 \u2013 Beta*Vm\nTD_pos = TD_norm>=0\nELSE GoodVal = TD\u2019 >= -1*Beta*Vm & TD\u2019 <= +1*Beta*Vm TD_norm = TD * good_value\n18: Binary transform, TD_norm[ TD_norm > 0 ] = 1 19: Keep positive values TD = TD_norm[ rowSums( TD_norm ) > 0] 20: Compute the mean of links per node, Nb_mean_link = mean(rowSums(TD)) 21: Generate the layout DRL for display with TD as adjacency matrix.\nWe used the Fisher\u2019s Iris dataset to validate the clustering approach. The dataset consists of 150 individuals described by 4 features, and forming 3 classes (Table 5). Focusing on two classes (versicolor and verginica) only one feature makes a fine-grained discriminant classification (Petal.width) ; for sure, usage of a value mean with features is not able to capture this difference. Hence the algorithm presented above can only discriminate two classes as seen on figure 2.\nOur hypothesis, through visualization, aims at comparing different ranges of word frequency and at distinguishing their impact on global classification. Basically we could guess, on the one hand, that lexial items contribute equally each one to clustering. Even more we can suppose that more frequent words are more clustered than low frequent ones. On the other hand, we also could expect than \u00ab true \u00bb data (i.e. corpus BD) are quite more clustered than \u00ab false \u00bb data (i.e. corpus PM). As Zipf distribution shows it (Figure 1) range frequency can be considered as a good parameter to categorize numerically the lexical space. It is possible to define a partition of contiguous ranges depending upon the two first ranges and containing almost the same number of contexts.\nDefinition 6. Context A context of a lexical item is a text area in which can be seen an occurrence of a lexical item. Let w1 and w2 two lexical items. If f1 and f2 are, respectively, the frequency for each lexical items, C= f1+ f2 is the total number of contexts.\nFor instance 3 lexical items having frequency 2 generate 6 contexts. About the corpus BD table 6 shows that a series of frequency ranges from which the first two ones are [2-5] and [6- 12] produce 23 ranges and having in average 33,554 contexts.\n1st frequency range 2 -- 2 2 -- 3 2 -- 5 2 -- 9 2 -- 20 2nd frequency range 3 -- 3 4 -- 5 6 -- 11 10 -- 27 21 -- 60 averaged #contexts 6987 14547 26534 40911 58377 #range 42 20 11 6 5\n1st frequency range 2 -- 2 2 -- 3 2 -- 5 2 -- 9 2 -- 20 2nd frequency range 3 -- 3 4 -- 6 6 -- 12 10 -- 25 21 -- 65 averaged #contexts 9233 19200 33554 55331 96860 #range 83 40 23 14 8\nTable 6. Number of frequency ranges depending on the context size of the first two ones (upper table, Corpus PM; bottom table, corpus BD).\nLet K be a granularity factor (number of ranges) and Nc the averaged number of contexts per range, we observe that :\nGlobal visualization changes when we select a set of lexical items from different ranges. Figure 3 shows clustering drawing with range [2-5], figure 4 with range [2-3], figure 5 with range [2-20] and figure 6 with range [2-2]. Choosing the range [2-9], the equipartition series gives 8 ranges. Observing visualization for different ranges (figures 3, 4, 5 and 6) we argue that density of clusters evolve closely regards to size of frequency range and number of ranges in contexts associated (table 6). We observe also that density of high-frequent words clustered together, is different than low-frequent words clustered together. It seems that more frequent words reduce density of low-frequent ones in terms of class. From studies about argumentation scheme linking lexical items such as verbs, connector and noun or adjectives from the corpus BD we get a list of useful verbs for technical argumentation in scientific discourse. This set consists of 291 verbs and 705 different tokens (gerondif, past\u2026). In the figures points associated to one of the verb list is colored in red. Several tens of verbal forms belong to clustered area as well as for corpus PM and corpus BD. It means that some verbs are deliberately useful to argumentation to this or that technical context. But some red points can be seen near dense areas. It means clearly a polysemy of verbs playing role in differents contexts.\nwords (bottom left) frequency [6-9],  =2, < neighbours >=1, N=2022 words (bottom middle) frequency [2-5], =2, < neighbours >=1, N=5395 words (bottom right).\nbottom line, display of unstemmed words from the corpus BD: frequency [2-20] ;  =1 , < neighbours >=31, N=13997 words (DRL, bottom right),  =5, < neighbours >=1, N=5841 words (Fruchterman, bottom left)."}, {"heading": "1.5 Discussion", "text": "Some sciences try to learn close associations between components, we can cite chemistry and sociology. Some other sciences try to learn about more global structure like economy and astrophysics. Computational linguistics and lexical statistics are domains able to take overview of a whole set of relationships as well as focusing on specific relationships. In this chapter we try to show some results for a whole overview of closed relationships in same short documents, highlighted by some items involved in specific argumentative relationships. Firstly we try to explain how contradictions can occur explicitly in texts as specific relationships. Secondly two corpora have been studied to extract global information. They share common properties such as: short document size, technical domain, English language, natural distribution of lexical items, corpus size. Nevertheless one corpus is a domain studied by lots of people as a scientific active domain (i.e. biodiversity), the other consists of \u201choax\u201d documents written by people as true documents. Surprisingly there is a striking similarity of global clustering visualization between hoax documents and true documents. The texts are natural langage factual information interpreted by Humans. Originally experimental data generated or pretreated prior to lead to published interpretations. In the next chapter we try to highlight interpretation locks of evidence in several areas. Beyond syntactic associations Humans chooses their words based on their understanding that can not be stable and give rise to divergent views even paradox or contradiction.\nII SINGULAR AMBIGUITY IN DATA"}, {"heading": "2.1 Visual ambiguities", "text": "Medicine [Fang et al, 2004] [Kirkpatrick et al, 2006] [Pagenstert and Bachman, 2008] [Brusseau et al, 1999] [Lazyuk et al, 1996] [Blinov & Mazurov, 2011]\n[Canafoglia et al, 2006] [Palmu & Syrj\u00e4nen, 2005] [Kazmierczak et al, 2008] [Perea et al, 2007]\nPsychology [Peterson et al, 1992] [Grossmann and Dobbins, 2005] [Schirillo and Shevell, 1997] [ Maltby et al, 2008] [Cashera et al, 2007] [Robertson, 2000][Rakoczi and\nPohl, 2012][Kawabata, 1993][Kim et al, 2003][Drogemuller, 2009]\nNeurosciences [Carlen et al, 2006] [Habets et al, 2011] [Leznik et al, 2002] [Eagleman, 2011] [Grasman, 2004] [Coq et al, 2009] [Kreher et al, 2008] [Mayer et al, 2007]\n[Jitsev, 2010] [Wilfer-Smith, 2011]\nPhysics [Cai et al, 1994] [McIntosh et al, 2004][Chibani, 2003] [Honnicke et al, 2005] [Valiullin et al, 2003] [Kaye and Gordon, 1998] [November and Wilkins, 1992]\n[Feldstein et al, 2011] [Forrester et al, 2000] [Panero, 2010]\nBiology [Hentschel et al, 2007] [Carette and Ferguson, 1992] [Yu et al, 2010] [Palomares-Ruis et al, 2010] [Gantchev et al, 1992] [Ivanov, 2004] [Shin and\nPierce, 2004] [ DaSilva and Oliveira, 2008] [Gorbatyuk and Andronati, 1996] [Wood et Napel, 1992]"}, {"heading": "Medical Observation", "text": "The other important impediment is the ambiguous interpretation of therapeutic effects, in particular if the pretreatment stage is the delayed relaxation pattern as is usually observed in diabetic patients [Fang et al, 2004].

Clinical examination different signs and functional tests are in use with at times lack of quantification and problems of interpretation [Pagenstert and Bachman, 2008]. Analysis of multiexponential decays often leads to hard interpretation, confirming limited diagnostic value of relaxation times [Perea et al, 2007]. Presence of multiple positive peaks before and after averaged jerks led to ambiguous interpretation of the coupling between EEG transients and EMG potentials [Canafoglia et al, 2006]. Tympanograms can present ambiguous interpretation related to admittance [Palmu, et al, 2005]. [Ka\u017amierczak et al, 2008] found that symptoms with female patients with DM gives ambiguous interpretation of electrocardiogram ECG. Interpretation of X ray images is sometimes difficult, like object boundary points at different focal distances, inconsistency between anatomical sections and X ray projections and multiplicity of shades [Blinov et al, 2011].

Dynamic patterns induce a vivid sense of rotation in depth but with dubts either as leftward or rightward rotation about a vertical axis (corresponding to clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation)[Grossmann and Dobbins, 2005]. Luminance can have an impact such as an edge may be due to a difference in illumination, or a difference in reflectance, or both. Observers can vary the luminance of a small test [Schirillo and Shevell, 1997]. Plotting a statistical test can induce false impressions. For instance the use of the Scree Plot produced an ambiguous interpretation with a possible 'elbow' appearing after eigenvalues [Maltby et al, 2008]. According [Cashera et al, 2007] multimodal systems support people with different needs and different features during the interaction process however naturalness can usually produce ambiguous interpretation. [Robertson, 2000] describes a Minimum Description Length Agent Negotiation Image interpretation is fundamentally\nambiguous. Interpretation involves finding the most probable interpretation. What we \u201cSee\u201d is the most probable interpretation. [Rakoczi and Pohl, 2012] criticize reliability of existing eye tracking studies (within both and economic settings) may be impaired due to ambiguous interpretation. [Kawabata, 1993] assessed a rate to interpret correctly a picture when fixating a target. [Kim et al, 2003] give importance to memory associated to priming stimulus while the ensuing information of an ambiguous interpretation is referred to as target information. [Drogemuller, 200] assume ambiguous interpretation to geometric information, as standards for civil engineers, quickly come to the fore.\ncognitive imagery The low sensitivity of experiments with the currently available techniques have resulted in much conflicting data [Carlen et al, 2006]. When gesture precedes the coexpressive word by a relatively large margin, the upcoming speech cannot influence the interpretation of gesture. Thus, an ambiguous interpretation of the gesture is finalized and stabilized before the word onset [Habets et al, 2011]. [Leznik et al, 2002] remarked than in most imaging studies the interpretation of imaging pattern is based on subjective criteria that are open to ambiguous interpretation. [Eagleman, 2011] reports a competition among groups of neurons typically appears only in very specific contexts, in which sensory information lends itself to ambiguous interpretation (eg, binocular rivalry). [Grasman, 2004] describes interpretaion problem about Laplacian computation in neuro-electromagnteic signal origin between spatially high passed filtered topographies. [Coq et al, 2009] noticed that a deterioration of neuronal properties would likely result in ambiguous interpretation of tactile cues and undoubtedly contributed to a decline in grasp control, ultimately resulting in failed and repeated grasp attempts, as well as increased reach and grasp times. [Kreher et al, 2008] analyzed distribution of cortical fibers showing that the inherent limitations of the spatial resolution of diffusion tensor images, the limited sharpness of the orientation density function, and the ambiguous interpretation of the anisotropy of diffusivity concerning the cortical fibre direction may lead to false positive connections. [Mayer et al, 2007] describe brain chemistry as changes most often expressed as metabolite ratios, which although useful, can lead to ambiguous interpretation of data. [Jitsev, 2010] recall that the contextual support provided by learning such high-order relations is in general of crucial importance for correct interpretation of visual stimuli embedded in a larger context (e.g., object or scene). Their local appearance is usually highly ambiguous and can be correctly interpreted only if consulting additional contextual cues mediated by the connectivity formed during the previous experience with the visual input.

In astrophysical imagery values of parameters can induce misunderstanding [McIntosh et al, 2004]. Radar imaging provides an advantage for the earth change observation independently of weather conditions, however, the recognition of some features as roads is more difficult [Chibani, 2003]. In coronary applications, the position of the catheter changes a lot due to the curved nature of the arteries. This gives images that do not correspond to the expected cross section of the stent and lead to ambiguous interpretation by physicians [Brusseau et al, 1999]. [Honnicke et al, 2005] report that superposition of the details arising from those three main sources of contrast can result in ambiguous interpretation of the image though mathematical image processing such as diffraction enhanced images has been widely\nused to solve this problem. According [Valiullin et al, 2003] NMR relaxometry is apparently a more suitable method for probing a length scale but it is often hampered by complicated interpretation of the experimental data. In their patent [Kaye and Gordon, 1998] explains that imaging microparticles should be patterned in such a manner as to ensure that ambiguous pattern interpretation cannot occur in the case of 90, 180 or 270 degree rotation from the intended viewing orientation. About solid-state imaging [November and Wilkins, 1992] indicate that measurements from a single spectral point are subject to ambiguous interpretation of magnetic field with velocity and line strength. In fact high-voltage modulators are difficult to, maintain and control reliably. Visual observations can lead to misinterpretations such as auroral substorm observations as described in [Feldstein et al, 2011]. [Forrester et al, 2000] presents Laser Doppler Imaging as an established technique for the two dimensional measurement of tissue perfusion; But the uncertainty of photon penetration depth leads to ambiguous interpretation of what fraction of the tissue microcirculation is being sampled.

Data seems ambiguous due to thefact that the preparations used for crystallization were inactive. glasses formed in this system with socalled 'boron anomaly' i.e. alkaline earth metal cations. [Mechinskas, 2002] mentions that analysis of certain equivalent electric circuit tends to be subjective and lead to an ambiguous interpretation of the results. For an analysis of pulsed measurements to be more objective, they suggested that the data should be transferred from a time domain into a frequency domain. Crystalline structure is often taken as a reference to establish the dominant interaction pathway which forms the basis for modeling the magnetic behavior. However, this approach can lead to ambiguous interpretation of the magnetic data, mainly for systems where there is at least one possible pathway to weak magnetic exchange interaction [Florincio et al, 2012]. Molecular or supra-molecular nature of low lying valence excitations in condensed phase water lead to an ambiguous interpretation of the absorption spectrum and an unclear picture of the microscopic details that underline peak position [Cabral Do Couto and Chipman, 2012].

The importance of unequivocal annotation of microarray experiments is evident. The different probe and gene IDs corresponding to the two annotation releases generates uncertainties [Noth and Benecke, 2005]. PCR methods can sometimes be controversial and a post-PCR control has been shown to be often essential to confirm a sequence identity in case of ambiguous recognition of specific targets [Peano et al, 2005]. In some biological approaches ionophores were used for the demonstration of the electrogenic properties of the enzyme, which could lead to a problem of interpretation of electrogenicity [Eisenrauch and Bamberg, 1990].

Diagnosis relies on techniques, one of them is serology. In spite of the high sensitivity, routine serological tests provide results of ambiguous interpretation [Kompalic-Cristo, 2004]. Occasionally, unwanted nonspecific PCR products, of- ten in the size range of the expected product, are obtained during the amplification process; this can lead to ambiguous interpretation of results in ethidium bromide-stained gel anal yses [Battles, 1995].

Examining social and work contexts, behavioral cues of flirting did not appear to be confined to flirting interaction [Keyton and Rhodes, 1997]. Not least of all this has been because of the difficulty of defining ecological limits given a knowledge base that is usually imperfect and liable to ambiguous interpretation [Crean and Wisher, 2000]. Analysis of the main elements of both regulations affirms that there is an ambiguous interpretation of the socalled Preservation Zone (Suelo de Conservacion) that represents a territory subject to preservation given its ecological value in terms of climate regulation, water recharge, forest communities, agricultural cultivation, and hilly landscape. This situation favors illegal land use occupations [Aguilar, 2008]. [Wicklund, 1995] some cultures are unlikely to analyze others by reference to terms that stand for fixed behavior patterns, implying a more complex, but of course perhaps more ambiguous, interpretation and description of action. Nurses' professional role has traditionally included managing and coordinating patient care, and nursing education programs routinely stress nurses' care management role. [Cudney and VanTuyle, 2001] discovered that the scope of this role is ambiguous; interpretation differs among nurses. Ambiguity is contained into contracts between people.

Outgoing longwave radiation is ambiguous according [Schnadt et al, 1998] in the frame of the composites for the recurring tropical cyclones, since these cyclones usually undergo a transition from a tropical storm to an extratropical cyclone in the vicinity of the east. Strata onlapping the fold limbs provide evidence for coeval sedimentation and contraction. In the cores of major anticlines, structural complexity and lack of seismic resolution make difficult interpretation [Cobbold et al, 2004]"}, {"heading": "Medical measure", "text": "Evaluation of markers has not been treated as a universally accepted criterion, which can occasionally lead to uncertainties due to variations of these parameters [Casas Pina, 1999]. Observations from the inter-rater experiment 2 were used to adjust and improve the tool. Only a few criteria were found to contribute to the heterogeneity of rater results by causing misunderstandings [Schneider et al, 2009]. [Venturin et al, 2004] used published reports and recruited patients to build a common data structure in which to tabulate the information. For each patient, we added any new clinical sign that had not been included previously, thus obtaining a relational database with 103 fields. The presence of a specific sign was attributed only when it was explicitly reported and formalised in binary fashion (that is, present or not present). When a field could not be completed because of lack of information or an ambiguous interpretation, it was defined as null and was not counted. [Burek, 2005] noticed that free HCVAg (HCV core antigen) could enable the diagnosis of acute HCV infection. But some clinical situations present difficult interpretation of HBV and HCV markers because of\n\"unusual\" constellation. [Aubin and Humbert, 1995] The serologic evaluation of hepatitis B is difficult because of sometimes ambiguous interpretation of tests available. All the studies reviewed report that the diagnosis of internal hernia may be difficult because symptoms and signs may be very vague or masked by the body habitus of the obese patient, and physical examination [Iannelli et al, 2006]. Interpretation of the case\u2013control studies about myocardial infarction may be difficult because in a case\u2013control study the relative risk cannot be calculated directly, the odds ratio is used as a surrogate when the disease is rare [Arora et al, 1999]. The term hypotony has been used in many different contexts often leading to ambiguous interpretation of its clinical significance to visual function [Leen and Mills, 1999]. [Xing et al, 2011] mentioned that raters introduce errors, generate ambiguous interpretation of structures, and make careless mistakes. Performance level assessment is an important aspect of interpreting reported structures. [Wassenberg-Severijnen et al, 2003] critized that different scores between interviewers resulted partially from ambiguous interpretation of the item and/or the explanation."}, {"heading": "Economical measure", "text": "Comparison such as cost-income ratios can be not correlated with most of the other measures, this suggests it is an unreliable indicator of competition and inefficiency as a consequence of its ambiguous interpretation [Ozdincer and Ozyildirim, 2011]. The proportion of sample loans that are recorded as being secured with collateral is a characteristic to compare borrowers across countries. The interpretation of collateral as a risk variable is especially ambiguous [Smith, 2003]. [Starczak and Jakubiec, 2003] assert that some firms appreciate the significance of unambiguous documentation and define the details concerning the measurement strategy. But the ambiguous interpretation of design requirements still too often exists in practice. In a test, Subjects were asked about their price-quality beliefs for twentyeight product categories. However, after pre-test, items for the threshold and price-level variables were dropped due to ambiguous interpretation by subjects [Smith and Natesan, 1999]. [Holcombe, 1992] points out ambiguous interpretation of the general welfare in the US Constitution. [Durand, 2007] suggests correcting the prices of inputs in produced units for quality changes, thereby concealing both product and process innovations into the measure of inputs; If measure of multifactor productivity would incorporate product innovations into the measure of inputs but leave process innovations this would give the productivity residual an ambiguous interpretation. [Stanley, 2000] notifies that some researchers admit economical models may correctly capture underlying economic relations at some point in time, but that these relations are themselves sensitive to sensitive to policy changes. Interpretation of models with data over time could be unstable. The capital to assets ratio reflects on the one hand, regulatory costs which banks try to shift onto customers, and on the other purports to measure credit risk. The resulting positive relationship between this ratio and the interest margin lends itself to ambiguous interpretation. Take, for example, two banks with the same capital/assets ratio [Gischer and Juttner, 2001]. [Methanuntakul, 2010] mention barriers for high-street fashion brands to build customer value and differentiate the core values of their brands from competitors because of imbalanced strategic communication implementation particularly in the encoding process, and ambiguous interpretation of target audience behaviour as a key disseminator of brand messages. [Lonkani et al, 2012] mention that communication leads to misunderstanding of effets. The effect of announcements on stock prices has a problem of distortion and ambiguous interpretation. Distortion of stock price when an announcement is made may due to a discretionary process of interpreting relevant information.\n2.3 Structuration ambiguities\nStatistics [Edwards, 1994] [Huang et al, 1991][Cacciola, et al, 2003] [Thompson and Geyer, 2007] [Le Duy et al, 2011] [Garcia et al, 1998] [Hanges et al, 2005] [McClelland et al, 2000] [Mair, 2007] [Pons, 2006] computer science [Tedeschi, 2006] [Niehaus and Terry,1993] [Jukic and Vrbsky, 1997] [MeyeriuDelius, 2009] [Shapiro et al, 1993] [Faconti et al, 2000] [Lucas et al, 2009][Stojanovic, 2005][Elfe et al, 1998][Vanackere, 2001] Linguistics [Gal et al, 2005][Rosen, 1991] [Tungsteth, 2003] [Obr\u0119bski and Stolarski, 2006] [Mayberry and Miikulainen, 1994] [Hagen, 2002] [Chung, 1998][Andrews et al,\n2011][Bouma et Hopp, 2006] [Fu et al, 2000]"}, {"heading": "Computation", "text": "Sometimes statistical assumptions are rarely satisfied, the null hypothesis tests give ambiguous results depending on the scatter of the data [Tedeschi, 2006]. Niehaus and Terry (1993) find the regression coefficients of lagged surplus variables on premiums have opposite signs for one and two periods. Sometimes data (tuples in databases) needs comparison with others tuples to precise their meanings [Jukic and Vrbsky, 1997] [Lucas et al, 2009]. Situation Recognition for Vehicular Traffic Scenarios, dealing with temporal contexts induces imprecises interpretations [Meyer-Delius, 2009]. [Shapiro et al, 1993] points out that IDEF (Icam DEFinition for Function Modeling) may be irrelevant. Arrows may join. A join represents fan-in or merging. The relatively unrestricted branch and join structure of arrows combined with their ambiguous interpretation lead to the major obstacle in using IDEF to describe the behavior of a system. [Faconti et al, 2000] specified inter-sensory interaction to avoid ambiguous interpretation of scenes within virtual environments. Because a query of keywords is unprecise [Stojanovic, 2005] precise that the user has to do an additional processing of the list of results in order to find some useful results. Interactions in telephony, (by extension in collborative work), calls involving multiple callers and features are susceptible to certain types of interaction inducing ambiguous signal interpretation or mistaken roles of callers. The reason for these types of interaction are the various and different contexts created by the activation of each new feature and by the inclusion of each new caller into the call [Elfe et al, 1998]. [Vanackere, 2001] imagined an ambiguity-adaptive logic for the creation of new collective theories. At an early stage of the construction of a theory, the domain specific terms are unavoidably vague or ambiguous. Still, the creation of the theory will never take of, if the scholars (who belong to one group) do not assume that all of them use the terms they use in a common way."}, {"heading": "Statistics", "text": "Validity of differences scores confounds the effets of their component measures, and failure to explain variance beyond their component measures [Edwards, 1994]. Confusion in endogenous switching regression model specifications can cause problems of interpretation [Huang et al, 1991]. Inspection of the vibrational response of a beam with an edge nonpropagating crack by means of stochastic analysis lead to uncertainty. When the breach is small, this is revealed by numerical applications which seems unable to give any information on the position of the crack [Cacciola, 2003]. [Thompson and Geyer, 2007] underlines that conventional p-values have ambiguous interpretation unless they are extreme. Two major risk areas with any and all stochastic estimating processes are identified as the unreliability of the estimates, and the ambiguous interpretation [Pons, 2006]. Striving for nonredundant predictor variables or using orthogonal contrasts greatly reduces the need for larger sample sizes to achieve adequate statistical power. The reduced redundancy also allows a less, but still, ambiguous interpretation of a variable's effect [McClelland et al, 2000]. [Mair, 2007] explain that in models considered as the family of nonstandard log-linear models it can arise an ambiguous interpretation of parameters. [Hanges et al, 2005] describes ambiguity about intra-\nclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) as an index of homogeneity is precisely because ICCs can increase by either increases in within-group homogeneity or by increases in betweengroup differences. It was found that the observation of ST deviations in the standard EGG may lead to ambiguous interpretation and that limiting observation to ST-T patterns alone instead of including QRS changes further hampers correct identification of the occluded vessel [Garcia et al, 1998]. According [Le Duy et al, 2011] in PRA for NNP there is still an ambiguous interpretation of the point estimate which is used to represent statistic quantity of log-normal distribution.\nlinguistic ambiguities Diversity of concepts describing the meaning of data in data sources (for example, database schemata, extensible markup language [XML] document-type definitions [DTDs]) is commonly known as semantic heterogeneity a well-known obstacle to da-ta source integration [Gal et al, 205]. In languages, for instance for Catalan, in the heavy construction, clauses verbs are may denote independent motion or not [Rosen, 1991]. In Norvegian, since instrumentals can either precede or follow directional prepositional phrases, but must precede locative prepositional phrases (PP), an instrumental PP preceding the i-PP (locative preposition i) should result in an ambiguous interpretation of the sentence [Tungsteth, 2003]. Ambiguous annotation may result from ambiguous segmentation [Obr\u0119bski and Stolarski, 2006]. [Mayberry and Miikulainen, 1994] have noticed that frequency-based mechanism alone is insufficient to explain all of lexical disambiguation. Rather, it suggests how disambiguation might occur at its most basic, subconscious level alluded to in the introduction. This process should be distinguished from what can be called pragmatic disambiguation, which requires higher-level inferencing. [Hagen, 2002] shows that pattern descriptions are unprecise and therefore ambiguous. She preconized to adopt a standard notation to specify patterns. [Chung, 1998] noticed than in Korean, in general, the greater the likelihood of ambiguous interpretation, the more difficult it is to switch the word order of two NPs. [Andrews et al, 2011] point out polysemic issue of annotation tagging. For instance, the tag \u201cJava\u201d may be used to describe a resource about the Java island or a resource about the Java programming language ; thus, users looking for resources related to the programming language may also get some irrelevant resources related to the Island (therefore, reducing the precision); [Bouma and Hopp]describe ambiguous problem in anaphoric interpretation. The pronoun sie can be ambiguous; interpretation is readily available. In other words, preferences for either interpretation are not categorical; rather, they reflect tendencies potentially based on factors like grammatical function or linear order. [Fu et al, 2000] describes Chinese lexical ambiguities as (1) word segmentation ambiguity, (2) part-of-speech ambiguity and (3) pronunciation ambiguity (viz. the problem of polyphonic words)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Discussion", "text": "In this chapter, we follow the idea of the first chapter to draw up where ambiguity and source of confusion is contained in data. Lots of sciences, producing information and data may induce an expert in a confusing position to offer a precise interpretation. We cited for each science a pool of studies which is only representative, but not exhaustive, of occuring problems. For ambiguities in texts the two effects of misinterpretation and erroneous results can play an important role."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we present two sources of contradictions occurring in text data. The first one is purely syntactic related to the writer\u2019s intention in its article. The second one is related factual data, obtained from experiments, and leading to elementary basis of interpretation. Goal of the\npaper influence how an article is written. When intention of the writer is ethically related to scientific concern of truth, am\u00f9biguity relied only on difficulties to obtain unambiguous fact data from experiments entached by noise or lack of up-to-date cataegories to help interpretation. When intention of a writer is motivated by its carreer and reputation improvement, data is not central playing role but only rethorical discourse of the writer, leading to improper relations but explained in a same way as real facts. In this study we tried to point out source of uncertainty to interpret relashionship in data. We did not propose a controlled process to substract noise from data; leaving out bad intention of a writer or uncertainty of data leading to contradictory interpretation. It should be a serious issue to make a corpus cleaner for concept and name entity extraction, and their relationships."}], "references": [{"title": "Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules", "author": ["R Agrawal", "R Srikant"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Agrawal and Srikant,? \\Q1994\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Agrawal and Srikant", "year": 1994}, {"title": "On the formulation of interpretations", "author": ["Allegro LA"], "venue": "Int J Psychoanal", "citeRegEx": "LA.,? \\Q1990\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "LA.", "year": 1990}, {"title": "Semantic Disambiguation in Folksonomy: A Case Study, Advanced Language", "author": ["Strasbourg", "P. 2003 Andrews", "J.

Main questions are how to get data and transform them into a good document format. But data can be sensitive to noise oftenly called ambiguities. Ambiguities are aware from a long time, mainly because polysemy is obvious in language and context is required to remove uncertainty. I claim in this paper that syntactic context is not suffisant to improve interpretation. In this paper I try to explain that firstly noise can come from natural data themselves, even involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified but meaningless, can spoil content of a corpus; it may lead to contradictions and background noise. keywords paradox ; contradiction ; ambiguity ; semantic relationship ; domain ; information extraction ; corpus INTRODUCTION Human cognition call a diversity of concepts such as memory and brain anatomy, inference and reasoning, motivation, time and space, classification and clustering. Inference tries to identify good relations or properties associated to an object. In this sense it is also possible to test validity or consistency of a relation. Let be the proposition P = \u201ca cat is a stone\u201d is false or contradictory because a stone is not a living organism, though a cat is a living organism. P can be called paradoxal or contradictory. Sometimes society lives with contradictions such as tolerance to lots of death on roads or in wars but intolerance for death with diseases. In this paper we more specifically focuse on sources of potential contradictions which could spoil computation of information extraction. Formal semantics is attached to validate relations between a set of objects. Our focuse is not only to study issues is managing complexity of a logical proposition and how to compute if it true or false but given a text consisting of a set of sentences how to extract relations and see how they be asserted as non contradictory regards others relations extracted in others texts. So texts are the primary material of discussion. Chapter 1 presents relational ambiguities we can find in texts. We start to present a typology of logical relations. Given a type of relations, we explain how to extract such relations with markers in texts. But markers are not sufficient to detect a contradiction. A specialized language such as molecular corpus gives example of ambiguous relations (contradictory) that can not be detected with markers. Hence we show that global overview of words collocations in a corpuscan give a good signal about the structure. In our \u201cpublish or publish\u201d new era of research and development system, production of literature is high but a non-negligible percent of papers becomes false over time. It is possible to compile from Pubmed website 4,800 papers honestly accepted but hence officially retracted. Such amount of information is original to make a corpus of real texts, written with intentional to propose arguments and content to readers, in a real natural language, but knowing that the content has been invalidated ex-post by readers. To build a random text is quite easy but the grammar and arguments will not be normalized by how argumentation is made usually by \u201cnormal writers and experts\u201d, or natural language will not confirm standard used of official grammars and", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
