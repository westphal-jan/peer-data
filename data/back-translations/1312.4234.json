Preliminaries", "text": "To facilitate our discussion, some fundamental concepts related to covering-based rough sets, graphs and matroids are reviewed in this section.\n2.1. Covering-based rough sets\nAs a generalization of a partition, the covering has more applicability and universality. To begin with, the concept of covering is introduced.\nDefinition 1. (Covering [13]) Let U be a universe of discourse and C a family of subsets of U . If none of the subsets in C are empty and \u22c3 C = U , then C is called a covering of U and the pair (U,C) is called a covering approximation space.\nAs the two key concepts of covering-based rough sets, the lower and upper approximation operators are defined to describe objects.\nDefinition 2. (Approximation operators [8]) Let C be a covering of U and X \u2286 U . The covering upper and lower approximations of X , denoted by C(X) and C(X), respectively, are defined as:\nC(X) = \u22c3 {K \u2208 C : K \u22c2 X 6= \u2205}, C(X) = C(Xc)c,\nwhere Xc denotes the complement of X in U .\nImmediately following the above definition, certain properties of the covering upper approximation operator are presented, while the corresponding properties of the covering lower one can be obtained by the duality property.\nProposition 1. [8] Let C be a covering of U . The operator C has the following properties: (1) C(\u2205) = \u2205 (Normality). (2) C(U) = U (Co-normality). (3) For all X \u2286 U , X \u2286 C(X) (Extension). (4) For all X,Y \u2286 U , C(X \u22c3 Y ) = C(X) \u22c3 C(Y ) (Additivity). (5) If X \u2286 Y \u2286 U , then C(X) \u2286 C(Y ) (Monotonicity).\n2.2. Graphs\nGraphs are discrete structures to model the correlation between data. Theoretically, a graph is a pair G = (V,E) comprising a set V of vertices and a set E of edges [11]. Generally, we write V (G) for V and E(G) for E, particularly when several graphs are considered. Each element of E(G) has either one or two vertices associated with it, called its endpoints. Through endpoints, the relationship between vertices and edges can be established by the form of matrices, namely incidence matrices. LetG = (V,E) be a graph with V = {v1, v2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vn} and E = {e1, e2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , em}. The incidence matrix I(G) of the graph is the n \u00d7 m matrix in which entry mij is 1 if vi is an endpoint of ej and otherwise is 0.\nThe edges in a graph may be directed or undirected. If any edge of the graph is undirected, we say the graph is an undirected graph. In this case, we write e = uv or e = vu for an edge e with endpoints u and v. In a graph G, two vertices are adjacent if there is an edge that has them as endpoints. An isolated vertex is a vertex not adjacent to any other vertices. If an edge links the same two endpoints, the edge is called a loop, and if there are edges having the same pair of endpoints, they are called multiple edges. A simple graph is a graph without loops or multiple edges. If the graph is simple and the vertices of it are pairwise adjacent, it is called the complete graph. A subgraph of the graph G is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of G. The subgraph induced by a subset of vertices K \u2286 V (G) is called a vertex-induced subgraph of G, and denoted by GK . This subgraph has vertex set K, and its edge set E\n\u2032 \u2286 E(G) consists of those edges from E(G) that have both their endpoints in K.\nExample 1. Let G = (V,E) be a graph as given in (I) of Figure 1. Suppose K = {b, c, d}. Then the vertex-induced subgraph GK is shown in (III) of Figure 1.\nA path of a graph G is a list v0v1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vk of distinct vertices such that, for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, vi\u22121vi is an edge of G, and a (u, v)\u2212path is a path and has first vertex u and last vertex v.\nA graph G is connected if for every pair of distinct vertices u and v, there is a path connecting both. If G has a (u, v)\u2212path, then u is connected to v. The connection relation on V (G) consists of the order pairs (u, v) such that u is connected to v. It was noted in [11] that the connection relation is an equivalence relation on V (G). Suppose the equivalence classes of the relation are V1, V2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Vs. Then the vertex-induced subgraphs GV1 , GV2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , GVs are called the connected components of the graph. The number of the connected components of graph G is denoted by \u03c9(G).\n2.3. Matroids\nMatroid theory borrows extensively from the terminology of graph theory, largely because it is an abstraction of various notions of central importance in the field, such as independent sets and circuits. The following definition of matroids is presented in terms of circuits.\nProposition 2. (Circuit axiom [6]) Let C be a family of subsets of U . There exists a matroid M such that C = C(M) if and only if C satisfies the following conditions: (C1) \u2205 /\u2208 C. (C2) For all C1, C2 \u2208 C, if C1 \u2286 C2, then C1 = C2. (C3) For all C1, C2 \u2208 C, if C1 6= C2 and x \u2208 C1 \u22c2 C2, then there exists C3 \u2208 C such\nthat C3 \u2286 C1 \u22c3 C2 \u2212 {x}.\nIf the family C of subsets of U satisfies the circuit axiom, then the members of C are called the circuits of M and U is called the ground set of M . We often write C(M) for C and U(M) for U , particularly when several matroids are being considered. For a matroid M , if C \u2208 C(M) and C = {x}, we say x is a loop of the matroid. If C(M) dose not contain any single-point set, the matroid is loopless. By the family of circuits, the connected matroids are defined. For any two elements e, f of U(M), define the relation \u03b3 of U(M) by e\u03b3f if and only if e = f or M has a circuit containing e and f . In [6], it was indicated that the relation \u03b3 is an equivalence relation. For any e \u2208 U(M), the \u03b3\u2212equivalence class \u03b3(e) = {e} \u22c3 {f \u2208 U(M) : M has circuit containing e and f} is called a connected component of M . If M has only one connected component U(M), we call M is connected; Otherwise M is disconnected. In fact, we can also describe the connected graph by the following proposition.\nProposition 3. [6] The matroidM is connected if and only if, for every pair of distinct elements of U(M), there is a circuit containing both."}, {"heading": "3. The study of the connectedness of graph through covering-based rough sets", "text": "Connected graphs are important discrete structures. Problems in many fields can be addressed using the graph models. In this section, we apply the covering-based rough sets to study the issue of the connection in a graph. Considering the matrix is related significantly to the theory, the incidence matrices of a graph are also borrowed to study the issue.\nIn this subsection, we present certain approaches to judging whether a graph is connected or not through covering approximation operators. For this purpose, we need to establish a relationship between a graph and a covering. In [10], it proposed the following approach to converting a graph to a covering.\nDefinition 3. Let G = (V,E) be an undirected simple graph. One can define a family F (G) of subsets of V as follows: For all u, v \u2208 V ,\n{u, v} \u2208 F (G)\u21d4 uv \u2208 E.\nDefinition 3 indicates that a graph can be represented by a family of subsets of its vertices. However, the family may not be a covering of the vertex set.\nExample 2. Let G = (V,E) be the graph as given in (I) of Figure 1 where V = {a, b, c, d, e} and E = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5}. By Definition 3, we know F (G) = {{a, b},\n{a, c}, {b, c}, {c, d}, {d, a}} and it is not a covering of V because there does not exist any edge to connect with the vertex e.\nIn fact, the type of graph which can induce a covering was also embodied in [10].\nProposition 4. Let G = (V,E) be an undirected simple graph. The family F (G) is a covering of V if and only if G has no isolated vertices.\nTherefore, the graphs studied in this section are undirected, simple and without isolated vertices unless otherwise specified. For the type of graph G, we denote the covering induced from it by C(G). First, the connection of any pair of distant vertices of the graph is studied by the covering.\nProposition 5. Let G = (V,E) be a graph and u, v be two distinct vertices of V . The vertex u is connected to v if and only if {u, v} \u2208 C(G) or there exists {K1,K2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Kn} \u2286 C(G) satisfying u \u2208 K1, v \u2208 Kn and Ki \u22c2 Ki+1 6= \u2205 for any i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n\u2212 1.\nPROOF. (\u201c \u21d2 \u201d): If u and v are adjacent, then {u, v} \u2208 C(G). If u is connected to v but they are not adjacent, then there exists a (u, v)\u2212path u1u2u3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7un\u22121un un+1, where u = u1 and v = un+1. Let Ki = {ui, ui+1} for any i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7n. It is clear that {K1,K2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Kn} \u2286 C(G). And u \u2208 K1, v \u2208 Kn and Ki \u22c2 Ki+1 6= \u2205 for any\ni = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n\u2212 1 because ui+1 \u2208 Ki \u22c2 Ki+1.\n(\u201c \u21d0 \u201d): For u, v \u2208 V , if {u, v} \u2208 C(G), then u and v are adjacent. If there exists {K1,K2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Kn} \u2286 C(G) satisfying u \u2208 K1, v \u2208 Kn and Ki \u22c2 Ki+1 6= \u2205\nfor any i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 1, then let ui \u2208 Ki \u22c2 Ki+1 where i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 1. Then there exists a list u0u1u2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7un\u22121un connecting u and v, where u0 = u and un = v. If there exist i, j \u2208 {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n} (we may as well suppose i < j) such that ui = uj , then delete the the vertices ui+1, ui+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7uj of the list. Finally, we can obtain a (u, v)\u2212path. Therefore u is connected to v.\nBased on the above proposition, an equivalent characterization for connected graph is established in terms of the covering induced by the graph.\nTheorem 1. LetG = (V,E) be a graph. The graph is connected if and only if, for any pair of distinct vertices u and v of V , {u, v} \u2208 C(G) or there exists {K1,K2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Kn} \u2286 C(G) satisfying u \u2208 K1, v \u2208 Kn and Ki \u22c2 Ki+1 6= \u2205 for any i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n\u2212 1.\nPROOF. It is straightforward from Proposition 5 and the definition of connected graphs.\nExample 3. Let G = (V,E) be the graph as given in (II) of Figure 1 where V = {a, b, c, d} and E = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5}. Then the covering induced by G is C(G) = {K1, K2, K3, K4, K5}, where K1 = {a, b}, K2 = {a, c}, K3 = {b, c}, K4 = {c, d} and K5 = {d, a}. For the pair of distinct vertices b and d of V , there exists {K3,K4} \u2286 C(G) satisfying b \u2208 K3 and d \u2208 K4 and K3 \u22c2 K4 6= \u2205, thus b is connected to d. In the same way, we find that, for any two distinct vertices of V , they are connected, i.e., G is a connected graph.\nIn fact, utilizing Theorem 1, the connected graphs can also be characterized equivalently from the viewpoint of the covering upper approximation operator.\nTheorem 2. LetG = (V,E) be a graph. The graph is connected if and only if, for any \u2205 6= X \u2282 V , C(G)(X) 6= X .\nPROOF. (\u201c \u21d2 \u201d) : Since C(G)(\u2205) = \u2205, we need to prove only the result: \u2200 \u2205 6= X \u2286 V , if C(G)(X) = X , then X = V . Pitch u \u2208 X . For all v \u2208 V \u2212 {u}, if {u, v} \u2208 C(G), then v \u2208 {u, v} \u2286 C(G)(X) = X which implies V \u2212 {u} \u2286 X . If u and v are not adjacent, then there exists {K1,K2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Kn} \u2286 C(G) satisfying u \u2208 K1, v \u2208 Kn and Ki \u22c2 Ki+1 6= \u2205 for any i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n\u2212 1. Since u \u2208 K1 \u22c2 X ,\nK1 \u2286 C(G)(X) = X . Because K2 \u22c2 K1 6= \u2205, K2 \u2286 C(G)(K1). Combining with the monotonicity of C(G), we have K2 \u2286 C(G)(K1) \u2286 C(G)(C(G)(X)) = C(G)(X) = X . In the same way, we can obtain v \u2208 Kn \u2286 X , then V \u2212 {u} \u2286 X . Since u \u2208 X , V \u2286 X . Combining with X \u2286 V , then X = V .\n(\u201c \u21d0 \u201d): For all u \u2208 V , let Pu = {v \u2208 V : v is connected to u}. Then Pu 6= \u2205 because u \u2208 Pu. Next, we want to prove C(G)(Pu) = Pu. For all v \u2208 C(G)(Pu), there exists K \u2208 C(G) such that v \u2208 K and K \u22c2 Pu 6= \u2205. We may as well suppose\nw \u2208 K \u22c2 Pu, then v is connected to w and w is connected to u, thus v is connected to u, i.e., v \u2208 Pu. Thus C(G)(Pu) \u2286 Pu. Utilizing the extension of C(G), we have Pu \u2286 C(G)(Pu). Then C(G)(Pu) = Pu. By assumption, we know Pu = V . Therefore G is connected.\nGiven a covering approximation space (U,C), for all X \u2286 U , if C(X) = X , the set X is called an outer definable set. From the viewpoint, Theorem 2 indicates that a graph is connected if and only if the covering approximation space induced by the graph has no non-empty outer definable proper subset.\nBy the duality, the connected graph characterized by the covering lower approximation operator is presented as follows.\nCorollary 1. Let G = (V,E) be a graph. The graph is connected if and only if, for any \u2205 6= X \u2282 V , C(X) 6= X .\nExample 4. Let G = (V,E) be the graph as given in (II) of Figure 1. By simple computing, the outer definable subsets of covering approximation space (V,C(G)) are \u2205 and V . Hence G is connected."}, {"heading": "4. An application to connected matroids", "text": "As is known, when the matroid is the cycle matroid induced by a graph, the matroid and the graph have the same connectedness. However, for a given matroid, it may not be the cycle matroid of some graph. Therefore, using cycle matroids to study the connectedness of matroids may not be effective. In this section, we propose an approach to induce a graph from an arbitrary matroid. It is interesting that the graph and the matroid have the same connectedness. Therefore, the covering-based rough sets are used to study the connection of the matroid. First, the method to convert a matroid to a graph is presented as follows.\nDefinition 4. LetM be a matroid. One can define an undirected simple graphG(M) = (V,E) as follows: (1) V = U(M). (2) For any u, v \u2208 V and u 6= v, uv \u2208 E \u21d4 \u2203C \u2208 C(M) s.t. {u, v} \u2286 C.\nRemark 1. Once matroid M has loops, the graph G(M) has isolated vertices.\nExample 5. Let M be a matroid with U(M) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and C(M) = {{1, 2, 3}, {6}, {2, 4, 5}, {1, 3, 4, 5}}. The graph induced by the matroid M is given in Figure 2.\nIn fact, the connectedness of the graph induced by a matroid is closely related to that of the matroid. First, the equivalent characterization for the connection of any pair of distinct vertices of the graph is presented through the circuits of the matroid.\nLemma 1. [6] Let M be a matroid and C1, C2 \u2208 C(M). If e1 \u2208 C1 \u2212C2, e2 \u2208 C2 \u2212 C1 and C1 \u22c2 C2 6= \u2205, then there exists C3 \u2208 C(M) such that e1, e2 \u2208 C3 \u2286 C1 \u22c3 C2.\nProposition 6. Let M be a matroid and u, v a pair of distinct vertices of U(M). The vertex u is connected to v in graph G(M) if and only if there exists C \u2208 C(M) such that {u, v} \u2286 C.\nPROOF. The sufficiency is straightforward. Next, we prove the necessity. Since u is connected to v in graph G(M), there exists the shortest (u, v)\u2212path, let us assume the length is n. We conclude that n = 1. Otherwise, we may well suppose the path is u1u2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7un+1, where u1 = u, un+1 = v, and n \u2265 2. Since u1u2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7un+1 is a path, there exist C1, C2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Cn \u2208 C(M) such that {ui, ui+1} \u2286 Ci for all i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n. Thus u \u2208 C1, v \u2208 Cn and Ci \u22c2 Ci+1 6= \u2205 for all i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 1. Because the path is the shortest, the circuits C1, C2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Cn are different, and u /\u2208 Cj for all j = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n, and v /\u2208 Cj for all j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 1. As u \u2208 C1 \u2212 C2, according to (C2) of the circuit axiom, we know there exists v1 \u2208 C2 \u2212 C1. Combining with C1 \u22c2 C2 6= \u2205 and Lemma 1, there exists C \u2032 1 \u2208 C(M) such that {u, v1} \u2286 C \u2032\n1 \u2286 C1 \u22c3 C2. Since v1 \u2208 C2, if v1 /\u2208 C3, then v1 \u2208 C2 \u2212 C3. Utilizing (C2) of the\ncircuit axiom, there exists v2 \u2208 C3 \u2212 C2. According to Lemma 1 and C2 \u22c2 C3 6= \u2205, there exists C \u2032 2 \u2208 C(M) such that {v1, v2} \u2286 C \u2032 2 \u2286 C2 \u22c3 C3. If v1 \u2208 C3, then we take C \u2032 2 = C3. It is clear that C \u2032 1 \u22c2 C \u2032 2 6= \u2205 because v1 \u2208 C \u2032 1 \u22c2 C \u2032\n2. In the same way, we can obtain C \u2032 1, C \u2032 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , C \u2032 n\u22121 \u2208 C(M) such that u \u2208 C \u2032 1, v \u2208 C \u2032\nn\u22121 and C \u2032\ni\n\u22c2 C \u2032\ni+1 6= \u2205 for all i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 2. Furthermore, v /\u2208 C \u2032\nj for all j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7n \u2212 2. If there exits j \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 2} such that v \u2208 C \u2032j , then v \u2208 C \u2032j \u2286 Cj \u22c3 Cj+1, i.e., v \u2208 Cj or v \u2208 Cj+1 which contradicts that v /\u2208 Cj for all j \u2264 n \u2212 1. Similarly, for all j = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 1, u /\u2208 C \u2032j . Thus we have C \u2032 1 6= C \u2032 n\u22121. However, the circuits C \u2032 1, C \u2032 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , C \u2032\nn\u22121 may not be all different. Therefore, we reduce the circuits by the following step. If there exist two distinct numbers i, j of {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 1} such that C \u2032i = C \u2032\nj (we may as well suppose i < j), then remove the circuits C \u2032\ni+1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , C \u2032\nj . By the step, we can obtain the family of circuits {C \u2032s1 , C \u2032 s2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , C \u2032 st}(\u2286 {C \u2032 1, C \u2032 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , C \u2032\nn\u22121}) whose elements are different and satisfy the condition: u \u2208 C \u2032s1 , v \u2208 C \u2032 st and Csi \u22c2 Csi+1 6= \u2205 for all i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , t\u2212 1. It is clear that s1 = 1, st = n \u2212 1, u /\u2208 C \u2032 sj for all j = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , t and v /\u2208 C \u2032 sj for all j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 t \u2212 1. For the circuits C \u2032s1 , C \u2032 s2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , C \u2032\nst , repeat the above discussion. Finally, we can obtain two circuits Cu and Cv such that u \u2208 Cu \u2212 Cv , v \u2208 Cv \u2212 Cu and Cu \u22c2 Cv 6= \u2205. Utilizing Lemma 1, there exists C \u2208 C(M) such that\n{u, v} \u2286 C \u2286 Cu \u22c3 Cv , i.e., uv \u2208 E(G(M)) which implies n = 1. It contradicts the assumption that n \u2265 2. Hence the result has been proved.\nRemark 2. Any connected component of the graph G(M) is an isolated vertex or a complete graph. Once the graph is connected, it is a completed graph.\nBy the above proposition, the relationship between the connectedness of a matroid and that of the graph induced by the matroid can be embodied. We find that they have the same connectedness.\nTheorem 3. Let M be a matroid. The graph G(M) is connected if and only if the matroid M is connected.\nPROOF. According to Proposition 3 and 6, G(M) is connected\u21d4 for any two distant vertices u and v of V (G(M)), u is connected to v\u21d4 for any two distant vertices u and v of U(M), there exists C \u2208 C(M) such that {u, v} \u2286 C \u21d4M is connected.\nNow that a matroid and the graph induced by the matroid have the same connectedness, if the graph has isolated vertices, then the matroid is disconnected. From Example 5, we find that whether the graph has isolated vertices or not is not only determined by the loops of the matroid. Indeed, it also has a relation with the other circuits of the matroid.\nProposition 7. Let M be a matroid. The graph G(M) has no isolated vertices if and only if M is loopless and C(M) is a covering of U(M).\nPROOF. (\u201c \u21d0 \u201d): If u is an isolated vertex of G(M), then for all v \u2208 U(M) \u2212 {u}, there does not exist C \u2208 C(M) such that {u, v} \u2286 C. Thus there exists C \u2208 C(M) such that C = {u} or there does not exist C \u2208 C(M) such that u \u2208 C, which contradicts the assumption thatM is loopless and C(M) is a covering of U(M), respectively.\n(\u201c\u21d2 \u201d): It is clear that G(M) has no isolated vertices implies that M is loopless. Next, we need to prove C(M) is a covering of U(M). According to the circuit axiom, we know \u2205 /\u2208 C(M). For all u \u2208 U(M), there exists an element of U(M) which is different from u such that u is connected to v. Utilizing Proposition 6, there exists Cu \u2208 C(M) such that u \u2208 Cu. Thus U(M) = \u22c3 u\u2208U(M){u} \u2286 \u22c3 u\u2208U(M) Cu \u2286\u22c3\nC(M) \u2286 U(M), i.e., U(M) = \u22c3 C(M). Therefore C(M) is a covering of U(M).\nNext, we pay our attention to the connectedness of the matroid whose induced graph has no isolated vertices. In this part, we introduce the approaches proposed in Section 3 to study the issue. As is known, a graph without isolated vertices can induce a covering through Definition 3. Combining with Proposition 7, we know for a matroid M , when the graphG(M) has no isolated vertices, there are two coverings of its vertex set, i.e. C(M) and C(G(M)). Generally, these two coverings are different, but they can induce the same covering upper approximation operator.\nLemma 2. Let M be a matroid. If graph G(M) has no isolated vertices, then for all X \u2286 U(M), C(G(M))(X) = C(M)(X).\nPROOF. Since G(M) has no isolated vertices, the families C(G(M)) and C(M) are two coverings of U(M). Thus C(G(M)) and C(M) are two covering upper approximation operators of U(M), respectively. Next, we prove these two operators are equal. For all x \u2208 C(G(M))(X), there exists K \u2208 C(G(M)) such that x \u2208 K and K \u22c2 X 6= \u2205. If x \u2208 X , then x \u2208 C(M)(X) because X \u2286 C(M)(X). If\nx /\u2208 X , pitch y \u2208 K \u22c2 X , then x 6= y and K = {x, y}, i.e., x is connected to y. According to Proposition 6, there exists C \u2208 C(M) such that {x, y} \u2286 C which implies that x \u2208 C(M)(X). Hence C(G(M))(X) \u2286 C(M)(X). Conversely, for any x \u2208 C(M)(X), there exists C \u2208 C(M) such that x \u2208 C and C \u22c2 X 6= \u2205. If x \u2208 X ,\nthen x \u2208 C(G(M))(X) because X \u2286 C(G(M))(X). If x /\u2208 X , pitch y \u2208 C \u22c2 X , then x 6= y and {x, y} \u2286 C, i.e., x and y are adjacent in graph G(M). Thus {x, y} \u2208 C(G(M)) which implies x \u2208 C(G(M))(X). Hence C(M)(X) \u2286 C(G(M))(X).\nTherefore, the connectedness for the matroid, whose induced graph has no isolated vertices, can be characterized by the circuit covering.\nTheorem 4. Let M be a loopless matroid and the circuit family C(M) a covering of U(M). The following statements are equivalent: (1) M is connected. (2) For any \u2205 6= X \u2282 U(M), C(M)(X) 6= X . (3) For any x \u2208 U(M), C(M)(x) = U(M).\nPROOF. (1) \u21d4 (2): M is connected if and only if G(M) is connected if and only if, for all \u2205 6= X \u2282 U(M), C(G(M))(X) 6= X if and only if, for all \u2205 6= X \u2282 U(M), C(M)(X) 6= X .\n(1) \u21d4 (3): M is connected if and only if G(M) is a complete graph if and only if, for all x \u2208 U(M), C(G(M))(x) = U(M) if and only if, for all x \u2208 U(M), C(M)(x) = U(M).\nFrom the above discussion, there are three steps to determine the connectedness of a matroid M . Step 1: Judge whether M has loops or not. Step 2: Judge whether or not C(M) is a covering of U(M). Step 3: If the matroid has no loops and its circuit family forms a covering of its ground set, then utilize Theorem 4 to determine the connectedness of it."}, {"heading": "5.
