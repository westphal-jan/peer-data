INTRODUCTION\nIn many problems of information fusion, there is a need to allow for the reliability of a source [1]. The meta-knowledge about the reliability can be only source-dependent, but it can as well vary for different types of evidence. While the first case is easily handled by classical discounting operation [2], the second one is more complex and existing solutions do not meet all possible use cases [3], [4]. In this article, we address this problem in the context of the theory of belief functions, also known as Dempster\u2013Shafer theory [5], [2] by proposing three schemes for contextual discounting: conservative, proportional and optimistic.\nThe domain of information fusion concerns in great measure the combination of sensor data arriving successively with the passage of time. Past information is often useful and should not be discarded. However, one cannot disregard the fact that the information may worth less and less over time. In order to handle this variation in subjective value of a piece of information, we apply proposed discounting operations to temporal discounting.\nThe closest work and the starting point for this article has been realised by Mercier et al. who presented the original idea of contextual discounting [6], [3]. This research has been further developed and generalised contextual discounting and\nreinforcement have been described as examples of correction mechanisms for belief functions [4], [7]. Pichon et al. devoted some research to the subject of information correction schemes by proposing a strategy taking into account the source\u2019s relevance and truthfulness [8]. Other mechanisms of data revision have been studied in the context of the evidence theory. A review of existing revision rules can be found in [9], along with an extension of one of them able to cope with inconsistency between prior and input information.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. The existing concepts of discounting in the theory of belief functions will first be recalled in Section II. Next, Section III will present the details of the proposed schemes. Rules\u2019 behaviour and their properties will be described in Section IV, while some simple examples will be given in Section V. A case study about the application of the proposed method to temporal discounting will be the subject of Section VI. We will conclude the paper and outline the perspectives for future research in Section VII."}, {"heading": "II. BELIEF FUNCTIONS THEORY", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A.

First and foremost, information source S is supposed to excessively encourage set of solutions A and, therefore, m(A) should be discounted by factor \u03b1A corresponding to A. The behaviour of the new discounting operation should be close to the behaviour of classical discounting. Mass of conflict m(\u2205) shall get discounted and new schemes should generalise the classical one. Moreover, setting a non-zero discount factor for set \u03b8 should entail the discounting of mass attributed to \u03b8, whereas masses of sets having no elements in common with \u03b8 should rest unchanged1. Such a behaviour is opposite to contextual discounting proposed by Mercier et al. [6] that retains mass attributed to \u03b8 and discounts other sets, which we judge counter-intuitive especially in case of many classes, but welljustified and conform to the proposed interpretation (see [3, Example 2]). Finally, we postulate that discounted mass of set \u03b8 should be transferred to \u2126 and not to its other superset being a proper subset of \u2126, since doing so would imply additional knowledge about the state of the represented entity."}, {"heading": "A.

Conservative one that demonstrates very cautious or even overcautious behaviour which can be resumed as: in case of doubt, do not exclude any possibilities. Indeed, discounting all supersets in the same way as the set in question means that one accepts a possibility that mass of a superset (e.g. AB) corresponds entirely to one of its constituents (e.g. A), which, incidentally, has been overestimated and should hence be discounted. Conversely, when one assumes that mass of superset AB depends on a set that has not been excessively evaluated (B), optimistic discounting is used. Such a behaviour can be seen as optimistic or bold, because any doubt about whether to discount a particular set or not implies a negative answer.\nSince the above schemes are the extreme cases, a need of an inbetween solution appears naturally. A manner of performing this without recurring to mass-dependent computation is to ponder the discount rate by some measure of dependence between a set and it supersets.

For each \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126, a half-life time t1/2 is known:\nt1/2, C1 = [1, 4, 15] s (58) t1/2, C2 = [5, 4, 15] s (59)\nCase 1 can be interpreted as follows. Additional knowledge about source S is available and it states that classes \u03c91, \u03c92 and \u03c93 become obsolete with different rates. Namely, \u03c91 is known to be worth a half of its initial value4 after 1 second, \u03c92 and \u03c93 \u2014 after 4 s and 15 s respectively. Analogical interpretation should be given to Case 2 with the sole difference that the half-life period of class \u03c91 is longer and equal to 5 s.\nUsing Equation 39, decay parameters \u03bb are computed:\n\u03bbC1 \u2248 [0.6931, 0.1733, 0.0462] (60) \u03bbC2 \u2248 [0.1386, 0.1733, 0.0462] (61)\nThen, thanks to Equations 56 and 57, let compute parameters \u03ba and discount factor vector \u03b1 for instant t = 4 s:\n\u03baC1(t) \u2248 [0.0625, 0.5000, 0.8312] (62) \u03baC2(t) \u2248 [0.5743, 0.5000, 0.8312] (63)\n\u03b1C1 \u2248 [\u22121.5787, 0.6777, 0.8061] (64) \u03b1C2 \u2248 [0.1493, 0.0228, 0.4122] (65)\n7) Comment: The above steps demonstrate that the desired temporal discounting cannot be expressed in terms of contextual discounting as proposed in [6]. Indeed, \u03b1C1 contains a negative value, which is incompatible with this method and the outcome of such a discounting would not satisfy the condition of a mass function as in Equation 1.\n4 The word value corresponds to some subjective value of a piece of information from the point of view of the fusion system."}, {"heading": "C. Temporal discounting using proposed discounting schemes", "text": "On the contrary to contextual discounting, the proposed methods are expressive enough to reflect the desired behaviour of temporal discounting. Let us reuse the same two cases evoked in Section VI-B6. The computation of decay parameters \u03bb and \u03ba is common to both methods.

CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES", "text": "In this article, we have proposed and defined three types of contextual discounting: conservative, proportional and optimistic. These methods allow fine-grained modelling of the reliability of the sources. Moreover, the introduced techniques can be applied to temporal discounting which has been described as well. It has been demonstrated that the existing contextual discounting introduced by Mercier [3] is not strong enough to model temporal discounting.\nIn addition to the already given applications, the authors consider the use of temporal discounting in the context of intelligent transportation perception. Various object classes seen by a vehicle should not be forgotten at the same rate.\nFor instance, information about objects recognised as buildings shall be kept longer than static but possibly mobile objects. In turn, mobile static objects would persist longer than moving objects.\nAs a practical advantage, one can mention that for a given discount rate vector, factors by which masses are multiplied to obtain discounted mass function can be precomputed and stored for later use. The computational complexity of such an algorithm grows linearly with the size of the powerset 2\u2126 equally for time and space.\nIt would be interesting to automatically or semi-automatically define which type of discounting has to be used in particular situation. Moreover, a profound study of the properties of the proposed discounting rules seems to be significantly important. These tasks are left for future research."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work has been supported by the French Ministry of Defence DGA (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Armement) with a Ph.D. grant delivered to Marek Kurdej."}], "references": [{"title": "Data fusion in the Transferable Belief Model", "author": ["P.
