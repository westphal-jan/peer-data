INTRODUCTION\nToday computers play very important role in thedaily life of common people, and it is observedthat the use of computers in countries other than developing ones is substantial in every walk of life. It is a fact that the more the developing countries transform their systems to adapt the use of computers the more progress and development they would achieve and hence would reduce the so called gap of \u2018digital divide\u2019. The public use of computers, however, is some how dependent on the support for the regional languages of the countries.\nThere are thousands of languages being spoken throughout the world, and it has been noticed that the English speaking countries have an edge over other nations where English is not as their native language in use of computers. There are many countries which have\nadopted their native language in use of computers and succeeded to cope with computing problems. There are some countries where multiple languages are spoken such as India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. In Pakistan Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, Blochi and Siraiki etc. are spoken [1].\nSindhi is the official language of Sindh province of Pakistan and it is also one of the 22 constitutionally recognized languages of India. Sindhi is spoken by an estimated 34.4 million people in Pakistan (3rd most spoken language) and about 2.8 million people in India (majority of them being those who migrated from Sindh to India in the wave of the partition of the subcontinent in 1947). During and after the partition of the subcontinent many Sindhi families (both Hindu and Muslims) also moved abroad for permanent settlement in many countries across\nMEHRAN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY, VOLUME 30, NO. 4, OCTOBER, 2011 [ISSN 0254-7821] 663\n664 MEHRAN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY, VOLUME 30, NO. 4, OCTOBER, 2011 [ISSN 0254-7821]\nthe globe; thus forming a significant community of Sindhi diasporas [2].\nSindhi language is classified as an Indo-Aryan language belonging to Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. Though the original script of Sindhi language found in the remnants of Mohen-jo-Daro (illustrator of some 5000 bc Indus valley civilization) has yet not been interpreted, the preliminary system of writing appeared before 8th century AD (i.e. before the advent of Islam in Sindh in 711 AD). The contributions of Sufi poets like Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, Sachal Sarmast and Sami further popularized Sindhi language in literary circles in between 14th and 18th century [3]. Since this time, the literature in Sindhi language has grown significantly and currently Sindhi is being used as medium of instruction in Sindhi majority public sector schools of province of Sindh from primary to secondary level (matriculation). Dozens of daily Sindhi newspapers are being published along with several dedicated Sindhi TV channels. Besides this Sindhi is also one of the two languages used by Government of Pakistan to issue computerized national identity cards to its citizens.\nThough the proper use of Sindhi language in all of the above mentioned spheres requires its proper adaptation and progress in terms of modern computer based standards and models; however, too little work has yet been done for the standardization of Sindhi computing as well as development of computer based models of Sindhi script, speech and language [4]. The major issues in Sindhi computing as investigated and observed are due to the following reasons:\n(i) No localized Sindhi Software available.\n(ii) Non-availability of compatible Sindhi fonts for different operating systems with standard Unicode format.\n(iii) Complex process of enabling Sindhi through \u201cRegional and Language Settings\u201d.\n(iv) Non-compatibility of Sindhi keyboard layout for different operating systems.\n(v) Lack of computer literature and books in Sindhi.\n(vi) No educational programs in Sindhi Computing at School and College levels.\n(vii) Research activities at infancy in Sindhi computing.\n(viii) Communication and coordination gap among researchers and professionals etc.\nAs far as we know, so far, neither the provincial government of Sindh nor the federal government of Pakistan has initiated any significant project to fund the research on Sindhi language processing. Not only this but the complete failure of the government to control copy right system and eliminate the use of pirated software has also contributed to the lack of willingness of developers to commit any resources for the research and development of Sindhi language. As a result of this there are only a few legacy tools being used for Sindhi desktop publishing which vary from one publisher/individual to another publisher/individual. Almost all of these tools adapt English-based word processing systems and make use of their specific code pages (mostly based on ASCII scheme) for Sindhi character set. To the best of our knowledge, the development of a Sindhi-based GUI for the processing of Sindhi language has not yet been reported. This paper takes a step towards this aim and presents the design and development of a GUI for SL (Sindhi Language). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the background and motivation along with a thorough discussion of the major issues in terms of Sindhi computing and also in terms of the design of the GUISL; Section 3 presents the design and development of the GUISL and finally Section 4 concludes the paper with added description of the future work.\nMEHRAN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY, VOLUME 30, NO. 4, OCTOBER, 2011 [ISSN 0254-7821] 665"}, {"heading": "2. GUISL: DESIGN ISSUES", "text": "Historically, Sindhi language has adopted a variety of writing systems based on the innovations and preferences of particular regional communities. Most of the names of the ancient scripts are either based on the names of the cities/towns (e.g., Khudabadi, Thattai, etc.) or the names of the communities (e.g. Memonki, Luhaniki, Khojiki, Devnagri, Gurmukhi, Perso-Arabic etc.) [8]. During the colonial period, owing to the Sansakrit related nature of Sindhi, some British scholars advocated for the promotion of Devnagri script to be used for Sindhi. To this aim they managed to publish the translation of Bible and SindhiEnglish dictionary using Devnagri script in 1849- 1850 [10]. This move was opposed by some government employees who were only familiar with Perso-Arabic script and their side was backed by some British officials including Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton. The matter got referred to the Court of Directors of the British East India Company.\nBased on the fact that the Muslim names were not properly written with Devnagri, the use of the Perso-Arabic script was recommended by the court. Following this decision, a team of scholars including Sir Burton, Munshi Thanwardas and Mirza Sadiq Ali Beg worked on the standardization of Perso-Arabic based script for Sindhi language. The standardization of this script was completed in 1852 and it consisted of 52 letters derived from PersoArabic scripts with addition of dots and lines to fully represent all of the Sindhi sounds. This script is currently being used in Sindh and abroad and is based on Arabic Nashk style of writing [6,10-11]. Figs. 1-2 show the list of these characters.\nShort vowels and some additional vocalic and consonantal features are also represented through diacritical (Zeer, Zaber, Peush, etc.) marks in Sindhi [3,8] as listed in Fig. 3. The diacritics (also known as aerab) are optionally used in writing, however, for our system development they have not been used for the sake of simplicity and readability.\nThus, the design of GUISL involves numerous key factors that need to be addressed for designing the interface. Sindhi is written and read from right-to-left direction, therefore the system should have the ability to display text from right-to-left and everything of GUI (toolbar, status bar, writing direction, menus, tool tips, popup menus etc.) should be presented from right-to- left for accommodating the Sindhi users.\nAccording to the Unicode standard the characters should be inserted and stored in a simple logical sequence [5]. If we wish to write the word (Sindhi), the keys would be pressed in succession corresponding to the characters making up the word (Sindhi). The text file would store the Unicode codes of these characters in order as shown below.\nTo display the text in an appropriate order of Sindhi the system needs to correspond to each of the successive\n666 MEHRAN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY, VOLUME 30, NO. 4, OCTOBER, 2011 [ISSN 0254-7821]\ncode to be displayed in the right-to-left order however it would be displayed into left-to-right as shown below. This is what happens with Roman Script making it straight forward and simple to render [4-5,11].\nThus it needs reordering or grouping with one-to-many relationship between characters. As Sindhi language is a cursive like Arabic in its written format [6] the above text is unacceptable as neither the ordering is correct nor the shapes of the characters as per cursive nature of the script.\nThe system should be able to display Sindhi character properly with its cursive forms while ligature used to form Sindhi words. The development of the GUISL should provide easy access for ordinary user and without any additional requirements such as Sindhi Fonts, Keyboard Layout setup, Regional Language Setting etc. These design issues pose impediments in the development of the Sindhi software system."}, {"heading": "3. Design & development of the GUISL", "text": "Three major issues are analyzed to design and standardize the Sindhi user interface: Unicode of characters, keyboard layout, and Sindhi cursive form. Unfortunately, there is no ordering (sorting) of Sindhi Unicode characters in the Unicode plane and all the characters are scattered and mixed with Arabic and Farsi character set as shown in Fig. 4 (Sindhi characters are circled highlighting their positions in the plane). The absence of a sequence and segregated set of character coding leads to develop adhoc based systems for process of Sindhi computing. The first step involves changing the orientation of all the GUI elements (toolbar, status bar, writing direction, menus, tool tips, popup menus etc.) in system from right-to-left allowing the initial, middle and last representations of the characters to be rendered appropriately with proper cursive for the ligature to form the word [9]."}, {"heading": "3.1 Unicode Based Sindhi Characters Coding", "text": "A static class was created in Java language, declaring all the Unicode based Sindhi characters to be used in GUISL as shown in pseudo-code given in the Algorithm1.
