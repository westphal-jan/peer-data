Introduction", "text": "We are interested in modeling the belief change that is caused by executing an alternating sequence of actions and observations. Roughly, agents perform belief update following actions and agents perform belief revision following observations.

We illustrate that the belief change caused by this kind of alternating sequence can not simply be determined through a straightforward iteration of updates and revisions. The main issue is that there are plausible examples where an observation should lead an agent to revise the initial belief state, rather than the current belief state. Our goal is to provide a general methodology for computing iterated belief change due to alternating sequences of actions and observations."}, {"heading": "1.1 Contributions to Existing Research", "text": "This paper is an extension of our previous work (Hunter & Delgrande, 2005). Our focus is on action domains involving a single agent that can execute actions and make observations. It is assumed that every change in the state of the world is due to the execution of an action,\nc\u00a92011 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nand it is assumed that the set of available actions is given. In this context, there are two possible explanations for an erroneous belief. First, an erroneous belief can be due to an incorrect initial belief. Second, an erroneous belief can be due to the execution of a hidden exogenous action. We focus primarily on the first case, since we are explicitly concerned with a single agent scenario. We briefly describe the contributions that we make in the area of belief change caused by actions.\nOne contribution is that we explicitly specify precise properties that should hold whenever an action is followed by an observation. We state the properties in the style of the AGM postulates for belief revision (Alchourro\u0301n, Ga\u0308rdenfors, & Makinson, 1985), and we argue that the properties should hold in any action domain involving a single agent with perfect knowledge of the actions executed. The properties of iterated belief change that we specify are a natural generalization of the AGM postulates; as such, they can easily be justified for action domains involving a given AGM operator. We show that there are simple examples where it is clear that the action history plays a role in the interpretation of an observation. Therefore, it is necessary to formalize the role of the action history in determining the appropriate belief change. However, this problem has not been explicitly addressed in related work. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt at formally specifying any high-level interaction between belief update and belief revision caused by actions.\nAs a second contribution, we give a specific methodology for combining a belief update operator and a belief revision operator in a single formalism. In particular, we define a new class of belief change operators, called belief evolution operators. A belief evolution operator takes two arguments: a set of states and an alternating sequence of actions and observations. Each belief evolution operator \u25e6 is defined with respect to a fixed update operator and a fixed AGM revision operator \u2217. Informally, we have the following correspondence\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008A1, \u03b11, . . . , An, \u03b1n\u3009 \u2248 \u03ba A1 \u2217 \u03b11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 An \u2217 \u03b1n.\nThe basic idea is simply to translate all observations into conditions on the initial beliefs. In this manner, we can define an iterated belief change operator that respects our interaction properties and handles example problems appropriately.\nFormally, we demonstrate that our belief evolution operators can be characterized by a natural \u201cshifting\u201d on the underlying AGM revision operator. In this sense, we can view iterated belief change as a modified form of revision. From a more general perspective, the belief evolution methodology is useful for combining any action formalism with an AGM revision operator. Hence, we can view belief evolution as an improved methodology for adding a revision operator to an action formalism.\nThe third contribution of this work is that we provide a mechanism for evaluating the performance of existing epistemic action formalisms with regards to iterated belief change. It has been common in past work to extend an existing action formalism by simply adding a formal representation of knowledge or belief. This has been done, for example, in the action language A (Lobo, Mendez, & Taylor, 2001; Son & Baral, 2001) as well as the Situation Calculus (SitCalc) (Shapiro, Pagnucco, Lesperance, & Levesque, 2000). It is easy to see that the extensions of A fail to satisfy our interaction properties, and the sensing actions in the extended languages do not provide an appropriate model of iterated belief change. On the other hand, we suggest that the SitCalc does consider the action history appropriately. In\ngeneral, we argue that simply extending an action formalism with a belief revision operator is not sufficient. We show that such approaches either lack the formal machinery required for reasoning about iterated belief change, or they make substantive implicit assumptions. Our work illustrates the role that an action formalism plays in reasoning about belief change. It also becomes clear that additional assumptions must be made in order to reason about iterated belief change due to actions and observations. By making the role of the action formalism salient, we can better evaluate the suitability of existing formalisms for particular applications."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we introduce preliminary notation and definitions related to reasoning about action and reasoning about belief change. We also introduce a motivating example that will be used throughout the paper."}, {"heading": "2.1 Motivating Example", "text": "We introduce Moore\u2019s litmus paper problem (Moore, 1985) as a motivating example. In this problem, there is a beaker containing either an acid or a base, and there is an agent holding a piece of white litmus paper that can be dipped into the beaker to determine the contents. The litmus paper will turn red if it is placed in an acid and it will turn blue if it is placed in a base. The problem is to provide a formal model of the belief change that occurs when an agent uses the litmus paper to test the contents of the beaker.\nIntuitively, the litmus paper problem seems to require an agent to revise the initial beliefs in response to an observation at a later point in time. For example, suppose that the agent dips the paper and then sees that the paper turns red. This observation not only causes the agent to believe the beaker contains an acid now, but it also causes the agent to believe that the beaker contained an acid before dipping. We refer to this process as a prior revision, since the agent revises their beliefs at a prior point in time. This kind of phenomenon is not explicitly discussed in many formalisms for reasoning about belief change caused by action. We will return to this problem periodically as we introduce our formal approach to belief change."}, {"heading": "2.2 Basic Notation and Terminology", "text": "We assume a propositional signature composed of a finite set of atomic propositional symbols. We use the primitive propositional connectives {\u00ac,\u2192}, where \u00ac denotes classical negation and \u2192 denotes implication. Conjunction, disjunction and equivalence are defined in the usual manner, and they are denoted by \u2227, \u2228 and\u2261, respectively. A formula is a propositional combination of atomic symbols. A literal is either an atomic propositional symbol, or an atomic propositional symbol preceded by the negation symbol. Let Lits denote the set of all literals over the fixed signature.\nAn interpretation of a propositional signature P is a function that assigns every atomic symbol a truth value. The set of all interpretations over P is denoted by 2P. The satisfaction relation I |= \u03c6 is defined for formula \u03c6 by the usual recursive definition. For any formula\n\u03c6, we define |\u03c6| to be the set of all interpretations I such that I |= \u03c6, and we say that \u03c6 is satisfiable if and only if |\u03c6| 6= \u2205.\nA belief state is a subset of 2P. We can think of a belief state as expressing a proposition. Informally, an agent with belief state \u03ba believes that the actual world is represented by one of the interpretations in \u03ba. An observation is also a set of interpretations. The intuition is that the observation \u03b1 provides evidence that the actual world is in the set \u03b1. In order to maintain a superficial distinction, we will use the Greek letter \u03b1 will range over observations and the Greek letter \u03ba to range over belief states, with possible subscripts in each case."}, {"heading": "2.3 Transition Systems", "text": "An action signature is a pair \u3008A,F\u3009 where A,F are non-empty sets of symbols. We call A the set of action symbols, and we call F the set of fluent symbols. Formally, the fluent symbols in F are propositional variables. The action symbols in A denote the actions that an agent may perform. The effects of actions can be specified by a transition system.\nDefinition 1 A transition system T for an action signature \u03c3 = \u3008A,F\u3009 is a pair \u3008S,R\u3009 where\n1. S is a set of propositional interpretations of F,\n2. R \u2286 S \u00d7A\u00d7 S.\nThe set S is called the set of states and R is the transition relation. If (s,A, s\u2032) \u2208 R, then we think of the state s\u2032 as a possible resulting state that could occur if the action A is executed in state s. If there is exactly one possible resulting state s\u2032 when A is executed in s for all s \u2208 S, then we say T is deterministic. We refer to fluent symbols as being true or false if they are assigned the values t or f , respectively. Transition systems can be visualized as directed graphs, where each node is labeled with a state and each edge is labeled with an element of A. In terms of notation, the uppercase letter A, possibly subscripted, will range over actions. We use the notation A\u0304 to denote a finite sequence of action symbols of indeterminate length. Also, given any sequence of actions A\u0304 = \u3008A1, . . . , An\u3009, we write s ;A\u0304 s\n\u2032 to indicate that there is a path from s to s\u2032 that follows the edges labeled by the actions A1, . . . , An.\nIt is useful to introduce the symbol \u03bb to denote the null action that never changes the state of the world. This will be used periodically in formal results. Also, for technical reasons, we assume throughout this paper that every action is executable in every state. If the transition system does not specify the effects of a particular action in a particular state, we assume that the state does not change when that action is executed. This is tantamount to adding self loops for every action at every state where no transition is given.\nExample The litmus paper problem can be represented with the action signature\n\u3008{dip}, {Red ,Blue,Acid}\u3009.\nIntuitively, the fluent symbols Red and Blue represent the colour of the litmus paper, and the fluent symbol Acid indicates whether the beaker contains an acid or not. The only action available is to dip the litmus paper in the beaker\nIn the interest of readability, we will adopt a notational convention in our discussion of the litmus paper problem. In particular, we will let a set V of propositional fluent symbols stand for the interpretation where where the symbols in V are assigned the value true and all other symbols are assigned the value false. Hence, the set {Red} will be used to denote the interpretation I where I(Red) = true, I(Blue) = false and I(Acid) = false. This is a standard representation in the literature on reasoning about action effects. We stress, however, that we are not defining states in this manner; we are simply using this convention in the litmus paper example because it facilitates the specification of an interpretation over a small set of fluent symbols. To be clear, throughout this paper, states are actually defined in terms of interpretations over sets of propositional variables.\nThe effects of dipping in the litmus paper problem are given by the transition system in Figure 1. Note that we have not included all possible states in the figure; we have included only those states that change when an action is executed. We assume that the state remains unchanged when a dipping action is performed in any of the states omitted from the figure."}, {"heading": "2.4 Belief Update", "text": "Belief update is the belief change that occurs when new information is acquired regarding a change in the state of the world. One standard approach to belief update is the Katsuno and Mendelzon approach (1991), which describes belief update in terms of a set of rationality postulates. These postulates are typically referred to as the KM postulates, and they have been analyzed, reformulated, and criticized in several subsequent papers (Boutilier, 1995; Peppas, Nayak, Pagnucco, Foo, Kwok, & Prokopenko, 1996; Lang, 2006). Much of this discussion has focused on the distinction between belief update and belief revision, which we introduce in the next section.\nIn this paper, we adopt an approach to belief update in which beliefs are updated by an action rather than a formula. Intuitively, after executing an action A, an agent updates its belief state by projecting every state s to the state s\u2032 that would result if the action A was executed in the state s.\nDefinition 2 Let T = \u3008S,R\u3009 be a transition system. The update function : 2S \u00d7A \u2192 2S is defined as follows\n\u03ba A = {s\u2032 | (s,A, s\u2032) \u2208 R for some s \u2208 \u03ba}.\nThis operation is actually a form of action progression; it has been argued elsewhere that the standard account of belief update can be understood to be a special case of this kind of progression (Lang, 2006). The advantage of our approach is that it provides a simple representation of the belief change that occurs following an action with conditional effects.\nExample In the litmus paper problem, the agent believes the litmus paper is white, but it is not known whether the beaker contains an acid or a base. Hence, the initial belief state \u03ba consists of two interpretations that can be specified as follows:\n\u03ba = {\u2205, {Acid}}.\nAfter executing the dip action, the new belief state \u03ba dip consists of all possible outcomes of the dip action. Hence, the new belief state contains two interpretations. In the first, Red is true while the rest of the fluents are false. In the second interpretation, Blue and Acid are true, while the rest of the fluents are false. Thus, following a dip action, the agent believes that either the liquid is a base and the litmus paper is red or the liquid is an acid and the litmus paper is blue. To determine which outcome has occurred, the agent must observe the actual color of the paper."}, {"heading": "2.5 Belief Revision", "text": "The term belief revision refers to the process in which an agent incorporates new information with some prior beliefs. In this section, we briefly sketch the most influential approach to belief revision: the AGM approach of Alchourro\u0301n, Ga\u0308rdenfors and Makinson (1985). The AGM approach to belief revision does not provide a specific recipe for revision. Instead, a set of rationality postulates is given and any belief change operator that satisfies the postulates is called an AGM belief revision operator.\nLet F be a propositional signature. A belief set is a deductively closed set of formulas over F. Let + denote the so-called belief expansion operator, which is defined by setting K + \u03c6 to be the deductive closure of K \u222a {\u03c6}. Let \u2217 be a function that maps a belief set and a formula to a new belief set. We say that \u2217 is an AGM belief revision operator if it satisfies the following postulates for every K and \u03c6.\n[AGM1] K \u2217 \u03c6 is deductively closed [AGM2] \u03c6 \u2208 K \u2217 \u03c6 [AGM3] K \u2217 \u03c6 \u2286 K + \u03c6 [AGM4] If \u00ac\u03c6 6\u2208 K, then K + \u03c6 \u2286 K \u2217 \u03c6 [AGM5] K \u2217 \u03c6 = L iff |= \u00ac\u03c6 [AGM6] If |= \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c8, then K \u2217 \u03c6 = K \u2217 \u03c8 [AGM7] K \u2217 (\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2286 (K \u2217 \u03c6) + \u03c8 [AGM8] If \u00ac\u03c8 6\u2208 K \u2217 \u03c6, then (K \u2217 \u03c6) + \u03c8 \u2286 K \u2217 (\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8)\nThe main intuition behind the AGM postulates is that the new information given by \u03c6 must be incorporated, along with \u201cas much of K\u201d as consistently possible. The AGM postulates provide a simple set of conditions that are intuitively plausible as restrictions on belief revision operators. Moreover, the postulates completely determine a specific semantics for revision in terms of pre-orderings over interpretations (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1992). We defer discussion of this semantics to \u00a75, where we describe it in the context of a new belief change operator.\nNote that we have presented the AGM postulates in the traditional setting, where beliefs and observations are given as sets of propositional formulae. In contrast, we represent beliefs and observations as sets of interpretations. However, since we work with a finite language, it is easy to translate between the two approaches and we will provide such translations when required.\nExample In the litmus paper problem, suppose that the paper turns red after dipping. We need to represent this observation in a suitable manner for revision. We stated in \u00a72.2 that an observation is a set of interpretations. Informally, an observation is the set of interepretations that should be considered the most plausible after the observation. In the litmus paper example, the observation that the paper is red is represented by the set of all interpretations where Red is true.\nWe need to revise the current beliefs by an observation that represents the information. Recall that the current belief state is\n\u03ba dip = {{Blue}, {Red ,Acid}}.\nSince we also represent observations by sets of interpretations, the observation that the paper is red is given by the set \u03b1 defined as follows\n\u03b1 = {{Red ,Acid}, {Red}, {Red ,Blue,Acid}, {Red ,Blue}}.\nNote that this observation is consistent with the current belief state, because the intersection is non-empty. Therefore, by [AGM3] and [AGM4], it follows that any AGM revision operator will define the revised belief state to be this intersection. Hence, for any AGM revision operator \u2217, the final belief state is\n{{Red ,Acid}}.\nSo, after dipping the litmus paper and observing the paper is red, we correctly believe that the beaker contains an acid."}, {"heading": "3. Belief Update Preceding Belief Revision", "text": "As stated previously, we are interested in the belief change due to an alternating sequence of actions and observations. The easiest example consists of a single action followed by a single observation. However, throughout this paper, we assume that actions are infallible, and that actions are infallible and the effects of actions are completely specified. Under this\nassumption, a sequence of actions is no more difficult to handle than a single action. As such, the simplest interesting case to consider is given by an expression of the form\n\u03ba A1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 An \u2217 \u03b1. (2)\nIn this case, since there is only a single observation, we can focus entirely on the interaction between revision and update. The general case involving several observations is complicated by the fact that it implicitly requires some form of iterated revision. Our formalism handles the general case, but our initial focus will be on problems of the form in (2). In the next section, we consider an example of such a problem and we illustrate that the most natural solution requires the initial state to be revised at a later point in time.\nWe use the phrase iterated belief change to refer to any scenario where the beliefs of an agent change as a result of multiple sequential events. This is a somewhat non-standard use of the term, as most of the literature on iterated belief change is concerned with the (difficult) problem of iterated belief revision. By constrast, we consider problems of the form 2 to be instances of iterated belief change because a sequence of events is leading to a change in beliefs."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Extended Litmus Paper Problem", "text": "We extend the litmus paper problem. The extended problem is just like the original, except that we allow for the possibility that the paper is not litmus paper; it might simply be a piece of plain white paper. In order to provide a formal representation of this problem, we need to extend the transition system used to represent the original problem by introducing a new fluent symbol Litmus. Informally, Litmus is true just in case the paper is actually litmus paper.\nThe action signature \u3008A,F\u3009 consists of A = {dip} and F = {Red ,Blue,Acid ,Litmus}. We assume the transition system for action effects given in Figure 2, and we assume a given AGM revision operator \u2217.\nWe describe a sequence of events informally. Initially, the agent believes that the paper is a piece of litmus paper, but the agent is unsure about the contents of the beaker. To test the contents, the agent dips the paper in the beaker. After dipping, the agent looks at the paper and observes that it is still white. We are interested in determining a plausible final belief state.\nWe now give a more formal representation of the problem. The initial belief state is\n\u03ba = {{Litmus}, {Litmus,Acid}}.\nAfter dipping the paper in the beaker, we update the belief state as follows:\n\u03ba dip = {{Litmus,Blue}, {Litmus,Red ,Acid}}.\nAt this point, the agent looks at the paper and sees that it is neither blue nor red. This observation is represented by the following set of worlds:\n\u03b1 = {\u2205, {Litmus}, {Acid}, {Litmus,Acid}}.\nThe naive suggestion is to simply revise \u03ba dip by \u03b1. However, this is not guaranteed to give the correct result. It is possible, for example, to define an AGM operator which gives the following final belief state:\n\u03ba\u2032 = {{Litmus}, {Litmus,Acid}}.\nIn this case, the agent believes that the piece of paper is white litmus paper. This is clearly not a plausible final belief state.\nInformally, if the paper is litmus paper, then it must be either red or blue after a dipping action is performed. Hence, neither {Litmus} nor {Litmus,Acid} is a plausible state after dipping; simply revising by the observation may give a belief state that is incorrect because the revision operator does not encode this constraint. The final belief state should consist entirely of states that are possible consequences of dipping. Even if some particular AGM operator does give a plausible final belief state for this example, the process through which the final beliefs is obtained is not sound. In this kind of example, an observation after dipping is actually giving information about the initial belief state. As such, our intuition is that a rational agent should revise the initial belief state in any case.\nWe suggest that a rational agent should reason as follows. After dipping the paper and seeing that it does not change colour, an agent should conclude that the paper was never litmus paper to begin with. The initial belief state should be modified to reflect this new belief before calculating the effects of the dipping action. This approach ensures that we will have a final belief state that is a possible outcome of dipping. At the end of the experiment, the agent should believe that the paper is not litmus paper and the agent should have no definite beliefs regarding the contents of the beaker. Hence, we propose that the most plausible final belief state is the set\n{\u2205, {Acid}}.\nThis simple example serves to illustrate the fact that it is sometimes useful for an agent to revise prior belief states in the face of new knowledge. In order to formalize this intuition in greater generality, we need to introduce some new formal machinery."}, {"heading": "3.2 Interaction Between Revision and Update", "text": "In this section, we give a set of formal properties that we expect to hold when an update is followed by a revision. The properties are not overly restrictive and they do not provide a basis for a categorical semantics; they simply provide a point for discussion and comparison. Our underlying assumption is that action histories are infallible. The most recent observation is always incorporated, provided that it is consistent with the history of actions that have been executed. Hence, the properties we discuss are only expected to hold in action domains in which there are no failed actions and no exogenous actions.\nWe briefly present some of our underlying intuitions. Let \u03ba be a belief state, let A\u0304 be a sequence of actions, and let \u03b1 be an observation. We are interested in the situation where an agent has initial belief state \u03ba, then A\u0304 is executed, and then it is observed that the actual state must be in \u03b1. We adopt the shorthand notation \u03ba A\u0304 as an abbreviation for the sequential update of \u03ba by each element of A\u0304. There are three distinct cases to consider.\n1. There are some \u03b1-states in \u03ba A\u0304.\n2. There are no \u03b1-states in \u03ba A\u0304, but some \u03b1-states in 2F A\u0304.\n3. No \u03b1-states are possible after executing A\u0304.\nCase (1) is the situation in which the observation \u03b1 allows the agent to refine their knowledge of the world. After the observation \u03b1, the agent should believe that the most plausible states are the states in \u03ba A\u0304 that are also in \u03b1. In other words, the agent should adopt the belief state (\u03ba A\u0304) \u2229 \u03b1.\nIn case (2), the agent should conclude that the actual state was not initially in \u03ba. This conclusion is based on our underlying assumption that the action sequence A\u0304 cannot fail, and the additional assumption that a new observation should be incorporated whenever possible. Both of these assumptions can be satisfied by modifying the initial belief state before performing the update. Informally, we would like to modify the initial belief state minimally in a manner that ensures that \u03b1 will be true after executing A\u0304. This is the case that occurs in the extended litmus paper problem.\nCase (3) is problematic, because it suggests that the agent has some incorrect information: either the observation \u03b1 is incorrect or the sequence A\u0304 is incorrect. We are assuming that action histories are infallible. As such, the observation \u03b1 must weakened in some manner in order to remain consistent with A\u0304. In cases where there is no natural weakening, it may be necessary to abandon the observation completely. For a single observation, this is the approach that we take. We view a single observation as a disjunctive constraint on the possible states of world, and we assume that an observation has no meaning with respect to the non-member states. As such, if an agent discovers that the actual state of the world is not included in an observation, then that observation does not offer any information at all. When we consider multiple observations, we taken a more flexible approach which allows an agent to select a minimal repair of the sequence of observations.\nLet \u03ba and \u03b1 be sets of states, let A\u0304 be a sequence of actions, let be an update operator as in Definition 2, and let \u2217 be an AGM revision operator. We formalize our intuitions with the following conditions that should hold when an update is followed by a revision.\nInteraction Properties P1. If (2F A\u0304) \u2229 \u03b1 6= \u2205, then \u03ba A\u0304 \u2217 \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b1 P2. If (2F A\u0304) \u2229 \u03b1 = \u2205, then \u03ba A\u0304 \u2217 \u03b1 = \u03ba A\u0304 P3. (\u03ba A\u0304) \u2229 \u03b1 \u2286 \u03ba A\u0304 \u2217 \u03b1 P4. If (\u03ba A\u0304) \u2229 \u03b1 6= \u2205, then \u03ba A\u0304 \u2217 \u03b1 \u2286 (\u03ba A\u0304) \u2229 \u03b1 P5. \u03ba A\u0304 \u2217 \u03b1 \u2286 2F A\u0304\nWe give some motivation for each property. P1 is a straightforward AGM-type assertion that \u03b1 must hold after revising by \u03b1, provided \u03b1 is possible after executing A\u0304. P2 handles the situation where it is impossible to be in an \u03b1-world after executing A\u0304. In this case, we simply discard the observation \u03b1. Together, P1 and P2 formalize the underlying assumption that there are no failed actions.\nP3 and P4 assert that revising by \u03b1 is equivalent to taking the intersection with \u03b1, provided the intersection is non-empty. These are similar to the AGM postulates asserting that revisions correspond to expansions, provided the observation is consistent with the knowledge base.\nP5 provides the justification for revising prior belief states in the face of new knowledge. It asserts that, after revising by \u03b1, we must still have a belief state that is a possible consequence of executing A\u0304. In some cases, the only way to ensure that \u03b1 holds after executing A\u0304 is to modify the initial belief state. We remark that P5 does not indicate how the initial belief state should be modified.\nIt is worth noting that the interaction properties make no mention of minimal change with respect to the belief state \u03ba. There is a notion of minimal change that is implicit in the revision operator \u2217, but this is a notion change with respect to a measure plausibility that is completely independent of the stated properties."}, {"heading": "3.3 Representing Histories", "text": "Transition systems are only suitable for representingMarkovian action effects; that is, action effects that depend only on the action executed and the current state of the world. However, in the extended litmus paper problem, we saw that the outcome of an observation may depend on prior belief states. Even if action effects are Markovian, it does not follow that changes in belief are Markovian. As such, we need to introduce some formal machinery for representing histories. We will be interested in the historical evolution of an agent\u2019s beliefs, along with all of the actions executed. In order to do so, we need to introduce trajectories of belief states, observations, and actions. For a given action signature \u3008A,F \u3009, we will use the following terminology.\n1. A belief trajectory is an n-tuple \u3008\u03ba0, . . . , \u03ban\u22121\u3009 of belief states.\n2. An observation trajectory is an n-tuple \u03b1\u0304 = \u3008\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n\u3009 where each \u03b1i \u2208 2 S .\n3. An action trajectory is an n-tuple A\u0304 = \u3008A1, . . . , An\u3009 where each Ai \u2208 A.\nNote that, as a matter of convention, we start the indices at 0 for belief trajectories and we start the indices at 1 for observation and action trajectories. The rationale for this convention will be clear later. We also adopt the convention hinted at in the definitions,\nwhereby the ith component of an observation trajectory \u03b1\u0304 will be denoted by \u03b1i, and the ith component of an action trajectory A\u0304 will be denoted by Ai.\nWe remark that a belief trajectory is an agent\u2019s subjective view of how the world has changed. Hence, a belief trajectory represents the agent\u2019s current beliefs about the world history, not a historical account of what an agent believed at each point in time. For example, in the extended litmus paper problem, at the end of the experiment the agent believes that they were never holding a piece of litmus paper. The fact that the agent once believed that they were holding litmus paper is a different issue, one that is not represented in our formal conception of a belief trajectory.\nWe define a notion of consistency between observation trajectories and action trajectories. The intuition is that an observation trajectory \u03b1\u0304 is consistent with an action trajectory A\u0304 if and only if each observation \u03b1i is possible, given that the actions (Aj)j\u2264i have been executed.\nDefinition 3 Let \u03b1\u0304 = \u3008\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n\u3009 be an observation trajectory and let A\u0304 = \u3008A1, . . . , An\u3009 be an action trajectory. We say that A\u0304 is consistent with \u03b1\u0304 if and only if there is a belief trajectory \u3008\u03ba0, . . . , \u03ban\u3009 such that, for all i with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\n1. \u03bai \u2286 \u03b1i\n2. \u03bai = \u03bai\u22121 Ai.\nIf A\u0304 is consistent with \u03b1\u0304, we write A\u0304||\u03b1\u0304. A pair consisting of an action trajectory and an observation trajectory gives a complete picture of an agent\u2019s view of the history of the world. As such, it is useful to introduce the following terminology.\nDefinition 4 A world view of length n is a pairW = \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009, where A\u0304 is an action trajectory and \u03b1\u0304 is an observation trajectory, each of length n. We say W is consistent if A\u0304||\u03b1\u0304."}, {"heading": "4. Belief Evolution", "text": "We are interested in providing a formal treatment of alternating action/observation sequences of the form\n\u03ba A1 \u2217 \u03b11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 An \u2217 \u03b1n.

As such, we would like to propose an alternative method for evaluating expressions of the form (3). However, discussing expressions of this form directly can be somewhat misleading, since we can not preclude the interpretation in (4). In order to make it explicit that we are not computing successive updates and revisions, we introduce a new belief evolution operator \u25e6. Intuitively, \u25e6 simply allows us to associate the information to be incorporated in a manner closer to the following informal expression:\n\u03ba \u25e6 (A1, \u03b11, . . . , An, \u03b1n). (5)\nNote that the update and revision operators have disappeared; we are left with an expression that groups all actions and observations as a single sequence, suggesting that all information should be incorporated simultaneously. However, the order of observations and actions is still significant. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that \u25e6 is defined with respect to given update and revision operators. The new operator is introduced primarily to give us a formal tool to make it explicit that we are not interpreting expressions of the form (3) by the default interpretation in (4).\nThe formal definition of \u25e6 is presented in the following sections, and it does not use the exact syntax in the informal expression (5). In the actual definition, a belief evolution operator takes a belief state and a world view as arguments. Also, the value returned is not a single belief state; it is a belief trajectory. However, (5) provides the important underlying intuition."}, {"heading": "4.1 Infallible Observations", "text": "In this section, we define \u25e6 under the assumption that observations are always correct. Formally, this amounts to a restriction on the world views that are considered. In particular, we need not consider inconsistent world views. It is easy to see that an inconsistent world view is not possible under the assumption that action histories and observations are both infallible.\nLet s\u22121(A) denote the set of all states s\u2032 such that (s\u2032, A, s) \u2208 R. We call s\u22121(A) the pre-image of s with respect to A. The following definition generalizes this idea to give the pre-image of a set of states with respect to a sequence of actions.\nDefinition 5 Let T be a deterministic transition system, let A\u0304 = \u3008A1, . . . , An\u3009 and let \u03b1 be an observation. Define \u03b1\u22121(A\u0304) = {s | s;A\u0304 s \u2032 for some s\u2032 \u2208 \u03b1}.\nHence, if the actual world is an element of \u03b1 following the action sequence A\u0304, then the initial state of the world must be in \u03b1\u22121(A\u0304).\nFor illustrative purposes, it is useful to consider world views of length 1. Suppose we have an initial belief state \u03ba, an action A and an observation \u03b1. Without formally defining the belief evolution operator \u25e6, we can give an intuitive interpretation of an expression of the form\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008\u3008A\u3009, \u3008\u03b1\u3009\u3009 = \u3008\u03ba0, \u03ba1\u3009.\nThe agent knows that the actual world is in \u03b1 at the final point in time, so we must have \u03ba1 \u2286 \u03b1. Moreover, the agent should believe that \u03ba1 is a possible result of executing A from \u03ba0. In other words, we must have \u03ba0 \u2286 \u03b1\n\u22121(A). All other things being equal, the agent would like to keep as much of \u03ba as possible. In order to incorporate \u03b1\u22121(A) while keeping as much of \u03ba as possible, the agent should revise \u03ba by \u03b1\u22121(A). This suggests the following solution.\n1. \u03ba0 = \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 \u22121(A),\n2. \u03ba1 = \u03ba0 A.\nThis reasoning can be applied to world views of length greater than 1. The idea is to trace every observation back to a precondition on the initial belief state. After revising the\ninitial belief state by all preconditions, each subsequent belief state can be determined by a standard update operation.\nWe have the following formal definition for \u25e6. In the definition, for i \u2264 n we let A\u0304i denote the subsequence of actions \u3008A1, . . . , Ai\u3009.\nDefinition 6 Let \u03ba be a belief state, let be an update operator, let \u2217 be an AGM revision operator, let A\u0304 be an action trajectory of length n and let \u03b1\u0304 be an observation trajectory of length n such that A\u0304||\u03b1\u0304. Define\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 = \u3008\u03ba0, . . . , \u03ban\u3009\nwhere\n1. \u03ba0 = \u03ba \u2217 \u22c2 i \u03b1 \u22121 i (A\u0304i)\n2. for i \u2265 1, \u03bai = \u03ba0 A1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Ai.\nWe remark that the intersection of observation preconditions in the definition of \u03ba0 is nonempty, because A\u0304||\u03b1\u0304.\nThe following propositions are immediate, and they demonstrate that for some action sequences of length 1, the operator \u25e6 reduces to either revision or update. In each proposition, we assume that A\u0304||\u03b1\u0304.\nProposition 1 Let \u03ba be a belief state, let A\u0304 = \u3008A\u3009 and let \u03b1\u0304 = \u30082F\u3009. Then\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 = \u3008\u03ba, \u03ba A\u3009.\nProof Recall that we assume every action is executable in every state. It follows that (2F)\u22121(A) = 2F. Therefore\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 = \u3008\u03ba \u2217 2F, (\u03ba \u2217 2F) A\u3009\n= \u3008\u03ba, \u03ba A\u3009.\n2\nIn the next result, recall that \u03bb is a null action that never changes the state of the world.\nProposition 2 Let \u03ba be a belief state, let A\u0304 = \u3008\u03bb\u3009 and let \u03b1\u0304 = \u3008\u03b1\u3009. Then\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 = \u3008\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1, \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1\u3009.\nProof Since \u03bb does not change the state, it follows that \u03b1\u22121(\u03bb) = \u03b1. Therefore\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 = \u3008\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1, (\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1) \u03bb\u3009\n= \u3008\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1, \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1\u3009.\n2\nHence, the original revision and update operators can be retrieved from the \u25e6 operator. As such, it is reasonable to compute the iterated belief change due to action in terms of belief evolution.\nWe will demonstrate that belief evolution provides a reasonable approach for computing the outcome of a sequence of actions and observations. We stress that computing updates and revisions in succession does not provide a reasonable solution in many cases. As such, we want to define the outcome of a sequence of updates and revisions in terms of a belief evolution operator. Given \u2217 and , we define the iterated belief change\n\u03ba A \u2217 \u03b1\nto be the final belief state in the belief trajectory\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008\u3008A\u3009, \u3008\u03b1\u3009\u3009.\nWe adopt this somewhat confusing convention temporarily in order to prove that belief evolution provides a semantics for iterated belief change that satisfies our interaction properties.\nMore generally, consider a sequence A\u0304 of n actions followed by a single observation \u03b1. In this case, define \u03b1\u0304n to be the observation trajectory consisting of n \u2212 1 instances of 2 F followed by the final observation \u03b1. We define the iterated belief change\n\u03ba A\u0304 \u2217 \u03b1\nto be the final belief state in the belief trajectory\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304n\u3009.\nProposition 3 Let A\u0304 be an action trajectory and let \u03b1 be an observation. If A\u0304||\u03b1\u0304n, the iterated belief change \u03ba A\u0304 \u2217 \u03b1 defined as above satisfies the interaction properties P1-P5.\nProof Let \u03ba be a belief state. By the convention outlined above,\n\u03ba A\u0304 \u2217 \u03b1 = (\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1\u22121(A\u0304)) A\u0304.\nWe demonstrate that this definition satisfies P1-P5.\nP1. If (2F A\u0304) \u2229 \u03b1 6= \u2205, then (\u03ba A\u0304) \u2217 \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b1. Note that the antecedent is true because A\u0304 and \u03b1\u0304n are consistent.

The second inclusion holds by definition of the pre-image. Hence, the consequent is true.\nP2. If (2F A\u0304) \u2229 \u03b1 = \u2205, then (\u03ba A\u0304) \u2217 \u03b1 = \u03ba A\u0304 The antecedent is false, since A\u0304 and \u03b1\u0304n are consistent."}, {"heading": "P3.

Moreover, the initial belief state is revised by the pre-image of the final observation, which means it is modified as little as possible while still guaranteeing that the final observation will be feasible.

It simply indicates that the contents of the beaker are still unknown, but the agent now believes the paper is not litmus paper. Hence, a belief evolution operator employs a plausible procedure and returns a desirable result."}, {"heading": "4.2 Fallible Observations", "text": "In this section, we consider belief evolution in the case where observations may be incorrect. Formally, this means that we are interested in determining the outcome of belief evolution\nfor inconsistent world views. In this case, we cannot simply take the intersection of all observation pre-images, because this intersection may be empty. The basic idea behind our approach is to define belief evolution with respect to some external notion of the reliability of an observation.\nWe start by defining belief evolution in the most general case, with respect to a total pre-order over the elements of an observation trajectory \u03b1\u0304. In order to define the pre-order, we assume we are given a function r that maps each element of \u03b1\u0304 to an integer. The actual value of r(\u03b1i) is not particularly important; the function r is just used to impose an ordering on the observations. We interpret\nr(\u03b1i) < r(\u03b1j)\nto mean that \u03b1i is more reliable than \u03b1j . In this case, if consistency can be restored by discarding either \u03b1i or \u03b1j , then \u03b1j is discarded. The ranking function on observations may be obtained in several ways. For example, it may be induced from an ordering over all possible observations, indicating the reliability of sensing information. On the other hand, this pre-order might simply encode a general convention for dealing with sequential observations. For example, in some cases it may be reasonable to prefer a more recent observation over an earlier observation.\nOur basic approach is the following. Given an observation trajectory \u03b1\u0304 that is not consistent with A\u0304, we discard observations in a manner that gives us a consistent world view. To be precise, \u201cdiscarding\u201d an observation in this context means that we replace it with 2F. We discard observations rather than weaken them, because we view the content of an observation as an atomic proposition. We are guided by two basic principles. First, all other things being equal, we would like to keep as much of \u03b1\u0304 as consistently possible. Second, when observations must be discarded, we try to keep those that are the most reliable. With this informal sketch in mind, we define w(\u03b1\u0304), the set of all trajectories obtained by discarding some of the observations in \u03b1\u0304.\nDefinition 7 Let \u03b1\u0304 be an observation trajectory of length n, and let On be the set of all observation trajectories of length n. Then define:\nw(\u03b1\u0304) = {\u03b1\u0304\u2032 | \u03b1\u0304\u2032 \u2208 On and for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, \u03b1 \u2032 i = \u03b1i or \u03b1 \u2032 i = 2 F}.\nWe are interested in finding those trajectories in w(\u03b1\u0304) that are consistent with A\u0304, while differing minimally from \u03b1\u0304.

The minimal trajectories in this ordering are, therefore, those that retain the most plausible observations.\nDefinition 10 The set of repairs of a world view \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 with respect to a reliability function r is given by:\nRep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304) = {\u03b1\u0304\u2032 \u2208 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 \u2193\u22a5 | there is no \u03b1\u0304 \u2032\u2032 \u2208 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 \u2193\u22a5 such that \u03b1\u0304 \u2032\u2032 < \u03b1\u0304\u2032}.\nNote that Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304) may contain several observation trajectories. Moreover, each trajectory in Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304) is consistent with A\u0304, while minimally discarding observations and keeping the most reliable observations possible.\nIn Definition 6, we defined \u25e6 for consistent world views. For inconsistent world views, we use the following definition.\nDefinition 11 Let \u03ba be a belief state, let A\u0304 be an action history, let \u03b1\u0304 be an observation trajectory, and let r be a reliability function. If A\u0304 is not consistent with \u03b1\u0304, then:\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 = {\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u2032\u3009 | \u03b1\u0304\u2032 \u2208 Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304)}.\nThis definition is well-formed, because \u03b1\u0304\u2032 \u2208 Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304) implies A\u0304||\u03b1\u0304\u2032. Note that the outcome of belief evolution in this case is a set of belief trajectories.\nWe adopt the following convention. If \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 = {\u03b1\u0304\u2032}, then we write \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 = \u03b1\u0304\u2032. If |Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304)| = 1, then belief evolution yields a unique belief trajectory. There are natural examples when this is the case.\nProposition 4 Let \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 be a world view of length n. Let r be a reliability function such that \u03b1i 6= \u03b1j implies r(\u03b1i) 6= r(\u03b1j) for all 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n. Then |Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304)| = 1.\nProof Note that \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 \u2193\u22a5 6= \u2205, because it is always possible to find a trajectory consistent with A\u0304 by discarding some of the observations in \u03b1\u0304. It follows immediately that Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304) is non-empty. Hence |Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304)| \u2265 1.\nNow suppose that there exist \u03b1\u0304\u2032 and \u03b1\u0304\u2032\u2032 such that \u03b1\u0304\u2032 \u2208 Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304), \u03b1\u0304\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304) and \u03b1\u0304\u2032 6= \u03b1\u0304\u2032\u2032. Thus\n{\u03b1i | \u03b1 \u2032 i 6= \u03b1 \u2032\u2032 i } 6= \u2205.\nLet \u03b1j \u2208 {\u03b1i | \u03b1 \u2032 i 6= \u03b1 \u2032\u2032 i } be such that r(\u03b1j) is minimal. By assumption, \u03b1j is unique. If \u03b1\u2032j = \u03b1j , then \u03b1\u0304 \u2032 < \u03b1\u0304\u2032\u2032 which contradicts \u03b1\u0304\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304). If \u03b1\u2032j = 2 F, then \u03b1\u0304\u2032\u2032 < \u03b1\u0304\u2032 which\nminimally from \u03b1\u0304 just in case a minimal number of observations is discarded. There are reasonable arguments for both the containment approach and the cardinality approach, depending on the context. Neither approach has a clear theoretical advantage, and the development of each is virtually identical. We determined that this paper is better served by presenting the containment approach in detail, rather than presenting a series of duplicate results for different conceptions of minimality.\ncontradicts \u03b1\u0304\u2032 \u2208 Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304). Therefore, \u03b1\u0304\u2032 = \u03b1\u0304\u2032\u2032. It follows that |Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304)| \u2264 1, because no two elements of Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304) can be distinct. 2 Thus if r assigns a unique value to each observation, then belief evolution yields a unique outcome. We return to this fact in the next section.\nIn cases where belief evolution does not yield a unique result, a skeptical approach can be defined by taking a union on initial belief states. Recall that \u03ba0 is the first element in the trajectory \u03ba. If we define\n\u03ba0 = \u22c3 {\u03ba\u20320 | \u03ba \u2032 \u2208 \u03ba \u25e6Rep(A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304)}.\nthen a unique belief trajectory can then be defined by computing the effects of actions. This trajectory is general enough to include the outcome of every minimal repair. This kind of skeptical approach is appropriate in some situations."}, {"heading": "4.3 Recency", "text": "One well-known approach to dealing with sequences of observations is to give precedence to recent information (Nayak, 1994; Papini, 2001). Given an observation trajectory \u03b1\u0304, a preference for recent information can be represented in our framework by defining r such that r(\u03b1i) = \u2212i. For our purposes, recency provides a concrete reliability ordering over observations, which facilitates the presentation of examples and comparison with related formalisms. As such, throughout the remainder of this paper, we use \u25e6 to denote the belief evolution operator \u25e6 defined with respect to this function r.\nWe stress that this preference for recent information is just a convention that we adopt because it simplifies the exposition, and we note that this convention has been the subject of criticism (Delgrande, Dubois, & Lang, 2006). Note that, by Proposition 4, belief evolution under the recency convention defines a unique belief trajectory as an outcome. As such, belief evolution under the recency convention also defines a specific approach to iterated revision. A sequence of several observations interspersed with null actions is no longer computed by simply applying a single shot revision operator several times. We will explore the approach to iterated revision that is implicit in our belief evolution operators in \u00a76.2.\nWe conclude this section with a useful result. Thus far, applying the \u25e6 operator requires tracing action preconditions back to the initial state for revision, then applying action effects to get a complete history. If we are only concerned with the final belief state, then there are many cases in which we do not need to go to so much effort. In the following proposition, it is helpful to think of 2F as a \u201cnull observation\u201d that provides no new information.\nProposition 5 Let \u03ba be a belief state, let A\u0304 be an action trajectory of length n and let \u03b1 be a belief state such that \u03b1 \u2286 \u03ba A\u0304. If \u03b1\u0304 is the observation trajectory with n\u2212 1 observations of 2F followed by a single observation \u03b1, then the final belief state in \u03ba\u25e6\u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 is (\u03ba A\u0304)\u2217\u03b1.\nProof By definition, the final belief state of \u03ba \u25e6 \u3008A\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 is\n(\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1\u22121(A\u0304)) A\u0304.\nSince \u03b1 \u2286 \u03ba A\u0304, the intersection \u03ba \u2229 \u03b1\u22121(A\u0304) is non-empty. By [AGM3] and [AGM4], it follows that\n\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1\u22121(A\u0304) = \u03ba \u2229 \u03b1\u22121(A\u0304)\nand therefore (\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1\u22121(A\u0304)) A\u0304 = (\u03ba \u2229 \u03b1\u22121(A\u0304)) A\u0304.\nClearly, the right hand side of this equality is equal to (\u03ba A\u0304) \u2229 \u03b1. Again, since \u03b1 \u2286 \u03ba A\u0304, it follows from [AGM3] and [AGM4] that this is (\u03ba A\u0304) \u2217 \u03b1. 2\nThe proposition indicates that, given a single observation that is consistent with the actions that have been executed, we can simply revise the outcome of the actions and we get the correct final belief state."}, {"heading": "5. Defining Belief Evolution Through Orderings on Interpretations", "text": "In the next two sections, we provide a characterization of belief evolution operators terms of total pre-orders on interpretations. We restrict attention to the case involving one action followed by one observation. This result extends easily to the case involving n actions followed by one observation, because action sequences of length n simply define a new set of transitions over states. Since we prove our characterization for an arbitrary action signature, allowing n actions prior to a single observation is no more difficult than allowing only one action. We present the case with a single action, as it simplifies the exposition by allowing us to avoid introducing sequences of null observations interspersed with the actions. We remark that our result does not extend directly to the case involving several observations, as we do not introduce an axiomatic account of the reliability of an observation.\nFirst, we need to delineate a general class of belief change functions.\nDefinition 12 A combined belief change operator is a function\n\u25e6\u0307 : 2S \u00d7 \u3008A, 2S\u3009 \u2192 2S .\nHence, a combined belief change operator takes a belief state and an ordered pair \u3008A,\u03b1\u3009 as input, and it returns a new belief state.\nFor a fixed update operator and a fixed revision operator \u2217, consider the following postulates.\nI1 If (2F A) \u2229 \u03b1 6= \u2205, then \u03ba\u25e6\u0307\u3008A,\u03b1\u3009 = \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1\u22121(A) A.\nI2 If (2F A) \u2229 \u03b1 = \u2205, then \u03ba\u25e6\u0307\u3008A,\u03b1\u3009 = \u03ba A.\nIf we abuse our notation by letting \u03ba\u25e6\u3008A,\u03b1\u3009 denote the final belief state in the corresponding belief trajectory, then we get the following result.

Our characterization will be defined in terms of total pre-orderings over interpretations. First we need to introduce the basic characterization of AGM revision operators in terms of total pre-orders, due to Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992). Our presentation differs slightly from the original because we define revision operators on sets of states rather than formulas.\nDefinition 13 (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1992) Given a belief state \u03ba, a total pre-order \u2264\u03ba over interpretations is called a faithful ranking with respect to \u03ba just in case the following conditions hold:\n\u2022 If s1, s2 \u2208 \u03ba, then s1 =\u03ba s2.\n\u2022 If s1 \u2208 \u03ba and s2 6\u2208 \u03ba, then s1 <\u03ba s2.\nHence, a faithful ranking is simply a total pre-order where the minimal elements are the members of \u03ba. In order to simplify the discussion, we introduce the following notation. If \u03b1 is a set of states and \u2264 is an ordering on a superset of \u03b1:\nmin(\u03b1,\u2264) = {s | s \u2208 \u03b1 and s is \u2264 -minimal among interpretations in \u03b1)}.\nThe following definition characterizes AGM revision operators in terms of pre-orders on interpretations.\nProposition 7 (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1992) Given a belief state \u03ba, a revision operator \u2217 satisfies the AGM postulates if and only if there exists a faithful ranking \u2264\u03ba with respect to \u03ba such that for any set of interpretations \u03b1:\n\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 = min(\u03b1,\u2264\u03ba).\nIn the remainder of this section, we extend this result to characterize belief evolution operators.\nAssume we are given a fixed transition system T = \u3008S,R\u3009 defining an update operator . The following definition gives a natural progression operation on pre-orderings.\nDefinition 14 If \u2264\u03ba is a faithful ranking with respect to \u03ba and A is an action, then define \u2264\u03ba A such that s1 \u2264\u03ba A s2 if and only if\n\u2022 There exist t1, t2 such that (t1, A, s1) \u2208 R and (t2, A, s2) \u2208 R).\n\u2022 t1 \u2264\u03ba t2.\nNote that \u2264\u03ba A is not generally a total pre-order because it may be the case that some states are not possible outcomes of the action A. Hence \u2264\u03ba A is a partial pre-order. We can think of \u2264\u03ba A as a \u201cshifted\u201d ordering, with minimal elements \u03ba A.\nThe following definition associates a combined revision operator with a faithful ranking.\nDefinition 15 Let \u2264\u03ba be a faithful ranking with respect to \u03ba.

We will prove that the class of functions definable in this manner coincides exactly with the class of belief evolution operators.\nWe first prove that every faithful ranking defines a belief evolution operator.\nProposition 8 Let \u2264\u03ba be a faithful ranking with respect to \u03ba and let \u25e6\u0307 be the combined belief change operator defined by \u2264\u03ba.

Given a belief state \u03ba, there is a faithful ranking \u2264\u03ba such that \u25e6\u0307 is the combined belief change operator defined by \u2264\u03ba.\nProof By Proposition 7, there is a a faithful ranking \u2264\u03ba with respect to \u03ba such that\n\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 = min(\u03b1,\u2264\u03ba)\nfor all \u03b1. Fix a particular \u03b1 and let A be an action symbol. Suppose that (2F A)\u2229\u03b1 6= \u2205. So, by I1:\n\u03ba\u25e6\u0307\u3008A,\u03b1\u3009 = \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1\u22121(A) A.\nBy definition of \u2217, this is equal to\nmin(\u03b1\u22121(A),\u2264\u03ba) A\nThis is equivalent to: min(\u03b1\u22121(A) A,\u2264\u03ba A)\nSimplifying the first argument, we get:\nmin(\u03b1,\u2264\u03ba A)\nwhich is what we wanted to show. Now suppose that \u03b1 (2F A) \u2229 \u03b1 = \u2205 then,\n\u03ba\u25e6\u0307\u3008A,\u03b1\u3009 = \u03ba A (by I2)\nThis completes the proof. 2\nHence, the class of belief evolution operators can be characterized by simply shifting the total pre-order that defines the revision operator. This characterization is essentially a corollary of Katsuno and Mendelzon\u2019s representation result for AGM revision. However, this approach does represent a significant departure from the iterative approach to applying update and revision operators. What our result demonstrates is that the progression of beliefs through actions should be applied at the level of the same pre-order that is used for revision. In this manner, the relative likelihood of all states is shifted appropriately when an action is executed. This ensures that later revisions use the same ordering that would be used initially, which captures our intuition that the execution of actions does not change any a priori likelihood of initial states of the world."}, {"heading": "6. Comparison with Related Work", "text": "Many action formalisms define action effects to be Markovian. This is the case, for example, in action languages like A (Gelfond & Lifschitz, 1998). When action formalisms of this kind are supplemented with sensing actions, there is a natural tendency to compute epistemic change by computing the effects of ontic actions and sensing actions in succession. This is the implicit approach to iterated belief change caused by actions in the epistemic extensions of A (Lobo et al., 2001; Son & Baral, 2001). We have seen that this strategy is not appropriate\nfor litmus-type problems. However, this does not mean that such formalisms can not be used for reasoning about iterated belief change due to action. It simply means that some care must be taken to define the iterated change correctly.\nBelief evolution should not be seen as a formalism in competition with Markovian formalisms; it should be seen as a methodology for extending Markovian formalisms to address iterated belief change. If the revision and update operators are given explicitly, the definition of the corresponding belief evolution operator is straightforward. This is true even in formalisms where the basic operators are relatively sophisticated, such as those defined in the multi-agent belief structures of Herzig, Lang and Marquis (2004)."}, {"heading": "6.1 The Situation Calculus", "text": "In this section, we compare our work with an extended version of the SitCalc that explicitly represents the beliefs of agents.

Every situation term can be written as follows:\ndo(An, do(An\u22121, . . . , do(A1, S0) . . . ).\nTo simplify the notation, we will abbreviate this situation as do([A1, . . . , An], S0).\nTo clarify the results that follow, we adopt the following convention. Expressions such as s and do(A, s) will be used as syntactic variables ranging over situation terms. We will also need to refer explicitly to the semantic objects denoted by terms in a given first-order interpretation M of a situation calculus theory. Hence, we let sM denote the situation denoted by the situation term s in the first-order interpretation M. We adopt the same convention to denote the extensions of predicate symbols in an interpretation.\nThe SitCalc has been extended to include a representation of belief (Shapiro et al., 2000). The extension includes a distinguished fluent symbol B that represents an accessibility relation on situations, similar to those used in modal logics of belief. The extension also includes a distinguished function symbol pl that assigns a numeric value to each situation. The function pl is a plausibility function, and the intended interpretation of pl(s1) < pl(s2) is that s1 is more plausible than s2. The formula Bel(\u03c6, s) which expresses the fact that \u03c6 is believed in situation s, is defined as follows:\nBel(\u03c6, s) \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200s\u2032[B(s\u2032, s) \u2227 (\u2200s\u2032\u2032B(s\u2032\u2032, s) \u2192 pl(s\u2032) \u2264 pl(s\u2032\u2032))] \u2192 \u03c6[s\u2032].\nThis formula states that \u03c6 is believed in s if and only if \u03c6 is true in every B-accessible situation that is assigned a minimal pl-value. In other words, \u03c6 is believed if it is true in all of the most plausible worlds that are considered possible.\nNote that the accessibility relation B can be used to define a formula init(s) that defines a set of initial situations:\ninit(s) \u21d4 B(s, S0).\nThe set of situations initially believed possible are the pl-minimal elements of init. Since init is a formula with one free variable, it defines a set of situations in a given first-order theory. We will let initM denote the set of situations that satisfy init in the interpretation M. The successor state axiom for pl is straightforward, and it guarantees the following condition:\npl(do(a, s)) = pl(s).\nIn order to express the successor state axiom for B, it is convenient to distinguish between ontic actions that change the state of the world, and sensing actions that simply give an agent information about the world. For ontic actions, the successor state axiom for B guarantees the following:\nB(s\u2032, do(A, s)) \u21d0\u21d2 \u2203s\u2032\u2032(B(s\u2032\u2032, s)) \u2227 s\u2032 = do(A, s\u2032\u2032).\nThis axiom states that s is accessible after executing A if and only if s is accessible from some world that results from executing A in a state that is considered possible. The effects of binary sensing actions are given through a special sensing predicate SF (Levesque, 1996). For our purposes, it will be sufficient to restrict attention to sensing actions that simply determine the truth value of a single fluent symbol. For sensing actions, the successor state axiom for B says that s\u2032 is B-related to do(O, s) just in case s\u2032 agrees with s on the value of the sensed fluent symbol. The effects of sensing actions in the SitCalc define an approach to belief revision that satisfies five of the AGM postulates (Shapiro et al., 2000).\nIn order to compare belief change in the SitCalc with belief evolution, we need to express situations in terms of states. In order to simplify the discussion, we will restrict attention to SitCalc action theories where every fluent symbol is unary, with the exception of the distinguished accessibility fluent B. We say that a SitCalc theory T is elementary if it satisfies the following conditions:\n1. The set of fluent symbols is F \u222a {B}, where each F \u2208 F is unary.\n2. T is complete.\n3. Every interpretation with M |= T has the following properties:\n(a) M |= init(S0).\n(b) |{x | initM(x)}| = 2|F|.\n(c) If M |= init(s1) \u2227 init(s2) \u2227 s1 6= s2, then there is some fluent symbol F \u2208 F such that M |= F (si) for exactly one of s1 and s2.\nElementary SitCalc theories are essentially categorical on the set of initial situations. Given a model M of an elementary SitCalc theory, each situation sM defines a propositional\ninterpretation IMs over the set F of unary fluent symbols. Specifically, for each situation sM, we define IMs as follows:\nIMs |= F \u21d0\u21d2 F M(sM).\nWe can also use this idea to associate a belief state with every situation sM. For ease of readability, in the following definition we omit the superscript M on all situation terms and fluent symbols on the right hand side:\n\u03ba(s,M) = \u22c3 {Is\u2032 | B(s \u2032, s) and (\u2200s\u2032\u2032B(s\u2032\u2032, s) \u2192 pl(s\u2032) \u2264 pl(s\u2032\u2032))}.\nHence \u03ba(s,M) is the set of states with minimal plausibility among the situations that are are BM-accessible from sM. For a modelM of an elementary SitCalc theory T , we define belief update, belief revision and belief evolution. For any ontic action symbol A, define M as follows.\n\u03ba(s,M) M A = \u03ba(do(A,s),M).\nNote that the plausibility function plM defines a total pre-order over the initial situations. Since the initial situations are in 1-1 correspondence with interpretations of F, it follows that plM defines a total pre-order over interpretations of F. Let \u2217M denote the AGM revision operator corresponding to this ordering. Finally, let \u25e6M denote the belief evolution operator obtained from M and \u2217M. For ease of readability, we will omit the subscript when the theory M is clear.\nIn order to state our main result concisely, we introduce some simplifying notation. Let O be a sensing action symbol for the fluent symbol FO, and let M be a suitable first-order interpretation. We define a set of propositional interpretations over F as follows:\nOMs =\n{\n{I | I |= F0}, if F M O (s M) {I | I |= \u00acF0}, otherwise\nInuitively OMs is the set of interpretations that agree with I M s on the value of the fluent FO. In the following result, let \u03ba(s,M) \u25e6 \u3008A,\u03b1\u3009 stand for the final belief state given by this belief evolution operation.\nProposition 10 Let T be an elementary SitCalc theory, let M |= T and let \u25e6 be the evolution operator induced by M. If O is a sensing action and A is an ontic action, then:\n\u03ba(do([A,O],S0),M) = \u03ba(S0,M) \u25e6 \u3008A,O M S0 )\u3009.\nProof Without loss of generality, assume that M |= FO(do(A,S0)). In other words, assume that FO holds in the situation resulting from executing the action A. Under this assumption, we must prove\n\u03ba(do([A,O],S0),M) = \u03ba(S0,M) \u2217 |FO| \u22121(A) A.\nIf FO happens to be false after executing A, the changes required in the proof are obvious. Note that M |= B(s, do([A,O], S0)) just in case:\n1. s = do(A, s1) for some s1 with B M(sM1 , S M 0 ), and\n2. FMO (s).\nSuppose that I \u2208 \u03ba(do([A,O],S0),M). It follows that I = I M s for some situation term s that satisfies conditions (1) and (2), and also has the property that sM is plM-minimal among situations that are BM accessible from do([A,O], S0)\nM . Consider the situation term s1 in condition (1). Clearly IMs1 \u2208 |FO| \u22121(A), because M |= FO(do(A, s \u2032)). Now suppose there exists s2 with the following properties:\n1. IMs2 \u2208 |FO| \u22121(A)\n2. M |= B(do([A,O], s2), do([A,O]), S0))\n3. plM(sM2 ) < pl M(sM1 ).\nBy the successor state axiom for pl, it follows that\nplM(do(A, s2) M) < plM(do(A, s1) M) = plM(sM).\nThis contradicts the plM-minimality of sM among situations that are BM accessible from do([A,O], S0) M. Therefore, there is no such s2. So s M 1 is pl\nM-minimal among situations that satisfy the first two properties above defining s2.\nRecall that M is elementary, so every propositional interpretation I \u2208 |FO| \u22121(A) is equal to IMt for some initial situation t. Note that, if I \u2208 |FO| \u22121(A), then I = IMt for some t that satisfies points (1) and (2) in the specification of s2 above. If I \u2208 |FO| \u22121(A) is less than IMs1 in the total pre-order on interpretations defined by pl M, then this situation t also satisfies the third condition. We have seen that this is not possible. So, if \u2264Mpl is the total pre-order on interpretations defined by plM, then we have:\nIMs1 \u2208 min(|FO| \u22121(A),\u2264Mpl )\n= \u03ba(S0,M) \u2217 |FO| \u22121(A) (by definition)\nBut then, since sM = do(A, s1) M:\nIMs \u2208 \u03ba(S0,M) \u2217 |FO| \u22121(A) A.\nSo \u03ba(do([A,O],S0),M) \u2286 \u03ba(S0,M) \u2217 |FO| \u22121(A) A.\nFor the other direction, suppose that I \u2208 \u03ba(S0,M) \u2217 |FO| \u22121(A) A. So there is some\nI \u2032 \u2208 \u03ba(S0,M) \u2217 |FO| \u22121(A) such that I \u2032 A = I. But then I \u2032 = IMs for some pl M-minimal situation sM \u2208 initM such that M |= FO(do(A, s)). Since s M \u2208 initM, it follows that\nM |= B(do(A, s), do(A,S0)).\nMoreover, since M |= FO(do(A, s)), it follows that\nM |= B(do([A,O], s), do([A,O], S0)).\nNow suppose that there is a situation term s1 such that M |= B(s1, do([A,O], S0)) and plM(sM1 ) < pl M(do(A, s))M. It follows immediately that there is some sM2 \u2208 init M\nsuch that do([A,O], s2) M = sM1 . Moreover, by the successor state axiom for pl, we have plM(sM2 ) < pl M(sM). However, since sM2 \u2208 init\nM, this contradicts the plM minimality of sM among initial situations. So there is no such sM1 . Therefore Ido(A,s) \u2208 \u03bado([A,O],S0). Recall that IM do(A,s) = I M s A = I. Therefore, I \u2208 \u03ba(do([A,O],S0),M). 2\nSkimming over the details, the preceding proof simply relies on the condition that M |= pl(do(a, s)) = pl(s) in every epistemic SitCalc model. The fact that plausibility values persist following the execution of actions is equivalent to restricting belief change by always revising the initial belief state, then determining the final belief state by simply computing ontic action effects. Hence, the semantics of revision actions in the SitCalc can be framed as an instance of belief evolution. We suggest that this is an important point in discussing belief change in the SitCalc. In the original description of the approach, the belief change due to a sensing action is identified with belief revision (Shapiro et al., 2000). On this view, the fact that sensing actions do not satisfy all of the AGM postulates can be seen as a problem with the approach. However, when we are explicit about the fact that belief change in the SitCalc is a form of belief evolution, this is no longer a problem. We do not expect the AGM postulates to be satisfied, as we need to be concerned with the interaction between ontic actions and sensing actions.\nWe conclude this section by remarking that belief evolution operators do have one expressive advantage over the epistemic extension of the SitCalc. In the epistemic extension that we have considered, the information obtained from sensing actions is always correct. As a result, it is not sensible to consider revising by F followed by \u00acF . By contrast, in belief evolution, this is simply handled by keeping the more reliable observation. Hence, belief evolution is able to deal with unreliable perception in a straightforward manner that is not possible in the SitCalc. We remark however, that inconsistent observations have been treated in a later extension of the SitCalc postulating exogenous actions to account for the inconsistent sensing information (Shapiro & Pagnucco, 2004)."}, {"heading": "6.2 Iterated Belief Revision", "text": "Recall that \u03bb is a null action that does not change the state of the world. If we consider action domains where agents can perform \u03bb, then sequential belief revision is a special case of belief evolution.\nObservation 1 For any \u03ba and \u03b1\u0304, there is a unique belief state \u03ba\u2032 such that\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008\u03bb\u0304, \u03b1\u0304\u3009 = \u3008\u03ba\u2032, . . . , \u03ba\u2032\u3009.\nSince every action is null, the unique belief state \u03ba\u2032 is the belief state that results after the sequence \u03b1 of observations. In this section, we consider belief evolution operators from the perspective of the well-known Darwiche-Pearl postulates for iterated revision (Darwiche & Pearl, 1997).\nFirst, it is important to note that belief evolution does not define iterated revision as a simple sequence of AGM revision operations. According to Definition 11, inconsistencies between observations are resolved by keeping the more reliable observations. By default, we take recency as our measure of reliability. To illustrate, consider a simple example. In\nthe following expression, let \u03b1\u0303 denote the complement of \u03b1\n\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008\u3008\u03bb, \u03bb\u3009, \u3008\u03b1\u0303, \u03b1\u3009\u3009.\nIn this example, the observation \u03b1\u0303 is followed by the observation \u03b1. The final belief state is not obtained by performing two single-shot revisions, however. According to Definition 11 with the recency ordering, the first observation is discarded because it is inconsistent with a more recent observation. As such, the final belief state after this operation is \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1. Hence, the approach to iterated revision that is implicit in belief evolution is not a naive iteration. It is therefore reasonable to ask if the implicit iterated revision operator satisfies existing rationality postulates.\nWe state the Darwiche-Pearl postulates in terms of possible worlds. Let \u03ba, \u03b1, and \u03b2 be sets of possible worlds. The Darwiche-Pearl postulates are as follows.\nDarwiche-Pearl Postulates [DP1] If \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b2, then (\u03ba \u2217 \u03b2) \u2217 \u03b1 = \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1.\n[DP2] If \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b2\u0303, then (\u03ba \u2217 \u03b2) \u2217 \u03b1 = \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1. [DP3] If \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b2, then (\u03ba \u2217 \u03b2) \u2217 \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b2.\n[DP4] If \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 6\u2286 \u03b2\u0303, then (\u03ba \u2217 \u03b2) \u2217 \u03b1 6\u2286 \u03b2\u0303.\nWe would like to determine if these postulates hold when we perform belief evolution with null actions.\nWe define the iterated revision operator obtained from \u25e6 as follows:\n\u03ba \u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b1 =def \u03ba \u25e6 \u3008\u03bb\u0304, \u3008\u03b2, \u03b1\u3009\u3009. (6)\nOf course this is not true if we apply the AGM operator on the left successively. But we adopt this convention as a definition of iterated revision under \u25e6 because it allows us to ask if the Darwiche-Pearl postulates hold. It is critical to remark, however, that we are using a notational convention that defines iterated revision in terms of belief evolution.\nGiven that we have to introduce a new notational convention to even ask if the DarwichePearl postulates hold, one might question why we are concerned with these postulates. In other words, why is it important to check that belief evolution operators satisfy key properties of iterated belief revision? Our stance is that these postulates matter for belief evolution because we can en up using belief evolution operators for iterated revision \u201cby accident.\u201d Although our focus is on iterated sequences of actions and observations, there will be cases where the actions are all null and we are clearly looking at a case of iterated revision. It would be problematic if belief evolution handled such cases poorly, so we would like to ensure that these instances of iterated revision are handled appropriately. One way to assess \u201cappropriateness\u201d is by checking if the Darwiche-Pearl postulates hold.\nThe next result relies on the following crucial observation. If \u03b1 6= \u2205, then\n\u03ba \u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b1 =\n{\n\u03ba \u2217 (\u03b2 \u2229 \u03b1) if \u03b2 \u2229 \u03b1 6= \u2205 \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 otherwise\nThis observation follows immediately from the definition of belief evolution. By using this expression, we can prove the following result.\nProposition 11 Let \u25e6 be a belief evolution operator and let \u03b1 6= \u2205. Then the iterated revision operator as given in (6) satisfies the Darwiche-Pearl postulates.\nProof Note that \u03b1\u22121(\u03bb) = \u03b1 and \u03b2\u22121(\u03bb) = \u03b2. Since \u03b1 6= \u2205, we need to show that the DP postulates are satisfied by \u03ba \u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b1, as defined in the observation above.\nFor [DP1], suppose that \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b2. Since \u03b1 6= \u2205, it follows that \u03b2 \u2229 \u03b1 6= \u2205 and hence \u03ba \u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b1 = \u03ba \u2217 (\u03b2 \u2229 \u03b1). But \u03b2 \u2229 \u03b1 = \u03b1, so the right hand side is equal to \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1.\nFor [DP2], suppose that \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b2\u0303. Hence, \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2 = \u2205 and the desired conclusion follows immediately.\nFor [DP3], suppose that \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b2. Since \u03b1 6= \u2205, it follows from [AGM5] that \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 6= \u2205. So there exists some s \u2208 \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1. But then s \u2208 \u03b1 since \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b1, and s \u2208 \u03b2 since \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b2. Hence \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2 6= \u2205, and therefore\n\u03ba \u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b1 = \u03ba \u2217 (\u03b2 \u2229 \u03b1) \u2286 \u03b2 \u2229 \u03b1 \u2286 \u03b2.\nFor [DP4], suppose that \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 6\u2286 \u03b2\u0303. So there exists some s \u2208 \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 such that s \u2208 \u03b2. It follows that s \u2208 \u03b1\u2229 \u03b2, so \u03b1\u2229 \u03b2 6= \u2205. Translating to possible worlds, postulate [AGM7] says the following:\nif \u03ba \u2217 \u03b1 6\u2286 \u03b2\u0303, then (\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1) \u2229 \u03b2 \u2286 \u03ba \u2217 (\u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2).\nSince s \u2208 (\u03ba \u2217 \u03b1) \u2229 \u03b2, this implies that s \u2208 \u03ba \u2217 (\u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2). But then, since \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2 6= \u2205 it follows by definition that s \u2208 \u03ba \u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b1. Hence s \u2208 \u03b2 and s \u2208 \u03ba \u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b1. Therefore s \u2208 \u03ba \u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b1 6\u2286 \u03b2\u0303. 2 It is well known that many AGM revision operators do not satisfy the Darwiche-Pearl postulates when applied in succession. Proposition 11 shows that, even if we start with a single-shot revision operator, the approach to iterated revision induced by belief evolution is always a Darwiche-Pearl operator.\nIt is easy to demonstrate that belief evolution also satisfies the so-called recalcitrance postulate introduced by Nayak, Pagnucco and Peppas (2003). Rephrased in terms of possible worlds and belief evolution, recalcitrance is the following property:\n(Recalcitrance) If \u03b2 \u2229 \u03b1 6= \u2205, then (\u03ba \u25e6 \u3008\u03bb\u0304, \u3008\u03b2, \u03b1\u3009) \u2286 \u03b2.\nIt is known that DP1, DP2, and (Recalcitrance) characterize Nayak\u2019s lexicographic iterated revision operator on epistemic states (Booth & Meyer, 2006). It follows from this that our approach to iterated revision also satisfies the independence postulate introduced independently by Jin and Thielscher (2007) as well as Booth and Meyer (2006). This gives a complete characterization of the iterated revision operator that is implicit in belief evolution, from the perspective of the Darwiche-Pearl tradition."}, {"heading": "6.3 Lehmann Postulates", "text": "In this section, we consider belief evolution from the perspective of Lehmann\u2019s postulates (1995). Given observation trajectories O and O\u2032, let O \u00b7O\u2032 denote the concatenation of the two sequences. If \u03b1 is an observation, we write O \u00b7\u03b1 as a shorthand for O \u00b7 \u3008\u03b1\u3009. Finally, for the remainder of this section we write \u03ba \u25e6 O as an abbreviation for the final belief state in \u03ba \u25e6 \u3008\u03bb\u0304, O\u3009. Translated into our notation, the Lehmann postulates are as follows.\nLehmann Postulates [L2] \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1) \u2286 \u03b1. [L3] If \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1) \u2286 \u03b2 and \u03ba \u25e6O \u2286 \u03b1, then \u03ba \u25e6O \u2286 \u03b2. [L4] If \u03ba \u25e6O \u2286 \u03b1, then \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7O\u2032) = \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7O\u2032). [L5] If \u03b2 \u2286 \u03b1, then \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03b2 \u00b7O\u2032) = \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b2 \u00b7O\u2032).

However, we omit Lehmann\u2019s first postulate as it states that sequences of observed formulas define a consistent theory. Since we work directly with sets of states rather than formulas, this kind of postulate is not necessary.\nFrom the perspective of iterated belief change, a more interesting distinction between our approach and Lehmann\u2019s approach can be seen by looking at postulates [L4]-[L6]. Lehmann views [L4]-[L6] as dealing with \u201csuperfluous revisions\u201d (Lehmann, 1995). For example, in postulate [L4], the observation \u03b1 is superfluous because revising by the observations in O already leads an agent to believe that the actual state is in \u03b1. As such, observing \u03b1 after O does not provide any new information. The postulate [L4] suggests that such observations may be discarded. This kind of reasoning is not supported in belief evolution, because the observation \u03b1 may take on new meaning following future observations. Postulates [L5] and [L6] are problematic for similar reasons.\nWe present a counterexample that illustrates that postulates [L4]-[L6] all fail for belief evolution.\nExample Let s1, s2, s3 be states over some action signature. Define \u03ba, \u03b1, O and O \u2032 as follows:\n\u03ba = {s1}\n\u03b1 = {s2, s3}\n\u03b2 = {s3}\nO = \u3008{s3}\u3009\nO\u2032 = \u3008{s1, s2}\u3009\nWe demonstrate that [L4]-[L6] all fail for this example. Let \u25e6 be a belief evolution operator obtained from some update operator and some AGM revision operator \u2217. Note that\n\u03ba \u25e6O = {s1} \u2217 {s3} = {s3} \u2286 \u03b1.\nHowever,\n\u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7O\u2032) = {s1} \u2217 {s1, s2} = {s1}\n\u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7O\u2032) = {s1} \u2217 {s2} = {s2}.\nHence \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7O\u2032) 6= \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7O\u2032), which violates [L4]. Since \u03b2 = \u03ba \u25e6O, this also violates [L5].\nLet \u03b3 = {s1, s3}. The following equalities refute [L6].\n\u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1) = {s3} 6\u2286 \u03b3\u0303\n\u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03b3 \u00b7O\u2032) = {s1}\n\u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b3 \u00b7O\u2032) = {s2}.\nThe preceding example demonstrates that [L4]-[L6] do not hold for belief evolution; however, it is perhaps too abstract to illustrate the intuitive problem. At the level of commonsense reasoning, it is instructive to imagine a situation involving a certain bird that is either red, yellow or black. Postulate [L4] says that the following informal sequences lead to the same belief state:\nBelieve(bird is red) + Observe(black, red OR yellow) Believe(bird is red) + Observe(black, yellow OR black, red OR yellow)\nHowever, we can see that such sequences are not the same from the perspective of our belief evolution operators. In both sequences, the first observation is discarded2. In the first case, the agent is left to keep the initial belief that the bird is red because that is consistent with the final observation. By contrast, in the second case, the final two observations are combined to suggest that the bird is yellow. Following the intuitions of AGM revision, the agent then believes the bird is yellow. Similar \u201cbird colour\u201d arguments can be used to demonstrate whey [L5] and [L6] fail for belief evolution.\nAlthough [L4]-[L6] do not hold, we can construct weaker versions that do hold. We have claimed that the reason these postulates fail is because future observations may affect the interpretation of observations that are initially superfluous. To avoid this problem, we modify the postulates by removing the observations that follow a superfluous observation. Weakening gives the following postulates:\nWeak Lehmann Postulates [L4\u2217] If \u03ba \u25e6O \u2286 \u03b1 and O 6= \u2205\u0304, then \u03ba \u25e6O = \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1). [L5\u2217] If \u03b2 \u2286 \u03b1, then \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03b2) = \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b2). [L6\u2217] If \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1) 6\u2286 \u03b2\u0303, then \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03b2) = \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2).\nIf [L4]-[L6] are replaced with [L4\u2217]-[L6\u2217], then belief evolution satisfies the resulting set of postulates.\nProposition 12 Let \u25e6 be a belief evolution operator, let \u03b1 6= \u2205 and let O be an observation trajectory where each component is non-empty. Then \u25e6 satisfies [L2], [L3], [L4\u2217], [L5\u2217], [L6\u2217], and [L7].\n2. The first observation is only discarded under the assumption that recent information takes precedence.\nAs discussed previously, we are not committed to this assumption, but it is useful for the purpose of comparison with iterated belief revision.\nProof Since \u03b1 6= \u2205, \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1) = \u03ba \u2217 \u03b3 for some \u03b3 \u2286 \u03b1. Hence \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1) \u2286 \u03b3 \u2286 \u03b1, which proves [L2].\nFor [L3], suppose that \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1) \u2286 \u03b2 and \u03ba \u25e6O \u2286 \u03b1. Now suppose that s \u2208 \u03ba \u25e6O. By definition, this means that s \u2208 \u03ba\u2217 \u22c2 \u03c4(O). By postulate [AGM7], we have (\u03ba\u2217 \u22c2\n\u03c4(O))\u2229\u03b1 \u2286 \u03ba \u2217 ( \u22c2 \u03c4(O) \u2229 \u03b1). But \u03ba \u2217 ( \u22c2\n\u03c4(O) \u2229 \u03b1) = \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1), so it follows that s \u2208 \u03b2. Therefore \u03ba \u25e6O \u2286 \u03b2.\nSuppose that \u03ba \u25e6 O \u2286 \u03b1 and O 6= \u2205\u0304. By definition, \u03ba \u25e6 O = \u03ba \u2217 \u22c2\n\u03c4(O). Since O 6= \u2205\u0304, it follows that \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1) = \u03ba \u2217 ( \u22c2\n\u03c4(O) \u2229 \u03b1). With these equalities in mind, the following results prove that [L4\u2217] holds:\n\u03ba \u2217 \u22c2 \u03c4(O) \u2286 (\u03ba \u2217 \u22c2 \u03c4(O)) \u2229 \u03b1 (since \u03ba \u25e6O \u2286 \u03b1)\n\u2286 \u03ba \u2217 ( \u22c2 \u03c4(O) \u2229 \u03b1) (by [AGM7]) \u2286 \u03ba \u2217 \u22c2 \u03c4(O) (by [AGM8])\nIt is clear that [L5\u2217] holds, simply because the assumption that \u03b2 \u2286 \u03b1 implies that \u03b2 = \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2.\nFor [L6\u2217], suppose that \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1) 6\u2286 \u03b2\u0303. It follows that \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2 6= \u2205. By definition, this means that \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03b2) = \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2), which is the desired result.\nSince \u03b1\u0303 \u2229 \u03b1 = \u2205, it follows by definition that \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1) = \u03ba \u25e6 (O \u00b7 \u03b1\u0303 \u00b7 \u03b1). 2\nHence, if we do not consider the influence of observations that will occur in the future, then belief evolution defines an approach to iterated revision that satisfies all of the Lehmann postulates that do not deal with empty belief states.\nWe conclude with a brief remark about the assumption that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are non-empty in Propositions 11 and 12. In our framework, action histories take precedence over observations. As such, empty observations are discarded because they are inconsistent with every sequence of actions. This is true even in the case when A\u0304 is a sequence of null actions. We accept this treatment of inconsistent observations, because it allows inconsistency to be treated in a uniform manner."}, {"heading": "7. Discussion", "text": "We have presented a transition system framework for reasoning about belief change due to actions and observations. We suggested that agents should perform belief update following an action, and they should perform belief revision following an observation. We showed that the interaction between update and revision can be non-elementary. Consequently we specified how an agent should consider the history of actions when incorporating a new observation. In contrast, existing formalisms for reasoning about epistemic action effects either ignore the interaction between revision and update or they deal with it implicitly. Hence, we have provided an explicit treatment of a phenomenon that has not always been recognised in related formalisms.\nThe fundamental idea motivating this work is that the interpretation of an observation may depend on the preceding sequence of actions. Our treatment of iterated belief change includes two main components. First, we introduce a set of postulates that capture our intuitions about the appropriate treatment of an observation following a sequence of actions.\nInformally, our postulates capture the intuitions of AGM revision for domains where actions may occur. Second, we introduce belief evolution operators to give a concrete recipe for combining a given update operator with a given revision operator. Belief evolution operators satisfy our postulates, along with some standard postulates for iterated revision.\nThe class of problems that are appropriate for belief evolution can be described by an ordering over action histories. Let A1, \u03b11, . . . , An, \u03b1n be an alternating sequence of actions and observations. Let denote a total pre-order over the elements of this sequence. Belief evolution is suitable for problems in which the underlying ordering is given as follows, for some permutation p1, . . . , pn of 1, . . . , n.\nA1 ... An\n\n \n \n\u03b1p1 \u03b1p2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03b1pn\nHence belief evolution is appropriate when we have any total pre-order over observations, including the case where all observations are considered equally reliable. However, we have not addressed the case where action histories may be incorrect.\nWe have framed our results in a transition system framework, primarily because it provides a simple representation of action effects. However, our results can be translated into related action formalisms as well. For example, in our comparison with the SitCalc, we illustrated that the revision actions of the SitCalc are implicitly defined in terms of belief evolution. Our results provide a general account of the interaction between actions and observations, grounded in the context of transition systems.\nIt is worth noting that belief evolution operators model a specific reasoning problem that has been addressed in more general formalisms. For example, in our own work, we have explored the use of arbitrary plausibility rankings over both actions and observations to reason about iterated belief change (Hunter & Delgrande, 2006). Moreover, even the distinction between revision and update can be understood as a pragmatic distinction for modelling certain kinds of reasoning. A single generic notion of \u201cbelief change\u201d has been defined such that belief revision and belief update are both special cases (Kern-Isberner, 2008). From this perspective, iterated belief change due to action is simply one particular instance; it is an instance where the belief change operations are subject to certain constraints that encode the effects of actions. We believe this is an important instance that is worthy of detailed study, but it is important to be aware that it can be framed and understood at a more general level.\nThere are several directions for future research. One direction deals with the implementation of a belief evolution solver. We have previously explored the use of Answer Set Planning to develop a solver for iterated belief change (Hunter, Delgrande, & Faber, 2007), and we believe this approach could be further developed. Another important direction for future research involves relaxing the assumption that action histories are correct. In realistic action domains, agents may be incorrect about the actions that have occurred. In such domains, it is not always reasonable to discard an observation that is inconsistent with the perceived action history. Instead, an agent should consider the likelihood that the observation is correct as well as the likelihood that the action history is correct. Hence, the most plausible histories can be determined by considering the relative plausibility of each\naction and observation. Belief evolution operators can be seen as a specific case of this kind of reasoning, in which action occurrences are always more plausible than observations."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change: Partial meet functions for contraction and revision", "author": ["C.

Our belief change operators can be characterized in terms of a natural shifting operation on total pre-orderings over interpretations. We compare our approach with related work on iterated belief change due to action, and we conclude with some directions for future research.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.98 Copyright 2009 Radical Eye Software"}}}
