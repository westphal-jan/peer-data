Introduction", "text": "While reactive systems (Pnueli, 1977) are traditionally specified using plain temporal logic, there is a well-established tradition in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, in particular, MultiAgent Systems (MAS) research to adopt more expressive languages. Much of this tradition is inspired by the earlier, seminal work in AI by McCarthy (1979, 1990) and others aimed at adopting an \u201cintentional stance\u201d (Dennett, 1987) when reasoning about intelligent systems. Specifically, logics for knowledge (Fagin, Halpern, Moses, & Vardi, 1995), beliefs, desires, intentions, obligations, etc., have been put forward to represent the informational and motivational attitudes of agents in the system. Theoretical explorations have focused on the soundness and completeness of a number of axiomatisations as well as the decidability and computational complexity of the corresponding logics.\nThe great majority of work in these lines focuses on propositional languages. Yet, specifications supporting quantification are increasingly required in applications. For example, it is often necessary to refer to different individuals at different instances of time.\nQuantified modal languages (Garson, 2001) have long attracted considerable attention. Early work included analysing the philosophical and logical implications of different setups for the quantification domains, particularly in combination with temporal concepts. More recently, considerable attention has been given to identifying suitable fragments that preserve completeness and decidability, and then studying the resulting computational complexity of the satisfiability problem. This article follows this direction.\nIn more detail, we investigate the meta-theoretical properties of monodic fragments of quantified temporal-epistemic logic where interactions between quantifiers, time, and knowledge of the agents are present. There is a deep-rooted interest (Fagin et al., 1995; Meyden, 1994) in understanding the implications of interaction axioms in this context, as they often express interesting properties of MAS, including \u201cperfect recall\u201d, \u201csynchronicity\u201d,\nc\u00a92012 AI Access Foundation.

These features are well-understood at the propositional level (Fagin, Halpern, & Vardi, 1992; Halpern, van der Meyden, & Vardi, 2004) and are commonly used in several application areas. The technical question this paper aims to resolve is whether a similar range of results can be provided in the presence of (limited forms of) quantification. As we shall demonstrate, the answer to this question is largely positive."}, {"heading": "1.1 State of the Art", "text": "The analysis and application of temporal-epistemic logic in a first-order setting has an established tradition in AI. One of the early contributions is the work of Moore (1990), which presents a theory of action that takes into consideration the epistemic preconditions to actions and their effects on knowledge. More recently, a number of first-order temporalepistemic logics for reasoning about MAS were introduced by Wooldridge et al. (2002, 2006, 1999), often in the context of the MABLE programming language for agents. The same authors introduced a first-order branching time temporal logic for MAS (Wooldridge & Fisher, 1992), and developed it in a series of papers (Wooldridge et al., 2002, 2006). First-order multi-modal logics also constitute the conceptual base of a number of other agent theories, such as BDI logics (Rao & Georgeff, 1991), the KQML framework (Cohen & Levesque, 1995), and the LORA framework (Wooldridge, 2000b). All of these include operators for mental attitudes (e.g., knowledge, belief, intention, desire, etc.), as well as temporal and dynamic operators with some form of quantification. However, most of the current literature has so far fallen short of a systematic analysis of the formal properties of these frameworks. Some of the frameworks above are so rich that they are unlikely to be finitely axiomatisable, let alone decidable. Still, these earlier contributions are an inspiration to the present investigation, as they are among the few to have explicitly addressed the subject of first-order temporal-epistemic languages in a MAS setting.\nAt a purely theoretical level, first-order temporal and epistemic logics have also received increasing attention with a range of contributions on axiomatisability (Degtyarev et al., 2003; Sturm et al., 2000; Wolter & Zakharyaschev, 2002), decidability (Degtyarev et al., 2002; Hodkinson et al., 2000; Wolter & Zakharyaschev, 2001), and complexity (Hodkinson, 2006; Hodkinson et al., 2003). Wolter and Zakharyaschev (2001) introduced the monodic fragment of quantified modal logic, where the modal operators are restricted to formulas with at most one free variable, and they proved the decidability of various fragments. Similar results have been obtained for monodic fragments of first-order temporal logic (Hodkinson, 2002; Hodkinson et al., 2000), and the computational complexity of these formalisms have been analysed (Hodkinson, 2006; Hodkinson et al., 2003). Further, Wolter and Zakharyaschev (2002) provided a complete axiomatisation of the monodic first-order validities on the natural numbers. The monodic fragment of first-order epistemic logic has also been explored (Sturm et al., 2000; Sturm, Wolter, & Zakharyaschev, 2002), and an axiomatisation including common knowledge has been provided. These lines of research constitute the theoretical background against which this research is set.\nThe contributions discussed previously used plain Kripke models as the underlying semantics. However, it has been argued though that in applications a \u201ccomputationallygrounded\u201d semantics (Wooldridge, 2000a) is preferable, as this enables systems to be modelled directly. We introduced quantified interpreted systems (QIS) to fill this gap (Belar-\ndinelli & Lomuscio, 2009). This enabled us to provide a complete axiomatisation of the monodic fragment of quantified temporal-epistemic logic on linear time (Belardinelli & Lomuscio, 2011). However, no interaction between temporal and epistemic modalities was studied. Preliminary investigations into the interactions between temporal and epistemic operators in a first-order setting have already appeared (Belardinelli & Lomuscio, 2010). In this paper we extend the previous results and also consider epistemic languages containing the common knowledge operator."}, {"heading": "1.2 The Present Contribution", "text": "This paper extends the current state of the art in first-order temporal-epistemic logic by introducing a family of provably complete calculi for a variety of quantified interpreted systems characterising a range of properties including perfect recall, no learning, synchronicity, and having a unique initial state. We prove the completeness of the presented first-order temporal-epistemic logics via a quasimodel construction, which has previously been used (Hodkinson, Wolter, & Zakharyaschev, 2002; Hodkinson et al., 2000) to prove decidability for monodic fragments of first-order temporal logic (FoTL). Quasimodels have also been applied to first-order temporal as well as epistemic logic (Sturm et al., 2000; Wolter & Zakharyaschev, 2002). Wolter et al. (2002) present a complete axiomatisation for the monodic fragment of FoTL on the natural numbers; a similar result for a variety of first-order epistemic logics with common knowledge has also appeared (Sturm et al., 2000). However, the interaction between temporal and epistemic modalities in a first order setting has not been taken into account yet, nor has the interpreted systems semantics. Nonetheless, both of these features are essential for applications to multi-agent systems and are the subject of analysis here."}, {"heading": "1.2.1 Structure of the Paper.", "text": "In Section 2 we first introduce the first-order temporal-epistemic languages Lm and LCm with common knowledge for a set Ag = {1, . . . ,m} of agents.

We follow the definition of QIS provided in the references."}, {"heading": "2.1 First-Order Temporal-Epistemic Languages", "text": "Given a set Ag = {1, . . . ,m} of agents, the first-order temporal-epistemic language Lm contains individual variables x1, x2, . . ., individual constants c1, c2, . . ., n-ary predicate constants Pn1 , P n 2 , . . ., for n \u2208 N, the propositional connectives \u00ac and \u2192, the quantifier \u2200, the linear time operators \u00a9 and U , and the epistemic operator Ki for each agent i \u2208 Ag. The language LCm also contains the common knowledge operator C (Fagin et al., 1992). For simplicity we consider only one group of agents for the common knowledge modality, that is, the whole of Ag; C is really tantamount to CAg. The extension to proper non-empty subsets of Ag is not problematic.\nThe languages Lm and LCm contain no symbol for functions; so all terms t1, t2, . . . in these languages are either individual variables or constants.\nDefinition 1. Formulas in Lm are defined in the Backus-Naur form as follows:\n\u03c6 ::= P k(t1, . . . , tk) | \u00ac\u03c8 | \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8\u2032 | \u2200x\u03c8 | \u00a9\u03c8 | \u03c8U\u03c8\u2032 | Ki\u03c8\nThe language LCm extends Lm with the following clause:\n\u2022 if \u03c6 is a formula in LCm, then also C\u03c6 is a formula in LCm.\nThe formulas\u00a9\u03c6 and \u03c6U\u03c6\u2032 are read as \u201cat the next step \u03c6\u201d and \u201ceventually \u03c6\u2032 and until then \u03c6\u201d respectively. The formula Ki\u03c6 represents \u201cagent i knows \u03c6\u201d, while C\u03c6 stands for \u201c\u03c6 is common knowledge\u201d in the set Ag of agents.\nWe define the symbols \u2227, \u2228,\u2194, \u2203, G (always in the future), F (some time in the future) as standard. Further, we introduce some abbreviations. The operator K\u0304i is dual to Ki, that is, K\u0304i\u03c6 is defined as \u00acKi\u00ac\u03c6, while E\u03c6 is a shorthand for \u2227 i\u2208AgKi\u03c6. For k \u2208 N, Ek\u03c6 is defined as follows: E0\u03c6 = \u03c6 and Ek+1\u03c6 = EEk\u03c6. The formulas K\u0304i\u03c6 and E\u03c6 are read as \u201cagent i considers \u03c6 possible\u201d and \u201cevery agent knows \u03c6\u201d respectively.\nFree and bound variables are defined as standard. By \u03c6[~y] we mean that ~y = y1, . . . , yn are all the free variables in \u03c6. Additionally, \u03c6[~y/~t] is the formula obtained by substituting simultaneously some, possibly all, free occurrences of ~y in \u03c6 with ~t = t1, . . . , tn while renaming bound variables. A sentence is a formula with no free variables."}, {"heading": "2.2 Quantified Interpreted Systems", "text": "To introduce quantified interpreted systems we assume a set Li of local states li, l\u2032i, . . . for each agent i \u2208 Ag in a multi-agent system. We consider a set Le of local states for the environment e as well. The set S \u2286 Le\u00d7L1\u00d7 . . .\u00d7Lm contains all and only the global states of the multi-agent system. To represent the temporal evolution of the MAS we consider the flow of time N of natural numbers; a run is a function r : N \u2192 S. Intuitively, a run represents one possible evolution of the MAS assuming N as the flow of time. Given the above, we define quantified interpreted systems for the languages Lm and LCm as follows:\nDefinition 2 (QIS). A quantified interpreted system is a triple P = \u3008R,D, I\u3009 where:\n\u2022 R is a non-empty set of runs;\n\u2022 D is a non-empty set of individuals;\n\u2022 for r \u2208 R, n \u2208 N, I is a first-order interpretation, that is, a function such that\n\u2013 for every constant c, I(c, r(n)) \u2208 D, \u2013 for every predicate constant P k, I(P k, r(n)) is a k-ary relation on D.\nFurther, for every r, r\u2032 \u2208 R, n, n\u2032 \u2208 N, I(c, r(n)) = I(c, r\u2032(n\u2032)).\nNotice that we assume a unique domain of interpretation, as well as a fixed interpretation for individual constants; so we simply write I(c). Following standard notation (Fagin et al., 1995), for r \u2208 R and n \u2208 N, a pair (r, n) is a point in P. If r(n) = \u3008le, l1, . . . , lm\u3009 is the global state at point (r, n) then re(n) = le and ri(n) = li are the environment\u2019s and agent i\u2019s local state at (r, n) respectively. Further, for i \u2208 Ag the epistemic equivalence relation \u223ci is defined such that (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff ri(n) = r\u2032i(n\u2032). Clearly, each \u223ci is an equivalence relation. Two points (r, n) and (r\u2032, n\u2032) are said to be epistemically reachable, or simply reachable, if (r, n) \u223c (r\u2032, n\u2032) where \u223c is the transitive closure of \u22c3 i\u2208Ag \u223ci.\nIn this paper we consider the following classes of QIS.\nDefinition 3. A quantified interpreted system P satisfies\nsynchronicity iff for every i \u2208 Ag, for all points (r, n), (r\u2032, n\u2032), (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) implies n = n\u2032\nperfect recall for agent i iff for all points (r, n), (r\u2032, n\u2032), if (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) and n > 0 then either (r, n\u2212 1) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) or there is k < n\u2032 such that (r, n\u2212 1) \u223ci (r\u2032, k) and for all k\u2032, k < k\u2032 \u2264 n\u2032 implies (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, k\u2032)\nno learning for agent i iff for all points (r, n), (r\u2032, n\u2032), if (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) then either (r, n+ 1) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) or there is k > n\u2032 such that (r, n+ 1) \u223ci (r\u2032, k) and for all k\u2032, k > k\u2032 \u2265 n\u2032 implies (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, k\u2032)\nunique initial state iff for all r, r\u2032 \u2208 R, r(0) = r\u2032(0)\nThese conditions have extensively been discussed in the literature (Halpern et al., 2004) together with equivalent formulations. Intuitively, a QIS is synchronous if time is part of the local state of each agent. A QIS satisfies perfect recall for agent i if i\u2019s local state records everything that has happened to him (from the agent\u2019s point of view) so far in the run. No learning is dual to perfect recall: agent i does not acquire any new knowledge during a run. Finally, a QIS has a unique initial state if all runs start from the same global state.\nA QIS P satisfies perfect recall (resp. no learning) if P satisfies perfect recall (resp. no learning) for all agents. We denote the class of QIS with m agents asQISm; the superscripts pr, nl, sync, uis denote the subclasses of QISm satisfying perfect recall, no learning, synchronicity, and having a unique initial state respectively. For instance, QISsync,uism is the class of all synchronous QIS with m agents and having a unique initial state.\nWe now assign an interpretation to the formulas in Lm and LCm by means of quantified interpreted systems. Let \u03c3 be an assignment from variables to individuals inD, the valuation\nI\u03c3(t) of a term t is defined as \u03c3(y) for t = y, and I\u03c3(t) = I(c) for t = c. A variant \u03c3xa of an assignment \u03c3 assigns a \u2208 D to x and agrees with \u03c3 on all other variables.\nDefinition 4. The satisfaction of a formula \u03c6 \u2208 Lm at point (r, n) \u2208 P under an assignment \u03c3, denoted (P\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c6, is defined inductively as follows:\n(P\u03c3, r, n) |= P k(t1, . . . , tk) iff \u3008I\u03c3(t1), . . . , I\u03c3(tk)\u3009 \u2208 I(P k, r(n)) (P\u03c3, r, n) |= \u00ac\u03c8 iff (P\u03c3, r, n) 6|= \u03c8 (P\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8\u2032 iff (P\u03c3, r, n) 6|= \u03c8 or (P\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c8\u2032 (P\u03c3, r, n) |= \u2200x\u03c8 iff for all a \u2208 D, (P\u03c3xa , r, n) |= \u03c8 (P\u03c3, r, n) |=\u00a9\u03c8 iff (P\u03c3, r, n+ 1) |= \u03c8 (P\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c8U\u03c8\u2032 iff there is n\u2032 \u2265 n such that (P\u03c3, r, n\u2032) |= \u03c8\u2032 and (P\u03c3, r, n\u2032\u2032) |= \u03c8 for all n \u2264 n\u2032\u2032 < n\u2032 (P\u03c3, r, n) |= Ki\u03c8 iff for all r\u2032, n\u2032, (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) implies (P\u03c3, r\u2032, n\u2032) |= \u03c8\nFor \u03c6 \u2208 LCm we have to consider also the case for the common knowledge operator:\n(P\u03c3, r, n) |= C\u03c8 iff for all k \u2208 N, (P\u03c3, r, n) |= Ek\u03c8\nThe truth conditions for \u2227, \u2228, \u2194, \u2203, G and F are defined from those above. From the definition above it follows that (P\u03c3, r, n) |= C\u03c8 iff for all (r\u2032, n\u2032) reachable from (r, n), (P\u03c3, r\u2032, n\u2032) |= \u03c8.\nA formula \u03c6 is true at a point (r, n) if it is satisfied at (r, n) by every assignment \u03c3; \u03c6 is true on a QIS P if it is true at every point in P; \u03c6 is valid on a class C of QIS if it is true on every QIS in C. Further, a formula \u03c6 is satisfiable on a QIS P if it is satisfied at some point in P, for some assignment \u03c3; \u03c6 is satisfiable on a class C of QIS if it is satisfiable on some QIS in C.\nBy considering all combinations of pr, nl, sync and uis we obtain 16 subclasses of QISm for any m \u2208 N. Not all of them are independent, nor axiomatisable. Indeed, some of these are not axiomatisable even at the propositional level (Halpern & Moses, 1992; Halpern & Vardi, 1989). In the first column of Table 1 we group together the classes of QIS that share the same set of validities on the languages Lm and LCm. The proofs of these equivalences are similar to those of the propositional case (Halpern et al., 2004) and are not reported here. Further, we define the languages PLm and PLCm as the propositional fragments of Lm and LCm respectively (formally, PLm and PLCm are obtained by restricting atomic formulas to 0-ary predicate constants p1, p2, . . .). Table 1 summarises the results by Halpern et al. (2004) concerning the axiomatisability of propositional validities in PLm and PLCm. Observe that, as regards the language PLm, for m = 1 all sets of validities on the various classes of QIS are axiomatisable, while for m \u2265 2 no axiomatisation can be given for QISnl,uism and QISnl,pr,uism (Halpern & Vardi, 1986, 1989). As to the language PLCm, we restrict to the case for m \u2265 2, as for m = 1 PLCm has the same expressive power as PLm. For m \u2265 2 no class of validities on PLCm has a recursive axiomatisation but QISm, QISsyncm , QISuism , QISsync,uism and QISnl,sync,uism , QISnl,pr,sync,uism .\nIn the next section we show that the axiomatisability results at the propositional level can be lifted to the monodic fragment of the languages Lm and LCm."}, {"heading": "2.3 The Monodic Fragment", "text": "In the rest of the paper we will show that a sufficient condition for lifting the results in Table 1 to the first-order case is to restrict the languages Lm and LCm to their monodic fragments.\nDefinition 5. The monodic fragment L1m is the set of formulas \u03c6 \u2208 Lm such that any subformula of \u03c6 of the form Ki\u03c8, \u00a9\u03c8, or \u03c81U\u03c82 contains at most one free variable. Similarly, the monodic fragment LC1m is the set of formulas \u03c6 \u2208 LCm such that any subformula of \u03c6 of the form Ki\u03c8, C\u03c8, \u00a9\u03c8, or \u03c81U\u03c82 contains at most one free variable.\nThe monodic fragments of a number of first-order modal logics have been thoroughly investigated in the literature (Hodkinson et al., 2000, 2003; Wolter & Zakharyaschev, 2001, 2002). In the case of Lm and LCm these fragments are quite expressive as they contain formulas like the following:\n\u2200y C(\u2200zAvailable(y, z)U\u2203xRequest(x, y)) (1)\nKi\u00a9\u2200xyz(Request(x, y)\u2192 Available(y, z))\u2192 \u2192\u00a9Ki\u2200xyz(Request(x, y)\u2192 Available(y, z)) (2)\nFormula (1) intuitively states that it is common knowledge that every resource y will eventually be requested by somebody, but until that time the resource remains available to everybody. Notice that y is the only free variable within the scope of modal operators U and C. Formula (2) represents that if agent i knows that at the next step every resource is available whenever it is requested, then at the next step agent i knows that this is indeed the case. However, note that the formula\n\u2200xKi(Process(x)\u2192 \u2200yFAccess(x, y))\nwhich intuitively means that agent i knows that every process will eventually try to access every resource, is not in L1m as both x and y occur free within the scope of modal operator F . Still, the monodic fragments of Lm and LCm are quite expressive as they contain all de dicto formulas, i.e., formulas where no free variable appears in the scope of any modal operator, as in (2). So, the limitation is really only on de re formulas.\nWe stress the fact that the formulas above have no propositional equivalent in the case that they are interepreted on quantified interpreted systems in which the domain of quantification is infinite, or its cardinality cannot be bounded in advance.\nFinally, observe that the Barcan formulas \u00a9\u2200x\u03c6 \u2194 \u2200x \u00a9 \u03c6 and Ki\u2200x\u03c6 \u2194 \u2200xKi\u03c6 are both true in all quantified interpreted systems, as each QIS includes a unique domain of quantification. This implies that the universal quantifier commutes with the temporal modality\u00a9 and the epistemic modality Ki. Thus, it can be the case that for some formulas \u03c8, \u03c8\u2032 \u2208 Lm, we have that \u03c8 \u2194 \u03c8\u2032 is a validity, but \u03c8 \u2208 L1m and \u03c8\u2032 /\u2208 L1m. For instance, consider \u03c8 = \u00a9\u2200xP (x, y) and \u03c8\u2032 = \u2200x\u00a9 P (x, y). We will see that this remark does not interfere with our results."}, {"heading": "3. Axiomatisations", "text": "In this section we present sound and complete axiomatisations of the sets of monodic validities for the classes of quantified interpreted systems in Section 2.

The system QKTm contains the following schemes of axioms and rules, where \u03c6, \u03c8 and \u03c7 are formulas in L1m and =\u21d2 is the inference relation.\nFirst-order logic Taut classical propositional tautologies MP \u03c6\u2192 \u03c8, \u03c6 =\u21d2 \u03c8 Ex \u2200x\u03c6\u2192 \u03c6[x/t] Gen \u03c6\u2192 \u03c8[x/t] =\u21d2 \u03c6\u2192 \u2200x\u03c8, where x is not free in \u03c6 Temporal logic K \u00a9(\u03c6\u2192 \u03c8)\u2192 (\u00a9\u03c6\u2192\u00a9\u03c8) T1 \u00a9\u00ac\u03c6\u2194 \u00ac\u00a9 \u03c6 T2 \u03c6U\u03c8 \u2194 \u03c8 \u2228 (\u03c6 \u2227\u00a9(\u03c6U\u03c8)) Nec \u03c6 =\u21d2\u00a9\u03c6 T3 \u03c7\u2192 \u00ac\u03c8 \u2227\u00a9\u03c7 =\u21d2 \u03c7\u2192 \u00ac(\u03c6U\u03c8) Epistemic logic K Ki(\u03c6\u2192 \u03c8)\u2192 (Ki\u03c6\u2192 Ki\u03c8) T Ki\u03c6\u2192 \u03c6 4 Ki\u03c6\u2192 KiKi\u03c6 5 \u00acKi\u03c6\u2192 Ki\u00acKi\u03c6 Nec \u03c6 =\u21d2 Ki\u03c6\nThe operator Ki is an S5 modality, while the next\u00a9 and until U operators are axiomatised as linear-time modalities (Fagin et al., 1995). To this we add the classical postulates Ex and Gen for quantification, which are both sound as we consider a unique domain of individuals in the quantified interpreted systems.\nDefinition 7. The system QKTCm extends QKTm with the following schemes of axioms for common knowledge, where \u03c6, \u03c8 and \u03c7 are formulas in LC1m and =\u21d2 is the inference relation.\nC1 C\u03c6\u2194 (\u03c6 \u2227 EC\u03c6) C2 \u03c6\u2192 (\u03c8 \u2227 E\u03c6) =\u21d2 \u03c6\u2192 C\u03c8\nWe consider the standard definitions of proof and theorem; `S \u03c6 means that the formula \u03c6 is a theorem in the formal system S. We remark that the Barcan formula (BF ) 2\u2200x\u03c6\u2194 \u2200x2\u03c6 is provable for any unary modal operator 2 by the axioms K and Ex, and the rules MP and Gen. The notions of soundness and completeness of a system S with respect to a class C of QIS are defined as standard: S is sound w.r.t. C if for all \u03c6, S ` \u03c6 implies C |= \u03c6. Similarly, S is complete w.r.t. C if for all \u03c6, C |= \u03c6 implies S ` \u03c6.\nIn this paper we focus on the schemes of axioms in Table 2 that specify key interactions between time and knowledge (Halpern et al., 2004). We use 1, . . . , 5 as superscripts to denote\nthe systems obtained by adding to QKTm or QKTCm any combination of KT1-KT5. For instance, the system QKTC2,3m extends QKTCm with the axioms KT2 and KT3.\nIt is straightforward to check that the axioms of QKTm and QKTCm are valid on every QIS and the inference rules preserve validity. However, the axioms KT1-KT5 are valid only on specific classes of QIS as stated in the following Remark.\nRemark 1. A QIS P satisfies any of the axioms KT1-KT5 in the first column if P satisfies the corresponding semantical condition in the second column.\nAxiom Condition on QIS KT1 perfect recall KT2 perfect recall, synchronicity KT3 no learning KT4 no learning, synchronicity KT5 all agents share the same knowledge, i.e.,\nfor all i, j \u2208 Ag, (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff (r, n) \u223cj (r\u2032, n\u2032).\nThese results can be shown in a similar way to the propositional case (Halpern et al., 2004); so the proofs are omitted.\nBy using Remark 1 we can prove soundness results for all our first-order temporalepistemic systems.\nTheorem 1 (Soundness). The systems reported in the first and second column of the following table are sound w.r.t. the corresponding classes of QIS in the third column.\nSystems QIS QKTm QKTCm QISm, QISsyncm , QISuism , QISsync,uism QKT 1m QKTC 1 m QISprm , QISpr,uism QKT 2m QKTC 2 m QISpr,syncm , QISpr,sync,uism QKT 3m QKTC 3 m QISnlm, QISnl,uism QKT 4m QKTC 4 m QISnl,syncm QKT 2,3m QKTC 2,3 m QISnl,prm , QISnl,pr,uism QKT 1,4m QKTC 1,4 m QISnl,pr,syncm QKT 1,4,5m QKTC 1,4,5 m QISnl,sync,uism , QISnl,pr,sync,uism\nProof. These results follow from Remark 1 by a line of reasoning similar to that used in the propositional case (Fagin et al., 1995; Halpern et al., 2004). Notice that if a quantified interpreted systems P satisfies no learning, synchronicity, and has a unique initial state, then P satisfies also perfect recall, that is, P \u2208 QISnl,sync,uism implies P \u2208 QISnl,pr,sync,uism . Further, all agents share the same knowledge, therefore KT5 holds in P.\nAs we anticipated above, not all calculi are complete w.r.t. the corresponding classes of quantified interpreted systems in Theorem 1. In the next theorem we summarise the completeness results that will be proved in the rest of this paper.\nTheorem 2 (Completeness). The systems reported in the first and second column of the following table are complete w.r.t. the corresponding classes of QIS in the third column.\nSystems QIS QKTm QKTCm QISm, QISsyncm , QISuism , QISsync,uism QKT 1m QISprm , QISpr,uism QKT 2m QISpr,syncm , QISpr,sync,uism QKT 3m QISnlm QKT 4m QISnl,syncm QKT 2,3m QISnl,prm QKT 1,4m QISnl,pr,syncm QKT 2,31 QIS nl,uis 1 , QIS nl,pr,uis 1 QKT 1,4,5m QKTC 1,4,5 m QISnl,sync,uism , QISnl,pr,sync,uism\nWe observe that, as regards the language L1m, the sets of monodic validities are axiomatisable for all classes introduced but QISnl,uism and QISnl,pr,uism . However, for L11 we have that QISnl,uis1 and QIS nl,pr,uis 1 are equivalent to QIS nl,pr 1 . Thus, the sets of monodic validities on QISnl,pr,uis1 and QIS nl,uis 1 are axiomatised by QKT 2,3 1 .\nAs regards the language LC1m, only the set of monodic validities on QISm, QISsyncm , QISuism ,QISsync,uism are axiomatisable, as well as those onQISnl,sync,uism andQISnl,pr,sync,uism . All other classes are not recursively axiomatisable, as this is the case already at the propositional level (Halpern & Moses, 1992; Halpern & Vardi, 1986, 1989).\nFor proving the completeness results reported above we introduce Kripke models as a generalisation of quantified interpreted systems."}, {"heading": "3.1 Kripke Models", "text": "To prove the completeness results in Theorem 2, we first introduce an appropriate class of Kripke models as a generalisation of QIS and prove completeness for these models. Then we apply a correspondence result between Kripke models and QIS to obtain the desired results.\nDefinition 8 (Kripke model). A Kripke model is a tuple M = \u3008W,RW , {\u223ci}i\u2208Ag,D, I\u3009 such that\n\u2022 W is a non-empty set of states;\n\u2022 RW is a non-empty set of functions r : N\u2192W ;\n\u2022 for every agent i \u2208 Ag, \u223ci is an equivalence relation on W ;\n\u2022 D is a non-empty set of individuals;\n\u2022 for every w \u2208W , I is a first-order interpretation, that is, a function such that\n\u2013 for every constant c, I(c, w) \u2208 D, \u2013 for every predicate constant P k, I(P k, w) is a k-ary relation on D.\nFurther, for every w,w\u2032 \u2208W , I(c, w) = I(c, w\u2032). Notice that Def. 8 differs from other notions of Kripke model in that it includes the set RW of functions to guarantee that the correspondence between Kripke models and QIS is one-to-one. We also assume a unique domain of interpretation, as well as a fixed interpretation for individual constants, so also in this case we simply write I(c). Kripke models are a generalisation of QIS in that they do not specify the inner structure of the states in W . Also for Kripke models we introduce points as pairs (r, n) for r \u2208 RW and n \u2208 N. A point derives its properties from the corresponding state; for instance, (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) if r(n) \u223ci r\u2032(n\u2032).\nWe consider Kripke models satisfying synchronicity, perfect recall, no learning, and having a unique initial state. The definition of these subclasses is analogous to Def. 3.\nDefinition 9. A Kripke model M satisfies synchronicity iff for every i \u2208 Ag, for all points (r, n), (r\u2032, n\u2032),\n(r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) implies n = n\u2032\nperfect recall for agent i iff for all points (r, n), (r\u2032, n\u2032), if (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) and n > 0 then either (r, n\u2212 1) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) or there is k < n\u2032 such that (r, n\u2212 1) \u223ci (r\u2032, k) and for all k\u2032, k < k\u2032 \u2264 n\u2032 implies (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, k\u2032).\nno learning for agent i iff for all points (r, n), (r\u2032, n\u2032), if (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) then either (r, n+ 1) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) or there is k > n\u2032 such that (r, n+ 1) \u223ci (r\u2032, k) and for all k\u2032, k > k\u2032 \u2265 n\u2032 implies (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, k\u2032).\nunique initial state iff for all r, r\u2032 \u2208 RW , r(0) = r\u2032(0).\nNow let Km be the class of Kripke models with m agents. Hereafter we adopt the same naming conventions as for QIS; for instance, Ksync,uism is the class of synchronous Kripke models with m agents and having a unique initial state. Further, the inductive clauses for the satisfaction relation |= with respect to an assignment \u03c3 are straightforwardly defined from those for QIS, as well as the notions of truth and validity.\nDefinition 10. The satisfaction of a formula \u03c6 \u2208 Lm (resp. LCm) at point (r, n) \u2208M for an assignment \u03c3, or (M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c6, is inductively defined as follows:\n(M\u03c3, r, n) |= P k(t1, . . . , tk) iff \u3008I\u03c3(t1), . . . , I\u03c3(tk)\u3009 \u2208 I(P k, r(n)) (M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u00ac\u03c8 iff (M\u03c3, r, n) 6|= \u03c8 (M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8\u2032 iff (M\u03c3, r, n) 6|= \u03c8 or (M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c8\u2032 (M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u2200x\u03c8 iff for all a \u2208 D, (M\u03c3xa , r, n) |= \u03c8 (M\u03c3, r, n) |=\u00a9\u03c8 iff (M\u03c3, r, n+ 1) |= \u03c8 (M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c8U\u03c8\u2032 iff there is n\u2032 \u2265 n such that (M\u03c3, r, n\u2032) |= \u03c8\u2032 and n \u2264 n\u2032\u2032 < n\u2032 implies (M\u03c3, r, n\u2032\u2032) |= \u03c8 (M\u03c3, r, n) |= Ki\u03c8 iff for all r\u2032, n\u2032, (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) implies (M\u03c3, r\u2032, n\u2032) |= \u03c8 (M\u03c3, r, n) |= C\u03c8 iff for all k \u2208 N, (M\u03c3, r, n) |= Ek\u03c8\nA formula \u03c6 is true at a point (r, n) if it is satisfied at (r, n) by every assignment \u03c3; \u03c6 is true on a Kripke model M if it is true at every point in M; \u03c6 is valid on a class C of Kripke models if it is true on every Kripke model in C. Further, a formula \u03c6 is satisfiable on a Kripke model M if it is satisfied at some point in M, for some assignment \u03c3; \u03c6 is satisfiable on a class C of Kripke models if it is satisfiable on some Kripke model in C.\nWe relate Kripke models and quantified interpreted systems by means of a map g : Km \u2192 QISm (Lomuscio & Ryan, 1998). Let M = \u3008W,RW , {\u223ci}i\u2208Ag,D, I\u3009 be a Kripke model. For every agent i \u2208 Ag, for (r, n) \u2208M, let the equivalence class [(r, n)]i = {(r\u2032, n\u2032) | (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032)} be a local state for agent i; while each (r, n) is a local state for the environment. Then define g(M) as the tuple \u3008R\u2032,D, I \u2032\u3009 where R\u2032 contains the runs rr for r \u2208 RW such that rr(n) = \u3008(r, n), [(r, n)]1, . . . , [(r, n)]m\u3009. Further, D is the same as in M, and for every constant c, I \u2032(c, rr(n)) = I(c, r(n)), and I \u2032(P k, rr(n)) = I(P k, r(n)). The structure g(M) is a QIS that satisfies the following result:\nLemma 1. For every \u03c6 in Lm (resp. LCm),\n(M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c6 iff (g(M)\u03c3, rr, n) |= \u03c6\nProof. The proof is by induction on the structure of \u03c6. If \u03c6 is an atomic formula P k(t1, . . . , tk), then (M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c6 iff \u3008I\u03c3(t1), . . . , I\u03c3(tk)\u3009 \u2208 I(P k, r(n)), iff we have \u3008I \u2032\u03c3(t1), . . . , I \u2032\u03c3(tk)\u3009 \u2208 I \u2032(P k, rr(n)), iff (g(M)\u03c3, rr, n) |= \u03c6. The inductive cases for the propositional connectives and quantifiers are straightforward, as well as those for the temporal operators \u00a9 and U . As to \u03c6 = Ki\u03c8, we have that (M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c6 iff (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) implies (M\u03c3, r\u2032, n\u2032) |= \u03c8, but (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff rri (n) = rr \u2032 i (n\n\u2032). Thus, (M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c6 iff (rr, n) \u223c\u2032i (rr \u2032 , n\u2032) implies (M\u03c3, r\u2032, n\u2032) |= \u03c8. Again, by the induction hypothesis (M\u03c3, r, n) |= \u03c6 iff (rr, n) \u223c\u2032i (rr \u2032 , n\u2032) implies (g(M)\u03c3, rr\u2032 , n\u2032) |= \u03c8, i.e., iff (g(M)\u03c3, rr, n) |= \u03c6. The case for \u03c6 = C\u03c8 is treated similarly by considering the epistemic reachability relation.\nNotice that ifM satisfies synchronicity, or perfect recall, or no learning, or has a unique initial state, then also g(M) satisfies the same property. This follows from the fact that (r, n) \u223ci (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff (rri , n) \u223c\u2032i (rr \u2032 , n\u2032). Thus, g defines a map from each of the 16 subclasses of Km outlined in Def. 9 to the corresponding subclass of QISm and we obtain the following corollary to Lemma 1.\nCorollary 1. Let X be any subset of {pr, nl, sync, uis}. For every monodic formula \u03c6 \u2208 L1m (resp. LC1m), if \u03c6 is satisfiable in KXm, then \u03c6 is satisfiable in QISXm.\nFor reasoning about the monodic fragments of Lm and LCm when we are dealing with no learning and perfect recall, we introduce the following class of \u201cmonodic friendly\u201d Kripke models. These structures are motivated by the fact that KT1 and KT3 are too weak to enforce either perfect recall or no learning on Kripke models when these axioms are restricted to monodic formulas. However, they suffice for monodic friendly structures. In the following, we also prove that satisfiability in Kripke models is equivalent to satisfability in monodic friendly structures when we restrict our languages to monodic formulas.\nDefinition 11 (mf-model). A monodic friendly Kripke model is a tuple Mmf = \u3008W,RW , {\u223ci,a}i\u2208Ag,a\u2208D,D, I\u3009 such that\n\u2022 W , RW , D and I are defined as for Kripke models;\n\u2022 for i \u2208 Ag, a \u2208 D, \u223ci,a is an equivalence relation on W .\nWe can define synchronicity, perfect recall, no learning, and having a unique initial state also for mf-models by parametrising Def. 9 to each relation \u223ci,a. For instance, an mf-model satisfies perfect recall for agent i if for all points (r, n), (r\u2032, n\u2032), for all a \u2208 D, whenever (r, n) \u223ci,a (r\u2032, n\u2032) and n > 0 then either (r, n \u2212 1) \u223ci,a (r\u2032, n\u2032) or there is k < n\u2032 such that (r, n \u2212 1) \u223ci,a (r\u2032, k) and for all k\u2032, k < k\u2032 \u2264 n\u2032 implies (r, n) \u223ci,a (r\u2032, k\u2032). As regards the subclasses of the class MFm of all mf-models with m agents, we adopt the same naming conventions as for QIS and Kripke models. Notice that Kripke models can be seen as mf-models such that for all i \u2208 Ag, a, b \u2208 D, \u223ci,a is equal to \u223ci,b.\nFinally, the satisfaction relation |= for \u03c6 \u2208 L1m (resp. LC1m) in a mf-model Mmf is defined in the same way as in Kripke models, except for the epistemic operators:\n(M\u03c3mf , r, n) |= Ki\u03c8[y] iff for all r\u2032, n\u2032, (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c3(y) (r\u2032, n\u2032) implies (M\u03c3mf , r\u2032, n\u2032) |= \u03c8[y]\nwhere at most y appears free in \u03c8. Notice that if \u03c8 is a sentence, then (M\u03c3mf , r, n) |= Ki\u03c8 iff (r, n) \u223ci,a (r\u2032, n\u2032) implies (M\u03c3mf , r\u2032, n\u2032) |= \u03c8 for all a \u2208 D. The case for the common knowledge operator C is straightforward by definition of Ek. In particular, two points (r, n) and (r\u2032, n\u2032) are epistemically reachable for a \u2208 D, or simply reachable, if (r, n) \u223ca (r\u2032, n\u2032), where \u223ca is the transitive closure of \u22c3 i\u2208Ag \u223ci,a.\nWe remark that the converse of the Barcan formula, or CBF , Ki\u2200x\u03c8 \u2192 \u2200xKi\u03c8 holds in all mf-models; while the Barcan formula, or BF , \u2200xKi\u03c8 \u2192 Ki\u2200x\u03c8 does not. To check this consider the mf-model M = \u3008W,RW , {\u223ci,a}i\u2208Ag,a\u2208D,D, I\u3009 in Fig.1(a) such that\n- W = {w,w\u2032, w\u2032\u2032}\n- RW = {r, r\u2032, r\u2032\u2032} and r(0) = w, r\u2032(0) = w\u2032, and r\u2032\u2032(0) = w\u2032\u2032\n- D = {a, b}\n- I(P 1, r(0)) = {a, b}, I(P 1, r\u2032(0)) = {a} and I(P 1, r\u2032\u2032(0)) = {b}\n- \u223ci,a and \u223ci,b are equivalence relations such that (r, 0) \u223ci,a (r\u2032, 0) and (r, 0) \u223ci,b (r\u2032\u2032, 0).\nWe can see that (M, r, 0) |= \u2200xKiP (x), but (M, r, 0) 6|= Ki\u2200xP (x) as (r, 0) \u223ci,a (r\u2032, 0) and (M\u03c3, r\u2032, 0) 6|= P (x) for \u03c3(x) = b.\nFurthermore, the K axiom Ki(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8\u2032) \u2192 (Ki\u03c8 \u2192 Ki\u03c8\u2032) is not valid on mf-models either. In fact, consider the mf-model M\u2032 = \u3008W \u2032,R\u2032W \u2032 , {\u223c\u2032i,a}i\u2208Ag,a\u2208D\u2032 ,D\u2032, I \u2032\u3009 in Fig.1(b) such that\n- W \u2032 = {v, v\u2032, v\u2032\u2032}\n- R\u2032W \u2032 = {q, q\u2032, q\u2032\u2032} and q(0) = v, q\u2032(0) = v\u2032, and q\u2032\u2032(0) = v\u2032\u2032\n- D\u2032 = {c, d}\n- I \u2032(Q1, q(0)) = {c}, I \u2032(Q1, q\u2032(0)) = {c} and I \u2032(Q1, q\u2032\u2032(0)) = \u2205\n- \u223ci,c and \u223ci,d are equivalence relations such that (q, 0) \u223ci,c (q\u2032, 0) and (q, 0) \u223ci,d (q\u2032\u2032, 0).\nFinally, let \u03c3(x) = c. We can check that (M\u03c3, q, 0) |= (Q(x) \u2192 \u2203xQ(x)) \u2227 Q(x) and (M\u03c3, q\u2032, 0) |= (Q(x)\u2192 \u2203xQ(x))\u2227Q(x). Thus, (M\u03c3, q, 0) |= Ki(Q(x)\u2192 \u2203xQ(x))\u2227KiQ(x). But (M, q\u2032\u2032, 0) 6|= \u2203xQ(x), so (M\u03c3, q, 0) 6|= Ki\u2203xQ(x).\nWe now prove the following lemma, which will be used in the completeness proof for systems satisfying perfect recall or no learning. The lemma states that, when we deal with satisfability of monodic formulas, mf-models suffice.\nLemma 2. Let MFK,BFm be the class of all mf-models validating the formulas K and BF . For every monodic formula \u03c6 \u2208 L1m (resp. LC1m),\nKm |= \u03c6 iff MFK,BFm |= \u03c6\nProof. The implication from right to left follows from the fact that the class Km of all Kripke models is isomorphic to the subclass of monodic friendly Kripke models such that for all i \u2208 Ag, a, b \u2208 D, \u223ci,a is equal to \u223ci,b. In other words, given a Kripke model M = \u3008W,RW , {\u223ci}i\u2208Ag,D, I\u3009 we can define the mf-model M\u2032 = \u3008W,RW , {\u223ci,a}i\u2208Ag,a\u2208D,D, I\u3009, where for every a \u2208 D, \u223ci,a is equal to \u223ci. It is straightforward to see that M\u2032 validates both K and BF (in particular, the counterexamples in Fig. 1 are ruled out). Further, if M 6|= \u03c6 then M\u2032 6|= \u03c6. Thus, if MFK,BFm |= \u03c6, then Km |= \u03c6.\nFor the implication from left to right, assume that Mmf = \u3008W,RW , {\u223ci,a}i\u2208Ag,a\u2208D,D, I\u3009 is an mf-model validating K and BF such that (M\u03c3mf , r, n) 6|= \u03c6 for some point (r, n) and some assignment \u03c3. We can then build a Kripke model M\u2032 = \u3008W \u2032,R\u2032W \u2032 , {\u223c\u2032i}i\u2208Ag,D\u2032, I \u2032\u3009 from Mmf such that (M\u2032\u03c3, r, n) 6|= \u03c6 as follows. We start by assuming W \u2032 = W , R\u2032 = R and D\u2032 = D. Further, for each i \u2208 Ag, define \u223c\u2032i as the transitive closure of \u22c3 a\u2208D \u223ci,a. Finally, set I \u2032 = I. We now have to check that the Kripke model M\u2032 is well defined and does not validate \u03c6. First of all, we point out the following issue associated with the construction above: it\ncan be the case that for some point (q, k) and some monodic formula \u03c8[x], it happens that (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= Ki\u03c8[x], (q, k) \u223ci,\u03c3(x) (q\u2032, k\u2032) and (q, k) \u223ci,\u03c3(y) (q\u2032\u2032, k\u2032\u2032) for some \u03c3(x) 6= \u03c3(y). Further, suppose that (M\u03c3mf , q\u2032\u2032, k\u2032\u2032) 6|= \u03c8[x], while we obviously have that (M\u03c3mf , q\u2032, k\u2032) |= \u03c8[x]. Now by the definition of \u223c\u2032i we have that (M\u2032\u03c3, q, k) 6|= Ki\u03c8[x]; so the two models do not satisfy the same formulas. We can solve this problem by modifying the interpretation I according to the structure of the monodic formula \u03c8[x], while keeping the same truth value for \u03c8[x] at point (q, k). We consider the relevant cases according to the structure of \u03c8[x]; the induction hypothesis consists of the fact that we are able to find such an interpretation I for all subformulas of \u03c8[x].\nFor \u03c8[x] = P (x) we simply assume that \u03c3(x) \u2208 I(P, q\u2032\u2032(k\u2032\u2032)), so that (M\u2032\u03c3, q\u2032\u2032, k\u2032\u2032) |= \u03c8[x] and (M\u2032\u03c3, q, k) |= Ki\u03c8[x]. Note that this does not change the truth value of any epistemic formula in (q, k) as we assumed that (q, k) 6\u223ci,\u03c3(x) (q\u2032\u2032, k\u2032\u2032) (otherwise \u03c8[x] would be satisfied in (q\u2032\u2032, k\u2032\u2032)). The cases for propositional connectives and modal operators are similarly dealt with by applying the induction hypothesis. For \u03c8[x] = \u2200y\u03b8[x, y] we have that (M\u03c3mf , q\u2032\u2032, k\u2032\u2032) 6|= \u03c8[x], therefore there exists b \u2208 D such that (M \u03c3yb mf , q\n\u2032\u2032, k\u2032\u2032) 6|= \u03b8[x, y]. Now we have to consider 4 different cases depending on whether (q, k) satisfies any of these 4 formulas:\nKi \u2200x \u00ac\u03b8[x, y] (3) K\u0304i \u2200x \u00ac\u03b8[x, y] (4) Ki \u2203x \u00ac\u03b8[x, y] (5) K\u0304i \u2203x \u00ac\u03b8[x, y] (6)\nBy using the axioms and inference rules in QKTm for Formula (3) we can show what follows (where \u21d2 is used for entailment):\n(M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= Ki\u2200y\u03b8[x, y] \u2227Ki\u2200x\u00ac\u03b8[x, y]\u21d2 \u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= \u2203xKi\u2200y\u03b8[x, y] \u2227 \u2203yKi\u2200x\u00ac\u03b8[x, y] by Ex \u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= Ki\u2203x\u2200y\u03b8[x, y] \u2227Ki\u2203y\u2200x\u00ac\u03b8[x, y] by \u2203zKi\u03c6\u2192 Ki\u2203z\u03c6 \u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= Ki(\u2203x\u2200y\u03b8[x, y] \u2227 \u2203y\u2200x\u00ac\u03b8[x, y]) by Ki(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8)\u2194 Ki\u03c6 \u2227Ki\u03c8\n\u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= Ki(\u2203x\u2200u\u03b8[x, u] \u2227 \u2203y\u2200v\u00ac\u03b8[v, y]) by change of variables \u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= Ki\u2203x\u2203y\u2200u\u2200v(\u03b8[x, u] \u2227 \u00ac\u03b8[v, y]) by prefixing \u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= Ki\u2203x\u2203y(\u03b8[x, y] \u2227 \u00ac\u03b8[x, y]) by Ex\nbut the last formula is a contradiction; so (3) cannot hold in (q, k). Similarly, Formula (4) cannot hold in (q, k) either because:\n(M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= Ki\u2200y\u03b8[x, y] \u2227 K\u0304i\u2200x\u00ac\u03b8[x, y] \u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= \u2203xKi\u2200y\u03b8[x, y] \u2227 \u2203yK\u0304i\u2200x\u00ac\u03b8[x, y] by Ex \u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= Ki\u2203x\u2200y\u03b8[x, y] \u2227 \u2203yK\u0304i\u2200x\u00ac\u03b8[x, y] by \u2203zKi\u03c6\u2192 Ki\u2203z\u03c6 \u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= Ki\u2203x\u2200y\u03b8[x, y] \u2227 K\u0304i\u2203y\u2200x\u00ac\u03b8[x, y] by \u2203zK\u0304i\u03c6\u2194 K\u0304i\u2203z\u03c6 \u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= K\u0304i(\u2203x\u2200y\u03b8[x, y] \u2227 \u2203y\u2200x\u00ac\u03b8[x, y]) by Ki\u03c6 \u2227 K\u0304i\u03c8 \u2192 K\u0304i(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) \u21d2 (M\u03c3mf , q, k) |= K\u0304i\u2203x\u2203y(\u03b8[x, y] \u2227 \u00ac\u03b8[x, y]) similarly to above\nNote that in both derivations we make use of the formulas K and BF (for instance, to prove the theorems Ki(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2194 Ki\u03c6 \u2227Ki\u03c8 and \u2203zKi\u03c6 \u2192 Ki\u2203z\u03c6). Finally, to satify the Formulas (5) and (6) in (q, k), we have to guarantee the existence of an individual x while avoiding the clash with \u03c3(x). So, we introduce a new individual a\u2032 in the domain D\u2032 such that a\u2032 and \u03c3(x) satisfy the same formulas at all points. Thus, a\u2032 can be seen as a copy of \u03c3(x). Finally, by the induction hypothesis we can modify the interpretation I \u2032 so that (M\u2032\u03c3, q\u2032\u2032, k\u2032\u2032) |= \u03b8[x, y].\nThe case for the common knowledge operator derives from the one for Ki. As a result, we obtain a Kripke model M\u2032 such that (M\u2032\u03c3, r, n) 6|= \u03c6.\nMoreover, by the procedure described above, ifMmf satisfies perfect recall, or no learning, or synchronicity, or has unique initial state, then also M\u2032 satisfies the same property. Thus, by Lemma 2 we can prove the following result.\nCorollary 2. Let X be any subset of {pr, nl, sync, uis}. For every monodic formula \u03c6 \u2208 L1m (resp. LC1m), if \u03c6 is satisfiable in MFXm also validating the formulas K and BF , then \u03c6 is satisfiable in KXm.\nProof. It is easy to see that if Mmf satisfies either synchronicity or has a unique initial state, then M\u2032 does as well by the way it is defined. Further, suppose that Mmf satisfies perfect recall, and (r, n) \u223c\u2032i (r\u2032, n\u2032) for n > 0. This means that there is a sequence a1, . . . , ak of individuals in D and a sequence (q1,m1), . . . , (qk,mk) of points such that (i) (r, n) = (q1,m1) and (r\u2032, n\u2032) = (qk,mk); and (ii) (qj ,mj) \u223ci,aj (qj+1,mj+1) for j < k. We show the result for k = 3, the case for k > 3 follows by a straightforward generalisation.\nIf (q1,m1 \u2212 1) \u223ci,a1 (q2,m2), then by the definition of \u223c\u2032i we have that (q1,m1 \u2212 1) \u223c\u2032i (q3,m3) as well. Hence, Mmf satisfies perfect recall. Otherwise, suppose that by perfect recall there is l2 < m2 such that (q1,m1 \u2212 1) \u223ci,a1 (q2, l2), and for all l\u20322, l2 < l\u20322 \u2264 m2 implies (q1,m1) \u223ci,a1 (q2, l\u20322). Now consider each l\u20322(h) = m2 \u2212 h, for 0 \u2264 h < m2 \u2212 l2. By perfect recall, either (i) there exists p3(h) such that (q2, l\u20322(h)) \u223ci,a2 (q3, p3(h)), and for all p\u20323(h), p3(h) < p \u2032 3(h) \u2264 p3(h \u2212 1) implies (q2, l2(h)) \u223ci,a2 (q3, p\u20323(h)), or (ii) (q2, l\u20322(h) \u2212 1) \u223ci,a2 (q3, p3(h \u2212 1)), where p3(\u22121) = m3. Notice that in both cases, by the definition of \u223c\u2032i, we have that (q1,m1) \u223c\u2032i (q3, p\u20323(h)) for all 0 \u2264 h < m2 \u2212 l2, that is, (q1,m1) \u223c\u2032i (q3, p\u20323) for all p3[l2 +1] < p\u20323 \u2264 m3. Further, for l2, either (i) there exists l3 such\nthat (q2, l2 \u2212 1) \u223ci,a2 (q3, l3), and for all l\u20323, l3 < l\u20323 \u2264 p3[l2 + 1] implies (q2, l2) \u223ci,a2 (q3, l\u20323), or (ii) (q2, l2 \u2212 1) \u223ci,a2 (q3, p3[l2 + 1]). In the first case, if some l\u20323 is strictly less than m3, then there is l\u20323 such that (q1,m1 \u2212 1) \u223c\u2032i (q3, l\u20323) and for all l\u2032\u20323 , l\u20323 < l\u2032\u20323 \u2264 m3 implies (q1,m1) \u223c\u2032i (q3, l\u2032\u20323). Otherwise, we have that (q1,m1\u2212 1) \u223c\u2032i (q3,m3). Hence,Mmf satisfies perfect recall.\nThe proof for no learning is similar.\nFinally, by combining Corollaries 1 and 2 we immediately obtain the following result.\nCorollary 3. Let X be any subset of {pr, nl, sync, uis}. For every monodic formula \u03c6 \u2208 L1m (resp. LC1m), if \u03c6 is satisfiable in MFXm also validating the formulas K and BF , then \u03c6 is satisfiable in QISXm.\nIn the next section we show that it is indeed possible to build such an mf-model."}, {"heading": "4. The Completeness Proof", "text": "In this section we outline the main steps of the completeness proof, which is based on a quasimodel construction (Gabbay, Kurucz, Wolter, & Zakharyaschev, 2003; Hodkinson et al., 2000). Differently from these contributions, here we explicitly take into account the interaction between temporal and epistemic modalities. Intuitively, a quasimodel for a monodic formula \u03c6 is a relational structure whose points are sets of sets of subformulas of \u03c6. Each set of sets of subformulas describes a \u201cpossible state of affairs\u201d, and contains sets of subformulas defining the individuals in that state. More formally, given a formula \u03c6 \u2208 LC1n we define\nsubC\u03c6 = sub\u03c6 \u222a {EC\u03c8 | C\u03c8 \u2208 sub\u03c6} \u222a {KiC\u03c8 | C\u03c8 \u2208 sub\u03c6, i \u2208 Ag}\nwhere sub\u03c6 is the set of subformulas of \u03c6. For \u03c6 \u2208 L1n, subC\u03c6 is simply sub\u03c6. Further, we define\nsubC\u00a9\u00ac\u03c6 = subC\u03c6 \u222a {\u00ac\u03c8 | \u03c8 \u2208 subC\u03c6} \u222a {\u00a9\u03c8 | \u03c8 \u2208 subC\u03c6} \u222a {\u00a9\u00ac\u03c8 | \u03c8 \u2208 subC\u03c6}\nObserve that subC\u00a9\u00ac\u03c6 is closed under negation modulo equivalences \u03c6\u2194 \u00ac\u00ac\u03c6 and T1, that is, for all \u03c8 \u2208 subC\u00a9\u00ac\u03c6, if \u03c8 is not of the form \u00ac\u03b8 then \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 subC\u00a9\u00ac\u03c6; otherwise, \u03b8 \u2208 subC\u00a9\u00ac\u03c6. Finally, let subn\u03c6 be the subset of subC\u00a9\u00ac\u03c6 containing formulas with at most n free variables. So, sub0\u03c6 is the set of sentences in subn\u03c6. If x is a variable not occurring in \u03c6, we define subx\u03c6 = {\u03c8[y/x] | \u03c8[y] \u2208 sub1\u03c6}. Clearly, x is the only free variable in the formulas in subx\u03c6. By con\u03c6 we denote the set of all constants occurring in \u03c6. In Table 3 we report the set suby\u03c6 for \u03c6 equal to Formula (1) thus abbreviated:\n\u2200y C(\u2200zAv(y, z)U\u2203xReq(x, y))\nFurther, for k \u2208 N we define the closures clk\u03c6 and clk,i\u03c6 by mutual recursion.\nDefinition 12. Let cl0\u03c6 = subx\u03c6 and for k \u2265 0, clk+1\u03c6 = \u22c3 i\u2208Ag clk,i\u03c6. For k \u2265 0, i \u2208 Ag, clk,i\u03c6 = clk\u03c6 \u222a {Ki(\u03c81 \u2228 . . . \u2228 \u03c8n),\u00acKi(\u03c81 \u2228 . . . \u2228 \u03c8n) | \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8n \u2208 clk\u03c6}.\nWe define ad(\u03c6) as the greatest number of alternations of distinct Ki\u2019s along any branch in \u03c6\u2019s parse tree (Halpern et al., 2004). Further, an index is any finite sequence \u03b9 = i1, . . . , ik of agents such that in 6= in+1, for 1 \u2264 n < k; the length of \u03b9 is denoted by |\u03b9|. Also, \u03b9]i is the absorptive concatenation of indexes \u03b9 and i such that \u03b9]i = \u03b9 if ik = i. Finally, K\u03b9\u03c8 is a shorthand for Ki1 . . .Kik\u03c8. Now let \u03b9 be an index such that |\u03b9| \u2264 ad(\u03c6). If \u03b9 is the empty sequence then cl\u03b9\u03c6 = clad(\u03c6)\u03c6. If \u03b9 = \u03b9\u2032]i, then cl\u03b9\u03c6 = clk,i\u03c6 for k = ad(\u03c6) \u2212 |\u03b9|. We now introduce types for quasimodels, which intuitively can be seen as individuals described by maximal and consistent sets of formulas.\nDefinition 13 (Type). A \u03b9-type t for \u03c6 is any maximal and consistent subset of cl\u03b9\u03c6, i.e., for every monodic formulas \u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 in cl\u03b9\u03c6,\n(i) \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 t iff \u03c8 /\u2208 t;\n(ii) \u03c8 \u2227 \u03c8\u2032 \u2208 t iff \u03c8, \u03c8\u2032 \u2208 t.\nTwo \u03b9-types t, t\u2032 are said to agree on sub0\u03c6 if t \u2229 sub0\u03c6 = t\u2032 \u2229 sub0\u03c6, i.e., if they share the same sentences. Given a \u03b9-type t for \u03c6 and a constant c \u2208 con\u03c6, \u3008t, c\u3009 is an indexed type for \u03c6, abbreviated as tc. In Table 4 we report a type t in cl0\u03c6, for \u03c6 equal to Formula (1).\nWe now introduce state candidates, which intuitively represent the states of a quasimodel.\nDefinition 14 (State candidate). A \u03b9-state candidate for \u03c6 is a pair C = \u3008T, T con\u3009 such that\n(i) T is a set of \u03b9-types for \u03c6 that agree on sub0\u03c6;\n(ii) T con is a set containing for each c \u2208 con\u03c6 an indexed type tc such that t \u2208 T .\nWe also introduce the notion of point, which describes a state candidate from the perspective of a particular type.\nDefinition 15 (Point). A \u03b9-point for \u03c6 is a pair P = \u3008C, t\u3009 such that\n(i) C = \u3008T, T con\u3009 is a \u03b9-state candidate for \u03c6;\n(ii) t \u2208 T is a \u03b9-type.\nNote that, by a slight abuse of notation, we call points both the pairs (r, n) in QIS and the pairs P = \u3008C, t\u3009. This is to be consistent with previous work (Fagin et al., 1995; Halpern et al., 2004); the context will disambiguate. Also, we write t \u2208 C for C = \u3008T, T con\u3009 and t \u2208 T . Similarly for t \u2208 P. Given a \u03b9-state candidate C = \u3008T, T con\u3009 and a point P = \u3008C, t\u3009 we define the formulas \u03b1C and \u03b2P as follows:\n\u03b1C := \u2227 t\u2208T \u2203xt[x] \u2227 \u2200x \u2228 t\u2208T t[x] \u2227 \u2227 tc\u2208T con t[x/c] \u03b2P := \u03b1C \u2227 t\nwhere we do not distinguish between a type t and the conjuction of formulas it contains. A \u03b9-state candidate C is S-consistent if the formula \u03b1C is consistent w.r.t. the system S, i.e., if 0S \u00ac\u03b1C. Similarly, a \u03b9-point P is S-consistent if the formula \u03b2P is consistent w.r.t. S. We refer to plain consistency whenever the system S of reference is understood. Consistent state candidates represent the states of our quasimodels. We now define the relations of suitability that constitute the relational part of quasimodels.\nDefinition 16. \u2022 A \u03b91-type t1 and a \u03b92-type t2 are \u00a9-suitable, or t1 \u21d2 t2, iff \u03b91 = \u03b92 and t1\u2227\u00a9t2 is consistent. They are i-suitable, or t1 \u2248i t2, iff \u03b91]i = \u03b92]i and t1\u2227K\u0304it2 is consistent.\n\u2022 A \u03b91-state candidate C1 and a \u03b92-state candidate C2 are \u00a9-suitable, or C1 \u21d2 C2, iff \u03b91 = \u03b92 and \u03b1C1 \u2227\u00a9\u03b1C2 is consistent. They are i-suitable, or C1 \u2248i C2, iff \u03b91]i = \u03b92]i and \u03b1C1 \u2227 K\u0304i\u03b1C2 is consistent.\n\u2022 A \u03b91-point P1 and a \u03b92-point P2 are \u00a9-suitable, or P1 \u21d2 P2, iff \u03b91 = \u03b92 and \u03b2P1 \u2227 \u00a9\u03b2P2 is consistent. They are i-suitable, or P1 \u2248i P2, iff \u03b91]i = \u03b92]i and \u03b2P1 \u2227 K\u0304i\u03b2P2 is consistent.\n\u2022 A \u03b91-point P1 = \u3008C1, t1\u3009 and a \u03b92-point P2 = \u3008C2, t2\u3009 are \u00a9-suitable for a constant c \u2208 con\u03c6, or P1 \u21d2c P2, iff P1 \u21d2 P2, tc1 \u2208 T con1 and tc2 \u2208 T con2 . They are i-suitable for c, or P1 \u2248ci P2, iff P1 \u2248i P2, tc1 \u2208 T con1 and tc2 \u2208 T con2 .\nBy using the axioms T , 4 and 5 it can be shown that the relation \u2248i is reflexive, transitive and symmetric, that is, an equivalence relation. Also, the relation \u21d2 is serial. In the following lemma we list some properties of relations \u21d2 and \u2248i that will be useful in what follows.\nLemma 3. (i) Let \u00a9\u03c8 \u2208 subx\u03c6, if t1 \u21d2 t2 then \u00a9\u03c8 \u2208 t1 iff \u03c8 \u2208 t2.\n(ii) Let Ki\u03c8 \u2208 subx\u03c6 and let t be a \u03b9-type, Ki\u03c8 \u2208 t iff for all \u03b9-types t\u2032, t \u2248i t\u2032 implies \u03c8 \u2208 t\u2032. Moreover, let |\u03b9]i| \u2264 ad(\u03c6), then Ki\u03c8 \u2208 t iff for all \u03b9]i-types t\u2032, t \u2248i t\u2032 implies \u03c8 \u2208 t\u2032.\nProof.\n(i) The proof is similar to the one for Lemma 9(i) in the work of Wolter et al. (2002). If \u00a9\u03c8 \u2208 t1 and \u03c8 /\u2208 t2 then \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 t2 and since t1\u2227\u00a9t2 is consistent, then also\u00a9\u03c8\u2227\u00a9\u00ac\u03c8 is consistent, which is a contradiction. From right to left, if \u03c8 \u2208 t2 and \u00a9\u03c8 /\u2208 t1 then \u00ac\u00a9 \u03c8 \u2208 t1. Since t1 \u2227\u00a9t2 is consistent, then also \u00ac\u00a9 \u03c8 \u2227\u00a9\u03c8 is consistent, which is a contradiction.\n(ii) From left to right, if Ki\u03c8 \u2208 t and \u03c8 /\u2208 t\u2032 then \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 t\u2032 and since t \u2227 K\u0304it\u2032 is consistent, then also Ki\u03c8 \u2227 K\u0304i\u00ac\u03c8 is consistent, which is a contradiction. From right to left, if Ki\u03c8 /\u2208 t then we can extend the set {\u00ac\u03c8} \u222a {\u03b8 | Ki\u03b8 \u2208 t} to a \u03b9-type t\u2032. In particular, t \u2248i t\u2032 and \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 t\u2032. Moreover, if |\u03b9]i| \u2264 ad(\u03c6) then we can similarly prove that Ki\u03c8 \u2208 t iff for all \u03b9]i-types t\u2032, t \u2248i t\u2032 implies \u03c8 \u2208 t\u2032.\nWe now present the frame underlying the quasimodel for \u03c6.\nDefinition 17 (Frame). A frame F is a tuple \u3008R,D, {\u223ci,a}i\u2208Ag,a\u2208D, f\u3009 where\n(i) R is a non-empty set of indexes r, r\u2032, . . .;\n(ii) D is a non-empty set of individuals;\n(iii) for every i \u2208 Ag, a \u2208 D, \u223ci,a is an equivalence relation on the set of points (r, n) for r \u2208 R and n \u2208 N;\n(iv) f is a partial function associating to each point (r, n) a consistent state candidate f(r, n) = Cr,n such that\n(a) the domain of f is not empty;\n(b) if f is defined on (r, n), then it is defined on (r, n+ 1);\n(c) if f is defined on (r, n) and (r, n) \u223ci,a (r\u2032, n\u2032), then f is defined on (r\u2032, n\u2032).\nThe function f is partial to take into consideration the case of synchronous systems. Also, it is straightforward to introduce frames satisfying perfect recall, no learning, synchronicity, or having a unique initial state, by following the same definitions given for mf-models. Next, we provide the definition of objects, which correspond to the runs of Gabbay et al. (2003). We choose this terminology to avoid confusion with the runs in QIS.\nDefinition 18 (Object). Given an individual a \u2208 D, an object in the frame F is a map \u03c1a associating a type \u03c1a(r, n) \u2208 Tr,n to every (r, n) \u2208 Dom(f) with f(r, n) = Cr,n = \u3008Tr,n, T conr,n \u3009 such that\n1. \u03c1a(r, n)\u21d2 \u03c1a(r, n+ 1)\n2. if (r, n) \u223ci,a (r\u2032, n\u2032) then \u03c1a(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1a(r\u2032, n\u2032)\n3. \u03c7U\u03c8 \u2208 \u03c1a(r, n) iff there is n\u2032 \u2265 n such that \u03c8 \u2208 \u03c1a(r, n\u2032) and for all n\u2032\u2032, n \u2264 n\u2032\u2032 < n\u2032 implies \u03c7 \u2208 \u03c1a(r, n\u2032\u2032)\n4. if \u03c1a(r, n) \u2248i t are \u03b9-types, then for some (r\u2032, n\u2032), (r, n) \u223ci,a (r\u2032, n\u2032) and \u03c1a(r\u2032, n\u2032) = t\n5. if \u00acC\u03c8 \u2208 \u03c1a(r, n) then there exists a point (r\u2032, n\u2032) reachable from (r, n) such that \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 \u03c1a(r\u2032, n\u2032)\nAn object+ satisfies (1), (2), (3), (5) above and (4\u2032) below instead of (4).\n(4\u2032) if \u03c1a(r, n) is a \u03b9-type, t is a \u03b9]i-type and \u03c1a(r, n) \u2248i t, then for some (r\u2032, n\u2032) \u223ci,a (r, n), \u03c1a(r\u2032, n\u2032) = t.\nIntuitively, an object identifies the same individual, here represented by types, across different state candidates. Now we have all the elements to give the definition of quasimodel.\nDefinition 19 (Quasimodel). A quasimodel for \u03c6 is a tuple Q = \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 such that \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a frame, and\n1. \u03c6 \u2208 t for some t \u2208 Tr,n and Tr,n \u2208 Cr,n\n2. Cr,n \u21d2 Cr,n+1\n3. if (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) then \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032)\n4. for every t \u2208 Tr,n there exists an object \u03c1 \u2208 O such that \u03c1(r, n) = t\n5. for every c \u2208 con\u03c6, the function \u03c1c such that \u03c1c(r, n) = tc \u2208 T conr,n is an object in O.\nA quasimodel+ is defined as a quasimodel but where clauses (4) and (5) refer to objects+ rather than objects. We can define quasimodels (resp. quasimodel+) satisfying perfect recall, no learning, synchronicity, or having a unique initial state, by assuming the corresponding condition on the underlying frame. The difference between objects (resp. quasimodel) and objects+ (resp. quasimodel+) is purely technical. In particular, the latter are needed for systems satisfying perfect recall and no learning as it will become apparent in Section 5. In the following lemma we list some properties of quasimodels that will be useful in what follows.\nLemma 4. In every quasimodel Q, for every object \u03c1 \u2208 O,\n(i) Ki\u03c7 \u2208 \u03c1(r, n) iff for all (r\u2032, n\u2032), (r\u2032, n\u2032) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r, n) implies \u03c7 \u2208 \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032).\n(ii) C\u03c7 \u2208 \u03c1(r, n) iff for all points (r\u2032, n\u2032) reachable from (r, n) we have that \u03c7 \u2208 \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032).\nProof.\n(i) The implication from left to right follows from the fact that (r\u2032, n\u2032) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r, n) implies \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032). For the implication from right to left, if Ki\u03c7 /\u2208 \u03c1(r, n) then by Lemma 3(ii) there is a \u03b9-type t such that \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i t and \u00ac\u03c7 \u2208 t. By Definition 18 for some (r\u2032, n\u2032), (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) and \u00ac\u03c7 \u2208 \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) = t.\n(ii) The implication from left to right is proved by induction on the length of the path from (r, n) to (r\u2032, n\u2032). Both the base case and the inductive step follow by axiom C1. The implication from right to left follows from Definition 18.\nWe now state the main result of this section, that is, satisfability in quasimodels implies satisfability in mf-models. In what follows a quasimodel Q validates a formula \u03c6 if \u03c6 belongs to every type in every state-candidate in Q.\nTheorem 3. If there is a quasimodel (resp. quasimodel+) Q for a monodic formula \u03c6, then \u03c6 is satisfiable in a mf-modelMmf . Moreover, if Q validates the formulas K and BF , then so does Mmf . Finally, if Q satisfies perfect recall, or no learning, or synchronicity, or has a unique initial state, then so does Mmf .\nProof. This proof is inspired by those of Lemmas 11.72 and 12.9 in the work of Gabbay et al. (2003), but here we consider monodic friendly Kripke models rather than standard Kripke models. First, for every monodic formula \u03c8 of the form Ki\u03c7, C\u03c7, \u00a9\u03c7 or \u03c71U\u03c72 we introduce a k-ary predicate constant P k\u03c8 for k equal to 0 or 1, depending whether there are 0 or 1 free variables in \u03c8. The formula P k\u03c8(x) is called the surrogate of \u03c8. Given a monodic formula \u03c6 we denote by \u03c6 the formula obtained from \u03c6 by substituting all its modal subformulas which are not within the scope of another modal operator with their surrogates. Since every state candidate C in the quasimodel Q is consistent and all the system S of first-order temporal-epistemic logic considered in Section 3 are based on classical first-order logic, the formula \u03b1C is consistent with respect to first-order (non-modal) logic. By Go\u0308del\u2019s completeness theorem there is a first-order structure I = \u3008I,D\u3009, where D is a non-empty set of individuals and I is a first-order interpretation on D, that satisfies \u03b1C, i.e., I\u03c3 |= \u03b1C for some assignment \u03c3 of the variables to the elements in D. We intend to build an mf-model by joining all these first-order structures. However, it is possible that these structures have different domains with different cardinalities. To solve this problem, we consider a cardinal number \u03ba \u2265 \u21350 greater than the cardinality of the set O of all objects in Q and define\nD = {\u3008\u03c1, \u03be\u3009 | \u03c1 \u2208 O, \u03be < \u03ba}\nThen, for (r, n) \u2208 Q, for any \u03b9-type t \u2208 Tr,n we have that\n|{\u3008\u03c1, \u03be\u3009 \u2208 D | \u03c1(r, n) = t}| = \u03ba\nBy the method described in Claim 11.24 by Gabbay et al. (2003), we can expand each first-order structure to obtain a structure Ir,n = \u3008Ir,n,D\u3009 with domain D such that Ir,n satisfies \u03b1Cr,n and\n|{a \u2208 D | \u03c3(x) = a and I\u03c3r,n |= t[x]}| = \u03ba\nSo, we can assume without loss of generality that all first-order structures Ir,n share the same domain D, and for every t \u2208 Tr,n, \u3008\u03c1, \u03be\u3009 \u2208 D, we have\n\u03c1(r, n) = t iff I\u03c3r,n |= t[x]\nfor \u03c3(x) = \u3008\u03c1, \u03be\u3009. Equivalently, for t \u2208 Tr,n, \u03c3(x) = \u3008\u03c1, \u03be\u3009 \u2208 D,\n\u03c1(r, n) = {\u03c8 \u2208 cl\u03b9\u03c6 | I\u03c3r,n |= \u03c8[x]} (7)\nMoreover, Ir,n(c) = \u3008\u03c1c, 0\u3009 for every c \u2208 con\u03c6. We define the mf-model Mmf as the tuple \u3008W,R, {\u223ci,a}i\u2208Ag,a\u2208D,D, I\u3009 such that W is the set of points (r, n) for r in R \u2208 Q and n \u2208 N; R is the set of runs from N to W such that r(n) = (r, n); D is defined as above; for i \u2208 Ag and \u3008\u03c1, \u03be\u3009 \u2208 D, \u223ci,\u3008\u03c1,\u03be\u3009 is defined as \u223ci,\u03c1; and the interpretation I is obtained by joining the various first-order interpretations Ir,n, i.e., I(P, r(n)) = Ir,n(P ) for every predicate constant P . We can now prove the following result for Mmf .\nLemma 5. If the mf-model Mmf is obtained from a quasimodel Q as described above, then for every \u03c8 \u2208 subx\u03c6,\nI\u03c3r,n |= \u03c8 iff (M\u03c3mf , r, n) |= \u03c8\nMoreover, if Q is a quasimodel+, f(r, n) is a \u03b9-state candidate and ad(K\u03b9\u03c8) \u2264 ad(\u03c6) then\nI\u03c3r,n |= \u03c8 iff (M\u03c3mf , r, n) |= \u03c8\nProof. The proof is similar to Lemma 12.10 in the work of Gabbay et al. (2003). We begin with the first part. The base case of induction follows by definition of the interpretation I in the mf-model.

Step (21) is motivated by Lemma 4(ii), and step (23) follows by the induction hypothesis.\nNow we prove the second part of the lemma. All cases are identical to the first part, except for \u03c8 = Ki\u03c7. Suppose that f(r, n) is a \u03b9-state candidate and ad(K\u03b9\u03c8) \u2264 ad(\u03c6). For the implication from left to right, if (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) then \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) is a \u03b9\u2032-type such that \u03b9]i = \u03b9\u2032]i. Thus, ad(K\u03b9\u2032\u03c7) \u2264 ad(K\u03b9]i\u03c7) \u2264 ad(K\u03b9Ki\u03c7) \u2264 ad(\u03c6). So, we can apply the induction hypothesis. For the implication from right to left, if ad(K\u03b9Ki\u03c7) \u2264 ad(\u03c6) then |\u03b9]i| \u2264 ad(\u03c6) and by Lemma 3(ii) there is some \u03b9]i-type t such that t \u2248i \u03c1(r, n) and \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 t. By Def. 18 there is (r\u2032, n\u2032) such that (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) and \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) = t. Since ad(K\u03b9]i\u03c7) = ad(K\u03b9Ki\u03c7) \u2264 ad(\u03c6) we can apply the induction hypothesis.\nTo complete the proof of Theorem 3, by definition of quasimodel we have that \u03c6 \u2208 t for some t \u2208 Tr,n and Tr,n \u2208 Cr,n. Therefore, \u03c6 is satisfied in the mf-modelMmf at point (r, n). We also remark that if Q validates the formulas K and BF , so doesMmf . This is the case as, if K and BF belong to every type in every state-candidate in Q, then by Lemma 5 we have that Mmf validates K and BF as well.\nFinally, if Q satisfies perfect recall, or no learning, or synchronicity, or has a unique initial state, then the mf-model obtained from Q satisfies the corresponding constraints by construction. We show this fact for perfect recall: if (r, n) \u223ci,\u3008\u03c1,\u03be\u3009 (r\u2032, n\u2032) and n > 0, then in particular (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032). Since Q satisfies perfect recall, either (r, n\u2212 1) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032), or there is k < n\u2032 such that (r, n \u2212 1) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, k) and for all k\u2032, k < k\u2032 \u2264 n\u2032 implies (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, k\u2032). By the definition of \u223ci,\u3008\u03c1,\u03be\u3009 we obtain that either (r, n\u22121) \u223ci,\u3008\u03c1,\u03be\u3009 (r\u2032, n\u2032), or there is k < n\u2032 such that (r, n \u2212 1) \u223ci,\u3008\u03c1,\u03be\u3009 (r\u2032, k) and for all k\u2032, k < k\u2032 \u2264 n\u2032 implies (r, n) \u223ci,\u3008\u03c1,\u03be\u3009 (r\u2032, k\u2032), that is, Mmf satisfies perfect recall as well.\nWe next show the existence of quasimodels for any monodic \u03c6."}, {"heading": "5.

The proof is similar to the one for Claims 11.75, 11.76 and 12.13 in the work of Gabbay et al. (2003), but here we consider \u03b9-state candidates and \u03b9-points. Let \u03c0\u03c6 be the disjunction of all formulas \u03b2P for all \u03b9-points P for \u03c6. Consider the formula \u03c0\u03c6, which is obtained by substituting all subformulas of \u03c0\u03c6 of the form Ki\u03c8, C\u03c8, \u00a9\u03c8 or \u03c81U\u03c82 that are not within the scope of another modal operator with their surrogates. We can check that \u03c0\u03c6 is true on all (non-modal) first-order structures. Since both QKTm and QKTCm extend first-order logic, by the semantical completeness of first-order logic we have that\n` \u03c0\u03c6 (24)\n(i) Notice that, by the previous remark, ` \u03c0\u03c6 also for \u03c0\u03c6 = \u2228 {P|P is a -point for \u03c6} \u03b2P.\nMoreover, \u03c6 is consistent and by (24) also \u03c0\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c6 is consistent.

Suppose that t and t\u2032 are \u03b9-types such that t \u21d2 t\u2032, then there are \u03b9-points P = \u3008C, t\u3009 and P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 such that P \u21d2 P\u2032. In particular, for any c \u2208 con\u03c6, there are \u03b9-points P = \u3008C, t\u3009 and P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 such that P\u21d2c P\u2032.\nProof. By Lemma 6 we have that ` \u03c0\u03c6 and ` \u00a9\u03c0\u03c6 for \u03c0\u03c6 = \u2228 {P|P is a \u03b9-point for \u03c6} \u03b2P. Since t \u21d2 t\u2032, then \u03c0\u03c6 \u2227 t \u2227 \u00a9(\u03c0\u03c6 \u2227 t\u2032) is consistent. Thus, there must be \u03b9-points P and P\u2032 such that \u03b2P \u2227 t \u2227 \u00a9(\u03b2P\u2032 \u2227 t\u2032) is consistent. Then, it is the case that P = \u3008C, t\u3009 and P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 for some \u03b9-state candidates C and C\u2032. As a result, P\u21d2 P\u2032. The second part of the lemma is proved similarly to the first by observing that if t \u21d2 t\u2032 then t[x/c] \u2227\u00a9t[x/c] is consistent. Hence, also \u03c0\u03c6 \u2227 t[x/c] \u2227\u00a9(\u03c0\u03c6 \u2227 t\u2032[x/c]) is consistent. Thus, there must be \u03b9-points P and P\u2032 such that \u03b2P \u2227 t[x/c] \u2227\u00a9(\u03b2P\u2032 \u2227 t\u2032[x/c]) is consistent.

Every finite \u21d2-sequence of \u03b9-state candidates can be extended to an infinite acceptable \u21d2-sequence.\nProof. Assume that C0 \u21d2 . . .\u21d2 Cn is a finite \u21d2-sequence \u03a3 and \u03c81U\u03c82 \u2208 tk \u2208 Ck for some k \u2264 n. Either \u03c81U\u03c82 is realised in C0 \u21d2 . . .\u21d2 Cn, or by Lemma 6(ii)(c) we can extend \u03a3 to a \u21d2-sequence \u03a3\u2032 that realises \u03c81U\u03c82. This procedure is repeated for all formulas of the form \u03c81U\u03c82 appearing at some point in the \u21d2-sequence. Thus, we obtain a (possibly infinite) \u21d2-sequence C0 \u21d2 C1 \u21d2 . . . such that property (i) in Definition 20 is satisfied. To also satisfy property (ii) we reason similarly by using Lemma 6(ii)(d) instead.\nNow let X be a new object, a sequence X, . . . ,X,Cn,Cn+1, . . . is acceptable from n if it starts with n copies of X and Cn,Cn+1, . . . is an acceptable \u21d2-sequence. We can now consider the completeness proof for each single class of QIS.\n5.1 The Classes QISm, QISsyncm , QISuism and QISsync,uism We start with the completeness proof for the systems QKTm and QKTCm, where there is no interaction between temporal and epistemic operators.\nIf a monodic formula \u03c6 is consistent, then by Lemma 6(i) there is a consistent -state candidate C = \u3008T, T con\u3009 such that \u03c6 \u2208 t for some type t \u2208 T . Also, by Lemma 8 we can extend C to an infinite acceptable \u21d2-sequence. So, the set of infinite acceptable \u21d2- sequences is non-empty. Let R be the set of all \u21d2-sequences acceptable from n, for some n \u2208 N. For r \u2208 R, k \u2208 N, define the partial function f on R \u00d7 N as f(r, k) = Ck if r is the \u21d2-sequence X, . . . ,X,Cn,Cn+1, . . . acceptable from n and k \u2265 n, undefined otherwise. Finally, let O be the set of all functions \u03c1 associating every (r, n) \u2208 Dom(f) to a type \u03c1(r, n) \u2208 Tr,n such that\n(A) \u03c1(r, n)\u21d2 \u03c1(r, n+ 1);\n(B) \u03c7U\u03c8 \u2208 \u03c1(r, n) iff there is n\u2032 \u2265 n such that \u03c8 \u2208 \u03c1(r, n\u2032) and \u03c7 \u2208 \u03c1(r, n\u2032\u2032) for all n \u2264 n\u2032\u2032 < n\u2032;\n(C) if \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i t are \u03b9-types, then for some (r\u2032, n), \u03c1(r\u2032, n) = t;\n(D) if \u00acC\u03c8 \u2208 \u03c1(r, n) then there exists a point (r\u2032, n) and a sequence of \u03b9-points Pj = \u3008Cj , tj\u3009 for j \u2264 k, such that \u3008f(r, n), \u03c1(r, n)\u3009 = P0 \u2248i0 . . . \u2248ik\u22121 Pk, \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 tk, f(r\u2032, n) = Ck and \u03c1(r\u2032, n) = tk.\nWe show that O is non-empty. Condition (A) is guaranteed by Lemma 6(ii)(a), and condition (B) by the fact that r is an acceptable \u21d2-sequence. As regards (C) we remark that if \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i t then we can find a consistent \u03b9-point P = \u3008C, t\u3009 by reasoning similarly as in Lemma 6(i), and by Lemma 8, C can be extended to a \u21d2-sequence r\u2032 acceptable from n. Finally, set \u03c1(r\u2032, n) = t. As to (D) we observe that if \u00acC\u03c8 \u2208 \u03c1(r, n) then by Lemma 6(ii)(g) there exists a sequence of \u03b9-points Pj = \u3008Cj , tj\u3009 for j \u2264 k, such that \u3008f(r, n), \u03c1(r, n)\u3009 = P0 \u2248i0 . . . \u2248ik\u22121 Pk and \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 tk. Now, Ck can be extended to a \u21d2- sequence r\u2032 acceptable from n such that \u03c1(r\u2032, n) = tk. Finally, for i \u2208 Ag, \u03c1 \u2208 O, define (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) and n = n\u2032.\nLemma 9. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a synchronous frame.\nProof. We have previously shown that R and O are non-empty. Also, each \u223ci,\u03c1 is an equivalence relation by definition, and f satisfies the conditions in Definition 17. Further, the frame is synchronous by definition of \u223ci,\u03c1.\nNow we can prove the main result.\nLemma 10. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a synchronous quasimodel for \u03c6 and it validates the formulas K and BF .\nProof. By the previous lemma, it remains to prove that the functions in O are objects. Conditions (1), (3), (4) and (5) on objects are safisfied by remarks (A)-(D) above. Condition (2) is satisfied by the definition of \u223ci,\u03c1. Furthermore, conditions (1), (2) and (3) on quasimodels are satisfied by the definitions of R, f and \u223ci,\u03c1. As regards (4), we can extend the function \u03c1(r, n) = t to all Dom(f) by using Lemma 6(ii)(a), (c), (e) and (g). As to (5) the function \u03c1c such that \u03c1c(r, n) = tc is an object by Lemma 6(ii)(b), (d), (f) and (h). Finally, Q validates both the formulas K and BF , as all t \u2208 C, for all C \u2208 Q, are consistent with QKTm (resp. QKTCm).\nThe completeness of QKTm and QKTCm with respect to the classesQISm andQISsyncm of quantified interpreted systems directly follows from Lemma 10 together with Theorem 3. Thus, we obtain the following item in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 4 (Completeness). The system QKTm (resp. QKTCm) is complete w.r.t. the classes QISm and QISsyncm of QIS.\nTo prove completeness for QISuism and QISsync,uism we use the next result, which is an extension from the propositional case (Halpern et al., 2004).\nRemark 2. Suppose X is a subset of {pr, sync}. If \u03c6 \u2208 L1m (resp. LC1m) is satisfiable in QISXm then it is also satisfiable in QISX,uism .\nThus, the system QKTm (resp. QKTCm) is also complete w.r.t. the classes QISuism and QISsync,uism of QIS.\n5.2 The Classes QISprm and QISpr,uism We now begin to investigate systems where interactions between time and knowledge are present. The completeness proof for QKT1m with respect to QISprm and QISpr,uism relies on the following lemma.\nLemma 11. For all \u03b9-points P1 = \u3008C1, t1\u3009, P2 = \u3008C2, t2\u3009 and \u03b9]i-type t\u20322, if P1 \u21d2 P2 and t2 \u2248i t\u20322 then there is a \u03b9]i-point P\u20322 = \u3008C\u20322, t\u20322\u3009 and a \u21d2-sequence S1 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 Sn = P\u20322 of \u03b9]i-points such that Sk = \u3008Dk, sk\u3009, s1 \u2248i t1 and sk \u2248i t2 for 1 < k \u2264 n. Further, if P1 \u21d2c P2 then sck \u2208 T conDk for k \u2264 n.\nProof. We extend the proof of Halpern et al. (2004, Lemma 5.5) to deal with state candidates and monodic friendly Kripke frames. By the cited result we can prove that if t1 \u21d2 t2 and t2 \u2248i t\u20322 then there is a sequence of \u03b9]i-types s1 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 sn = t\u20322 such that s1 \u2248i t1 and sk \u2248i t2 for 1 < k \u2264 n. Now by Lemma 7 we can extend this sequence of \u03b9]i-types to a sequence of \u03b9]i-points S1 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 Sn such that Sk = \u3008Dk, sk\u3009 and the lemma\u2019s statement is satisfied. In particular, if P1 \u21d2c P2 also by Lemma 7 we can assume without loss of generality that sck \u2208 T conDk for k \u2264 n.\nFor any consistent \u03c6 \u2208 L1m we define a quasimodel+ for \u03c6 to establish the completeness of QKT1m with respect to QISprm . Let R be the set of all acceptable\u21d2-sequences, and define f such that f(r, k) = Ck if r is the \u21d2-sequence C0,C1, . . . . Finally, let O be the set of all functions \u03c1 associating every (r, n) \u2208 Dom(f) to a type \u03c1(r, n) \u2208 Tr,n such that conditions (A) and (B) above are satisfied and\n(C\u2019) if \u03c1(r, n) is a \u03b9-type, t is a \u03b9]i-type and \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i t, then for some (r\u2032, n\u2032), \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) = t.\n(E) if \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) and n > 0 then either (a) \u03c1(r, n \u2212 1) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) or (b) there is k < n\u2032 such that \u03c1(r, n \u2212 1) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, k) and for all k\u2032, k < k\u2032 \u2264 n\u2032 implies \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, k\u2032).\nFinally, for i \u2208 Ag, \u03c1 \u2208 O, we define (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032). The following lemma shows that the set O is non-empty. In particular, conditions (C\u2019) and (E) are satisfied by the functions in O.\nLemma 12. The set O of functions that satisfies conditions (A), (B), (C\u2019) and (E) is non-empty.\nProof. Conditions (A) and (B) follow respectively from Lemma 6(ii)(a) and the fact that r is an acceptable\u21d2-sequence. As regards (C\u2019) and (E), the proof proceeds by induction on n. The result for n = 0 is immediate, as we can take r\u2032 to be an acceptable \u21d2-sequence starting from C such that t \u2208 C. Further, we define \u03c1(r\u2032, 0) = t. Thus, \u03c1(r\u2032, 0) \u2248i \u03c1(r, 0) and both (C\u2019) and (E) are satisfied.\nNow suppose that n > 0 and the result holds for n \u2212 1. Since f(r, n \u2212 1) \u21d2 f(r, n) and \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i t, it follows by Lemma 11 that there is a \u03b9]i-point P = \u3008C, t\u3009 and a\u21d2-sequence of \u03b9]i-points P\u2032 \u21d2 S0 \u21d2 . . .\u21d2 Sk = P such that Sk\u2032 = \u3008Dk\u2032 , sk\u2032\u3009 and sk\u2032 \u2248i \u03c1(r, n) for k\u2032 \u2264 k. By the induction hypothesis, there exists for every \u03b9]i-type s such that \u03c1(r, n\u22121) \u2248i s a point (r\u2032, n\u2032) and \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) = s. In case (a), we take s = t; then we have that \u03c1(r, n\u22121) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) for \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) = t. Thus, it is also the case that \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032). In case (b), we take s = t\u2032. Hence, \u03c1(r, n \u2212 1) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) for \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) = t\u2032. Now suppose that r\u2032 is derived from the acceptable \u21d2-sequence v0, v1, . . .. Let r\u2032\u2032 be the run derived from an acceptable sequence with initial segment v0, . . . , vn\u2032 ,D0, . . . ,Dk. Again, such a run exists by Lemma 8. We define \u03c1(r\u2032\u2032, n\u2032 + k + 1) = sk = t. Thus, we have \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032\u2032, n\u2032 + k + 1) and both (C\u2019) and (E) are satisfied.\nWe can now prove the following lemma.\nLemma 13. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a frame that satisfies perfect recall.\nProof. By Lemmas 6(i), 8 and 12 the sets R and O are non-empty. Also, f satisfies the conditions in Definition 17. Finally, each \u223ci,\u03c1 is an equivalence relation by definition, and it satisfies perfect recall by definition of the functions \u03c1 in O.\nFinally, we prove the main result in this section.\nLemma 14. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a quasimodel+ for \u03c6 with perfect recall and it validates the formulas K and BF .\nProof. By the previous lemma \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a frame satisfying perfect recall; so we are left to prove that the functions in O are objects+. Conditions (1)-(4\u2019) on objects+ are safisfied by remarks (A)-(E) and the definition of \u223ci,\u03c1. Furthermore, conditions (1), (2) and (3) on quasimodels+ are satisfied by the definitions of R, f and \u223ci,\u03c1. As regards (4), it follows from Lemma 11. Finally, condition (5) on quasimodels+ holds by Lemma 6(ii)(b), (d), (f) and (h) and Lemma 11. Finally, Q validates both the formulas K and BF , as all t \u2208 C, for all C \u2208 Q, are consistent with QKTm.\nThis completes the proof for QISprm . Thus, we obtain the following item in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 5 (Completeness). The system QKT1m is complete w.r.t. the class QISprm of QIS.\nThe completeness of QKT1m with respect to QISpr,uism follows by Remark 2.\n5.3 The Classes QISpr,syncm and QISpr,sync,uism The completeness of QKT2m with respect to QISpr,syncm is proved similarly to the previous case by using the following lemma instead of Lemma 11.\nLemma 15. For \u03b9-state candidates C1, C2 and \u03b9]i-state candidate C\u20322, there is a \u03b9]i-state candidate C\u20321 such that\n\u2022 if C1 \u21d2 C2 and C2 \u2248i C\u20322 then C1 \u2248i C\u20321 and C\u20321 \u21d2 C\u20322.\n\u2022 for c \u2208 con\u03c6, for P1 = \u3008C1, t1\u3009, P2 = \u3008C2, t2\u3009 and P\u20322 = \u3008C\u20322, t\u20322\u3009, if P1 \u21d2c P2 and P2 \u2248ci P\u20322 then for P\u20321 = \u3008C\u20321, t\u20321\u3009, P1 \u2248ci P\u20321 and P\u20321 \u21d2c P\u20322.\nProof. if C1 \u21d2 C2 and C2 \u2248i C\u20322 then there exist t1 \u2208 C1, t2 \u2208 C2 and t\u20322 \u2208 C\u20322 such that t1 \u21d2 t2 and t2 \u2248i t\u20322. Moreover, without loss of generality we can assume that for some c \u2208 con\u03c6, tc1 \u2208 T con1 , tc2 \u2208 T con2 and t\u2032c2 \u2208 T \u2032con2 . Following the proof by Halpern et al. (2004, Lemma 5.8) we can find a \u03b9]i-type t\u20321 such that t1 \u2248i t\u20321 and t\u20321 \u21d2 t\u20322. Define T \u20321 as the set of all such t\u20321 and T \u2032con 1 as the set of t \u2032c 1 . We can show that C \u2032 1 = \u3008T \u20321, T \u2032con1 \u3009 is a consistent \u03b9]i-state candidate such that C1 \u2248i C\u20321, C\u20321 \u21d2 C\u20322, and for c \u2208 con\u03c6, P1 \u2248ci P\u20321 and P\u20321 \u21d2c P\u20322.\nFor any consistent \u03c6 \u2208 L1m we define a quasimodel+ for \u03c6 to establish the completeness of QKT2m with respect to QISpr,syncm . Let R be the set of all \u21d2-sequences acceptable from n, for some n \u2208 N, and define f such that f(r, k) = Ck if r is the \u21d2-sequence X, . . . ,X,Cn,Cn+1, . . . acceptable from n and k \u2265 n, and undefined otherwise. Finally, let O be the set of all functions \u03c1 associating every (r, n) \u2208 Dom(f) to a type \u03c1(r, n) \u2208 Tr,n such that conditions (A) and (B) in Section 5.1 are satisfied and\n(C\u201d) if \u03c1(r, n) is a \u03b9-type, t is a \u03b9]i-type and \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i t, then for some (r\u2032, n), \u03c1(r\u2032, n) = t.\n(F) if \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n) and n > 0 then \u03c1(r, n\u2212 1) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2212 1).\nFinally, for i \u2208 Ag, \u03c1 \u2208 O, we define (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) and n = n\u2032. The following remark shows that the set O is non-empty. In particular, conditions (C\u201d) and (F) are satisfied by the functions in O.\nLemma 16. The set O of functions that satisfies condition (A), (B), (C\u201d) and (F) is non-empty.\nProof. Conditions (A) and (B) follow from Lemma 6(ii)(a) and the fact that r is an acceptable \u21d2-sequence. As regards (C\u201d) and (F), assume that \u03c1(r, n) \u2208 f(r, n) is a \u03b9-type, t is a \u03b9]i-type and \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i t. For each s \u2208 f(r, n) different from \u03c1(r, n) consider the set U = {\u03c8 | Ki\u03c8 \u2208 s}. We can check that U is consistent and it can be extended to a \u03b9]i-type s\u2032 such that s \u2248i s\u2032. Now define T \u2032 as the collection of all these s\u2032. Further, for each sc \u2208 T con, we set s\u2032c \u2208 T \u2032con. Let C\u2032 = \u3008T \u2032, T \u2032con\u3009. Clearly, C \u2248i C\u2032 and \u3008C, s\u3009 \u2248ci \u3008C\u2032, s\u2032\u3009. By Lemma 15 we can construct a \u21d2-sequence C0 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 Cn such that Cn = C\u2032 and f(r, k) \u2248i Ck for k \u2264 n. By Lemma 8 we can extend this \u21d2-sequence to an infinite acceptable \u21d2-sequence r\u2032. In particular, the function \u03c1 can be extended so that for k \u2264 n, \u03c1(r, k) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, k) and \u03c1(r\u2032, n) = t. Thus, both (C\u201d) and (F) are satisfied.\nWe can now show the following lemma.\nLemma 17. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a frame that satisfies perfect recall and synchronicity.\nProof. By Lemmas 6(i), 8 and 16 the sets R and O are non-empty. Also, f satisfies the conditions in Definition 17. Finally, each \u223ci,\u03c1 is an equivalence relation by definition, and it satisfies perfect recall and synchronicity by definition of the functions in O.\nNow we prove the main result.\nLemma 18. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a quasimodel+ for \u03c6 with perfect recall and synchronicity, and it validates the formulas K and BF .\nProof. By the previous lemma \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a frame satisfying perfect recall and synchronicity; so we are left to prove that the functions in O are objects+. Conditions (1)-(4\u2019) on objects+ are safisfied by the remarks (A)-(F) and the definition of \u223ci,\u03c1. Furthermore, conditions (1), (2) and (3) on quasimodels+ are satisfied by the definitions of R, f and \u223ci,\u03c1. As regards condition (4), we can make use of Lemma 15 to show that it holds. Additionally, (5) holds by Lemma 6(ii)(b), (d), (f) and (h) and Lemma 15. Finally, Q validates both the formulas K and BF , as all t \u2208 C, for all C \u2208 Q, are consistent with QKTm.\nThis completes the proof for QKT2m. Thus, we obtain the following item in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 6 (Completeness). The system QKT2m is complete w.r.t. the class QISpr,syncm of QIS.\nThe completeness of QKT2m with respect to QISpr,sync,uism follows again by Remark 2.\n5.4 The Class QISnlm First, we give the following definitions, which will be used in the completeness proof.\nDefinition 21. If t is a \u03b9-type, then \u03a6t,i is the conjunction of all \u03b9-types t\u2032 such that t \u2248i t\u2032. Similarly, if P is a \u03b9-point, then \u03a6P,i is the set of \u03b9-points P\u2032 such that P \u2248i P\u2032.\nDefinition 22. Two sequences of types \u039b and \u039b\u2032 are \u2248i-concordant if there is some n \u2208 N (or n may be \u221e) and non-empty consecutive intervals \u039b1, . . . ,\u039bn of \u039b and \u039b\u20321, . . . ,\u039b\u2032n of \u039b\u2032 such that for all s \u2208 \u039bj and s\u2032 \u2208 \u039b\u2032j we have s \u2248i s\u2032 for j \u2264 n.\nTwo sequences \u03a0 and \u03a0\u2032 of state candidates are \u2248i-concordant if for all t \u2208 C, for either C \u2208 \u03a0 or C \u2208 \u03a0\u2032, there are two sequences \u039b and \u039b\u2032 of types in \u03a0 and \u03a0\u2032 respectively that are \u2248i-concordant.\nTo prove the completeness of QKT3m with respect toQISnlm we need the following lemma, which is dual to Lemma 11.\nLemma 19. For all \u03b9-points P1 = \u3008C1, t1\u3009, P2 = \u3008C2, t2\u3009 and \u03b9]i-type t\u20321, if P1 \u21d2 P2 and t1 \u2248i t\u20321 then there exists a \u03b9]i-point P\u20321 = \u3008C\u20321, t\u20321\u3009 and a \u21d2-sequence P\u20321 = S1 \u21d2 . . .\u21d2 Sn of \u03b9]i-points such that Sk = \u3008Dk, sk\u3009, sk \u2248i t1 for k < n, and t2 \u2248i sn. Further, if P1 \u21d2c P2 then sck \u2208 T conDk for k \u2264 n.\nProof. By adapting the result of Halpern et al. (2004, Lemma 5.11) to types we can prove that if t1 \u21d2 t2 and t1 \u2248i t\u20321 then there is a sequence of \u03b9]i-types t\u20321 = s0 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 sn such that sk \u2248i t1 for k < n and sn \u2248i t2. Now by Lemma 7 we can extend this sequence of \u03b9]i-types to a sequence of \u03b9]i-points S1 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 Sn such that Sk = \u3008Dk, sk\u3009. So, the\nstatement of the lemma is satisfied. In particular, if P1 \u21d2c P2 then by Lemma 7 we can assume without loss of generality that sck \u2208 T conDk for k \u2264 n.\nAs pointed out by Halpern et al. (2004), Lemma 19 is not sufficient to construct a quasimodel+ that satisfies no learning. In fact, given a \u21d2-sequence \u03a3 = C0,C1, . . . of \u03b9state candidates and a \u03b9]i-type t\u20320 such that t0 \u2248i t\u20320 for t0 \u2208 C0, by Lemma 19 we can find a \u21d2-sequence \u03a3\u2032 = C\u20320,C\u20321, . . . such that t\u20320 \u2208 C\u20320 and no learning is satisfied. However, it does not follow from the acceptability of \u03a3 that \u03a3\u2032 is also acceptable. So, as in the propositional case, we have to work with trees of state candidates. Hereafter we extend the definitions given by Halpern et al. (2004) to be able to deal with points and monodic friendly Kripke models.\nDefinition 23. Let k \u2264 ad(\u03c6). A k-tree of state candidates for \u03c6 is a set \u03a0 of \u03b9-state candidates for \u03c6 with |\u03b9| \u2264 k that contains a unique -state candidate, i.e., the root, and for every \u03b9-point t in some C \u2208 \u03a0,\n\u2022 if t\u2032 is a \u03b9]i-type such that t \u2248i t\u2032 and |\u03b9]i| \u2264 k then there is some \u03b9]i-state candidate C\u2032 \u2208 \u03a0 such that t\u2032 \u2208 C\u2032;\n\u2022 if \u03b9 = \u03b9\u2032]i then there is a \u03b9\u2032-state candidate C\u2032 \u2208 \u03a0 and a \u03b9\u2032-type t\u2032 \u2208 C\u2032 such that t \u2248i t\u2032.\nSimilarly, we define a k-tree of points for \u03c6 as a set \u03a3 of \u03b9-points for \u03c6 with |\u03b9| \u2264 k that contains a unique -point, and for every \u03b9-point P = \u3008C, t\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3,\n\u2022 if t\u2032 is a \u03b9]i-type such that t \u2248i t\u2032 and |\u03b9]i| \u2264 k, then there is some \u03b9]i-point P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3;\n\u2022 if \u03b9 = \u03b9\u2032]i then there is a \u03b9\u2032-point P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3 such that t \u2248i t\u2032.\nIntuitively, a k-tree is a view of the epistemic state of our quasimodel from a particular type t, up to k steps from t. We now extend the \u00a9-suitability relation \u21d2 to k-trees.\nDefinition 24. Let \u03a0 and \u03a0\u2032 be k-trees of state candidates for \u03c6. We say that \u03a0 \u21d2f \u03a0\u2032 whenever f is a function associating with each \u03b9-state candidate C \u2208 \u03a0 and each \u03b9-type t \u2208 C finite \u21d2-sequences of \u03b9-state candidates in \u03a0 \u222a\u03a0\u2032 and \u03b9-types such that:\n1. if f(C) = C0 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 Ck then (a) C = C0 and (b) Cj \u2208 \u03a0 for j < k and Ck \u2208 \u03a0\u2032. Similarly, if f(t) = t0 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 tk then (a) t = t0 and (b) tj \u2208 Cj for j < k and tk \u2208 Ck.\n2. Let t \u2208 C and t\u2032 \u2208 C\u2032 for some C, C\u2032 \u2208 \u03a0. If t \u2248i t\u2032 then f(t) and f(t\u2032) are \u2248iconcordant;\n3. for at least one C \u2208 \u03a0 the sequence f(C) has a length of at least 2.\nFurther, let \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2032 be k-trees of points for \u03c6. We say that \u03a3 \u21d2f \u03a3\u2032 whenever f is a function associating with each \u03b9-point P \u2208 \u03a3 a finite \u21d2-sequence of \u03b9-points in \u03a3\u222a\u03a3\u2032 such that:\n1. if f(P) = P0 \u21d2 . . .\u21d2 Pk then (a) P = P0 and (b) Pj \u2208 \u03a3 for j < k and Pk \u2208 \u03a3\u2032;\n2. Let P = \u3008C, t\u3009 and P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 be in \u03a3. If t \u2248i t\u2032 then f(t) and f(t\u2032) are \u2248i-concordant;\n3. for at least one P \u2208 \u03a3 the sequence f(P) has a length of at least 2.\nFinally, for any constant c \u2208 con\u03c6, we say that \u03a3 \u21d2cf \u03a3\u2032 whenever \u03a3 \u21d2f \u03a3\u2032 and f(P) = P0 \u21d2c . . .\u21d2c Pk.\nNotice that given a k-tree \u03a0 of state candidates with root C and t \u2208 C, we can obtain a k-tree \u03a3 of points such that P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3 iff C\u2032 \u2208 \u03a0. Also, if \u03a0, \u03a0\u2032 are k-tree of state candidates and \u03a0\u21d2f \u03a0\u2032, then we also have \u03a3\u21d2f \u03a3\u2032 where \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2032 are k-trees of points based on \u03a0 and \u03a0\u2032 respectively.\nWe now show how to obtain acceptable sequences of state candidates from sequences of trees. Given two sequences of \u03b9-state candidates \u03bb = C0, . . . ,Ck and \u00b5 = C\u20320, . . ., where \u03bb is finite, the fusion \u03bb \u00b7 \u00b5 is defined as C0, . . . ,Ck\u22121,C\u20320, . . . only if Ck = C\u20320. Further, given an infinite sequence \u0398 = \u03a00 \u21d2f0 \u03a01 \u21d2f1 . . . of k-trees, we say that a sequence \u03bb of \u03b9-state candidates is compatible with \u0398 if there exists some h \u2208 N and \u03b9-state candidates Ch,Ch+1, . . ., with Cj \u2208 \u03a0j for j \u2265 h, such that \u03bb = fh(Ch) \u00b7 fh+1(Ch+1) \u00b7 . . .. The sequence \u0398 is acceptable if every \u21d2-sequence compatible with \u0398 is infinite and acceptable.\nThe basic idea of the completeness proof is to define the quasimodel+ starting from an acceptable sequence \u0398. Next we introduce some definitions and lemmas that are essential for the completeness proof.\nGiven a k-tree \u03a3 and a \u03b9-point P \u2208 \u03a3 we inductively define the formula tree\u03a3,P that describes the k-tree \u03a3 from the viewpoint of P.\nDefinition 25. If P is a -point, then tree\u03a3,P ::= \u03b2P. If P is a \u03b9\u2032]i-point with \u03b9\u2032 6= \u03b9\u2032]i then\ntree\u03a3,P = \u03b2P \u2227 \u2227\n{\u03b9\u2032\u2212point P\u2032\u2208\u03a3|t\u2032\u2248it}\nK\u0304itree\u03a3,P\u2032\nIf \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2032 are k-trees, P \u2208 \u03a3 and P\u2032 \u2208 \u03a3\u2032, then we write (\u03a3,P)\u21d2+ (\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032) if there is a sequence of k-trees \u03a30, . . . ,\u03a3l and functions f0, . . . , fl\u22121 such that (a) \u03a3 = \u03a30 \u21d2f0 . . .\u21d2fl\u22121 \u03a3l = \u03a3\u2032; (b) fj(P) = P for j \u2264 l\u2212 2 and fl\u22121(P) = (P,P\u2032). Similarly, (\u03a3,P)\u21d2c+ (\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032) if (\u03a3,P)\u21d2+ (\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032) and (a\u2019) \u03a3 = \u03a30 \u21d2cf0 . . .\u21d2 c fl\u22121\n\u03a3l = \u03a3\u2032. We prove the following lemma, which extends a result by Halpern et al. (2004, Lemma 5.12)\nto points.\nLemma 20. Suppose \u03a3 is a k-tree of points and P = \u3008C, t\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3 is a \u03b9-point with |\u03b9| = k,\n(a) If t\u2032 is a \u03b9-type and tree\u03a3,P \u2227\u00a9(t\u2032 \u2227 \u03be) is consistent, then there is a k-tree \u03a3\u2032 and a \u03b9-point P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3\u2032 such that (\u03a3,P)\u21d2+ (\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032) and tree\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032 \u2227 \u03be is consistent. Further, if tc \u2208 T con then (\u03a3,P)\u21d2c+ (\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032).\n(b) ` tree\u03a3,P \u2192\u00a9 \u2228 {(\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032)|(\u03a3,P)\u21d2+(\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032)} tree\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032\n(c) if tree\u03a3,P \u2227 \u03c8U\u03c8\u2032 is consistent, then there is a sequence \u03a30, . . . ,\u03a3l of k-trees and points P0, . . . ,Pl such that (i) Pj \u2208 \u03a3j for j \u2264 l; (ii) (\u03a30,P0) = (\u03a3,P); (iii) (\u03a3j ,Pj) \u21d2+ (\u03a3j+1,Pj+1) for j < l; (iv) tree\u03a3j ,Pj \u2227 \u03c8 is consistent for j < l; (v) tree\u03a3l,Pl\u2227\u03c8\u2032 is consistent. Further, if tc \u2208 T con then (iii\u2019) (\u03a3j ,Pj)\u21d2c+ (\u03a3j+1,Pj+1) for j < l.\nProof. We proceed by induction on k. The case for k = 0 is immediate using standard arguments as tree\u03a3,P is just \u03b2P.\nAssume that k > 0 and \u03b9 = \u03b9\u2032]i for \u03b9 6= \u03b9\u2032. We first prove part (a) for \u03be = Ki\u03be\u2032, then part (b), then the general case for (a), and finally (c). As regards part (a) for \u03be = Ki\u03be\u2032, note that tree\u03a3,P \u2227\u00a9(t\u2032 \u2227Ki\u03be\u2032) implies that\ntree\u03a3,P \u2227Ki\u03a6P,iUKi(\u03be\u2032 \u2227 \u03a6t\u2032,i)\nBy the definition of k-tree there is a \u03b9\u2032-point P\u2217 \u2208 \u03a3 such that t \u2248i t\u2217. Let \u03a3\u2217 be the (k \u2212 1)-tree consisting of all \u03b9\u2217-points in \u03a3 for |\u03b9\u2217| \u2264 k \u2212 1. By the axiom KT3 also tree\u03a3\u2217,P\u2217\u2227Ki\u03a6P,iUKi(\u03be\u2032\u2227\u03a6t\u2032,i) is consistent, and by part (c) there is a sequence \u03a30, . . . ,\u03a3l of (k \u2212 1)-trees and points P0, . . . ,Pl such that (i) Pj \u2208 \u03a3j for j \u2264 l; (ii) (\u03a30,P0) = (\u03a3\u2217,P\u2217); (iii) (\u03a3j ,Pj) \u21d2+ (\u03a3j+1,Pj+1) for j < l; (iv) tree\u03a3j ,Pj \u2227Ki\u03a6P,i is consistent for j < l; (v) tree\u03a3l,Pl \u2227Ki(\u03be\u2032 \u2227 \u03a6t\u2032,i) is consistent.\nAgain, by the definition of the relation\u21d2+ there is a sequence of (k\u22121)-trees \u03930, . . . ,\u0393m and functions f0, . . . , fm\u22121 such that (a) \u03a3\u2217 = \u03a30 = \u03930 \u21d2f0 . . .\u21d2fm\u22121 \u0393m = \u03a3l. Moreover, there are (k\u22121)-points u0, . . . , um such that u0 = P\u2217, um = Pl, and for j < m, uj = Pj\u2032 for some j\u2032 \u2264 j, and if uj = uj+1 then fj(uj) = uj , while if uj 6= uj+1 then fj(uj) = (uj , uj+1).\nWe now show how to define the k-tree \u0393\u2032j extending \u0393j for j < m. By (iv) above \u03b2uj \u2227 Ki\u03a6P,i is consistent for j < m, and we have that uj \u2248i P. So P \u2208 \u0393\u2032j . Similarly, \u03b2um \u2227Ki\u03a6t\u2032,i is consistent; so there exists P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 such that P\u2032 \u2208 \u0393\u2032m. Further, we can saturate each \u0393\u2032j so that the conditions on k-trees are satisfied and in particular \u0393 \u2032 0 = \u03a3. We now show how to construct f \u2032j for j < m. For each point S \u2032 = \u3008D\u2032, s\u2032\u3009 \u2208 \u0393\u2032j \\ \u0393j there must exist a point S = \u3008D, s\u3009 \u2208 \u0393j and an agent j\u2032 \u2208 Ag such that s \u2248j\u2032 s\u2032. From Lemma 19 it follows that there exists a sequence \u03bbS\u2032 starting with S\u2032 that is \u2248j\u2032-concordant with fj(S). Moreover, we can take \u03bbPj = (P) for j < m\u2212 1, and \u03bbPm\u22121 = (P,P\u2032). We define f \u2032j such that it agrees with fj on \u0393j , and for S\u2032 \u2208 \u0393\u2032j \\ \u0393j we have f \u2032j(S\u2032) = \u03bbS\u2032 .\nNotice that \u0393\u20320 = \u03a3 by construction. If m > 0 it follows immediately from the definition that (\u03a3,P) \u21d2+ (\u0393m,P\u2032) and that tree\u0393m,P\u2032 \u2227 Ki\u03be\u2032 is consistent. If m = 0 we can easily check that we have P\u2032 \u2208 \u03a3 as t\u2217 \u2248i t\u2032. Since we also have t\u2217 \u2248i t, it follows that t \u2248i t\u2032. We define f so that f(u) = u for every u 6= P and f(P) = (P,P\u2032). Then (\u03a3,P) \u21d2f (\u03a3,P\u2032). Since also P\u21d2 P\u2032 we have (\u03a3,P)\u21d2+ (\u03a3,P\u2032).\nThe second part of (a) follows by a similar line of reasoning. To prove part (b), by contradiction we assume that\n0 tree\u03a3,P \u2192\u00a9 \u2228\n{(\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032)|(\u03a3,P)\u21d2+(\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032)}\ntree\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032\nThen tree\u03a3,P \u2227 \u00a9 \u2227 {(\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032)|(\u03a3,P)\u21d2+(\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032)} \u00actree\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032 is consistent. By temporal reasoning there must be some point u such that\ntree\u03a3,P \u2227\u00a9(\u03b2u \u2227 \u2227\n{(\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032)|(\u03a3,P)\u21d2+(\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032)}\n\u00actree\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032) (33)\nis consistent. Note that \u00actree\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032 is equivalent to \u00ac\u03b2P\u2032\u2228 \u2228 {\u03b9\u2032\u2212point P\u2217\u2208\u03a3\u2032|t\u2217\u2248it\u2032}Ki\u00actree\u03a3\u2032,P\u2217 . Thus, the consistency of (33) implies that for each tree \u03a3\u2032 such that (\u03a3,P)\u21d2+ (\u03a3\u2032, u) there\nexists a \u03b9\u2032-point P\u03a3\u2032 = \u3008C\u03a3\u2032 , t\u03a3\u2032\u3009 such that t\u03a3\u2032 \u2248i tu and\ntree\u03a3,P \u2227\u00a9(\u03b2u \u2227Ki( \u2227\n{\u03a3\u2032|(\u03a3,P)\u21d2+(\u03a3\u2032,P\u03a3\u2032 )}\n\u00actree\u03a3\u2032,P\u03a3\u2032 )) (34)\nis consistent. By part (a) there exists a k tree \u03a3\u2217 and P\u2217 \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 such that (\u03a3,P)\u21d2+ (\u03a3\u2217,P\u2217) and tree\u03a3\u2217,P\u2217\u2227\u03b2u\u2227Ki( \u2227 {\u03a3\u2032|(\u03a3,P)\u21d2+(\u03a3\u2032,P\u03a3\u2032 )}\n\u00actree\u03a3\u2032,P\u03a3\u2032 ) is consistent. But this means that P\u2217 = u. Thus we have a contradiction, since tree\u03a3\u2217,u \u2227Ki\u00actree\u03a3\u2217,P\u03a3\u2217 is inconsistent.\nThe general case for (a) follows from (b). Part (c) also follows from (b). The following lemma is the correspondent of Lemma 8 for k-trees.\nLemma 21. If \u03c6 \u2208 L1m is consistent with QKT3m, then there exists an acceptable sequence \u0398 of ad(\u03c6)-trees of state candidates such that \u03c6 belongs to the root of the first tree.\nProof. As in Lemma 8 the key part of this proof consists of showing that, given a finite sequence \u03a30 \u21d2f0 . . . \u21d2fl\u22121 \u03a3l of d-trees of points and a \u03b9-point P = \u3008C, t\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3l such that \u03c8U\u03c8\u2032 \u2208 t (resp. \u00a9\u03c8 \u2208 t), by Lemmas 19 and 20 we can extend the sequence of trees to satisfy acceptability. Specifically, suppose that \u03c8U\u03c8\u2032 \u2208 t. Let \u03a3 include P and the \u03b9\u2032-points P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3l with |\u03b9\u2032| \u2264 k = |\u03b9|. Note that \u03a3 is a k-tree. Further, by Lemma 20 we can find a sequence \u03980, . . . ,\u0398n of k-trees and points P0, . . . ,Pn such that (i) Pj \u2208 \u0398j for j \u2264 n; (ii) (\u03980,P0) = (\u03a3,P); (iii) (\u0398j ,Pj) \u21d2+ (\u0398j+1,Pj+1) for j < l; (iv) tree\u0398j ,Pj \u2227 \u03c8 is consistent for j < l; and (v) tree\u0398n,Pl \u2227 \u03c8\u2032 is consistent. By using Lemma 19 we can extend this to a sequence of ad(\u03c6)-trees starting with \u03a3l that satisfies \u03c8U\u03c8\u2032 as in the proof of Lemma 20(a). For \u00a9\u03c8 \u2208 t the argument is similar. Since \u03c6 is consistent, there must be some tree \u03a3 with root C such that \u03c8 \u2208 t for some t \u2208 C; we can then extend \u03a3 as above to complete the proof.\nFor any consistent \u03c6 \u2208 L1m we define a quasimodel+ for \u03c6 to establish the completeness of QKT3m with respect to QISnlm. Let R consist of all acceptable \u21d2-sequences compatible with the ad(\u03c6)-tree \u0398, while the function f is given by f(r, k) = Ck if r is the acceptable \u21d2-sequence C0,C1, . . .. Further, let O be the set of functions \u03c1 associating every (r, n) \u2208 Dom(f) to a type \u03c1(r, n) \u2208 Tr,n such that conditions (A), (B) and (C\u2019) given previously are satisfied and the following holds:\n(G) if \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) then either \u03c1(r, n+ 1) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) or there exists k > n\u2032 such that \u03c1(r, n+ 1) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, k) and for all k\u2032, k > k\u2032 \u2265 n\u2032 implies \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, k\u2032).\nFinally, for i \u2208 Ag, \u03c1 \u2208 O, (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032). As in the previous cases we have the following.\nLemma 22. The set O of functions that satisfies conditions (A), (B), (C\u2019) and (G) is non-empty.\nProof. Conditions (A) and (B) are guaranteed by Lemma 6(ii) and by the fact that r is an acceptable \u21d2-sequence respectively. As regards (C\u2019) and (G), assume that \u03c1(r, n) is a \u03b9-type, t is a \u03b9]i-type and \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i t. By using the proofs of Lemmas 20 and 19 we can find an acceptable \u21d2-sequence r\u2032 compatible with the d-tree \u0398 such that t \u2208 f(r\u2032, 0) and (G) is satisfied.\nWe can now show the following lemma.\nLemma 23. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a frame that satisfies no learning.\nProof. By Lemmas 6(i), 21 and 22 the sets R and O are non-empty. Also, f satisfies the conditions in Definition 17. Further, each \u223ci,\u03c1 is an equivalence relation by definition. Finally, the no learning condition is satisfied by definition of the functions in O.\nLemma 24. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a quasimodel+ for \u03c6 that satisfies no learning and validates the formulas K and BF .\nProof. By the previous lemma \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a frame satisfying no learning; so we are left to prove that the functions in O are objects+. Conditions (1)-(4\u2019) on objects+ are safisfied by remarks (A)-(G) and the definition of \u223ci,\u03c1. Furthermore, conditions (1), (2) and (3) on quasimodels+ are satisfied by the definitions of R, f and \u223ci,\u03c1. As regards (4) we use Lemma 19 to show that it holds. Finally, (5) holds by Lemma 6(ii)(b), (d), (f) and (h) and Lemma 19. Finally, Q validates both K and BF , as all t \u2208 C, for all C \u2208 Q, are consistent with QKTm.\nThis completes the proof for QKT3m. Thus, we obtain the following item in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 7 (Completeness). The system QKT3m is complete w.r.t. the class QISnlm of QIS.\n5.5 The Class QISnl,syncm To show that QKT4m is a complete axiomatisation for QISnl,syncm , analogously to Lemma 15, we need the following.\nLemma 25. For \u03b9-state candidate C1, C2 and \u03b9]i-state candidate C\u20321 there exists a \u03b9]i-state candidate C\u20322 such that\n\u2022 if C1 \u21d2 C2 and C1 \u2248i C\u20321 then C\u20321 \u21d2 C\u20322 and C2 \u2248i C\u20322.\n\u2022 for all c \u2208 con\u03c6, for P1 = \u3008C1, t1\u3009, P2 = \u3008C2, t2\u3009 and P\u20321 = \u3008C\u20321, t\u20321\u3009, if P1 \u21d2c P2 and P1 \u2248ci P\u20321 then P\u20321 \u21d2c P\u20322 and P2 \u2248ci P\u20322.\nProof. The proof is similar to Lemma 15. If C1 \u21d2 C2 and C1 \u2248i C\u20321 then there exist t1 \u2208 C1, t2 \u2208 C2 and t\u20321 \u2208 C\u20321 such that t1 \u21d2 t2 and t1 \u2248i t\u20321. Moreover, without loss of generality, we can assume that for some c \u2208 con\u03c6, tc1 \u2208 T con1 , tc2 \u2208 T con2 and t\u2032c1 \u2208 T \u2032con1 . By adapting the proof of Halpern et al. (2004, Lemma 5.18) we can find a \u03b9]i-type t\u20322 such that t2 \u2248i t\u20322 and t\u20321 \u21d2 t\u20322. We define T \u20322 as the set of all such t\u20322 and T \u2032con1 as the set of t\u2032c2 . Clearly, C\u20322 = \u3008T \u20322, T \u2032con2 \u3009 is a consistent \u03b9]i-state candidate such that C2 \u2248i C\u20322, C\u20321 \u21d2 C\u20322, and for c \u2208 con\u03c6, P2 \u2248ci P\u20322 and P\u20321 \u21d2c P\u20322.\nFor systems including the axiom KT4m we can define a synchronous version of the relation \u21d2 between k-trees.\nDefinition 26. If \u03a0 and \u03a0\u2032 are k-trees of state candidates for \u03c6 then \u03a0 \u21d2syncf \u03a0 \u2032 iff \u03a0 \u21d2f \u03a0\u2032 and for all C \u2208 \u03a0, f(C) has exactly a length of 2. Similarly, if \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2032 are k-trees of points for \u03c6 then \u03a3\u21d2syncf \u03a3\n\u2032 iff \u03a3\u21d2f \u03a3\u2032 and for all P \u2208 \u03a3, f(P) has exactly a length of 2.\nFor any c \u2208 con\u03c6, the relation \u21d2c syncf is defined similarly. We define a sync-acceptable sequence of trees as an acceptable sequence where the relation \u21d2 is substituted by the relation\u21d2sync, that is, the sequence \u0398 is acceptable if every\u21d2sync-sequence compatible with \u0398 is infinite and acceptable. Similarly, given the relations \u21d2+ and \u21d2c+ for c \u2208 con\u03c6, the definitions of\u21d2sync,+ and\u21d2c sync,+ are straightforward. We now state the following result, which is a simplified version of Lemma 20. The proof is analogous to that of Lemma 20, in which Lemma 25 is used instead of Lemma 19.\nLemma 26. Let \u03a3 be a k-tree of points and P \u2208 \u03a3 is a \u03b9-point with |\u03b9| = k,\n(a) If t\u2032 is a \u03b9-type and tree\u03a3,P \u2227 \u00a9(t\u2032 \u2227 \u03be) is consistent, then there exists a k-tree \u03a3\u2032 and a \u03b9-point P\u2032 = \u3008C\u2032, t\u2032\u3009 \u2208 \u03a3\u2032 such that (\u03a3,P) \u21d2sync,+ (\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032) and tree\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032 \u2227 \u03be is consistent. Further, if tc \u2208 T con then (\u03a3,P)\u21d2c sync,+ (\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032).\n(b) ` tree\u03a3,P \u2192\u00a9 \u2228 {(\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032)|(\u03a3,P)\u21d2sync,+(\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032)} tree\u03a3\u2032,P\u2032\n(c) if tree\u03a3,P \u2227 \u03c8U\u03c8\u2032 is consistent, then there exists a sequence \u03a30, . . . ,\u03a3l of k-trees and points P0, . . . ,Pl such that (i) Pj \u2208 \u03a3j for j \u2264 l; (ii) (\u03a30,P0) = (\u03a3,P); (iii) (\u03a3j ,Pj) \u21d2sync,+ (\u03a3j+1,Pj+1) for j < l; (iv) tree\u03a3j ,Pj \u2227 \u03c8 is consistent for j < l; and (v) tree\u03a3l,Pl \u2227\u03c8\u2032 is consistent. Further, if tc \u2208 T con then (iii\u2019) (\u03a3j ,Pj)\u21d2c sync,+ (\u03a3j+1,Pj+1) for j < l.\nFurther, we make use of Lemma 26 to adapt Lemma 21 and obtain the following result.\nLemma 27. If \u03c6 \u2208 L1m is consistent with QKT4m, then there exists a sync-acceptable sequence \u0398 of ad(\u03c6)-trees of state candidates such that \u03c6 belongs to the root of the first tree.\nFor any consistent \u03c6 \u2208 L1m we define a quasimodel+ for \u03c6 to establish the completeness of QKT4m with respect to QISnl,syncm . Let X be a new object, a sequence X, . . . ,X,Cn,Cn+1, . . . is sync-acceptable from n if it starts with n copies ofX and Cn,Cn+1, . . . is a sync-acceptable\u21d2-sequence compatible with the ad(\u03c6)-tree \u0398. Let R consist of all\u21d2sequences sync-acceptable from n, for some n \u2208 N. The function f is defined as f(r, k) = Ck if r is the\u21d2-sequence X, . . . ,X,Cn,Cn+1, . . . sync-acceptable from n and k \u2265 n; f(r, k) is undefined otherwise. Further, Let O be the set of functions \u03c1 associating every (r, n) \u2208 Dom(f) to a type \u03c1(r, n) \u2208 Tr,n such that conditions (A), (B) and (C\u201d) are satisfied and the following holds:\n(H) if \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) then \u03c1(r, n+ 1) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032 + 1).\nFinally, for i \u2208 Ag, \u03c1 \u2208 O, (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) and n = n\u2032. Similarly to Lemma 22, we can show the following.\nLemma 28. The set O of functions that satisfies conditions (A), (B), (C\u201d) and (H) above is non-empty.\nMoreover, the following result follows from Lemmas 6(i), 27 and 28.\nLemma 29. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a frame that satisfies no learning and synchronicity.\nFinally, by adapting the proof for Lemma 24 we can state the following result.\nLemma 30. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a quasimodel+ for \u03c6 with no learning and synchronicity, and it validates the formulas K and BF .\nThis completes the proof for QKT4m. Thus, we obtain the following item in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 8 (Completeness). The system QKT4m is complete w.r.t. the class QISnl,syncm of QIS.\n5.6 The Classes QISnl,prm and QIS nl,pr,uis 1\nTo obtain the completeness proof for QISnl,prm we combine the results shown for QISprm and QISnlm.\nIf \u03c6 \u2208 L1m is consistent with QKT 2,3 m then by Lemma 21 there exists an acceptable sequence \u0398 of ad(\u03c6)-trees such that \u03c6 belongs to the root of the first tree. Let R be the set of all acceptable \u21d2-sequences that have a suffix that is compatible with \u0398, while the function f is defined as in Section 5.2. Further, O is the set of all functions \u03c1 associating every (r, n) \u2208 Dom(f) to a type \u03c1(r, n) \u2208 Tr,n that satisfies the conditions (A), (B), (C\u2019), (E) and (G). Finally, for i \u2208 Ag, \u03c1 \u2208 O, (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032).\nLemma 31. The set O of functions that satisfies conditions (A), (B), (C\u2019), (E) and (G) is non-empty.\nProof. We can show that all conditions but (C\u2019) are satisfied similarly to the cases of QISprm and QISnlm. As to (C\u2019), suppose that \u03c1(r, n) is a \u03b9-type in f(r, n) and t is \u03b9]i-type. Also, \u0398 is the sequence of ad(\u03c6)-trees \u03a00 \u21d2f0 \u03a01 \u21d2f1 . . . of state candidates. The run r is derived by definition from a \u21d2-sequence C0,C1, . . . that has a suffix CN ,CN+1, . . . that is compatible with \u0398, and f(r, n) = Cn. We consider two cases.\nIf n \u2265 N , then there exists some k \u2208 N such that Cn \u2208 \u03a0k. By Lemma 11 there exists a \u21d2-sequence S0 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 Sh of \u03b9]i-state candidates such that t \u2208 Sh and S0, . . . ,Sh is \u2248i-concordant with C0, . . . ,Cn. Further, we can assume that Sh \u2208 \u03a0k and let Sh,Sh+1, . . . be the sequence compatible with \u0398. Now consider the \u21d2-sequence S0 \u21d2 S1 \u21d2 . . .. By construction the run r\u2032 derived from this sequence is in R and we can assume that \u03c1(r\u2032, h) = t.\nIf n < N , then by Lemma 11 there exists a \u21d2-sequence S0 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 Sh of \u03b9]i-state candidates such that t \u2208 Sh and S0, . . . ,Sh is\u2248i-concordant with C0, . . . ,Cn. By Lemma 19 we can extend this sequence to a \u21d2-sequence S0 \u21d2 . . . \u21d2 Sk that is \u2248i-concordant with C0, . . . ,CN . Since CN \u2208 \u03a0M for some M \u2208 N, we can assume that Sk \u2208 \u03a0M as well. Let Sh,Sh+1, . . . be the sequence compatible with \u0398, and consider the \u21d2-sequence S0 \u21d2 S1 \u21d2 . . .. As in the previous case, the run r\u2032 derived from this sequence is in R by construction and we can assume that \u03c1(r\u2032, h) = t.\nBy Lemmas 6(i), 21 and 31 we obtain the next result.\nLemma 32. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a frame that satisfies perfect recall and no learning.\nFinally, we state the following lemma, whose proof follows the lines of the corresponding proofs for QISprm and QISnlm and Lemma 31.\nLemma 33. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a quasimodel+ for \u03c6 that satisfies perfect recall and no learning, and validates the formulas K and BF .\nThis establishes the completeness of QKT2,3. Thus, we obtain the following item in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 9 (Completeness). The system QKT2,3m is complete w.r.t. the class QISnl,prm of QIS.\nThe completeness of QKT2,31 with respect to QIS nl,pr,uis 1 follows from the following\nremark, whose proof is analogous to the propositional case.\nRemark 3. A formula \u03c6 \u2208 L11 is satisfiable in QIS nl,pr 1 (resp. QIS nl,pr,sync 1 ) iff it is satisfiable in QISnl,pr,uis1 (resp. QIS nl,pr,sync,uis 1 ).\n5.7 The Class QISnl,pr,syncm To prove the completeness of QKT1,4m with respect to QISnl,pr,syncm we combine the results obtained for QISnl,prm in the previous section with those for QISnl,syncm and QISpr,syncm . Specifically, if \u03c6 \u2208 L1m is consistent with QKT 1,4 m by Lemma 27 we can construct a syncacceptable sequence \u0398 of ad(\u03c6)-trees such that \u03c6 belongs to the root of the first tree. Let R be the set of all sync-acceptable\u21d2-sequences with suffixes that are compatible with \u0398; and the function f is defined as in Section 5.2. Further, O is the set of all functions \u03c1 associating every (r, n) \u2208 Dom(f) to a type \u03c1(r, n) \u2208 Tr,n that satisfies the conditions (A), (B), (C\u201d), (F) and (H). Finally, for i \u2208 Ag, \u03c1 \u2208 O, (r, n) \u223ci,\u03c1 (r\u2032, n\u2032) iff \u03c1(r, n) \u2248i \u03c1(r\u2032, n\u2032) and n = n\u2032.\nBy adapting the proof of Lemma 31 by means of Lemmas 15 and 25 we can show the following result.\nLemma 34. The set O of functions that satisfies conditions (A), (B), (C\u201d), (F) and (H) is non-empty.\nBy Lemmas 6(i), 27 and 34 we obtain the following result.\nLemma 35. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a frame that satisfies perfect recall, no learning and synchronicity.\nFinally, we state the following lemma whose proof follows the lines of the corresponding proofs for QISpr,syncm , QISnl,syncm and Lemma 34.\nLemma 36. The tuple \u3008R,O, {\u223ci,\u03c1}i\u2208Ag,\u03c1\u2208O, f\u3009 is a quasimodel+ for \u03c6 that satisfies perfect recall, no learning and synchronicity, and validates the formulas K and BF .\nThis completes the proof for QKT1,4m . Thus, we obtain the following item in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 10 (Completeness). The system QKT1,4m is complete w.r.t. the class QISnl,pr,syncm of QIS.\n5.8 The Classes QISnl,sync,uism and QISnl,pr,sync,uism We now show that the system QKT1,4,5m is complete with respect to the classes QISnl,sync,uism and QISnl,pr,sync,uism . The completeness result follows from next remark.\nRemark 4. A formula \u03c6 \u2208 Lm is valid on QISnl,sync,uism iff it is valid in QISnl,pr,sync,uism .\nThe proof is a straightforward extension to first-order of a result by Halpern et al. (2004, Proposition 5.22). Given this remark and the axiom KT5 it is sufficient to prove the completeness of QKT1,41 with respect to QIS nl,pr,sync,uis 1 . By the result in the previous section, QKT1,41 is indeed complete with respect to QIS nl,pr,sync 1 . The desired result follows by Remark 3. Thus, we obtain the following item in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 11 (Completeness). The system QKT1,4m is complete w.r.t. the classes QISnl,sync,uism and QISnl,pr,sync,uism of QIS."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions and Further Work", "text": "In this paper we investigated interaction axioms in the context of monodic first-order temporal-epistemic logic. Specifically, we explored classes of quantified interpreted systems satisfying conditions such as synchronicity, no learning, perfect recall, and having a unique initial state. The contribution of the article concerns the provably complete axiomatisation of these classes.\nThe results presented extend previous contributions on first-order epistemic and temporal logic with no interactions (e.g., see Belardinelli & Lomuscio, 2011, Sturm et al., 2000, Wolter & Zakharyaschev, 2002), in a direction that was previously only explored at the propositional level (Halpern et al., 2004). Our findings show that the characterisation axioms considered at the propositional level can be extended to the first-order monodic setting.\nWhile temporal-epistemic logic in a first-order context has so far mostly attracted theoretical contributions, there is evidence in the literature of it being increasingly embraced in applications. For instance, there is an active interest in verifying artifact-centric systems against first-order modal specifications (Belardinelli, Lomuscio, & Patrizi, 2011a, 2011b; Deutsch, Hull, Patrizi, & Vianu, 2009; Deutsch, Sui, & Vianu, 2007; Calvanese, Giacomo, Lenzerini, & Rosati, 2012; Hariri, Calvanese, Giacomo, Masellis, & Felli, 2011).\nGiven this, it remains of importance to investigate the questions pertaining to computational aspects of the formalisms introduced, including their decidability and the computational complexity of the satisfiability and model checking problems. Work so far (including Belardinelli & Lomuscio, 2011; Hodkinson at al., 2000; Wolter & Zakharyaschev 2001) has focused on fragments where no interaction is present, but we know from the literature (Halpern et al., 2004) that interactions can make these problems harder. We leave this for further work, particularly in connection with the addition of other epistemic modalities (e.g., explicit and algorithmic knowledge, see Halpern & Pucella, 2005), or branching-time modalities. Epistemic variants of branching-time CTL are well understood at the propositional level (Meyden & Wong, 2003) but their first-order extensions have not yet been explored."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The research presented was supported by the European Commission through the Marie Curie Fellowship \u201cFoMMAS\u201d (grant n. 235329) and the STREP Project \u201cACSI\u201d (grant n. 257593), and by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Leadership Fellowship \u201cTrusted Autonomous Systems\u201d (grant n.
