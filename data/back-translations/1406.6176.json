Introduction", "text": "Learning the parameters of graphical models using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is generally hard due to the intractability of computing the normalizing constant and its gradients. Maximum pseudo-likelihood (PL) estimation [2] is a statistical approximation of the ML estimation. Unlike the ML estimation, the maximum PL estimation is computationally fast, but however, the estimates obtained by this method are not very accurate.\nComposite likelihoods (CLs) [6] are higher-order generalizations of the PL. Asymptotic analysis shows that maximum CL estimation is statistically more efficient than the maximum PL estimation [5]. It has been known that the maximum PL estimation is asymptotically consistent [2]. Like this, the maximum CL estimation is also asymptotically consistent [6]. Furthermore, the maximum CL estimation has an asymptotic variance that is smaller than the maximum PL estimation but larger than ML estimation [5, 3]. Recently, it has been found that the maximum CL estimation corresponds to a block-wise contrastive divergence learning [1].\nIn the maximum CL estimation, one can freely choose the size of \u201cblocks\u201d which contain several vari-\nables, and it is widely believed that by increasing the size of blocks, one can capture more dependency relations in the model and increase the accuracy of the estimates [1]. In the first part of this paper, we introduce a systematic choice of blocks in the maximum CL estimation. In our proposed choice of blocks, it is guaranteed that one can obtain quantitatively closer value to the true likelihood by increasing the size of blocks. In the latter part of this paper, we apply our maximum CL estimation to restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) [4] and show results of numerical experiments using synthetic data."}, {"heading": "2. Composite Likelihood Estimation", "text": "For the n dimensional discrete random variable x := {xi | i \u2208 \u2126 = {1, 2, . . . , n}}, let us consider the probabilistic model expressed as\nP (x | \u03b8) := Z(\u03b8)\u22121 exp ( \u2212 E(x | \u03b8) ) , (1)\nwhere E(x | \u03b8) is the energy function having an arbitrary functional form and Z(\u03b8) := \u2211\nx exp\n(\n\u2212 E(x |\n\u03b8) )\nis the normalizing constant. Let us suppose that the data set composed of M data, D := {d(\u00b5) | \u00b5 = 1, 2, . . . ,M} is obtained. Each data is statisticallyindependent of each other. In the perspective of the ML estimation, we determine the optimal \u03b8 by maximizing the log-likelihood function defined by\nLML(\u03b8) := \u2211\nx\nQ(x) lnP (x | \u03b8), (2)\nwhere Q(x) is the empirical distribution of the data set, i.e. the histogram of data set, expressed by Q(x) := M\u22121\n\u2211M \u00b5=1 \u03b4(x,d (\u00b5)), where we define\n\u03b4(x,d(\u00b5)) :=\n{\n1 x = d(\u00b5) 0 x 6= d(\u00b5) .\nHowever, maximizing LML(\u03b8) with respect to \u03b8 is computationally expensive. This generally requires the computational cost of O(en) due to multiple summations.\nThe maximum CL estimation is a statistical approximation technique of the ML estimation [6]. In the maximum CL estimation, one divides \u2126 into some different subsets termed blocks, c1, c2, . . . cr \u2286 \u2126, with allowing overlaps among blocks. Note that the relation c1\u222ac2\u222a . . .\u222acr = \u2126 must be kept. We denote the family of these blocks, c1, c2, . . . cr, by F . For the family F , the CL is defined by\nLF(\u03b8) := \u039bF \u2211\nc\u2208F\n\u2211\nx\nQ(x) lnP (xc | xc\u0304, \u03b8), (3)\nwhere, for a set A \u2286 \u2126, the expression xA is defined as xA := {xi | i \u2208 A} and A\u0304 := \u2126 \\ A. The notation \u039bF is defined by \u039bF := |F|\u22121, where the notation | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 | denotes the size of the assigned set. From the Bayesian theorem, the conditional probability in the CL is obtained by P (xc | xc\u0304, \u03b8) = P (x | \u03b8) ( \u2211\nxc P (x |\n\u03b8) )\u22121\n. In the CL estimation, one maximizes the CL instead of the true log-likelihood. If each block is composed of just one variable, i.e. ci = {i} and r = n, the CL is reduced to the PL [2]. Hence, the CL can be regarded as a generalization of the PL. On the other hand, if r = 1 and c1 is composed of all variables, the CL is obviously equivalent to the true log-likelihoodLML(\u03b8).\nProposition 1. The CL generally is an upper bound on the true log-likelihood LML(\u03b8).\nProof. The relation between original log-likelihood and the CL can be expressed as LML(\u03b8) = LF(\u03b8)+RF (\u03b8), where the remainder term is defined as\nRF (\u03b8) := \u039bF \u2211\nc\u2208F\n\u2211\nx\nQ(x) ln \u2211\nxc\nP (x | \u03b8). (4)\nSince P (x | \u03b8) is a discrete distribution and \u039bF is positive, the remainder term, RF (\u03b8), is less than or equal to zero. Therefore, the inequality LML(\u03b8) \u2264 LF (\u03b8) is generally satisfied for any \u03b8 and for any choice of F ."}, {"heading": "2.1. Systematic Choice of Blocks", "text": "In this section, we introduce a particular choice of the blocks in which the CL has a good property. For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, we define the family Fk whose elements are all possible blocks composed of k different variables, i.e. Fk := {{i1, i2, . . . , ik} | i1 < i2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < ik \u2208 \u2126}. For example, when n = 4, F2 = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}} and\nF3 = {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4}}. For the family Fk, the CL is expressed as\nLFk(\u03b8) = \u039bFk \u2211\nc\u2208Fk\n\u2211\nx\nQ(x) lnP (xc | xc\u0304, \u03b8), (5)\nwhere \u039bFk = |Fk| \u22121 = k!(n \u2212 k)!/n!. It is noteworthy that LF1(\u03b8) is reduced to the PL and LFn(\u03b8) = LML(\u03b8).\nProposition 2. For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, the CLs for the family Fk is bounded as LF1(\u03b8) \u2265 LF2(\u03b8) \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 LFn(\u03b8) = LML(\u03b8) for any \u03b8.\nProof. The relation between LML(\u03b8) and LFk(\u03b8) is LML(\u03b8) = LFk(\u03b8) + RFk(\u03b8), where, from equation (4) the remainder term is RFk(\u03b8) = \u039bFk \u2211\nc\u2208Fk\n\u2211\nx Q(x) ln\n\u2211\nxc P (x | \u03b8). Let us con-\nsider the difference between the the remainder terms Dk(\u03b8) := RFk+1(\u03b8)\u2212RFk(\u03b8). After a short manipulation, the difference Dk(\u03b8) yields\nDk(\u03b8)\n= \u039bFk k \u2212 n \u2211\nc\u2208Fk\n\u2211\ni\u2208c\u0304\n\u2211\nx\nQ(x) ln\n\u2211\nxc P (x | \u03b8)\n\u2211\nxc,xi P (x | \u03b8)\n.\nHence, for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1, the inequality Dk(\u03b8) \u2265 0 holds, because P (x | \u03b8) is a discrete distribution. Therefore, for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n\u2212 1, the inequality\nLFk(\u03b8) \u2265 LFk+1(\u03b8) (6)\nis satisfied. From equation (6), we reach to the proposition.\nFrom propositions 1 and 2, we found that, for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1, the kth-order CL, LFk(\u03b8), is always an upper bound on the true log-likelihood and it monotonically approaches the true log-likelihood with the increase of k. Therefore, it is guaranteed that a larger k gives quantitatively better approximation of the true log-likelihood."}, {"heading": "3. Application to Restricted Boltzmann Machines", "text": "In this section, we apply the CL estimation to RBMs [4]. RBMs are Boltzmann machines consisting of visible variables, whose states can be observed, and hidden variables, whose states are not specified by observed data. RBMs are defined on (complete) bipartite graphs consisting of two layers. One of them is a layer of visible variables, termed visible layer, and the other one is a layer of hidden variables, termed hidden\nlayer. There are connections between visible variables and hidden variables, and any interlayer connections are not allowed.\nWe denote the sets of labels of visible variables and hidden variables by \u2126 and H , respectively, and we denote the state variable of visible variable i \u2208 \u2126 by xi and the state variable of hidden variable j \u2208 H by hj . All state variables are binary random variables that take +1 or \u22121. The joint distribution of RBM is represented by\nPRBM(x,h | \u03b8) \u221d exp ( \u2211\ni\u2208\u2126\n\u03b1ixi + \u2211\nj\u2208H\n\u03b2jhj\n+ \u2211\ni\u2208\u2126\n\u2211\nj\u2208H\nwi,jxihj\n)\n.

In equation (7), we denote \u03b8 = \u03b1\u222a\u03b2\u222aw for a short description.\nGiven an empirical distribution Q(x) for the visible variables, the log-likelihood of RBM in equation (7) is expressed as\nLML(\u03b8) = \u2211\nx\nQ(x) lnPRBM(x | \u03b8), (8)\nwhere PRBM(x | \u03b8) is the marginal distribution obtained by PRBM(x | \u03b8) = \u2211 h PRBM(x,h | \u03b8). The marginal distribution can be explicitly expressed as PRBM(x | \u03b8) \u221d exp ( \u2212 ERBM(x | \u03b8) )\n, where ERBM(x | \u03b8) := \u2212 \u2211 i\u2208\u2126 \u03b1ixi \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208H ln Cj(x | \u03b8) and Cj(x | \u03b8) := cosh ( \u03b2j + \u2211 i\u2208\u2126wi,jxi )\n. The CL estimation can be applied to the RBM. Indeed, the PL estimation for the RBM was introduced [7]. By applying equation (5) to equation (8), we can express the kthorder CL for the RBM as\nLFk(\u03b8)\n= \u039bFk \u2211\nc\u2208Fk\n\u2211\ni\u2208c\n\u03b1i\u3008xi\u3009D + \u2211\nj\u2208H\n\u3008ln Cj(x, \u03b8)\u3009D\n\u2212 \u039bFk \u2211\nc\u2208Fk\n\u2329\nln \u2211\nxc\nexp ( \u2212 E (c) RBM(x | \u03b8) )\n\u232a\nD\n,\n(9)\nwhere the notation \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u3009D denotes the average over the empirical distribution and E(c)RBM(x | \u03b8) := \u2212 \u2211\ni\u2208c \u03b1ixi \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208H ln Cj(x | \u03b8).

In the generative RBM, we set \u03b1i = 0.1, \u03b2j = \u22120.1 and wi,j = 0.2 for all i and j. We compare the first-, the second- and the third-order CL estimation with the exact ML estimation. We maximize the CLs, i.e. LF1(\u03b8), LF2(\u03b8) and LF3(\u03b8), and the true log-likelihood, LML(\u03b8), by using the gradient ascent method (GAM) with the update rate of 0.1. In the four different GAMs, the same initial values of parameters that are randomly generated are used.\nFigure 1 shows that the plot of the CLs shown in equation (9) and the true log-likelihood shown in (8) against the number of iterations of GAMs with the gradients (10)\u2013(12).
