INTRODUCTION\nA plethora of multimedia applications (web-based TV [2], [3], personalized video retrieval [4], personalized news aggregation [5], etc.) are emerging which require matching multimedia content generated by distributed sources with consumers exhibiting different interests. The matching is often performed by CAs (e.g., Dailymotion, Metacafe [6]) that are responsible for mining the content of numerous multimedia sources in search of finding content which is interesting for the users. Both the characteristics of the content and preference of the consumers are evolving over time. An example of the system with users, CAs and multimedia sources is given in Fig. 1.\nEach user is characterized by its context, which is a realvalued vector, that provides information about the users\u2019\nCopyright (c) 2015 IEEE.

We assume a model where users arrive sequentially to a CA, and based on the type (context) of the user, the CA requests content from either one of the multimedia sources that it is connected to or from another CA that it is connected to. The context can represent information such as age, gender, search query, previously consumed content, etc. It may also represent the type of the device that the user is using [7] (e.g., PDA, PC, mobile phone). The CA\u2019s role is to match its user with the most suitable content, which can be accomplished by requesting content from the most suitable multimedia source.1 Since both the content generated by the multimedia sources and the user\u2019s characteristics change over time, it is unknown to the CA which multimedia source to match with the user. This problem can be formulated as an online learning problem, where the CA learns the best matching by exploring matchings of users with different content providers. After a particular content matching is made, the user \u201cconsumes\u201d the content, and provides feedback/rating, such as like or dislike.2 It is this feedback that helps a CA learn the preferences of its users and the characteristics of the content that is provided by the multimedia sources. Since this\n1Although we use the term request to explain how content from a multimedia source is mined, our proposed method works also when a CA extracts the content from the multimedia source, without any decision making performed by the multimedia source.\n2Our framework also works when the feedback is missing for some users.\nar X\niv :1\n50 2.\n02 12\n5v 2\n[ cs\n.M M\n] 2\n4 M\nar 2\n01 5\n2 is a learning problem we equivalently call a CA, a content learner or simply, a learner.\nTwo possible real-world applications of content aggregation are business news aggregation and music aggregation. Business news aggregators can collect information from a variety of multinational and multilingual sources and make personalized recommendations to specific individuals/companies based on their unique needs (see e.g. [8]). Music aggregators enable matching listeners with music content they enjoy both within the content network of the listeners as well as outside this network. For instance, distributed music aggregators can facilitate the sharing of music collections owned by diverse users without the need for centralized content manager/moderator/providers (see e.g. [9]). A discussion of how these applications can be modeled using our framework is given in Section III. Moreover, our proposed methods are tested on real-world datasets related to news aggregation and music aggregation in Section VII.\nFor each CA i, there are two types of users: direct and indirect. Direct users are the users that visit the website of CA i to search for content. Indirect users are the users of another CA that requests content from CA i. A CA\u2019s goal is to maximize the number of likes received from its users (both direct and indirect). This objective can be achieved by all CAs by the following distributed learning method: all CAs learn online which matching action to take for its current user, i.e., obtain content from a multimedia source that is directly connected, or request content from another CA. However, it is not trivial how to use the past information collected by the CAs in an efficient way, due to the vast number of contexts (different user types) and dynamically changing user and content characteristics. For instance, a certain type of content may become popular among users at a certain point in time, which will require the CA to obtain content from the multimedia source that generates that type of content.\nTo jointly optimize the performance of the multimedia content aggregation system, we propose an online learning methodology that builds on contextual bandits [10], [11]. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using the notion of regret: the difference between the expected total reward (number of content likes minus costs of obtaining the content) of the best content matching strategy given complete knowledge about the user preferences and content characteristics and the expected total reward of the algorithm used by the CAs. When the user preferences and content characteristics are static, our proposed algorithms achieve sublinear regret in the number of users that have arrived to the system.3 When the user preferences and content characteristics are slowly changing over time, our proposed algorithms achieve timeaveraged regret, where > 0 depends on the rate of change of the user and content characteristics.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the related work and highlight the differences from our work. In Section III, we describe the decentralized content aggregation problem, the optimal content\n3We use index t to denote the number of users that have arrived so far. We also call t the time index, and assume that one user arrives at each time step.\nmatching scheme given the complete system model, and the regret of a learning algorithm with respect to the optimal content matching scheme. Then, we consider the model with unknown, static user preferences and content characteristics and propose a distributed online learning algorithm in Section IV. The analysis of the unknown, dynamic user preferences and content characteristics are given in Section VI. Using realworld datasets, we provide numerical results on the performance of our distributed online learning algorithms in Section VII. Finally, the concluding remarks are given in Section VIII."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "Related work can be categorized into two: related work on recommender systems and related work on online learning methods called multi-armed bandits."}, {"heading": "A. Related work on recommender systems and content matching", "text": "A recommender system recommends items to its users based on the characteristics of the users and the items. The goal of a recommender system is to learn which users like which items, and recommend items such that the number of likes is maximized. For instance, in [5], [12] a recommender system that learns the preferences of its users in an online way based on the ratings submitted by the users is provided. It is assumed that the true relevance score of an item for a user is a linear function of the context of the user and the features of the item. Under this assumption, an online learning algorithm is proposed. In contrast, we consider a different model, where the relevance score need not be linear in the context. Moreover, due to the distributed nature of the problem we consider, our online learning algorithms need an additional phase called the training phase, which accounts for the fact that the CAs are uncertain about the information of the other aggregators that they are linked with. We focus on the long run performance and show that the regret per unit time approaches zero when the user and content characteristics are static. An online learning algorithm for a centralized recommender which updates its recommendations as both the preferences of the users and the characteristics of items change over time is proposed in [13].\nThe general framework which exploits the similarities between the past users and the current user to recommend content to the current user is called collaborative filtering [14]\u2013[16]. These methods find the similarities between the current user and the past users by examining their search and feedback patterns, and then based on the interactions with the past similar users, matches the user with the content that has the highest estimated relevance score. For example, the most relevant content can be the content that is liked the highest number of times by similar users. Groups of similar users can be created by various methods such as clustering [15], and then, the matching will be made based on the content matched with the past users that are in the same group.\nThe most striking difference between our content matching system and previously proposed is that in prior works, there is a central CA which knows the entire set of different types of\n3 Our work [5], [12] [15] [14] [19] Distributed Yes No No No No\nReward model Ho\u0308lder Linear N/A N/A N/A Confidence bounds Yes No No No No\nRegret bound Yes Yes No No No Dynamic user Yes No Yes Yes Yes\n/content distribution\nTABLE I COMPARISON OF OUR WORK WITH OTHER WORK IN RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS\ncontent, and all the users arrive to this central CA. In contrast, we consider a decentralized system consisting of many CAs, many multimedia sources that these CAs are connected to, and heterogeneous user arrivals to these CAs. These CAs are cooperating with each other by only knowing the connections with their own neighbors but not the entire network topology. Hence, a CA does not know which multimedia sources another CA is connected to, but it learns over time whether that CA has access to content that the users like or not. Thus, our model can be viewed as a giant collection of individual CAs that are running in parallel.\nAnother line of work [17], [18] uses social streams mined in one domain, e.g., Twitter, to build a topic space that relates these streams to content in the multimedia domain. For example, in [17], Tweet streams are used to provide video recommendations in a commercial video search engine. A content adaptation method is proposed in [7] which enables the users with different types of contexts and devices to receive content that is in a suitable format to be accessed. Video popularity prediction is studied in [18], where the goal is to predict if a video will become popular in the multimedia domain, by detecting social trends in another social media domain (such as Twitter), and transferring this knowledge to the multimedia domain. Although these methods are very different from our methods, the idea of transferring knowledge from one multimedia domain to another can be carried out by CAs specialized in specific types of cross-domain content matching For instance, one CA may transfer knowledge from tweets to predict the content which will have a high relevance/popularity for a user with a particular context, while another CA may scan through the Facebook posts of the user\u2019s friends to calculate the context of the domain in addition to the context of the user, and provide a matching according to this.\nThe advantages of our proposed approach over prior work in recommender systems are: (i) systematic analysis of recommendations\u2019 performance, including confidence bounds on the accuracy of the recommendations; (ii) no need for a priori knowledge of the users\u2019 preferences (i.e., system learns onthe-fly); (iii) achieve high accuracy even when the users\u2019 characteristics and content characteristics are changing over time; (iv) all these features are enabled in a network of distributed CAs.\nThe differences of our work from the prior work in recommender systems is summarized in Table I."}, {"heading": "B. Related Work on Multi-armed Bandits", "text": "Other than distributed content recommendation, our learning framework can be applied to any problem that can be formulated as a decentralized contextual bandit problem. Contextual\nbandits have been studied before in [10], [11], [20]\u2013[22] in a single agent setting, where the agent sequentially chooses from a set of alternatives with unknown rewards, and the rewards depend on the context information provided to the agent at each time step. In [5], a contextual bandit algorithm named LinUCB is proposed for recommending personalized news articles, which is variant of the UCB algorithm [23] designed for linear payoffs. Numerical results on real-world Internet data are provided, but no theoretical results on the resulting regret are derived. The main difference of our work from single agent contextual bandits is that: (i) a three phase learning algorithm with training, exploration and exploitation phases is needed instead of the standard two phase, i.e., exploration and exploitation phases, algorithms used in centralized contextual bandit problems; (ii) the adaptive partitions of the context space should be formed in a way that each learner/aggregator can efficiently utilize what is learned by other learners about the same context; (iii) the algorithm is robust to missing feedback (some users do not rate the content)."}, {"heading": "III. PROBLEM FORMULATION", "text": "The system model is shown in Fig. 1. There are M content aggregators (CAs) which are indexed by the set M := {1, 2, . . . ,M}. We also call each CA a learner since it needs to learn which type of content to provide to its users. Let M\u2212i :=M\u2212{i} be the set of CAs that CA i can choose from to request content. Each CA has access to the contents over its content network as shown in Fig. 1. The set of contents in CA i\u2019s content network is denoted by Ci. The set of all contents is denoted by C := \u222ai\u2208MCi. The system works in a discrete time setting t = 1, 2, . . . , T , where the following events happen sequentially, in each time slot: (i) a user with context xi(t) arrives to each CA i \u2208 M,4 (ii) based on the context of its user each CA matches its user with a content (either from its own content network or by requesting content from another CA), (iii) the user provides a feedback, denoted by yi(t), which is either like (yi(t) = 1) or dislike (yi(t) = 0).\nThe set of content matching actions of CA i is denoted by Ki := Ci \u222aM\u2212i. Let X = [0, 1]d be the context space,5 where d is the dimension of the context space. The context can include many properties of the user such as age, gender, income, previously liked content, etc. We assume that all these quantities are mapped into [0, 1]d. For instance, this mapping can be established by feature extraction methods such as the one given in [5]. Another method is to represent each property of a user by a real number between [0, 1] (e.g., normalize the age by a maximum possible age, represent gender by set {0, 1}, etc.), without feature extraction. The feedback set of a user is denoted by Y := {0, 1}. Let Cmax := maxi\u2208M |Ci|. We assume that all CAs know Cmax but they do not need to know the content networks of other CAs.\nThe following two examples demonstrate how business news aggregation and music aggregation fits our problem formulation.\n4Although in this model user arrivals are synchronous, our framework will work for asynchronous user arrivals as well.\n5In general, our results will hold for any bounded subspace of Rn.\n4 Example 1: Business news aggregation. Consider a distributed set of news aggregators that operate in different countries (for instance a European news aggregator network as in [8]). Each news aggregator\u2019s content network (as portrayed in Fig. 1 of the manuscript) consists of content producers (multimedia sources) that are located in specific regions/countries. Consider a user with context x (e.g. age, gender, nationality, profession) who subscribes to the CA A, which is located in the country where the user lives. This CA has access to content from local producers in that country but it can also request content from other CAs, located in different countries. Hence, a CA has access to (local) content generated in other countries. In such scenarios, our proposed system is able to recommend to the user subscribing to CA A also content from other CAs, by discovering the content that is most relevant to that user (based on its context x) across the entire network of CAs. For instance, for a user doing business in the transportation industry, our content aggregator system may learn to recommend road construction news, accidents or gas prices from particular regions that are on the route of the transportation network of the user.\nExample 2: Music aggregation. Consider a distributed set of music aggregators that are specialized in specific genres of music: classical, jazz, rock, rap, etc. Our proposed model allows music aggregators to share content to provide personalized recommendation for a specific user. For instance, a user that subscribes (frequents/listens) to the classical music aggregator may also like specific jazz tracks. Our proposed system is able to discover and recommend to that user also other music that it will enjoy in addition to the music available to/owned by in aggregator to which it subscribes."}, {"heading": "A. User and Content Characteristics", "text": "In this paper we consider two types of user and content characteristics. First, we consider the case when the user and content characteristics are static, i.e., they do not change over time. For this case, for a user with context x, \u03c0c(x) denotes the probability that the user will like content c. We call this the relevance score of content c.\nThe second case we consider corresponds to the scenario when the characteristics of the users and content are dynamic. For online multimedia content, especially for social media, it is known that both the user and the content characteristics are dynamic and noisy [24], hence the problem exhibits concept drift [25]. Formally, a concept is the distribution of the problem, i.e., the joint distribution of the user and content characteristics, at a certain point of time [26]. Concept drift is a change in this distribution. For the case with concept drift, we propose a learning algorithm that takes into account the speed of the drift to decide what window of past observations to use in estimating the relevance score. The proposed learning algorithm has theoretical performance guarantees in contrast to prior work on concept drift which mainly deal with the problem in a ad-hoc manner. Indeed, it is customary to assume that online content is highly dynamic. A certain type of content may become popular for a certain period of time, and then, its popularity may decrease over time and a new content may emerge as popular. In addition, although the type of the content\nremains the same, such as soccer news, its popularity may change over time due to exogenous events such as the World Cup etc. Similarly, a certain type of content may become popular for a certain type of demographics (e.g., users of a particular age, gender, profession, etc.). However, over time the interest of these users may shift to other types of content. In such cases, where the popularity of content changes over time for a user with context x, \u03c0c(x, t) denotes the probability that the user at time t will like content c.\nAs we stated earlier, a CA i can either recommend content from multimedia sources that it is directly connected to or can ask another CA for content. By asking for content c from another CA j, CA i will incur cost dij \u2265 0. For the purpose of our paper, the cost is a generic term. For instance, it can be a payment made to CA j to display it to CA i\u2019s user, or it may be associated with the advertising loss CA i incurs by directing its user to CA j\u2019s website. When the cost is payment, it can be money, tokens [27] or Bitcoins [28]. Since this cost is bounded, without loss of generality we assume that dij \u2208 [0, 1] for all i, j \u2208 M. In order make our model general, we also assume that there is a cost associated with recommending a type of content c \u2208 Ci, which is given by dic \u2208 [0, 1], for CA i. For instance, this can be a payment made to the multimedia source that owns content c.\nAn intrinsic assumption we make is that the CAs are cooperative. That is, CA j \u2208 M\u2212i will return the content that is mostly to be liked by CA i\u2019s user when asked by CA i to recommend a content. This cooperative structure can be justified as follows. Whenever a user likes the content of CA j (either its own user or user of another CA), CA j obtains a benefit. This can be either an additional payment made by CA i when the content recommended by CA j is liked by CA i\u2019s user, or it can simply be the case that whenever a content of CA j is liked by someone its popularity increases. However, we assume that the CAs\u2019 decisions do not change their pool of users. The future user arrivals to the CAs are independent of their past content matching strategies. For instance, users of a CA may have monthly or yearly subscriptions, so they will not shift from one CA to another CA when they like the content of the other CA.\nThe goal of CA i is to explore the matching actions in Ki to learn the best content for each context, while at the same time exploiting the best content for the user with context xi(t) arriving at each time instance t to maximize its total number of likes minus costs. CA i\u2019s problem can be modeled as a contextual bandit problem [10], [21], [22], [29], where likes and costs translate into rewards. In the next subsection, we formally define the benchmark solution which is computed using perfect knowledge about the probability that a content c will be liked by a user with context x (which requires complete knowledge of user and content characteristics). Then, we define the regret which is the performance loss due to uncertainty about the user and content characteristics."}, {"heading": "B. Optimal Content Matching with Complete Information", "text": "Our benchmark when evaluating the performance of the learning algorithms is the optimal solution which always recommends the content with the highest relevance score minus\ncost for CA i from the set C given context xi(t) at time t. This corresponds to selecting the best matching action in Ki given xi(t). Next, we define the expected rewards of the matching actions, and the action selection policy of the benchmark. For a matching action k \u2208 M\u2212i, its relevance score is given as \u03c0k(x) := \u03c0c\u2217k(x)(x), where c \u2217 k(x) := arg maxc\u2208Cj \u03c0c(x). For a matching action k \u2208 Ci its relevance score is equal to the relevance score of content k. The expected reward of CA i from choosing action k \u2208 Ki is given by the quasilinear utility function\n\u00b5ik(x) := \u03c0k(x)\u2212 dik (1)\nwhere dik \u2208 [0, 1] is the normalized cost of choosing action k for CA i. Our proposed system will also work for more general expected reward functions as long as the expected reward of a learner is a function of the relevance score of the chosen action and the cost (payment, communication cost, etc.) associated with choosing that action. The oracle benchmark is given by\nk\u2217i (x) := arg max k\u2208Ki \u00b5ik(x) \u2200x \u2208 X . (2)\nThe oracle benchmark depends on relevance scores as well as costs of matching content from its own content network or other CA\u2019s content network. The case dik = 0 for all k \u2208 Ki and i \u2208 M, corresponds to the scheme in which content matching has zero cost, hence k\u2217i (x) = arg maxk\u2208Ki \u03c0k(x) = arg maxc\u2208C \u03c0c(x). This corresponds to the best centralized solution, where CAs act as a single entity. On the other hand, when dik \u2265 1 for all k \u2208 M\u2212i and i \u2208 M, in the oracle benchmark a CA must not cooperate with any other CA and should only use its own content. Hence k\u2217i (x) = arg maxc\u2208Ci(\u03c0c(x) \u2212 d i c). In the following subsections, we will show that independent of the values of relevance scores and costs, our algorithms will achieve sublinear regret (in the number of users or equivalently time) with respect to the oracle benchmark."}, {"heading": "C. The Regret of Learning", "text": "In this subsection we define the regret as a performance measure of the learning algorithm used by the CAs. Simply, the regret is the loss incurred due to the unknown system dynamics. Regret of a learning algorithm which selects the matching action/arm ai(t) at time t for CA i is defined with respect to the best matching action k\u2217i (x) given in (2). Then, the regret of CA i at time T is\nRi(T ) := T\u2211 t=1 ( \u03c0k\u2217i (xi(t))(xi(t))\u2212 d i k\u2217i (xi(t)) ) \u2212 E\n[ T\u2211 t=1 ( I(yi(t) = L)\u2212 diai(t) )] .

A DISTRIBUTED ONLINE CONTENT MATCHING ALGORITHM", "text": "In this section we propose an online learning algorithm for content matching when the user and content characteristics are static. In contrast to prior online learning algorithms that exploit the context information [10], [11], [20]\u2013[22], [29], which consider a single learner setting, the proposed algorithm helps a CA to learn from the experience of other CAs. With this mechanism, a CA is able to recommend content from multimedia sources that it has no direct connection, without needing to know the IDs of such multimedia sources and their content. It learns about these multimedia sources only through the other CAs that it is connected to.\nIn order to bound the regret of this algorithm analytically we use the following assumption. When the content characteristics are static, we assume that each type of content has similar relevance scores for similar contexts; we formalize this in terms of a Lipschitz condition.\nAssumption 1: There exists L > 0, \u03b3 > 0 such that for all x, x\u2032 \u2208 X and c \u2208 C, we have |\u03c0c(x)\u2212\u03c0c(x\u2032)| \u2264 L||x\u2212x\u2032||\u03b3 .\nAssumption 1 indicates that the probability that a type c content is liked by users with similar contexts will be similar to each other. For instance, if two users have similar age, gender, etc., then it is more likely that they like the same content. We call L the similarity constant and \u03b3 the similarity exponent. These parameters will depend on the characteristics of the users and the content. We assume that \u03b3 is known by the CAs. However, an unknown \u03b3 can be estimated online using the history of likes and dislikes by users with different contexts, and our proposed algorithms can be modified to include the estimation of \u03b3.\nIn view of this assumption, the important question becomes how to learn from the past experience which content to match with the current user. We answer this question by proposing an algorithm which partitions the context space of a CA, and learns the relevance scores of different types of content for each set in the partition, based only on the past experience in that set. The algorithm is designed in a way to\n6\nachieve optimal tradeoff between the size of the partition and the past observations that can be used together to learn the relevance scores. It also includes a mechanism to help CAs learn from each other\u2019s users. We call our proposed algorithm the DIStributed COntent Matching algorithm (DISCOM), and its pseudocode is given in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.\nEach CA i has two tasks: matching content with its own users and matching content with the users of other CAs when requested by those CAs. We call the first task the maximization task (implemented by DISCOMmax given in Fig. 5), since the goal of CA i is to maximize the number of likes from its own users. The second task is called the cooperation task (implemented by DISCOMcoop given in Fig. 6), since the goal of CA i is to help other CAs obtain content from its own content network in order to maximize the likes they receive from their users. This cooperation is beneficial to CA i because of numerous reasons. Firstly, since every CA cooperates, CA i can reach a much larger set of content including the content from other CA\u2019s content networks, hence will be able to provide content with higher relevance score to its users. Secondly, when CA i helps CA j, it will observe the feedback of CA j\u2019s user for the matched content, hence will be able to update the estimated relevance score of its content, which is beneficial if a user similar to CA j\u2019s user arrives to CA i in the future. Thirdly, payment mechanisms can be incorporated to the system such that CA i gets a payment from CA j when its content is liked by CA j\u2019s user.\nIn summary, there are two types of content matching actions for a user of CA i. In the first type, the content is recommended from a source that is directly connected to CA i, while in the second type, the content is recommended from a source that CA i is connected through another CA. The information exchange between multimedia sources and CAs for these two types of actions is shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.\nLet T be the time horizon of interest (equivalent to the number of users that arrive to each CA). DISCOM creates a partition of X = [0, 1]d based on T . For instance T can be\nthe average number of visits to the CA\u2019s website in one day. Although in reality the average number of visits to different CAs can be different, our analysis of the regret in this section will hold since it is the worst-case analysis (assuming that users arrive only to CA i, while the other CAs only learn through CA i\u2019s users). Moreover, the case of heterogeneous number of visits can be easily addressed if each CA informs other CAs about its average number of visits. Then, CA i can keep M different partitions of the context space; one for itself and M \u22121 for the other CAs. If called by CA j, it will match a content to CA j\u2019s user based on the partition it keeps for CA j. Hence, we focus on the case when T is common to all CAs.\nWe first define mT as the slicing level used by DISCOM, which is an integer that is used to partition X . DISCOM forms a partition of X consisting of (mT )d sets (hypercubes) where each set is a d-dimensional hypercube with edge length 1/mT . This partition is denoted by PT . The hypercubes in PT are oriented such that one of them has a corner located at the origin of the d-dimensional Euclidian space. It is clear that the number of hypercubes is increasing in mT , while their size is decreasing in mT . When mT is small each hypercube covers a large set of contexts, hence the number of past observations that can be used to estimate relevance scores of matching actions in each set is large. However, the variation of the true relevance scores of the contexts within a hypercube increases with the size of the hypercube. DISCOM should set mT to a value that balances this tradeoff.\nA hypercube in PT is denoted by p. The hypercube in PT that contains context xi(t) is denoted by pi(t). When xi(t) is located at a boundary of multiple hypercubes in PT , it is randomly assigned to one of these hypercubes.\nDISCOMmax operates as follows. CA i matches its user at time t with a content by taking a matching action based on one of the three phases: training phase in which CA i requests content from another CA j for the purpose of helping CA j to learn the relevance score of content in its content network for users with context xi(t) (but CA i does not update the relevance score for CA j because it thinks that CA j may not know much about its own content), exploration phase in which CA i selects a matching action in Ki and updates its relevance score based on the feedback of its user, and exploitation phase in which CA i chooses the matching action with the highest relevance score minus cost.\nSince the CAs are cooperative, when another CA requests content from CA i, CA i will choose content from its content network with the highest estimated relevance score for the user of the requesting CA. To maximize the number of likes minus costs in exploitations, CA i must have an accurate estimate of the relevance scores of other CAs. This task is not trivial since CA i does not know the content network of other CAs. In order to do this, CA i should smartly select which of its users\u2019 feedbacks to use when estimating the relevance score of CA j. The feedbacks should come from previous times at which CA i has a very high confidence that the content of CA j matched with its user is the one with the highest relevance score for the context of CA i\u2019s user. Thus, the training phase of CA i helps other CAs build accurate estimates about the relevance scores\n7 DISCOM for CA i: 1: Input: H1(t), H2(t), H3(t), T , mT 2: Initialize: Partition X into hypercubes denoted by PT 3: Initialize: Set counters N ip = 0, \u2200p \u2208 PT , N ik,p = 0, \u2200k \u2208 Ki, p \u2208 PT , N tr,ij,p = 0,\u2200j \u2208M\u2212i, p \u2208 PT\n4: Initialize: Set relevance score estimates r\u0304ik,p = 0, \u2200k \u2208 Ki, p \u2208 PT 5: while t \u2265 1 do 6: Run DISCOMmax to find p = pi(t), to obtain a matching action ai, and value of train flag 7: If ai \u2208M\u2212i ask CA ai for content and pass xi(t) 8: Receive CAi(t), the set of CAs who requested content from CA i, and their contexts 9: if CAi(t) 6= \u2205 then 10: Run DISCOMcoop to obtain the content to be selected bi := {bi,j}j\u2208CAi(t) and hypercubes that the contexts of the users in CAi(t) lie in pi := {pi,j}j\u2208CAi(t) 11: end if 12: if ai \u2208 Ci then 13: Pay cost diai , obtain content ai 14: Show ai to the user, receive feedback r \u2208 {0, 1}\ndrawn from Berai(xi(t)) a\n15: else 16: Pay cost diai , obtain content bai,i from CA ai 17: Show bai,i to the user, receive feedback r \u2208 {0, 1} drawn from Berbai,i(xi(t)) 18: end if 19: if train = 1 then 20: N tr,iai,p + + 21: else 22: r\u0304iai,p = (r\u0304 i ai,pN i ai,p + r)/(N i ai,p + 1) 23: N ip + +, N iai,p + + 24: end if 25: if CAi(t) 6= \u2205 then 26: for j \u2208 CAi(t) do 27: Send content bi,j to CA j\u2019s user 28: Observe feedback r drawn from Berbi,j (xj(t)) 29: r\u0304ibi,j ,pi,j = r\u0304ibi,j ,pi,j Nibi,j ,pi,j +r\nNi bi,j ,pi,j +1\n30: N ipi,j + +, N i bi,j ,pi,j\n+ + 31: end for 32: end if 33: t = t+ 1 34: end while\naBerai (xi(t)) is the Bernoulli distribution with expected value \u03c0ai (xi(t))\nFig. 4.

In contrast, the exploration phase of CA i helps it to build accurate estimates about the relevance score of its matching actions.\nAt time t, the phase that CA i will be in is determined by the amount of time it had explored, exploited or trained for past users with contexts similar to the context of the current user. For this CA i keeps counters and control functions which are described below. Let N ip(t) be the number of user arrivals to CA i with contexts in p \u2208 PT by time t (its own arrivals and arrivals to other CAs who requested content from CA i) except the training phases of CA i.

Other than these, CA i keeps two counters for each other CA in each set in the partition, which\nDISCOMmax (maximization part of DISCOM) for CA i:\n1: train = 0 2: Find the hypercube in PT that xi(t) belongs to, i.e., pi(t) 3: Let p = pi(t) 4: Compute the set of under-explored matching actions Cuei,p(t)\ngiven in (4) 5: if Cuei,p(t) 6= \u2205 then 6: Select ai randomly from Cuei,p(t) 7: else 8: Compute the set of training candidates Mcti,p(t) given in (5) 9: //Update the counters of training candidates\n10: for j \u2208Muti,p(t) do 11: Obtain N jp from CA j, set N tr,i j,p = N j p \u2212N ij,p 12: end for 13: Compute the set of under-trained CAs Muti,p(t) given in (6) 14: Compute the set of under-explored CAs Muei,p(t) given in (7) 15: if Muti,p(t) 6= \u2205 then 16: Select ai randomly from Muti,p(t), train = 1 17: else if Muei,p(t) 6= \u2205 then 18: Select ai randomly from Muei,p(t) 19: else 20: Select ai randomly from arg maxk\u2208Ki r\u0304 i k,p \u2212 dik 21: end if 22: end if\nFig. 5.

Pseudocode for the cooperation part of DISCOM algorithm.\nit uses to decide the phase it should be in. The first one, i.e., N tr,ij,p (t), is an estimate on the number of user arrivals with contexts in p to CA j from all CAs except the training phases of CA j and exploration, exploitation phases of CA i. This counter is only updated when CA i thinks that CA j should be trained. The second one, i.e., N ij,p(t), counts the number of users of CA i with contexts in p for which content is requested from CA j at exploration and exploitation phases of CA i by time t.\nAt each time slot t, CA i first identifies pi(t). Then, it chooses its phase at time t by giving highest priority to exploration of content in its own content network, second highest priority to training of the other CAs, third highest priority to exploration of the other CAs, and lowest priority to exploitation. The reason that exploration of own content has a higher priority than training of other CAs is that it will minimize the number of times CA i will be trained by other CAs, which we describe below.\nFirst, CA i identifies the set of under-explored content in its content network:\nCuei,p(t) := {c \u2208 Ci : N ic,p(t) \u2264 H1(t)} (4)\nwhere H1(t) is a deterministic, increasing function of t which is called the control function. The value of this function will\n8 affect the regret of DISCOM. For c \u2208 Ci, the accuracy of relevance score estimates increase with H1(t), hence it should be selected to balance the tradeoff between accuracy and the number of explorations. If Cuei,p(t) is non-empty, CA i enters the exploration phase and randomly selects a content in this set to explore. Otherwise, it identifies the set of training candidates:\nMcti,p(t) := {j \u2208M\u2212i : N tr,i j,p (t) \u2264 H2(t)} (5)\nwhere H2(t) is a control function similar to H1(t). Accuracy of other CA\u2019s relevance score estimates of content in their own networks increases with H2(t), hence it should be selected to balance the possible reward gain of CA i due to this increase with the reward loss of CA i due to the number of trainings. If this set is non-empty, CA i asks the CAs j \u2208Mcti,p(t) to report N jp (t). Based in the reported values it recomputes N tr,i j,p (t) as N tr,ij,p (t) = N j p (t) \u2212 N ij,p(t). Using the updated values, CA i identifies the set of under-trained CAs:\nMuti,p(t) := {j \u2208M\u2212i : N tr,i j,p (t) \u2264 H2(t)}. (6)\nIf this set is non-empty, CA i enters the training phase and randomly selects a CA in this set to train it. WhenMcti,p(t) or Muti,p(t) is empty, this implies that there is no under-trained CA, hence CA i checks if there is an under-explored matching action. The set of CAs for which CA i does not have accurate relevance scores is given by\nMuei,p(t) := {j \u2208M\u2212i : N ij,p(t) \u2264 H3(t)} (7)\nwhere H3(t) is also a control function similar to H1(t). If this set is non-empty, CA i enters the exploration phase and randomly selects a CA in this set to request content from to explore it. Otherwise, CA i enters the exploitation phase in which it selects the matching action with the highest estimated relevance score minus cost for its user with context xi(t) \u2208 p = pi(t), i.e.,\nai(t) \u2208 arg max k\u2208Ki r\u0304ik,p(t)\u2212 dik (8)\nwhere r\u0304ik,p(t) is the sample mean estimate of the relevance score of CA i for matching action k at time t, which is computed as follows. For j \u2208 M\u2212i, let E ij,p(t) be the set of feedbacks collected by CA i at times it selected CA j while CA i\u2019s users\u2019 contexts are in set p in its exploration and exploitation phases by time t. For estimating the relevance score of contents in its own content network, CA i can also use the feedback obtained from other CAs\u2019 users at times they requested content from CA i. In order to take this into account, for c \u2208 Ci, let E ic,p(t) be the set of feedbacks observed by CA i at times it selected its content c for its own users with contexts in set p union the set of feedbacks observed by CA i when it selected its content c for the users of other CAs with contexts in set p who requests content from CA i by time t.\nTherefore, sample mean relevance score of matching action k \u2208 Ki for users with contexts in set p for CA i is defined as r\u0304ik,p(t) = (\u2211 r\u2208Eik,p(t) r ) /|E ik,p(t)|, An important observation is that computation of r\u0304ik,p(t) does not take into account the matching costs.

Of note, when there is more than one maximizer of (8), one of them is randomly selected. In order to run DISCOM, CA i does not need to keep the sets E ik,p(t) in its memory. r\u0304ik,p(t) can be computed by using only r\u0304 i k,p(t \u2212 1) and the feedback at time t. The cooperation part of DISCOM, i.e., DISCOMcoop operates as follows. Let CAi(t) be the set CAs who request content from CA i at time t. For each j \u2208 CAi(t), CA i first checks if it has any under-explored content c for pj(t), i.e., c such that N ic,pj(t)(t) \u2264 H1(t). If so, it randomly selects one of its underexplored content to match it with the user of CA j. Otherwise, it exploits its content in Ci with the highest estimated relevance score for CA j\u2019s current user\u2019s context, i.e.,\nbi,j(t) \u2208 arg max c\u2208Ci r\u0304ic,pj(t)(t). (9)\nA summary of notations used in the description of DISCOM is given in Table III. The following theorem provides a bound on the regret of DISCOM.\nTheorem 1: When DISCOM is run by all CAs with parameters H1(t) = t2\u03b3/(3\u03b3+d) log t, H2(t) = Cmaxt2\u03b3/(3\u03b3+d) log t, H3(t) = t 2\u03b3/(3\u03b3+d) log t and mT = \u2308 T 1/(3\u03b3+d) \u2309 ,6 we have\nRi(T ) \u2264 4(M + Cmax + 1)\u03b22\n+ T 2\u03b3+d 3\u03b3+d\n( 14Ld\u03b3/2 + 12 + 4(|Ci|+M)MCmax\u03b22\n(2\u03b3 + d)/(3\u03b3 + d) +2d+1Zi log T ) + T d 3\u03b3+d 2d+1(|Ci|+ 2(M \u2212 1)),\ni.e., Ri(T ) = O\u0303 ( MCmaxT 2\u03b3+d 3\u03b3+d ) ,7 where Zi = |Ci|+ (M \u2212\n6For a number r \u2208 R, let dre be the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to r.\n7O\u0303(\u00b7) is the Big-O notation in which the terms with logarithmic growth rates are hidden.\n9 1)(Cmax + 1). Proof: The proof is given Appendix B.\nFor any d > 0 and \u03b3 > 0, the regret given in Theorem 1 is sublinear in time (or number of user arrivals). This guarantees that the regret per-user, i.e., the time averaged regret, converges to 0 (limT\u2192\u221e E[Ri(T )]/T = 0). It is also observed that the regret increases in the dimension d of the context. By Assumption 1, a context is similar to another context if they are similar in each dimension, hence number of hypercubes in the partition PT increases with d.\nIn our analysis of the regret of DISCOM we assumed that T is fixed and given as an input to the algorithm. DISCOM can be made to run independently of the final time T by using a standard method called the doubling trick (see, e.g., [10]). The idea is to divide time into rounds with geometrically increasing lengths and run a new instance of DISCOM at each round. For instance, consider rounds \u03c4 \u2208 {1, 2, . . .}, where each round has length 2\u03c4 . Run a new instance of DISCOM at the beginning of each round with time parameter 2\u03c4 . This modified version will also have O\u0303 ( T (2\u03b3+d)/(3\u03b3+d) ) regret.\nMaximizing the satisfaction of an individual user is as important as maximizing the overall satisfaction of all users. The next corollary shows that by using DISCOM, CAs guarantee that their users will almost always be provided with the best content available within the entire content network.\nCorollary 1: Assume that DISCOM is run with the set of parameters given in Theorem 1. When DISCOM is in exploitation phase for CA i, we have\nP(\u00b5iai(t)(xi(t)) < \u00b5 i k\u2217i (xi(t)) (xi(t))\u2212 \u03b4T )\n\u2264 2|Ki| t2 + 2|Ki|MCmax\u03b22 t\u03b3/(3\u03b3+d) .\nwhere \u03b4T = (6Ld\u03b3/2 + 6)T\u2212\u03b3/(3\u03b3+d). Proof: The proof is given Appendix C.\nRemark 1: (Differential Services) Maximizing the performance for an individual user is particularly important for providing differential services based on the types of the users. For instance, a CA may want to provide higher quality recommendations to a subscriber (high type user) who has paid for the subscription compared to a non-subscriber (low type user). To do this, the CA can exploit the best content for the subscribed user, while perform exploration on a different user that is not subscribed."}, {"heading": "V. REGRET WHEN FEEDBACK IS MISSING", "text": "When analyzing the performance of DISCOM, we assumed that the users always provide a feedback: like or dislike. However, in most of the online content aggregation platforms user feedback is not always available. In this section we consider the effect of missing feedback on the performance of the proposed algorithm. We assume that each user gives a feedback with probability pr (which is unknown to the CAs). If the user at time t does not give feedback, we assume that DISCOM does not update its counters. This will result in a larger number of trainings and explorations compared to the case when feedback is always available. The following theorem gives an upper bound on the regret of DISCOM for this case.\nTheorem 2: Let the DISCOM algorithm run with parameters H1(t) = t2\u03b3/(3\u03b3+d) log t, H2(t) = Cmaxt2\u03b3/(3\u03b3+d) log t, H3(t) = t 2\u03b3/(3\u03b3+d) log t, and mT = \u2308 T 1/(3\u03b3+d) \u2309 .

Proof: The proof is given Appendix D.\nFrom Theorem 2, we see that missing feedback does not change the time order of the regret. However, the regret is scaled with 1/pr, which is the expected number of users required for a single feedback."}, {"heading": "VI. LEARNING UNDER DYNAMIC USER AND CONTENT CHARACTERISTICS", "text": "When the user and content characteristics change over time, the relevance score of content c for a user with context x changes over time. In this section, we assume that the following relation holds between the probabilities that a content will be liked with users with similar contexts at two different times t and t\u2032.\nAssumption 2: For each c \u2208 C, there exists L > 0, \u03b3 > 0 such that for all x, x\u2032 \u2208 X , we have\n|\u03c0c,t(x)\u2212 \u03c0c,t\u2032(x\u2032)| \u2264 L (||x\u2212 x\u2032||) \u03b3 + |t\u2212 t\u2032|/Ts\nwhere 1/Ts > 0 is the speed of the change in user and content characteristics. We call Ts the stability parameter.\nAssumption 2 captures the temporal dynamics of content matching which is absent in Assumption 1. Such temporal variations are often referred to as concept drift [30], [31]. When there is concept drift, a learner should also consider which past information to take into account when learning, in addition to how to combine the past information to learn the best matching strategy.\nThe following modification of DISCOM will deal with dynamically changing user and content characteristics by using a time window of past observations in estimating the relevance scores. The modified algorithm is called DISCOM with time window (DISCOM-W). This algorithm groups the time slots into rounds \u03b6 = 1, 2, . . . each having a fixed length of 2\u03c4h time slots, where \u03c4h is an integer called the half window length. Some of the time slots in these rounds overlap with each other as given in Fig. 7. The idea is to keep separate control functions and counters for each round, and calculate the sample mean relevance scores for groups of similar contexts based only on the observations that are made during the time window of that round. We call \u03b7 = 1 the initialization round. The control functions for the initialization round of DISCOMW is the same as the control functions H1(t), H2(t) and H3(t)\n10\nof DISCOM whose values are given in Theorem 1. For the other rounds \u03b6 > 1, the control functions depend on \u03c4h and are given as\nH\u03c4h1 (t) = H \u03c4h 3 (t) = (t mod \u03c4h + 1) z log(t mod \u03c4h + 1)\nand\nH\u03c4h2 (t) = Cmax(t mod \u03c4h + 1) z log(t mod \u03c4h + 1)\nfor some 0 < z < 1. Each round \u03b7 is divided into two subrounds. Except the initialization round, i.e., \u03b7 = 1, the first sub-round is called the passive sub-round, while the second sub-round is called the active sub-round. For the initialization round both sub-rounds are active sub-rounds. In order to reduce the number of trainings and explorations, DISCOMW has an overlapping round structure as shown in Fig. 7. For each round except the initialization round, passive subrounds of round \u03b7, overlaps with the active sub-round of round \u03b7 \u2212 1. DISCOM-W operates in the same way as DISCOM in each round. DISCOM-W can be viewed as an algorithm which generates a new instance of DISCOM at the beginning of each round, with the modified control functions. DISCOM-W runs two different instances of DISCOM at each round. One of these instances is the active instance based on which content matchings are performed, and the other one is the passive instance which learns through the content matchings made by the active instance.\nLet the instance of DISCOM that is run by DISCOM-W at round \u03b7 be DISCOM\u03b7 . The hypercubes of DISCOM\u03b7 are formed in a way similar to DISCOM\u2019s. The input time horizon is taken as Ts which is the stability parameter given in Assumption 2, and the slicing parameter mTs is set accordingly. DISCOM\u03b7 uses the partition of X into (mTs)d hypercubes denoted by PTs . When all CAs are using DISCOM-W, the matching action selection of CA i only depends on the history of content matchings and feedback observations at round \u03b7. If time t is in the active sub-round of round \u03b7, matching action of CA i \u2208M is taken according to DISCOM\u03b7 . As a result of the content matching, sample mean relevance scores and counters of both DISCOM\u03b7 and DISCOM\u03b7+1 are updated. Else if time t is in the passive sub-round of round \u03b7, matching action of CA i \u2208 M is taken according to DISCOM\u03b7\u22121 (see Fig. 7). As a result of this, sample mean relevance scores and counters of both DISCOM\u03b7\u22121 and DISCOM\u03b7 are updated.\nAt the start of a round \u03b7, the relevance score estimates and counters for DISCOM\u03b7 are equal to zero. However, due to the two sub-round structure, when the active sub-round of round \u03b7 starts, CA i already has some observations for the context and actions taken in the passive sub-round of that round, hence depending on the arrivals and actions in the passive sub-round, the CA may even start the active sub-round by exploiting, whereas it should have always spent some time in training and exploration if it starts an active sub-round without any past observations (cold start problem).\nIn this section, due to the concept drift, even though the context of a past user can be similar to the context of the current user, their relevance scores for a content c can be very different. Hence DISCOM-W assumes that a past user\nis similar to the current user only if it arrived in the current round. Since round length is fixed, it is impossible to have sublinear number of similar context observations for every t. Thus, achieving sublinear regret under concept drift is not possible. Therefore, in this section we focus on the average regret which is given by\nRavgi (T ) := 1\nT T\u2211 t=1 ( \u03c0k\u2217i (xi(t))(xi(t))\u2212 d i k\u2217i (xi(t)) ) \u2212 1 T E [ T\u2211 t=1 ( I(yi(t) = L)\u2212 diai(t) )] .\nThe following theorem bounds the average regret of DISCOM-W.\nTheorem 3: When DISCOM-W is run with parameters\nH\u03c4h1 (t) = H \u03c4h 3 (t) = (t mod \u03c4h + 1) 2\u03b3 3\u03b3+d log(t mod \u03c4h + 1) H\u03c4h2 (t) = Cmax(t mod \u03c4h + 1) 2\u03b3 3\u03b3+d log(t mod \u03c4h + 1)\nmTs = dT 1 3\u03b3+d s e and \u03c4h = bT (3\u03b3+d)/(4\u03b3+d)s c,8 where Ts is the stability parameter which is given in Assumption 2, the time averaged regret of CA i by time T is\nRavgi (T ) = O\u0303\n( T \u2212\u03b3 4\u03b3+d s ) for any T > 0. Hence DISCOM-W is = O\u0303 ( T \u2212\u03b3 4\u03b3+d s\n) approximately optimal in terms of the average reward.\nProof: The proof is given Appendix E. From the result of this theorem we see that the average regret decays as the stability parameter Ts increases. This is because, DISCOM-W will use a longer time window (round) when Ts is large, and thus can get more observations to estimate the sample mean relevance scores of the matching actions in that round, which will result in better estimates hence smaller number of suboptimal matching action selections. Moreover, the average number of trainings and explorations required decrease with the round length.\n8For a number b, bbc denotes the largest integer that is smaller than or equal to b.\n11"}, {"heading": "VII.

Hence, the only factor that affects the total reward is the users\u2019 ratings for the contents.\nYahoo! Today Module (YTM) [5]: The dataset contains news article webpage recommendations of Yahoo! Front Page. Each instance is composed of (i) ID of the recommended content, (ii) the user\u2019s context (2-dimensional vector), (iii) the user\u2019s click information. The user\u2019s click information for a webpage/content is associated with the relevance score of that content. It is equal to 1 if the user clicked on the recommended webpage and 0 else. The dataset contains T = 70000 instances and 40 different types of content. We generate 4 CAs and assign 10 of the 40 types of content to each CA\u2019s content network. Each CA has direct access to content in its own network, while it can also access to the content in other CAs\u2019 content network by requesting content from these CAs. Users are divided into four groups according to their contexts and each group is randomly assigned to one of the CAs. Hence, the user arrival processes to different CA\u2019s are different. The performance of a CA is evaluated in terms of the average number of clicks, i.e., click through rate (CTR), of the contents that are matched with its users.\nMusic Dataset (MD): The dataset contains contextual information and ratings (like/dislike) of music genres (classical, rock, pop, rap) collected from 413 students at UCLA. We generate 2 CAs each specialized in two of the four music genres. Users among the 413 users randomly arrive to each CA. A CA either recommends a music content that is in its content network or asks another CA, specialized in another music genre, to provide a music item. As a result, the rating of the user for the genre of the provided music content is revealed to the CA. The performance of a CA is evaluated in terms of the average number of likes it gets for the contents that are matched with its users.\nYahoo! Today Module (YTM) with Drift (YTMD): This dataset is generated from YTM to simulate the scenario where the user ratings for a particular content changes over time. After every 10000 instances, 20 contents are randomly selected and user clicks for these contents are set to 0 (no click) for the next 10000 instances.

In this case both algorithms always exploit for the users with high type (subscribers) and if necessary can train and explore for the users with low type (non-subscribers).

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper we considered novel online learning algorithms for content matching by a distributed set of CAs. We have characterized the relation between the user and content characteristics in terms of a relevance score, and proposed online learning algorithms that learns to match each user with the content with the highest relevance score. When the user and content characteristics are static, the best matching between content and each type of user can be learned perfectly, i.e., the average regret due to suboptimal matching goes to zero. When the user and content characteristics are dynamic, depending on the rate of the change, an approximately optimal matching between content and each user type can be learned. In addition to our theoretical results, we have validated the concept of distributed content matching on real-world datasets. An interesting future research direction is to investigate the interaction between different CAs when they compete for the same pool of users. Should a CA send a content that has a high chance of being liked by another CA\u2019s user to increase its immediate reward, or should it send a content that has a high chance of being disliked by the other CA\u2019s user to divert that user from using that CA and switch to it instead."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A BOUND ON DIVERGENT SERIES", "text": "For p > 0, p 6= 1, T\u2211 t=1 t\u2212p \u2264 1 + (T 1\u2212p \u2212 1)/(1\u2212 p).\nProof: See [32]."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX B PROOF OF THEOREM 1", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A.

The additional factor of 2 comes from the fact that the realized regret at any time slot can be at most 2.\nFor any k \u2208 Ki and p \u2208 PT , the sample mean r\u0304ik,p(t) of the relevance score of matching action k represents a random variable which is the average of the independent samples in set E ik,p(t). Since these samples are not identically distributed, in order to facilitate our analysis of the regret, we generate two different artificial i.i.d. processes to bound the probabilities related to \u00b5\u0302ik,p(t) = r\u0304 i k,p(t)\u2212 dik, k \u2208 Ki.

If a near optimal\n15\nCA j \u2208M\u2212i\u2229(Ki\u2212Lip(t)) is called by CA i at time t, and if CA j selects one of its near optimal contents in Cj\u2212Cjp(t), then the contribution to the regret is at most 2(7Ld\u03b3/2 + 6)t\u2212z/2. Moreover since we are in an exploitation step, the near-optimal CA j that is chosen can choose one of its suboptimal contents in Cjp(t) with probability at most 2Cmaxt\u22122, which will result in an expected regret of at most 4Cmaxt\u22122.\nTherefore, the total regret due to near optimal choices of CA i by time T is upper bounded by\n(14Ld\u03b3/2 + 12) T\u2211 t=1 t\u2212z/2 + 4Cmax T\u2211 t=1 t\u22122\n\u2264 (14Ld \u03b3/2 + 12)\n1\u2212 z/2 T 1\u2212z/2 + 4Cmax\u03b22.\nby using the result in Appendix A.

Since the counters of DISCOM are updated only when feedback is received, and since the control functions are the same as the ones that are used in the setting where feedback is always available, the regret due to suboptimal and near optimal matching actions by time t with missing feedback\nwill not be any greater than the regret due to suboptimal and near optimal matching actions for the case when the users always provide feedback. Therefore, the bounds given in Lemmas 2 and 3 will also hold for the case with missing feedback. Only the regret due to trainings and explorations increases, since more trainings and explorations are needed before the counters exceed the values of the control functions such that the relevance score estimates are accurate enough to exploit.

Faced with a variety of content choices, consumers are exhibiting diverse preferences for content; their preferences often depend on the context in which they consume content as well as various exogenous events. To satisfy the consumers\u2019 demand for such diverse content, multimedia content aggregators (CAs) have emerged which gather content from numerous multimedia sources. A key challenge for such systems is to accurately predict what type of content each of its consumers prefers in a certain context, and adapt these predictions to the evolving consumers\u2019 preferences, contexts and content characteristics. We propose a novel, distributed, online multimedia content aggregation framework, which gathers content generated by multiple heterogeneous producers to fulfill its consumers\u2019 demand for content. Since both the multimedia content characteristics and the consumers\u2019 preferences and contexts are unknown, the optimal content aggregation strategy is unknown a priori. Our proposed content aggregation algorithm is able to learn online what content to gather and how to match content and users by exploiting similarities between consumer types. We prove bounds for our proposed learning algorithms that guarantee both the accuracy of the predictions as well as the learning speed. Importantly, our algorithms operate efficiently even when feedback from consumers is missing or content and preferences evolve over time. Illustrative results highlight the merits of the proposed content aggregation system in a variety of settings.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
