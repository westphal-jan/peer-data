Introduction", "text": "With the wide availability of large datasets that exceed the storage capacity of single machines, distributed optimization methods for machine learning have become in-\ncreasingly important. Existing methods require significant communication between workers, frequently equaling the amount of local computation (or reading of local data). As a result, distributed machine learning suffers significantly from a communication bottleneck on real world systems, where communication is typically several orders of magnitudes slower than reading data from main memory.\nIn this work we focus on optimization problems with empirical loss minimization structure, meaning that the objective is a sum of the loss functions of each individual datapoint. This includes the most commonly used regularized variants of linear regression and classification methods. For this class of problems, the recently proposed COCOA approach (Yang, 2013; Jaggi et al., 2014; Konec\u030cny\u0301 et al., 2014) has formulated a communication efficient primaldual coordinate ascent scheme which targets the communication bottleneck, by allowing more computation to be performed on data local subproblems on each machine before a single vector is communicated. By appropriately choosing the amount of local computation per round, this framework allows one to control the trade-off between communication and local computation based on the systems hardware at hand.\nHowever, the performance of COCOA (as well as the related primal SGD based methods) is slowed down significantly by the need to average updates between all machines. As the number of machines K grows, the updates get diluted and slowed down by 1/K, e.g. in the case\nar X\niv :1\n50 2.\n03 50\n8v 1\n[ cs\nwhere all machines except one would already have reached the solutions of their respective partial optimization tasks. A somewhat opposite problem appears if the updates are added instead, as the algorithms can then diverge, as we will observe in the practical experiments below.\nTo address both described issues, in this paper we develop a novel generalization of the local COCOA subproblems assigned to each worker, making the framework more powerful in the following sense: Without extra computational cost, the set of locally computed updates from the modified subproblems (one from each machine) can be combined much more efficiently between the machines. The COCOA+ updates proposed here can be aggressively added (hence the \u2018+\u2019-suffix), which gives a much faster convergence both in practice and also in theory. We will see that the difference is particularly significant as the number of machines K becomes large."}, {"heading": "1.1. Contributions", "text": "Strong Scaling. To our knowledge, our distributed optimization framework is the first to exhibit favorable strong scaling for the class of problems considered when the number of machines K increases, while the data size is kept fixed. More precisely, while the convergence rate of COCOA degrades as the number of workers K is increased, the stronger theoretical convergence rate here is \u2013 in the worst case \u2013 independent of K. Our practical experiments in Section 7 confirm the improved speed of convergence. Since the number of communicated vectors is only one per round and worker, this favorable scaling might be surprising. Indeed, for existing methods, splitting data among more machines generally increases the requirements for communication (Shamir & Srebro, 2014), which often has severe effects on overall runtime.\nTheoretical Analysis for Non-Smooth Functions. While the existing analysis for COCOA in (Jaggi et al., 2014) only covered smooth loss functions, here we extend the class of functions where the rates apply (to include e.g. Support Vector Machines and non-smooth regression variants). We provide a primal-dual convergence rate for both COCOA as well as our new method COCOA+ in the case of general convex (L-Lipschitz) losses.\nPrimal-Dual Convergence Rate. Furthermore, we additionally strengthen the rates by showing stronger primaldual convergence for both algorithmic frameworks, which are almost tight to their objective-only counterparts. Primal-dual rates for COCOA had not previously been analyzed in the general convex case. Our primal-dual rates allow efficient and practical certificates for the optimization quality, e.g. for stopping criterions. The new rates apply for both smooth and non-smooth, and for both COCOA as\nwell as the extended COCOA+.\nExperimental Results. We provide a thorough experimental comparison with competing algorithms, which we all implement in Spark. Our practical results confirm the strong scaling of COCOA+ as the number of machines K grows up to 100, while competing methods \u2013 including original COCOA \u2013 are slowing down significantly with larger K."}, {"heading": "1.2.

The constant \u03bb > 0 is the regularization parameter.\nThe above class of problems includes many standard problems of wide interest in machine learning, statistics and signal processing, including Support Vector Machines, as well as regularized linear and logistic regression, ordinal regression, and others.\nDual Problem, and Primal-Dual Certificates.

See e.g. (Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013c) for several concrete applications.\nIt is possible assign for any dual vector \u03b1 \u2208 Rn a corresponding primal feasible point\nw(\u03b1) = 1\u03bbnA\u03b1. (3)\nThe duality gap function is given as follows\nG(\u03b1) := P(w(\u03b1))\u2212D(\u03b1). (4)\nBy weak duality, every value D(\u03b1) at a dual candidate \u03b1 provides a lower bound for every primal value P (w), therefore the duality gap being a certificate for the approximation quality: The unknown true optimum P (w\u2217) must always lie within the duality gap, i.e. G(\u03b1) = P(w) \u2212 D(\u03b1) \u2265 P(w)\u2212 P(w\u2217) \u2265 0.\nIn large-scale machine learning such as in the setting here, the availability of such a computable measure of approximation quality is a crucial benefit for training methods. In contrast, practitioners using classical primal-only methods such as SGD have no means by which to accurately detect if a model has been well trained, as P (w\u2217) is unknown.\nClasses of Loss-Functions.

From the above worst-case upper bound, we note that the cost can increase with \u03c3\u2032, as aggregation becomes more aggressive.

Discussion and Related Work", "text": "SGD-based Algorithms. For the empirical loss minimization problems of interest here, stochastic subgradient descent (SGD) based methods are well-established. Several distributed variants of SGD have been proposed (Niu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014; Duchi et al., 2013). Most of these build on the idea of a parameter-server, receiving all SGD updates performed by each local worker. The downside of this approach is that the amount of required communication is equal to the amount of data read locally (as in mini-batch SGD with a batch size of 1 per worker). Being tailored for very sparse problems, such SGD variants are in practice not competitive with the more communication efficient methods considered here, which allow more local updates per round.\nOne-Shot Communication Schemes. At the other extreme of the spectrum, we find the group of distributed methods only using a single round of communication such as (Zhang et al., 2013; Zinkevich et al., 2010; Mann et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013; McWilliams et al., 2014). These do require additional assumptions on the partitioning of\nthe data, and furthermore can not guarantee convergence to the optimum solution for all regularizers, as shown e.g. in (Shamir et al., 2014b). (Balcan et al., 2012) shows additional relevant lower bounds on the minimum number of communication rounds necessary for a given approximation quality for similar machine learning problems.\nMethods Allowing Local Optimization. It is apparent that the well performing methods must lie in the middle of the two extremes of the communication vs computation tradeoff. Therefore, we need to design more meaningful data-local subproblems to be solved per round of communication. In this spirit, (Shamir et al., 2014b; Zhang & Xiao, 2015) have proposed distributed Newton-type algorithms. In this approach, the subproblems have to be solved to very high accuracy for the convergence rate to hold, which is often prohibitive as the size of the data on one machine is still relative large.\nThe COCOA framework (Jaggi et al., 2014) allows using local solvers of weak local approximation quality in each round, while still giving a convergence rate for smooth losses. By making use of the primal-dual structure in the line of work of (Yu et al., 2012; Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013c; Yang, 2013; Yang et al., 2013; Jaggi et al., 2014), the COCOA framework as well as the extension here allow to have more control over the meaningful aggregation of updates between different machines.\nMini-Batch Methods. Mini-batch versions of both SGD and coordinate descent (CD) (Richta\u0301rik & Taka\u0301c\u030c, 2013b;a; Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013b; Yang, 2013; Qu & Richta\u0301rik, 2014; Qu et al., 2014) suffer from their convergence rate degrading towards the rate of batch gradient descent, as the size of the mini-batch is increased. This follows because the updates from all datapoints in the minibatch are based on the previous parameter vector w, contrasting methods that allow local updates such as COCOA or local-SGD (Jaggi et al., 2014). Furthermore, the aggregation parameter for mini-batch methods is harder to tune, as it can lie anywhere in the order of mini-batch size, being usually in the thousands in practice. The mini-batch size must be chosen by the tradeoff of cost of a communication round vs. local reading of a vector. In the COCOA setting, the aggregation parameter is slightly easier to tune, as it is in the smaller range given by number of machines. In our COCOA+ extension presented below, we show that we can get rid of tuning the aggregation parameter completely, by simply allowing additive aggregation.\nADMM. An alternative approach to distributed problems of our form of interest is to use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), as used for distributed SVM training e.g. in (Forero et al., 2010). This uses a penalty parameter balancing between the equality con-"}, {"heading": "Dataset n d Sparsity", "text": "straint w and the optimization objective (Boyd et al., 2011). However, the known convergence rates for ADMM are weaker than the more problem tailored methods mentioned previously, and also the choice of the penalty parameter is often unclear."}, {"heading": "7.

We show that COCOA+ converges to the optimal solution faster in terms of total rounds as well as elapsed time as compared to COCOA in all cases, despite varying: the dataset, values of regularization, batch size, and cluster size (Section 7.2). In Section 7.3 we demonstrate that this performance translates to orders of magnitude improvement in convergence when scaling up the number of machines K, as compared to COCOA as well as to several other state-of-the-art methods. Finally, in Section 7.4 we investigate the impact of the subproblem parameter \u03c3\u2032 in the COCOA+ framework."}, {"heading": "7.1.

Comparison of COCOA+ and COCOA", "text": "We compare the COCOA+ and COCOA frameworks directly using two datasets (Covertype and RCV1) across various values of \u03bb, the regularizer, in Figure 1.

For all runs of COCOA+ we use the safe upper bound of \u03b3K for \u03c3\u2032. In terms of both the total number of communications made and the elapsed time, COCOA+ (shown in blue) converges to the optimal solution faster than COCOA (red). The discrepancy is larger for greater values of \u03bb, where the strongly convex regularizer has more of an impact and the problem difficulty is reduced. We also see a greater performance gap for smaller\nvalues of H , where there is frequent communication between the machines and the master, and changes between the algorithms therefore play a larger role."}, {"heading": "7.3.

For \u03b3 = 1 (the most aggressive variant of COCOA+ in which updates are added) we consider several different values of \u03c3\u2032, ranging from \u03c3\u2032=1 to \u03c3\u2032=8. The value \u03c3\u2032=8 represents the safe upper bound of \u03b3K. We see that the optimal convergence occurs around \u03c3\u2032=4, and diverges for \u03c3\u2032 \u2264 2.

The proof is based on techniques developed in recent coordinate descent papers, including (Richta\u0301rik & Taka\u0301c\u030c, 2014; 2013b; 2012; Tappenden et al., 2015; Marec\u030cek et al., 2014; Fercoq & Richta\u0301rik, 2013; Lu & Xiao, 2013; Fercoq et al., 2014; Qu & Richta\u0301rik, 2014; Qu et al., 2014) (Efficient accelerated variants were considered in (Fercoq & Richta\u0301rik, 2013; Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013a)).\nFirst, let us define the function F (\u03b6) : Rnk \u2192 R as F (\u03b6) := \u2212G\u03c3\u2032k ( \u2211 i\u2208Pk \u03b6iei, w). This function can be written in two\nparts F (\u03b6) = \u03a6(\u03b6) + f(\u03b6). The first part denoted by \u03a6(\u03b6) = 1n \u2211 i\u2208Pk ` \u2217 i (\u2212\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b6i) is strongly convex with convexity parameter \u00b5n with respect to the standard Euclidean norm. In our application, we think of the \u03b6 variable collecting the local dual variables \u2206\u03b1[k].\nThe second part we will denote by f(\u03b6) = 1K \u03bb 2 \u2016w(\u03b1)\u2016 2 + 1n \u2211 i\u2208Pk w(\u03b1) Txi\u03b6i + \u03bb 2\u03c3 \u2032 1 \u03bb2n2 \u2016 \u2211 i\u2208Pk xi\u03b6i\u2016\n2.

Reducing communication makes the efficient aggregation of partial work from different machines more challenging. In this paper we present a novel generalization of the recent communication efficient primal-dual coordinate ascent framework (COCOA). Our framework, COCOA+, allows for additive combination of local updates to the global parameters at each iteration, whereas previous schemes only allowed conservative averaging. We give stronger (primal-dual) convergence rate guarantees for both COCOA as well as our new variants, and generalize the theory for both methods to also cover non-smooth convex loss functions. We provide an extensive experimental comparison on several real-world distributed datasets, showing markedly improved performance, especially when scaling up the number of machines.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
