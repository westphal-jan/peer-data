INTRODUCTION\nIn last few decades, the availability of massive amounts of data in electronic form and significant advances in computational power have given rise to the development of disciplines of Data Mining and Mathematical Programming that is at the centre of modern Scientific and Engineering computation. Two central problems in this direction are data classification and regression. The present focus entails a study of the regression problem. Some of the popular methods for these problems include Decision Trees for classification and regression like CART, C5.0, CRUISE [2], [5], [8], [9], Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) [6] and Support Vector Machines (SVM) [9], [11], [14]. Decision Trees and MARS are heuristic in nature and are closer to statistical inference methods. SVM belongs to the category of separating hyper planes and utilize formal continuous optimization technique like quadratic optimization. These methods are at forefront of Data Mining and have significant impact in practical applications. While Continuous Optimization methods have been widely used in Statistics and have significant impact in last 30 years [1], Integer Optimization has limited impact in Statistical Computing. While statisticians have recognized that problems like classification and regression\ncan be formulated as Integer Optimization problems [1], the belief was formed in early 1970s that these methods are not tractable in practical computational settings. Due to the success of above methods belief of Integer Optimization\u2019s impracticality, the applicability of Integer Optimization methods to problems of classification and regression has not been investigated.\nBesides this, huge real life data is characterized by an inherent degree of uncertainty and vagueness features. In order to tackle this impreciseness in large data volume Fuzzy Sets serve as an effective tool. Fuzzy theory was originally developed by Zadeh [15] to deal with problems involving linguistic terms [16], [17], [18] and have been successfully applied to various applications in Engineering and Science. It generalizes classical two-valued logic to multi-valued logic for reasoning under uncertainty. Further it is a model-less approach and is clever disguise of Probability Theory. In this Paper, we develop a methodology for regression viz. Fuzzy Mixed Integer Optimization Model (FMIOM) that utilizes Integer Optimization methods using Fuzzy Sets to exploit discrete character of these problems. Due to the significant advances in Integer Optimization in recent past it is possible to solve large scale problems within practical limits. The methodology incorporates clustering to reduce dimensionality, non\u2013linear transformations to improve predictive power, Mixed Integer Optimization to group points together and eliminate outlier data to represent groups by polyhedral regions. The data points are separated into different polyhedral regions and each region has its own distinct regression coefficients. In this attempt, we have drawn the attention of Statistics and Data Mining community that Integer Optimization can be significantly used to revisit different Statistical problems. This Paper is organized as follows. In section II, the geometry of regression approach is illustrated. This is followed by FMIOM for regression in the next section. Computational results and discussions are presented in section IV. Finally, in section V conclusions are given."}, {"heading": "II.

In addition, optimization model is further enhanced to detect and eliminate outlier points in data set (Figure 2). In contrast, traditional regression models deal with outliers after slopes have been determined by examining which points contribute most to total prediction error [12], [13]. This procedure can often be deceiving because the model is heavily influenced by\noutlier points.

COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS", "text": "In this section, we discuss the performance of FMIOM on three real data sets viz. Boston, Abalone and Auto data and Friedman\u2019s [7] generated data sets. A comparison is also made on performances of Linear Least Square Regression (LLSR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) and generalized regression using MATLAB\u2019s ANN Toolbox. Each regression data was split into three parts with 50%, 30% and 20% of data used for training, validation and testing respectively. The assignment to each set was done randomly and the process was repeated 10 times. The validation set was used to fine tune value of parameter K . In all cases, the FMIOM depicted in Equation (17) was solved and parameters LM , and \u03c1~ were set to 10000, 10 and 0.01 respectively.\nIn ANN, validation set was used to select the appropriate model viz. RBF against generalized regression, adjust number of epochs, number of layers, spread constant and accuracy parameter.\nTables I and II illustrate mean absolute error and mean squared error respectively of LLSR, ANN and FMIOM averaged over 10 random partitions on Friedman\u2019s data\nsets. Tables III and IV illustrate mean absolute error and mean squared error respectively of regression methods averaged over 10 random partitions on Boston, Abalone and Auto data sets. The numbers in parenthesis are corresponding standard deviations. Tables V and VI illustrate average running time in CPU seconds of the methods for Friedman\u2019s generated data sets and real data sets respectively. We measure the performance of different regression methods by their predictive ability and stability of their solutions. The prediction accuracy are measured using both mean absolute errors and mean squared errors between predicted against the actual response variable in testing set, given that mean absolute error is used as goodness of fit criterion for FMIOM and mean squared error is used as goodness of fit criterion for LLSR and ANN model. FMIOM used 2=K for all data sets, ANN always used RBF as preferred model with just one layer of nodes. Table 6 shows that FMIOM has relatively reasonable average running time as other methods for small data sets, but its run time explodes for larger Abalone data set. There exists a dramatic increase in run time with larger\ndata sets mainly due to M parameter in models (1) and (3). Because tight estimate of Mbig \u2212 parameter cannot be\ndetermined apriori, the large value of M seriously hampers the efficiency of FMIOM.\nThe computational experiments illustrated some benefits and shortcomings of FMIOM compared to other existing methods in Data Mining and Machine Learning. The results obtained from FMIOM can be improved further by enforcing continuity in boundaries, finding stronger\napproximations of parameter M and making more computational runs. Its main weakness arises from discontinuity of regression line at boundaries of polyhedral regions. FMIOM predictive performance of general continuous function is significantly hampered as evident with Friedman data set. Continuity can be imposed by modifications to the FMIOM in one dimensional case, but extension to higher dimensions is not evident with current model. Thus, as it currently stands if underlying function is continuous, perhaps a continuous model would be more appropriate. Another apparent challenge for FMIOM is maintaining reasonable computation time. Compared to heuristic based methods in Data Mining such as ANN and Classification Trees, FMIOM has much longer running time for larger data sets. However, FMIOM did have faster\nrunning times compared to other techniques like SVM in certain problems. The implementation of FMIOM can be improved to speed up its running time. It can implement a tailored quadratic programming solver for solving SVM sub-problems as done in all implementations of SVM. The FMIOM for regression can be tailored by implicitly branching on integer variables [3]. Such an implementation will also eliminate the need for Mbig \u2212 constraints in\nOptimization Problems (1) and (3) that can significantly hamper computation time of Integer Programming problems. In addition, because provably optimal solution is not critical in this context, we can prematurely terminate branch and bound procedure at 5% and 10% relative optimality gap or by time limit. However, even with all these improvements, FMIOM does not have superior performance over methods like Classification Trees with respect to time. This method would be appropriate for those who value prediction accuracy over computation time, which might be in areas of Medical and Genetic research. Third shortcoming of FMIOM is its lack of interpretability such as ANOVA interpretation. This weakness is shared by ANN and SVM. Unfortunately, not much can be done to improve this problem for FMIOM. Thus, if decision rules or variable importance information are vital to Data Mining application, tools such as Classification Trees would be more suitable. FMIOM may find similar audience that might find its classification accuracy more valuable. Also, FMIOM is able to handle categorical variables like SVM which might be an additional benefit in certain applications."}, {"heading": "V.

It has been used to solve Statistical problems of classification and regression involving massive data. However, there is an inherent degree of vagueness present in huge real life data. This impreciseness is handled by Fuzzy Sets. In this Paper, Fuzzy Mixed Integer Optimization Method (FMIOM) is used to find solution to Regression problem. The methodology exploits discrete character of problem. In this way large scale problems are solved within practical limits. The data points are separated into different polyhedral regions and each region has its own distinct regression coefficients. In this attempt, an attention is drawn to Statistics and Data Mining community that Integer Optimization can be significantly used to revisit different Statistical problems. Computational experimentations with generated and real data sets show that FMIOM is comparable to and often outperforms current leading methods. The results illustrate potential for significant impact of Fuzzy Integer Optimization methods on Computational Statistics and Data Mining.
