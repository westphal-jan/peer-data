Ontological concept similarity can be based on different approaches: (i) string matching of concept labels (i.e. lexical similarity) [Stoilos et al., 2005], (ii) external lexical resource/ontology based matching (i.e. lexico-semantic similarity) [Rada et al., 1989a], (iii) graph-based matching using lexicons such as WordNet [Stuckenschmidt, 2007] (i.e. structural similarity), (iv) property analysis (as in FCA-based similarity [Cimiano et al., 2005]) or instance analysis (as in Jaccard similarity [Jaccard, 1998]) based matching over a large sample of concept instance occurrences (i.e. instance-driven similarity), (v) matching based on statistical analysis of attribute-value or distribution analysis within fixed context-windows of concepts over large corpora (i.e. statistical similarity) [Li and Clifton, 1994], and (vi) model-theoretic matching of formal concept descriptions (i.e. formal semantic similarity) [Alsubait et al., 2014].\nIt can be argued that, in comparison to other approaches, formal semantic similarity measure modeling has not received equal research attention. Nevertheless, existing literature is significant, and can be broadly classified into two approaches: (i) Propositional Logics based [Nienhuys-Cheng, 1998; Ramon and Bruynooghe, 1998], and (ii) Description Logics (DL) based [Alsubait et al., 2014; Lehmann and Turhan, 2012; Stuckenschmidt, 2007; Fanizzi and dAmato,\n2006; Borgida et al., 2005]. The former requires: (a) representation of ontologies (mostly in RDFS/OWL format) in First Order Predicate Logic, (b) a set of axioms (or domain knowledge, mostly as upper ontologies/thesaurus), and (c) a SAT solver that checks satisfiability (and hence, satisfiability) of disjointness of concept pairs. The latter approach, on the other hand, does not necessarily require any formal language transformation or satisfiability checker. In this paper we propose an algebraic similarity measure, called BitSim (\u03c3BS), that can compute semantic similarity of pair of concepts defined in ALCH+1. The motivation behind \u03c3BS is to formulate a formal semantic similarity measure that provides: (i) a platform for fast, scalable, and accurate semantic similarity computation of DL concepts, and (ii) a sound and complete correspondence with conventional semantic interpretation of DL. \u03c3BS is algebraic, in the sense that it maps a given pair of concept codes (called bit-code), instead of concept DL definitions/axioms, to a positive real space. For this we define a novel algebraic interpretation function, called IB, that maps an ALCH+ definition to a unique string, called bit-code, (\u03c9B) belonging to the language LB defined over a novel algebraic alphabet \u2211 B. We prove that IB has complete correspondence with IALCH+. We also show that \u03c3BS is highly adaptive to any kind of similarity measure that relies on set operation. As an example, we have shown how \u03c3BS can be plugged into Jaccard similarity index. The contribution of the paper is as follows: \u2022 IB : A novel algebraic semantic interpretation function\nforALCH+ . \u2022 Proof of mathematical correspondence of IB with se-\nmantic interpretation ofALCH+ . \u2022 \u03c3BS : A novel semantic similarity measure based on IB \u2022 Comparative analysis of properties of \u03c3BS with contem-\nporary DL based similarity measures."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "DL based similarity measures, as described in the introduction, can be further sub-divided into: (i) taxonomic analysis, (ii) structural analysis [Tongphu and Suntisrivaraporn, 2014; Ontan\u0303o\u0301n and Plaza, 2012; Joslyn et al., 2008; Hariri et al., 2006], (iii) language approximation [Stuckenschmidt, 2007;\n1ALCH+ : ALCH \u222a {RUNION ,RINTERSECTION }\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n05 66\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 9\nM ar\n2 01\n5\nTserendorj et al., 2008; Groot et al., 2005; Brandt et al., 2002], and (iii) model-theoretic analysis [Distel et al., 2014; Alsubait et al., 2014; Lehmann and Turhan, 2012; Borgida et al., 2005]. The most common approach for DL based similarity measure modeling adopts taxonomic analysis as proposed in [Rada et al., 1989b; Resnik and others, 1999; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Wu and Palmer, 1994; Lin, 1998]. These techniques can be further sub-divided, as mentioned in introduction, into graph-traversal approaches [Rada et al., 1989b] and Information-Content approaches [Resnik and others, 1999]. However, these methods can work on a generalized ontology and hence, are not sensitive to DL definitions.\nIn structural analysis based approaches, a similarity measure is designed to capture the semantic equivalence of description trees of definitions of DL concept pairs. One way of achieving this is to calculate the degree of homomorphism between such trees, as proposed in [Tongphu and Suntisrivaraporn, 2014]. A refinement graph based anti-unification approach has been proposed in [Ontan\u0303o\u0301n and Plaza, 2012] for computing instance similarity. Approximation based techniques aim at converting given DL expression to another lower expressive DL language on approximation. In [Stuckenschmidt, 2007] an upper and lower approximation interpretation for SHIQ have been defined over a sub-vocabulary of SHIQ. The sub-vocabulary can be formed by either removing concepts atoms in a given definition or by replacing them with structurally simpler concepts [Groot et al., 2005]. Another technique, as proposed in [Noia et al., 2004], is based on converting user query into a DL expression and try to classify the match to be either an exact match, or a potential match (i.e., match might happen if some concept atom and operators are added) or a partial match (where the user query and answer/description found in the knowledge base are in conflict).\nOne of the pioneer work on model-theoretic interpretation based similarity approach can be found in [Borgida et al., 2005]. The work shows the inherent difficulty in measuring similarity of DL concepts using conventional taxonomic analysis based techniques. It then uses an InformationContent based approach to evaluate the similarity of two concept definitions. A work has been proposed by [Lehmann and Turhan, 2012] for similarity computation of concepts defined in ELH . In this work, a Jaccard Index [Jaccard, 1998] based approach has been followed that compares common parents of a concept pair using a fuzzy connector (i.e. a similarity score aggregation function). A similar Jaccard Index based approach has been recently proposed in [Alsubait et al., 2014]. Another recent approach has been proposed in [Distel et al., 2014]. The work emphasizes the necessity of triangle inequality property of formal semantic similarity measure. It defines two versions of a relaxation function for computing dissimilarity of concepts defined in EL. However, it can be proved that triangle inequality is not always valid and hence, is not a necessary condition."}, {"heading": "3 Preliminaries", "text": "3.1 ALCH+ - A Description Logics Fragment We hereby define the semantic interpretation ofALCH+ (an extension of which also interprets current OWL 2 specification)2.

We first define bit (\u03a3B), the alphabet of LB , as follows:\nDefinition 2: A base alphabet (\u03a3Bbase ) is an alphabet defined as: \u03a3Bbase = {0, 1} where \u2022 0 is the empty symbol. It is also called potential bit since\nit generates all other symbols (i.e. bits) \u2022 1 is base bit, called property bit, signifying the presence\nof a property at the string position that it holds. Definition 3: An bit operator (\u2295B) is a set of operators on the base bits defined as: \u2295B = {tB,uB,\u00acB}. We now define a very important semantics for potential bit (i.e. 0) as follows:\n\u00acB0 = 0 (1) Definition 4: An derived alphabet (\u03a3Bderived ) is an alphabet\ndefined as: \u03a3Bderived = {X, X\u2032\u2032, X\u2032,Y,Y \u2032,>\u2032,\u22a5\u2032,>,\u22a5} where\n\u2022 X\u2032\u2032 = \u00acB1 \u2022 X = 1 tB 0 \u2022 X\u2032 = X\u2032\u2032 tB 0 \u2022 >\u2032 = Y tB Y \u2032 \u2022 Y \u2032 = 1 uB 0 \u2022 Y = X\u2032\u2032 uB 0 \u2022 \u22a5\u2032 = X uB X\u2032 Based on the above definition the following observations\ncan be made (using de Morgan\u2019s law): \u2022 X = \u00acBY \u2022 X\u2032 = \u00acBY \u2032\n\u2022 >\u2032 = \u00acB\u22a5\u2032\n\u2022 > = \u00acB\u22a5 A further analysis shows that \u03a3Bhas a partial ordering 4B (as shown in figure 1). It is interesting to note that bi uB \u00acbi , \u22a5;\u2200bi \u2208 \u03a3B. Definition 5.1: An bit-alphabet (\u03a3B) is defined as \u03a3B: \u03a3Bbase \u222a \u03a3Bderived .\nIt is to be noted that \u2295B satisfies commutativity and double negation over \u03a3B.\nDefinition 5.2: A quantifier-alphabet (\u03a3BQ ) is defined as \u03a3BQ = {1, 0, X,Y \u2032}. The algebraic space of \u03a3BQ is defined as below: \u2022 X = 1 tB 0 \u2022 Y \u2032 = 1 uB 0 \u2022 \u00acB1 = 0 \u2022 \u00acBY \u2032 = X\nDefinition 5.3: A role-alphabet (\u03a3BR ) is defined as \u03a3BR = {1, 0, X,Y \u2032}.

We leave the explanation and utility of the definition in section 5.3.

Unlike other DL based similarity measures, \u03c3BS was designed to satisfy all the necessary properties defined in section 3.2 with special emphasis on structural dependency and strict monotonicity.\nAt the same time, \u03c3BS computation is over LB , rather than ALCH+ . This significantly improves the computational speed since \u03c3BS essentially becomes a function over \u03c9B pairs (such bit-codes can be computed and stored off-line in the knowledge base). Since, \u03c3BS computation is performed on pairs of bits holding the same position in \u03c9B , therefore we can chunk bit-codes in constant sizes and perform similarity over concept pairs on parallel computational platforms. This gives massive scalability to \u03c3BS . Efficient optimization can be performed by caching similarity results of bit-code chunks that are frequently visited.\nWe will also show that, at a bit level, \u03c3BS has a partial ordering 4\u03c3BS . This allows application-oriented assignment of similarity scores to bit pairs at the lowest granularity. Also, \u03c3BS is highly adaptive to all types of similarity measures that have set theoretic operations on DL concepts."}, {"heading": "5.2 Encoding Atomic Concepts", "text": "Before we show that LB has complete correspondence with ALCH+ , we first provide the foundational axioms that helps us to encode atomic concepts inALCH+ .

In the second axiom b Ai k holds the significant property bit. We now show the method to encode inclusion axioms on atomic concepts using the following two axioms:\nAxiom of Property Bit Inheritance \u2200Ai, A j \u2208 TALCH+, Ai v A j, bA jk = 1\u2192 b Ai k = 1;\u2200b A j k \u2208 \u03c9 A j B\n(3)\nAxiom of Atomic Bit-Code Uniqueness Given,\u2200Ai, A j \u2208 TALCH+, A j @ Ai \u2203bAik \u2208 \u03c9 Ai B , b A j k \u2208 \u03c9 A j B , b i k = 1 & b j k , 1\n(4)\nThe above four axioms ensure that a simple boolean intersection between any pair of \u03c9AiB and \u03c9 A j B generates the bitcode of the least common subsumer (lcs) atomic concept. An example encoding instance has been illustrated in figure 2. For atomic roles we can use the same principle of encoding with an alphabet \u03a3RBbase that corresponds to \u03a3Bbase ."}, {"heading": "5.3 Encoding Derived Concepts", "text": "For encoding derived concepts, we cannot attain completeness using \u03c9Bbase only. This is because, for a bounded number of atomic concepts (say, n) we need a mechanism to encode 22 n distinct and disjoint concepts, in the worst case. However, with only 11 bits in \u03a3B, we can only encode 11n distinct concepts. It is because of this reason that we need to use \u03c9Bderived . The method is to have nested encoding for bit operations over certain special bit pairs. These operations do not have direct mapping to the algebraic lattice shown in figure 1. Instead they map to intermediate and discrete compound bits (b\u03c9). which can be represented in terms of \u03a3B.

The proof follows from theorem 1 - 3."}, {"heading": "6 BitSim Similarity Measure", "text": ""}, {"heading": "6.1 Outline", "text": "In this section we provide a generic definition for BitSim. We first define \u03c3BS (i.e. similarity at a bit level) as follows:\nDefinition 10: \u03c3BS : bi \u00d7 b j 7\u2192 [0, 1]; where bi, b j \u2208 \u03a3B. It is to be noted that bi can be b\u03c9 as well. One can see that \u03c3BS has a total order 4\u03c3BS (see figure 4). In order to compute similarity at a bit-code level, we define an aggregation function called \u03c3\u0302BS. There are two parameters that should influence the value output of \u03c3\u0302BS: (i) 4B and (ii) code-generativity (CG). We define code-generativity as follows:\nDefinition 11: Code-generativity (FCG) of any\u03c9B of a concept is the total number of distinct and disjoint concepts that are covered by the \u03c9B .\nAs an example, FCG(XX1) = 3; (i.e. 11\u20321, 1\u203211, 111). We now define the similarity measure at a bit-code level (we call it \u03c3\u0302BS) as follows:\nDefinition 12: \u03c3\u0302BS: {\u03c3BS k \u00d7 (FCG)k \u00d7 4Bk} 7\u2192 [0, 1].\nWe now postulate the following axioms:\nAxiom of 0-bit Similarity \u2200k;\u03c3BS (0k, 0k) is ignored.\n(10)\nAxiom of > \u2212 bit Similarity \u2200a \u2208 \u03a3B;\u03c3BS (>, a) = 1 i f a = >; else unde f ined.\n(11)\nAxiom of \u22a5 \u2212 bit Similarity \u2200a \u2208 \u03a3B;\u03c3BS (\u22a5, a) = 1 i f a = \u22a5; else unde f ined.\n(12)"}, {"heading": "6.2 \u03c3\u0302BS: Property Analysis", "text": "In this section we show that \u03c3\u0302BS follows the necessary conditions: (i) reflexive, (ii) maximality, (iii) equivalence closure, (iv) equivalence invariance, (v) structural dependency, (vi) subsumption preservation, (vii) reverse subsumption preservation, and (viii) strict monotonicity. The first two properties trivially hold true. The following theorems show that the rest of the properties hold:\nTheorem 6. Equivalence closure and invariance holds true for \u03c3\u0302BS.\nProof. Follows from theorem 1 and theorem 4.\nTheorem 7. Structural dependency holds true for \u03c3\u0302BS.\nProof. Under the condition of structural dependency, for two concepts Ci and C j the \u03c9B that is generated for them will have a length, say l, that grows exponentially as the number of inner intersections in the definition of both Ci and C j tends to \u221e. Therefore, except for the word length of the invariant concepts in the definition of Ci and C j, all of \u03c9B Ci and \u03c9B C j will be exact. Hence, \u03c3\u0302BS(Ci,C j)\u2192 1\nTheorem 8. Strict monotonicity holds true for \u03c3\u0302BS.\nProof. When more than one concepts (say, Cx,Cy) subsume two (say, Ci,C j) out of three arbitrary concepts (say, Ci,C j,Ck), while only one (say, Cy) subsumes all three, then \u03c3\u0302BS(Ci,C j) > \u03c3\u0302BS(Ci,Ck). This is because, since \u03c3\u0302BS is property based measure, Ci,C j will inherit more common bits than Ck.\nWe now show how \u03c3\u0302BScan be adapted to a third-party similarity measure as follows:\nDefinition 13: \u03c3\u0302BS-Jaccard = \u03c3\u0302BS(\u03c9 CiuC j BS , \u03c9 CitC j BS )"}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "As can be seen, \u03c3BS can be adapted as an alternate paradigm for DL subsumption reasoning.

In the future we will be exploring these research prospects and other possibilities such as probabilistic reasoning on LB , A-Box reasoning, and reasoning over higher expressive DL."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we have proposed BitSim (\u03c3BS ) - an algebraic similarity measure for concept definitions in ALCH+ .
