The proposed schema handles mainly the request and response acts that occurs frequently in inquiry-answer debate conversations expressing request services, suggests, and offers. We applied the proposed schema on 83 Arabic inquiry-answer dialogues.\nI. Introduction Arabic Natural Language Processing (ANLP) including Arabic Language Understanding (ALU) within\ndialogue-based research has gained an increasing interest in the last few years. Building an ALU system requires an annotated dialogue acts (DAs) corpora that is annotated according to a specified dialogue acts schema.\nInquiry-answer is an important part of industry world because it is the core of a successful business.\nWhen quality services are met and exceed customer expectations, the customers are pleased. In order to ensure this happens, service managers (inquiry-answer operators) need to be aware of the parts of the service delivery experience that are open to cultural effects[1].\nIn this paper, we propose a dialogue acts annotation schema for Arabic inquiry-answer dialogues. This\nschema defines the dialogue acts using multi-dimensions within communication functions based on request and response that have certain questions, responses and the relation between them.\nIn this paper, we proposed the first version of Arabic inquiry-answer manually annotated dialogues\ncorpus, which contains 83 spoken and written \u2018chat\u2019 dialogues.\nIn the following sections, section 2 summarizes the main annotation schemas developed for English\nlanguage and Arabic language. Section 3 describes the proposed annotation schema. Section 4 describes the annotation corpus and section 5 includes the conclusion.\nII. Related works Dialogue act refers to the meaning of an utterance representation at the level of illocutionary force [2].\nSpeech acts terminology has been addressed by Searle (1969) based on Austin (1962) work.\nThe idea of a dialogue act plays a key role in studies of dialogue, especially in communicative behavior\nunderstanding of dialogue participants, in building annotated dialogue corpora and in the design of dialogue management systems for spoken human-computer dialogue. Dialogue act is approximately the equivalent of the speech act of Searle (1969). Dialog acts are different in different dialog systems. The research on dialog acts has increased since 1999, after spoken dialog systems became a commercial reality[3].\nThe MapTask project [4] proposed labeling schema using 12 dialogue acts based on two categories (1)\ninitiating moves (2) response. The VERBMOBIL project (1993-2000) aimed at the development of an automatic speech to speech translation system for the languages German, American English and Japanese [5]. The VERBMOBIL Project had two phases, the first phase proposed labeling schema using hierarchy of 43 dialogue acts [6]. The second phase expanded the dialogues from meeting scheduling to comprehensive travel planning. Thus change labeling schema to a hierarchy of 18 dialogue acts [7].\nThe DAMSL Dialogue Act Markup using Several Layers (DAMSL) were proposed as a general- pur-\npose schema [8-10] developed for multi-dimensional dialogue acts annotation. SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL is improved version of DAMSL proposed by [11]when they wanted to annotate a large amount of transcribed speech data \u2018Switchboard Corpus\u2019 because of the difficulty of consistently applying the DAMSL annotation schema [11, 12]. SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL schema includes 220 dialogues acts, but it is still difficult to be used for manual annotation because it is a very large set. Moreover, [11]reported 0.80 of Kappa score with the 220 dialogue acts and 130 dialogue acts occurred less than 10 times in the entire corpus [13]. To obtain enough data per class for statistical modeling purposes, [11]proposed new dialogue act schema namely SWITCHBOARD contains 42 mutually exclusive dialogue acts types.\nInternational organization of Scientific Research 33 | P a g e\nThe ICSI-MRDA Meeting Room corpus use DA variant of the DAMSL dialogue acts schema like the SWITCHBOARD corpus by combining the tags into single, distinct dialogue acts to reduce aspects of the multidimensional nature of the original DAMSL annotation scheme. There are 11 general tags and 39 specific acts that are used over ICSI-MRDA Meeting Room corpus [14]. The AMI project, a European research project centered on multi-modal meeting room technology, uses 15 dialogue acts.\nDynamic Interpretation Theory (DIT) [15] reported dialogue acts schema with a number of dialogue act\ntypes from DAMSL [8] and other schema. The DIT++ is a comprehensive system of dialogue act types obtained by extending the acts of DIT [16]. DIT++ schema has 11 dimensions with around 95 communicative functions, around 42 of which, like switchboard are for general purpose functions, whereas others cover elements of feedback, interaction management and the control of social obligations [13].\n[17]has proposed a preliminary version of ISO DIS 24617-2:2010 as an international standard for anno-\ntating dialogue with semantic information; in particular concerning the communicative functions of the utterances, the kind of content they address, and the dependency relations to what was said and done earlier in the dialogue. [18]has proposed the final version of ISO Standard 24617-2.\nMost of the previous proposed annotation schemes to mark-up dialogue corpora in languages such as\nEnglish, German and Spanish. There are few efforts were done to propose dialogue acts annotation schema for Arabic. First attempt was by [19] which proposed a DAs classifier with scheme that contains about 10 DAs (assertion, declaration, denial, expressive evaluation, greeting, indirect request, question, promise/denial, response to question, and short-response).\n(Dbabis et al., 2012) proposed another DAs schema within an Arabic discussion that contains about 13\nDAs within 6 categories: Social Obligation Management (e.g. Opening, Closing, Greeting \u2026 etc.), Turn Management (e.g. Acknowledgement, Calm, Clarify Request \u2026 etc.), Request (e.g. Question, Order, Promise \u2026 etc.), Argumentation (e.g. Opinion, Appreciation, Accept, Reject \u2026 etc.), Answer, and Statement [20]. These schemas were used to mark-up dialogue corpora based on a general conversion discussion like TV talk-show programs.\nThere are two other works concerned with understanding the Arabic inquiry-answer dialogue conver-\nsions, [21] proposed an annotation schema to semantically label words on spoken Tunisian dialect turns which are not segmented into utterances as shown in Figure 1. This schema was applied on TUDICOI corpus that contains dialogues collected from the National Company of Railway in Tunisia (SNCFT). This schema was used to mark-up word-by-word in dialogue turn not turns or utterances dialogue acts. This schema contains about 33 semantic labels for word annotation within 5 dimensions e.g. Train_Type, Trip_Time, and Destination.\n[ \u0639\u0645 Out] [ \u0634\u0627\u062a\u0642\u0648 Hour_Req] [ \u064a\u0625Out] [ \u064a\u0625Out] [ \u0646\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0644\u0627Train] [ \u064a\u0634\u0645\u064a Departure_Cpt]\nFigure 1 Example of semantic labeling from [21]\n[22] proposed a dialogue acts classifier based on hotel reservations corpus that consist of 100 queries of\ndifferent types (negation, affirmation, interrogation and acceptance). They used a small test set that contained 140 utterances with 14 different dialogue acts that is uttered spontaneously to evaluate their system. This dialogue acts are incomplete to build a inquiry-answer discourse structure because this tag set can\u2019t annotate communicative functions related to social obligations, suggestions, miss understanding correction, warnings, explanation \u2026 etc.\nIII. Annotation Schema In this work, we started from dialogue acts in a previous annotation schema for either Arabic or Eng-\nlish. We proposed a general dialogue acts annotation schema for inquiry-answer based request and response dimensions. Table 1,Table 2, and Table 3 describe the proposed dialogue acts based on request dimension within 6 dialogue acts, response dimension within 14 dialogue acts, and other dimension within 3 dialogue acts.\nRequest Acts Dealing with request activities and tasks Taking-Request Dealing with taking request e.g. hello Service-Question Dealing with services request e.g. asking about service information or required a service. Confirm-Question Happens when needs to confirmation about some information. YesNo-Question Happens when needs Yes or No answer.\nInternational organization of Scientific Research 34 | P a g e\nWe set \u2018Agree\u2019 dialogue act to describe the agreement/acceptance answers as accept-confirmation, Yes-\nAnswer, accept-thanking, and accept-apology. In contrast, we set \u2018Disagree\u2019 dialogue act to describe the disa-\nInternational organization of Scientific Research 35 | P a g e\ngreement/reject answer as disconfirm, No-Answer, and Reject-thanking, Reject-apology. Our empirical analysis for our corpus leaded to identifying \u2018Opening\u2019 dialogue act as a group of \u2018Greeting\u2019 act and \u2018self-Introduce\u2019 act. For example from our corpus:\nThis turn tagged as \u2018Opening\u2019 dialogue act and segmented to three utterances as:  \u0631\u064a\u062e\u0644\u0627 \u0621\u0627\u0633\u0645/msA' Alxyr/Good evening is tagged as \u2018Greeting\u2019 dialogue act.  \u0631\u0635\u0645 \u0643\u0646\u0628/ bnk mSr/Banque Misr is tagged as \u2018Self-Introduce\u2019 dialogue act.  \u0643\u062a\u0631\u0636\u062d \u0639\u0645 \u062f\u0645\u062d\u0627/ AHmd mE HDrtk/Ahmed speaking is tagged as \u2018Self-Introduce\u2019 dialogue act.\nIV. Annotation Corpus For the best of our knowledge, there is no corpus for annotated Arabic spoken or written \u2018chat\u2019 dialo-\ngues in Arabic dialect. For this reason, we built our own corpus as the first version of manually annotated corpus for Arabic dialogue language understanding including spoken dialogue and written \u2018chat\u2019 dialogue for inquiryanswer domain.\nThis corpus contains two parts (1) spoken dialogue which contains 52 phone calls recorded from Egyp-\ntian\u2019s banks inquiry-answer and Egypt Air Company with an average duration of two hour of talking time after removing ads from calls. It consists of human-human discussions about providing services e.g. create new bank account, service request, balance check and flight reservation. These phone calls were transcribed using Transcriber\u00ae, a tool that is frequently used for segmenting, labeling and transcribing speech corpora. (2) Written \u2018Chat\u2019 dialogues, which contain 30 chat dialogues, recorded from mobile agencies web sites \u2018KSA Zain, KSA Mobily, and KSA STC\u2019.\nThis corpus contains 3001 turns with average 6.7 words per turn and contains 4727 utterances with average 4.3 words per utterance. This corpus is manually segmented and annotated using the proposed schema. An annotation tool was developed to manually annotate dialogue turns and segment it is to utterances and label the dialogue act. A sample-annotated turn is shown in Figure 2.\nV. Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a general dialogue acts schema for Arabic inquiry-answer dialogue either\nspoken or written \u2018chat\u2019. We proposed the first version of the manually annotated inquiry-answer dialogue as a part of Arabic language understanding methodologies.\nIn addition, we introduced the first version of annotated corpus that includes 83 inquiry-answer dialo-\ngues from banks, Airlines Company, and mobile networks agency. In future work we plan to enrich this corpus with inquiry-answer dialogues from other domains e.g. Online Markets, and Railway Networks in both forms spoken and written \u2018chat\u2019 dialogues."}], "references": [{"title": "A Six Continent Study of Customer Service,", "author": ["S.
