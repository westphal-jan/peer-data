Such reasoning patterns, and therefore non-monotonicity, acquires a special significance in the context of spatio-temporal dynamics, or computational commonsense reasoning about space, actions, and change as applicable within areas as disparate as geospatial dynamics, computer-aided design, cognitive vision, commonsense cognitive robotics [6]. Dynamic spatial systems are characterised by scenarios where spatial configurations of objects undergo a change as the result of interactions within a physical environment [9]; this requires explicitly identifying and formalising relevant actions and events at both an ontological and (qualitative and geometric) spatial level, e.g. formalising desertification ar X iv :1\n50 6.\n04 92\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 6\nJu n\n20 15\n2 P.

This calls for a deep integration of spatial reasoning within KR-based non-monotonic reasoning frameworks [7]. We select aspects of a theory of dynamic spatial systems \u2014pertaining to (spatial) inertia, ramifications, causal explanation\u2014 that are inherent to a broad category of dynamic spatio-temporal phenomena, and require non-monotonic reasoning [9,5]. For these aspects, we provide an operational semantics and a computational framework for realising fundamental non-monotonic spatial reasoning capabilities based on Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories [3]; ASPMT is extended to the qualitative spatial (QS) domain resulting in the non-monotonic spatial reasoning system ASPMT(QS). Spatial reasoning is performed in an analytic manner (e.g. as with reasoners such as CLP(QS) [8]), where spatial relations are encoded as systems of polynomial constraints; the task of determining whether a spatial graph G is consistent is now equivalent to determining whether the system of polynomial constraints is satisfiable, i.e. Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) with real nonlinear arithmetic, and can be accomplished in a sound and complete manner. Thus, ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module and a method for turning tight ASPMT instances into Sat Modulo Theories (SMT) instances in order to compute stable models by means of SMT solvers. In the following sections we present the relevant foundations of stable model semantics and ASPMT, and then extend this to ASPMT(QS) by defining a (qualitative) spatial representations module, and formalising spatial default reasoning and spatial frame axioms using choice formulas. We empirically evaluate ASPMT(QS) in comparison with other existing spatial reasoning systems. We conclude that ASMPT(QS) is the only system, to the best of our knowledge, that operationalises dynamic spatial reasoning within a KR-based framework."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Bartholomew \u2013 Lee Stable Models Semantics", "text": "We adopt a definition of stable models based on syntactic transformations [2] which is a generalization of the previous definitions from [14] [19] and [13].

With topological calculi such as the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) [25], the primitive entities are spatially extended regions of space, and could possibly even be 4D spatio-temporal histories, e.g., for motion-pattern analyses. Alternatively, within a dynamic domain involving translational motion, point-based abstractions with orientation calculi could suffice. Examples of orientation calculi include: the Oriented-Point Relation Algebra (OPRAm) [22], the Double-Cross Calculus [16]. The qualitative spatial domain (QS) that we consider in the formal framework of this paper encompasses the following ontology:\nQS1. Domain Entities in QS Domain entities in QS include circles, triangles, points and segments. While our method is applicable to a wide range of 2D and 3D spatial objects and qualitative relations, for brevity and clarity we primarily focus on a 2D spatial domain. Our method is readily applicable to other 2D and 3D spatial domains and qualitative relations, for example, as defined in [23,11,24,12,8,26,27].\n\u2013 a point is a pair of reals x, y \u2013 a line segment is a pair of end points p1, p2 (p1 6= p2) \u2013 a circle is a centre point p and a real radius r (0 < r) \u2013 a triangle is a triple of vertices (points) p1, p2, p3 such that p3 is left of segment p1, p2.\nQS2.

A parametric function is an n\u2013ary function fn : D1\u00d7D2\u00d7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00d7Dn \u2192 R such that for any i \u2208 {1 . . . n},Di is a type of spatial object, e.g., Points, Circles, Polygons, etc.\nExample 1. Consider following parametric functions x : Circles\u2192 R, y : Circles\u2192 R, r : Circles \u2192 R which return the position values x, y of a circle\u2019s centre and its radius r, respectively. Then, circle c \u2208 Cirlces may be described by means of parametric functions as follows: x(c) = 1.23 \u2227 y(c) = \u22120.13 \u2227 r(c) = 2.\nDefinition 8 (Qualitative spatial relation). A qualitative spatial relation is an n-ary predicate Qn \u2286 D1 \u00d7D2 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7Dn such that for any i \u2208 {1 . . . n}, Di is a type of spatial object. For each Qn there is a corresponding formula of the form\n\u2200d1 \u2208 D1 . . .\u2200dn \u2208 Dn ( Qn(d1, . . . , dn)\u2190 p1(d1, . . . , dn)\u2227\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2227pm(d1, . . . , dn) ) (6)\nwhere m \u2208 N and for any i \u2208 {1 . . . n}, pi is a polynomial equation or inequality.\nProposition 1. Each qualitative spatial relation according to Definition 8 may be represented as a tight formula in Clark normal form.\nProof. Follows directly from Definitions 3 and 8.\nThus, qualitative spatial relations belong to a part of ASPMT that may be turned into SMT instances by transforming the implications in the corresponding formulas into equivalences (Clark completion). The obtained equivalence between polynomial expressions and predicates enables us to compute relations whenever parametric information is given, and vice versa, i.e. computing possible parametric values when only the qualitative spatial relations are known. Many relations from existing qualitative calculi may be represented in ASPMT(QS) according to Definition 8; our system can express the polynomial encodings presented in e.g. [23,11,24,12,8]. Here we give some illustrative examples.\nProposition 2. Each relation of Interval Algebra (IA) [1] and Rectangle Algebra (RA) [20] may be defined in ASPMT(QS).\nProof. Each IA relation may be described as a set of equalities and inequalities between interval endpoints (see Figure 1 in [1]), which is a conjunction of polynomial expressions. RA makes use of IA relations in 2 and 3 dimensions. Hence, each relation is a conjunction of polynomial expressions [27].\nProposition 3. Each relation of RCC\u20135 in the domain of convex polygons with a finite maximum number of vertices may be defined in ASPMT(QS).\n6 P. Wa\u0142e\u0328ga, M. Bhatt, C. Schultz\nProof. Each RCC\u20135 relation may be described by means of relationsP (a, b) andO(a, b). In the domain of convex polygons, P (a, b) is true whenever all vertices of a are in the interior (inside) or on the boundary of b, and O(a, b) is true if there exists a point p that is inside both a and b. Relations of a point being inside, outside or on the boundary of a polygon can be described by polynomial expressions e.g. [8]. Hence, all RCC\u20135 relations may be described with polynomials, given a finite upper limit on the number of vertices a convex polygon can have.\nProposition 4. Each relation of Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC) [15] may be defined in ASPMT(QS).\nProof. CDC relations are obtained by dividing space with 4 lines into 9 regions. Since halfplanes and their intersections may be described with polynomial expressions, then each of the 9 regions may be encoded with polynomials. A polygon object is in one or more of the 9 cardinal regions by the topological overlaps relation between polygons, which can be encoded with polynomials (i.e. by the existence of a shared point) [8]."}, {"heading": "3.3 Choice Formulas in ASPMT(QS)", "text": "A choice formula [14] is defined for a predicate constant p as Choice(p) \u2261 \u2200x(p(x) \u2228 \u00acp(x)) and for function constant f as Choice(f) \u2261 \u2200x(f(x) = y\u2228\u00acf(x) = y), where x is a list of distinct object variables and y is an object variable distinct from x. We use the following notation: {F} for F \u2228\u00acF , \u2200xy{f(x) = y} for Choice(f) and \u2200x{p(x)} for Choice(p). Then, {t = t\u2019}, where t contains an intentional function constant and t\u2019 does not, represents the default rule stating that t has a value of t\u2019 if there is no other rule requiring t to take some other value.\nDefinition 9 (Spatial choice formula). The spatial choice formula is a rule of the form (8) or (7):\n{fn(d1, . . . , dn) = x} \u2190 \u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 \u03b1k, (7)\n{Qn(d1, . . . , dn)} \u2190 \u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 \u03b1k.

The spatial frame axiom is a special case of a spatial choice formula which states that, by default, a spatial property remains the same in the next step of a simulation. It takes the form (9) or (10):\n{fn(d1, . . . , dn\u22121, s+ 1) = x} \u2190 fn(d1, . . . , dn\u22121, s) = x, (9)\n{Qn(d1, . . . , dn\u22121, s+ 1)} \u2190 Qn(d1, . . . , dn\u22121, s). (10) where fn is a parametric function, x \u2208 R, Qn is a qualitative spatial relation, and s \u2208 N represents a step in the simulation.\nASPMT(QS): Non-Monotonic Spatial Reasoning 7\nCorollary 1. One spatial frame axiom for each parametric function and qualitative spatial relation is enough to formalise the intuition that spatial properties, by default, do not change over time.\nThe combination of spatial reasoning with stable model semantics and arithmetic over the reals enables the operationalisation of a range of novel features within the context of dynamic spatial reasoning.

Wa\u0142e\u0328ga, M. Bhatt, C. Schultz\n5.1 Ramification Problem\nThe following two problems, Growth and Motion, were introduced in [5]. Consider the initial situation S0 presented in Figure 3, consisting of three cells: a, b, c, such that a is a non-tangential proper part of b: rccNTPP(a, b, 0), and b is externally connected to c: rccEC(b, c, 0).\n.Growth. Let a grow in step S0; the event growth(a, 0) occurs and leads to a successor situation S1. The direct effect of growth(a, 0) is a change of a relation between a and b from rccNTPP(a, b, 0) to rccEQ(a, b, 1) (i.e. a is equal to b). No change of the relation between a and c is directly stated, and thus we must derive the relation rccEC(a, c, 1) as an indirect effect.\n. Motion. Let a move in step S0; the event motion(a, 0) leads to a successor situation S1. The direct effect is a change of the relation rccNTPP(a, b, 0) to rccTPP(a, b, 1) (a is a tangential proper part of b). In the successor situation S1 we must determine that the relation between a and c can only be either rccDC(a, c, 1) or rccEC(a, c, 1).\nGQR provides no support for domain-specific reasoning, and thus we encoded the problem as two distinct qualitative constraint networks (one for each simulation step) and solved them independently i.e. with no definition of growth and motion. Thus, GQR is not able to produce any additional information about indirect effects. As Clingo lacks any mechanism for analytic geometry, we implemented the RCC8 composition table and thus it inherits the incompleteness of relation algebraic reasoning. While CLP(QS) facilitates the modelling of domain rules such as growth, there is no native support for default reasoning and thus we forced b and c to remain unchanged between simulation steps, otherwise all combinations of spatially consistent actions on b and c are produced without any preference (i.e. leading to the frame problem). In contrast, ASPMT(QS) can express spatial inertia, and derives indirect effects directly from spatial reasoning: in the Growth problem ASPMT(QS) abduces that a has to be concentric with b in S0 (otherwise a move event would also need to occur). Checking global consistency of scenarios that contain interdependent spatial relations is a crucial feature that is enabled by a support polynomial encodings and is provided only by CLP(QS) and ASPMT(QS)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Geometric Reasoning and the Frame Problem", "text": "In problems Attachment I and Attachment II the initial situation S0 consists of three objects (circles), namely car, trailer and garage as presented in Figure 4. Initially, the trailer is attached to the car: rccEC(car, trailer, 0), attached(car, trailer, 0). The successor situation S1 is described by rccTPP(car, garage, 1). The task is to infer the possible relations between the trailer and the garage, and the necessary actions that would need to occur in each scenario.\nASPMT(QS): Non-Monotonic Spatial Reasoning 11\nThere are two domain-specific actions: the car can move, move(car, X), and the trailer can be detached, detach(car, trailer, X) in simulation step X . Whenever the trailer is attached to the car, they remain rccEC. The car and the trailer may be either completely outside or completely inside the garage.\n. Attachment I. Given the available topological information, we must infer that there are two possible solutions (Figure. 4); (a) the car was detached from the trailer and then moved into the garage: (b) the car, together with the trailer attached to it, moved into the garage: . Attachment II. We are given additional geometric information about the objects\u2019 size: r(car) = 2, r(trailer) = 2 and r(garage) = 3. Case (b) is now inconsistent, and we must determine that the only possible solution is (a). These domain-specific rules require default reasoning: \u201ctypically the trailer remains in the same position\u201d and \u201ctypically the trailer remains at-\ntached to the car\u201d. The later default rule is formalised in ASPMT(QS) by means of the spatial defaul.: The formalisation of such rules addresses the frame problem. GQR is not capable of expressing the domain-specific rules for detachment and attachment in Attachment I and Attachment II. Neither GQR nor Clingo are capable of reasoning with a combination of topological and numerical information, as required in Attachment II. As CLP(QS) cannot express default rules, we can not capture the notion that, for example, the trailer should typically remain in the same position unless we have some explicit reason for determining that it moved; once again this leads to an exhaustive enumeration of all possible scenarios without being able to specify preferences, i.e. the frame problem, and thus CLP(QS) will not scale in larger scenarios. The results of the empirical evaluation show that ASPMT(QS) is the only system that is capable of (a) non-monotonic spatial reasoning, (b) expressing domain-specific rules that also have spatial aspects, and (c) integrating both qualitative and numerical information. Regarding the greater execution times in comparison to CLP(QS), we have not yet implemented any optimisations with respect to spatial reasoning; this is one of the directions of future work."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have presented ASPMT(QS), a novel approach for reasoning about spatial change within a KR paradigm. By integrating dynamic spatial reasoning within a KR framework, namely answer set programming (modulo theories), our system can be used to model behaviour patterns that characterise high-level processes, events, and activities as identifiable with respect to a general characterisation of commonsense reasoning about space, actions, and change [6,9].

We have demonstrated that no other existing spatial reasoning system is capable of supporting the key non-monotonic spatial reasoning features (e.g., spatial inertia, ramification) provided by ASPMT(QS) in the context of a mainstream knowledge representation and reasoning method, namely, answer set programming.\nAcknowledgments.

ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module (QS) and a method for turning tight ASPMT instances into Sat Modulo Theories (SMT) instances in order to compute stable models by means of SMT solvers. We formalise and implement concepts of default spatial reasoning and spatial frame axioms using choice formulas. Spatial reasoning is performed by encoding spatial relations as systems of polynomial constraints, and solving via SMT with the theory of real nonlinear arithmetic. We empirically evaluate ASPMT(QS) in comparison with other prominent contemporary spatial reasoning systems. Our results show that ASPMT(QS) is the only existing system that is capable of reasoning about indirect spatial effects (i.e. addressing the ramification problem), and integrating geometric and qualitative spatial information within a non-monotonic spatial reasoning context.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
