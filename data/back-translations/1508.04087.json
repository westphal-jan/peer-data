Also, information compression and MLE are closely\n3See also \u201cLanguage learning\u201d in www.cognitionresearch.org.\nrelated to algorithmic information theory (AIT), and Kolmogorov complexity (KC) [28].\nAmongst these inter-related areas of study, distinctive features of the SP theory are:\n\u2022 Most research on information compression, MLE, AIT, and KC, assumes that \u2018computing\u2019 is defined by the Universal Turing Machine.

This may seem unduly presumptious since the SP system, unlike some NNs, has not won any competitions and has not been adopted or promoted by any company or incorporated in any products. But for reasons given in the subsections that follow, it appears that the SP system is built on firmer foundations than the current generation of NNs, and its long-term prospects are better. As noted in Appendix A.9, there is also potential for applications on relatively short timescales.\nThe great variety of NNs makes it difficult to say things that are true of all of them.

But NNs are not multiple alignments and provide much less scope for adaptation:\n\u2022 Standardly, the number of layers of an NN and the size of each layer are pre-defined, whereas the number of rows in a multiple alignment, and their sizes, depend entirely on the incoming and stored information from which it is built.4\n\u2022 Normally, there is just one set of layers in an NN with a structure that is fixed, although its behaviour may be changed via changes in the strengths of links within the structure. By contrast, the SP system works by building what is normally a great diversity multiple alignments, each one created by drawing patterns from a pool of New patterns and what may be a very large pool of Old patterns.\n\u2022 Standardly, any given layer in an NN connects only with the layer immediately above (if any) and immediately below (if any). By contrast, any given row in a multiple alignment may have connections with any other row, depending on what the multiple alignment represents.\n\u2022 Learning in the SP system is quite different from learning in an NN. Instead of varying the strengths of links between neurons, the SP system learns by creating Old patterns, which may be derived directly from New patterns or, more commonly, from multiple alignments containing New and Old patterns."}, {"heading": "4.2 Biological validity", "text": "It is generally recognised that NNs are only loosely related to biological systems. For example: \u201cIn modern software implementations of artificial neural networks, the approach inspired by biology has been largely abandoned for a more practical approach based on statistics and signal processing.\u201d5\nAlthough there are still big gaps in our knowledge of neural structures in the brain and their functions, it appears that the organisation and workings of the SP system is better supported by available evidence:\n\u2022 Models of language learning. As noted in Section 2.9, the SP programme of research derives largely from earlier research developing computer models of language learning in children. That research is underpinned by much relevant empirical evidence.\n4But in the \u2018Group Method of Data Handling\u2019 (GMDH), the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer depend on the problem being solved [42, Section 5.3]. However, it is evident from a review of research in this area [19] that NNs of this type are quite different from multiple alignments in the SP system, and they appear to have much less versatility and adaptability.\n5\u201cArtificial neural network\u201d, Wikipedia, bit.ly/1I5qib7, retrieved 2015-07-16.\n\u2022 Cell assemblies. In SP-neural (Appendix A.6, [55, Chapter 11]), abstract concepts in the SP theory map quite neatly into structures that are quite similar to Donald Hebb\u2019s [13] concept of a \u201ccell assembly\u201d, itself derived from neurophysiological evidence.\n\u2022 Grandmother cells. The organisation of the SP system, including SP neural, implies the existence of single neurons or small bunches of neurons, any one of which may represent a specific concept such as one\u2019s grandmother. And, notwithstanding some scepticism, there is evidence for the existence of such neurons or clusters of neurons [12].6 By contrast, the organisation and workings of NNs suggests that the neural representation of a concept such as one\u2019s grandmother would normally be \u2018distributed\u2019 across many widely-dispersed neurons and many connections amongst neurons. There is more on this issue in Section 4.10.1.\nAlthough the \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018complex\u2019 types of neuron discovered by Hubel and Wiesel [16] appear to have provided some inspiration for DL concepts [42, Section 5.2], they may also be seen to provide empirical support for the SP system, especially SP-neural (Appendix A.6)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Learning paradigms", "text": "Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning\u2014three forms of learning with NNs\u2014are, in that connection, normally treated as alternatives with equal status.7.\nBy contrast, in the SP perspective, unsupervised learning is seen as a foundation for all other forms of learning [59, Sections V-A.1 and V-A.2]. The main reasons are, in brief, that:\n\u2022 Much learning occurs without the benefit of labelled examples, help from a teacher, or carrots and sticks.8\n6It is sometimes suggested that the concept of a grandmother cell or cells is implausible because death of the cell or cells would mean that one could no longer recognise one\u2019s grandmother. But that is exactly the kind of thing that can happen with people who have suffered a stroke or are suffering from dementia.\n7Although Schmidhuber acknowledges that unsupervised learning may facilitate supervised learning and reinforcement learning [42, Section 4.2]\n8With regard to the last point, it is clear that motivations have an influence on learning\u2014we tend to learn things best if they interest us and if we give them attention. But, contrary to the central dogma of Skinnerian learning theory, it is unlikely that motivations are fundamental in learning.\n\u2022 Extraction of redundancy from data, which is central in the SP theory, may be seen to operate not only in unsupervised learning but also in supervised learning\u2014where there is redundancy in the associations between labels and corresponding examples\u2014and in reinforcement learning\u2014where there is redundancy in the associations between actions and corresponding rewards or punishments.\nOverall, the SP system promises to provide a unifying framework for learning, potentially more satisfactory than when different forms of learning are treated separately."}, {"heading": "4.4 Learning from a single occurrence or experience", "text": "Most NNs incorporate some variant of the idea, proposed by Donald Hebb [13] and known as \u201cHebbian learning\u201d, that neurons that repeatedly fire at about the same time will tend to become connected, or for existing connections between them to be strengthened.\nThis mechanism for learning leads to gradual changes in the behaviour of NNs, in keeping with the observation that it normally takes time to learn things like how to talk, or how to win competitions in golf. That correspondence between the workings of NNs and a familiar feature of how we learn may strengthen the belief that NNs are psychologically valid.\nBut this feature of NNs seems to conflict with the undoubted fact that we can and often do learn things from a single occurrence or experience. Getting burned once will teach us to be careful with fire. We may retain memories for many years of significant events in our lives that occurred only once. And we may recognise a face that we have seen only briefly, we may recognise music that we have heard only once before, and likewise for films. It is true that we may rehearse things mentally but often it seems that, with little or no rehearsal, we remember things that have been seen or heard only once.\nBecause the slow strengthening of links between neurons seems not to account for our ability to remember things after a single exposure, Hebb adopted a \u201creverberatory\u201d theory for this kind of memory [13, p. 62]. But, as Milner has pointed out [32], it is difficult to understand how this kind of mechanism could explain our ability to assimilate a previously-unseen telephone number: for each digit in the number, its pre-established cell assembly may reverberate; but this does not explain memory for the sequence of digits in the number. We may add that it is unclear how the proposed mechanism would encode a phone number in which one or more of the digits is repeated.\nThe SP theory provides an explanation both for learning from a single experience and for the fact that some kinds of learning are slow:\n\u2022 Learning in the SP system starts by assimilating New information directly, followed by a possible encoding of the information in terms of any existing Old patterns, and the creation of newly-minted Old patterns via information compression [55, Sections 3.9.2 and 9.2.2], [57, Section 5.1]. The taking in of New information, with or without its encoding in terms of existing Old patterns, means that the system can learn from a single exposure to a pattern or event. That remains true even if shortcomings in memory cause some New information to be lost.\n\u2022 Learning something like a natural language is much more complicated than remembering one\u2019s first day in school or when one had a ride on a camel. With the learning of complex knowledge or skills, the main challenge is heuristic search through the vast abstract space of possible knowledge structures to find one or two that are reasonably good. That process takes time."}, {"heading": "4.5 Computational resources, speed of learning, and", "text": "volumes of data\nIn addition to apparent problems with learning from a single experience, there seem to be related issues with NNs concerning the computational resources they require for learning, their speed of learning, and the volumes of data they require. For example:\n\u2022 One news report9 describes how an NN with \u201c16,000 computer processors\u201d and \u201cone billion connections\u201d was exposed to \u201c10 million randomly selected YouTube video thumbnails\u201d, \u201cover the course of three days\u201d.

Although Grimson does not give run times, it looks as if his program finds the hidden image in a random-dot stereogram about as fast as people\u2014normally in less than a minute.\n\u2022 With run times of only a few minutes on a PC, the SP computer model, founded on ICMUP, demonstrates unsupervised learning of plausible generative grammars for the syntax of English-like artificial languages (Section 8). Similar results have been obtained with earlier models of language learning [53], also founded on ICMUP.\nIt is true that what is being attempted with many NNs is relatively ambitious, but biological neurons are very much slower than electronic ones. On balance, there appear to be problems with NNs relating to the computational efficiency of their learning and the volumes of data they require to obtain useful results."}, {"heading": "4.6 Recognition of images and speech", "text": "With some qualification (Appendices 4.7 and 4.8), NNs do well in tasks such as the recognition of images (eg, [63]) or speech (eg, [5]).\nBut the SP system has strengths in pattern recognition ([55, Chapter 6], [57, Section 9]). These include:\n11According to one estimate [14], the average human brain contains about 86 billion neurons.\n\u2022 That, via multiple alignment, it can recognise patterns at multiple levels of abstraction, with the integration of class-inclusion relations and part-whole relations;\n\u2022 It can model \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d or polythetic categories, meaning that recognition does not depend on the presence absence of any particular feature or combination of features;\n\u2022 Recognition is robust in the face of errors of omission, commission or substitution;\n\u2022 For any given identification, or any related inference, the SP system may calculate associated probabilities;\n\u2022 And the system provides a model for the way in which context may influence recognition.\nWith regard to the last point, any kind of knowledge may influence recognition (as with recognition of things by people), something that flows from how the SP system provides for seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and diverse kinds of processing [62, Section 7].\nIn addition to the strengths just mentioned, in computer vision [58] there is potential in the SP system in:\n\u2022 The recognition of objects;\n\u2022 Scene analysis;\n\u2022 The learning of visual entities and classes of entity and the piecing together of coherent concepts from fragments;\n\u2022 The creation of 3D models of objects and of their surroundings;\n\u2022 Providing an account of how we may see things that are not objectively present in an image;\n\u2022 Providing insights into the phenomena of lightness constancy, colour constancy, and ambiguities in visual perception;\n\u2022 And the integration of vision with other senses and other aspects of intelligence.\nWith vision and speech, the SP computer model, as it is now, has some shortcomings but it appears that these problems are soluble (Appendix A.9): it is not good at the extraction or recognition of low-level perceptual features, such as\u2014in the case of vision\u2014edges, angles, colours, luminances or textures, or\u2014in the case of speech\u2014phonemes, formant ratios or formant transitions . How these problems may be overcome in the case of vision is discussed in [55, Section 13.2.1] and [58, Section 3].\nIn summary, the SP computer model does not yet rival commercial applications of NNs in the recognition of images or speech, but it has relevant strengths and potential."}, {"heading": "4.7 Deep neural networks are easily fooled", "text": "A recent report describes how \u201cWe can cause [a deep neural network] to misclassify an image by applying a certain hardly perceptible perturbation.\u201d [47, Abstract]. For example, the NN may correctly recognise a picture of a car but may fail to recognise another slightly different picture of a car which, to a person, looks almost identical (ibid., Figure 6).\nAnother report [37] describes how at least one kind of deep neural network can be fooled quite easily into assigning an image with near certainty to a recognisable class of objects such as \u2018guitar\u2019 or \u2018penguin\u2019, when people judge the given image to be something like white noise on a TV screen or an abstract pattern containing nothing that resembles a guitar or a penguin or any other object.\nOf course, these kinds of failures are a potential problem in any kind of application where recognition needs to be reliable. And without a good theory for how NNs work (Section 4.11), they may be difficult to weed out.\nWith regard to the errors described in [47], there is already evidence that the SP computer model would not make that kind of mistake. It can recognise words containing errors of omission, commission and substitution [55, Section 6.2.1], and likewise for diseases in medical diagnosis viewed as pattern recognition [54, Section 3.6] and in the parsing of natural language [57, Section 4.2.2].\nNo attempt has been made to test experimentally whether or not the SP computer model is prone to the kinds of errors described in [37], but a knowledge of how it works suggests that it would not be."}, {"heading": "4.8 Under-generalisation and over-generalisation", "text": "An issue with any learning system is its ability to generalise from the data (I) that is the basis of its learning without under-generalisation (\u2018overfitting\u2019) or\nover-generalisation (\u2018underfitting\u2019). If, for example, the system has learned the concept \u2018horse\u2019, it should, in its later recognition of horses, not be too closely constrained to recognise only horses that are identical to or very similar to those in I (under-generalisation) and, at the same time, it should not make such mistakes as assigning cows, sheep or dogs to the category \u2018horse\u2019 (over-generalisation)."}, {"heading": "4.8.1 Under-generalisation in NNs", "text": "It is widely recognised that NNs may suffer from overfitting, and various solutions have been proposed.

Ideas of this kind have been developed by Hutter (eg, [17]), Schmidhuber (eg, [41]), and others.16\nIt would be premature to say that this kind of approach to AI is better than the SP approach, or vice versa. From the perspective of the SP research programme, the main sources of concern are:\n\u2022 The apparent difficulty of translating the abstract concepts of universal search into working models that exhibit aspects of intelligence or are potentially useful.\n\u2022 The apparent difficulty of squeezing the subtlety and complexity of human intelligence into the procrustean bed of \u2018well defined problems\u2019 [17]\u2014something that appears to be a prerequisite for universal search.\n16For a useful overview, see \u201cUniversal search\u201d by Matteo Gagliolo [8].\n\u2022 With problems in AI, it is rarely possible to guarantee solutions that are theoretically ideal\u2014a focus of interest in research on universal search.

By contrast, the SP system provides mechanisms for finding good full and partial matches between patterns (Appendix A.4.1), for building multiple alignments (Appendix A.4.2), and for creating grammars (Appendix A.4.3), and it has plenty to say about a range of observations and concepts in AI and beyond."}, {"heading": "6 Some models for AI", "text": "This section considers briefly some of the systems that have been proposed as models for AI, or aspects of AI: Bayesian networks, support vector machines, hidden Markov models, Kalman filters, self-organising maps, Petri nets, and cellular automata.\nThe suggestion here, which is admittedly a rather sweeping generalisation, is that, while these models are admirably simple, and while they may have applications in particular areas, they lack the descriptive and explanatory range of the SP system. In terms of the quest for a wide-ranging theory (Sections B and 2.1), their scope is too narrow.\nIn addition to its relatively wide scope, the SP system, compared with a Bayesian network, has two main advantages:\n\u2022 Simplicity in the representation of statistical knowledge. Each node in a Bayesian network contains a table of conditional probabilities for all possible combinations of inputs and these tables can be quite large. By contrast, the SP framework only requires a single measure of frequency for each pattern. Absolute or conditional probabilities can be derived from that frequency measure, as required.\n\u2022 Creation of ontologies.

The SP computer model is not an immediate rival to existing systems but its long-term potential is considerable:\n\u2022 It can model the parsing of natural language directly and transparently, as illustrated in Figure 2;\n\u2022 In parsing, it can accommodate syntactic ambiguities, the resolution of ambiguities via the provision of appropriate context, and recursive structures in syntax;\n\u2022 Parsing is robust against errors of omission, commission, or substitution;\n\u2022 One mechanism may achieve both the parsing and production of natural language, without any modification;\n\u2022 The system provides for the representation and processing of several different non-syntactic or \u2018semantic\u2019 forms of knowledge;\n\u2022 Preliminary tests show how the system may integrate syntax with semantics, both in the interpretation and the production of language.\nThese things are described most fully in [55, Chapter 5] and more briefly and selectively in [57, Section 8].

Even more difficult is automatic learning of the kinds of syntactic-semantic structures that are needed for such things as interpreting the meaning of natural language, the production of speech or writing from meanings, and, when it is done at a high standard, translation from one language to another.\nAs mentioned in Appendix A, the SP programme of research grew out earlier research developing computer models of language learning, but has required a radical reorganisation of earlier models to meet the goals of the SP programme. Now, the SP computer model demonstrates unsupervised learning of plausible generative grammars for the syntax of English-like artificial languages, including the learning of segmental structures, classes of structure, and abstract patterns [55, Chapter 9], in accordance with the DONSVIC principle (Section 2.7). It appears that, with some further work outlined in Sections 8.1 and 8.2, the potential is considerable.\n8.0.4 Learning without over-generalisation or under-generalisation\nAs noted in Appendix A.4.5, unsupervised learning via compression of a body of information, I, produces a \u2018grammar\u2019 and an \u2018encoding\u2019 of I in terms of the grammar, and there is a trade-off in size between the two. And, normally, the greatest overall compression of I is achieved with a grammar that is neither too big nor too small.\nIt appears that this solves a long-standing problem in understanding how children learn their first language or languages: to explain how children learn to generalise correctly beyond the language they have heard and to weed out over-generalisations (such as \u201chitted\u201d or \u201cgooses\u201d)\u2014and this in the face of evidence that they can do these things without correction by a \u2018teacher\u2019, or anything equivalent. It appears that, for a given I, a learning process that aims to minimise the overall size of the grammar and the encoding is likely to yield a grammar that generalises correctly beyond I but does not overgeneralise. These things are discussed briefly in [57, Section 5.3] and more fully in [53]."}, {"heading": "8.1 Learning the syntax of natural language", "text": "As it stands, the SP computer model cannot learn a plausible grammar for any natural language, probably because of two weaknesses mentioned in Appendix A.9: its inability to learn intermediate levels of abstraction or discontinuous dependencies in data.

This has led to several proposals for systems that, in one way or another, combine exact or \u2018logical\u2019 reasoning with inexact, \u2018fuzzy\u2019 or \u2018probabilistic\u2019 kinds of reasoning (eg, [64, 22]). Some recent developments are described in [40].\nCompared with these strands of research, distinctive features and apparent advantages of the SP system include:\n\u2022 The SP system is fundamentally probabilistic but the exactness of reasoning may be varied. Because information compression is central in the workings of the SP system (Appendix A.4) and because of the intimate relation between information compression and concepts of prediction and probability [28], the SP system is fundamentally probabilistic. This chimes with research into the fundamentals of mathematics:\n\u201cI have recently been able to take a further step along the path laid out by Go\u0308del and Turing. By translating a particular computer program into an algebraic equation of a type that was familiar even to the ancient Greeks, I have shown that there is randomness in the branch of pure mathematics known as number theory. My work indicates that\u2014to borrow Einstein\u2019s metaphor\u2014God sometimes plays dice with whole numbers.\u201d [2, p. 80].\nFor any given inference reached via any of the kinds of reasoning described below, the SP system may calculate associated probabilities [55, Section 3.7], [57, Section 4.4].\nAlthough the SP system is fundamentally probabilistic, users may control the exactness of the reasoning that it delivers. As in everyday life, we may gain confidence in an uncertain inference or decision by gathering more evidence. And, as in everyday life, we may choose to concentrate on probabilities that are close to 0 or 1, and to ignore the rest.\n\u2022 Modelling concepts from logic and mathematics. Although it may not be obvious at first sight, the multiple alignment framework can model several of the concepts that are familiar in logic and mathematics, including: \u2018variable\u2019, \u2018value\u2019 and \u2018type\u2019 [55, Section 10.3.5.1]; \u2018function\u2019 with \u2018arguments\u2019 or \u2018parameters\u2019 [55, Section 10.3.3.2]; and \u2018sets\u2019 and operations on sets [55, Section 10.4.1]. There is more about these kinds of things in [62, Section 6.6].\n\u2022 Versatility in reasoning. Despite the essential simplicity of the multiple alignment framework, the SP computer model demonstrates several kinds of reasoning, including both exact and probabilistic kinds of reasoning, with clear potential for further development:\n\u2013 One-step \u2018deductive\u2019 reasoning;\n\u2013 Abductive reasoning;\n\u2013 Reasoning with probabilistic decision networks and decision trees;\n\u2013 Reasoning with \u2018rules\u2019;\n\u2013 Nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning with default values;\n\u2013 Reasoning in Bayesian networks, including \u201cexplaining away\u201d;\n\u2013 Causal diagnosis;\n\u2013 Reasoning which is not supported by evidence;\n\u2013 And inheritance of attributes in an object-oriented class hierarchy or heterarchy.\nThe foregoing are described quite fully in [55, Section 6.4, Chapters 7 and 10] and more selectively in [57, Section 10]. There is also potential for spatial reasoning [59, Section IV-F.1] and what-if reasoning [59, Section IV-F.2].\n\u2022 Integration of diverse forms of reasoning. An attraction of the SP system is that there can be seamless integration of two or more kinds of reasoning, in any combination (Section 2.2).\n\u2022 Integration with other aspects of intelligence.

This complexity is compounded by the fact that, normally, each formalism and each format has its own mode of processing. Until recently, this complexity has been easy to ignore. But with the advent of big data, it has become a major problem, a problem that the SP system may help to solve (Section 12.1).\nAs described in outline in [60, Section III-B], and in more detail in [55, 57], the SP system can represent a variety of kinds of knowledge including:\n\u2022 The syntax of natural language;\n\u2022 Class hierarchies, part-whole hierarchies, and their integration;17\n\u2022 Trees and networks, including Bayesian networks;\n\u2022 Entity-relationship structures;\n\u2022 Relational knowledge (tuples);\n\u2022 If-then rules, associations, and other knowledge in support of reasoning;\n\u2022 Patterns and images;\n\u2022 Structures in three dimensions;\n\u2022 And sequential and parallel procedures.\nSince information compression is at the heart of how knowledge is represented in the SP system, and since the multiple alignment framework appears to be a very general means of compressing information, there is reason to believe that any kind of knowledge may be represented in the system.

This will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system, and to create new versions of it.\nAppendices"}, {"heading": "A Outline of the SP theory", "text": "An noted in the introduction, the SP theory is a unique attempt to simplify and integrate observations and concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, mathematics, and human perception and cognition.\nThe theory and its applications are described most fully in [55] and more briefly in [57]. Other aspects of the theory are described in other papers referenced elsewhere in this paper.\nThe theory is conceived as an abstract brain-like system that, in an \u2018input\u2019 perspective, may receive New information via its senses, and compress some or all of it to create Old information, as illustrated schematically in Figure 1. In the theory, information compression is the mechanism both for the learning and organisation of knowledge and for pattern recognition, reasoning, problem solving, and more.\nThe SP theory originates in part from an earlier programme of research on grammatical inference and the unsupervised learning of natural language, with information compression as a unifying theme (summarised in [53]). However, meeting the goals of the SP research programme has meant a radical reorganisation of the system, with the development of a concept of multiple alignment (Appendix A.4.2) as a framework for the simplification and integration of diverse structures and functions [59, Section V-A.4].\nThe subsections that follow outline the main elements of the theory.\nA.1 Foundations\nThe SP theory is founded on a range of observations suggesting the fundamental importance of information compression in natural and artificial\nintelligence, in computing, and in mathematics ([61], [55, Chapter 2]).\nA.2 The SP computer model and the SP machine\nThe SP theory is realised in the form of a computer model, SP71, which may be regarded as a version of the SP machine.\nAn outline of the organisation and workings of the SP computer model works may be found in [55, Section 3.9], with more detail, including pseudocode, in [55, Sections 3.10 and 9.2].24 Fully commented source code for the SP71 computer model may be downloaded via a link near the bottom of www.cognitionresearch.org/sp.htm, and via \u201cAncillary files\u201d under www.arxiv.org/abs/1306.3888.\nA.3 Patterns and symbols\nIn the SP system, knowledge is represented with arrays of atomic symbols in one or two dimensions called patterns. The SP71 model works with onedimensional patterns but it is envisaged that the system will be generalised to work with patterns in two dimensions [57, Section 3.3].\nAn \u2018atomic symbol\u2019 in the SP system is simply a mark that can be matched with any other symbol to determine whether it is the same or different: no other result is permitted.\n24These sources describe SP70, a slightly earlier version of the model than SP71 but quite similar to it. The description of SP70 includes a description, in [55, Sections 3.9.1 and 3.10], of a subset of the SP70 model called SP61.\nPatterns in two dimensions are likely to have a role in the processing of images ([55, Chapter 13], [58]) and also in the processing of sensory or motor streams of information that occur in parallel [59, Sections IV-A.4, IV-H, V-G to V=I, and Appendix C].\nIn themselves, SP patterns are not particularly expressive. But within the multiple alignment framework (Appendix A.4.2), they support the representation and processing of a wide variety of kinds of knowledge (Appendix A.7). It appears that the system has potential as a universal framework for the representation and processing of knowledge (UFK) [60, Section III].\nA.4 Information compression\nIn the SP system, all kinds of processing is done by compression of information. This is essentially the principle of minimum length encoding (MLE) [44, 51, 39]25 but with qualifications described in Section 3.\nThe default assumption in the SP theory is that compression of information is always lossless, meaning that all non-redundant information is retained. In particular applications, there may be a case for discarding nonredundant information (see, for example, [60, Section X-B]) but any such discard is reversible.\nThe name \u201cSP\u201d is short for Simplicity and Power, because compression of any given body of information, I, may be seen as a process of reducing \u201credundancy\u201d of information in I and thus increasing its \u201csimplicity\u201d, whilst retaining as much as possible of its non-redundant descriptive and explanatory \u201cpower\u201d. As noted in Section B, it is no accident that the same two concepts are prominent in Occam\u2019s Razor as a touchstone of success for scientific theories.\nIn the SP system, information compression is achieved via the matching and unification of patterns, or parts thereof (\u2018ICMUP\u2019, [61]). More specifically, it is achieved via the building of multiple alignments and via the unsupervised learning of grammars. These three things are described briefly in the following three subsections.\nA.4.1 Information compression via the matching and unification of patterns\nThe basis for information compression in the SP system is a process of searching for patterns that match each other with a process of merging or \u2018unifying\u2019\n25MLE is an umbrella term for \u201cminimum message length\u201d encoding (MML), \u201cminimum description length\u201d encoding (MDL), and similar concepts.\npatterns that are the same: \u201cinformation compression via the matching and unification of patterns\u201d or \u201cICMUP\u201d [61].\nAt the heart of the SP computer model is a method for finding good full and partial matches between sequences with advantages compared with classical methods [55, Appendix A].26\nThe emphasis on ICMUP is motivated partly by evidence of the importance of such processes in human perception and cognition, and partly by its potential to cut through much complexity and to achieve a new perspective on artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and mathematics [61].\nBecause one goal of the SP theory is to develop a new perspective on mathematics (Appendix A), and because ICMUP has been adopted as a foundation for the SP theory, the theory minimises the use of mathematics [61, Section 2.1].\nA.4.2 Information compression via the building of multiple alignments\nThe process for finding good full and partial matches between patterns is the foundation for processes that build multiple alignments like the ones shown in Figure 2. This concept is similar to multiple alignment in bioinformatics but with important differences [55, Section 3.4]. It is a powerful and distinctive feature of the SP system.\nIn Figure 2, the SP pattern in row 0 is a sentence to be parsed, while each of rows 1 to 8 contains an SP pattern representing a grammatical form (where \u2018grammatical form\u2019 includes words). This example shows the best multiple alignment created by the SP computer model when the New pattern is processed in conjunction with a set of pre-existing Old patterns like those shown in rows 1 to 8.\nHere, the \u2018best\u2019 multiple alignment is the one in which the New pattern may be encoded most economically in terms of the Old patterns\u2014and this means a multiple alignment in which there is a relatively large number of symbols that match each other from row to row, aligned in columns. The way in which an encoding is derived from a multiple alignment is explained in [55, Section 3.5] and [57, Section 4.1]. Like all other kinds of knowledge in the SP system, encodings derived from multiple alignments are recorded using SP patterns (Appendix A.3).\n26The main advantages are [55, Section 3.10.3.1]: 1) That it can match arbitrarily long sequences without excessive demands on memory; 2) For any two sequences, it can find a set of alternative matches (each with a measure of how good it is) instead of a single \u2018best\u2019 match; 3) The \u2018depth\u2019 or thoroughness of the searching can be controlled by parameters.\nThe overall effect of this multiple alignment is to analyse the sentence into its grammatical parts and sub-parts, an analysis that is, in its essentials, the same as a conventional parsing.\nA.4.3 Information compression via unsupervised learning\nAs outlined in [55, Section 3.9.2] and [57, Section 5.1], and described more fully in [55, Chapter 9], the SP system may, without assistance from a \u201cteacher\u201d or anything equivalent, derive one or more plausible grammars from a body of New patterns, with information compression as a guiding principle. In that process, multiple alignment has a central role as a source of SP patterns for possible inclusion in any grammar [55, Section 9,2,5], [57, Section 5.1.1].\nAlthough the current model has some shortcomings (Appendix A.9, [57, Section 3.3]), it appears that these problems are soluble.\nA.4.4 Heuristic search\nLike most problems in artificial intelligence, each of the afore-mentioned problems\u2014finding good full and partial matches between patterns, finding or constructing good multiple alignments, and inferring one or more good grammars from a body of data\u2014is normally too complex to be solved by exhaustive search.\nWith intractable problems like these, it is often assumed that the goal is to find theoretically ideal solutions. But with these and most other AI problems, \u201cThe best is the enemy of the good\u201d. By scaling back one\u2019s ambitions and searching for \u201creasonably good\u201d solutions, it is often possible to find solutions that are useful, and without undue computational demands.\nAs with other AI applications, and as with the building of multiple alignments in bioinformatics, the SP71 model uses heuristic techniques\u2014\u2018hill climbing\u2019 or \u2018descent\u2019\u2014in all three cases mentioned above [55, Appendix A; Sections 3.9 and 3.10; Chapter 9]. This means searching for solutions in stages, with a pruning of the search tree at every stage, guided by measures of compression, and with backtracking to increase the chances of success. With these kinds of techniques, acceptably good approximate solutions can normally be found without excessive computational demands and with \u201cbig O\u201d values that are within acceptable limits.\nA.4.5 Grammars and encodings, simplicity and power\nIn unsupervised learning in the SP system, compression of a body of information, I, produces two distinct results: a grammar and an encoding of I in terms of the grammar, both of them expressed as SP patterns. The two together represent a lossless compression of I.\nThe term \u2018grammar\u2019 has been adopted because the SP programme of research derives largely from earlier research on models of language learning and grammatical inference27Summarised in [53].) but, because of the versatility of SP patterns in the multiple alignment framework (Appendix A.3), the term is applied, in this research, to any kind of knowledge, not just natural language.\nOften but not invariably, there is a trade-off between the size of the grammar and the size of the encoding: as a general rule, small grammars yield large encodings and vice versa. Normally, the greatest overall compression of I is obtained with grammars that are not at the extremes of size (small or big), and likewise for encodings. It appears that this means learning that avoids both over-generalisation and under-generalisation (Sections 8.0.4 and 4.8).\nFrom the trade-off we can see that there is a direct relationship between the concepts of \u2018grammar\u2019 and \u2018encoding\u2019 on the one hand, and the aforementioned concepts of \u2018simplicity\u2019 and \u2018power\u2019 on the other: for a given I, there is simplicity in any grammar when the grammar is small, and the grammar has power when the encoding is small. Any reasonably thorough\n27(\ncompression of I is likely to yield a good balance between the two.28\nA.5 Information compression, prediction, and probabilities\nOwing to the close connection between information compression and concepts of prediction and probability [28], the SP system is fundamentally probabilistic. Each SP pattern has an associated frequency of occurrence and probabilities may be calculated for each multiple alignment and for any inference that may be drawn from any given multiple alignment.\nAlthough the SP system is fundamentally probabilistic: it can be constrained to answer only those kinds of questions where probabilities are close to 0 or 1; and, via the use of error-reducing redundancy, it can deliver decisions with high levels of confidence. Contrary to what one may suppose, there is no conflict between the use of error-reducing redundancy and the notion that \u201ccomputing\u201d may be understood as information compression\u2014the two things are independent, as described in [55, Section 2.3.7].\nA.6 SP-neural\nPart of the SP theory is the idea, described most fully in [55, Chapter 11], that the abstract concepts of symbol and pattern in the SP theory may be realised more concretely in the brain with collections of neurons in the cerebral cortex.\nThe neural equivalent of an SP pattern is called a pattern assembly. The word \u201cassembly\u201d has been adopted in this term because the concept is quite similar to Donald Hebb\u2019s [13] concept of a cell assembly. The main difference is that the concept of pattern assembly is unambiguously explicit in proposing that the sharing of structure between two or more pattern assemblies is achieved by means of \u2018references\u2019 from one structure to another, as described and discussed in [55, Section 11.4.1]). Also, learning in the SP system is quite different from the kind of \u201cHebbian\u201d learning that is popular in artificial neural networks (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).\nFigure 3 shows schematically how pattern assemblies may be represented and inter-connected with neurons. Here, each pattern assembly, such as \u2018< NP < D > < N > >\u2019, is represented by the sequence of atomic symbols of the corresponding SP pattern. Each atomic symbol, such as \u2018<\u2019 or \u2018NP\u2019, would\n28Here, the qualification, \u2018reasonably thorough\u2019 is quite important. Compression algorithms like the popular LZ algorithm is \u2018quick and dirty\u2019\u2014it is designed for speed on low-powered computers and, for that reason, will normally miss quite large amounts of redundancy.\nbe represented in the pattern assembly by one neuron or a small group of inter-connected neurons.29 Apart from the inter-connections amongst pattern assemblies, the cortex in SP-neural is somewhat like a sheet of paper on which knowledge may be written in the form of neurons.\nIt is envisaged that any pattern assembly may be \u2018recognised\u2019 if it receives more excitatory inputs than rival pattern assemblies, perhaps via a winnertakes-all mechanism [55, Section 11.3.4]. And, once recognised, any pattern\n29Not shown in the figure are lateral connections within each pattern assembly and inhibitory connections elsewhere, as outlined in [55, Sections 11.3.3 and 11.3.4].\nassembly may itself be a source of excitatory signals leading to the recognition of higher-level pattern assemblies.\nA.7 Empirical and conceptual support for the SP theory\nAs noted in Appendix B.2, the SP theory has non-trivial things to say about a wide range of observations and concepts in artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, mathematics, and human perception and cognition. These things are described most fully in [55], more briefly in [57], and in extended summaries in [59, Sections IV and V]. In a bare-bones summary, the main strengths of the SP system are in:\n\u2022 Natural language processing [55, Chapter 5], [57, Section 8].\n\u2022 Pattern recognition and vision [55, Chapter 6], [57, Section 9], [58].\n\u2022 Information storage and retrieval [55, Chapter 6], [57, Section 11], [56].\n\u2022 The representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge ([57, Section 7], [60, Section III-B] and, more generally, [55, Chapters 5 to 10]).\n\u2022 Benefits accruing from the seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence [62, Sections 2, 5, and 7].\n\u2022 Several kinds of reasoning [55, Chapter 7], [57, Section 10].\n\u2022 Planning and problem solving [55, Chapter 8], [57, Section 12].\n\u2022 Unsupervised learning [55, Chapter 9], [57, Section 5], [59, Section V].\n\u2022 Implications for our understanding of human perception and cognition, including neural processing [55, Chapters 11 and 12], [58].\n\u2022 Implications for our understanding of the nature of mathematics [55, Chapter 10], [61].\nThere is more detail about some of these capabilities in the body of the paper.\nA.8 Potential benefits and applications\nIn summary, potential benefits and applications of the SP system include:\n\u2022 Helping to solve nine problems associated with big data [60].\n\u2022 Computer vision and pattern recognition that models several aspects of natural vision [58], [57, Section 9].\n\u2022 The development of versatility and adaptability in autonomous robots, with potential for gains in computational efficiency [59].\n\u2022 The system may be developed as a versatile database management system, with intelligence [56].\n\u2022 The system may serve as a repository for medical knowledge and as an aid for medical diagnosis [54].\n\u2022 There are several other potential benefits and applications in: simplification of computing systems, including software; unsupervised learning; the processing of natural language; software engineering; information compression; the semantic web; bioinformatics; the detection of computer viruses; data fusion; new kinds of computer; the development of scientific theories; and the seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and processing [62].\nAs describe in Section A.9, next, some potential applications may be developed on relatively short timescales.\nTwo of the potential areas of application\u2014big data and autonomous robots\u2014are outlined in more detail in Section 12.\nA.9 Development of the SP system\nLike most scientific theories, the SP system is not complete [57, Section 3.3]. As it is now, the main shortcomings in the SP computer model are: the process for finding good full and partial matches between one-dimensional patterns needs to be generalised to patterns in two dimensions; a better understanding is needed of how the system may be applied to the discovery and recognition of low-level features in speech and images; in unsupervised learning, the model does not learn intermediate levels of abstraction or discontinuous dependencies in data; and a better understanding is needed of how the system may be applied in the representation and processing of numbers. It appears that none of these problems are showstoppers===that all of them are soluble.\nSince there are many more avenues to be explored than could be tackled by any one research group (Appendices A.7 and A.8), it is envisaged that the SP computer model will be the basis for the creation of a high-parallel, opensource version of the SP machine, hosted on an existing high-performance computer [60, Section XII]. This will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system, and to create new versions of it.\nSome potential applications of the SP system may be developed on relatively short timescales using existing high-performance computers or even ordinary computers. These include the SP system as an intelligent database [56], and applications in such areas as medical diagnosis [54], pattern recognition ([55, Chapter 6], [57, Section 9]), information compression [62, Section 6.7], highly-economical transmission of information [60, Section VIII], bioinformatics [62, Section 6.10.2], and natural language processing [62, Section 6.2]."}, {"heading": "B Occam\u2019s Razor: simplicity and power", "text": "One of the most widely accepted principles in science\u2014Occam\u2019s Razor\u2014is that a good theory should combine conceptual simplicity with explanatory or descriptive power. Albert Einstein expressed it thus: \u201cA theory is more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises, the more different things it relates, and the more expanded its area of application.\u201d30\nIn these terms, Alan Turing\u2019s concept of a \u2018Universal Turing Machine\u2019, and equivalent models such as Post\u2019s [38] \u2018Canonical System\u2019, are undoubtedly good models of \u2018computing\u2019. But notwithstanding Turing\u2019s vision that computers might become intelligent [49], the concept of a Universal Turing Machine, does not tell us how!31 Several decades of research have yielded some useful insights and some impressive applications but I believe it is fair to say that AI has been and is suffering from an excess of narrow subfields and, with some honourable exceptions, insufficient attention to the need to simplify and integrate observations and concepts across different areas.32 Hence the SP programme of research.\nIt is no accident that \u2018simplicity\u2019 and \u2018power\u2019 are also prominent in the SP theory:\n30Quoted in [18, p. 512] 31But Turing began to address that problem in a report about \u201cunorganised\nmachines\u201d [50]. 32Honourable exceptions include research aiming to develop \u201cunified theories of cognition\u201d and \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d.\n\u2022 The two terms, together, are equivalent to \u2018information compression\u2019 (Appendix A.4);\n\u2022 Cosmologist John Barrow has written that \u201cScience is, at root, just the search for compression in the world\u201d [1, p. 247];\n\u2022 And information compression is central in the SP theory (Section A.4).\nB.1 Motivation\nPart of the motivation for developing the SP theory has been to try to overcome the problem of narrow focus and over-specialisation, identified by other authors:\n\u2022 Neisser [34] writes of the need to avoid \u2018microtheories\u2019 in psychology.\n\u2022 In a similar vein, Newell, in his famous essay \u201cYou can\u2019t play 20 questions with nature and win\u201d [35], urges researchers to develop theories with wide scope (pp. 284\u2013289) dealing with \u201ca genuine slab of human behaviour\u201d (p. 303).\n\u2022 Kelly and Hamm, both of IBM, write that \u201cToday, as scientists labor to create machine technologies to augment our senses, there\u2019s a strong tendency to view each sensory field in isolation as specialists focus only on a single sensory capability.

Even within IBM, our specialists in different sensing technologies don\u2019t interact much.\u201d [21, location 1004].\n\u2022 And McCorduck writes \u201cThe goals once articulated with debonair intellectual verve by AI pioneers appeared unreachable ... Subfields broke off\u2014vision, robotics, natural language processing, machine learning, decision theory\u2014to pursue singular goals in solitary splendor, without reference to other kinds of intelligent behaviour.\u201d [31, p. 417]. Later, she writes of \u201cthe rough shattering of AI into subfields ... and these with their own sub-subfields\u2014that would hardly have anything to say to each other for years to come.\u201d (ibid., p. 424). She adds: \u201cWorse, for a variety of reasons, not all of them scientific, each subfield soon began settling for smaller, more modest, and measurable advances, while the grand vision held by AI\u2019s founding fathers, a general machine intelligence, seemed to contract into a negligible, probably impossible dream.\u201d\nB.2 Evaluation of the SP theory in terms of simplicity and power\nAlthough, in comparing one theory with another, we must rely on relatively informal assessments of simplicity and power, the SP theory, in those terms, appears to do well [62, Section 4]:\n\u2022 The key concept of multiple alignment, with associated processes, are, in the SP computer model, expressed in an \u2018exec\u2019 file that requires less than 500 KB of storage space.\n\u2022 The theory has non-trivial things to say about a wide range of observations and concepts in artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, mathematics, and human perception and cognition (Appendix A.7) and it has many potential benefits and applications (Appendix A.8).\nIt appears that the SP theory avoids what are perhaps the two most common pitfalls in the development of scientific theories: it is not an over-simple and over-general, catch-all theory, that explains everything and nothing; and it is not an over-specific theory that merely re-describes the data that it is meant to explain. In short, there appears to be a good balance between simplicity and power as outlined in Appendix A.4.5.\nB.3 If it works, who cares?\nSome people may argue that these concerns are misplaced\u2014that researchers should concentrate on creating things that work and not worry about the development of good theory. It is true that a suck-it-and-see approach can produce useful results and may indeed be helpful in the development of theory. But no theory or bad theory is almost always a handicap: imagine the difficulties of space travel using Ptolemy\u2019s epicycles as a guide, or the impoverishment of biology without an understanding of DNA.\nB.4 Since the human mind is a kluge, why worry about good theory for AI?\nGary Marcus has argued persuasively [29] that, as a result of the way biological evolution builds on what comes to hand, the human mind is, in many respects, a kluge, without the coherence or elegance of a well-designed piece of engineering. Since human perception and cognition is a source of inspiration and a touchstone of success for AI, some people may conclude that we\nneed not worry about good theory for AI. Here are some reasons to think otherwise:\n\u2022 Although it is clear that the human mind has many shortcomings, it also has extraordinary versatility and adaptability. This is still a major challenge for AI, a challenge which appears to demand the development of good theory.\n\u2022 Much progress in science has depended on a willingness to look for simplicity within the apparent complexity of the world, witness Newton\u2019s laws of motion."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "The main aim of this paper is to highlight distinctive features of the SP theory of intelligence and its apparent advantages compared with some AI-related alternatives. The theory is outlined in an appendix, with pointers to where fuller information may be found. The distinctive features and advantages are summarised: simplification and integration of observations and concepts; simplification and integration of structures and processes in computing systems; the SP theory is itself a theory of computing; a central role for information compression via the matching and unification of patterns, and for multiple alignment; transparency in the representation and processing of knowledge; the discovery of \u2018natural\u2019 structures via information compression (DONSVIC); interpretation of aspects of mathematics; interpretation of phenomena in human perception and cognition; realisation of abstract concepts in terms of neurons and their inter-connections (SP-neural). Distinctive features and advantages of the SP system are highlighted in comparison with alternatives: the concept of minimum length encoding and related concepts; deep learning in neural networks; concepts of universal search; Bayesian networks and other models for AI; the analysis and production of natural language; the learning of natural language; exact and inexact forms of reasoning; representation and processing of diverse forms of knowledge; IBM\u2019s Watson; solving problems associated with big data, and in the development of intelligence in autonomous robots.
