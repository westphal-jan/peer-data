This is a unique attempt to simplify and integrate observations and concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, mathematics, and human perception and cognition, with information compression via the matching and unification of patterns as a unifying theme.1\nMany potential benefits and applications flow from this simplification and integration, as detailed in Section 2 and Appendix C. Several of those benefits and applications may be realised on relatively short timescales, as indicated in the introduction to Appendix C.\nThe SP theory was not dreamed up overnight. It is the product of about 20 years of development and testing.\n1The name \u201cSP\u201d is short for Simplicity and Power, because compression of any given body of information, I, may be seen as a process of reducing \u201credundancy\u201d of information in I and thus increasing its \u201csimplicity\u201d, whilst retaining as much as possible of its non-redundant descriptive and explanatory \u201cpower\u201d.\nA central idea in the SP theory is the powerful concept of multiple alignment, borrowed and adapted from that concept in bioinformatics, and outlined in Appendix A.3.2. It appears that multiple alignment provides a key to versatility and adaptability in intelligent systems.\nExpressing the theory in a computer model has helped to reduce vagueness in the theory, it has provided a means of testing candidate ideas\u2014many of which have been rejected as a result of this testing\u2014and it is a means of demonstrating what can be done with the system.\nThere is an outline of the SP theory and the SP computer model in Appendix A, with pointers to where fuller information may be found. Distinctive features and apparent advantages of the SP system are summarised in Appendix B. Some of the potential benefits and applications of the SP system are summarised in Section 2 and Appendix C, with pointers to more comprehensive sources of information.\nThe wide scope of the SP system, and the wide range of its potential benefits and applications, means that there are many more avenues to be explored than could be tackled by any one research group. Hence the need for SPF. It is intended to facilitate large-scale collaboration, very much in the spirit of:\n\u201cThe creation of this new era of [cognitive] computing is a monumental endeavor ... no company can take on this challenge alone. So we look to our clients, university researchers, government policy makers, industry partners, and entrepreneurs\u2014indeed the entire tech industry\u2014to take this journey with us.\u201d [6, Preface].\nand\n\u201c... fund activities that support integration and collaboration within the research community; for instance, CPPs [Collaborative Computational Projects], consortia, networks, international interactions.\u201d2"}, {"heading": "1.2 Presentation", "text": "In what follows, we\u2019ll first describe some motivations for creating SPF (Section 2).

In broad terms, this concept provides a key to:\n\u2022 Simplification of concepts and systems. Diverse concepts in computing and cognition may be assimilated to the relatively simple concept of multiple alignment ([19], [26, Section2 and 4]), and that concept can mean substantial simplifications of computing systems ([19, Section 4.4.2], [26, Section 5]).\n\u2022 Versatility in intelligence. The SP system has strengths in unsupervised learning, natural language processing, pattern recognition, information retrieval, several kinds of reasoning, planning, problem solving, information compression, and more [19, 21].\n\u2022 Adaptability in intelligence. The SP system\u2019s strengths in unsupervised learning [19, Chapter 9] may provide a foundation for other kinds of learning [23, Section V]. Via unsupervised learning, and perhaps via other kinds of learning, the system has potential to promote human-like adaptability in intelligence.\n\u2022 Seamless integration of structures and functions. The SP system, with multiple alignment centre stage, has potential to promote seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence [26, Section 7], an integration that appears to be essential for effective reasoning and problem solving in intelligent systems.\nMore specifically, there are many potential benefits and applications that flow from the multiple alignment concept, described in outline in Appendix C and in more detail in [19, 26, 24, 23, 20, 18]. As noted in Section 2.6, the potential value, worldwide, of those benefits and application, has been estimated to be at least $190 billion, every year.\nThe estimated cost of setting up SPF is \u00a3634, 700 and recurrent costs are estimated to be \u00a3173, 800 pa (Section 4).\nTaking account of these estimated costs, and the potential benefits and applications, it appears that the proposed facility would be a good investment."}, {"heading": "2.2 UK industrial strategy", "text": "The development of SPF would chime well with the goal of \u201csupporting emerging technologies\u201d, one of five main themes in the UK\u2019s industrial strategy.3\nMore specifically, the SPF fits well with the Government\u2019s \u201cinformation economy strategy\u201d,4 and its focus on \u201ceight \u2018great technologies\u2019 which will propel the UK to future growth\u201d:5\nThe SP system has considerable potential to contribute to development of two of those \u201cgreat technologies\u201d\u2014big data (discussed in the next subsection) and robotics and autonomous systems (discussed in Section 2.4). The SP system is also relevant to development in a third area\u2014energy\u2014discussed briefly in Section 2.5).\nIn addition, the very broad scope of the SP system (Section 2.1), and the provision of a facility for researchers anywhere in the world (Section 3.4), is likely, via synergies of various kinds, encourage \u201cbetter science\u201d, \u201cnew kinds of science\u201d, and \u201cinterdisciplinary projects\u201d, in keeping with the Government\u2019s A Strategic Vision for UK e-Infrastructure.6"}, {"heading": "2.3 Big data", "text": "Outlined here are some significant challenges associated with big data and how the SP system may help to overcome them."}, {"heading": "2.3.1 Challenges", "text": "There is a tendency amongst some people to write or speak as if big data was an unalloyed blessing and that all the necessary technologies are available to exploit it. But it is clear from the book Smart Machines by John Kelly and Steve Hamm (both of IBM) [6], and also from Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis from the US National Research Council [9], that much of the potential value of big data cannot be realised currently because of significant unsolved problems in that area.\nIt is also clear from Smart Machines that significant problems associated with big data cannot be solved by tinkering with existing designs for computers.

Three of those problems, and their potential solutions, are highlighted here:\n\u2022 The problem of variety in big data. There is a pressing need in computing to tame the great variety of formalisms and formats for the representation of knowledge, each with their own mode of processing. The multiple alignment framework in the SP system has clear potential as a universal framework for the representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge (UFK) [24, Section III].\n\u2022 Energy consumption. The SP system, in conjunction with the concept of \u201cdata-centric computing\u201d [6, Chapter 5], has potential to \u201cmake computers many orders of magnitude more energy efficient\u201d [6, p. 88] via two key principles [24, Section IX]: 1) Taking advantage of statistical information that the system gathers as a by-product of how it works; 2) Cutting out much searching by making direct connections between \u201cneural symbols\u201d in \u201cSP-neural\u201d (Appendix A.6).\n\u2022 Transmission of information. The SP system has potential to yield dramatic economies in the transmission of information, partly by making big data smaller [24, Section VII], but perhaps more importantly via analysis/synthesis [11, Chapter 18], based on the judicious separation of encoding and grammar [24, Section VIII].\nAs noted in Appendix C.13.1, it appears that, considering the nine proposed solutions collectively, and in several cases individually, there are no alternatives that can rival the potential of what is described in [24].\nWith regard to the Government\u2019s information economy strategy,7 \u201cThe UK\n7Information Economy Strategy (PDF), June 2013, bit.ly/1d5tn8h.\nnow has the opportunity to take a lead in the global efforts to deal with the volume, velocity and variety of data created each day. This will require continued infrastructure investment ...\u201d (p. 7). SPF has potential to be a major plank in that infrastructure, and at modest cost (Section 4)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Robotics and autonomous systems", "text": "As mentioned above, robotics and autonomous systems is another of the Government\u2019s \u201ceight great technologies\u201d where the SP system may make a contribution\u2014 perhaps via the UK Robotics and Autonomous Systems Network (UK-RAS Network)8 or otherwise\u2014and the potential is considerable.\nIn the paper Autonomous robots and the SP theory of intelligence [23], robots are \u201cautonomous\u201d if they do not depend on external intelligence or power supplies, and are mobile. It is also assumed that they are designed to exhibit as much human-like intelligence as possible. The paper describes how the SP system may contribute in three main areas:\n\u2022 Computational efficiency, the use of energy, and the size and weight of computers. \u201cTo field a conventional computer with [human-like] cognitive capacity would require gigawatts of electricity and a machine the size of a football field.\u201d [6, p. 75]. If a robot is to be autonomous as described above, it needs a \u2018brain\u2019 that is efficient enough to do all the necessary processing without external assistance, does not require an industrial-scale power station to meet its energy demands, and is small enough and light enough to be carried around\u2014things that are difficult or impossible to achieve with current technologies.\nSection III of [23] describes how these things may be achieved in a revised and updated version of arguments in [24, Section IX]. The SP system may help: by reducing the size of data to be processed; by exploiting statistical information that the system gathers as an integral part of how it works; and via a revised version of Donald Hebb\u2019s [5] concept of a \u201ccell assembly\u201d.\n\u2022 Towards human-like versatility in intelligence. If a robot is to operate successfully in an environment where people cannot help, or where such opportunities are limited, it needs as much as possible of the versatility in intelligence that people may otherwise provide.\nThe SP system demonstrates versatility via its strengths in areas such as unsupervised learning, natural language processing, fuzzy pattern recognition\n8See, for example, \u201cWidespread backing for UK robotics network\u201d, The Engineer, 2015-06-24, bit.ly/1BR9qE2.\nand recognition at multiple levels of abstraction, best-match and semantic forms of information retrieval, several kinds of reasoning, planning, problem solving, information compression, and more [23, Section IV].\nBut the SP system is not simply a kludge of different AI functions. Owing to its focus on simplification and integration of concepts in computing and cognition (Appendix A), it promises to reduce or eliminate unnecessary complexity and to avoid awkward incompatibilities between poorly-integrated subsystems, as indicated in Appendix C.1.\n\u2022 Towards human-like adaptability in intelligence. The SP system\u2019s strengths in unsupervised learning and other aspects of intelligence may help to achieve human-like adaptability in intelligence via: one-trial learning; the learning of natural language; learning to see; building 3D models of objects and of a robot\u2019s surroundings; learning regularities in the workings of a robot and in the robot\u2019s environment; exploration and play; learning major skills; and learning via demonstration [23, Section V].\nThis new approach to the development of autonomous robots has several distinctive features (Appendix B), especially the concept of multiple alignment. It appears that this approach has considerable potential to promote computational and energy efficiency in a robot\u2019s brain, and to achieve human-like versatility and adaptability in intelligence."}, {"heading": "2.5 Energy", "text": "The SP system may also contribute indirectly to another of the areas identified as one of the \u201ceight great technologies\u201d\u2014energy\u2014via increases in efficiency in the workings of computers and in the transmission of data, as outlined in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, and described more fully in [24, Sections VIII and IX] and also in [23, Section III]."}, {"heading": "2.6 Other potential benefits and applications of the SP", "text": "system\nIn addition to big data (Section 2.3), robotics and autonomous systems (Section 2.4), and energy (Section 2.5), there are several other potential benefits and applications of the SP system, outlined in Appendix C. As noted there, several of these potential benefits and applications may be realised on relatively short timescales with existing high-performance computers or even ordinary computers.\nPeer-reviewed papers about potential benefits and applications that have not already been mentioned include [22] (application of the SP theory to the understanding of natural vision and the development of computer vision), [18] (application of the SP system to medical diagnosis), and [20] (the SP system as an intelligent database), and [26] (several other potential benefits and applications including unsupervised learning, natural language processing, pattern recognition, software engineering, information compression, the semantic web, bioinfomatics, data fusion, simplification of computing systems, and the seamless integration of structures and functions in diverse kinds of knowledge).\nIn view of the wide scope of the SP system, and evidence of its potential, it seems reasonable to estimate that it could add at least 5% to the value of IT investments, worldwide. Since these are about $3.8 trillion annually,9 the value of the SP concepts, every year, would be at least $190 billion!

As noted in Section 2.6, a conservative estimate of the potential value of the SP concepts is at least $190 billion, every year.\n\u2022 Social. As already noted, there are many potential benefits and applications of the SP system, some of them outlined in Sections 2.3 to 2.6, and in Appendix C.\n\u2022 Environmental. The SP concepts have potential to deliver more for less\u2014 with consequent environmental benefits\u2014via a combination of: 1) gains in economic and social impact (as just noted); 2) reductions in energy consumption and in the size and weight of computers (Sections 2.3.2 and 2.4).12\n\u2022 Academic. We expect the establishment of SPF, with associated publicity, to encourage and facilitate contributions by research groups and individual researchers all around the world. Given the wide scope of the SP system and the wide range of its potential benefits and applications, the academic impact of SPF is potentially very large. Research that is done with SPF may be seen as a \u2018dividend\u2019 from the investment. From the perspective of the UK, research that is done by research groups and individual researchers outside the UK may be seen as a bonus, additional to what would be achieved if the facility were restricted to UK researchers. In addition, there are likely to be benefits arising from synergies and large-scale collaboration (Section 2.2).\nInitially, we aim to raise awareness of the facility amongst researchers and to encourage relevant research projects. But later, we expect that research with the facility will develop its own momentum.\n\u2022 Publicity. As a condition for using SPF, researchers would be asked to ensure that every relevant publication in an academic journal, collection of academic papers, or conference proceedings, contains an acknowledgement of the facility and of the body or bodies that have provided the necessary funds.

SPF will be accessed via a well-designed website, with user-friendly interfaces for each part of the system, using multimedia where appropriate. It would be best if users did not have to download and install any software. Any such downloading of software can probably be avoided by developing the user interface using the facilities of HTML5.

There will be procedures for the registration of each user, assigning a unique identifier and setting up facilities for each account.15\nHere, a \u201cuser\u201d will be a research group or an individual researcher. To avoid undue complications, at least initially, each research group will be treated as if it was an individual researcher, with no attempt to differentiate individual researchers within each group, or their work. Each research group would need to make its own arrangements for the division of labour within the group.\nIt is likely that most of the necessary mechanisms are already established for registering users of the host machine.\n\u2022 Creating new versions of the SP machine. Any user may create one or more new versions of SPM:\n\u2013 Each such version will have its own storage space with documentation, source files, executable files, data files, and so on.\n14See, for example, \u201cGoogle search changes will promote mobile-friendly sites\u201d, BBC News, 2015-04-20, bbc.in/1Q9AORA.\n15As noted in Section 2.9, each user would be asked to ensure that, in all academic publications arising from research with SPF, there would be an acknowledgement of the facility and of the body or bodies that have provided the necessary funds.\n\u2013 There will an hierarchical scheme of the usual kind for the identifiers of different versions, with identifier(s) for the creator(s) of each version.\n\u2013 The documentation should make clear the origins of each version in one or more previous versions, which may include SPM1 or other versions by the same user or other users.\n\u2013 Any version of SPM will be in one of two states: \u201cunder development\u201d or \u201ccompleted\u201d. Once a version has been \u201ccompleted\u201d, further modifications will not be allowed. The executable code of any completed version may be run by any other user (next).\n\u2022 Running the SP machine. Any version of SPM that is under development may be run by the user that is developing it. Any completed version of SPM may be run by any user, which would of course include the user that created it. For any user to run any given version of SPM, facilities will be needed for:\n\u2013 Assigning an area of storage to hold data and results.\n\u2013 Setting parameters for the given version of SPM.\n\u2013 Creating and editing SP patterns.\n\u2013 Uploading SP patterns that have been created elsewhere.\n\u2013 Online debugging of software (for SPM versions that are under development). It is likely that a suitable debugger is already established on the host machine.\n\u2013 Viewing results, including multiple alignments and grammars created by the program. Since some results\u2014multiple alignments in particular\u2014may be larger than can be seen comfortably on a typical computer screen, there should be facilities for zooming and scrolling.\n\u2013 Downloading SP patterns, included those newly-created by the given version of SPM.\n\u2022 SP-neural, version 1. Alongside SPM1 will be a first, tentative, version of the SP-neural machine, which may be referred to as \u201cSPNRL1\u201d. The main elements of the SP-neural facility will be:\n\u2013 As with SPM, each user may create one or more versions of SPNRL.\n\u2013 SPNRL1 will have a means of translating a set of SP patterns (or one or more multiple alignments) into an inter-connected set of pattern assemblies. With the object-oriented facilities of C++, there will be a class for neurons and a class for pattern assemblies.\n\u2013 In this preliminary model, each SP symbol will be represented by a single neuron although it is likely that in living brains, neural \u201csymbols\u201d are realised with clusters of inter-connected neurons.\n\u2013 Connections between neurons will be represented with C++ pointers. As SPNRL is developed, it is likely that there will be excitatory connections and also inhibitory connections, in accordance with what is known about neural tissue. It is also likely that there will be lateral connections between neighbouring neurons within each pattern assembly.\n\u2013 There will be a means of displaying, in graphical form, a set of interconnected neurons and pattern assemblies, much as in Figure 4.\n\u2013 For any given set of inter-connected neurons and pattern assemblies, there will be a means of downloading it as a set of SP patterns.\n\u2013 As SPNRL is developed:\n\u2217 There will be a means of sending excitatory and inhibitory signals through inter-connected pattern assemblies and displaying the results in terms of the excitatory levels of individual neurons. \u2217 There will a means of creating new pattern assemblies and learning neural \u2018grammars\u2019, in accordance with learning processes in any given version of SPM. \u2217 Parallel processing will be applied to mimic the high levels of parallelism that exist in the workings of real neural tissue."}, {"heading": "3.3 The facility should be permanent", "text": "For reasons that follow, SPF should be permanent in the sense that it should be available for the foreseeable future:\n\u2022 Bridging the \u2018Valley of Death\u2019.

We envisage the proposed facility providing the basis for research that is likely to include long-term research programmes. Any research group that wishes to embark on that kind of research programme needs to have confidence that the research facility will not be withdrawn. Without assurance for researchers that the facility is permanent, it is likely that the entire project will fail.\n\u2013 BIS: software as a sustained infrastructure in the long term. \u201cCurrent investments in software development should be reviewed with a view to developing models of support for software as a sustained infrastructure in the long term, as opposed to being supported by significant one off investments.\u201d17\n\u2013 e-Science Institute: the need for long-term funding for ambitious software development projects. \u201cThere needs to be long-term funding for ambitious software development projects .... The current approach is hardware centric and short-term ..., but does not recognise the critical and long-term role that software and people play in the [research computing] enterprise.\u201d18\n\u2022 Time to develop research programmes. It is likely to take time for a research group to learn about the SP system, to decide to mount a research project, to prepare a research proposal, for the proposal to be assessed, to provide PCs and other facilities, and to recruit staff. If the proposed research facility is only available for a few years (bearing in mind the time needed to create the facility), much of that time may be taken up with the processes described. Then it is likely that there would be little or no time left to do the actual research.\n\u2022 Consistency across facilities. In the same way that large and expensive facilities\u2014large telescopes, atom smashers, supercomputers, and the like\u2014 are maintained for many years, and replaced as necessary, the same should apply to less expensive or smaller-scale facilities. In both cases, research benefits from the long-term perspective that stability makes possible.\n\u2022 Archival status. As outlined in Section 3.2, the facility will be designed so that research groups and individual researchers may create their own versions of the SP machine. Each such version needs to have archival status:\n17From p. 8 in \u201cReport of the e-Infrastructure Advisory Group\u201d, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, June 2011, bit.ly/1LMXOSD.\n18Recommendations #4 and #5, p. 17, in \u201cStrategy for the UK Research Computing Ecosystem\u201d, The e-Science Institute at The University of Edinburgh, October 2011, bit.ly/1KslhrQ.\n\u2013 The need for long-term access to and execution of software. Other researchers, now and in the future, need to be able to access the source code and documentation for any version of the SP machine and to run the executable code. Naturally, the host machine for SPF may need to be replaced from time to time. In any such case, SPF, including all associated projects and data, may be ported on to the replacement machine, in accordance with standard practice in industry and commerce.\n\u2013 RCUK: software as a vital research infrastructure. The need for longterm preservation of software and associated computing systems is implied by:\u201cSoftware developed for experimental facilities and instrumentation, modelling and simulation and data-analysis is a critical and valuable resource. Software and algorithm development represents major investments by skilled researchers, and the large suite of codes and algorithms used in research should be regarded as a vital research infrastructure, requiring support and maintenance along the innovation chain, and throughout its life cycle. The reproducibility of research is at the very heart of the scientific method.\u201d19.\n\u2013 Long-term preservation of software. This requirement accords with the trend for academic journals to allow the author or authors of any published paper to provide supplementary material, which may include data, software, and things that may be regarded as forms of software, such as MP4 files.20 It is increasingly recognised that many bodies of software should have the same archival status as peer-reviewed papers in academic journals or conference proceedings, and bodies of data on which those papers are based.\n\u2013 Preserving the execution environment. Since software will often not run, or will not run correctly, unless it is running on the type of computer (with its operating system and related software) for which it was written, there is also a need for long-term preservation of each type of computer.

The case has also been argued by computer scientists at Cambridge University who \u201chave set a new gold standard for openness and reproducibility in research by sharing the more than 200GB of data and 20,000 lines of code behind their latest results\u2014an unprecedented degree of openness in a peer-reviewed publication.\u201d22 \u2217 Maintaining access to digitised information. The need to maintain access to digitised information in the face of changes in the hardware or software environment that it needs is discussed in \u201cPreserving the digital record of computing history\u201d.23\nAs noted above, replacement of SPF\u2019s host machine should not be a problem. The system may be ported onto any new machine, as or when that becomes necessary.\n\u2022 Avoiding waste and gaining full value from SPF. Given that the bulk of the cost of SPF is in its initial development and setting up, there is little scope for saving money by terminating the facility within a few years. Indeed, any such move is likely to mean a waste of resources and a failure to gain full value from the facility:\n\u2013 The damaging effect of short-termism. As noted above, it is likely that the entire project will fail unless researchers have confidence that the facility is permanent.\n\u2013 Loss of valuable research. Premature termination of SPF would mean losses of valuable research that may otherwise accrue, much of it provided at no cost to the UK by researchers elsewhere (Sections 2.9 and 3.5).\n21BBC News, 2015-02-13, bbc.in/1D3pemp 22\u201cNew gold standard established for open and reproducible research\u201d, Cambridge\nUniversity press release, 2015-05-04, bit.ly/1IgFkKG. 23Article by David Anderson in Communications of the ACM, vol. 58, no. 7, July 2015, pp. 29\u201331.\n\u2013 SPF will not wear out and its value will increase. Unlike ordinary research facilities such as space telescopes or atom smashers, SPF will not wear out.

Accordingly, we are are aiming to create a facility for research groups and individual researchers anywhere in the world. It should not be restricted to UK scientists:\n\u2022 This accords with what John Kelly and Steve Hamm say about the need for large-scale collaboration (quoted in Section 1.1) and also with the need for integration of e-infrastructures \u201cinternationally, across other national einfrastructures, to deliver end-to-end services in the global environment of collaborative research\u201d24 and the need to facilitate \u201c... research collaboration between industry and academia.\u201d25\n\u2022 It also accords with the principles that:\n\u2013 The EPSRC aims to \u201cUnderstand the whole UK e-infrastructure landscape, view it holistically and consider it within an international context (emphasis added).\u201d26\n\u2013 \u201cThe UKs Research and Innovation e-infrastructure needs to be led and driven to deliver a UK wide vision for research e-infrastructure, embedded in the international context essential to todays research challenges.\u201d (emphasis added).27\n\u2022 Opening up the research in this way is likely to yield synergies that might not arise if there were more restrictions (Section 2.2)\u2014with corresponding benefits for UK researchers.\n24p. 2 in E-infrastructure roadmap, Research Councils UK, bit.ly/1Jx59EE. 25ibid., p. 5. 26The EPSRC \u201cE-Infrastructure Roadmap\u201d, retrieved 2015-07-01, bit.ly/1R3V767. 27\u201cReport of the e-Infrastructure Advisory Group\u201d, Department of Business, Innovation and\nSkills, June 2011, p. 3, bit.ly/1LMXOSD.\n\u2022 The international perspective will help to achieve full value from the facility (Section 2.1).\n\u2022 And it will help to increase the impact of the facility (Section 2.9) and its international influence (Section 2.10)."}, {"heading": "3.5 The facility should be easy to access and easy to use", "text": "In keeping with the main points in the preceding subsection, it is important to minimise obstacles to the use of the system for preliminary investigations, for teaching students, for individual research projects, and for long-term research programmes. An additional reason is that, for any research group or individual researcher that is not already familiar with the SP concepts, a significant amount of time and effort is likely to be required to get up to speed, so it is important to minimise other obstacles to progress.\nFor these reasons:\n\u2022 Ease of access. The process of registering with the system and gaining access to it should be as simple and straightforward as possible.\n\u2022 User friendly. For all aspects and parts of the system, there should be a user-friendly interface.\n\u2022 Free at the point of use. With few if any exceptions, the system should be free for users. In addition to minimising obstacles for researchers, reasons include:\n\u2013 Research dividends. In keeping with remarks about research \u2018dividend\u2019 in Section 2.9, the overall value of research done with SPF is likely to outweigh the cost of providing and maintaining the facility, and by a considerable margin.\n\u2013 Research bonuses. As noted in Section 2.9, research that is done by research groups and individual researchers outside the UK may be seen as a bonus, additional to what would be achieved if the facility were restricted to UK researchers.\n\u2013 Research synergies.

These costs may be met from a variety of sources, perhaps including funds for the support of researchers based in the UK.\n\u2022 Running costs. Although it is likely that mature versions of SPM will be used for computationally-demanding tasks, we believe that much research with SPF can be done with small examples that make small computational demands on the host computer, and that the associated costs would be relatively small. It seems likely that the cost of administering a system of charges for running costs would outweigh the actual costs. In that case, it would be best, probably, not to attempt to make any charges for the use of the system.

This may be achieved via the following main routes, each one with associated costs:\n\u2022 Via papers in academic journals and conference proceedings. Most of these would be prepared by research groups and individual researchers that are using SPF, and they would pay the associated costs. But, in addition, there would be academic papers about SPF and SPM, prepared by the two authors of this proposal and staff recruited to develop SPF. The main costs here would be the costs of attending conferences and charges for open-access publication.\n\u2022 The proposers, and perhaps development staff as well, may travel to give talks about SPF and the SP concepts.\n\u2022 Perhaps via conferences (online or traditional) dedicated to research using SPF.

In the theory, information compression is the mechanism both for the learning and organisation of knowledge and for pattern recognition, reasoning, problem solving, and more.\nThe subsections that follow outline the main elements of the SP theory and the SP machine."}, {"heading": "A.1 The SP computer model and the SP machine", "text": "The SP theory is realised in the form of a computer model, SP71, which may be regarded as a version of the SP machine.\nAs noted in the Introduction, the use of a computer model as a vehicle for the theory has helped to reduce vagueness in the theory, it has provided a means of testing candidate ideas, many of which have been rejected, and it is a means of demonstrating what can be done with the system.\nAn outline of how the SP computer model works may be found in [19, Section 3.9], with more detail, including pseudocode, in [19, Sections 3.10 and 9.2].28 Fully commented source code for the SP71 computer model may be downloaded via a link near the bottom of www.cognitionresearch.org/sp.htm, and via \u201cAncillary files\u201d under www.arxiv.org/abs/1306.3888.\nAs previously noted, we envisage that the SP computer model will be the basis for the creation of the high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine. How things may develop is shown schematically in Figure 1.\n28These sources describe SP70, a slightly earlier version of the model than SP71 but quite similar to it. The description of SP70 includes a description, in [19, Sections 3.9.1 and 3.10], of a subset of the SP70 model called SP61."}, {"heading": "A.2 Patterns and symbols", "text": "In the SP system, knowledge is represented with arrays of atomic symbols in one or two dimensions called patterns. The SP71 model works with 1D patterns but it is envisaged that the system will be generalised to work with 2D patterns [21, Section 3.3].\nAn \u2018atomic symbol\u2019 in the SP system is simply a mark that can be matched with any other symbol to determine whether it is the same or different: no other result is permitted.\nIn themselves, SP patterns are not particularly expressive. But within the multiple alignment framework (Appendix A.3.2), they support the representation and processing of a wide variety of kinds of knowledge (Appendix A.4). A goal of the SP research programme is to establish one system for the representation and processing of all kinds of knowledge (see also [24, Section III]). Evidence to date suggests that this may be achieved with SP patterns in the multiple alignment framework.\nAny collection of SP patterns is termed a grammar. Although that term is most closely associated with linguistics, it is used in the SP research programme for a collection of SP patterns describing any kind of knowledge.\nA.3 Information compression\nIn the SP theory, the emphasis on information compression derives from earlier research on grammatical inference [16] and the principle of minimum length encoding (MLE) [12, 15, 10]).\nAt an abstract level, information compression means the detection and reduction of redundancy in information. In more concrete terms, redundancy means recurrent patterns, regularities, structures, and associations, including causal associations. Thus information compression provides a means of discovering such things as words in natural language [16], objects [23, Section V-E], and associations (see, for example, [24, Section III-A.1]), in accordance with the DONSVIC principle [21, Section 5.2].29\nThe default assumption in the SP theory is that compression of information is always lossless, meaning that all non-redundant information is retained. In particular applications, there may be a case for discarding non-redundant information (see, for example, [24, Section X-B]) but any such discard is reversible.\nIn the SP system, information compression is achieved via the matching and unification of patterns. More specifically, it is achieved via the building of multiple alignments and via the unsupervised learning of grammars. These three things are described briefly in the following three subsections.\n29DONSVIC = \u201cThe discovery of natural structures via information compression\u201d.\nA.3.1 Information compression via the matching and unification of patterns\nThe basis for information compression in the SP system is a process of searching for patterns that match each other with a process of merging or \u2018unifying\u2019 patterns that are the same. At the heart of the SP71 model is a method for finding good full and partial matches between sequences with advantages compared with classical methods [19, Appendix A].30\nA.3.2 Information compression via the building of multiple alignments\nThat process for finding good full and partial matches between patterns is the foundation for processes that build multiple alignments like the one shown in Figure 3. This concept is similar to multiple alignment in bioinformatics but with important differences [19, Section 3.4]. It is a powerful and distinctive feature of the SP system.\n30The main advantages are [19, Section 3.10.3.1]: 1) That it can match arbitrarily long sequences without excessive demands on memory; 2) For any two sequences, it can find a set of alternative matches (each with a measure of how good it is) instead of a single \u2018best\u2019 match; 3) The \u2018depth\u2019 or thoroughness of the searching can be controlled by parameters.\nThis example shows the best multiple alignment created by the SP computer model when a set of New patterns (in column 0)31 is processed in conjunction with a set of pre-existing Old patterns like those shown in columns 1 to 6. Here, the multiple alignment is \u2018best\u2019 because it is the one that achieves the most economical description of the New patterns in terms of the Old patterns. The way in which that description or \u2018encoding\u2019 is derived from a multiple alignment is explained in [19, Section 3.5] and [21, Section 4.1]. Like all other kinds of knowledge, encodings derived from multiple alignments are recorded using SP patterns (Appendix A.2).\nThis multiple alignment may be interpreted as the result of a process of recognition (Appendix C.5). The New patterns represent the features of some unknown plant and the Old patterns in columns 1 to 6 show how the plant has been identified at several levels of abstraction: species \u2018Meadow Buttercup\u2019 (column 1), genus Ranunculus (column 6), family Ranunculaceae (column 5), and so on.\nA.3.3 Information compression via the unsupervised learning of grammars\nAs outlined in [19, Section 3.9.2] and [21, Section 5.1], and described more fully in [19, Chapter 9], the SP system may, without assistance from a \u201cteacher\u201d or anything equivalent, derive one or more plausible grammars from a body of New patterns, with minimum length encoding as a guiding principle. In that process, multiple alignment has a central role as a source of SP patterns for possible inclusion in any grammar [23, Section V-B1]."}, {"heading": "A.3.4 Heuristic search", "text": "Like most problems in artificial intelligence, each of the afore-mentioned problems\u2014finding good full and partial matches between patterns, finding or constructing good multiple alignments, and inferring one or more good grammars from a body of data\u2014is normally too complex to be solved by exhaustive search.\nWith intractable problems like these, it is often assumed that the goal is to find theoretically ideal solutions. But with these and most other AI problems, \u201cThe best is the enemy of the good\u201d. By scaling back one\u2019s ambitions and searching for \u201creasonably good\u201d solutions, it is often possible to find solutions that are useful, and without undue computational demands.\nAs with other AI applications, and as with the building of multiple alignments in bioinformatics, the SP71 model uses heuristic techniques in all three cases men-\n31Specifically, the New patterns in this example are \u2018has chlorophyll\u2019 (a pattern with one symbol), \u2018<stem> hairy </stem>\u2019, \u2018<petals> yellow </petals>\u2019, \u2018<stamens> numerous </stamens>\u2019, and \u2018<habitat> meadows </habitat>\u2019. The patterns in a set like that may be presented to the system and processed in any order.\ntioned above. This means searching for solutions in stages, with a pruning of the search tree at every stage, guided by measures of success [19, Appendix A; Sections 3.9 and 3.10; Chapter 9]. With these kinds of techniques, acceptably good approximate solutions can normally be found without excessive computational demands and with \u201cbig O\u201d values that are within acceptable limits.\nA.4 Multiple alignment and the representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge\nThe expressive power of SP patterns within the multiple alignment framework derives in large part from the way that symbols in one pattern may serve as links to one or more other patterns or parts thereof. One of several examples in Figure 3 is how the pair of symbols \u2018<family> ... </family>\u2019 in column 6 serves to identify the pattern \u2018<family> ... Ranunculales ... <hermaphrodite> ... poisonous ... </family>\u2019 in column 5.\nIn the figure, these kinds of linkages between patterns mean that the unknown plant (with characteristics shown in column 0) may be recognised at several different levels within a hierarchy of classes: genus, family, order, class, and so on. Although it is not shown in this example, the system also supports cross classification.\nIn the figure, the parts and sub-parts of the plant are shown in such structures as \u2018<shoot>\u2019 (column 3), \u2018<flowers>\u2019 (column 5), \u2018<petals>\u2019 (column 6), and so on.\nAs in conventional systems for object-oriented design, the system provides for inheritance of attributes (Appendix C.8). But unlike such systems, there is smooth integration of class hierarchies and part-whole hierarchies, without awkward inconsistencies [20, Section 4.2.1].\nMore generally, SP patterns within the multiple alignment framework provide for the representation and processing of a wide variety of kinds of knowledge including: the syntax and semantics of natural language; class hierarchies and part-whole hierarchies (as just described); networks and trees; entity-relationship structures; relational knowledge; rules and several kinds of reasoning; patterns and pattern recognition; images; structures in three dimensions; and procedural knowledge. There is a summary in [24, Section III-B], and more detail in Appendix C.\nA.5 Information compression, prediction, and probabilities\nOwing to the close connection between information compression and concepts of prediction and probability [8], the SP system is fundamentally probabilistic.32 Each SP pattern has an associated frequency of occurrence and probabilities may be calculated for each multiple alignment and for any inference that may be drawn from any given multiple alignment.\nAlthough the SP system is fundamentally probabilistic: it can be constrained to answer only those kinds of questions where probabilities are close to 0 or 1; and, via the use of error-reducing redundancy, it can deliver decisions with high levels of confidence. Contrary to what one may suppose, there is no conflict between the use of error-reducing redundancy and the notion that \u201ccomputing\u201d may be understood as information compression\u2014the two things are independent, as described in [19, Section 2.3.7]."}, {"heading": "A.6 SP-neural", "text": "Part of the SP theory is the idea, described most fully in [19, Chapter 11], that the abstract concepts of symbol and pattern in the SP theory may be realised more concretely in the brain with collections of neurons in the cerebral cortex.\nThe neural equivalent of an SP pattern is called a pattern assembly. The word \u201cassembly\u201d has been adopted in this term because the concept is quite similar to Donald Hebb\u2019s [5] concept of a cell assembly. The main difference is that the concept of pattern assembly is unambiguously explicit in proposing that the sharing of structure between two or more pattern assemblies is achieved by means of \u2018references\u2019 from one structure to another, as described and discussed in [19, Section 11.4.1]).\nIt is pertinent to mention that unsupervised learning in the SP theory ([19, Chapter 9], [21, Section 5]) is quite different from \u201cHebbian learning\u201d as described by Hebb [5] and widely adopted in the kinds of artificial neural networks that are popular in computer science.33 By contrast with Hebbian learning, the SP system, like a person, may learn from a single exposure to some situation or event. And, by contrast with Hebbian learning, it takes time to learn a language in the SP\n32There are reasons to believe that the same is true of \u201ccomputing\u201d at its most fundamental level, and also mathematics. For example, Gregory Chaitin has written \u201cI have recently been able to take a further step along the path laid out by Go\u0308del and Turing. By translating a particular computer program into an algebraic equation of a type that was familiar even to the ancient Greeks, I have shown that there is randomness in the branch of pure mathematics known as number theory. My work indicates that\u2014to borrow Einsteins metaphor\u2014God sometimes plays dice with whole numbers.\u201d [4, p. 80].\n33See, for example, \u201cHebbian theory\u201d, Wikipedia, bit.ly/1sW6ATt, retrieved 2014-12-19.\nsystem because of the complexity of the search space, not because of any kind of gradual strengthening or \u201cweighting\u201d of links between neurons [19, Section 11.4.4].\nFigure 4 shows schematically how pattern assemblies may be represented and inter-connected with neurons. Here, each pattern assembly, such as \u2018< NP < D > < N > >\u2019, is represented by the sequence of atomic symbols of the corresponding SP pattern. Each atomic symbol, such as \u2018<\u2019 or \u2018NP\u2019, would be represented in the pattern assembly by one neuron or a small group of inter-connected neurons.34 Apart from the inter-connections amongst pattern assemblies, the cortex in SPneural is somewhat like a sheet of paper on which knowledge may be written in the form of neurons.\nIt is envisaged that any pattern assembly may be \u2018recognised\u2019 if it receives more excitatory inputs than rival pattern assemblies, perhaps via a winner-takesall mechanism [19, Section 11.3.4]. And, once recognised, any pattern assembly may itself be a source of excitatory signals leading to the recognition of higher-level pattern assemblies."}, {"heading": "B Distinctive features and apparent advantages", "text": "of the SP system\nInformation compression and concepts of probability are themes in other research, including research on Bayesian inference, Kolmogorov complexity, deep learning, artificial neural networks, minimum length encoding, unified theories of cognition, natural language processing and more. The main features that distinguish the SP system from these other areas of research, and apparent advantages compared with these other approaches, are described quite fully in \u201cThe SP theory of intelligence: its distinctive features and advantages\u201d [27]. The main points are summarised here:\n\u2022 Simplification and integration of observations and concepts. As mentioned above, the SP theory is a unique attempt to simplify and integrate observations and concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, mathematics, and human perception and cognition. The canvass is much broader than it is, for example, in \u201cunified theories of cognition\u201d. It has quite a lot to say, for example, about the nature of mathematics [17], [19, Chapter 10], [25].\n\u2022 Simplification and integration of computing systems. The provision of one simple format for knowledge, and one framework\u2014multiple alignment\u2014for\n34Not shown in the figure are lateral connections within each pattern assembly and inhibitory connections elsewhere, as outlined in [19, Sections 11.3.3 and 11.3.4].\nthe representation and processing of knowledge, promote an overall simplification of computing systems, including both hardware and software [26, Section 5]. They also promote seamless integration of diverse structures and functions [26, Section 7].\n\u2022 Descriptive and explanatory range. It appears that the descriptive and explanatory range of the SP system is much wider than any of the alternatives mentioned above. In terms of demonstrable capabilities as well as abstract concepts, it has strengths in areas that include the representation of diverse forms of knowledge (including class hierarchies, part-whole hierarchies, and their seamless integration), unsupervised learning, natural language processing, fuzzy pattern recognition and recognition at multiple levels of abstraction, best-match and semantic forms of information retrieval, several kinds of reasoning (one-step \u2018deductive reasoning\u2019, abductive reasoning, probabilistic networks and trees, reasoning with \u2018rules\u2019, nonmonotonic reasoning, explaining away, causal reasoning, and reasoning that is not supported by evidence), planning, problem solving, information compression, and aspects of neuroscience and of human perception and cognition.\n\u2022 Many potential benefits and applications. In the spirit of the quote at the start of the Introduction (\u201cThere is nothing more practical than a good theory\u201d), the SP theory, with its broad base of support, has many potential benefits and applications, as outlined in Appendix C.\n\u2022 Strong theoretical underpinnings. Compared with, for example, artificial neural networks and deep learning, the SP system appears to have much stronger and more coherent theoretical underpinnings. The multiple alignment framework provides a simple but powerful realisation of the concept on which the SP theory is founded: information compression via the matching and unification of patterns.\n\u2022 The SP theory is a theory of computing. Most other research is founded on the idea that computing may be understood in terms of the Universal Turing Machine or equivalent models such as Lamda Calculus or Post\u2019s Canonical System. By contrast, the SP theory is itself a theory of computing [19, Chapter 4]. What is distinctive about the SP theory as a theory of computing is that it provides much of the human-like intelligence that is missing from earlier models.35\n35Although Alan Turing saw that computers might become intelligent [14], the Universal Turing Machine, in itself, does not tell us how! The SP theory goes some way towards plugging the gap, with potential to do more.\n\u2022 Information compression via the matching and unification of patterns. In trying to cut through complexities, the SP research programme focuses on a simple, \u2018primitive\u2019 idea: that information compression may be understood as a search for patterns that match each other, with the merging or \u2018unification\u2019 of patterns that are the same. The potential advantage of this approach, focussing on the simple concept of matching and unifying patterns, is that it can help us avoid old tramlines, and open doors to new ways of thinking.\n\u2022 Multiple alignment. More specifically, information compression via the matching and unification of patterns provides the basis for a concept of multiple alignment, borrowed and adapted from that concept in bioinformatics. Developing this idea as a framework for the simplification and integration of concepts across a broad canvass has been a major undertaking. Multiple alignment is a distinctive and powerful idea in the SP research programme.\n\u2022 Transparency in the representation and processing of knowledge. By contrast with sub-symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence (artificial neural networks, deep learning, and related approaches), and notwithstanding objections to symbolic AI,36 knowledge in the SP system is transparent and open to inspection, and likewise for the processing of knowledge.\n\u2022 The DONSVIC principle. A related point is that unsupervised learning in the SP system is geared to the realisation of the \u201cDONSVIC\u201d principle\u2014 The Discovery of Natural Structures Via Information Compression [21, Section 5.2]. By contrast with sub-symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence, structures created by learning should, normally, be comprehensible by people.\n\u2022 Perception and cognition. The SP theory draws extensively on research on human and animal perception and cognition, and neuroscience. In particular, an important part of its inspiration is research on the learning of natural language (see www.cognitionresearch.org/lang learn.html).\n\u2022 SP-neural. The SP theory includes proposals\u2014SP-neural\u2014for how abstract concepts in the theory may be realised in terms of neurons and neural processes. The SP-neural proposals (Appendix A.6) are significantly different from artificial neural networks as commonly conceived in computer science, and arguably more plausible in terms of neuroscience.\n36See, for example, \u201cHubert Dreyfus\u2019s views on artificial intelligence\u201d, Wikipedia, bit.ly/1hGHVm8, retrieved 2014-08-19."}, {"heading": "C Some potential benefits and applications of", "text": "the SP system\nWith the SP system, there is a large range of potential benefits and applications, some of which are outlined in the following subsections.\nSome potential applications may be developed on relatively short timescales using existing high-performance computers or even ordinary computers. These include the SP system as an intelligent database (Appendix C.6), and applications in such areas as medical diagnosis (Appendix C.13.3), pattern recognition (Appendix C.5), information compression (Appendix C.13.5), highly-economical transmission of information (Appendix C.13.1, [24, Section VIII]), bioinformatics (Appendix C.13.4), and natural language processing (Appendix C.4.3).\nMore radical solutions, that may take longer to develop, include a radically new architecture for computers (Appendix C.2), and developing the full potential of the system in computer vision (Appendix C.7), and natural language processing (Appendix C.4)."}, {"heading": "C.1 Simplification and integration of concepts", "text": "Although some people may argue otherwise, the world of computing suffers from a deep malaise: its fragmentation into a myriad of concepts, shown schematically in Figure 5, a myriad of different formalisms and formats for representing knowledge, each with its own mode of processing [24, Section III], and the extraordinary complexity of many computing systems, especially software.\nThe quest for simplification and integration in the SP theory accords with Occam\u2019s Razor, one of the most widely-accepted principles in science. In terms of that principle, seeking to combine conceptual simplicity with descriptive and explanatory power:\n\u2022 A relatively simple conceptual framework\u2014multiple alignment\u2014provides an account of a wide range of concepts and phenomena [19, 21].\n\u2022 There is potential for very substantial simplification of computing systems, taking hardware and software together [26, Section 5], and for seamless integration of diverse structures and functions [26, Sections 2 and 7].\n\u2022 Like any theory that simplifies and integrates a good range of observations and concepts, the SP theory promises deeper insights and better solutions to problems than may otherwise be achieved [26, Section 6], [23, Section IV-A3]."}, {"heading": "C.2 A radically new architecture for computers", "text": "The SP system has the potential to provide the basis for a radically new architecture for computers, either via the abstract model (with a central role for multiple alignment) or, more likely, via SP-neural. Potential benefits of this new architecture would be human-like versatility and adaptability in computing, substantial simplification of software, and dramatic reductions in the energy demands of computers, and in their size and weight [24, Section IX]."}, {"heading": "C.3 Unsupervised learning", "text": "The SP theory originates in part from an earlier programme of research on grammatical inference and the unsupervised learning of natural language, with minimum length encoding as a central principle [16], [23, Section V-A3]. However, meeting the goals of the SP research programme has meant a radical reorganisation of computer models, with the development of multiple alignment as a framework for the simplification and integration of diverse structures and functions [23, Section V-A4]. The new model demonstrates capabilities in grammatical inference ([19, Chapter 9], Appendix A.3.3) and appears to have considerable potential for further development with linguistic, visual, and other kinds of knowledge."}, {"heading": "C.4 Natural language processing", "text": "In addition to the learning of linguistic knowledge (Appendix C.3), the SP system has strengths in the parsing of natural language, the production of natural language, and the integration of syntactic and semantic knowledge, as outlined in this section. These aspects of the system are described more fully in [21, Section 8] and in [19, Chapter 5].\nC.4.1 Parsing of natural language\nFigure 6 shows how, via multiple alignment, a sentence (in row 0) may be parsed in terms of grammatical structures including words (rows 1 to 8).37 It also shows, in row 8, how the system may mark the syntactic dependency between the plural subject of the sentence (\u2018Np\u2019) and the plural main verb (\u2018Vp\u2019) (see also [19, Sections 5.4 and 5.5], [21, Section 8.1]).\nTo create a multiple alignment like the one in the figure, the system needs a grammar of Old patterns, like those shown, one per row, in rows 1 to 8 of the figure. In this example, the patterns represent linguistic structures including words.\nAlthough SP patterns are remarkably simple, it appears that, within the multiple alignment framework, they have at least the expressive power of a contextsensitive grammar [19, Sections 5.4 and 5.5]. As previously noted (Appendix A.2), there is reason to believe that, within the multiple alignment framework, all kinds of knowledge may be represented by SP patterns.\n37Compared with the multiple alignment shown in Figure 3, this multiple alignment is rotated through 90\u25e6, replacing columns with rows. The choice between these two styles, which are equivalent, depends largely on what fits best on the page.\nC.4.2 Production of natural language\nA neat feature of the SP system is that one set of mechanisms may achieve both the analysis or parsing of natural language (Appendix C.4.1) and the generation or production of sentences. This is explained in [19, Section 3.8] and [21, Section 4.5].\nC.4.3 The integration of syntax and semantics\nThe use of one simple format for all kinds of knowledge is likely to facilitate the seamless integration of syntax and semantics. Preliminary examples of how this may be done are shown in [19, Section 5.7], both for the derivation of meanings from surface forms [19, Figure 5.18] and for the production of surface forms from meanings [19, Figure 5.19].\nIt appears that, on relatively short timescales, there is potential via the SP system to create natural language interfaces for such things as internet TVs, DVD recorders and the like, and thus help to overcome much of the difficulty that many people now experience in controlling these things.\nC.4.4 Parallel streams of information\nUp to now, most work on natural language within the SP research programme has made the simplifying assumption that language may be represented with a sequence of symbols, as in ordinary text. But with some aspects of natural language such as formants in speech, and the relationship between syntax and semantics, there seem to be parallel streams of information. The way in which such parallelism may be represented and processed with 2D patterns in the SP system is described in [23, Section IV-B4 and Appendix C]."}, {"heading": "C.5 Pattern recognition", "text": "As described quite fully in [19, Chapter 6] and more briefly in [21, Section 9], the SP system has strengths in several aspects of pattern recognition:\n\u2022 It can recognise patterns at multiple levels of abstraction, with the integration of class-inclusion relations and part-whole relations, as shown in the example in Figure 3.\n\u2022 It can model \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d or polythetic categories, meaning that recognition does not depend on the presence absence of any particular feature or combination of features.\n\u2022 Recognition is robust in the face of errors of omission, commission or substitution in the New pattern or patterns.\n\u2022 For any given identification, or any related inference, the SP system may calculate associated probabilities.\n\u2022 As a by-product of how recognition is achieved via the building of multiple alignments, the system provides a model for the way in which context may influence recognition.\nC.6 Information storage and retrieval, with intelligence\nThe SP theory provides a versatile model for database systems, with the ability to accommodate object-oriented structures, as well as relational \u2018tuples\u2019, and network and tree models of data [20]. It lends itself most directly to information retrieval in the manner of query-by-example but it appears to have potential to support the use of natural language or query languages such as SQL.\nUnlike some ordinary database systems:\n\u2022 The storage and retrieval of information is integrated with other aspects of intelligence such as pattern recognition, reasoning, planning, problem solving, and learning\u2014as outlined elsewhere in this document.\n\u2022 The SP system provides a simple but effective means of combining class hierarchies with part-whole hierarchies, with inheritance of attributes (Appendix A.4).\n\u2022 It provides for cross-classification with multiple inheritance.\n\u2022 There is flexibility and versatility in the representation of knowledge arising from the fact that the system does not distinguish \u2018parts\u2019 and \u2018attributes\u2019 [20, Section 4.2.1].\n\u2022 Likewise, the absence of a distinction between \u2018class\u2019 and \u2018object\u2019 facilitates the representation of knowledge and eliminates the need for a \u2018metaclass\u2019 [20, Section 4.2.2].\n\u2022 SP patterns provide a simpler and more direct means of representing entityrelationship models than do relational tuples [20, Section 4.2.3].\nC.7 Vision\nWith generalisation of the SP system to accommodate 2D patterns, it has potential to model several aspects of natural vision and to facilitate the development of human-like abilities in artificial vision [22]. In these connections, the main strengths and potential of the SP system are:\n\u2022 Low level perceptual features such as edges or corners may be identified via the multiple alignment framework by the extraction of redundancy in uniform areas in the manner of the run-length encoding technique for information compression.\n\u2022 The system may be applied in the recognition of objects and in scene analysis, with the same strengths as in pattern recognition (Appendix C.5).\n\u2022 There is potential for the learning of visual entities and classes of entity and the piecing together of coherent concepts from fragments [22, Section 5].\n\u2022 There is potential, via multiple alignment, for the creation of 3D models of objects and of surroundings [22, Section 6].\n\u2022 The SP theory provides an account of how we may see things that are not objectively present in an image, how we may recognise something despite variations in the size of its retinal image, and how raster graphics and vector graphics may be unified.\n\u2022 And the SP theory has things to say about the phenomena of lightness constancy and colour constancy, ambiguities in visual perception, and the integration of vision with other senses and other aspects of intelligence."}, {"heading": "C.8 Reasoning", "text": "As described in quite fully in [19, Chapters 7 and 10, Section 6.4] and more selectively in [21, Section 10], the SP system lends itself to several kinds of reasoning:\n\u2022 One-step \u2018deductive\u2019 reasoning.\n\u2022 Abductive reasoning.\n\u2022 Reasoning with probabilistic decision networks and decision trees.\n\u2022 Reasoning with \u2018rules\u2019.\n\u2022 Nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning with default values.\n\u2022 Reasoning in Bayesian networks, including \u201cexplaining away\u201d.\n\u2022 Causal diagnosis.\n\u2022 Reasoning which is not supported by evidence.\n\u2022 Inheritance of attributes in an object-oriented class hierarchy or heterarchy.\nThere is also potential for spatial reasoning [23, Section IV-F1] and what-if reasoning [23, Section IV-F2].\nThese several kinds of reasoning may work together seamlessly without awkward incompatibilities, and likewise for how they may integrate seamlessly with such AI functions as unsupervised learning, pattern recognition, and so on [26, Sections 2, 4, and 7].\nFor any given inference reached via any of these kinds of reasoning, the SP system may calculate associated probabilities (Appendix A.5).\nAlthough the system is fundamentally probabilistic, it may imitate the effect of logic and other \u2018exact\u2019 forms of reasoning [19, Section 10.4.5]."}, {"heading": "C.9 Planning and problem solving", "text": "With data about flights between different cities, represented using SP patterns, the SP computer model may find a route between any two cities (if such a route exists) and, if there are alternative routes, it may find them as well [19, Section 8.2].\nProvided they are translated into textual form, the SP computer model can solve geometric analogy problems of the kind found in puzzle books and some IQ tests [19, Section 8.3], [21, Section 12]."}, {"heading": "C.10 Software engineering", "text": "Although it may not seem obvious at first sight, the multiple alignment framework can model several devices used in ordinary procedural programming, including: procedure, function, or subroutine; variable, value and type; function with parameters; conditional statement; and the means of repeating operations such as repeat ... until or do ... while [26, Section 6.6.1]. In accordance with good practice in software engineering, the SP system facilitates the integration of \u2018programs\u2019 with \u2018data\u2019. And as previously noted (Appendix A.4), the SP system supports objectoriented concepts such as class hierarchies with inheritance of attributes.\nIn [26, Section 6.6.3], it is suggested that, since SP patterns at the \u2018top\u2019 level are independent of each other, they may serve to model processes that may run in parallel. Now it appears that a better option is to model parallel processes as\nparallel streams of information, represented in 2D SP patterns as described in [23, Appendix C]. The advantage of this latter scheme is that it provides the means of showing when two or more events occur at the same time and, more generally, the relative timings of events.\nWithin the SP system, these structures and mechanisms may serve in the representation and processing of sequential and parallel procedures from the real world such as those required for cooking a meal, organising a party, going shopping, and so on.\nPotential benefits in software engineering include the elimination of compiling or interpretation, automatic programming, benefits in verification and validation, and helping to overcome the problem of technical debt [26, Section 6.6]."}, {"heading": "C.11 Mathematics", "text": "Aspects of mathematics may be understood in terms of some basic techniques for information compression: chunking-with-codes, schema-plus-correction, and runlength coding [25], and some features of mathematics may be modelled in the SP system [19, Chapter 10].\nOn the strength of this evidence and some other considerations, there is reason to believe that all of mathematics may be understood in terms of information compression. There appear to be considerable implications for mathematics, and also for science\u2014because of the importance of mathematics as a language of science.\nC.12 Human perception and cognition, and neuroscience\nPart of the inspiration for the SP theory has been earlier research on the role of information compression in the workings of brains and nervous systems [1, 2, 3], and a programme of research on the learning of a first language or languages [16]. Thus there is reason to believe that the SP theory may help to illuminate human perception and cognition.\nSince the converse is true\u2014that insights into the nature of human perception and cognition may help to inform the development of the SP theory\u2014the two things are often considered together, as can be seen in [19, 22] and other writings about the SP system.\nAs outlined in Appendix A.6, the SP theory includes the proposal\u2014called SPneural\u2014that abstract concepts in the theory may be realised in terms of neurons and their interconnections [19, Chapter 11].\nC.13 Other potential benefits and applications\nThe versatility of the SP system may be seen not only in the areas outlined above but in potential benefits and applications summarised in the following subsections."}, {"heading": "C.13.1 Big data", "text": "The SP system may help to solve nine problems associated with big data [24].
