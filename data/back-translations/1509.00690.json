Web server access logs contain substantial data about the accesses of users to a Web site. Hence, if properly exploited, the log data can reveal useful information about the navigational behaviour of users in a site. In order to reveal the information about user preferences from, Web Usage Mining is being performed. Web Usage Mining is the application of data mining techniques to web usage log repositories in order to discover the usage patterns that can be used to analyze the user\u2019s navigational behavior. WUM contains three main steps: preprocessing, knowledge extraction and results analysis. During the preprocessing stage, raw web log data is transformed into a set of user profiles. Each user profile captures a set of URLs representing a user session. Clustering can be applied to this sessionized data in order to capture similar interests and trends among users\u2019 navigational patterns. Since the sessionized data may contain thousands of user sessions and each user session may consist of hundreds of URL accesses, dimensionality reduction is achieved by eliminating the low support URLs. Very small sessions are also removed in order to filter out the noise from the data. But direct elimination of low support URLs and small sized sessions may results in loss of a significant amount of information especially when the count of low support URLs and small sessions is large. We propose a fuzzy solution to deal with this problem by assigning weights to URLs and user sessions based on a fuzzy membership function. After assigning the weights we apply a \u201dFuzzy c-Mean Clustering\u201d algorithm to discover the clusters of user profiles. In this paper, we describe our fuzzy set theoretic approach to perform feature selection (or dimensionality reduction) and session weight assignment. Finally we compare our soft computing based approach of dimensionality reduction with the traditional approach of direct elimination of small sessions and low support count URLs. Our results show that fuzzy feature evaluation and dimensionality reduction results in better performance and validity indices for the discovered clusters.\nKeywords\u2014 web usage mining; fuzzy c-means clustering, feature evaluation; dimensionality reduction;\nI. INTRODUCTION The World Wide Web as a large and dynamic information source is a fertile ground for data mining principles or Web Mining. Web mining is primarily aimed at deriving actionable knowledge from the Web through the application of various data mining techniques [1]. Web Usage Mining is the discovery of user access patterns from Web server access logs [2]. Web Usage Mining analyses results of user interactions with a Web server, including Web logs and database transactions at a Web site. Web usage mining includes clustering to find natural groupings of users or\npages, associations to discover the URLs requested together and analysis of the sequential order in which URLs are accessed [3]. Web Usage Mining (WUM) consists of three main steps: preprocessing, knowledge extraction and results analysis [4]. The goal of the preprocessing step is to transform the raw web log data into a set of user profiles. Each such profile captures a sequence or a set of URLs representing a user session [5]. Web usage data preprocessing exploit a variety of algorithms and heuristic techniques for various preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning, user identification, session identification etc [6].

Fuzzy c-Means Clustering: Fuzzy c-means clustering was proposed by Dunn [20] and improved by Bezdek [21] and is frequently used in the field of data mining. In this technique each data point belongs to a cluster to a degree specified by a membership grade. As in hard c-means clustering, Fuzzy C-means clustering relies on minimizing a cost function of dissimilarity measure. Fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) incorporates the basic idea of Hard C-means clustering (HCM), with the difference that in FCM each data point belongs to a cluster to a degree of membership grade, while in HCM every data point either belongs to a certain cluster or does not belong. Therefore FCM performs the fuzzy clustering in such a way that a given data point may belong to several clusters with the degree of belongingness specified by membership grades between 0 and 1. However, FCM still uses an objective function that is to be minimized while trying to partition the data set. The algorithm calculates the cluster centers and assigns a membership value to each data item corresponding to every cluster within a range of 0 to 1. The algorithm utilizes a fuzziness index parameter q where ],1[ q [22] which determines the degree of fuzziness in the clusters. As the value of q reaches to 1, the algorithm works like a crisp partitioning algorithm. Increase in the value of q results in more overlapping of the clusters.\nLet  | 1iX x i m   be a set of n-dimensional data point vectors where m is the number of data points and each\n1 2{ , , , } 1 i i i i nx x x x i m    .

Instead of directly removing all the low session support URLs below a specified threshold, we assign weights to the URLs using a fuzzy membership function based on the session support count of the URL. Similarly, instead of directly removing all the small sessions below a specified threshold, we assign weights to the sessions using another fuzzy Membership function based on the number of URLs accessed by the sessions. Finally we compared our soft computing based approach of URL and session weight assignment with the traditional hard computing based approach of low support URL and small session elimination. Our results show that the fuzzy set theoretic approach of URL and session weight assignment results in better minimization of clustering performance index than without session weight assignment. It also improves the validity index much better than without weight assignment.\nREFERENCES [1] P. Kolari and A.

Web server access logs contain substantial data about the accesses of users to a Web site. Hence, if properly exploited, the log data can reveal useful information about the navigational behaviour of users in a site. In order to reveal the information about user preferences from, Web Usage Mining is being performed. Web Usage Mining is the application of data mining techniques to web usage log repositories in order to discover the usage patterns that can be used to analyze the user\u2019s navigational behavior. WUM contains three main steps: preprocessing, knowledge extraction and results analysis. During the preprocessing stage, raw web log data is transformed into a set of user profiles. Each user profile captures a set of URLs representing a user session. Clustering can be applied to this sessionized data in order to capture similar interests and trends among users\u2019 navigational patterns. Since the sessionized data may contain thousands of user sessions and each user session may consist of hundreds of URL accesses, dimensionality reduction is achieved by eliminating the low support URLs. Very small sessions are also removed in order to filter out the noise from the data. But direct elimination of low support URLs and small sized sessions may results in loss of a significant amount of information especially when the count of low support URLs and small sessions is large. We propose a fuzzy solution to deal with this problem by assigning weights to URLs and user sessions based on a fuzzy membership function. After assigning the weights we apply a \u201dFuzzy c-Mean Clustering\u201d algorithm to discover the clusters of user profiles. In this paper, we describe our fuzzy set theoretic approach to perform feature selection (or dimensionality reduction) and session weight assignment. Finally we compare our soft computing based approach of dimensionality reduction with the traditional approach of direct elimination of small sessions and low support count URLs. Our results show that fuzzy feature evaluation and dimensionality reduction results in better performance and validity indices for the discovered clusters.
