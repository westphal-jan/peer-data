Many of the structures that humans impose on the world, such as logical reasoning, analogies, or taxonomies, are based on entities, concepts and their relationships. Hence, learning from and with relational knowledge representations has long been considered an important task in artificial intelligence (see e.g., Getoor et al. (2007); Muggleton (1991); Gentner (1983); Kemp et al. (2006); Xu et al. (2006); Richardson et al. (2006)). In this work we are concerned with learning from knowledge graphs (KGs), i.e., knowledge bases which model facts as instances of binary relations (e.g., bornIn(BarackObama, Hawaii)). This form of knowledge representation can be interpreted as a multigraph, where entities correspond to nodes, facts correspond to typed edges, and the type of an edge indicates the relation type. Modern knowledge graphs such as YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007), and Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) contain billions of facts about millions of entities and have have found important applications in question answering, structured search, and digital assistants. Recently, vector space embeddings of knowledge graphs have received considerable attention, as they can be used to to create statistical models of entire KGs, i.e., to predict the probability (or score) of any possible relation instance (edge) in the graph.\nCopyright c\u00a9 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nSuch models can be used to derive new knowledge from known facts (link prediction), to disambiguate entities (entity resolution), to extract taxonomies, and to answer questions probabilistically (see e.g., Nickel et al. (2011); Bordes et al. (2013); Krompa\u00df et al. (2014)). Moreover, embeddings of KGs have been used to support machine reading and to assess the trustworthiness of web sites (Dong et al., 2014, 2015).\nHowever, existing embedding models that can capture rich interactions in relational data are often limited in their scalability. Vice versa, models that can be computed efficiently are often considerably less expressive. Here, we approach learning from KGs within the framework of compositional vector space models. We introduce holographic embeddings (HOLE) which use the circular correlation of entity embeddings (vector representations) to create compositional representations of binary relational data. By using correlation as the compositional operator HOLE can capture rich interactions but simultaneously remains efficient to compute, easy to train, and scalable to very large datasets. As we will show experimentally, the proposed approach is able to outperform state-of-the-art embedding models consistently on a variety of benchmark datasets for learning form KGs and relational data. Compositional vector space models have also been considered in cognitive science and natural language processing, e.g., to model symbolic structures, to represent the semantic meaning of phrases, and as models for associative memory (see e.g., Smolensky (1990); Plate (1995); Mitchell et al. (2008); Socher et al. (2012)). In this work, we do not only draw inspiration from these models, but we will also highlight the connections of HOLE to holographic models of associative memory.\nCompositional Representations In this section we introduce compositional vector space models for KGs, the general learning setting, and related work.\nLet E denote the set of all entities and P the set of all relation types (predicates) in a domain. A binary relation is a subsetRp \u2286 E \u00d7E of all pairs of entities (i.e., those pairs which are in a relation of type p). Higher-arity relations are defined analogously. The characteristic function \u03c6p : E \u00d7 E \u2192 {\u00b11} of a relation Rp indicates for each possible pair of entities whether they are part of Rp. We will denote (possible) relation instances as Rp(s, o), where s, o \u2208 E denote the first and second argument of the asymmetric relationRp. We will\nar X\niv :1\n51 0.\n04 93\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 6\nO ct\n2 01\n5\nrefer to s, o as subject and object and toRp(s, o) as triples. Compositional vector space models provide an elegant way to learn the characteristic functions of the relations in a knowledge graph, as they allow to cast the learning task as a problem of supervised representation learning. Here, we discuss models of the form\nPr(\u03c6p(s, o) = 1|\u0398) = \u03c3(\u03b7spo) = \u03c3(r>p (es \u25e6 eo)) (1)\nwhere rp \u2208 Rdr , ei \u2208 Rde are vector representations of relations and entities; \u03c3(x) = 1/(1 + exp(\u2212x)) denotes the logistic function; \u0398 = {ei}nei=1 \u222a {rk} nr k=1 denotes the set of all embeddings; \u25e6 : Rde \u00d7 Rde \u2192 Rdp denotes the compositional operator which creates a composite vector representation for the pair (s, o) from the embeddings es, eo. We will discuss possible compositional operators below.\nLet xi \u2208 P \u00d7 E \u00d7 E denote a triple, and yi \u2208 {\u00b11} denote its label. Given a dataset D = {(xi, yi)}mi=1 of true and false relation instances, we then want to learn representations of entities and relations \u0398 that best explain D according to eq. (1). This can, for instance, be done by minimizing the (regularized) logistic loss\nmin \u0398 m\u2211 i=1 log(1 + exp(\u2212yi\u03b7i)) + \u03bb\u2016\u0398\u201622. (2)\nFor relational data, minimizing the logistic loss has the additional advantage that it can help to find low dimensional embeddings for complex relational patterns (Bouchard et al., 2015). However, in most cases, KGs store only true triples and non-existing triples can be either missing of false (openworld assumption). In this case, negative examples can be generated by heuristics such as the local closed world assumption (Dong et al., 2014). Alternatively, we can use a pairwise ranking loss such as\nmin \u0398 \u2211 i\u2208D+ \u2211 j\u2208D\u2212 max(0, \u03b3 + \u03c3(\u03b7j)\u2212 \u03c3(\u03b7i)) (3)\nto rank the probability of existing triples higher than the probability of non-existing ones. Here, D+,D\u2212 denote the set of existing and non-existing instances and \u03b3 > 0 specifies the width of the margin (Bordes et al., 2011).\nAn important property of compositional models is that the meaning and representation of entities does not vary with regard to their position in the compositional representation (i.e., the i-th entity has the same representation ei as subject and object). Since the representations of all entities and relations are learned jointly in eqs. (2) and (3), this property allows to propagate information between facts, to capture global dependencies in the data, and to enable the desired relational learning effect. For a review of machine learning on knowledge graphs see also Nickel et al. (2015).\nExisting models for knowledge graphs are based on the following compositional operators:\nTensor Product Given entity embeddings a, b \u2208 Rd, tensor product models represent pairs of entities via a \u25e6 b = a\u2297 b \u2208 Rd2 , i.e, via all pairwise multiplicative interactions between the features of a and b:\n[a\u2297 b]ij = aibj . (4)\nIntuitively, a feature in the tuple representation a\u2297 b is \u201con\u201d (i.e., has a high absolute magnitude), if and only if the corresponding features of both entities are \u201con\u201d (See also fig. 1a). This allows eq. (1) to capture relational patterns such as liberal persons are typically members of liberal parties since a single feature in a\u2297 b can encode that the subject is a liberal person and that the object is a liberal party. Compositional models using the tensor product such as RESCAL (Nickel et al., 2011) (also called bilinear model) and the Neural Tensor Network (Socher et al., 2013). have shown state-of-the-art performance for learning from KGs. Smolensky (1990) introduced the tensor product as a way to create compositional vector representations. While the tensor product allows to capture rich interactions, its main problem as a compositional operator lies in the fact that it requires a large number of parameters. Since a \u2297 b explicitly models all pairwise interactions, rp in eq. (1) must be of size d2. This can be problematic both in terms of overfitting and computational demands. Since eq. (1) in combination with the tensor product is equivalent to \u03b7spo = e>s Rpeo, Yang et al. (2015) proposed to use diagonal Rp\u2019s to reduce the number of parameters. However, since e>s Rpeo = e>o Rpes for diagonal Rp, this approach can only model symmetric relations and is not suitable to model general knowledge graphs.\nConcatenation, Projection, and Non-Linearity Another way to compute composite representations is via concatenation, projection and subsequent application of a non-linear function. Let \u2295 : Rd1 \u00d7 Rd2 \u2192 Rd1+d2 denote concatenation and \u03c8 : R \u2192 R be a non-linear function such as tanh. The composite tuple representation is then given by a \u25e6 b = \u03c8(W (a\u2295 b)) \u2208 Rh, such that\n[\u03c8(W (a\u2295 b))]i = \u03c8 (\u2211\nj waijaj + \u2211 j wbijbj ) (5)\nwhere the projection matrix W \u2208 Rh\u00d72d is learned in combination with the entity and relation embeddings. Intuitively, a feature in the tuple representation W (a \u2295 b) is \u201con\u201d if at least one of the corresponding features is \u201con\u201d. The main advantage of this compositional operator is that the mapping from entity embeddings to representations of pairs is learned adaptively via the matrix W . Although W is of size h\u00d7 2d, this can lead to a reduced number of parameters compared to the tensor product. However, the resulting composite representations are also less rich, as they do not consider direct interactions of features. As Socher et al. (2013) noted, the non-linearity \u03c8 provides only weak interactions while leading to a harder optimization problem. A variant of this compositional operator which also includes a relation embedding in the composite representation has be used in the ER-MLP model of the Knowledge Vault (Dong et al., 2014).\nNon-compositional Methods Another class of models does not (explicitly) form compositional representations, but predicts the existence of triples from the similarity of the vector space embeddings. In particular, TRANSE (Bordes et al., 2013) models the score of a fact as the distance between relation-specific translations of entity embeddings:\nscore(Rp(s, o)) = \u2212dist(es + rp, eo) . (6)\nA major appeal of TRANSE is that it requires very few parameters and moreover is easy to train. However, this simplicity comes also at the cost of modeling power. Wang et al. (2014) and Lin et al. (2015) proposed TRANSH and TRANSR respectively, to improve the performance of TRANSE on 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N relations. Unfortunately, these models lose the simplicity and efficiency of TRANSE."}, {"heading": "Holographic Embeddings", "text": "In this section, we propose a novel compositional model for KGs. To combine the expressive power of the tensor product with the efficiency and simplicity of TRANSE, we use the circular correlation of vectors as the compositional operator, i.e., we will represent pairs of entities via\na \u25e6 b = a ? b, (7)\nwhere ? : Rd \u00d7 Rd \u2192 Rd denotes circular correlation:1\n[a ? b]k = d\u22121\u2211 i=0 aib(k+i) mod d (8)\nHence, we model the probability of a triple as\nPr(\u03c6p(s, o) = 1|\u0398) = \u03c3(r>p (es ? eo)). (9)\nDue to its connections to holographic models of associative memory (which we will discuss in the next section) we refer to eq. (9) as holographic embeddings (HOLE) of KGs.\nAs a compositional operator, circular correlation can be interpreted as a compression of the tensor product. While the tensor product assigns a separate component cij = aibj for each pairwise interaction of entity features, in correlation\n1For notational convenience, we use zero-indexed vectors.\neach component corresponds to a sum over a fixed partition of pairwise interactions (see also fig. 2a). Intuitively, a feature in the tuple representation is \u201con\u201d if at least one partition of subject-object-interactions is on. This form of compression can be very effective for multi-relational data, as not all interactions between latent features are meaningful for all relations. For instance, the interaction of features such as liberal person and liberal party are irrelevant for the relation bornIn, but very important for the relation partyOf. Since the entity representations are learned and their features can be \u201cassigned\u201d to the best partition during learning, we can fix the partitioning of the interactions in advance.\nCompared to the tensor product, circular correlation has the important advantage that it does not increase the dimensionality of the composite representation (see also fig. 1b). The memory complexity of the tuple representation is therefore linear in the dimensionality d of the entity representations. Moreover, the runtime complexity is quasilinear (loglinear) in d, as circular correlation can be computed via\na ? b = F\u22121 ( F(a) F(b) ) where F(\u00b7) and F\u22121(\u00b7) denote the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and its inverse, x denotes the complex conjugate of x \u2208 Cd, and denotes the Hadamard (entrywise) product. The computational complexity of the FFT is O(d log d). Table 1 summarizes the improvements of circular correlation over the tensor product. Table 2 lists the memory complexity of HOLE in comparison to other embedding models.\nCircular convolution \u2217 : Rd \u00d7 Rd \u2192 Rd is an operation that is closely related to circular correlation and defined as\n[a \u2217 b]k = d\u22121\u2211 i=0 aib(k\u2212i) mod d. (10)\nIn comparison to convolution, correlation has two main advantages when used as a compositional operator: Non Commutative Correlation, unlike convolution, is not\ncommutative, i.e., a ? b 6= b ? a. Non-commutativity is necessary to model asymmetric relations (directed graphs) with compositional representations.\nSimiliarity Component In the correlation a ? b, a single component [a ? b]0 = \u2211 i aibi corresponds to the dot\nTo compute the representations for entities and relations, we minimize either eq. (2) or (3) via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Let \u03b8 \u2208 {ei}ni=1 \u222a {rk}mk=1 denote the embedding of a single entity or relation and let fspo = \u03c3(r>p (es ? eo)). The gradients of eq. (9) are then given by\n\u2202fspo \u2202\u03b8 = \u2202fspo \u2202\u03b7spo \u2202\u03b7spo \u2202\u03b8 ,\nwhere \u2202\u03b7spo \u2202rp = es ? eo, \u2202\u03b7spo \u2202es = rp ? eo, \u2202\u03b7spo \u2202eo = rp \u2217 es. (11) The partial gradients in eq. (11) follow directly from\nr>p (es ? eo) = e > s (rp ? eo) = e > o (rp \u2217 es) (12)\nand standard vector calculus. Equation (12) can be derived as follows: First we rewrite correlation in terms of convolution:\na ? b = a\u0303 \u2217 b where a\u0303 denotes the involution of a, meaning that a\u0303 is the mirror image of a such that a\u0303i = a\u2212imod d (Scho\u0308nemann, 1987, eq. 2.4). Equation (12) follows then from the following identities in convolution algebra (Plate, 1995):\nc>(a\u0303 \u2217 b) = a>(c\u0303 \u2217 b); c>(a\u0303 \u2217 b) = b>(a \u2217 c). Similar to correlation, the circular convolution in eq. (11) can be computed efficiently in Fourier space via a \u2217 b = F\u22121(F(a) F(b)).\nAssociative Memory In this section we outline the connections of eq. (9) and eq. (11) to holographic models of associative memory. Such models employ a sequence of convolutions and correlations as used in holography to store and retrieve information (e.g., see Gabor (1969); Poggio (1973)). In particular, holographic reduced representations (Plate, 1995) store the association of a with b via the circular convolution\nm = a \u2217 b,\nand retrieve the item associated with a from m via\nb\u2032 \u2248 a ?m = b \u2217 (a ? a)\nIf a ? a \u2248 \u03b4 (i.e., the identity element of convolution), it holds that b \u2248 b\u2032, and b can be retrieved exactly, otherwise we retrieve a noisy version. For denoising, we can pass the retrieved vector through a clean-up memory, which returns the item stored in the clean-up memory that has the highest similarity to the item retrieved from m. For instance, if \u2016a\u2016 = \u2016bi\u2016 = 1, we can perform the clean-up via\nb = arg max bi\nb>i (a ?m) (13)\nMultiple elements are stored in m via superposition: m = \u2211\ni ai \u2217 bi.\nHence, m acts in this scheme as a memory that stores associations between vectors which are stored and retrieved using circular convolution and correlation.\nConsider now the following model of associative memory for relational data: Let So = {(s, p) |\u03c6p(s, o) = 1} be the set of all subject-predicate indices for which the relation Rp(s, o) is true. Next, we store these existing relations via convolution and superposition in the representation eo:\neo = \u2211\n(s,p)\u2208So\nrp \u2217 es (14)\nIn this scheme, the compositional representation es ? eo of eq. (7) would be analogous to the retrieval of the stored relations between s and o. Similarly, computing \u03c3(r>p (es?eo)) as in eq. (9) is analogous to computing the probability that rp is included in the retrieved relations, i.e., that we have seen\nthe tripleRp(s, o). The norm constraints of eq. (13) can either be enforced directly (by projection the embeddings onto the unit circle) or through the regularization of the embeddings (which is equivalent to \u2016ei\u2016 \u2264 Ce, \u2016rk\u2016 \u2264 Cr, where Ce, Cr depend on the regularization parameter).\nAn important difference of HOLE to associative memory is that it does not only memorize, but it generalizes in a well defined way: In associative memory we are given the embeddings and store the associations directly, typically via Hebbian learning (e.g., see eq. (14)). In HOLE, we do not simply store the associations, but instead learn the embeddings that best explain the observed data. By iterating over D with SGD, we update the embeddings of the objects via\net+1o \u2190 eto \u2212 \u03b3 \u2202L \u2202f \u2202f \u2202\u03b7 (rtp \u2217 ets). (15)\nPlease note that the gradient for eo in eq. (15) corresponds exactly to the association of predicate and subject in holographic associative memory. Hence, we can interpret eq. (15) as adapting the \u201cmemory\u201d eo, such that the retrieval of the observed facts is improved. The same analogy holds for the updates of es and rp, however with the roles of correlation and convolution in storage and retrieval reversed. Moreover, in minimizing eq. (2) via eq. (15), we are estimating a probability distribution over all possible states of the knowledge graph which allows us to predict the probability of any possible triple in the graph (see e.g., Nickel et al. (2015))."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Knowledge Graphs", "text": "To evaluate its performance for link prediction on knowledge graphs, we compared HOLE to state-of-the-art models on two commonly used benchmark datasets for this task: WN18 WordNet is a knowledge graph that groups words\ninto synonyms and provides lexical relationships between words. The WN18 dataset consists of a subset of Wordnet, containing 40,943 entities, 18 relation types, and 151,442 triples.\nFB15k Freebase is a large knowledge graph that provides general facts about the world (e.g., harvested from Wikipedia, MusicBrainz, etc.). The FB15k dataset consists of a subset of Freebase, containing 14,951 entities, 1345 relation types, and 592,213 triples.\nFor both datasets we used the fixed training-, validation-, and test-splits provided by Bordes et al. (2013). As baseline methods, we used RESCAL (Nickel et al., 2011), TRANSE (Bordes et al., 2013), TRANSR (Lin et al., 2015), and ERMLP (Dong et al., 2014). To facilitate a fair comparison we reimplemented all models and used the identical optimization method and loss function for training, i.e., SGD with AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) and the ranking loss of eq. (3). This improved the results of TRANSE and RESCAL significantly on both datasets compared to results previously reported by Bordes et al. (2013).2\n2TRANSE in its original implementation used SGD without AdaGrad. RESCAL used the least-squares loss and alternating leastsquares updates.\nFollowing Bordes et al. (2013), we generated negative relation instances for training by corrupting positive triples and used the following evaluation protocol: For each true triple Rp(s, o) in the test set, we replace the subject s with each entity s\u2032 \u2208 E , compute the score for Rp(s\u2032, o), and rank all these instances by their scores in decreasing order. Since there can exist multiple true triples in the test set for a given predicate-object pair, we remove all instances from the ranking where Rp(s\u2032, o) = 1 and s 6= s\u2032, i.e., we consider only the ranking of the test instance among all wrong instances (which corresponds to the \u201cFiltered\u201d setting in Bordes et al. (2013)). We then repeat this procedure by replacing the object o. To measure the quality of the ranking, we use the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) which is well established in information retrieval and in contrast to mean rank less sensitive to outliers. In addition to MRR, we report the ratio in which Rp(s, o) occurs within the first n results (denoted by \u201cHits at n\u201d). We optimized the hyperparameters of all models via extensive grid search and selected the model with the best filtered MRR score on the validation set. The results of these experiments are shown in table 3a. It can be seen that HOLE is able to outperform the considered baseline methods significantly and consistently on both datasets. For instance, TRANSE and TRANSR rank the test instance only in 11.5% and 33.5% of the cases as the most likely triple in WN18 (Hits at 1). In contrast, HOLE ranks the test instance in 93.0% of the cases as the most likely instance. While less pronounced, similar results can be observed on FB15k. In table 1, we report the dimensionality d and the resulting number of parameters of the selected models. It can be seen that HOLE is far more efficient in the number of parameters compared to the tensor product model RESCAL. Although the dimensionality d of the HOLE embedding is larger than RESCAL\u2019s (what is to be expected due to the compressive effect of correlation), the overall number of parameters is significantly reduced as its memory complexity depends only linearly on d."}, {"heading": "Relational Learning", "text": "We have shown that HOLE can predict triples successfully in knowledge graphs. In additional experiments, we wanted to test the relational learning capabilities of the compositional representation. For this purpose, we used the countries dataset of Bouchard et al. (2015), which consists of 244 countries, 22 subregions (e.g., Southern Africa, Western Europe) and 5 regions (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Oceania). Each country is located in exactly one region and subregion, each subregion is located in exactly one region, and each country can have a number of other countries as neighbors. From the raw data we created a relational representation with two predicates: locatedIn(e1, e2) and neighborOf(e1, e2). The task in the experiment was to predict locatedIn(c, r) instances, where c ranges over all countries and r over all regions in the data. The evaluation protocol was the following: First, we split all countries randomly in train, validation, and test set, such that for each country in the test set there is at least one neighbor in the training set. Next, we removed triples from the test and validation set in three different settings: S1) In the basic setting we only set locatedIn(c, r) to missing\nfor the countries in the test data.

S2) In addition to the instances of S1, we set locatedIn(c, s)\nto missing for all countries c in the test/validation set and all subregions s in the data. In this setting, the correct triples can be predicted from: neighborOf(c1, c2) \u2227 locatedIn(c2, r)\u21d2 locatedIn(c1, r) This is a harder task than S1, since a country can have multiple neighbors and these can be in different regions.\nS3) In addition to the instances of S1 and S2 we set all locatedIn(n, r) to missing for all neighbors n of all countries in the test/validation set and all regions r in the data. In this setting, the correct triples can be predicted from patterns of the form:\nneighborOf(c1, c2) \u2227 locatedIn(c2, s)\u2227 locatedIn(s, r)\u21d2 locatedIn(c1, r)\nThis is the most difficult task, as it not only involves the neighborOf relation, but also a path of length 3.\nSee fig. 3 for an illustration of the data structure and the test settings. We measured the prediction quality via the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR). The results of the experiments are shown in table 3b. It can be seen that HOLE is very successful in these learning tasks. For S1, the missing triples are predicted nearly perfectly. Moreover, even for the most difficult task S3, HOLE achieves very good results, especially since not every country\u2019s region can be predicted from its neighbors (e.g., islands have no neighbors). The poorer results of RESCAL and ER-MLP can likely be explained with overfitting (although the models are regularized), since the difference to HOLE is significantly reduced when the hyperparameters are optimized on the test set instead of the validation set. We observed similar results as in this experiment on commonly used benchmark datasets for statistical relational learning. Due to space constraints, we report these experiments in the supplementary material."}, {"heading": "Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this work we proposed HOLE, a compositional vector space model for knowledge graphs that is based on the circular correlation of vectors. An attractive property of circular\ncorrelation in this context is that it creates fixed-width representations, meaning that the compositional representation has the same dimensionality as the representation of its constituents. In HOLE, we exploited this property to create a compositional model that can capture rich interactions in relational data but simultaneously remains efficient to compute, easy to train, and very scalable. Experimentally we showed that HOLE provides state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark datasets and that it can model complex relational patterns while being very economical in the number of its parameters. Moreover, we highlighted connections of HOLE to holographic models of associative memory and discussed how it can be interpreted in this context. This creates not only a link between relational learning and associative memory, but allows also for principled ways to query the model, for instance in question answering.\nIn future work we plan to further exploit the fixed-width representations of holographic embeddings in complex scenarios, as they are especially suitable to model higher-arity relations (e.g., taughtAt(John, AI, MIT)) and facts about facts (e.g., believes(John, loves(Tom, Mary)))."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments & Reproducibility", "text": "This material is based upon work supported by the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM), funded by NSF STC award CCF-1231216.

(2013)).", "startOffset": 10, "endOffset": 676}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "For this purpose, we used the countries dataset of Bouchard et al.

In this work, we propose holographic embeddings (HOLE) to learn compositional vector space representations of entire knowledge graphs. The proposed method is related to holographic models of associative memory in that it employs circular correlation to create compositional representations. By using correlation as the compositional operator HOLE can capture rich interactions but simultaneously remains efficient to compute, easy to train, and scalable to very large datasets. In extensive experiments we show that holographic embeddings are able to outperform state-ofthe-art methods for link prediction in knowledge graphs and relational learning benchmark datasets.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
