Recently, there has been a growing interest in predicting demographic information from metadata. Previous approaches relied on standard machine learning algorithms and hand-generated functions. We are applying deep learning methods to mobile phone metadata for the first time using a revolutionary network. We present the data as 8 matrices summarizing incoming and outgoing mobile phone use (contacts, calls, SMS, call duration) within a given week. Our method surpasses previous technology in terms of both age and gender. Our analyses suggest that our method captures compositional hierarchies in mobile metadata based on the temporal nature of the data.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 16:07:21 GMT  (99kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06660v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 17:13:22 GMT  (99kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06660v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 21:00:39 GMT  (94kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06660v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 13 Feb 2016 14:08:15 GMT  (29kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06660v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["bjarke felbo", "p{\\aa}l sunds{\\o}y", "alex 'sandy' pentland", "sune lehmann", "yves-alexandre de montjoye"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06660"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.06660.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Bjarke Felbo", "P\u00e5l Sunds\u00f8y", "Sune Lehmann"], "emails": ["bfelbo@dtu.dk", "pal-roe.sundsoy@telenor.com", "sandy@media.mit.edu", "sljo@dtu.dk", "yvesalexandre@demontjoye.com", "yvesalexandre@demontjoye.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "Our mobile phones produce metadata every time we send or received a text or a phone call. These metadata \u2013 recording who calls or texts who, for how long, and from where \u2013 provide a detailed view of human behavior including mobility at large-scale. This data has great potential for good but often lacks basic demographic information, which is why there has recently been a growing interest in predicting demographic information, such as age and gender, from mobile phone metadata. Previous approaches relied on standard machine learning algorithms and hand-engineered features (Sarraute et al., 2014; Frias-Martinez et al., 2010).\nConvolutional networks (ConvNets) have recently systematically outperformed existing approaches in analyses of large-scale image datasets (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014). We show in this work how a ConvNet can be used to predict demographic information such as age and gender from standard mobile phone metadata."}, {"heading": "2 TEMPORAL REPRESENTATION", "text": "We focus on using the temporal information contained in mobile phone metadata. We represent the data as 8 matrices summarizing mobile phone usage on a given week with hours of the day on the x-axis and the weekdays on the y-axis (see Figure 1). These 8 matrices are combined into a tensor (less formally, a 3-dimensional matrix) with a separate \u2019channel\u2019 for each of the 8 variables of interest. These 8 channels are the number of unique contacts, calls, texts and the total duration of calls for respectively incoming and outgoing interactions. We model each week separately.\n*Corresponding author: yvesalexandre@demontjoye.com\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 66\n0v 4\n[ cs\n.L G\nhttp://localhost:8888/\n1 of 1 26-May-15 22:01"}, {"heading": "3 CONVNET ARCHITECTURE", "text": "Choosing the right architecture of the ConvNet for the task at hand is crucial to reaching high accuracy for the prediction task. We use a series of 5 horizontal conv. layers followed by a vertical conv. filter and 2 dense layers (see Table 1) to capture increasingly abstract patterns.\nThe ConvNet performs a prediction of the demographic attribute on each week of data using the softmax layer. These predictions are traditionally averaged to generate a single prediction for the user. We find that using the ConvNet as a feature extractor with a support vector machine (SVM) for prediction increases accuracy by 1 to 3 percentage points (see Table 2)."}, {"heading": "4 RESULTS", "text": "We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on gender and age prediction.
