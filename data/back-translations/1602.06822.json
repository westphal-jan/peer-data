However, the problem of learning abstract representations of images without manual supervision is an open problem in machine perception. Existing unsupervised learning techniques have tried to address this problem (Hinton and Salakhutdinov 2006; Ranzato et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2009) but lack the ability to produce latent factors of variations or symbolic visual concepts from raw data. Computer vision has historically been formulated as the problem of producing symbolic descriptions of scenes from input images (Horn 1986). Without disentangled and symbolic visual concepts, it is difficult to interpret or re-use representations across tasks as no single component of the representation vector has a semantic meaning by itself. Traditionally, it has been difficult to adapt neural network architectures to learn such representations from raw data. In this paper, we introduce a neural network architecture and a learning algorithm to produce factorized symbolic representations given consecutive images. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on datasets including faces undergoing 3D transformations, moving objects in 2D worlds, and Atari 2600 games."}, {"heading": "RELATED WORK", "text": "A number of generative models have been proposed in the literature to learn abstract visual representations including RBM-based models (Hinton and Salakhutdinov 2006, Lee et al. (2009)), variational auto-encoders (Kingma and Welling 2013; Rezende, Mohamed, and Wierstra 2014; Kulkarni et al. 2015), convolution based encoder-decoders (Ranzato et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2009), and generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al. 2014; Radford, Metz, and Chintala 2015). However, the representations produced by most of these techniques are entangled, without any notion of symbolic concepts. The exception to this is more recent work by Hinton et al. (Hinton, Krizhevsky, and Wang 2011) on \u2018transforming auto-encoders\u2019 which use a domain-specific decoder with explicit visual entities to reconstruct input images. Inverse graphics networks (Kulkarni et al. 2015) have also been shown to disentangle interpretable factors of variations, albeit in a semi-supervised learning setting. Probabilistic program induction has been recently applied for learning visual concepts in the hand-written characters domain (Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum 2015). However, this approach requires the specification of primitives to build up the final conceptual representations. The tasks we consider in this paper contain great conceptual diversity and it is unclear if there exist a simple set of primitives. Instead we propose to learn these concepts by observing consecutive frames, letting all the components of the hidden representation except a small discrete set (gating units) be\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n06 82\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n2 Fe\nb 20\n16\npredicted from the previous frame, and let the factors of variation in the next frame be represented entirely by these discrete gated units (corresponding to symbolic representations).\nMODEL\nThis model is a deep convolutional autoencoder (Hinton and Salakhutdinov 2006; Bengio 2009; Masci et al. 2011) with modifications to accommodate multiple frames and encourage a particular factorization in the latent space. Given two frames in sequence, xt\u22121 and xt, the model first produces respective latent representations ht\u22121 and ht through a shared encoder. The model then combines these two representations to produce a hidden representation h\u0303t that is fed as input to a decoder.\nWe train the model using a novel objective function: given the previous frame xt\u22121 of a video and the current frame xt, reconstruct the current frame as x\u0302t.\nTo produce h\u0303t, we introduce a gating in the encoder (see Fig. 1) that select a small set of gating units that characterize the transformation between xt\u22121 and xt. For clarity, in this paper we describe our model under the context of one gating unit. Concretely, the encoder learns to use a gating head that selects one index i of the latent representation vector as the gating unit, and then h\u0303t is constructed as ht\u22121, with the ith component of ht\u22121 swapped out for the ith component of ht.\nBecause the model must learn to reconstruct the current frame t from a representation that is primarily composed of the components of the representation of xt\u22121, the model is encouraged to represent the attributes of t that are different from that of xt\u22121, such as the lighting or pose of a face, in a very compact form that is completely disentangled from the invariant parts of the scene, such as the facial features. Thus, the model isolates the transformation from xt\u22121 to xt from other latent features via the component i selected by the gating head."}, {"heading": "CONTINUATION LEARNING", "text": "To learn the gating function, we use a technique first described in (W. Whitney 2016) for smoothly annealing a soft weighting function into a binary decision. Ordinarily, a model which produces a hard decision to gate through a single component (out of e.g. 200) would be difficult to train; in this case, it would require many forward passes through the decoder to calculate the expectation of the loss for each of the possible decisions. However, a model which uses a soft weighting over all the components can be trained with gradient descent in a single forward-backward pass.\nIn order to create a continuation between these two possibilities, we use a scheduling for weight sharpening (Graves, Wayne, and Danihelka 2014) combined with noise on the output of the gating\nhead. Given a weight distribution w produced by the gating head and a sharpening parameter \u03b3 which is proportional to the training epoch, we produce a sharpened and noised weighting:\nw\u2032i =\n( wi +N (0, \u03c32) )\u03b3\u2211 j w \u03b3 j\nThis formulation forces the gating head to gradually concentrate more and more mass on a single location at a time over the course of training, and in practice results in fully binary gating distributions by the end of training. This gating distribution thus selects a single component of ht to use in h\u0303t."}, {"heading": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"heading": "ATARI FRAMES", "text": "Our first dataset is frames from playing the Atari 2600 game Breakout. The model is given as input two frames which occurred in sequence, then reconstructs the second frame. This dataset was generated with a trained DQN network (Mnih et al. 2015). Since the model can only use a few components of its representation from the second frame, these components must contain all information necessary to predict the second frame given the first. For this dataset we use three gating heads, allowing three components of ht to be included in h\u0303t."}, {"heading": "SYNTHETIC FACES", "text": "We trained the model on faces generated from the Basel face model (Paysan et al. 2009) and prepared as in (Kulkarni et al. 2015). The input is two images of the same face between which only one of {lighting, elevation, azimuth} changes. For this dataset we use a single gating head, so the model must represent all differences between these two images in one unit only."}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We have shown that it is possible to train a model which learns a factorized, symbolic representation of the factors of variation in image sequences from raw data.
