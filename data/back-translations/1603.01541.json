INTRODUCTION", "text": "The reuse of texts is a well-known phenomenon in the Hebrew Bible. For example, in the book of Genesis we find various allusions to older Mesopotamian texts in the stories in the story of the flood [Hallo, 2003: 458-460]. There are also many cases of inner biblical intertextuality, such as the references to the story of Jacob and Esau in Hosea 1 and of course there exist numerous retellings of the Hebrew Bible in later ancient literature, such as the Genesis Apocryphon and the book of Jubilees, also called \u201cRewritten Scripture\u201d [Parry and Tov, 2004]. In this article we focus on parallel texts within the Hebrew Bible. There exists a lot of literature on this issue, but there is no open source online tool available yet with which it is possible to search for parallel texts and with which it is possible to present these parallels synoptically and online1. There is no fixed definition of what exactly parallel texts are. [Endres, Millar and Burns, 1998: ix] describes them as:\n1 There are various printed synopses. For a comparison of several of these, see [Verheij, 1992].\n\u201c\u2026more than one \u201ctext\u201d\u2014whether clauses, sentences, verses or longer sections\u2014manifest similar language, tone or structure. Parallels may be verbatim, nearly verbatim, structural, within the same book of the Bible, between different books of the Bible\u2026\u201d\nIn this research we will only study parallels with a certain minimal similarity of lexical characteristics. We developed a tool with which it is possible to find parallel texts within the Hebrew Bible and to visualize the results synoptically. In a similar we visualize the book of Isaiah in the MT and 1QIsaa. In section 2 the relevance of the study of parallel passages in the study of linguistic variation in Biblical Hebrew is described. The data, the software and the tool are described in section 3. The tool consists of two Jupyter notebooks, which can be found online2. They form an inseparable part of this article. In section 4 we take a closer look at a specific group of parallel texts, namely 2 Kings 19-25 and its parallels in the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and 2 Chronicles and we present a method by which it is possible to compare different manuscripts of the book of Isaiah."}, {"heading": "2. PARALLEL PASSAGES AND LINGUISTIC VARIATION IN BIBLICAL HEBREW", "text": "Parallel passages in the Hebrew Bible play an important role in reconstructing the development and growth of biblical texts and also in the study of the linguistic variation in the Hebrew language they are used often to explain diachronic change. In most studies on diachrony in Biblical Hebrew, Archaic Biblical Hebrew, Early Biblical Hebrew and Late Biblical Hebrew are distinguished3. According to this chronological model Archaic Biblical Hebrew can be found in several poems in the Hebrew Bible [S\u00e1enz-Badillos, 1993: 56-62] [Notarius, 2013]; the books of the Pentateuch and the Former Prophets4 are the best examples of Early Biblical Hebrew and the so called core late books5 are written in Late Biblical Hebrew. By comparing a characteristic late linguistic feature in one of the late books with its corresponding early alternative, scholars are able to uncover the chronological development of\n2 https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/tools?goto=parallel 3 For instance \u201cA History of the Hebrew Language\u201d by [S\u00e1enz-Badillos, 1993] is based on this division. 4 The Pentateuch consists of the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, the Former Prophets consist of the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. 5 The books of Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles are the core late books. Sometimes other books, like Qoheleth is also considered to be late by many, but not everyone is certain, see for instance [Hurvitz, 2014: 4] and [Young, 1993: 140-157]\nBiblical Hebrew. Very often scholars make use of examples in parallel texts, especially in the early books of Samuel and Kings and their late parallels in Chronicles to show this development. [Kropat, 1909] is a classic study of the syntax of the book of Chronicles in which this approach is followed consequently. A well-known example is the use of the prepositions \u05dc\u05d0 and \u05dc\u05e2.

Replication of results obtained by software is in general not easy, because the digital world is in constant flux and all software goes from version to version. To lower the barrier for effective replication we take care that our data is properly archived and our software is available as Open Source in online repositories with versioning.

A few years ago this database has been brought fully online as a research tool in the form of SHEBANQ (System for HEBrew text: Annotations for Queries and markup)8. On this website one can read the complete Masoretic Text (abbreviated as MT) according to the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia9.

The history of this Hebrew Text database is told by [Roorda, 2015] and more about the underlying models for processing text and data can be found in [Roorda and Van Peursen, 2016]."}, {"heading": "3.3. Chasing parallel passages", "text": "We use an algorithm to find parallel passages. This algorithm is implemented and documented in an executable notebook called Parallels, which is available from SHEBANQ13. Finding parallel passages is not easy. In the first place, the concept of a parallel passage has no clear-cut definition. Secondly, the notion of correspondence between parallel passages may involve characteristics that are difficult to compute from the text, e.g. semantics. And, thirdly, we have to tune our algorithm to the subtle boundary between too much and too little similarity. In the Parallels notebook we have chosen to base similarity on lexical characteristics only. We have defined two different ways of measuring such similarity, and used them both in a number of experiments (165 in total). We have used automatic indicators to evaluate the result of those experiments, which yielded 18 good outcomes. The present article is based on the parallels found by those \u201cgood\u201d experiments. The first step of our experiments consisted of chunking the Hebrew Bible. We made chunks of a fixed size (10, 20 50 or 100 words) and chunks related to objects in the database. In the latter case, each chunk consists of a sentence, a half-verse, a verse, or a complete chapter. After splitting the Hebrew Bible in chunks each chunk is compared with each other chunk, to be able to detect the similarity between these chunks. This was done in two ways. The first similarity method (called SET) works as follows. We take from both passages the set of lexemes. So we ignore order, multiplicity of occurrences, and the shapes of the concrete textual occurrences. We count the number of lexemes in the intersection and divide it by the number of lexemes in the union. If both passages use exactly the same lexeme set, the similarity is 1, and if they are based on totally different lexemes, their similarity is 0. If we require a significant level of SET similarity, (60 or more) we find indeed most of the known similarities. The second 11 http://laf-fabric.readthedocs.org 12 An overview of all sources is available at https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/sources . 13 https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/tools?goto=parallel\nsimilarity method (called LCS) is based on the Levenshtein distance of the two passages. This is a measure of how much editing is needed to transform one string into the other14. Finally, we searched for cliques, these are chunks with a similarity score above a certain threshold. We varied this threshold between 30% and 100%. The results of all these experiments can be found in the table of section 1. Results of the notebook. If we set our similarity threshold to high, we miss parallels. If we set it to low, we tend to get gigantic, drifting cliques, with unrelated passages connected by chains of \u201csimilar\u201d passages. We compare the outcomes for different choices of the similarity threshold, and we have an objective criterion for finding the sweet spot: the ratio between the number of cliques and the length of the longest clique.\nIn a second notebook, kings_ii15 we apply the techniques of finding parallel texts to our reference chapters, 2 Kings 19-25. We have used the SET method to make an inventory of all verses that are potentially parallel to our reference chapters in the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and 2 Chronicles. After that, we have applied the LCS method on all pairs of sentences in those verses, in order to study patterns in the differences between all those parallel verses."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS", "text": "In this section we discuss the results of our experiments, which are described in the notebooks. First the results in the Parallels notebooks are discussed, in which parallels in the complete Masoretic text are detected, then we describe the parallels of 2 Kings 19-25."}, {"heading": "4.1. The Parallels Notebook", "text": "The table in section 1. Results of the Parallels notebook shows the results of the experiments done. This table shows that using a fixed chunk size of a certain number of words did not lead to promising results. The best results were obtained by comparing chunks related to specific objects in the database (green areas can be found in the case of chunking in half-verses, verses, and chapters) and with a threshold that is not too low (in that case too many cliques are found) and that is not too high (then some good cases of parallel texts might be overlooked). These best results are colored green and in these cases we made binary chapter comparisons, which can be 14 A precise, mathematical description of the similarity methods can be found in the Parallels notebook, section 3.

In the chapter comparison one can find the complete chapters containing at least one clique with a colorful presentation of the similarities and differences of the verses in these chapters. For instance, in the experiment using verse chunks, method SET and threshold 85, we find the pair of chapters 2 Samuel 22 and Psalm 1816. This Song of David is a well-known parallel in the Hebrew Bible and in our presentation one can easily see where the similarities and differences are. In the chapter comparison identical parts are white, green and red indicates a plus in the text and yellow indicates a substitution. These pluses and substitutions are only a formal, computational indication, they do not mean that a certain scribe or editor added or changed parts of the text. In the index of the binary chapter comparison in the same experiment one can find most of the well-known parallels in the Hebrew Bible. It finds the parallels between Samuel, Kings and Chronicles, between Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7 and parallel texts in the Psalms, for instance Psalm 60 versus Psalm 108. It also finds more formulaic parallel verses, like Job 34:1/Job 35:1 and Job 38:1 and 3/Job 40:6-7. On the other hand, there exist also a number of parallels that are not detected by our tool. The parallel between 1 Chronicles 1:1-4 and Genesis 5:1-32 is not found and it is also directly clear why. In Chronicles these verses consist only of a list of proper names, whereas Genesis tells a short biography of each of these persons [Endres, Millar and Burns, 1998: 3-4] [Bendavid, 1972: 14-15]. This parallel is based on the order of the persons, instead of the lexical similarities in our chunks. Another example with which the tool has difficulties is 2 Kings 18:13-19:37 and Isaiah 36:1-22 on the one hand and 2 Chronicles 32: 9-23 on the other [Endres, Millar and Burns, 1998: 307-316] [Van Peursen and Talstra, 2007: 52:71]. It is clear that these parallels deal with the same events, Sennacherib\u2019s campaign, but the parallel texts strongly vary in their wording of the story. In some of our experiments the tool finds cliques17, but in the corresponding chapter comparison we do not find these similarities in a clear way18. Although there many overlapping results between the different experiments, there are also\n16 It can be accessed here: https://shebanq.ancientdata.org/shebanq/static/docs/tools/parallel/files/chapters/Samuel_II_22_vs_Psalmi_18.html 17 For instance in clique 1443 in: https://shebanq.ancientdata.org/shebanq/static/docs/tools/parallel/files/experiments/O_half_verse_SET_M50_S80/clique_O_half_verse_ SET_M50_S80_28.html#c_1443 18 https://shebanq.ancientdata.org/shebanq/static/docs/tools/parallel/files/chapters/Reges_II_18_vs_Chronica_II_32.html\ndifferences, so what is considered a parallel in one experiment is excluded in another experiment. This leads to the question what exactly is a parallel. The answer is that that depends completely on the needs and the questions of the researcher. One can imagine that for some kind of research one is interested in parallels that consist of two specific words occurring together. These parallels are generally excluded in our experiments, but it would be easy to write such a program with the use of LAF-Fabric. On the other hand, others might be interested in parallels that stretch over more verses. For that kind of research our tool generally works very well."}, {"heading": "4.2.

Visualization of 2 Kings and its parallels", "text": "First we have found out where all the parallel verses of 2 Kings 19-25 in the MT can be found and graphed the results. The similarity between parallel passages was based on verses and the similarity was based on the SET method, and a similarity higher than 60 is considered parallel. The results are graphed in figure 1, Parallels involving 2 Kings 19-25 in the notebook20. The backbone of this figure is formed by Reges_IIr, and a grey line from this column to one of the other columns indicates a parallel passage.

Also provided is a complete synoptic representation of all the parallel verses21. By playing with the similarity threshold in the program one can include or exclude passages. In the synoptic representation of the parallel verses one can see that many of the parallels are of a more or less formulaic nature, for instance in the case of Ezekiel 12:8, Jeremiah 37:6, and 19 For printed parallels of these texts in Hebrew with commentary, see [Person, 1997]. 20 https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/tools/parallel/kings_parallels.pdf 21 https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/tools/parallel/kings_parallels_h.html\nHaggai 1:322 and most of the parallels within the book of Kings23. There are also some parallels that are often not considered real parallels, for instance Deuteronomy 8:6 and Jeremiah 2:17, both parallel with 2 Kings 21:22. These examples show that the notion of what is parallel strongly depends on ones definition of parallel passages."}, {"heading": "4.2.2. The similarity of parallel passages", "text": "How similar are similar passages and how can various parallels be compared with each other quantitatively? In this section we would like to find out which of the parallels of 2 Kings 19-25 in the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Kings and Chronicles is closest to the text in the book of Kings. We do not presuppose that Kings is the earlier or original text, the focus lies exclusively on measuring the similarities. First all sentences were extracted in the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and 2 Chronicles that have a parallel in 2 Kings 19-25. Then a file was made in which the similarity of all sentences in 2 Kings 19-25, Isaiah 37-39, 2 Chronicles 33-34, and Jeremiah 52 are compared with each other24. Most sentences that are compared with each other in this file are not similar, but some are. We want to find out which of the groups of parallel passages are most similar.\nFigure 1 shows a boxplot of the similarities of all the relevant sentences in 2 Kings 19-25 on the one hand and the relevant sentences in Isaiah, Jeremiah and 2 Chronicles together on the other hand.\n22 These verses are parallel with 2 Kings 21:10. 23 For example 1 Kings 14:29, 15:7, 15:31, 16:5, 16:14, 16:27, 22:46, 2 Kings 8:23, 10:34, 12:20, 13:8, 13:12, 14:8, 15:6, 15:21, 15:26, 15:31, 15:36, 16:19 are all parallel with 2 Kings 21:17 and 1 Kings 15:11, 2 Chronicles 26:4, 29:2, 33:22, 2 Kings 14:3, 2 Kings 15:3, 15:34, 18:3, and Jeremiah 52:2 are all parallel with 2 Kings 23:32. 24 The file can be downloaded here: https://shebanq.ancientdata.org/shebanq/static/docs/tools/parallel/kings_similarities.tsv. The first four columns in this file define the first sentence in the comparison (book_1, chapter_1, verse_1, num_1), the variable num_1 stands for number of the sentence in the verse, the second four variables define the second sentence (book_2, chapter_2, verse_2, num_2). The last column indicates the similarity between the two sentences.\nThe median of all the values is 29 and the mean is with 29.26 pretty close to the median value. The violin plot in figure 2 shows the corresponding densities.\nThere is a very high density around the median value, which rapidly diminishes when higher or\nlower values are approached. The parallel sentences can be found in the region with a similarity higher than 60. In the violin plot one can see that this is only a small minority of the sentences. Figure 3 shows the results if the books are split, the situation is more or less identical to that of the previous boxplot, which indicates that the general distribution for each of the books are more or less identical.\nThe situation changes if the large bulk of data around the median is neglected and we select only those sentences with a similarity higher than 60. This is the region in which the parallel passages are found, and figure 4 is a boxplot of the books involved.\nThe medians of all three books are around 80, these do not differ very much. The upper part of the box of Isaiah is higher than that of the other books, which is an indication of a higher amount of very similar sentences. This becomes clearer if only those sentences are selected with a similarity higher than 80. Figure 5 shows the boxplot of this comparison.\nChronicles (similarity >= 80).\nIt shows that the similar sentences between Isaiah and 2 Kings 19-25 are far more similar to each other than the parallels between 2 Kings 19-25, Jeremiah and 2 Chronicles and this difference is significant25. The boxplots show the distribution of the similar values, but it is also striking to see that the number of verses with a similarity higher than 80, is far higher in Isaiah than in Jeremiah and 2 Chronicles26. We can conclude that there is a kind of base level of similarity between the biblical passages under consideration of 29, which is the median value. All books show more or less the same pattern around this median. It is only in the area of very high similarity (>= 80) that Isaiah is more similar its parallels in 2 Kings than the parallels in Jeremiah and 2 Chronicles. We can conclude that Isaiah has a relatively long parallel with 2 Kings and those sentences that are parallel are also very similar to their counterparts in 2 Kings27."}, {"heading": "4.2.3.

Jeremiah versus 2 Chronicles resulted in p = 0.5. We applied a Bonferroni correction (alpha = 0.05/3). 26 Of the group of sentences with a similarity higher than 80, Isaiah contains 182 sentences, Jeremiah contains 68 sentences, and 2 Chronicles contains 84 sentences. 27 Although on other grounds, this is also the opinion of [Van Peursen and Talstra, 2007]. 28 For printed texts of the scroll, see [Parry and Qimron, 1998], [Ulrich, 2010]. For a full digital facsimile, see http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah#. Here one can also find a parallel translation of the MT and the Great Isaiah Scroll: http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/chapters_pg. For the text with variants and commentary, see [Ulrich, Flint and Abegg, 2010]. An important study of the language of 1QIsaa is [Kutscher 1974]. 29 See: https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/tools/parallel/Isaiah-mt-1QIsaa.html\ncan be detected in a and we developed a way in which parallel passages can be studied synoptically online. With this approach we found most of the parallels that can be found in printed overviews of parallel texts. The parallel texts that were not found are those that are not based on lexical similarities, such as 1 Chronicles 1:1-4 and Genesis 5:1:32. An advantage of our approach is that it is completely reproducible. This gives other researchers also the possibility to adapt the experiments and synoptic representations in a way that fits their needs, which is an advantage over printed editions, in which always a certain choice has to be made for a specific kind of representation of the texts. More important than the visual representation of the parallels are the underlying data. If these are not generally accessible it is difficult to check how the data, the methods and the visualizations are related. Only if the data are open source this goal can be reached and in science this is the only scientific way to proceed. The work done in this project is not finished yet, in the sense that there are no improvements possible. We made visual representations of a few chapters of MT Isaiah and 1QIsaa, but it would be good if all Dead Sea Scrolls could be publicly available and easily comparable with the MT. Another issue is how more than two texts or manuscripts can be compared in an efficient way. In many traditional studies on textual development of the Hebrew Bible or diachrony in Biblical Hebrew very often the results are driven by presuppositions on how various texts are related to each other and how the Hebrew language has developed through time and how the text of the Hebrew Bible has been transmitted until the moment the manuscripts that we possess were created. With our research we would like to take a step back from these ideas and presuppositions to be able to study the data freshly in a way that is accessible to everyone. We hope that this research may be a stimulus for data driven research of the Hebrew Bible."}], "references": [{"title": "Parallels in the Bible, Carta (Jerusalem)", "author": ["A.
