These approaches often use different methods, representational formats or key ideas, making it sometimes difficult to compare them, e.g. with respect to the consequence relations they give rise to. Such comparisons are important to systematise the field of NMLs and to gain insights into which forms of defeasible reasoning are expressible in which formal frameworks. An important tool for such comparisons are translations between systems of NML. If one system (or a fragment thereof) is translatable into another system we immediately know that the latter system is at least as expressive as the former. Moreover, this may lead to forms of cross-fertilisation, since meta-theoretic properties become transferable between the translated systems.\nIn this contribution we will investigate several such translations. Given the richness of the domain of NMLs, we approach the topic from a specific angle. Our focus will be on structured argumentation, on the one hand, and NMLs that model defeasible inferences in terms of strict inference rules and defeasible assumptions, on the other hand.

While in abstract argumentation arguments are not phrased in a formal language and the underlying inferences are not explicated, several systems of structured or instantiated formal argumentation have been developed which overcome this limitation (cf. [5] for a partial overview). In this paper we will focus on two of the most prominent accounts: assumption-based argumentation (in short, ABA) [7, 10, 20] and ASPIC+ [16, 14].\nOne of the key differences between several formal approaches to defeasible reasoning concerns the question of how to model defeasible inferences. Let A1, . . . , An B denote the defeasible inference from A1, . . . , An to B. The question is whether such an inference should be phrased in terms of a strict inference rule or a defeasible one. A strict inference rule allows for no exceptions: if its premises A1, . . . , An are true, the consequent B is true as well. In contrast, defeasible rules allow for exceptions, that is, under specific circumstances it may hold that all premises A1, . . . , An of the rule hold while the consequent B doesn\u2019t. Clearly, in the approach with strict rules defeasibility has to enter in a different way. One way is by means of explicitly stated defeasible assumptions As1, . . . ,Asm, i.e., specific premises which are assumed to hold by default and which can serve as antecedents of strict rules. An inference is retracted in case there is a demonstration that one of the defeasible assumptions As1, . . . ,Asm doesn\u2019t hold.\nABA follows the approach based on strict rules and defeasible assumptions. In ASPIC+ both approaches can be represented. Not surprisingly, ABA has been shown to be translatable to ASPIC+ [16]. In this paper we will show the other (perhaps more surprising) direction, namely that ASPIC+ (without priorities) can be translated into ABA and thus that both frameworks are equi-expressive.\nThere are several nonmonotonic systems that model defeasible inference by means of strict rules. Among them are adaptive logics (in short, ALs) [4], Makinsons\u2019 default assumptions and forms of circumscription. Makinson\u2019s default assumptions \u2013and in view of the translation in [22] also ALs\u2013 are a generalisations of approaches based on maximal\nconsistent subsets [17]. In view of [1] we know that there are close connections between approaches based on maximal consistent subsets and structured argumentation. In this paper the ties will be strengthened. We show that ALs can be translated into ABA and ASPIC+ and present a translation in the opposite direction for a subclass of ABA and ASPIC+.\nWe will proceed as follows: in Sections 2\u20135 we introduce the basic systems (ALs, preferential semantics, default assumptions, ABA, and ASPIC+). In Sections 6\u20138 we provide translations as indicated in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "2 Adaptive Logics", "text": "ALs are a general framework for the formal explication of defeasible reasoning. It has been applied to a multitude of defeasible reasoning forms (mainly related to questions from philosophical logic), such as nonmonotonic forms of reasoning with inconsistent information, causal discovery, inductive generalisations, abductive hypothesis generation, normative reasoning, etc. (see [19, p.86] for an overview).\nThe driving idea behind ALs is to apply defeasible inference rules under explicit normality assumptions. More specifically, given a compact Tarksi logic L (the core or lower limit logic) in a formal language L and with the derivability relation \u22a2L, a set of abnormalities \u2126 \u2286 L is fixed. Now, whenever the core logic gives rise to \u0393 \u22a2L A \u2228 ab where ab \u2208 \u2126, A can be derived in the adaptive logic (based on L and \u2126) on the (defeasible) assumption that ab is false.1\nIn ALs this basic idea of modeling defeasible inferences is implemented in Hilbert-style proofs. We will first explain the proof theory of ALs.2 Then we give alternative characterizations of the adaptive consequence relations that are central to prove the adequacy of our translations in subsequent sections.\nIn ALs, usual Hilbert-style proofs are adjusted in two major ways. First, to keep track of normality assumptions, proof lines in adaptive proofs are equipped with an additional column in which the abnormalities are listed that are assumed to be false. Second, different retraction mechanisms for lines\n1The disjunction \u2228 is supposed to be classical. In fact, in the standard format of ALs which we consider here, the core logic is supposed to be supraclassical. Whenever non-classical logics are used as core logics, classical negation \u00ac and classical disjunction \u2228 are superimposed.\n2Due to spatial restrictions we will focus on the main ideas but explain some aspects of the proof theory (such as adaptive strategies) merely in a semi-formal way. For a more thorough explanation the interested reader is referred to [4, 19].\nwith abnormality assumptions that turn out mistaken are implemented in terms of so-called adaptive strategies. We will give some examples below.\nTo further explain how adaptive proofs work, it is useful to turn to a concrete example. As an illustration, we take a look at inconsistency-ALs. These are based on paraconsistent core logics such as LP or CLuN(s)3. These core logics typically do not validate disjunctive syllogism A,\u223cA \u2228B \u22a2 B since in case A is involved in a contradiction, B would not follow (then \u223cA would suffice for the disjunction \u223cA\u2228B to be true). Nevertheless, inconsistency-ALs allow for the defeasible application of disjunctive syllogism under the normality assumption that there is no contradiction in A. Hence, in inconsistency ALs the abnormalities in \u2126 typically have the form of a contradiction A \u2227 \u223cA. E.g., in paraconsistent core logics it usually holds that A,\u223cA\u2228B \u22a2 B\u2228 (A\u2227\u223cA) and thus one can defeasibly derive B under the assumption that there is no contradiction in A. Clearly, sometimes such assumptions turn out to be mistaken in view of the given premises. Obviously, this is the case if A \u2227 \u223cA is derivable from the given premises. A more interesting case is given, if A\u2227\u223cA is not directly derivable but it is derivable as a member of a minimal disjunction of abnormalities. We illustrate this in the following example.\nExample 1. Suppose our core logic is a standard paraconsistent logic such as LP or CLuN(s). Let \u0393 = {\u223cp,\u223cq, p \u2228 q, p \u2228 r, q \u2228 s}.\n1 \u223cp PREM \u2205 2 \u223cq PREM \u2205 3 p \u2228 r PREM \u2205 4 q \u2228 s PREM \u2205 5 p \u2228 q PREM \u2205 6 r \u2228 (p \u2227 \u223cp) 1,3,L-Inf \u2205 7 s \u2228 (q \u2227 \u223cq) 2,4,L-Inf \u2205 8 r 6,RC {p \u2227 \u223cp} 9 s 7,RC {q \u2227\u223cq} 10 r \u2228 s 8,L-Inf {p \u2227 \u223cp} 11 r \u2228 s 9,L-Inf {q \u2227\u223cq} 12 (p \u2227 \u223cp) \u2228 (q \u2227 \u223cq) 1,2,5,L-Inf \u2205\nEach proof line has 4 elements: a line number, a formula, a justification and a set of abnormalities (which are assumed to be false). All inferences of the core logic L can be applied (indicated by L-Inf in lines 6, 10, 11 and 12). In lines 8 and 9 defeasible inferences are made as explained above. E.g., since at line 6 r\u2228(p\u2227\u223cp) is derived, at line 8 the abnormality p\u2227\u223cp is considered false and thus put in the abnormality column. The rule employed for this is called RC (rule conditional): from (l;A \u2228 ab; \u2206) derive (l\u2032;A; l, RC; \u2206 \u222a {ab}). When further inferences are made calling upon lines with non-empty sets of abnormalities, these abnormalities are carried over (see lines 10 and 11 where the abnormalities of lines 8 and 9 are carried over).\nThe retraction of lines in adaptive proofs is always determined in view of the minimal disjunctions of abnormalities derived at a given stage of a proof (on the empty set of abnormalities). At line 12 such a minimal disjunction of ab-\n3CLuN(s) is positive classical logic enriched by the law of the excluded middle. For an axiomatization and a semantics see [3].\nnormalities is derived. Clearly, the abnormalities assumed to be false at lines 8\u201311 are involved in the given disjunction. There are different retraction mechanisms for ALs: so-called adaptive strategies. According to the reliability strategy, any line with an abnormality in the assumption that is part of a minimal disjunction of abnormalities is to be retracted. Retraction is implemented by marking lines that are retracted. In this case:\nX 8 r 6,RC {p \u2227 \u223cp} X 9 s 7,RC {q \u2227\u223cq} X 10 r \u2228 s 8,L-Inf {p \u2227 \u223cp} X 11 r \u2228 s 9,L-Inf {q \u2227\u223cq}\nThere are other, less cautious, strategies. For instance, according to the minimal abnormality strategy, r \u2228 s will not be retracted. The reason is as follows. If we interpret our premises strictly as normal as possible, then in view of line 12 it will be the case that either p \u2227 \u223cp holds (and q \u2227 \u223cq doesn\u2019t), or q\u2227\u223cq holds (and p\u2227\u223cp doesn\u2019t). In each case, one of the assumptions of line 10 or 11 is warranted. Due to space limitations, we omit the technical details. Yet another strategy is normal selections. According to it a line with the set of abnormalities \u2206 is retracted (or marked) once \u2228\n\u2206 is derived on the empty condition.\nThese retraction mechanisms provided by adaptive strategies make AL proofs dynamic: sometimes a line may get marked, later unmarked, and yet later marked again. In order to define a consequence relation we need a stable notion of derivability. It works as follows: a formula at a line l of a proof is finally derived at a stage of the proof if l is not marked and every extension of the proof in which it gets marked can be further extended such that it is unmarked again. The consequence relation of ALs is the defined as follows:\nDefinition 1. Let L be a compact Tarski logic in the formal language L, let \u2126 \u2286 L be a set of abnormalities, and let str \u2208 {r,ma, ns} be an adaptive strategy (reliability, minimal abnormality, or normal selections). Where\u0393\u222a{A} \u2286 L, \u0393 \u22a2\u2126,Lstr A iff A is finally derivable in an adaptive proof from \u0393.\nFor our translations alternative characterisations of the consequence relations defined in terms of final derivability in Definition 1 will be very useful. These characterisations are essentially informed by the set of minimal disjunctions of abnormalities derivable from a given premise set by the core logic L.\nDefinition 2.

We also assume that the core logic L comes with an adequate model-theoretic semantics and an associated semantic consequence relation L.

In [13, chapter 2], it is also shown that many other non-monotonic consequence relations, such as Reiter\u2019s Closed World Assumption, Poole\u2019s Background Constraints, etc. can be expressed as DACRs. DACRs give formal substance to the idea that, in many situations, non-monotonic reasoning makes use of a set \u2206 of defeasible background assumptions in combination with the strict and explicit premises in \u0393. These background assumptions are used to the extent that they are consistent with \u0393. Accordingly, DACRs make use of the notion of maximal consistent subset:\nDefinition 5. Where \u0393 \u222a \u2206 \u2286 L, \u0398 \u2286 \u2206 is a maximal \u0393-consistent subset of \u2206 iff:\n\u2022 \u0393 \u222a\u0398 6\u22a2L A for some A \u2208 L and \u2022 \u0393 \u222a\u0398\u2032 \u22a2L A for all A \u2208 L and for every \u0398 \u2282 \u0398\u2032 \u2286 \u2206.\nMCS(\u0393,\u2206) is the set of all maximal \u0393-consistent subsets of \u2206.\nDefinition 6.

Given a rule system, an assumption-based framework is defined as follows:\nDefinition 10 (Assumption-based framework).

However, since attacks are only possible \u2018on\u2019 assumptions, these formulations are equivalent (cf. also [20]).\noperating on the level of equivalence classes consisting of arguments generated using the same assumptions.\nDefinition 11 (Attacks).

On the basis of argumentative attacks, semantics determine sets of assumptions that are acceptable given different criteria of acceptability, such as the requirement that a given set of assumption should not attack itself, or it should be able to defend itself against attacks by other sets of assumptions. Argumentation semantics have been phrased for abstract frameworks in [8] and have been generalised to the level of ABA in e.g. [7].\nDefinition 12 (Argumentation semantics).

Given an assumption-based framework ABF = ((L,R),\u0393, Ab, ) and sem \u2208 {niv, prf, stb}:\n\u2022 ABF \u22a2\u222a sem A iff \u0393\u222a\u2206 \u22a2R A for some \u2206 \u2208 sem(ABF). \u2022 ABF \u22a2\u2229sem A iff \u0393\u222a\u2206 \u22a2R A for every \u2206 \u2208 sem(ABF). \u2022 ABF \u22a2\u22d3sem A iff \u0393 \u222a \u22c2 {\u2206 | \u2206 \u2208 sem} \u22a2R A.\n5 ASPIC+\nIn ASPIC+, as in ABA, inferences made on the basis of a strict knowledge base can be extended with additional inferences based on plausible assumptions. However, whereas in ABA attacks and extensions where defined directly on the level of these assumptions, in ASPIC+, arguments are specific deductions. More precisely, arguments are constructed\nfrom a knowledge base using an argumentation system. An argumentation system is a generalisation of a deductive system (Def. 7) that allows for a distinction between strict (i.e. deductive or safe) and defeasible rules.7\nDefinition 14 (Defeasible Theory). Given a formal language L, a defeasible theory R = (L,S,D) consists of (where A1, . . . , An, B \u2208 L):\n\u2022 a set of strict rules S of the form A1, . . . , An \u2192 B \u2022 a set of defeasible rules D of the form A1, . . . , An \u21d2 B.\nWe also assume there is a naming function N : S \u222a D \u2192 L s.t. every rule r \u2208 S \u222a D gets assigned a unique name. A1, . . . , An are called the antecedents and B is called the consequent of A1, . . . , An \u2192 B resp. A1, . . . , An \u21d2 B.\nDefinition 15 (Argumentation System). Given a defeasible theory R, an argumentation system is a tuple AS = (R, ) where is a contrariness function from L to 2L.\nArguments are built by using defeasible and/or strict rules to derive conclusions from a knowledge base. A knowledge base consists of strict and plausible premises. Kn is the set of all (necessary) axioms, i.e. premises that are considered to be outside the reach of argumentative attacks. Ka has an analogous function to the defeasible assumptions in ABA: they are deemed plausible in that they are assumed to be true unless and until a counterargument is encountered.\nDefinition 16 (Knowledge Base). A Knowledge Base is a set K, where K = Kn \u222aKa and Kn \u2229 Ka = \u2205.\nDefinition 17 (Arguments). Let AS = (R, ) be an argumentation system and K = Ka \u222a Kn a knowledge base. An argument a is one of the following:\n\u2022 a premise argument \u3008A\u3009 if A \u2208 K \u2022 a strict rule-argument \u3008a1, . . . an 7\u2192 B\u3009 if a1, . . . an (with n > 0) are arguments such that there exists a strict rule conc(a1), . . . conc(an) \u2192 B \u2208 S.\n\u2022 a defeasible rule-argument \u3008a1, . . . an \u21db B\u3009 if a1, . . . an (with n > 0) are arguments such that there exists a defeasible rule conc(a1), . . . conc(an) \u21d2 B.\nWe will use Arg(AS,K) to denote the set of all arguments that can be built from a knowledge base K using an argumentation system AS.\nExample 3. Let S = {\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp}, D = {\u00acp \u21d2 s}, Kn = {\u00acs}, and Ka = {\u00acq,\u00acp, q}. We have, e.g., the following arguments:\na1 = \u3008\u00acq\u3009 a4 = \u3008a3 \u21db s\u3009 a7 = \u3008\u00acs\u3009 a2 = \u3008\u00acp\u3009 a5 = \u3008a2 \u21db s\u3009 a3 = \u3008a1 7\u2192 \u00acp\u3009 a6 = \u3008q\u3009\n7In the ASPIC+ framework of [16], there is also the possibility to add a preference ordering over the premises and/or defeasible rules. Similar generalisations exist for ALs and approaches based on maximal consistent subsets and their generalisations such as Makinsons\u2019 default assumptions. We will present investigations into translations for systems with priorities at a future occasion. In our presentation, we also disregard a special type of premise called \u2018issue\u2019 in the context of ASPIC+. Issues are premises that are never acceptable in the sense that they always require further backup by additional arguments.\nDefinition 18. Where a is an argument a = \u3008B\u3009, a = \u3008a1, . . . an 7\u2192 B\u3009 or a = \u3008a1, . . . an \u21db B\u3009, we define:\n\u2022 conc(a) = B\n\u2022 sub(a) = sub(a1) \u222a . . . \u222a sub(an) \u222a {a}\n\u2022 where a is a premise argument: prem(a) = {A}\n\u2022 where a is not a premise argument: prem(a) = {prem(a\u2032) | a\u2032 \u2208 sub(a)}.\nThe distinction between strict and defeasible rulearguments allows us to define a variety of attack forms:\nDefinition 19 (Attacks). Where a, b \u2208 Arg(AS,K), a attacks b (in signs, a b) iff\n\u2022 conc(a) \u2208 B for some B \u2208 prem(b)\u2229Ka (Undermining).\n\u2022 conc(a) \u2208 B\u2032 for some b\u2032 \u2208 sub(b) such that conc(b\u2032) = B\u2032 and b\u2032 is of the form \u3008b\u20321, . . . , b \u2032 n \u21db B \u2032\u3009 (Rebut). \u2022 conc(a) = b\u2032 for some b\u2032 \u2208 sub(b) such that b\u2032 is a defeasible argument (Undercut).\nExample 4 (Ex. 1, contd). Where A = {B | B \u2261 \u00acA} for every A \u2208 L, we have: a1 a6, a6 a1, a6 a3, a6 a4, a7 a4, a7 a5.\nDefinition 20 (Structured Argumentation Framework). A structured argumentation framework AT = (Arg(AS,K), ) is a pair where Arg(AS,K) is the set of arguments built from K using the argumentation system AS and is an attack relation over Arg(AS,K).\nGiven a structured argumentation framework, we can again make use of Dung\u2019s argumentation semantics to define different notions of acceptable sets of arguments.\nDefinition 21 (Argumentation Semantics). Given a structured argumentation framework AT = (Arg(AS,K), ), where B \u2286 Arg(AS,K),\n\u2022 B is conflict-free iff there is no a, b \u2208 B such that a b\n\u2022 B is naive iff it is maximally conflict-free.\n\u2022 B defends a \u2208 A iff for every c \u2208 A for which c a, there is a b \u2208 B such that b c.\n\u2022 B is admissible iff it is conflict-free and it defends every argument a \u2208 B\n\u2022 B is preferred iff it is maximally (w.r.t. set inclusion) admissible.\n\u2022 B is stable iff it is conflict-free and for every a \u2208 Arg(AS,K) \\ B, B a.\nWe write niv(AT), prf(AT) resp. stb(AT) for the set of naive, preferred resp. stable sets of arguments in AT.\nDefinition 22. Where AT = (Arg(AS,K), ) is a structured argumentation framework and sem \u2208 {niv, prf, stb},\n\u2022 AT \u22a2\u222a sem A iff there is an a \u2208 B with conc(a) = A for some B \u2208 sem(AT).\n\u2022 AT \u22a2\u2229sem A iff for every B \u2208 sem(AT) there is an a \u2208 B with conc(a) = A.\n\u2022 AT \u22a2\u22d3sem A iff there is an a \u2208 B with conc(a) = A for every B \u2208 sem(AT)."}, {"heading": "6 Translating Adaptive Logic to Assumption-Based Argumentation", "text": "The idea of the translation from ALs to ABA is the following. We translate the lower limit logic L of the given AL into a deductive system, plausible assumptions are negations of abnormalities, and the contrariness operator is classical negation. Recall that the lower limit logic is a supraclassical Tarski logic. Hence, there are classical negation \u00ac and classical disjunction \u2228 in the underlying language of L. In the remainder of this section we will use \u00ac and \u2228 denoting these classical connectives.\nWe now go through the technical details of our translation.\nDefinition 23. Let AL be an AL with the lower limit logic L in a formal language L and the consequence relation \u22a2L, the set of abnormalities \u2126 \u2286 L and a strategy str (reliability, minimal abnormality, or normal selections). Let L be characterised by the rules in R and the axiom schemes in A. We the define the assumption based framework ABF\u2126L(\u0393) for the premise set \u0393 \u2286 L as the tuple ABF\u2126L(\u0393) = ((L,R(L)),\u0393, Ab\u2126, ) where:\n\u2022 R(L) contains all instances of rules in R and a rule \u2192 A for all instances A of axiom schemes in A;8\n\u2022 Ab\u2126 = {\u00acA | A \u2208 \u2126}\n\u2022 : Ab\u2126 \u2192 L, where \u00acA = A\nBelow we show the following representational theorem:\nTheorem 6. Where \u0393\u222a{A} \u2286 L and sem \u2208 {niv, prf, stb},\n1. ABF\u2126 L (\u0393) \u22a2\u222a sem A iff \u0393 \u22a2\u2126,L ns A 2. ABF\u2126L(\u0393) \u22a2 \u2229 sem A iff \u0393 \u22a2 \u2126,L ma A 3. ABF\u2126 L (\u0393) \u22a2\u22d3 sem A iff \u0393 \u22a2\u2126,L r A.\nTo avoid clutter we introduce some notational convention:\nNotation 1. Where \u2206 \u2286 \u2126, \u2206\u00ac = {\u00acA | A \u2208 \u2206} and \u2206\u00ac = \u2206.\nThe following fact follows immediately in view of the compactness and the transitivity of L.\nFact 2. Where \u0393 \u222a {A} \u2286 L, \u0393 \u22a2R(L) A iff \u0393 \u22a2L A.\nIn view of this fact, we will indiscriminately use \u22a2 as \u22a2R(L) and \u22a2L. Note that in view of the supraclassicality of L we have:\nFact 3. \u0393 \u222a\u2206\u00ac \u22a2 A iff \u0393 \u22a2 \u2228 \u2206\u00ac \u2228 A.\nWe now established that every instantiation of an AL is indeed an assumption-based framework. We prove that the three consequence relations of ALs correspond to intuitive ways of calculating consequences in ABA. The crucial result to prove this is the fact that every preferred extension in some assumption-based framework ABF\u2126L(\u0393) is exactly the set of negations of abnormalities excluding some choice set over the derivable abnormalities. This is shown in the following lemmas.\nLemma 1. Where \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6L(\u0393), Ab\u2126 \\ \u03c6\u00ac is stable in"}, {"heading": "ABF", "text": "\u2126 L(\u0393).\n8If no axiomatisation of L is given, we can proceed more brute force and set R = {A1, . . . , An \u2192 A | {A1, . . . , An} \u22a2L A}.\nProof. We first show that \u2206\u00ac = Ab\u2126 \\ \u03c6\u00ac is conflict-free. Assume for a contradiction that it is not and hence that there is a B \u2208 \u2126 for which \u0393\u222a\u2206\u00ac \u22a2 B,\u00acB. Hence, by the compactness of L and Fact 3, \u0393 \u22a2 \u2228\n\u0398 for some finite \u0398 \u2286 \u2206. Let \u0398 be \u2282-minimal with this property. Hence, \u0398 \u2208 \u03a3L(\u0393). However, then \u03c6 \u2229\u0398 6= \u2205, a contradiction.\nWe now show that \u2206\u00ac is stable. For this, let \u00acB \u2208 Ab\u2126 \\ \u2206\u00ac. Hence, B \u2208 \u03c6. With Fact 1.2, there is a \u0398 \u2208 \u03a3L(\u0393) such that {B} = \u03c6 \u2229 \u0398. Since \u0393 \u22a2 \u2228\n\u0398, by Fact 3 also \u0393\u222a (\u0398\u00ac \\ {\u00acB}) \u22a2 B. By the monotonicity of L, \u0393\u222a\u2206\u00ac \u22a2 B which means that \u2206 attacks B.\nSince\u2206\u00ac is conflict-free and attacks everyA \u2208 Ab\u2126\\\u2206\u00ac, it is easy to see that \u2206\u00ac is closed and stable.\nExample 5 (Ex. 1 contd). Take Ab\u2126 = {\u00ac(A \u2227 \u223cA) | A \u2208 LCLuN} and R an adequate rule system for CLuN. Where \u0393 = {\u223cp,\u223cq, p \u2228 q, p \u2228 r, q \u2228 s}. There are two stable extensions: Ab\u2126 \\{\u00ac(p\u2227\u223cp)} and Ab\u2126 \\{\u00ac(q\u2227\u223cq))}. To see this observe that e.g. \u0393 \u222a {\u00ac(q \u2227 \u223cq)} \u22a2CLuN p \u2227 \u223cp.\nLemma 2. If \u2206\u00ac \u2286 Ab\u2126 is conflict-free in ABF \u2126 L (\u0393) then there is a \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6L(\u0393) for which \u2206 \u2286 \u2126 \\ \u03c6. Proof. Suppose \u2206 6\u2286 \u2126 \\ \u03c6 for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6L(\u0393) and \u2206 \u2286 \u2126. By Fact 1, \u2126 \\ \u2206 is not a choice set of \u03a3L(\u0393). Thus, there is a \u0398 \u2208 \u03a3L(\u0393) for which \u0398 \u2286 \u2206. Since \u0393 \u22a2 \u2228\n\u0398, also \u0393 \u222a (\u0398 \\ {A}) \u22a2 \u00acA for any A \u2208 \u0398. Thus, \u0393 \u222a \u2206 is not L-consistent since \u0393\u222a\u2206 \u22a2 A,\u00acA by monotonicity. By Fact 2, \u0393 \u222a \u2206 \u22a2R(L) A,\u00acA and thus, \u2206 is not conflict-free in"}, {"heading": "ABF", "text": "\u2126 L (\u0393).\nWith Lemmas 1 and 2 we immediately get:\nLemma 3.

In view of Lemma 3 it is enough to show the theorem for sem = stb.\nAd 3. ABF\u2126L(\u0393) \u22a2 \u22d3 stb A iff \u0393 \u222a \u22c2 {\u2206 | \u2206 \u2208 stb(ABF\u2126L(\u0393))} \u22a2 A. By Lemma 1, this is the case iff \u0393 \u222a \u22c2\n{(\u2126 \\ \u03c6)\u00ac | \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6L(\u0393)} \u22a2 A. Since \u22c3\n\u03a6L(\u0393) = \u22c3\n\u03a3L(\u0393) (which is easy to see and left to the reader), this is equivalent to \u0393\u222a (\u2126\\ \u22c3 \u03a3L(\u0393)) \u00ac \u22a2 A. By compactness, monotonicity and Fact 3, this is equivalent to \u0393 \u22a2 A \u2228 \u2228 \u2206 for some finite \u2206 \u2286 \u2126 \\ \u22c3\n\u03a3L(\u0393). By Theorem 2 this is equivalent to \u0393 \u22a2\u2126,Lr A.\nAd 1. and 2. Analogous.\nTranslating Adaptive Logic to ASPIC+\nIn [16] we have a translation from ABA to ASPIC+. Although this translation requires several assumptions that"}, {"heading": "ABF", "text": "\u2126 L (\u0393) does not satisfy, it turns out that it is easy\nto prove that any ABF\u2126 L (\u0393) can easily be translated to an assumption-based framework that does satisfy these assumptions.\nThe underlying idea is basically the same as that for translating AL into ABA: the plausible knowledge base consists of the negated abnormalities, the strict premises of the ASPIC+ framework are the premise set \u0393 and the strict rules\nof the ASPIC+ framework are the inference rules of the monotonic core logic. Due to spatial restrictions, we are not able to present the full technical details of this translation and the adequacy results here.\n7 Translating ASPIC+ to Assumption-Based Argumentation\nIn this section we translate ASPIC+ to ABA. Since in ABA we have no defeasible rules and less attack types than in ASPIC+ the possibility of this translation is less expected than the translation in the other direction (as provided in [16]). In this section we thus offer an answer to the open question stated in [14] whether such a translation can be given. Our translation works as follows:\nDefinition 24. Where AS = (R, ) is an argumentation system in the formal language L with a naming function N for the rules in R and K = Kn \u222a Ka is a knowledge base, we translate AS into an assumption-based framework ABF(AS) = ((L\u2032,R),Kn, Ab, ) as follows9\n\u2022 L\u2032 \u2287 L is such that L\u2032 \\ L contains for each r in R a unique name n(r) and its contrary n(r);10\n\u2022 R contains each strict rule from R and for each defeasible rule r : A1, . . . , An \u21d2 A it contains11\n\u2013 the rule n(r), A1, . . . , An \u2192 A\n\u2013 the rule A \u2192 n(r) \u2022 Ab = Ka \u222a {n(r) | r is a defeasible rule in R}\nBelow we will show that the translation is adequate in view of the following corollary:\nCorollary 1. Where AT = (Arg(AS,K), ) is a structured argumentation framework and sem \u2208 {stb, prf},\n1. ABF(AS) \u22a2\u222a sem A iff AT \u22a2\u222a sem A 2.

ABF(AS) \u22a2\u22d3\nsem A iff AT \u22a2\u22d3 sem A.\nIn the following we suppose a given argumentation system AS and its translation ABF(AS) as in Definition 24.\nDefinition 25. Where \u2206 \u2286 Ab, Arg\u2206 \u2286 Arg(AS,K) is the set of all arguments a that use only defeasible assumptions in \u2206, any strict rules, and only defeasible rules r for which n(r) \u2208 \u2206.\nWhere A \u2286 Arg(AS,K) is a set of arguments,AbA \u2286 Ab is the set of assumptions consisting of (1) defeasible assumptions A \u2208 Ka for which prem(a) = A or conc(a) = A for\n9For simplicity, we will assume that the contrariness function of the ASPIC+-framework assigns a unique contrary to every A \u2208 L. If this assumption is not satisfied, one has to add Ac1 \u2192 \u2212A, . . . , A c n \u2192 \u2212A for every A c i \u2208 A\u0304, where \u2212A \u2208 L \u2032\\L is the contrary of A in ABA, as suggested by [20, p.109]. 10Formally: L\u2032 \\ L = {n(r) | r in R} \u222a {n(r) | r in R} (where\n{n(r) | r in R} \u2229 {n(r) | r in R} = \u2205). This warrants that, unlike the names N(r) \u2208 L used in AS, the new names n(r) are not antecedents and consequents of rules in R. We use the new names to \u2019simulate\u2019 defeasible rules in ABA.\n11We suppose that the rules in R are instances as opposed to schemes. The translation can easily be adjusted to schemes.\nsome a \u2208 A and (2) of n(r) where r is a defeasible rule used in some argument in A.\nWhere A is a set of arguments in Arg(AS,K), A\u22c6 denotes the set ArgAbA .\nWe sometimes write Aba instead of Ab{a}.\nFact 4.

Proof. This can be shown by an induction on the length of a deduction from Kn \u222a\u2206 to A. Base step: this is trivial since A \u2208 K. Inductive step. We have three possibilities: 1. A is the result of applying a strict rule r in R to A1, . . . , An, or\n2. A is the result of applying the translation of a defeasible rule r = A1, . . . , An \u21d2 A \u2208 R to A1, . . . , An and the rule name n(r), or\n3. A = n(r) is the result of applying a rule B \u2192 n(r) where B is the consequent of the defeasible rule r in R. Ad 2. By the induction hypothesis there are arguments ai (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) s.t. ai \u2208 Arg\u2206 and conc(ai) = Ai. (Note here that Ai /\u2208 L\u2032 \\ L.)

Suppose there are a and b \u2208 A\u22c6 s.t. a attacks b. For each attack form it is easy to see that then there is a b\u2032\u2032 \u2208 A s.t. a attacks b\u2032\u2032. Take, for instance, rebuttal. Then conc(a) = B \u2032 where B\u2032 = conc(b\u2032) for some b\u2032 \u2208 sub(b). Hence, there is a defeasible rule r which is applied in b\u2032 to produce B\u2032. By the definition of ArgAbA there is an argument b\u2032\u2032 \u2208 A s.t. r is applied to produce conc(b\u2032\u2032) = B\u2032. For the other attack types (undercuts and undermines) this is shown in an analogous way. Now, since A is admissible, there is a c \u2208 A s.t. c attacks a. Since by Fact 4, c \u2208 A\u22c6, also A\u22c6 is defended. To show that A\u22c6 is conflictfree, assume for a contradiction that a \u2208 A\u22c6. Since a attacks b\u2032\u2032 \u2208 A, A attacks a (due to the admissibility of A). However, in view of the fact that A and A\u22c6 make use of the same defeasible assumptions and defeasible rules and A attacks a in one of the two, this leads to a selfattack in some argument a\u2032 \u2208 A. E.g., suppose A undermines a in some B \u2208 prem(a). Then B \u2208 AbA. Hence there is an argument a\u2032 \u2208 A with B \u2208 prem(a\u2032) and A attacks a\u2032. Since A is conflict-free, this is a contradiction.\nLemma 6. Where A = A\u22c6 \u2286 Arg(AS,K), AbA is closed.\nProof. Suppose A = A\u22c6 and Kn \u222a AbA \u22a2R A for some A \u2208 Ab. We have two possibilities: (1) A = n(r) for some r in R or (2) A \u2208 Ka. Ad 1. Since there are no rules with consequent n(r), n(r) \u2208 AbA. Ad 2. By Lemma 4, there is an a \u2208 A\u22c6 = A with conc(a) = A. Hence, by the definition of AbA, A \u2208 AbA.\nLemma 7. Where A = A\u22c6 \u2286 Arg(AS,K), if A is admissible then AbA is admissible.\nProof. Suppose A = A\u22c6. By Lemma 6, AbA is closed. Suppose AbA is not conflict-free. Hence, Kn \u222a AbA \u22a2R A for some A \u2208 AbA. We use Lemma 4 according to which we have two cases. Case 1: there is an a \u2208 A\u22c6 s.t. conc(a) = A. Since A = A\u22c6, a \u2208 A and A is not conflict-free. Case 2: A = n(r) and there is an a \u2208 A for which conc(a) = B where B is the consequent of r. Since n(r) \u2208 AbA, there is an argument a\u2032 \u2208 A which uses rule r to produce conc(a\u2032) = B and which is thus rebut-attacked by a. Again, A is not conflict-free. Thus, we have shown (by contraposition) that if A is conflict-free then AbA is conflict-free.\nSuppose A is admissible, \u2206 is closed and attacks AbA. Hence, Kn \u222a \u2206 \u22a2R A for some A \u2208 AbA. By Lemma 4 we have two cases. Case 1: there is an a \u2208 Arg\u2206 s.t. conc(a) = A. Hence, A 6= n(r) for any r \u2208 R. Clearly, a attacks A. Since A is admissible, there is a b \u2208 A s.t. b attacks a. Then Abb \u2286 AbA and Kn \u222a Abb \u22a2R conc(b). Thus, Abb attacks Aba and hence AbA attacks \u2206.\nCase 2: A = n(r) and there is an a \u2208 Arg\u2206 s.t. conc(a) = B where B is the consequent of r. In this case there is an a\u2032 \u2208 A which uses rule r and hence conc(a\u2032) = B. Since A is admissible, there is a c \u2208 A that attacks a. But then \u2206c \u2286 AbA attacks \u2206a and hence AbA attacks \u2206.\nLemma 8. If \u2206 \u2286 Ab is admissible, then Arg\u2206 is admissible.\nProof. Similar to the previous proof.\nTheorem 7. 1. If \u2206 is preferred (resp. stable) then Arg\u2206 is preferred (resp. stable).\n2. If A is preferred (resp. stable) then \u2206 is preferred (resp. stable) for some \u2206 \u2287 AbA for which Arg\u2206 = A.\nProof. Ad.1 Suppose \u2206 is preferred. Then, by Lemma 8, Arg\u2206 is admissible. Suppose there is an A\n\u2032 \u2283 Arg\u2206 that is admissible, then by Lemma 7, also AbA\u2032 is admissible. Since \u2206 \u2282 AbA\u2032 this is a contradiction.\nAd.2 Suppose A is preferred. By Lemma 5 and since trivially A \u2286 A\u22c6, A = A\u22c6. By Lemma 7, AbA is admissible. Now suppose that there is a \u2206 \u2283 AbA that is admissible. Then by Lemma 8, Arg\u2206 is admissible. Clearly A \u2286 Arg\u2206. By the maximality of A, A = Arg\u2206.\nDue to space limitations we omit the proof for stable extensions.\nCorollary 1 follows directly with Theorem 7, Lemma 4 and Fact 5."}, {"heading": "8 Translating Assumption-based Argumentation to Adaptive Logic", "text": "In this section we will translate a fragment of assumptionbased argumentation to adaptive logic.\nIn the following we write ABAAbR (\u0393)for the assumptionbased framework ((L,R),\u0393, Ab, ).\nFor our translation we will use some connectives from Kleene\u2019s well-known 3-valued logic K3 (see Table 1) and superimpose them on a logic that is characterised by the rules in R.

In this conclusion we discuss some benefits.\nIn view of the translation of ALs into ABA we know that ALs can be understood as forms of formal argumentation. In view of the fact that ALs are equi-expressive with the syntactically characterised preferential semantics in Sec. 3 and Makinson\u2019s default assumptions, the same can be said about the latter two frameworks. Since a broad variety of defeasible reasoning forms in a wide range of application contexts have been explicated within the ALs family (see Sec. 2), all these reasoning forms are now available in the domain of formal argumentation. This may lead to further refinements. For instance, once embedded in ASPIC+ we gain rich resources to express preferences and priorities.\nIn view of the other direction, from a subclass of ABA to ALs, we know that this class can be understood in terms of the model-theoretic tools provided by KLM-style preferential semantics or, alternatively, as consistency management in terms of maximal consistent subsets as provided by default assumptions. This also means that meta-theoretic insights from, for instance, ALs become available for this subclass of ABA. For example, the computational complexity of ALs is well-understood [23, 15]. Moreover, properties of the AL consequence relations apply to this class of ABA. For instance, we know that adaptive consequence relations are cumulative (in the notation of Section 2, where AL is an adaptive logic, \u0393,\u2206, {A} \u2286 L, and \u0393 \u22a2AL B for all B \u2208 \u2206, \u0393 \u22a2AL A iff \u0393 \u222a \u2206 \u22a2AL A). For a study of meta-theoretic properties of ALs see [4, 19]. Finally, besides the available dialogue-based methods to model argumentative reasoning processes (e.g. [9]), now the dynamic proof theory of adaptive logics can also be used for this purpose.\nFinally, we complete the circle between ABA and ASPIC+ (without priorities/preferences) by providing a translation from the latter to the former, whereas the other direction has been presented in [16]. As a side-product this provides a way to phrase the defeasible rules of ASPIC+ as strict rules. This shows that the strict fragment of ASPIC+ (without strict rules and thus without rebuttals and undercuts) is equi-expressive with full ASPIC+. Such\ninsights are conceptually interesting and may simplify future meta-theoretic investigations into ASPIC+.\nIn future work we intend to generalise our investigations to approaches with priorities and preferences as provided in ASPIC+ and some generalisations of ALs. An interesting question will be, for instance, whether full ASPIC+ is translatable into lexicographic ALs [19, ch.5] or whether the latter can be translated to ABA or ASPIC+."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "In this paper we make a contribution to the unification of formal models of defeasible reasoning. We present several translations between formal argumentation frameworks and nonmonotonic logics for reasoning with plausible assumptions.
