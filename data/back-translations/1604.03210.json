Fuzzy Logic\n1.1.1. Concept of fuzzy logic\nFuzzy logic has its real significance in several aspect such as fuzzy language, fuzzy control theory, information processing, computer science, medical diagnosis and so on.\nThis fuzzy logic has been developed since making the classical binary logic vague. For a long time, mathematical logic has been existed as a pure theory, but in the late of 1930\u2019s the practical value appeared obviously. First, it was used in design of switch circuit and then became the important basis of computer science and automatic control theory as computer developed. However, because a preposition in binary logic has only 2 values: true and false, it is inconvenient for emulation of the human thinking.\nObjective things are not absolutes only with true and false, and there is much transitional state between true and false and this shows vagueness. Because human being have intelligence processing the objects with vagueness smoothly, so they can think generally and parallel and then they have ability applying the summarization, abstraction, intuition and thinking creatively. Therefore the task to search the formulation problem of natural language was suggested and under this premise fuzzy logic also has been developed.\nFuzzy logic is the branch that generalized the use of connection operation in mathematical logic and selection of value in truth table, and its development shows its powerful vitality by combined with the computer science. In computer manufacturing, mainly \u300aminimization of logic operation\u300b is studied and in\nprogram, mainly study on approximation reasoning is used in artificial intelligence.\nThe characteristics of fuzzy logic are as follows: \u2460 Truth value is vague, that is a proposition may have any value between\nrange [0, 1].\n\u2461 Truth value can be generated by given grammar. \u2462 Using truth value can have meaning according to the grammatical rule. \u2463 It has meaning that the truth value can be changed as local logic. \u2464 Reasoning rule is natural, not certain. Here, \u2461 and \u2462 are the problems related with fuzzy language, and \u2460\uff0c \u2463 and \u2464 are the one related with fuzzy logic, so we have to understand the meaning considering the contents described in fuzzy logic.\n1.1.2. Fuzzy Proposition\nIn binary logic, each proposition has only two values: true \u300a1\u300b and false \u300a0\u300b. A proposition is expressed with the symbol and formulas having the standing rules, so study on formulation of logic proposition has became to convert to the change of certain symbols and formulas.\nFuzzy proposition is a kind of symbolic logic and can be said the generalization of general proposition. In fuzzy logic, the value which a fuzzy proposition has doesn\u2019t express the \u300atrue\u300b and \u300afalse\u300b, but expresses the degree of them. Therefore, the truth value can be all the real number ranging in interval [0, 1]. And fuzzy logic is widely used in controlling the complicated production process, using the switch theory, information process, approximation reasoning, and fuzzy\nlanguage.\n[Definition 1.1.1] Fuzzy proposition is the sentence having the vagueness. In\nother words, proposition is defined as the proposition which truth value is in [0, 1].\nIn general, proposition is expressed in the form of \u300ax is A\u300b, where x is called subject, and A is called predicate. The difference between the fuzzy proposition and general proposition is that the its predicate is expressed in the form of fuzzy set.\nFuzzy proposition is denoted as symbols . ,,, ~~~ RQP\n(Example 1.1.1)\n\uff1a \u300ax is a small positive number\u300b ~ P\n~ Q \uff1a \u300aMiss. Pak is very strong.\u300b\n~R \uff1a \u300aIt is very hot today\u300b\nIn the above example, \u300ais a small positive number\u300b, \u300ais very strong\u300b and \u300ais very hot\u300b are all the fuzzy concepts and they are expressed as fuzzy set. Therefore fuzzy proposition is corresponded to the fuzzy set.\nArithmetic of truth value of fuzzy proposition is the one of the membership\nfunction.\nFuzzy union , fuzzy intersection   and complement  are defined as\n(1.1.1), (1.1.2) and (1.1.3).\n),max( ~~~~ QPQP  (1.1.1)\n),min( ~~~~ QPQP  (1.1.2)\n.1 ~~ PP  (1.1.3)\nThen we can obtain the following result for the logic operations . ,,  \nHere, we refer to the fuzzy proposition having value in [0, 1], and\ndenote to \u00b7,\nP Q R~ ~ ~, ,\n  to \uff0d.\n\u2460 Commutativity\n~~~~~~~~ , PQQPPQQP  (1.1.4)\n\u2461 Idempotency\n~~~~~~ , PPPPPP  (1.1.5)\n\u2462 Involution\n~~ PP  (1.1.6)\n\u2463 Associativity\n~~~~~~ )()( RQPRQP  (1.1.7)\n~~~~~~ )()( RQPRQP  (1.1.8)\n\u2464 Absorption\n~~~~~~~~ )( ,)( PQPPPQPP  (1.1.9)\n\u2465 Distributivity\n~~~~~~~ )( RPQPRQP  (1.1.10)\n).()()( ~~~~~~~ RPQPRQP  (1.1.11)\n\u2466 De Morgan\u2019s law\n~~~~~~~~ )( ,)( QPQPQPQP  (1.1.12)\n\u2467 Zero element\n00 ,0 ~~~  PPP (1.1.13)\n\u2468 Identity\n~~~ 1 ,11 PPP  (1.1.14)\n\u2469 Complementary law\n0 ,1 ~~~~  PPPP (1.1.15)\nIn some cases, we may denote the complementary law as\n2 1 , 2 1 ~~~~  PPPP (1.1.16)\nFrom the above equations, the following equations are held.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~ )( QPPQPPQQPPPP  (1.1.17)\n)()()( ~~~~~~~~~~~~ QPPQPPQQPPPP  (1.1.18)\nIf the truth value of fuzzy proposition on each point of object set X is not\nless than\n~ P\n , that is\n~P (1.1.19)\nthen fuzzy proposition is defined as ~P  always true proposition where\n]1,0[ .\nEspecially when 1 , it becomes the always true proposition.\n1.1.3. Basic knowledge of fuzzy reasoning.\nIn binary logic, reasoning sentence \u300aIf ~ then ~\u300b is the conditional proposition\nand is denoted as symbol \u300a \u300b. P Q\nThe truth value is as follows.\nP 1 1 0 0\nQ\nP Q\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\nBecause the truth value table of proposition \u300a \u300b and the \u300a \u300b are\nthe same, (1.1.20) is held.\nP Q  P Q\nQP  QP (1.1.20)\nWhen and are fuzzy proposition, is called approximation\nreasoning sentence (fuzzy reasoning sentence).\n~P Q~ P Q~ ~\nFor example, if\nP~ : \u300aIt is clear.\u300b\nQ ~ : \u300aIt is warm\uff0e\u300b\n, then \u300a \u300b means \u300aIf it is clear, it is warm\u300b, and \u300aQ \u300b means \u300aIf\nit is warm, it is clear.\u300b\nP Q~ ~~ P~ ~~\nP Q   P Q\nGeneralizing the P Q   P Q as the fuzzy proposition,\nP Q~ ~   P Q~ ~\nTherefore, when proposition \u300ax change the litmus paper into red color\u300b is\nexpressed using the set by using a syllogistic; we should consider the objective space to two factors: one is \u300achemical property\u300b and the other is \u300acolor\u300b.\nNow, consider the approximation reasoning (fuzzy reasoning) related with two\nobject space X Y,\n~~ QP  (1.1.21)\nTo simplify, first consider the general proposition .

And complement term with\nall the variables is called complement minimum term.\nFor example, term 3221 xxxx  on is complement minimum term, but V3\n221 xxx  is not complement minimum term.\nGiven two fuzzy logic expressions and , when the following (1.2.2) is held for any element a, we can describe that contains , and equation (1.2.3) is\nheld.\n1F 2F\n1F F2\n)()( 21 aFaF  (1.2.2) 21 FF  (1.2.3)\nEspecially, in (1.2.2), when  and  are terms, Iff every character in  is in ,  contains  .

This is denoted as FPI.\n)() aFa(  (1.2.4)\nThe form with the least characters among the addition normal form of fuzzy\nlogic functions is called fuzzy simplest form.\nHere, the following property is held. When F is the fuzzy main addition normal form, all single items in F are the FPI of\nF.\nBy using the above property, given the fuzzy addition normal form , we can\nfind FPI of single item . That is, if single item\nF\nF  in isn\u2019t contained in\nother single item, it has already been FPI of . So, it is the problem to find the FPI of complement item.

As we can see on the above consideration, one fuzzy logic function is expressed as FPI to decrease the number of characters. That is, fuzzy simplest form is expressed as the sum of FPI.\nThere are two cases in FPI of fuzzy logic function F, one is in simplest form of F, and the other is not in any simplest form. Some properties related with this are described as follows.\nIf FPI  is in all simplest form of fuzzy logic function F,  is called\nindispensable item and the other is called dispensable item.\nFrom this definition, the following 2 properties are held. 1\u00b0 If a certain single item  is FPI of fuzzy logic function F,  is\nindispensable item of F.\n2\u00b0 If  is fuzzy consistency of  and  when single items  ,  and complement item  are FPI of fuzzy logic function F, then  is dispensable\nitem of F.\nFrom the above properties, we can realize that it is not necessary to obtain the fuzzy consistency of single items to obtain the simplest form of fuzzy logic function.\nComputing algorithm 1\u00b0 Obtain all FPIs obtained by calculating the fuzzy consistency of items which\nat least one is complement item, and refer them to n ,,, 21  .\n2\u00b0 Calculate the fuzzy main addition normal form.

For example, word such as dog, horse, white, beautiful and so on are all original words.\nCompound words can be made from words, and it was composed by applying the logic operations \u300a\u300b, \u300a and \u300a \u300b to the language in the view of mathematical logic. And operations \u300a\u300b, \u300a and \u300a \u300b are corresponding to \u300a \u300b, \u300a \u300b and \u300a  \u300b in set theory. So it is possible to make the compound word with words and decompose the compound word into words. Compound words can be expressed in the way of bracketing the words as follows.\nWhite horse\uff1d[horse] [white]\uff0c \nEast north\uff1d[east] [north]\uff0c\nbrothers\uff1d[elder brother] [younger brother]\uff0c \ndesk and chair\uff1d[desk] [chair]\uff0c \nnonmetal\uff1d[metal]\nHedge of language can be done by introducing the concept of operator on the basis of set theoretical expression of language. For example, we can consider \u300aextremely\u300b, \u300avery\u300b, \u300acomparatively\u300b, \u300aquite\u300b, \u300amore or less\u300b, \u300aalmost\u300b,\n\u300aprobably\u300b and so on as operators.\n1.3.2. Language variable\nLanguage variable is the generalized concept of fuzzy variable. Fuzzy variable is characterized as the three dimensional pair , where X is the name of variable\uff0cU is the set of objects, and is the restriction. Restriction\nis the fuzzy set in U determined by fuzzy variable X. If is general\nset, then it becomes the variable that has been used in mathematics. Like this, fuzzy variable is the generalization of variable.\n( , , ( : ))X U R X u\nR X u( : )\nR X u( : ) R X u( : )\nLanguage variable is denoted as , where restriction is the whole\nof various fuzzy subsets in object set.\n( , , ( : ))X U R X u\nFor example, consider the adjective \u300apretty\u300b. This is the word that indicates the external characteristics of a certain object. This is considered as an expression of fuzzy set restricting the fuzzy variable named \u300apretty\u300b. Applying rhetoric such as \u300avery\u300b, \u300anot\u300b, \u300aextremely\u300b, \u300aquite\u300b and so on to the fuzzy set \u300apretty\u300b, new fuzzy sets such as \u300avery pretty\u300b, \u300aextremely pretty\u300b, \u300anot pretty\u300b and \u300aquite pretty\u300b. Such fuzzy sets are the values of language variables such as fuzzy\nset \u300apretty\u300b.\nA main characteristic of language variable is that language variable selects the\nfuzzy variable as its value.\nFor example, language variable \u300aage\u300b, expressing the age, can have the following values. \u300ayoung\u300b, \u300anot young\u300b, \u300aold\u300b, \u300avery old\u300b, \u300anot young and not old\u300b and \u300aquite old\u300b. Here \u300ayoung\u300b is the name of fuzzy variable\nreflecting the meaning \u300ayoung\u300b, and \u300aold\u300b is meaning \u300aold\u300b.\nReferring X to the name of fuzzy variable, restriction decided by X is the\nmeaning of X.\nFor example, restriction decided by fuzzy variable \u300aold\u300b is the fuzzy set\ndefined in like (1.3.1). U  [ , ]0 100\nR u u u U( ) ,old      \n \n   \n \n 1 505 2 50\n100 1\n(1.3.1)\nFuzzy set expressed by can be considered that it has the meaning\n\u300aold\u300b.\nR(old)\nThe other characteristic of language variable is that it is combined according to\nthe following two rules.\nS\u2460 yntactic rule: this means the algorithm for generating the name of value of\nvariable.\nS\u2461 emantic rule: this is the rule to decide the algorithm for calculating the\nmeaning of each value.\nThese rules are the essential parts reflecting the characteristics of structural\nvariable.\nLanguage variable is characterized as 5 dimensional pair as follows.\n),,),(,( MGUNTN (1.3.2)\nIn (1.3.2), N is the name of variable, and is the noun set of N, that is,\nthe syntactic rule for generating the value name X of N.\n)(NT\nM is the semantic rule for expressing the meaning of X as the fuzzy set in U.\nEspecially, X that is the name generated by grammar G is called noun. Noun that has a function, composed with one or more words is called basic\nnoun, and noun consisted of one or more basic words is called compound noun.\nReferring to the nouns of T, T is denoted as follows. X X1 2, , \nT X X  1 2 \nWhere T may be expressed as when it is necessary that T was generated by grammar G. The meaning of noun X is defined as (1.3.3) so as to be the restriction decided by fuzzy variable X. T G( ) M X( ) R X( )\n)(xM  )(XR (1.3.3)\nThis means that is the fuzzy set representing the meaning of X. R X( )\n(Example 1.3.1) Consider the language variable \u300aAge\u300b.\nLanguage value of \u300aAge\u300b may be \u300aold\u300b and \u300aold\u300b is the basic noun. And it has the other value \u300avery old\u300b, which is compound noun. Besides this, there are many elements of noun set of \u300aAge\u300b.\nT(Age)=old + very old + not old + more or less young + quite young + not\nvery old and not very young+ \u2026\nwhere each noun is the name of fuzzy variable in U  [ , ]0 100 . Then the meaning of\n\u300aold\u300b is given as (1.3.4).\nuuM 1100\n50\n2\n5 501)old(\n\n   \n\n           (1.3.4)\nOr simply,\nuu 1100\n50\n2\n5 501old\n\n   \n\n           (1.3.5)\nSimilarly, the meaning of language value of \u300avery old\u300b can be described as\nfollows.\nuuM 2100\n50\n2\n5 501oldveryold)(very\n\n   \n\n           (1.3.6)\n(Example 1.3.2) Consider the language variable \u300aNumber\u300b.

When given language variable N, its noun set and M is characterized\nalgorithmically, the language variable N is called structural language variable.\n)(NT\nIn this sense, syntactic rule combined with the structural language variable can\nbe considered as the algorithm for calculating the meaning of each noun in . )(NT\n(Example 1.3.3) Consider the role of syntactic and semantic rules of structural\nlanguage variable using the language variable \u300aAge\u300b.\nNouns of \u300aAge\u300b are \u300aold\u300b, \u300avery old\u300b, \u300avery very old\u300b. Therefore,\nnoun set of \u300aAge\u300b can be denoted as follows.\nT(Age)=old + very old + very very old + \u2026\nIt is certain that in the simple case, each noun of is one of \u300aold\u300b or\n\u300avery old\u300b.\n(Age)T\nInduct this rule in general way. Denote the connection of x and y as yx  . If old,very  yx , then\n. oldveryxy\nIf are the sets of rows, that is A B,\n\n  \n21\n21 yyB xxA\n, then connection of A and B is denoted as AB, and is defined as the following set.\n ij ji yxyyxxAB ))(( 2121 \nFor example, if oldveryold,very  BA , then\noldveryveryoldveryold)veryvery(old AB\nUsing such expression method, we can make the solution of the\nfollowing equation.\n(Age)T\nT=old + very T (1.3.7)\n(1.3.7) can be solved using the following recursion equation.\n,2,1,0,veryold1  iTT ii (1.3.8)\nSetting the initial value of Ti to empty set 0,\n\noldveryvery+oldvery+old oldvery+old\nold 0\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n\n\n T T T T\n(1.3.9)\nAs result, solution of equation is as follows.\n  oldveryveryoldveryoldTT (1.3.10)\nIn this example, syntactic rule is expressed by (1.3.7) and its solution is\nobtained as follows.\nConsidering that (1.3.7) is algebraic expression, syntactic rule can be expressed\nas the following generation system.\noldT (1.3.11) oldveryT (1.3.12)\nIn this case, noun of T is obtained using the above generation rule. That is, if T\nis very T and, if T is old in very T, then noun very old is obtained.\noldvery veryvery veryvery veryveryveryvery  TTTT .\n(1.3.13)\nNext, consider the semantic rules for \u300aAge\u300b. To compute the meaning of noun such as very \u2026 very old, first it is necessary to know the meaning old and very, where noun old is the initial value. That is, to compute the meaning of compound noun in T, at least the meaning of old must be characterized as the initial data.\nNoun very has the role of modification. Suppose that very has the rule of\nconcentration operator, the approximation of very is expressed as follows.\nvery old = CON(old) = old2 (1.3.14)\nAs result, semantic rule of Age is expressed as follows.\nM (very \u2026 very old)  old2n\nwhere n is the number of very in very \u2026 very old. If basic noun old is\nuu 1100 50 2 5 501old                  (1.3.15)\n, then\nM(very \u2026 very old) uu n2100\n50\n2\n5 501\n\n   \n\n           \uff0c ,2,1n (1.3.16)\nThis equation offers the semantic rule for computing the meaning of compound\nnoun that basic noun old is generated by equation T=old + very T by modifier very.\nNext, consider the boolean language variable used very conveniently in\napplication.\nBoolean language variable is the following type of language variable. That is, X\nis the boolean expression of variables that has the type of \uff0c or hX, where\nh is language modifier, is noun, and hX is the name of fuzzy set obtained by\napplying h to X.\npX phX\nXp\nnot very young and not very old\nFor example, in the above expression, h is very, is young and old.\nSimilarly, in very very young, h is very very, and is young.\nXp\nXp\n(Example 1.3.4) Refer Age to the boolean language variable having the\nfollowing noun set.\nT(Age)=young + not young +old +not old + very young + not young and not\nold + young or old + young or( very young and not very old ) + \u2026 Then, the meaning of typical value of Age can be described as follows.\nM (not young) = T(young), M (not very young) = T (young2), M (not very young and not very old) = T (young2) T (old 2), M (young or old) = T(young old) \nThese expressions show that the meaning of compound noun is expressed by\nthe meaning of basic nouns. So If young and old are as follows,\nyoung uuu  \n  \n\n          \n100\n25\n1225 0 5 251/1 (1.3.17)\nold uu \n  \n\n           100 50\n12\n5 501 (1.3.18)\nThen\nM(young or old)    \n\n           \n\nuuu 50\n25\n1225 0 5 251/1\nuuu 12100\n50\n12\n5 501 5 251\n\n  \n\n                           (1.3.19)\n1.3.3 Language Hedge\nWe explain the language hedge as the operator converting one fuzzy set such as\n\u300avery\u300b to the other fuzzy set for example modifier named as much, more or\nless, rather.\nTo discuss the language hedge, we must consider the operations about fuzzy set, which is square operation, concentration, dilatation, contrast, standardization, fuzzification and so on.

By inserting the natural language to the algorithm language, computer will be able to deal with the fuzzy concept and serve better for the human, comprehending the human intelligence. Such a computer language is called fuzzy algorithm language.\nTo make a computer understand and process the fuzzy concept, we must select\nthe object space first of all.\nIn general, we select the set of real number or its subset as the object space and\ndefine basic word such as \u300asmall\u300b, \u300alarge\u300b, \u300along\u300b, \u300ashort\u300b, \u300aheavy\u300b and \u300alight\u300b on the object space. And then by adding the fuzzy modification operators, we obtain \u300avery large\u300b, \u300aquite light\u300b, \u300amore or less small\u300b and so on, and adding fuzzy set operators \u300a\u300b and \u300a\u300b, obtain \u300aneither large nor small\u300b, \u300alarger or comparatively large\u300b and so on.\nProgramming these concepts, we can obtain value setting statements and\nprogram the fuzzy condition statements.\nSometimes, the result computed using the fuzzy algorithm language may be fuzzy, and in this case, it is possible to convert the fuzzy result to the definite one, by using the  level set.\nWe consider the fuzzy algorithm language FSTDS (Fuzzy Set Theory Data\nSystem).\nThere are 52 kinds of operation symbols in FSTDS and they can be divided into\n8 kinds.\nO\u2460 peration symbol configuring the set There are \u300aSet\u300b and \u300aFset\u300b.\n\u300aSet\u300b configures the general set and \u300aFset\u300b does fuzzy set. For example,\nSet represents the set and Fset),,( cba },,{ cba       ca 8.0,1.0 represents the set\ncba A 8.001.0  .\nAssignment operation symbol.\u2461 This is the operation symbol named fuzzy set, and there is assignment symbol\n\u300a:=\u300b, it is also written as \u300aAssign\u300b.\nO\u2462 peration symbol on the same kind of fuzzy set\n\u300aUnion\u300b\uff0c\u300aIntersection\u300b\uff0c\u300aProd\u300b(product)\uff0c\u300aAsum\u300b(algebraic sum)\uff0c\n\u300aBsum\u300b(boundary sum)\uff0c\u300aBdif\u300b(boundary difference)\nO\u2463 peration symbol on fuzzy relation\n\u300aCompose\u300b(composition), \u300aConverse\u300b(converse), \u300aImage\u300b(image)\uff0c\u300b\nDomain\u300b(domain)\nR\u2464 elational operation symbol\n\u300aEQ\u300b(equal), \u300aSubset\u300b(subset), \u300aElement\u300b(element)\nO\u2465 ther operation symbol\n\u300aCut\u300b(select the  -level set), \u300aEXP\u300b(exponent), \u300a#\u300b(number of elements),\n\u300aDlt\u300b(delete)\nBy using these operation symbols, we expand the function of FSTDS.

Premise 2: This tomato is very red.\nConsequent: This tomato is well ripe. Like this, it is very interesting to formulize the method that can do fuzzy\nreasoning mechanically in the view of natural language processing.\nBut, such reasoning is difficult by using the classical reasoning rule of binary logic. Therefore, new reasoning rule, compositional rule of reasoning was formulated and on the basis on it, fuzzy reasoning (approximate reasoning) was introduced.\nFuzzy reasoning is the reasoning deriving a certain new fuzzy proposition from\nseveral fuzzy propositions, and it is similar to the reasoning of human, so it can be applied to various branches such as fuzzy control, expert system, decision making and so on.\nReasoning is done by using the logic phenomenon such as \u300aIf P then Q\u300b\n(this is called implication.) (P Q )\nFirst, consider the logic operation .
