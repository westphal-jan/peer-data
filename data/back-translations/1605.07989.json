Then the following equality holds:\nMx = D (1)\nThe integer solution x\u2217 to this system of linear equations with the least |x\u2217| gives a lower bound on the operator counts required to solve the planning problem, i.e. |x\u2217| \u2264 |\u03c0\u2217|.

Further, M is problem independent, and hence the factor Z = Q\u22122MT (MQ\u22122MT )\u22121 can be precomputed given an action model. Thus it follows that we can readily use ||QZD|| as a heuristic for state-space search.\nNote that this formulation can also determine infeasibility of goal reachability immediately (in domains where actions are not reversible this is extremely useful) when the system is unsolvable, as shown in Algorithm 1. Unfortunately, the use of the l2-norm, that helps us in obtaining the closed-form polynomial bound heuristic, also makes the heuristic inadmissible."}, {"heading": "Sparse coding.", "text": "Since operator counts are integers, we would ideally want an integer solution to Eqn 4 (which makes the problem computationally intractable). Unfortunately, the polynomial bound Lagrangian method described above does not address this aspect giving rise to bad heuristic values for certain section of problems. To describe this problem geometrically, we consider a planning domain with two compliant operators (of unit cost), such that x =< x1, x2 >. If the plane inscribed by Mx = D in the two dimensional space is close two either of the axis, the l2 norm calculated above results in small fractional values, and hence a less informed heuristic.

But the l2 minimization results in small fractional values with x1 = 0.77 and x2 = 0.77, and the heuristic values of hl2 = 1.54 instead of |\u03c0\u2217| = 3.\nThus, we propose a different approximation method to obtain integer values for individual operator counts, remaining within the polynomial time bound.\nWe notice that in most cases n \u226b m and also n \u226b |x\u2217| due to the combinatorial explosion during grounding of domains. Thus, we propose an operator count heuristic that exploits this knowledge about the sparsity of x\u2217. Ideally, we would like to solve the following problem,\nmin |x|l0 s.t. Mx = D\nx 0\nsince minimizing the l0 norm results in the sparsest solution. But, we encounter two problems. Firstly, the optimal operator counts (x\u2217), although sparse, might not be the sparsest solution. Secondly, minimizing the l0 norm is NP-hard [5].\nThus, we draw upon compressed sensing techniques to enforce a level of sparsity when computing the vector x. To this end, we suggest minimization of l1-norm (l1-LP) or weighted l1-norm (\u03c9-l1-LP) [4] to enforce positive integer solutions.\nGeometrically, as can be seen in figure 2 these norms produce a more informed heuristic (hl1 = 1.60 and h\u03c9\u2212l1 = 3.4) for the aforementioned problem. This method tries to compress (minimize) the norm ball (or box for that matter) as much as possible till it fits in the plane Mx = D. The operator (dimension) that induces a tighter constraint (x1 in our case), limits the expansion of the norm ball, producing a less informed heuristic (hl1 = 1.60). The weighted l1-norm method addresses this problem by minimizing the l1-norm and iteratively penalizing the increase along the tightest dimension till convergence is reached or maximum number of iterations are achieved, resulting in a more informed heuristic (h\u03c9\u2212l1 = 3.4).\nFor \u03c9-l1-LP, we empirically observe that rounding up the individual operator counts produce a more informed heuristic. Thus, we arrive at a polynomial time proxy for integer solutions."}, {"heading": "Evaluations.", "text": "The table shows the evaluation of the proposed heuristics across a total of 83 problems from five well-known unit cost planning domains. Each entry in the table represents the percentage difference in the initial state heuristic value and the optimal plan length averaged across the problems in each domain. The %-compliance column shows the average number of goal compliant predicates in the problems. Rows 1-3 show the performance of our heuristic on the original domains (\u2018-\u2019 indicates that the heuristics could not be computed due to absence of any goal complaint variables). Rows 3-6 show the performance in domains where the %-compliance was increased (this was done by identifying instances in the action model where variables assume a don\u2019t care condition, i.e. a value of -1, and replacing it with appropriate values as entailed by domain axioms). Finally, rows 6-9 show the performance of our heuristics in problems with more completely specified goals (which results in higher percentage compliance). As expected, our heuristic performs better as %-compliance increases across a particular domain.

For example, in an adversarial setting, if an agent \u03b12 wanted to stop \u03b11 from executing its plan, all it needs to do is to ensure that \u2203\u03b7 s.t. \u03c0\u03b11(\u03b7) + \u03c0\u03b12(\u03b7) > |\u03b7|.
