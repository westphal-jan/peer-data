Currently the project is run by around\nten members representing different organizations; namely,\nAIST, TDU, and University of Tsukuba 2. Reading\ninternational conference papers clearly provides various advantages other than gaining an understanding of\nthe current standing of your own research, such as ac-\nquiring ideas and methods used by researchers around\nthe world. In reality, however, although this input of\nknowledge is important, researchers and engineers are too busy to have time to do it, and the process takes\nHirokatsu Kataoka Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan Tel.: +81-29-861-2267 E-mail: hirokatsu.kataoka@aist.go.jp\n1 Further reading: Twitter @CVPaperChalleng (https://twitter.com/cvpaperchalleng), SlideShare @cvpaper.challenge (http://www.slideshare.net/cvpaperchallenge) 2 In 2016, we are now around 30 members including the University of Tokyo and Keio University.\na great amount of time and effort for undergraduate and graduate students (particularly masters course stu-\ndents) who lack research experience and entails sacri-\nficing their time for classes and research. Assigning this\nwork, however, to non-experts who are not familiar with\nthe field of computer vision, results in a great amount of time needed for interpreting the papers. As a way\nto address this problem, we believe that we can make\nit relatively easier to grasp advanced technologies if we\nshare and systematize knowledge using the Japanese language. We therefore undertook to extensively read\npapers, summarize them, and share them with others\nworking in the same field. The IEEE-sponsored Con-\nference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\n(CVPR) is known as the premier conference in the field of computer vision, pattern recognition, and related\nfields. CVPR, which is held annually in the U.S., has\non average around 20% acceptance rate for submitted\npapers, making it a very difficult conference to hurdle, and pointing to the high quality of the accepted papers.\nAlso, CVPR is also known to comprehensively cover pa-\npers in the different fields in computer vision and pat-\ntern recognition. A number of prominent international\nresearchers and research groups choose their research themes after a comprehensive grasp of almost all papers\npresented in premier conferences and an understand-\ning of research trends. We believe that the accuracy\nby which research themes are chosen can be improved by constantly being updated on cutting-edge technolo-\ngies and discussing these new technology trends within\nthe research groups as part of their regular activities.\nFurther, a survey of papers presented in premier con-\nferences is also an essential way to gather tools needed for research. We therefore believe that gaining an un-\nderstanding of papers presented in premier conferences\nis the best method for authors to comprehend the lat-\nest trends in computer vision, pattern recognition, and\nrelated fields. As the first step of this endeavor, we\nundertook to read all the 602 papers accepted dur-\ning the CVPR2015 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,\n15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32, 33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,\n51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,\n69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,\n87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103, 104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,\n117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,\n130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,\n143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,\n156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168, 169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,\n182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,\n195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,\n208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220, 221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,\n234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,\n247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,\n260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,\n273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285, 286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295,296,297,298,\n299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310,311,\n312,313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,\n325,326,327,328,329,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,337, 338,339,340,341,342,343,344,345,346,347,348,349,350,\n351,352,353,354,355,356,357,358,359,360,361,362,363,\n364,365,366,367,368,369,370,371,372,373,374,375,376,\n377,378,379,380,381,382,383,384,385,386,387,388,389,\n390,391,392,393,394,395,396,397,398,399,400,401,402, 403,404,405,406,407,408,409,410,411,412,413,414,415,\n416,417,418,419,420,421,422,423,424,425,426,427,428,\n429,430,431,432,433,434,435,436,437,438,439,440,441,\n442,443,444,445,446,447,448,449,450,451,452,453,454, 455,456,457,458,459,460,461,462,463,464,465,466,467,\n468,469,470,471,472,473,474,475,476,477,478,479,480,\n481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488,489,490,491,492,493,\n494,495,496,497,498,499,500,501,502,503,504,505,506,\n507,508,509,510,511,512,513,514,515,516,517,518,519, 520,521,522,523,524,525,526,527,528,529,530,531,532,\n533,534,535,536,537,538,539,540,541,542,543,544,545,\n546,547,548,549,550,551,552,553,554,555,556,557,558,\n559,560,561,562,563,564,565,566,567,568,569,570,571, 572,573,574,575,576,577,578,579,580,581,582,583,584,\n585,586,587,588,589,590,591,592,593,594,595,596,597,\n598,599,600,601,602]. This review summarizes all the\npapers of CVPR2015 we read as the first project of\ncvpaper.challenge. In this paper, we will describe the characteristics of CVPR2015 and discuss the trends and\nleading methods used in three areas; namely, recogni-\ntion, 3D, and imaging/image processing. Further, we\nwill enumerate the proposed datasets and new research\nproblems presented at the conference and propose the\nconcept of \u201cDeepSurvey\u201d. Finally, we will give a sum-\nmary and discuss future steps. We would like to stress,\nhowever, that this paper mainly focuses on a survey of the research trends, and does not cover the details of\nall the 602 papers, which are beyond the scope of this\npaper."}, {"heading": "2 Related initiatives and positioning of this project", "text": "An example of a related initiative is the Japanese CHI\nStudy Group that undertook to read all the papers pre-\nsented at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors\nin Computing Systems, the top conference for user interfaces [603]. In 2015, the Study Group was held jointly\nin Tokyo and Hokkaido using a remote conference sys-\ntem to read within one day all the 485 papers presented\nat CHI2015. Speakers were assigned one session each and introduced one paper in approximately 30 seconds.\nThe CHI Study Group started in 2006, and is on its\n10th year in 2015. This initiative is a very effective way\nto grasp trends in the user interface domain, which is\na very progressive field. It is noteworthy that several Japanese researchers have received the Best Paper and\nHonorable Mention awards at CHI2015.\nConsidering the rapid progress in the field, the au-\nthors focused on \u201creading all the papers included in\nthe international conference and summarizing trends through the project,\u201d as well as on listening to the in-\ntroduction of the papers by project members. The CHI\nStudy Group, therefore, serves its role in terms of cover-\ning all the papers. However, understanding the trends in a research field entails comprehensively reading all pa-\npers outside particular domains and holding discussions\nafter reading the papers. We believe that trends can\nonly be properly identified through discussions within\nthe small group that undertook to read all the papers."}, {"heading": "3 Trends at CVPR2015", "text": "This paper is mainly divided into three main areas;\nnamely, (i) Recognition, (ii) 3D, and (iii) Imaging/Image\nprocessing. Before we proceed with discussing the details of each area, we will first explain the features and\nperspectives gleaned from the titles of the papers and\nof the papers selected for oral presentation.\n3.1 CVPR2015, as seen from the titles of the papers\nFigure 1 shows a visualization of the titles of papers\nat CVPR2015 using Wordle [608], a word-visualization\nservice. We see that other than \u201cimage\u201d as the most\nfrequent word, which is expected, we also see that the words \u201cdeep,\u201d \u201clearning,\u201d \u201cobject,\u201d and \u201crecognition\u201d\nare very prominent. As can be seen from this word visu-\nalization and goes without saying, deep learning (DL)\nis a widely used tool in image recognition in researches presented at CVPR2015. Results of a search among\nCVPR2015 papers showed that the term was found\nin 250 out of the 602 papers. Although deep learn-\ning was mainly used for object recognition, since R-\nCNN [609] was proposed, it also came to be used more for object detection. Also, with detection and recog-\nnition becoming more accurate, there are now more\nresearch initiatives to address semantic segmentation,\nwhich is an even more difficult problem. Meanwhile, the paper that received the Best Paper Award dealt with\nthe method called DynamicFusion [38], which pertains\nto real-time construction of high-resolution 3D models.\nThe research was recognized for being able to successfully reconstruct non-rigid models in real time, in ad-\ndition to being able to reconstruct in higher resolution\nthan KinectFusion [610]. As shown by the prominence\nof the words \u201creconstruction,\u201d \u201cdepth,\u201d and \u201cshape,\u201d\n3D research is also progressing at a steady pace. Also, deep learning is also being applied in stereo matching\nand 3D features, indicating the widening applications of\ndeep learning. Even in imaging technologies, deblurring\nand sensing technologies are being updated, wherein examples of applications of feature extraction through\ndeep learning were reported.\n3.2 CVPR2015 as seen from the oral presentations\nThe 12 oral sessions are presented in CVPR2015 as be-\nlow:\n\u2013 CNN Architectures \u2013 Depth and 3D Surfaces\n\u2013 Discovery and Dense Correspondences\n\u2013 3D Shape: Matching, Recognition, Reconstruction\n\u2013 Images and Language\n\u2013 Multiple View Geometry\n\u2013 Segmentation in Images and Video\n\u2013 3D Models and Images\n\u2013 Action and Event Recognition \u2013 Computational Photography\n\u2013 Learning and Matching Local Features\n\u2013 Image and Video Processing and Restoration"}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Recognition", "text": "With CNN as the most widely used approach in deep\nlearning, the theme of the first oral presentation was\non CNN Architecture. First we would like to mention about GoogLeNet [1], the winner of the ILSVRC2014\nwith a record 6.67% top-5 error rate. GoogLeNet is a\n22-layers CNN architecture, where convolutional struc-\ntures are recursively connected to make a deep struc-\nture. Some presentations dealt with addressing the conventional problems in image recognition through deep\nlearning, such as methods to implement multi-layer or\nmulti-instance learning in order to achieve flexibility\nthrough shape change [43], implementing optimization and repetition through Bayesian Optimization in the\nperiphery of highly likely candidate regions in order to\ncorrect errors in object detection using R-CNN [28],\nproposal of a robust expression to withstand positional\ninvariability and deformations [108], etc. Meanwhile, Nguyen et al. automatically generated features that\nare mistakenly recognized by deep learning and showed\nthat CNN features are not universal [47]. In Long et al.s\nsegmentation method (FCN) [372], inputting images results in an output wherein images segmented by pixel\nare outputted as fully connected layers. [168] reports on\nthe use of deep learning for morphing. A corresponding\nmodel of the chair is generated when the type of chair,\ncamera viewpoint, and conversion parameters are inputted. There was also a paper on the output of mul-\ntiple attributes from deep learning for crowded human\nenvironment [504]. It includes 94 attributes, and tags\nexplaining where, what kind of person, what is the person doing, etc. are returned. Also, there was a research\non visualization of features of each layer of CNN [562],\npointing to progress in the understanding of deep learn-\ning. A prominent session in the oral presentations for\nthe area of recognition is Images and Language for image generation captions (image descriptions). In recent\nyears, the level of research in this area has increased due\nto progress in research on recognition performance and\nnatural language processing [339,342,285,296,324,254, 347,161]. The Action and Event Recognition session\nformerly dealt with saliency and extension of human\naction recognition. Shu et al. reported on taking aerial\nvideos using drones (unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV))\nto extract human lines of movement and recognize their\ngroup actions [495]. Fernando et al. proposed Video-\nDarwin as a mechanism for capturing slowly changing\nactions in videos [583]. Ma et al. expressed the hierarchy of each part of action recognition through integration\nof tree structures [544]. Khatoonabadi et al. [596] pre-\nsented a method on saliency and Park et al. presented\na method on social saliency prediction [517]. In [596], they presented a method to achieve saliency and seg-\nmentation while reducing amount of information, based\non image compression methods. Social saliency predic-\ntion [517] infers the area where attention is focused\nbased on gaze directions of multiple persons."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 3D", "text": "With DynamicFusion [38] at the head of the list, new\nmethods on 3D were proposed. DynamicFusion is a method for conducting more precise 3D shape restora-\ntion in real time by chronologically integrating depth\nimages obtained through Kinect and other methods.\nSUN RGB-D [62] was proposed as a large-scale data set that captures indoor space in three-dimension. Their\ndataset contains a total of 10,335 RGB-D images, and\nthey presented several important issues on the topic.\nResearch on occlusion using 3D models has also pro-\ngressed. Xiang et al. [207] used 3D Voxel Patterns (3DVP) to carry out 3D detection and enabled detection of miss-\ning parts of objects where occlusion or defects have\noccurred, using a model-based method. Reconstruct-\ning the World in Six Days is an example of research on large-scale space [356]. They carried out 3D recon-\nstruction through world-scale SfM of 100 million im-\nages of worldwide landmarks found in flickr. Hengel\net al. used silhouette obtained from multiple images\nto carry out meaningful resolution of each part of the 3D model [96]. The 3D structure was realized through\nBlock World [611]. Richter et al. proposed a method for\ndiscriminatively resolving Shape-from-Shading [123]. Albl\net al. came up with a mechanism for properly operating, in global shutters as well as in local shutters, the\nperspective-n-point problem (PnP), which is considered\nimportant in SfM, inferring camera position, and cal-\nculating odometry [249]. Due to the problem of having\nan arbitrary rotation matrix, in their proposed method, they proposed an R6P algorithm to make more dense\ncalculation of rotation matrix. Song et al. proposed\na method to infer the 3D location of vehicles using\nmonocular cameras [404]. Kulkarni et al. proposed Picture (Probabilistic Programming Language), which is a\nstochastic expression of 3D modeling, to enable express-\ning a more complicated generation model [475]. Wang et\nal. conducted 3D scene recognition in outdoor environ-\nment using GPS positional information as preliminary\ndata [429]. CRF was applied to assign segments and\ntheir significance to 3D positional information. Barron\net al. devised an optimized method to enable generation of effective stereo images [483]. Use of Defocus and\nFast Bilateral Filter eliminates the need for calculating\nall corresponding points. Wang et al. devised a method\nfor searching the 3D model from the 2D sketch [204]. A sketch image as seen from multiple perspectives is\ngenerated from the 3D model of one sample, and a 3D\nmodel is searched through comparison with inputted\nsketch image and presented to the user. Brubaker et al.\ncarried out 3D molecular model reconstruction of highresolution image from low-resolution image using elec-\ntron cryomicroscopy [336]. Chin et al. realized improve-\nment of robust matching such as RANSAC through op-\ntimization by A*search [262]."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Image processing/imaging", "text": "In regard to image processing and imaging, advances\nin research through new themes were seen. For exam-\nple, Tanaka et al. presented their research resolution\nof paintings that are physically separated into multiple layers, such as pencil sketches or colored paint-\nings [592], enabling the extraction of even deeper com-\nponents. [554] presented the problem of finding an effi-\ncient border ownership (where the borderline is, whether\nan area is part of the background or foreground) in 2D images. The authors addressed the problem by using\nstructural random forests (SRF) to differentiate bor-\nders. The problem regarding realizing photometric stereo\nunder natural light rather than controlled light sources was also presented [489]. In order to apply photometric\nstereo in outdoor environment, the authors assumed a\nhemispherical experimental space and used GPS times-\ntamp as preliminary information, and separately car-\nried out light source estimation of sunlight. There were several proposals regarding the problem of inferring depth\nimages from input images and videos, as well as a pa-\nper on simultaneous solution for image correction from\nfogged images and for inference of depth images [540]. Research on super-resolution was also included in the\noral presentations [563]. The authors used self-similarity\nbased super-resolution, and at the same time carried\nout inference of affine transformation parameters and localized shape variations.\n3.3 CVPR2015 as seen by area of study\nIn the previous section we looked at CVPR2015 based\non the titles and papers selected for oral presentation.\nIn this section we will enumerate papers in more detail\nby area of study. Here we will comprehend the current\ntrends in the field of computer vision by looking at all\npapers, regardless of whether they were presented orally\nor as posters."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Recognition", "text": "Deep learning architecture. We will cite papers that\ndiscuss the overall structure, as well as those that deal with problem-based structures, parameter adjustments,\nand architecture evaluation. Two examples of papers\nthat discuss overall structure are on GoogLeNet [1] and\nDeepID-Net [261]. DeepID-Net uses Deformation Constrained (Def) pooling as alternative to max pooling\nand average pooling in order to improve expressiveness\nagainst changes in shape and position, as in DPM [616],\ncontributing to improvement of accuracy in object de-\ntection. There were also many examples of attempts to carry out improvements under the framework of ex-\nisting CNN methods [48,405,93]. Wan et al. combined\nthe advantages of DPM and CNN and, further, imple-\nmented Non-maximum Suppression (NMS) in order to correct effects of positional discrepancies [93]. DPM is\na method for preserving parts and position in latent\nvariables, while CNN has the advantage of being able\nto automatically learn features that are useful for ob-\nject recognition. Other papers dealt with the characteristics of CNN [47,43,108], increasing speed of learn-\ning [88], initiatives to search for parameters [580], and\nvisualization of features [562]. Lenc et al. carried out ro-\nbust CNN feature expression to address image rotation by implementing a transformation layer for geometric\ntransformation of convoluted features [108]. Liu et al.\nsucceeded in reducing computational complexity and\nCNN calculation time by implementing sparse repre-\nsentation to address convolution [88]. They succeeded in significantly reducing calculation time by sparsing of\nkernels computed at every convolution, and improved\ncalculation to enable operation even on a CPU. He et al.\nstudied depth of structure, filter size, stride, and other trade-offs pertaining to CCN architectural parameters\n[580], and showed that depth is important. Other pa-\npers dealt with improvement of convolution layers [365],\nmethod to calculate similarity of patches [355,471], and\nresearch on morphing under the CNN framework [168]. Liang et al. claimed that better features can be obtained\nif CNN convolution frameworks are recursively convo-\nluted [365]. This structure is called Recurrent Convolu-\ntional Layter (RCL). In MatchNet, architecture is configured for the purpose of measuring similarity between\npatches, and is partitioned to a network for generating\nfeatures through pooling and convolution of four layers\nand a network for evaluating similarity through total\ncombination of three layers [355]. Zagoruyko et al. also\ndiscussed a framework for calculating patch similarities\nin CNN [471]. They extracted the features based on con-\nvolutions of paired patches and calculated similarity in the later layers.\nHuman recognition. We will introduce papers in Human Recognition by dividing them into Face Recog-\nnitionPedestrian DetectionHuman TrackingPose Esti-\nmationAction RecognitionEvent RecognitionCrowdAnal-\nysisEgocentric Visionand Person Re-identification.\nFirst, in face recognition, FaceNet was presented\nas a system for handling high-precision recognition [89].\nDeepFace, which has been recently proposed in 2014 [619],\nbrought about significant improvements in accuracy, but FaceNet has achieved an even higher accuracy than\nDeepFace. Sun et al. improved their conventional face\nrecognition, DeepNet [623], and applied features ex-\ntracted from early convolution layers to improve face recognition accuracy particularly of face profiles and\nocclusions [314].\nIn pedestrian detection, Tian et al. were able to improve accuracy by combining CNN features and\nattributes for detection of pedestrians [550]. They ac-\ncomplished this by including other attributes, such as\npositional relationships between pedestrians and envi-\nronment, as well as learning of pedestrians and backgrounds. Honsang et al. implemented evaluation of fea-\ntures using CNN to carry out pedestrian detection [441].\nIn pose estimation, a research on marker-less mo-\ntion capture using CNN features was presented [412].\nFor practical use, it is possible to significantly reduce in-\nstallation costs if estimation can be implemented through\nmaker-less MoCap using 23 cameras.\nIn human tracking, there were reports featuring\nmore advanced methods. Milan et al. were able to simul-\ntaneously carry out tasks of chronological area estimation and positioning by using Superfixel and CRF [585].\nThey established a method for combining low- and high-\nlevel information and finely dividing background and\nforeground. A method for carrying out accurate tracking of multiple objects using Target Identity-aware Net-\nwork Flow (TINF), which probabilistically resolves net-\nwork nodes, was also presented [125]. The method con-\nstructs the optimum network using graph theory and\ncarries out optimization through Lagrangian relaxation optimization. In action recognition, Gkioxari et al. used\nR-CNN [609] as basis for proposing a mechanism for\nrecognizing actions, including position of the human\nsubjects [83]. In order to extract the action area, candidate areas where extracted from an assembly of optical\nflows to extract CNN-based features. And in order to\nextract features from chronological actions, convolution\nwas implemented for chronological images that stored\noptical flows and RGB visible images. To improve ac-\ncuracy, researchers proposed a method based on Dense\nTrajectories (DT) [620,621] and on TDD, an action de-\nscriptor that combines CNN features [583]. In regard to the DT-based method, researchers adopted HOG,\nHOF, and MBH to accurately recognize actions, as well\nas applied CNN features to action recognition through\nnormalization of the feature map. Lan et al. proposed Multi-skip Feature Stacking (MIFS), a method for ex-\ntract features by configuring multiple gradations to a\nchronological offset [23].\nIn event recognition, architecture specialized for\nevent recognition called Deep Event Network (DevNet) was proposed [279]. The system enabled extracting not\nonly pre-defined events, but also clues for important\nchronological events. Xiong et al. carried out recogni-\ntion of complex events by combining multiple identification results and factors for still images and combined\nCNN features and results of object/human/face detec-\ntion results to recognize events [175]. Shu et al. carried\nout event recognition from aerial images taken using\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) [495]. They proposed a Space-time AND-OR Graph to analyze various clues\nfrom images from drones, such as positional adjustment\nof images containing egomotion, group action recogni-\ntion, and human interaction.\nIn crowd analysis, a mechanism that allows cross-\nscene crowd counting was proposed [91]. They used a\nCNN model that allows switching the crowd density\nmap and human count model. Although these two mod-\nels are different, they are correlated and complement each others accuracy. Yi et al. analyzed crowd models\nfrom videos taken from surveillance cameras and mea-\nsured routine pedestrian path directions [378]. They\npredicted crowd attributes and pedestrian destinations and enabled detection of abnormal actions as well as\nprediction of paths taken to reach destinations.\nA method for editing ones own videos taken using\negocentric vision was also proposed [590]. Research\nto solve face recognition problems, such as recognition of severely occluded faces and small and far faces in\nimages, has progressed. Huang et al. proposed a hand\nregion segmentation method for egocentric vision to de-\ntermine what tasks the person taking the video is per-\nforming [73].\nPerson re-identification deals with the problem\nof personal authentication between different cameras\nfor surveillance and other cameras. Shi et al. inferred se-\nmantic attributes regarding humans and clothing at the patch level, and applied them in person re-identification [453].\nThey obtained clothing and other external appearance\nfeatures and were able to improve expressivity by us-\ning attributes. Chen et al. carried Multiple Similar-\nity Function Learning using PCA compression color\nand texture features from images with segregated re-\ngions [171]. Zheng et al. evaluated effectiveness of fea-\ntures and enabled feature integration needed for Re-ID using Late Fusion [190]. Person re-identification using\nlow-resolution images was also addressed [76]. Gener-\nally, images from surveillance cameras are of poor qual-\nity, and to address this, Jing et al. carried out superresolution to propose a mechanism for improving per-\nformance even for low-resolution images. Neural net-\nwork architecture to improve robustness against feature\nvariations between cameras was also proposed [423].\nGiven a pair of images as input, the authors used the difference of activation functions extracted from each\npatch after convolution and pooling as features for recog-\nnition.\nObject recognition and detection. The problem of recognizing objects appearing in images is currently\nan intensively studied area. This section also deals with\nobject detection that includes recognition of position,\nscene recognition, search of hashed images, as well as\nfine-grained image recognition. Papers on object recognition have dramatically increased after AlexNet was\nproposed [614] at ILSVRC2012, and object recognition\nhas also been applied to scene recognition and other\nproblems. Research on object detection expanded after the proposal of R-CNN [609]. These trends are clearly\nevident in CVPR2015.\nA study was conducted to improve accuracy and\nstreamline recognition by carrying out selection of CNN\nfactors [106]. Association Rules [626] widely used in the data mining field were applied, and only features that\nare useful for identification were selected as a subset\nfrom among the CNN feature space. In object detection,\nthere were many researches addressing the problem of\ninaccurate localization, which is one of the vulnerabilities of R-CNN. As previously mentioned, Zhang et al.\nproposed a method for optimization to correct inaccu-\nrate localization in R-CNN to address this vulnerabil-\nity [28]. Tsai et al. considered the diversity of internal changes and variations of objects for detection, and\ncompensated for inaccurate localization by improving\nfeature pooling [80]. Oquab et al. used weakly super-\nvised learning to investigate solutions for discrimina-\ntion and localization of objects based only on labeling of image levels [75]. Fine-grained image discrimination\nis a problem that entails more detailed classification of\nobjects, such as dog breeds or vehicle types. Due to high\nvisual similarity of objects, such detailed classification is very difficult to carry out. It was found that adap-\ntively extracting features useful for discrimination by\ndividing images into parts and extracting features only\nfrom particular regions is an effective method [630].\nUsing CNN architecture, Xiao et al. extracted candi-\ndate patches from major categories (e.g. dog, bird) and\ndetailed categories (e.g. fine classification of dogs and\nbirds) in a layered structure, and simultaneously implemented feature selection and discrimination [92]. Xie et\nal. carried out learning by applying multitask learn-\ning in multiple structured classes as well as in limited\ntask data extensions [287]. They succeeded in simultaneously learning relationships through multitask learn-\ning of major and minor classifications. Lin et al. [182]\nproposed Deep Localization, Alignment and Classifica-\ntion (DeepLAC) as a mechanism to correct changes in\nregional position and angles, which is needed for finegrained image recognition, within the back-propagation\nalgorithm framework.\nSegmentation. Segmentation requires implement-\ning object recognition at the pixel level, making it a difficult procedure in terms of distinguishing borders\nbetween foreground and background. The number of\npapers dealing with semantic segmentation, which deals\nwith assignment of meaning to segmentation areas, has\nincreased.\nHariharan et al. demonstrated the increase in accu-\nracy of semantic segregation by using features extracted\nin the middle layers, not only from the fully connected\nlayer, in regard to CNN architecture [49]. In particular, they used the 2nd pooling layer, the 4th convolu-\ntion layer, and the 7th fully connected layer, and by\ncombining these they were able to simultaneously im-\nplement low-, mid-, and high-level feature expression.\nIn saliency-based segmentation, a method was proposed for extracting multi-scale CNN features [591]. Itti et al.s\nsaliency model is well known [627], and, although they\nconducted multi-scale calculations, Li et al. extracted\nsaliency and applied it segmentation by replacing CNN features. Although it overlaps with 3D reconstruction,\nwe would like to mention here that Martinovic et al.\nproposed research for implementing semantic segmen-\ntation of 3D urban models [482].\nData generation. Data generation is an important issue in addressing recognition problems. In this sec-\ntion we will cite papers on data collection and selection.\nHattori et al. generated learning images for pedestrian\ndetection [413]. They conducted learning of 36 types\nof pedestrians, various kinds of walking, and occlusion patterns using CG. Russakovsky et al. cited an annota-\ntion method leveraging crowdsourcing, in order to effi-\nciently and accurately detect objects [231]. The method\ndeals with the usability and accuracy of labeling and is aimed at minimizing human annotation costs, wherein\nmachines and humans interactively carry out annota-\ntion based on results from baseline recognition equip-\nment. Xiao et al. discussed a framework for efficient\nlabeling and learning, in an effort to reduce annotation\noperations for massive data [292]."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 3-Dimension", "text": "There were also many examples of applications of CNN\neven for 3D object recognition. Fang et al. proposed\nDeep Shape Descriptor (DeepSD) as a method for expressing 3D shapes [252]. They proposed a robust 3D\nfeature that can handle structural variations in shape,\nnoise, and shapes that include three-dimensional incom-\npleteness. Xie et al. proposed DeepShape, a CNN fea-\nture to address problems in 3D object matching and retrieval [139]. They used a shape descriptor based on\nan auto-encoder to search 3D shapes. Abdelrahman et\nal. proposed a 3D non-rigid texture descriptor based on\nWeighted Heat Kernel Signature (W-HKS) [21]. There was also a proposal for a mechanism to extract informa-\ntion useful for recognition even from a limited learning\nsample using Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) and de-\nsign of object recognition features through RGB-D [327].\nThey proposed an effective descriptor even for complex 3D objects by combining geometric shape information\nas well as color information.\nIn RGB-D input, a problem was reported in giv-\ning tasks, such as 3D recognition and inferring posi-\ntions that can be grasped by robots, in complex indoor environment [498]. Superfixel was applied as a prelim-\ninary processing step, and recognition of cuboid mod-\nels and spatial smoothing through Conditional Random\nFields (CRF) was carried out. Matsuo et al. also proposed a method for enhancing depth images (partic-\nularly planes) by combining low-resolution depth im-\nages and high-resolution RGB images [387]. They ad-\njusted position and connection of tangent planes in 3D\nspace and used JBU filter to reconstruct rough surfaces. Gupta et al. conducted research on extracting object\nposition and 3D segmentation results from RGB-D im-\nage input [512]. They expressed object features through\nlearning by CNN of surface normal line images. They then roughly estimated object pose based on 3-layered\nCNN and inferred detailed object pose and segment by\ncomparison with the 3D model."}, {"heading": "3.3.3 Image processing/imaging", "text": "CNN was also used for blur removal [84]. Non-uniform\nmotion blurs arising from shaking of camera, etc. were\ncorrected through learning of blurred/non-blurred patch pairs. There was also a research on fusion of multiple\nkernels [41]. The authors adopted a method using ker-\nnels for fusing multiple deblurring methods in order to\ndevelop a more advanced blur removal method. By us-\ning Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRF), they\nwere able to carry out kernel fusion based on learning.\nEriksson et al. proposed a method for noise removal\nthat takes sparsity into consideration [363]. To solve the k-support norm optimization and normalization prob-\nlem, Eriksson et al. carried optimization by considering\nthis problem as the minimum convex set that includes\nthe set given as Convex Envelopes. Research on blur removal for videos was also reported [437]. There are two\nmethods for blur removal for videos. One is by indepen-\ndently removing blur within the frames and splicing the\nframes together. The other is by inferring camera mo-\ntion between frames. Zhang et al. combined these two methods.\nIn regard to the problem of super-resolution, a method\nusing Self-Similarity based Super-Resolution was re-\nported [563]. The method simultaneously infers affine transformations and localized shape variations. Com-\nparison with external/internal dictionaries enabled map-\nping to clear images. A method using a reference dic-\ntionary that accommodates shape variations was also\nreported to address the super-resolution problem for single images [587]. Gradient Ridge Image processing\nwas performed as a preliminary processing step, and\nresolution was enhanced through matching with the\ndictionary. Schulter et al. solved the single-image superresolution problem as a linear regression problem using\nRandom Forests [410].\nA method for inferring shadow regions using CNN\nwas reported for basic algorithms in image process-\ning [225]. Shen et al. also proposed DeepContour, which is a CNN architecture for contour detection [431]. Deep-\nContour involves learning contour/non-contour regions\nand is composed of a 6-layered architecture (four convo-\nlution layers and two fully connected layers). DeepEdge was also proposed as an application of CNN architec-\nture for edge detection [474]. DeepEdge carries out more\naccurate edge detection by using higher-level features.\nExperimentally, they were able to show that unlike Can-\nnyEdge, where there was noise contamination, DeepEdge was able to better remove backgrounds as well as ex-\ntract edges from objects. Teo et al. also proposed a\nmethod for effectively extracting borderlines in 2D im-\nages [554]. By using Structural Random Forests (SRF), they were able to rapidly determine where the borders\nare, and whether the area belongs to the background or\nthe foreground. A research on the application of Linear\nSpectral Clustering (LSC) to Superpixel methods was\nalso presented [148].\nIn device research, a hyperspectral camera that\ncan acquire chronological images was proposed [535].\nSequences of multiple hyperspectral cameras were alter-\nnately complemented, and image reconstruction based\non dictionary learning was conducted, in order to obtain\nclear images even at high-speed (100 fps) observation.\nTi et al. developed a ToF sensor using a monocular\ncamera and LED [469]. They developed the ToF sensor by attaching a total of four LEDs to the upper,\nlower, right, and left sides of the camera and capturing\nthe reflection of LED light using the camera. To im-\nprove accuracy of ToF cameras, Naik et al. resolved the problem of Multipath Interference (MPI), where multi-\nple optical reflections appear and are mixed up in the\npixel [9]. MPI also occurs in natural scenes, such as in\nan environment where multiple reflected lights occur or\nreflected light is diffused. These reflections were divided into Phase and Amplitude, both directly and globally,\nin order to reduce depth image errors due to MPI. Ye\net al. proposed an enhanced Kinect sensor by attaching\nUltrasonic Sensor to Kinect [529]. They inferred the plane by applying Bayesian Network to the inference\npoint obtained through the Ultrasonic Sensor."}, {"heading": "3.3.4 Datasets", "text": "In this section, we will discuss new research problems as well as research on datasets.\nDatasets. An example of a dataset is the SUN\nRGB-D, an expansion of SUNdatabase (which is a prob-\nlem in scene recognition mentioned in the previous section) to RGB-D [62]. It is an attempt to expand the\ndata set into more advanced scene recognition, such as\nsegmentation and detection of objects within scenes,\nother than merely for recognition. A similar research\nproblem is on the dataset for estimating indoor layout proposed by Liu et al [370]. The dataset for indoor envi-\nronment included information on the entire room, walls,\ndoors, windows, and their positional information. A re-\nsearch for outputting detailed explanations of medical images was also reported [119]. This research problem\npertained to outputting sentence descriptions from an\ninput of medical images. Detailed explanations of symp-\ntoms are generated by learning in pairs the actual med-\nical images and the corresponding medical examination results. There was also an attempt to increase recogni-\ntion capability by creating a much larger-scale dataset\nin the field of fine-grained recognition [65]. NABirds\nis a dataset for fine-grained recognition of birds, the scope of which was expanded by increasing the num-\nber of classes. There was also a report on a dataset\nfor categorizing cars [430]. The study provided data for\nfine-grained classification of cars, which previously were\nonly categorized into the class called cars.\nThere was also a study on creating data for detec-\ntion of pedestrians through the use of images contain-\ning a higher amount of information. Hwang et al. used\na hyperspectral camera to acquire richer image infor-\nmation in order to improve detection of pedestrians at\nnighttime as well as daytime [113]. A dataset was also\nproposed for analyzing each person in a crowd by focusing on the spectators rather than on the sport it-\nself [222]. They analyzed individual reactions of per-\nsons in a crowd, categorized crowds, and determined\nthe type of spectators. In regard to pedestrian detection, a dataset was proposed for estimating gender, age,\nweight, clothing, etc., of pedestrians as well their lo-\ncation [594]. This dataset is intended for fine-grained\nrecognition of persons. Thus, there was more focus on\naddressing fine-grained detection of pedestrians. There is more research being conducted on generation of im-\nage descriptions, with one oral session devoted to the\ntopic. In particular, Rohrbach et al. proposed a dataset\nfor movie description [347]. For action recognition datasets, Heilbron et al. published a dataset called ActivityNet [105],\nwhich is a large-scale dataset similar to ImageNet and\nincludes a significantly greater amount of data and ac-\ntion variations. The dataset includes 203 trimmed data\nclasses and 137 untrimmed classes, for a total of 849 video hours. Also in action recognition, Xu et al. pro-\nposed a dataset that maps attributes in advance to ac-\ntors and actions [246].\nNew research problems. Here we introduce new\nresearch problems proposed at CVPR2015. Lin et al. proposed the research problem of identifying locations\nof aerial images using images taken on the streets as\nquery [542]. Although ground images and aerial im-\nages are completely different in nature, the authors presented a possible approach to the problem by proposing\nWhere-CNN. Akhter et al. conducted estimation of 3D\nhuman pose from 2D joint angles, and by adding a joint\nangle limit they were able to add a process for reducing\nposes with inscrutable motion [158]. Peng et al. proposed two new aspects on human emotions predicted\nfrom images [94]. There was a paper on detecting per-\nsons or animals in a best relationship, i.e., with a high\nco-occurrence relationship with another person or animal based on Best-Buddies Similarity [220]. The au-\nthors proposed a method based on template matching\nto visualize the co-occurrence relationship. There was\nalso a paper that addressed the problem of identifying\nvery important people (VIP) within a group [526]. The authors used im2text to solve the problem by classifying\nlevel of importance of images and texts. Traditional ma-\nchine learning methods map input and output vectors\nas pairs, but Wang et al. assigned hidden information to images to further improve flexibility [538]. On the basis\nof this concept, they proposed that hidden information\nbe handled as features or second objective functions.\nZhang et al. proposed a method to address the problem of counting items in an image as well as finding saliency\nfrom images [438]. They claimed that it can be used\nfor egocentric lifelogs and image thumbnails. Not only\nin sensing, but there will also be a need to carry out person recognition in next-generation camera images\nwhose resolution has been lowered for security and pri-\nvacy protection. This problem is addressed by Pittaluga\net al. by carrying out face and pose recognition that\ncan handle low-resolution images and resist changes in light source, proposing the method to be used for pri-\nvacy protection [35]. There was also a proposal on ob-\nject recognition that takes into consideration what kind\nof tasks are completed using particular tools [310]. The authors constructed 3D models of objects using 3D sen-\nsors and inferred the position by which the person car-\nries the object based on joint angle, and measured how\nthe task is being carried out. Measurement was made\nnot only on 2D and 3D images, but they also calculated the impulse strength using voice data. Handling of the\ntool was inferred based on joint angle trajectory. There\nwas also a proposal for inferring what a store is selling\nbased on the storefront image [185]. Streetview images were used to extract characters through OCR, and on-\ntology from those characters was used to classify stores\naccording to business category."}, {"heading": "4 DeepSurvey", "text": "We are proposing DeepSurvey (see Figure 2) as a mech-\nanism for the systematization of knowledge, the gener-\nation of ideas, and as well as the writing of papers (spe-\ncially for new research problems) based on an extensive reading of papers. DeepSurvey architecture is devised\nbased on DeepLearning, which has flourished in recent\nyears, and is composed of the following elements:\n\u2013 Input: Input the papers read (knowledge)\n\u2013 1st ideas: Individually generate ideas (from knowl-\nedge to ideas)\n\u2013 1st discussion: Group discussion (consolidation of ideas)\n\u2013 2nd ideas: Generate more ideas based on consoli-\ndated ideas\n\u2013 2nd discussion: Further refinement of ideas\n\u2013 1st implementation: Pick-up and hackathon\n\u2013 2nd implementation: Full-scale implementation and\nexperiment\n\u2013 Output: Paper\nIn comparison with general Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNN) [631], ideas can be replaced with con-\nvolution layer, discussion with pooling, and implementation with fully connected layer to make it easier to\nunderstand. In pooling (discussion), multiple ideas are\ncollected and good ideas are inputted as they are to\nthe next layer, thus, it is closely similar to Lp pooling, which simultaneously possesses characteristics of max\npooling and average pooling. The strategy is to repeat\ngeneration of ideas and discussion, and proceed to im-\nplementation once ideas have taken shape. The current\ncounting of layers include convolutional layers and fully connected layers, thus, the architecture is a four-layer\nconfiguration.\nThe most important feature of this architecture is\nthe method for \u201cbecoming a part of the neuron.\u201d Under this framework, since the entire group works as one\nneural network architecture in real, rather than in vir-\ntual space, the group is able to write papers as the final\noutput. (Thankfully, we got first output of DeepSurvey [634] which includes a conceptual subject integrat-\ning semantic segmentation into change detection.) It is\nalso characterized by project members actually doing\nthe thinking, reading, and writing of papers to enable\nthem to grow, wherein the network itself grows and matures.\nFor 2015, there was little time left for implementa-\ntion and writing of papers, but we would like to write a more refined paper in the next year as well as be able\nto propose new research problems. Recently, since the\nstructure of the architecture is also becoming deeper\n(VGGNet [632]: 16/19 layers; ResNet [633] 50/101/152\nlayers), going forward, we would like to generate more ideas, hold more discussions, and produce more refined\nideas, research problems, and papers."}, {"heading": "5 Summary and future trends", "text": "In this survey we comprehensively read papers pre-\nsented at CVPR2015 to gain an understanding of the trends in computer vision.
