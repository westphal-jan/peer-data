ELM is efficient due to its application of the analytical approach to calculating the weights between the hidden and output layers. However, ELM still does not output the semantic classification results. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a diversified top-k shapelets transformation framework in which the shapelets are the subsequences, i.e. the best representative and interpretive characteristics of each class. As we have found, the biggest challenge is how to extract the best k shapelets in original candidate sets and how to automatically determine the k value. Specifically, we first define the similar shapelets and diversified top k shapelets in order to construct diversification forms. Subsequently, a novel diversification based top shape graph based on the ELF shape algorithm is proposed.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 00:59:11 GMT  (255kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05934v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["qiuyan yan", "qifa sun", "xinming yan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05934"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.05934.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Adapting ELM to Time Series Classification: A Novel Diversified Top-k Shapelets Extraction Method", "authors": ["Qiuyan Yan", "Qifa Sun", "Xinming Yan"], "emails": ["yanqy@cumt.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Extreme Learning Machine (ELM for short) was originally developed based on single hidden-layer feed forward neural networks (SLFNs) [1]. Compared with the conventional learning machines, it is of extremely fast learning capacity and good generalization capability. Thus, ELM, with its variants [2,3], has been widely applied in many fields [4,5]. The results indicate that ELM produces comparable or better classification accuracies with reduced training time and implementation complexity compared to artificial neural networks methods and support vector machine methods.\nUnfortunately, as a black-box method, ELM fails to measure up to the task of time series data classification by itself. A possible solution to this issue is\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n05 93\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n0 Ju\nto improve the interpretability of ELM by feature selection. If a set of selected features improve the classification accuracy much more than original feature sets, it is reasonable to interpret the results by them. Nevertheless, selection the most representative and interpretative feature can improve the interpretability of ELM and make ELM more adapt to time series classification. In the context of feature selection in time series data analysis, most of the current methods adopt such a framework that ranks subsequences according to their individual discriminative power to the target class and then selects top-k ranked subsequences[6]. These methods have some common drawbacks: (1) the selected features are not the most representative and interpretative, (2) many redundant features are selected, and (3) the number of selected feature is arbitrarily specified by a parameter k .\nIn this paper, a novel method is proposed to improve ELM representative and interpretative ability by extraction diversified top-k shapelets features.Shapelets was introduced as a primitive for time series data mining [7] and was utilized in classifying time series data [8,9]. The original shapelet based classifier embeds the shapelet discovery algorithm in a decision tree, and uses information gain to assess the quality of candidates. Shapelets transformed classification methods [10,11] were proposed to separate the processing of shapelets selection and classification. The k shapelets are selected in an offline manner, and which can not only improve the affectivity and efficiency of classification, but also introduce a common feature attraction method which can be used in all typical time series classification algorithms. Nevertheless, shapelets based classification methods have been widely discussed and used in many real applications [12,13,14].\nThe most challenge is that there are large quantities of redundant shapelets in candidates which decreasing the accuracy of classification and the parameter k is hard to determine. Some works [11,15] detect this problem and use clustering or pruning methods to remove the redundant,but still exist redundant shapelets, also, the k value is determined from experiments. This paper make the following contributions: First, in order to get rid of the similar and redundant shapelets in candidate set, two conceptions including similar shapelets and diversified top-k shapelets are presented. Based on these conceptions, a method of construction diversify shapelets graph is proposed. Second, a diversified top-k shapelets query method is presented to find top-k representative shapeletes of each class. Third, we propose an diversified top-k shapelets transformed ELM algorithm which can automatically determine the parameter k and transform data using the determined k shapelets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the interpretability and performance of ELM."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminary", "text": "Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a generalized single hidden-layer feedforward network.

Learning Machine) is a single hidden layer feed-forward network, where the weights between input and hidden layer are initialized randomly. ELM is efficient due to its utilization of the analytical approach to compute weights between hidden and output layer. However, ELM still fails to output the semantic classification outcome. To address such limitation, in this paper, we propose a diversified top-k shapelets transform framework, where the shapelets are the subsequences i.e., the best representative and interpretative features of each class. As we identified, the most challenge problems are how to extract the best k shapelets in original candidate sets and how to automatically determine the k value. Specifically, we first define the similar shapelets and diversified top-k shapelets to construct diversity shapelets graph. Then, a novel diversity graph based top-k shapelets extraction algorithm named as DivTopkshapelets is proposed to search top-k diversified shapelets. Finally, we propose a shapelets transformed ELM algorithm named as DivShapELM to automatically determine the k value, which is further utilized for time series classification. The experimental results over public data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional ELM algorithm in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
