Introduction", "text": "Globalization of trade in the health service has given a new form in tourism sector, namely Medical tourism. High cost of treatment, long waiting time, affordability of airfares to overseas destinations and favorable exchange rate change contributed to the fast growth of Medical Tourism (Connell, 2006). In the past decade, the global healthcare market, with a turnover of $40 billion, has grown at a rate of 20 percent in the SouthEast Asian countries with more than 5 million \u2018cross border patients\u2019 accessing health care services (Connell, 2013). Rapid development of medical infrastructure with international standards and certification, easy availability of skilled manpower bring South Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and India at the forefront in this area. Medical Tourism is one of emerging tourism development projects of Indian government to meet the slow decline in the Traditional Tourism sector. With current annual growth of 13.0 percent, the Indian health care sector contributes about $ 23 billion (nearly 4 percent of GDP) to the Indian economy, with \u2018foreign exchange earning around $1.8 billion\u2019 (Chakraborty, 2006). Although research studies are abundant focusing on social impacts of medical tourism, there is no proper\nmethodology for foreign and domestic patients to assess the medical tourist destination of any country. The problem can be solved by taking the interest of stakeholder\u2019s namely medical infrastructure, logistics service providers, government policy along with city demography, in assessing the weights of a multiple criteria set,. Therefore, assessment of desirable medical destination selection and evaluation problem can be considered as a MCDM problem which concerns multiple attributes ranging from customer needs to the resource constraints of the enterprise. In this regard, MADM has become a very crucial area of management research and decision theory with lots of methods developed, extended and modified in solving problems in the present and past few decades. Some of them are, MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison) (Pamucar and Cirovic, 2015), TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)(Hwang and Yoon, 1981), AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process)(Saaty, 1977, 1990), ANP (Analytic Network Process) (Saaty, 1996), DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) (Gabus and Fontela, 1972), PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization METHods for Enrichment Evaluations) (Brans et al.1984, 1985), ELECTRE (ELiminationEt Choice Translating REality) (Roy, 1968), DRSA (Dominance based Rough Set Approach) (Greco et al. 2001), VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija KOmpromisno Resenje) (Opricovic, 1998), DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) (Charnes et al. 1978). Each of them has some advantages and disadvantages, yet they provide satisfactory optimal (compromised) solutions to the given problem. Earlier researchers dealt with precise and certain information based MADM methods. Khoo et al. (1999) pointed out that decision support is based on human knowledge about a specific part of a real or abstract world problem. The data and information in decision making are usually imprecise based on expert\u2019s subjective judgment where a group of experts is invited to implement the final performance evaluation, ranging from individual judgments to aggregate and rank the alternatives. Many concepts, techniques and algorithms are established to analyse imprecise data and human subjective judgement. Some of them are fuzzy sets theory (Zadeh, 1965), Dempster\u2013Shafer theory of evidence (Shafer, 1976), grey theory (Julong, 1989), rough set theory (Pawlak, 1982). The intention of the fuzzy valued evaluation technique is to transform crisp numbers into fuzzy ones with the aid of membership function to deal with the vagueness in decision-making. However, the selection of membership function in fuzzy sets is mainly depending on subjective judgment. In addition, the boundary of fuzzy set is difficult to determine accurately. Almost all concepts which we are using in natural language are vague. Perhaps some people think that they are subjective probability or fuzzy. However, a lot of investigations have been shown that those imprecise quantities behave neither like randomness nor like fuzziness. In modern times, scholars are often faced with complex decision making problems concerning uncertainty stated by interval data, roughness or their hybrid with fuzziness and randomness (Eshghi, 2008). Since human decisions are uncertain and vague, decision\nmakers give their preferences in linguistic terms instead of deterministic value. Rough set theoretic approach is one of the best choices to solve such uncertain MCDM problem. The concept of rough number derived from the basic notion of approximations in rough set theory. A rough number is applied here to aggregate individual judgments and priorities, and vagueness in group decision making due to limited data. Rough set theory proposed by Pawlak (1982), for managing vagueness and uncertainty, is an excellent mathematical tool for the analysis of a vague description of objects in decision problems. Greco et al. (2001) pointed out that the \u2018Pawlak rough set idea\u2019 fails when preference orders of attribute domains (criteria) are to be taken into account. Precisely, it cannot handle inconsistencies following violation of the dominance principle. This inconsistency is characteristic for preferential information used in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA/MADA) problems, like sorting, choice or ranking. In order to deal with this kind of inconsistency, number of methodological changes to the original rough sets theory is necessary. So, Greco et al (2001) introduced DRSA (Dominance based Rough Set Approach) to overcome the barriers but it also has some disadvantages since dominance relation is very weak relation which leaves many objects (alternatives) uncompared. Zhai et al. (2008) defined \u2018rough numbers and rough boundary interval\u2019 through the use of upper and lower approximations which is extended form of basic rough set theory. Zhu et al. (2015) argued that the traditional fuzzy and interval based approaches cannot tackle the subjectivity in decision-making effectively. Most of the methods need to introduce much auxiliary information, such as predetermination of the membership function and the interval boundary, which are subjective as well. To resolve the dilemma, rough number is introduced to manipulate the subjectivity and vagueness in decision-making. Thus it can avoid the subjectivity at the most extent and measure the vagueness in various group decision making areas. Not only can it be used in the determination of criteria weights, but also can it be adopted in the alternative ranking. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work on MABAC which uses rough numbers and integrated with rough AHP in literature. With these considerations this paper extends the MABAC method for rough numbers and hybridized with rough number based Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in multiple criteria decision making (MCDM), when the degree of imprecision is not pre-assumed as in fuzzy theory or probability theory. The proposed hybrid AHP-MABAC method produces all results just from a given data set and no auxiliary information is needed. In this paper, a hybrid AHP-MABAC method dealing with rough numbers is developed to assist decision makers for evaluation and assessment of the optimal alternative(s) for an MCDM problem. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic concepts on the rough numbers, AHP and MABAC methods. Section 3 presents the proposed hybrid AHP-MABAC method based on rough numbers. The implementation of the proposed hybrid method for evaluating the medical tourism sites in India is provided in section 4. Comparative analysis and validity testing of the proposed method is done in section 5. Finally, section 6 concludes the paper."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "2.1 Rough sets and rough numbers\nInspired by rough set theory, rough number is first proposed by Zhai et al. (2008) with the purpose of handling subjective judgments of decision makers and then determining the boundary intervals. The rough number is based on basic notions of rough sets and integrated with interval arithmetic operations to analyse vague information (Zhai et al., 2009). A rough number, containing lower limit, upper limit and the rough boundary interval, depends only on given data and does not require any auxiliary information to capture the experts\u2019 real perception and to improve the objectivity of the decision-making. A class with a smaller rough boundary interval is less vague helping to suppress the enlargement of rough boundary intervals.\nLet U be the universe of all the objects, Y is an arbitrary object of U and R is a set of t classes\u2019 i.e. R = {\ud835\udca21, \ud835\udca22, . . . , \ud835\udca2t}, that covers all objects in U.

It provides the ability to measure consistency of preferences, manipulate multiple decision makers, handle tangible and non-tangible criteria, and manage decision-making involving subjective judgments. Due to the subjectivity and vagueness in decision-making, this paper introduces rough number to combine with AHP to aggregate individual judgments and compute relative importance of each criterion. The procedure of the rough AHP is described as given in Zhu et al. (2015).\nStep 1: Identify the evaluation objective, criteria and alternatives. Construct a hierarchical structure with the evaluation objective at the top layer, criteria at the middle and alternatives at the bottom.\nStep 2: Conduct AHP survey and construct a group of pair-wise comparison matrices. The pair-wise comparison matrix of the \ud835\udc52-th expert is described as:\n\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52 = [\n\ud835\udc4f11 \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc4f12 \ud835\udc52 \u2026 \ud835\udc4f1\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc4f21 \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc4f22 \ud835\udc52 \u2026 \ud835\udc4f2\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc52\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b1 \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b2 \ud835\udc52 \u2026 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc52\n] \ud835\udc64\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc52 = 0, 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 \u2264 \ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc52 \u2264 \ud835\udc58 (13)\nThus, \ud835\udc351, \ud835\udc352, \u2026 , \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc58 are the matrices provided by \ud835\udc58 experts and the effects of the criteria on each other are expressed in terms of linguistic expressions. Calculate the maximum eigenvalue \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc52 of \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52, then compute the consistency index: \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c = \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc52 \u22121\n\ud835\udc5b\u22121 (14)\nDetermine the random consistency index (\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3c) in \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52 1 according to \ud835\udc5b and then compute the consistency ratio \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc45 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3c . Finally, conduct the consistency test. If \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc45 < 0.1, the comparison matrix is acceptable.\nOtherwise, experts\u2019 judgments should be adjusted until \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc45 < 0.1.\nStep 3. By aggregating the expert opinions, the integrated comparison matrix \ud835\udc35 is constructed as\n\ud835\udc35 = [ \ud835\udc4f11 1 , \ud835\udc4f11 2 , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4f11 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4f12 1 , \ud835\udc4f12 2 , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4f12 \ud835\udc58 \u2026 \ud835\udc4f1\ud835\udc5b 1 , \ud835\udc4f1\ud835\udc5b 2 , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4f1\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4f21 1 , \ud835\udc4f21 2 , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4f21 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4f22 1 , \ud835\udc4f22 2 , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4f22 \ud835\udc58 \u2026 \ud835\udc4f2\ud835\udc5b 1 , \ud835\udc4f2\ud835\udc5b 2 , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4f2\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc58 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b1 1 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b1 2 , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b1 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b2 1 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b2 2 , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b2 \ud835\udc58 \u2026 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b 1 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b 2 , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc58 ]\n(15)\n\ud835\udc64\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 = {\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 1 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 2 , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc58 } is the sequence of relative importance of criterion \ud835\udc56 on criterion \ud835\udc57.\nTranslate the element \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc52 into rough number \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc41(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc52 ) using eqn.

Computation of the rough weights of the criteria is done using equations (20)-(21). Finally we normalize those weights according to the equations (22) to get normalized rough number valued weights (Table 5)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Decision making using Rough MABAC", "text": "Rough MABAC is adopted to determine the final ranking of the MT (Medical Tourism) sites once we get the relative weights of the criteria set. Each expert gives a subjective and comprehensive judgment/evaluation for each alternative sites based on qualitative criteria under consideration. All the experts are supposed to use the same 9 point scale of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 which represents \u2018very low\u2019, \u2018low\u2019, \u2018medium\u2019, \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018very high\u2019, respectively. Then the performance of a MT site can be represented by a set of such values from experts\u2019 estimation. Table 6 shows the experts\u2019 evaluation values for MT sites.\nStep 1. The original group decision data in Table 6 are translated into initial rough decision matrix \ud835\udc4b = (\u2308\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc3f , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc48\u230b) 9\u00d77 (Table 7) using equations (1) \u2013 (12).\nStep 2. Depending on the type of the criteria (cost type or minimizing and benefit type or maximizing) we first find the values of \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57 + and \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57 \u2212 according to equations (26) and (27). Next, all the entries of initial rough decision matrix (Table 6) are normalized using equations (24) and (25). Thus, the normalized rough group decision matrix \ud835\udc41 = (\u2308\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc3f , \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc48\u230b) 9\u00d77 is computed (Table 8).\nStep 3. Calculate the weighted rough group decision matrix (Table 9) by multiplying the corresponding normalized weights (table 4) with elements of the normalized rough group decision matrix (Table 8), using equations (28).\nStep 4. Using the geometric aggregation operation for interval valued numbers, the border approximation area (BAA) matrix (Table 10) for each evaluation criterion is computed according to equations (29). For example,\n\ud835\udc541 \ud835\udc3f = (1.246 \u2217 1.387 \u2217 1.072 \u2217 1.072 \u2217 0.882 \u2217 0.882 \u2217 0.788 \u2217 1.211 \u2217 0.788)\n1 9 = 1.017\n\ud835\udc541 \ud835\udc48 = (1.821 \u2217 2.000 \u2217 1.684 \u2217 1.684 \u2217 1.388 \u2217 1.388 \u2217 1.149 \u2217 1.687 \u2217 1.149)\n1 9 = 1.524\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc541 = \u23081.017,1.524\u230b\nStep 5.The distances of the alternative cities from the border approximation area (BAA) are calculated to compute the distance matrix \ud835\udc44 (Table 11) according to the interval valued Euclidean distance operator [shown in equations (30) and (31)].\nStep 6.The closeness coefficients/final score \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56) of the alternatives sites to the ideal/optimal alternative site are calculated by equations (32). For example,\n\ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc342) = 0.603 + 0.007 + 0.181 + 0.624 + 0.494 + 0.077 + 0.020 = 2.006\n\ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc348) = 0.253 \u2212 0.016 + 0.041 \u2212 0.229 + 0.494 \u2212 0.082 + 0.029 = 0.492\nRanking is done (Table 12) according to the better \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56) value the better alternative. Here, \ud835\udc342 turned out to be best choice."}, {"heading": "5. Comparative analysis and validity testing of the proposed method", "text": "5.1 Comparisons with rough TOPSIS and rough VIKOR\nIn order to verify the validity of our proposed method, we perform a comparison of our proposed method with two other previous methods including rough TOPSIS (Song et al., 2014) and rough AHP-VIKOR (Zhu et al., 2015) which also deal with rough numbers. The comparisons are shown in Table 13 from which it is clear that the three methods have the same results, which shows the method we proposed in this paper is reasonable.\n5.2 Validity test of the proposed method\nTo determine the validity of the obtained ranking by MCDM methods for a given decision problem, Wang and Triantaphyllou (2008), established following testing criteria. Some researchers, Joshi and Kumar (2016) further studied these validity testing criteria for their proposed method. The validity of the proposed Rough AHP-VIKOR method is tested using these test criteria.\nTest criterion 1. An effective MCDM method should not change the indication of the best alternative on replacing a non-optimal alternative by another worse alternative, without changing the relative importance of each decision criteria The proposed hybrid rough AHP-MABAC method is validated with test criterion 1. The modified decision matrix is considered. Relative weights of criteria are kept same. Here, we have interchanged the values of \ud835\udc343 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc341 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e \ud835\udc345 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc346 respectively, in the initial decision matrix and evaluated by the proposed rough MABAC method. In this case, the obtained ranking is: \ud835\udc342 > \ud835\udc345 > \ud835\udc346 > \ud835\udc348 > \ud835\udc344 > \ud835\udc349 > \ud835\udc347 > \ud835\udc341 > \ud835\udc343. This result shows that the proposed rough MABAC method does not change the identification and\nevaluation of the best alternative when a non-optimal alternative is replaced by another worse alternative. Hence the proposed hybrid method is valid under test criterion 1.\nTest criterion 2. An effective MCDM method should follow transitive property. The original MCDM problem is de-composed into a set of smaller MCDM problems {\ud835\udc341, \ud835\udc342, \ud835\udc343, \ud835\udc344, \ud835\udc345, \ud835\udc346, \ud835\udc347} and{\ud835\udc343, \ud835\udc344, \ud835\udc347, \ud835\udc348, \ud835\udc349}. Following the steps of proposed MABAC method, rankings \ud835\udc342 > \ud835\udc343 > \ud835\udc341 > \ud835\udc344 > \ud835\udc347 > \ud835\udc346 > \ud835\udc345 and \ud835\udc343 > \ud835\udc348 > \ud835\udc344 > \ud835\udc349 > \ud835\udc347 are obtained for smaller MCDM problems. Thus the transitive property for MCDM methods is verified for the proposed method here.\nTest criterion 3. If we apply the same MCDM method after decomposing the original problem into smaller problems to rank the alternatives, then the combined ranking of the alternatives should be identical to the original ranking of undecomposed problem. If the rankings of the alternatives of sub-problems are combined together, the final ranking \ud835\udc342 > \ud835\udc343 > \ud835\udc341 > \ud835\udc348 > \ud835\udc344 > \ud835\udc349 > \ud835\udc347 > \ud835\udc346 > \ud835\udc345 is obtained which is identical to the ranking of undecomposed MCDM problem and exhibits transitive property.\n5.3 Further analysis and discussion\nFrom the above comparison it is clear that by using rough AHP-MABAC method, we obtain the same results with other two methods. The main reason of using MABAC method is the simple computation procedure and the stability (consistency) of solution (Pamucar et al. 2015; Xue et al. 2016). The MABAC method is a particularly pragmatic and reliable tool for rational decision making. One more benefit of this method is that it enables us to visualize of performance and assessment of individual MT sites as per each criteria and vice versa (Table 14-15). It shows the pair-wise comparison between each alternative\u2019s performances and the ideal value of each criterion. From the distance matrix we can directly conclude whether an alternative performs better than the ideal value in the considered problem. But TOPSIS and VIKOR methods do not produce such a direct observation. As per result shown in Table (14-15), we can directly apprehend the performances of the nine alternative sites with respect to seven criteria belonging to three operational groups: Infrastructure, Medical Tourism Services, planning and policies. Dimension \u2018Infrastructure\u2019, has three criteria class, namely, Quality of infrastructure of Health Care Institution (C1), Transportation Convenience and city demography (C2) and Informational Infrastructure and distribution channels (C3). Site \ud835\udc342 belongs to upper approximation area according to all criteria whereas \ud835\udc341and \ud835\udc343 belong to upper approximation area according to all criteria\nexcept one. \ud835\udc341 belongs to lower approximation area of \ud835\udc362 while \ud835\udc343 that of\ud835\udc366. But, \ud835\udc343 precedes \ud835\udc341 in the final ranking table since \ud835\udc343 gets cumulative advantage over \ud835\udc341 according to all criteria. Similarly, evaluation can be done for others. A decision maker just looking at the Table (11) or (14) or (15) would be able to do the assessment of the alternative sites and suggest the MT authorities/stakeholders of Medical Tourism Sectors to take care of their planning, infrastructure, and services etc. for better performances and improvements."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "In the present scenario, strong economic boost in infrastructure sector and availability of skilled personnel has paved a smooth way for development of medical tourism in India. As different cities in India acquiring global accreditation for medical tourism spots, analysis and selection of the most suitable one considering city demography and different interests of stakeholders, is the central problem of this paper. For this purpose, nine alternative cities and seven criteria are considered on the basis of experts\u2019 opinion. Criteria are clubbed up in three different operational groups (Infrastructure, medical services, and government policies) which prioritize the criteria, building an impact on evaluation and selection of the sites. This study proposes an integrated rough AHP \u2013 MABAC method to facilitate a more precise analysis of the alternatives, considering several criteria in uncertain environment. Rough number is introduced to aggregate individual judgments, priorities and measure vagueness. Different relative weights of criteria is more realistic in many practical MCDM problems, especially in complex and uncertain environments. Rough AHP enables to measure consistency of preferences, manipulate multiple decision makers and calculate the relative importance for each criterion. On the other hand, MABAC possess simple computation procedure and the stability (consistency) of solution. Particularly, this method also divides the performances of alternatives into two groups: upper and lower approximation area of each criteria function. Here, we utilize rough MABAC to evaluate and classify the alternative cities into positive performer(s) and negative performer (s) in the distance matrix according to each and every criteria under consideration.\nLet us consider the instance that the city Chennai (\ud835\udc342) has been termed \"India's health capital\". Chennai\nattracts about 45 percent of health tourists from abroad arriving in the country and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists (Hamid, 2012). Despite its super-specialty hospitals and world class health infrastructure, Bangalore (\ud835\udc341) is far behind Chennai in attracting international patients. Flight connectivity to Chennai from United States, Middle East and other countries is much better than Bangalore. This is one of the major reasons why Bangalore\u2019s medical tourism industry is still only picking up (Indian Express, May 19, 2013). Our analysis evident that, Bangalore (\ud835\udc342) scores negatively in Transportation Convenience (\ud835\udc362) in the distance matrix (Table 11). So, Chennai needs to keep the present performance and Bangalore\nmust focus to improve on Transportation Convenience (\ud835\udc362) to attract more medical tourists. Similar arguments can be done for other sites. Hence, the proposed method successfully is applied to rough numbers under incomplete data, effectively avoiding vague and ambiguous judgments. Hence, the proposed method is more practical, realistic, comprehensive and applicable for any multi-criteria group decision making in an uncertain environment. In future, rough MABAC would produce interesting hybrid MCDM methods with the combination of other MCDM techniques like, ANP, DEMATEL-ANP, and Shannon Entropy etc."}], "references": [{"title": "Note\u2014A Preference Ranking Organisation Method: (The PROMETHEE Method for Multiple Criteria Decision-Making)", "author": ["J.P.
