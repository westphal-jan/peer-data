INTRODUCTION", "text": "We consider the problem of distributed bisection search using a network of agents. This problem has applications to stochastic root finding algorithms, distributed group testing, object tracking using cameras, and localization in sensor networks. The agents are connected through a topology, and sequentially search for the unknown target X\u2217. Each agent forms a query Zi,t = I(X\u2217 \u2208 Si,t) for some subset Si,t \u2282 X based on its local information about the target location and obtains a noisy response, Yi,t+1, which it uses to update its belief. After this stage, the agents average their log-beliefs with their neighbors. As this process is repeated after several iterations, the agents converge to the correct consensus.\nPrior work on distributed signal processing includes the consensus literature [1, 2]. Extensions to consensus-plusinnovations algorithms with applications to detection and estimation problems includes nodes making noisy observations and implementing a consensus method to spread information around the network. Several such works on distributed estimation include that of [3, 4] in which they show distributed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. In similar spirit, [5, 6] studied the problem of distributed detection and proved convergence rates on the rate of learning the correct hypothesis.\nThe adaptive querying and Bayesian updating are known in the literature as the Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm (PBA). The PBA was first introduced by Horstein [7]. The PBA was shown to be optimal in an information-theoretic sense in the work by Jedynak, et al. [8], and the convergence rate of the single-agent PBA was shown to be exponential in Waeber, et al, [9]. The PBA was generalized in [10] to multiple agents using a centralized controller strategy, and in [11, 12] using a decentralized algorithm based on belief consensus. In [10, 11, 12], the convergence analysis showed that all agents reach consensus to the true target.\nThe contribution of this paper is to propose and analyze a distributed bisection algorithm using a social learning approach. First, we first derive a social learning algorithm (inspired by the work of Lalitha, et al, [5]). Second, we derive an asymptotic performance bound that characterizes the rate of learning in terms of the social influence of nodes on the network and the error probability of each agent. Finally, we show using simulations, that our proposed algorithm outperforms the case of no collaboration and improves the distributed bisection search algorithm presented in Tsiligkaridis, et al, [11]."}, {"heading": "2. PROBLEM FORMULATION", "text": "For concreteness, we focus on the one-dimensional case, i.e, X = [0, 1]. In this case, the query sets Si,t take the form of an interval [0, X\u0302i,t], where X\u0302i,t are the query points. The response to the query Zi,t = I(X\u2217 \u2208 Si,t) is modeled as a binary symmetric channel [8, 10, 11] and is given by:\nYi,t+1 =\n{\nZi,t w.p. 1\u2212 \u01ebi 1\u2212 Zi,t w.p. \u01ebi\nWe define pi,t(x) as the posterior distribution on the target space X = [0, 1] for agent i at time t.

Specifically, using Theorem 7 in Sec. 2.7 from [14]:\nlim t\u2192\u221e\nAti,j = vj\nfor any two nodes (i, j).

Since the rate exponent, Ki, is independent of the agent index, i, the lower bound is the same for all agents and it depends the channel capacities and the eigenvector centrality, v. The values of v represent a centrality measure and the magnitude of social influence of an agent i [5]. The higher\nthe value of vi, the higher larger the contribution that node i has on the network learning rate, K .\nUsing an analogous method, we can analyze Equation (2) for the case of no inter-agent collaboration; the result is an exact convergence rate. For this case, A = IN , and using Equations (2) and (3), pi,t+1(X\u2217) = p\u0303i,t(X\u2217) = pi,t(X\n\u2217) + 2P (yi,t+1|zi,t). Unrolling the preceding equation over t steps, we see that pi,t(x) = \u220ft\u22121 j=0 2P (yi,j+1|zi,j). By taking the logarithm of both sides, dividing by t, and applying the LLN, the convergence rate of the agent beliefs becomes: limt\u2192\u221e log 2 pi,t(x) t\n= C(\u01ebi). For the case of a homogeneous network, i.e. \u01ebi = \u01eb, \u2200i, our distributed algorithm asymptotically learns faster than when agents do not collaborate. In general, the rate exponent of Theorem 1 is a linear combination of agents\u2019 capacities weighed by the eigenvector centrality. This bound is expected to be maximized by placing nodes with low error probability in central locations in networks where they can have a strong social influence on other nodes."}, {"heading": "4. SIMULATIONS", "text": "To validate and strengthen the preceding performance analysis, simulations are performed to show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the belief consensus approach of [11] and the case of no inter-agent collaboration.\nWe randomly generate an irreducible N \u00d7 N adjacency matrix, modeling a random geometric graph [15] (see Figure 1). In this setup, N = 20 and 18 agents have high error probabilities (\u01ebi = 0.40)while the remaining 2 have low error probabilities (\u01ebi = 0.05). The low error agents are the ones with the highest two vi\u2019s, so they can positively affect the high error nodes around them. Figure 1 displays the 2 low error nodes and their connections in blue along with the other nodes and their connections in black.\nFigure 2 shows the average network Mean Squared Error (MSE), MSEavg(t) = 1N \u2211N i=1(X\u0302i,t\u2212X\n\u2217)2, and the worstcase network MSE, MSEmax(t) = maxi(X\u0302i,t \u2212 X\u2217)2, averaged over 150 Monte Carlo trials. We observe that our proposed method outperforms the belief consensus approach of [11] and the case of no collaboration. Regarding the average MSE, all three methods converge to the consensus but our proposed method does so much quicker than the other methods. In terms of worst case MSE, our proposed method remains robust while that of [11] converges slower and the method with no collaboration, has not converged after 75 time steps. From this, we see that the proposed method performs very well even in the worst case and that inter-agent collaboration is advantageous in our target localization task.\nIn addition to the MSE, we also plot log2 p4,t(X \u2217) for both the proposed method and that of no collaboration. The log2 p4,t(X\n\u2217) values represent a base-2 logarithm of agent 4\u2019s belief, an agent with a high error probability. We analytically\nshowed that for the case of no collaboration, a graph of the log2 pi,t(x\n\u2217) vs. t would be a line with slope K = C(\u01ebi) that would serve as an exact bound; with our proposed method, the same graph should be a line with the slope at least as large as the lower bound K =\n\u2211N j=1 vjC(\u01ebi) (14). The anal-\nysis results are affirmed by the simulation results in Figure 3. Here, the dotted lines represent the two preceding bounds and the solid lines represent the calculations of log2 p4,t(X\n\u2217) for each iteration. The solid red line represents the no collaboration method and it lines up with the exact bound displayed in the dotted red line. The solid blue line represents our proposed method and its slope exceeds that displayed by the lower bound with the dotted blue line. The simulations verify our analysis and show that the beliefs generated by our proposed method concentrate fast on the true target location.\nWith our distributed algorithm, it is important to note that we improve the network-wide performance (average and worst case) with a small penalty in performance in the case of no collaboration for the lowest error agent."}, {"heading": "5.
