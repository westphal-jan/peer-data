We propose NSM explanations for 24 evaluation adjectives and argue that they are divided into five groups, each of which corresponds to a particular semantic template. Groups can be outlined as follows: \"first person thinking plus affect,\" e.g. wonderful; \"experience,\" e.g. entertaining; \"experience with physical response,\" e.g. poignant; \"lasting impact,\" e.g. memorable; \"cognitive evaluation, e.g. complex, excellent.

It contains NSM semantic explications for attributive uses of 24 evaluational adjectives, accompanied by brief comments or supporting observations. The assumptions and operating principles of the NSM approach (cf. Goddard (2011), Goddard and Wierzbicka (2014)) are explained in GTT, along with the analytical procedure that led to the explications proposed below. The analysis drew on corpus data from WordsBanks Online, a commercially available corpus service. For background to the study of evaluational language generally, and its application to sentiment analysis, see Martin and White (2005), and Taboada et al. (2011).\nEvaluational adjectives, and the language of evaluation generally, pose fascinating challenges for semantic description, both on account of their inherent subjectivity and because of the sheer number of subtly different meanings involved. For the same reasons, they pose special challenges for computational linguistics and affective computing, including for sentiment analysis (Hudlicka 2003; Taboada et. al 2011; Trnavac & Taboada 2012).\nThe primary goals of the GTT paper are two-fold. The first goal is to apply the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) approach to a selection of evaluational adjectives. The NSM approach is a well developed approach to lexical-semantic analysis, based on reductive paraphrase (Wierzbicka 1996; Goddard & Wierzbicka 2014; Peeters 2006; Goddard 2011; Levisen 2012; and other works). There is a large \u201cback catalogue\u201d of NSM studies into the evaluative lexicon, especially in the domains of emotion and values (e.g. Wierzbicka 1999; Harkins & Wierzbicka 2001), but this is the first NSM study of evaluational adjectives. We present and discuss original NSM explications for a total of 39 such adjectives (15 in the GTT paper; 24 in this report), arguing that they fall into five sub-groups, each conforming to a distinct structure or semantic template. This selection has not been chosen at random, but is a subset of about 40-50 adjectives currently under study.\nOur second goal is to compare these results with the picture developed within the Appraisal Framework (Martin & White 2005; Martin in press; among others). This is arguably the most influential approach to evaluational language, having been developed over the last 15 years under the auspices of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) (Halliday 1985; Halliday & Matthiessen 2014). SFL follows the structuralist tradition insofar as it is based on a system of classifications and oppositions.\nThe five groupings that have emerged from the process of NSM analysis are listed in Table 1, with sample adjectives for each grouping. In the Appraisal Framework (Martin & White 2005), they fall into the category of Appreciation, which has a number of subtypes as discussed later. In Table 1, each grouping has two rows, one for positive and one for negative adjectives.\nIn the rest of this report, we include explications for 24 of the adjectives in Table 1. The templates are listed in the same order as in GTT."}, {"heading": "1 TEMPLATE A WORDS", "text": "Words falling under Template A, e.g. great, wonderful, terrific, awesome, fabulous, terrible, awful, dreadful, can be characterised as \u201cfirst-person thought-plus-feeling\u201d words. These words are overtly subjective, modelled in the explications by the lead component \u2018I think about it like this: ...\u2019. Then follows a model thought, which in this set of explications begins with a strong evaluation: either \u2018this X is very good\u2019 or \u2018this X is very bad\u2019. The special character of each evaluation comes from the thought component, which is different for each adjective. The template is completed with a component indicating that on account of thinking as he/she does, the speaker feels \u2018something very good\u2019 or \u2018something very bad\u2019, as the case may be.\nGreat, wonderful, and terrific are explicated in GTT.

That\u2019s awful for you vs. *That\u2019s dreadful for you. Similarly, a sentence like I\u2019ve got an awful pimple seems quite ordinary, but would be odd with dreadful. \u2022 There are collocational indications that the thought behind dreadful is broader and less personal than for awful, e.g. descriptions of the climate tend to sound better with dreadful than with awful."}, {"heading": "2 TEMPLATE B WORDS", "text": "Words falling under the B Templates (subtypes B1 and B2) are termed \u201cexperiential\u201d evaluators. Examples include: entertaining, delightful for B1, gripping, exciting for B2. They differ from the Template A words in several ways. First, they are less overtly subjective. This is modelled in the explications by a component saying that \u2018someone can think like this (about it): ...\u2019. That is, these evaluational words in this group work by invoking a hypothetical \u2018someone\u2019 and attributing certain thoughts and associated feelings to this hypothetical someone. Second, words in this group say something about someone\u2019s \u201cexperience\u201d of the things being evaluated. Briefly, this means that the thoughts and feelings being depicted are associated with the time period during which someone experiences (watches, reads, or is otherwise exposed to) the stimulus. Third, the B2 Template includes an additional semantic component alluding to a potential bodily effect on the experiencer.\nThe notation => indicates that the details of the top-most section of the explications are not spelt out in full (mainly because they vary somewhat depending on the nature of the noun).

Goddard in press).\na compelling1 \u2013, e.g. a compelling performance, a compelling story =>\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: \u201csomething is happening now\nI want to know what will happen after this, I can\u2019t not (= have to) know it\u201d\nwhen this someone thinks like this, he/she can feel something because of it\nnot like people feel at many other times\nThe word compelling has two distinct meanings: the \u201cexperiential\u201d meaning explicated above, and another purely cognitive meaning, as in phrases like compelling evidence, a compelling reason, argument, etc. Only the \u201cexperiential\u201d meaning (which, incidentally is highly languagespecific) can occur in the frame It\u2019s compelling.\na fascinating \u2013, e.g. a fascinating exploration, conversation =>\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: \u201cI want to know more about this, I want it very much\nwhen this someone thinks like this, he/she can feel something very good because of it\nThere is an intuition that if something is fascinating, we are finding out something new and we want more (i.e. fascinating implies very interesting, at least from a cognitive point of view), but also that fascinating is somehow pleasurable, as captured in the final component.\na touching \u2013, e.g. a touching story, memoir, ballad =>\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: \u201csomeone did something a moment ago, not like people do at many times\nbecause of this, I know that this someone feels something very good towards\nsomeone else at this time\u201d\nwhen this someone thinks like this, he/she can\u2019t not feel something good for a short time\n\u2022 The word touching is not inherently durational (cf. expressions like a touching moment, a touching gesture), but we explicate it above in a durational frame. \u2022 Describing something as touching implies a more or less immediate reaction to an act that shows someone\u2019s strong affection towards someone else. It is akin to heart-warming. \u2022 On a point of detail, the final \u2018feeling\u2019 component contains a time adjunct that states that the feeling is short-lived."}, {"heading": "2.2 Template B1\u2013", "text": "a boring \u2014, e.g. a boring lecture, boring meetings =>\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this about it:\n\u201cthis is like many things were before I don\u2019t want it to be like this I want to do something else now\u201d\nwhen someone thinks like this, he/she can feel something bad because of it\nIn some ways, boring is a semi-converse to interesting, but it is less sophisticated.

This is a simpler and more \u201cexperiential\u201d meaning than one would expect from the verb predict, which is future-oriented."}, {"heading": "2.3 Template B2+", "text": "As mentioned, this group of words follows a very similar structure to the B1 group, but with an extra component suggesting some kind of potential bodily reaction.\na tense \u2014, e.g. a tense, taut thriller; a tense scene\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times:\n\u201csomething very bad can happen after a short time\nI don\u2019t want it to happen I can\u2019t think about other things now\u201d\nat the same time, this someone can think about it like this: \u201cI know that this is not true\u201d\nwhen this someone thinks like this, he/she can feel something because of it\nnot like people feel like at many other times\nat the same time something can happen in this someone\u2019s body because of it\nThe word tense is polysemous. We explicate here its specialised \u201cexperiential\u201d meaning in contexts like a tense movie, a tense scene. In its other meanings, e.g. in expressions like tense muscles, a tense situation, the word implies negative feeling but when used about a movie, book, etc., the implied feeling is not negative. This is accounted for by the component capturing the experiencer\u2019s awareness of the \u201cnon-reality\u201d of the situation. Note that whether or not a film, book, etc. is tense does not depend purely on unpredictability. One may know exactly what will happen but still find it tense.\na suspenseful \u2014, e.g. a suspenseful romance, plot\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this about someone at many times:\n\u201csomething will happen after a very short time\nmaybe it will be very good for this someone, maybe it will be very bad for this someone I want to know what will happen, I want to know it now\u201d\nwhen this someone thinks like this, he/she can feel something because of it\nnot like people feel at many other times\nat the same time something can happen in this someone\u2019s body because of it\nWith suspenseful, the experiencer is sure that something will happen very soon, and the stakes are high, but the potential event in question does not necessarily have to be negative. Suspense can also come from waiting to find out whether something very good will happen, e.g. winning a competition or prize, cf. Don\u2019t keep in me in suspense.\na stunning \u2014, e.g. a stunning performance =>\nduring this time (e.g. when someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain things happen\nto this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: \u201cthis is something very good, I don\u2019t know how it can be like this\nbecause of this I can\u2019t think well at this moment\u201d\nwhen someone thinks like this, he/she can\u2019t not feel something because of it people don\u2019t feel like this at many times at the same time he/she can feel something in the body because of it\n\u2022 Many uses of stunning occur in non-durational contexts, and pertain to the immediate cognitive experience of seeing something remarkable, e.g. stunning looks, or realising that something remarkable has happened, e.g. a stunning victory. Above, however, we explicate the word used in a durational context, as it pertains to the experience of someone watching a film, a performance, etc. \u2022 Data from WordBanks shows that stunning rarely occurs conjoined with other adjectives and almost never occurs with very or extremely (though can be modified with Focus intensifiers, e.g. absolutely, quite, simply)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Template B2\u2013", "text": "a disgusting \u2013, e.g. disgusting behaviour, a disgusting sight\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: \u201csomeone is doing something very bad now, something very bad is happening now\nbecause of it\u201d\nwhen someone thinks like this, he/she can\u2019t not feel something very bad because of it at the same time he/she can feel something bad in the body\nlike people feel at some times when there is something very bad inside the mouth [m]\n\u2022 This explication is simplified from Goddard (2014a). \u2022 In WordBanks, its most common attributive uses are with generic nouns like thing (e.g. the most disgusting thing I\u2019ve ever seen/heard) or abstract nouns indicating human actions and behaviours, e.g. disgusting habit/act, disgusting behaviour. \u2022 Disgusting is hardly ever modified by very, implying that it already includes VERY in its meaning. \u2022 There are semantic links with the interjections Yuck! and Ugh!
