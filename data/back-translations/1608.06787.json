We claim that the argument in [1] does not show that LTL is unsuitable for expressing norms. Instead it shows that a translation of deontic notions such as obligations and permissions into temporal logic which interprets \u2018obligatory\u2019 as \u2018always true\u2019 and \u2018permitted\u2019 as \u2018eventually true\u2019 does not work, as could be expected. However, [1] is now often cited as an argument against using temporal logic for specifying norms in general. We would like to revisit the example which is considered paradoxical when specified in LTL in [1], and show that it is possible to exactly specify the set of conditions on runs which satisfy the norms from the example using standard LTL.\nWe assume that the reader is familiar with temporal logic, in particular with the syntax and semantics of LTL. We use U for the Until operator, G for always in the future, F for some time in the future.\nThe example is as follows (we compress it slightly without changing the meaning, and use the same variable names for propositions):\n1. collection of personal information (A) is forbidden unless authorised by the court (C)\n2. The destruction of personal information collected illegally before accessing it (B) excuses the illegal collection\n3. collection of medical information (D) is forbidden unless collection of personal information is permitted\nAs pointed out in [1], this classifies possible situations as compliant and noncompliant as follows:\n\u2022 situations not satisfying C, where A happens but B happens as well, are weakly compliant\n\u2022 situations where C is false, where A happens and B does not, are violations\n\u2022 situations not satisfying C where D happens are violations\n\u2022 situations not satisfying C but also not satisfying A and D are compliant\nThe classification above is not very precise, since A, B, C, and D are treated as state properties which are true or false at the same time. Later in [1] a temporal relation between A and B is introduced: if C is false and A happens, then B should happen some time after that to compensate for the violation of A1.\nHence it is very easy to classify runs into compliant or violating in LTL:\n\u2022 Fully compliant runs: G(C \u2228 (\u00acC \u2227 \u00acA \u2227 \u00acD))\n(everywhere, either there is a court authorisation, or there is no collection of personal or medical information)\n\u2022 Weakly compliant runs:\nF(\u00acC \u2227 A) \u2227 G(\u00acC \u2227 A\u2192 FB) \u2227 G(\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD)\n(there is at least one violation of prohibition on collection of personal information, but each such violation is compensated by B in the future; there are no violations of prohibition on collecting medical information)\nFinally, violations are specified as follows:\n\u2022 Violating runs: F(\u00acC \u2227 (D \u2228 (A \u2227 \u00acFB)))\nNote that the three formulas above define a partition of all possible runs. Clearly, there is nothing paradoxical in this specification of the set of norms.\nFor the sake of completeness we reproduce here the formalisation of the same set of norms in [1] and analyse where the paradoxical results come from. The set of norms is formalised in [1] as follows:\nN1 \u00acC \u2192 (\u00acA \u2297B)\nN2 C \u2192 FA\nN3 G\u00acA\u2192 G\u00acD 1It would have perhaps been better not to treat B as a state property, but as a property of a run, \u2018data not accessed until destroyed\u2019, which is expressible as \u00acReadUDestroyed, but we will stick with the formalisation in [1] to make comparison easier. Another issue is that instead of requiring B to happen \u2018eventually\u2019, in real life there would be some time limit on when it should happen (such as in the next state).\nN1 is intended to say thatB compensates for a violation \u00acC\u2227A. It uses a connective\u2297 which was introduced for expressing contrary to duty obligations. The truth definition for \u2297 as given in [1] is\nTS, \u03c3 |= \u03c6\u2297\u03c8 iff \u2200i \u2265 0, TS, \u03c3i |= \u03c6 or \u2203j, k : 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k, TS, \u03c3j |= \u00ac\u03c6 and TS, \u03c3k |= \u03c8\nwhere TS is a transition system, and \u03c3 a run in TS. This makes \u2297 equivalent to\nG\u03c6 \u2228 F(\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 F\u03c8)\nThis condition is similar to our characterisation of weakly compliant runs, although it is stated as a property which should be true for all runs. The condition N2 is one of the really problematic ones. It aims to say that if C holds, then A is permitted; \u2018permitted\u2019 is identified with \u2018will eventually happen\u2019. It is quite clear that permission of A cannot be expressed as \u2018A will eventually happen\u2019; the two have completely different meanings. This does not mean that LTL cannot be used for specifying norms, it just means that this particular way of specifying norms in LTL is inappropriate. N4 is problematic in the same way: instead of saying that an occurence ofD is not a violation under the same conditions as when an occurrence of A is not a violation, it says that if A is going to happen then D is going to happen \u2013 which is again a completely different meaning. N3 attempts to say that if A is prohibited then D is prohibited. However, instead it implies that ifA happens (the antecedent G\u00acA is false) then it does not matter whether D happens (the implication is still true). Given this formalisation, which is inappropriate in multiple ways, [1] produces an example run where N1\u2013N4 are true and the prohibition on collecting medical information is violated. The first two states on this run are t1, t2:\nt1 |= \u00acC \u2227 A \u2227D\nt2 |= B\nwhich makes it a weakly compliant run as far as violating prohibition ofA is concerned, but a non-compliant run as far as violating the prohibition of D is concerned. With our LTL specification of the set of norms it is classifid as a violating run since F(\u00acC \u2227D) holds on it. It does satisfy N1\u2013N4, but clearly the problem is with N1\u2013N4 rather than with the intrinsic difficulty of expressing norm violating patterns in temporal logic."}], "references": [{"title": "Thou shalt is not you will", "author": ["Guido Governatori"], "venue": "In Ted Sichelman and Katie Atkinson, editors, Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ICAIL", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2015}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 0, "context": "In particular, we address the argument from [1] that norms cannot be expressed in Linear Time Temporal Logic (LTL).", "startOffset": 44, "endOffset": 47}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "Recently, doubts were raised in [1] regarding suitability of LTL and other temporal logics for expressing \u2018real life\u2019 norms.", "startOffset": 32, "endOffset": 35}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "We claim that the argument in [1] does not show that LTL is unsuitable for expressing norms.", "startOffset": 30, "endOffset": 33}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "However, [1] is now often cited as an argument against using temporal logic for specifying norms in general.", "startOffset": 9, "endOffset": 12}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "We would like to revisit the example which is considered paradoxical when specified in LTL in [1], and show that it is possible to exactly specify the set of conditions on runs which satisfy the norms from the example using standard LTL.", "startOffset": 94, "endOffset": 97}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "As pointed out in [1], this classifies possible situations as compliant and noncompliant as follows:", "startOffset": 18, "endOffset": 21}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "Later in [1] a temporal relation between A and B is introduced: if C is false and A happens, then B should happen some time after that to compensate for the violation of A1.", "startOffset": 9, "endOffset": 12}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "For the sake of completeness we reproduce here the formalisation of the same set of norms in [1] and analyse where the paradoxical results come from.", "startOffset": 93, "endOffset": 96}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "The set of norms is formalised in [1] as follows: N1 \u00acC \u2192 (\u00acA \u2297B) N2 C \u2192 FA N3 G\u00acA\u2192 G\u00acD 1It would have perhaps been better not to treat B as a state property, but as a property of a run, \u2018data not accessed until destroyed\u2019, which is expressible as \u00acReadUDestroyed, but we will stick with the formalisation in [1] to make comparison easier.", "startOffset": 34, "endOffset": 37}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "The set of norms is formalised in [1] as follows: N1 \u00acC \u2192 (\u00acA \u2297B) N2 C \u2192 FA N3 G\u00acA\u2192 G\u00acD 1It would have perhaps been better not to treat B as a state property, but as a property of a run, \u2018data not accessed until destroyed\u2019, which is expressible as \u00acReadUDestroyed, but we will stick with the formalisation in [1] to make comparison easier.", "startOffset": 309, "endOffset": 312}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "The truth definition for \u2297 as given in [1] is", "startOffset": 39, "endOffset": 42}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "Given this formalisation, which is inappropriate in multiple ways, [1] produces an example run where N1\u2013N4 are true and the prohibition on collecting medical information is violated.", "startOffset": 67, "endOffset": 70}], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "In this short note we address the issue of expressing norms (such as obligations and prohibitions) in temporal logic.
