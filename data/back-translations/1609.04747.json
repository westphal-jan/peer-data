At the same time, every state-of-the-art Deep Learning library contains implementations of various algorithms to optimize gradient descent (e.g. lasagne\u2019s2, caffe\u2019s3, and keras\u20194 documentation). These algorithms, however, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by.\nThis article aims at providing the reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms for optimizing gradient descent that will help her put them to use. In Section 2, we are first going to look at the different variants of gradient descent. We will then briefly summarize challenges during training in Section 3. Subsequently, in Section 4, we will introduce the most common optimization algorithms by showing their motivation to resolve these challenges and how this leads to the derivation of their update rules. Afterwards, in Section 5, we will take a short look at algorithms and architectures to optimize gradient descent in a parallel and distributed setting. Finally, we will consider additional strategies that are helpful for optimizing gradient descent in Section 6.\nGradient descent is a way to minimize an objective function J(\u03b8) parameterized by a model\u2019s parameters \u03b8 \u2208 Rd by updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function \u2207\u03b8J(\u03b8) w.r.t. to the parameters. The learning rate \u03b7 determines the size of the steps we take to reach a (local) minimum. In other words, we follow the direction of the slope of the surface created by the objective function downhill until we reach a valley.5\n\u2217This paper originally appeared as a blog post at http://sebastianruder.com/ optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html on 19 January 2016.\n2http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/updates.html 3http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/tutorial/solver.html 4http://keras.io/optimizers/ 5If you are unfamiliar with gradient descent, you can find a good introduction on optimizing neural networks\nat http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-1/.\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n04 74\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n5 Se\np 20"}, {"heading": "2 Gradient descent variants", "text": "There are three variants of gradient descent, which differ in how much data we use to compute the gradient of the objective function.

Batch gradient descent also does not allow us to update our model online, i.e. with new examples on-the-fly.\nIn code, batch gradient descent looks something like this:\nfor i in range(nb_epochs ): params_grad = evaluate_gradient(loss_function , data , params) params = params - learning_rate * params_grad\nFor a pre-defined number of epochs, we first compute the gradient vector params_grad of the loss function for the whole dataset w.r.t. our parameter vector params. Note that state-of-the-art deep learning libraries provide automatic differentiation that efficiently computes the gradient w.r.t. some parameters. If you derive the gradients yourself, then gradient checking is a good idea.6\nWe then update our parameters in the direction of the gradients with the learning rate determining how big of an update we perform. Batch gradient descent is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum for convex error surfaces and to a local minimum for non-convex surfaces."}, {"heading": "2.2 Stochastic gradient descent", "text": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in contrast performs a parameter update for each training example x(i) and label y(i):\n\u03b8 = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7 \u00b7 \u2207\u03b8J(\u03b8;x(i); y(i)) (2)\nBatch gradient descent performs redundant computations for large datasets, as it recomputes gradients for similar examples before each parameter update. SGD does away with this redundancy by performing one update at a time. It is therefore usually much faster and can also be used to learn online. SGD performs frequent updates with a high variance that cause the objective function to fluctuate heavily as in Figure 1.\nWhile batch gradient descent converges to the minimum of the basin the parameters are placed in, SGD\u2019s fluctuation, on the one hand, enables it to jump to new and potentially better local minima. On the other hand, this ultimately complicates convergence to the exact minimum, as SGD will keep overshooting. However, it has been shown that when we slowly decrease the learning rate, SGD shows the same convergence behaviour as batch gradient descent, almost certainly converging to a local or the global minimum for non-convex and convex optimization respectively. Its code fragment simply adds a loop over the training examples and evaluates the gradient w.r.t. each example. Note that we shuffle the training data at every epoch as explained in Section 6.1.\nfor i in range(nb_epochs ): np.random.shuffle(data) for example in data:\nparams_grad = evaluate_gradient(loss_function , example , params) params = params - learning_rate * params_grad\n6Refer to http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/ for some great tips on how to check gradients properly."}, {"heading": "2.3 Mini-batch gradient descent", "text": "Mini-batch gradient descent finally takes the best of both worlds and performs an update for every mini-batch of n training examples:\n\u03b8 = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7 \u00b7 \u2207\u03b8J(\u03b8;x(i:i+n); y(i:i+n)) (3)\nThis way, it a) reduces the variance of the parameter updates, which can lead to more stable convergence; and b) can make use of highly optimized matrix optimizations common to state-of-the-art deep learning libraries that make computing the gradient w.r.t. a mini-batch very efficient. Common mini-batch sizes range between 50 and 256, but can vary for different applications. Mini-batch gradient descent is typically the algorithm of choice when training a neural network and the term SGD usually is employed also when mini-batches are used. Note: In modifications of SGD in the rest of this post, we leave out the parameters x(i:i+n); y(i:i+n) for simplicity.\nIn code, instead of iterating over examples, we now iterate over mini-batches of size 50:\nfor i in range(nb_epochs ): np.random.shuffle(data) for batch in get_batches(data , batch_size =50):\nparams_grad = evaluate_gradient(loss_function , batch , params) params = params - learning_rate * params_grad"}, {"heading": "3 Challenges", "text": "Vanilla mini-batch gradient descent, however, does not guarantee good convergence, but offers a few challenges that need to be addressed:\n\u2022 Choosing a proper learning rate can be difficult. A learning rate that is too small leads to painfully slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large can hinder convergence and cause the loss function to fluctuate around the minimum or even to diverge.\n\u2022 Learning rate schedules [17] try to adjust the learning rate during training by e.g. annealing, i.e. reducing the learning rate according to a pre-defined schedule or when the change in objective between epochs falls below a threshold. These schedules and thresholds, however, have to be defined in advance and are thus unable to adapt to a dataset\u2019s characteristics [4].\n\u2022 Additionally, the same learning rate applies to all parameter updates. If our data is sparse and our features have very different frequencies, we might not want to update all of them to the same extent, but perform a larger update for rarely occurring features.\n\u2022 Another key challenge of minimizing highly non-convex error functions common for neural networks is avoiding getting trapped in their numerous suboptimal local minima. Dauphin et al. [5] argue that the difficulty arises in fact not from local minima but from saddle points, i.e. points where one dimension slopes up and another slopes down. These saddle points are usually surrounded by a plateau of the same error, which makes it notoriously hard for SGD to escape, as the gradient is close to zero in all dimensions."}, {"heading": "4 Gradient descent optimization algorithms", "text": "In the following, we will outline some algorithms that are widely used by the Deep Learning community to deal with the aforementioned challenges.

In these scenarios, SGD oscillates across the slopes of the ravine while only making hesitant progress along the bottom towards the local optimum as in Figure 2a.\nMomentum [16] is a method that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations as can be seen in Figure 2b. It does this by adding a fraction \u03b3 of the update vector of the past time step to the current update vector8\nvt = \u03b3vt\u22121 + \u03b7\u2207\u03b8J(\u03b8) \u03b8 = \u03b8 \u2212 vt\n(4)\nThe momentum term \u03b3 is usually set to 0.9 or a similar value.\nEssentially, when using momentum, we push a ball down a hill. The ball accumulates momentum as it rolls downhill, becoming faster and faster on the way (until it reaches its terminal velocity, if there is air resistance, i.e. \u03b3 < 1). The same thing happens to our parameter updates: The momentum term increases for dimensions whose gradients point in the same directions and reduces updates for dimensions whose gradients change directions. As a result, we gain faster convergence and reduced oscillation."}, {"heading": "4.2 Nesterov accelerated gradient", "text": "However, a ball that rolls down a hill, blindly following the slope, is highly unsatisfactory. We would like to have a smarter ball, a ball that has a notion of where it is going so that it knows to slow down before the hill slopes up again.\nNesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) [13] is a way to give our momentum term this kind of prescience. We know that we will use our momentum term \u03b3vt\u22121 to move the parameters \u03b8. Computing \u03b8\u2212\u03b3vt\u22121 thus gives us an approximation of the next position of the parameters (the gradient is missing for the full update), a rough idea where our parameters are going to be. We can now effectively look ahead by calculating the gradient not w.r.t. to our current parameters \u03b8 but w.r.t. the approximate future position of our parameters:\nvt = \u03b3 vt\u22121 + \u03b7\u2207\u03b8J(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b3vt\u22121) \u03b8 = \u03b8 \u2212 vt\n(5)\n7https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization 8Some implementations exchange the signs in the equations.\nAgain, we set the momentum term \u03b3 to a value of around 0.9. While Momentum first computes the current gradient (small blue vector in Figure 3) and then takes a big jump in the direction of the updated accumulated gradient (big blue vector), NAG first makes a big jump in the direction of the previous accumulated gradient (brown vector), measures the gradient and then makes a correction (green vector). This anticipatory update prevents us from going too fast and results in increased responsiveness, which has significantly increased the performance of RNNs on a number of tasks [2].9\nNow that we are able to adapt our updates to the slope of our error function and speed up SGD in turn, we would also like to adapt our updates to each individual parameter to perform larger or smaller updates depending on their importance."}, {"heading": "4.3 Adagrad", "text": "Adagrad [7] is an algorithm for gradient-based optimization that does just this: It adapts the learning rate to the parameters, performing larger updates for infrequent and smaller updates for frequent parameters. For this reason, it is well-suited for dealing with sparse data. Dean et al. [6] have found that Adagrad greatly improved the robustness of SGD and used it for training large-scale neural nets at Google, which \u2013 among other things \u2013 learned to recognize cats in Youtube videos10. Moreover, Pennington et al. [15] used Adagrad to train GloVe word embeddings, as infrequent words require much larger updates than frequent ones.\nPreviously, we performed an update for all parameters \u03b8 at once as every parameter \u03b8i used the same learning rate \u03b7. As Adagrad uses a different learning rate for every parameter \u03b8i at every time step t, we first show Adagrad\u2019s per-parameter update, which we then vectorize. For brevity, we set gt,i to be the gradient of the objective function w.r.t. to the parameter \u03b8i at time step t:\ngt,i = \u2207\u03b8J(\u03b8i) (6)\nThe SGD update for every parameter \u03b8i at each time step t then becomes:\n\u03b8t+1,i = \u03b8t,i \u2212 \u03b7 \u00b7 gt,i (7)\nIn its update rule, Adagrad modifies the general learning rate \u03b7 at each time step t for every parameter \u03b8i based on the past gradients that have been computed for \u03b8i:\n\u03b8t+1,i = \u03b8t,i \u2212 \u03b7\u221a\nGt,ii + \u00b7 gt,i (8)\nGt \u2208 Rd\u00d7d here is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element i, i is the sum of the squares of the gradients w.r.t. \u03b8i up to time step t11, while is a smoothing term that avoids division by zero (usually on the order of 1e\u2212 8). Interestingly, without the square root operation, the algorithm performs much worse.\n9Refer to http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/ for another explanation of the intuitions behind NAG, while Ilya Sutskever gives a more detailed overview in his PhD thesis [18].\n10http://www.wired.com/2012/06/google-x-neural-network/ 11Duchi et al. [7] give this matrix as an alternative to the full matrix containing the outer products of all previous gradients, as the computation of the matrix square root is infeasible even for a moderate number of parameters d.\nAs Gt contains the sum of the squares of the past gradients w.r.t. to all parameters \u03b8 along its diagonal, we can now vectorize our implementation by performing an element-wise matrix-vector multiplication between Gt and gt:\n\u03b8t+1 = \u03b8t \u2212 \u03b7\u221a\nGt + gt. (9)\nOne of Adagrad\u2019s main benefits is that it eliminates the need to manually tune the learning rate. Most implementations use a default value of 0.01 and leave it at that.\nAdagrad\u2019s main weakness is its accumulation of the squared gradients in the denominator: Since every added term is positive, the accumulated sum keeps growing during training. This in turn causes the learning rate to shrink and eventually become infinitesimally small, at which point the algorithm is no longer able to acquire additional knowledge. The following algorithms aim to resolve this flaw."}, {"heading": "4.4 Adadelta", "text": "Adadelta [21] is an extension of Adagrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate. Instead of accumulating all past squared gradients, Adadelta restricts the window of accumulated past gradients to some fixed size w.\nInstead of inefficiently storing w previous squared gradients, the sum of gradients is recursively defined as a decaying average of all past squared gradients. The running average E[g2]t at time step t then depends (as a fraction \u03b3 similarly to the Momentum term) only on the previous average and the current gradient:\nE[g2]t = \u03b3E[g 2]t\u22121 + (1\u2212 \u03b3)g2t (10)\nWe set \u03b3 to a similar value as the momentum term, around 0.9. For clarity, we now rewrite our vanilla SGD update in terms of the parameter update vector \u2206\u03b8t:\n\u2206\u03b8t = \u2212\u03b7 \u00b7 gt,i \u03b8t+1 = \u03b8t + \u2206\u03b8t\n(11)\nThe parameter update vector of Adagrad that we derived previously thus takes the form:\n\u2206\u03b8t = \u2212 \u03b7\u221a\nGt + gt (12)\nWe now simply replace the diagonal matrix Gt with the decaying average over past squared gradients E[g2]t:\n\u2206\u03b8t = \u2212 \u03b7\u221a\nE[g2]t + gt (13)\nAs the denominator is just the root mean squared (RMS) error criterion of the gradient, we can replace it with the criterion short-hand:\n\u2206\u03b8t = \u2212 \u03b7\nRMS[g]t gt (14)\nThe authors note that the units in this update (as well as in SGD, Momentum, or Adagrad) do not match, i.e. the update should have the same hypothetical units as the parameter. To realize this, they first define another exponentially decaying average, this time not of squared gradients but of squared parameter updates:\nE[\u2206\u03b82]t = \u03b3E[\u2206\u03b8 2]t\u22121 + (1\u2212 \u03b3)\u2206\u03b82t (15)\nThe root mean squared error of parameter updates is thus:\nRMS[\u2206\u03b8]t = \u221a E[\u2206\u03b82]t + (16)\nSince RMS[\u2206\u03b8]t is unknown, we approximate it with the RMS of parameter updates until the previous time step. Replacing the learning rate \u03b7 in the previous update rule with RMS[\u2206\u03b8]t\u22121 finally yields the Adadelta update rule:\n\u2206\u03b8t = \u2212 RMS[\u2206\u03b8]t\u22121 RMS[g]t gt\n\u03b8t+1 = \u03b8t + \u2206\u03b8t\n(17)\nWith Adadelta, we do not even need to set a default learning rate, as it has been eliminated from the update rule."}, {"heading": "4.5 RMSprop", "text": "RMSprop is an unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed by Geoff Hinton in Lecture 6e of his Coursera Class12.\nRMSprop and Adadelta have both been developed independently around the same time stemming from the need to resolve Adagrad\u2019s radically diminishing learning rates.

Note that Adagrad, Adadelta, and RMSprop headed off immediately in the right direction and converged similarly fast, while Momentum and NAG were led off-track, evoking the image of a ball rolling down the hill. NAG, however, was able to correct its course sooner due to its increased responsiveness by looking ahead and headed to the minimum.\nFigure 4b shows the behaviour of the algorithms at a saddle point, i.e. a point where one dimension has a positive slope, while the other dimension has a negative slope, which pose a difficulty for SGD as we mentioned before. Notice here that SGD, Momentum, and NAG find it difficulty to break symmetry, although the latter two eventually manage to escape the saddle point, while Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adadelta quickly head down the negative slope, with Adadelta leading the charge.\nAs we can see, the adaptive learning-rate methods, i.e. Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam are most suitable and provide the best convergence for these scenarios."}, {"heading": "4.8 Which optimizer to use?", "text": "So, which optimizer should you use?

It is identical to Adadelta, except that Adadelta uses the RMS of parameter updates in the numinator update rule. Adam, finally, adds bias-correction and momentum to RMSprop. Insofar, RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adam are very similar algorithms that do well in similar circumstances. Kingma et al. [9] show that its bias-correction helps Adam slightly outperform RMSprop towards the end of optimization as gradients become sparser. Insofar, Adam might be the best overall choice.\n13Also have a look at http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/ for a description of the same images by Karpathy and another concise overview of the algorithms discussed.\nInterestingly, many recent papers use vanilla SGD without momentum and a simple learning rate annealing schedule. As has been shown, SGD usually achieves to find a minimum, but it might take significantly longer than with some of the optimizers, is much more reliant on a robust initialization and annealing schedule, and may get stuck in saddle points rather than local minima.

[12] add noise that follows a Gaussian distribution N(0, \u03c32t ) to each gradient update:\ngt,i = gt,i +N(0, \u03c3 2 t ) (22)\nThey anneal the variance according to the following schedule:\n\u03c32t = \u03b7\n(1 + t)\u03b3 (23)\nThey show that adding this noise makes networks more robust to poor initialization and helps training particularly deep and complex networks. They suspect that the added noise gives the model more chances to escape and find new local minima, which are more frequent for deeper models.\n16NIPS 2015 Tutorial slides, slide 63, http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/talks/ DL-Tutorial-NIPS2015.pdf"}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this blog post, we have initially looked at the three variants of gradient descent, among which mini-batch gradient descent is the most popular. We have then investigated algorithms that are most commonly used for optimizing SGD: Momentum, Nesterov accelerated gradient, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Adam, as well as different algorithms to optimize asynchronous SGD. Finally, we\u2019ve considered other strategies to improve SGD such as shuffling and curriculum learning, batch normalization, and early stopping."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Gradient descent optimization algorithms, while increasingly popular, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by. This article aims to provide the reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing gradient descent.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
