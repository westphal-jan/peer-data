Introduction", "text": "Real world datasets commonly show the particularity to have a number of samples of a given class under-represented compared to other classes. This imbalance gives rise to the \u201cclass imbalance\u201d problem (Prati et al., 2009) (or \u201ccurse of imbalanced datasets\u201d) which is the problem of learning a concept from the class that has a small number of samples.\nThe class imbalance problem has been encountered in multiple areas such as telecommunication managements, bioinformatics, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis, and has been considered one of the top 10 problems in data mining and pattern recognition (Yang and Wu, 2006; Rastgoo et al., 2016). Imbalanced data substantially compromises the learning process, since most of the standard machine learning algorithms expect balanced class distribution or an equal misclassification cost (He and Garcia, 2009). For this reason, several ap-\nc\u00a92016 Guillaume Lema\u0302\u0131tre, Fernando Nogueira, and Christos K. Aridas.\nproaches have been specifically proposed to handle such datasets. Such standalone methods have been implemented mainly in R language (Torgo, 2010; Kuhn, 2015; Dal Pozzolo et al., 2013). Up to our knowledge, however, there is no python toolbox allowing such processing while cutting edge machine learning toolboxes are available (Pedregosa et al., 2011; Sonnenburg et al., 2010).\nIn this paper, we present the imbalanced-learn API, a python toolbox to tackle the curse of imbalanced datasets in machine learning. The following sections present the project vision, a snapshot of the API, an overview of the implemented methods, and finally, the conclusion of this paper, including future functionalities for the imbalanced-learn API."}, {"heading": "2. Project management", "text": "Quality insurance In order to ensure code quality, a set of unit tests is provided leading to a coverage of 99 % for the release 0.1.8 of the toolbox. Furthermore, the code consistency is ensured by following PEP8 standards and each new contribution is automatically checked through landscape, which provides metrics related to code quality. Continuous integration To allow user and developer to either use or contribute to this toolbox, Travis CI is used to easily integrate new code and ensure back-compatibility.\nCommunity-based development All the development is performed in a collaborative manner. Tools such as git, GitHub, and gitter are used to ease collaborative programming, issue tracking, code integration, and idea discussions.\nDocumentation A consistent API documentation is provided using sphinx and numpydoc. An additional installation guide and examples are also provided and centralized on GitHub1. Project relevance At the edition time, the repository is visited no less than 2, 000 per week, attracting about 300 unique visitors per week. Additionally, the toolbox is supported by scikit-learn through the scikit-learn-contrib projects."}, {"heading": "3.

Implemented methods", "text": "The imbalanced-learn toolbox provides four different strategies to tackle the problem of imbalanced dataset: (i) under-sampling, (ii) over-sampling, (iii) a combination of both, and (iv) ensemble learning. The following subsections give an overview of the techniques implemented."}, {"heading": "4.1 Notation and background", "text": "Let \u03c7 an imbalanced dataset with \u03c7min and \u03c7maj being the subset of samples belonging to the minority and majority class, respectively. The balancing ratio of the dataset \u03c7 is defined as:\nr\u03c7 = |\u03c7min|\n|\u03c7maj | , (1)\nwhere | \u00b7 | denotes the cardinality of a set. The balancing process is equivalent to resample \u03c7 into a new dataset \u03c7res such that r\u03c7 > r\u03c7res ."}, {"heading": "4.2 Under-sampling", "text": "Under-sampling refers to the process of reducing the number of samples in \u03c7maj . The implemented methods can be categorized into 2 groups: (i) fixed under-sampling and (ii) cleaning under-sampling.\nFixed under-sampling refer to the methods which perform under-sampling to obtain the appropriate balancing ratio r\u03c7res . The implemented methods perform the under-sampling based on different criteria such as: (i) random selection, (ii) clustering, (iii) nearest neighbours rule (i.e., NearMiss (Mani and Zhang, 2003)), and (iv) classification accuracy (i.e., instance hardness threshold (Smith et al., 2014)).\nIn the contrary to the previous methods, cleaning under-sampling do not allow to reach specifically the balancing ratio r\u03c7res , but rather clean the feature space based on some empirical criteria. These criteria are derived from the nearest neighbours rule, namely: (i) condensed nearest neighbours (Hart, 1968), (ii) edited nearest neighbours (Wilson, 1972), (iii) one-sided selection (Kubat et al., 1997), (iv) neighbourhood cleaning rule (Laurikkala, 2001), and (v) Tomek links (Tomek, 1976)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Over-sampling", "text": "In the contrary to under-sampling, data balancing can be performed by over-sampling such that new samples are generated in \u03c7min to reach the balancing ratio r\u03c7res . Two methods are currently available: (i) Random over-sampling is performed by randomly replicating the samples of \u03c7min to obtain the appropriate balancing ratio r\u03c7res and SMOTE which randomly generate new samples between tuple of nearest neighbours of \u03c7min (Chawla et al.,\n2002). Different variants of this algorithm have been proposed: SMOTE borderline 1 & 2 (Han et al., 2005) and SMOTE SVM (Nguyen et al., 2011)."}, {"heading": "4.4 Combination of over- and under-sampling", "text": "SMOTE over-sampling can lead to over-fitting which can be avoided by applying cleaning under-sampling methods (Prati et al., 2009). In that regard, Batista et al. (2003) combined SMOTE either with Tomek links or edited nearest neighbours."}, {"heading": "4.5 Ensemble learning", "text": "Under-sampling methods imply that samples of the majority class are lost during the balancing procedure. Ensemble methods offer an alternative to use most of the samples. In fact, an ensemble of balanced sets is created and used to later train any classifier. Two methods are available to build such ensemble proposed by Liu et al. (2009): EasyEnsemble and BalanceCascade. The former is based on iteratively applying the random under-sampling method to build several sets, each of them with a desired balancing ratio r\u03c7res . The latter differs such that a classifier is used at each iteration to determine the class of the randomly selected samples. Misclassified samples are kept and propagated in the next subset."}, {"heading": "5.
