The classification task is binary when Y = {\u22121, 1}, otherwise it is said multi-task. A simple but powerful classifier consists in retrieving the k nearest neighbor(s) NNk(x) of an unlabeled query point x, and to associate to x the dominant label of its neighbor(s). This rule yields the so-called k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (or k-NN for short). The k-NN rule depends on the chosen distance between elements of X . When the distance is parametric like the Mahalanobis distance, one has to learn the appropriate distance parameter (eg., matrix Q for the Mahalanobis distance). This hot topic of machine learning bears the name metric learning. Weinberger et al. [26] proposed an efficient method to learn a Mahalanobis distance: The Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN) algorithm. The LMNN algorithm was further extended to elliptic Cayley-Klein geometries in [4].

Projective spaces is different from spherical geometry because antipodal\npoints of the unit sphere are identified (they yield the same line passing through the origin). Let RPd = (Rd+1\\{0})/\u0303 denote the real projective space with the equivalence class relation\u223c: (\u03bbx, \u03bb) \u223c (x, 1) for \u03bb 6= 0. A point x in Rd is mapped to a point x\u0303 \u2208 RPd using homogeneous coordinates x 7\u2192 x\u0303 = (x,w = 1) by adding an extra coordinate w. Conversely, a projective point x\u0303 \u2208 Rd+1 = (x,w) is dehomogeneized by \u201cperspective division\u201d x\u0303 7\u2192 xw \u2208 Rd provided that w 6= 0. The projective points at infinity have the coordinate w = 0. Thus the projective space is a compactification of the Euclidean space. The non-infinite points of the projective space RPd is often visualized in Rd+1 as the points lying on the hyperplane H passing through the (d + 1)-th coordinate w = 1 (with each point on H defining a line passing through the origin of Rd+1). In projective geometry, two distinct lines always intersect in exactly one point, and a bundle of Euclidean parallel lines intersect at the same projective point at infinity.\nIn projective geometry [22], the cross-ratio (Figure 1) of four collinear points p, q, P,Q on a line is defined by:\n(p, q;P,Q) = (p\u2212 P )(q \u2212Q) (p\u2212Q)(q \u2212 P ) . (4)\nThe cross-ratio is a measure that is invariant by projectivities [22] (see Figure 1 (a)), also called collineations or homographies. The cross-ratio enjoys the following key properties:\n\u2022 (p, p;P, P ) = 1,\n\u2022 (p, q;Q,P ) = 1(p,q;P,Q) ,\n\u2022 (p, q;P,Q) = (p, r;P,Q)\u00d7 (r, q;P,Q) when r is collinear with p, q, P,Q.\nA gentle introduction to projective geometry and Cayley-Klein geometries can be found in [22, 24, 25]. We also refer the reader to a more advanced textbook [20] handling invariance and isometries, and to the historical seminal paper [7] of Cayley (1859)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Cayley-Klein distances from cross-ratio measures", "text": "A Cayley-Klein geometry is a triple K = (F , cdist, cangle), where:\n1. F is a fundamental conic,\n2. cdist \u2208 C is a constant unit for measuring distances, and\n3. cangle \u2208 C is constant unit for measuring angles.\nThe distance in Cayley-Klein geometries (see Figure 2) is defined by:\ndist(p, q) = cdist Log((p, q;P,Q)), (5)\nwhere P and Q are the intersection points of line l = (pq) with the fundamental conic F . Historically, the fundamental conic was called the \u201cabsolute\u201d [7]. The logarithm function Log denotes the principal value of the complex logarithm. That is, since complex logarithm values are defined up to modulo 2\u03c0i, we define the principal value of the complex logarithm as the unique value with imaginary part lying in the range (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0].\nSimilarly, the angle in Cayley-Klein geometries (see Figure 2) is measured as follows:\nangle(l,m) = cangle Log((l,m;L,M)), (6)\nwhere L andM are tangent lines to the fundamental conic F passing through the intersection point p of line l and line m (see Figure 2). This formula generalizes the Laguerre formula that calculates the acute angle between two distinct real lines [22].\nThe Cayley-Klein geometries can further be extended to Hilbert projective geometries [9] by replacing the conic object F with a bounded convex subset of Rd. Interestingly, the convex objects delimiting the Hilbert geometry domain do not need to be strictly convex [8].\nThe properties of Cayley-Klein distances are:\n\u2022 Law of the indiscernibles: dist(p, q) = 0 iff. p = q,\n\u2022 Signed distances : dist(p, q) = \u2212dist(q, p), and\n\u2022 When p, q, r are collinear, dist(p, q) = dist(p, r) + dist(r, q). That is, shortest-path geodesics1 in Cayley-Klein geometries are straight lines (clipped within the conic domain D).\n1Cayley-Klein geometries can also be studied from the viewpoint of Riemannian geometry.\nNotice that the logarithm of Cayley-Klein measurement formula is transferring multiplicative properties of the cross-ratio to additive properties of Cayley-Klein distances: For example, it follows from the cross-ratio identity (p, q;P,Q) = (p, r;P,Q) \u00d7 (r, q;P,Q) for collinear p, q, P,Q that dist(p, q) = dist(p, r) + dist(r, q)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Dual conics and taxonomy of Cayley-Klein geometries", "text": "In projective geometry, points and lines are dual concepts, and theorems on points can be translated equivalently to theorems on lines. For example, Pascal\u2019s theorem is dual to Brianchon\u2019s theorem [22].\nA conic object F can be described as the convex hull of its extreme points (points lying on its border), or equivalently as the intersection of all half-spaces tangent at its border and fully containing the conic. This is similar to the dual H-representation and V -representation of finite convex polytopes [13] (\u2019H\u2019 standing for Halfspaces, and \u2019V\u2019 for Vertex). This point/line duality yields a dual parameterizations of the fundamental conic F = (A,A\u2206) by two matrices, where A\u2206 = A\u22121|A| is the adjoint matrix (transpose of its cofactor matrix). Observe that the adjoint matrix can be computed even when A is not invertible (|A| = 0).\nTo a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix (d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1)-dimensional A, we associate a homogeneous polynomial called the quadratic form QA(x) = x\u0303>Ax\u0303. The primal conic is thus described as the set of border points CA = {p\u0303 \u2208 RPd : QA(p\u0303) = 0} using matrix A, and the dual conic as the set of tangent hyperplanes C\u2217A = {l\u0303 \u2208 RPd : QA\u2206(l\u0303) = 0} using the dual adjoint matrix A\u2206.\nThe signature of matrix is a triple (n, z, p) counting the signs of the eigenvalues (in {\u22121, 0,+1}) of its eigendecomposition, where n denotes the number of negative eigenvalue(s), 0 the number of null eigenvalue(s), and p the number of positive eigenvalue(s) (with n+z+p = d+1). For example, a (d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1) symmetric positive-definite matrix S 0 has signature (0, 0, d + 1), while a semi-definite rank-deficient matrix S 0 of rank r < d+ 1 has signature (0, d+ 1\u2212 r, r).\nTable 1 displays the seven types of planar Cayley-Klein geometries (induced by a pair of 3\u00d7 3 dual conic matrices (A,A\u2206)). All degenerate cases can be obtained as the limit of non-degenerate cases, see [22]. Another way to classify the Cayley-Klein geometries is to consider the type of measurements for distances and angles. Each type of measurement is of three kinds [22]: elliptic or hyperbolic for non-degenerate geometries or parabolic for degenerate cases. Using this classification, we obtain nine combinations for the planar Cayley-Klein geometries.\nTraditionally, hyperbolic geometry [2] considers objects inside the unit ball in the BeltramiKlein model. In that case, the fundamental conic that is the unit ball. However, using CayleyKlein geometry, complex-valued measures are also possible even when points/lines fall outside the fundamental conic. With the following choice cdist = \u221212 and cangle = i2 , we obtain [22] (Chapter 20):\n\u2022 A real measurement for angles when points p, q lie inside the primal conic,\n\u2022 When both points p and q lie outside the conic, with l = (pq) denoting the line passing through them:\n\u2013 A real hyperbolic measure if l does not intersect the conic,\n\u2013 A pure imaginary elliptical measure if l does not intersect the conic,\n\u2022 A complex measure (a+ ib) if one point is inside, and the other outside the conic.\nTherefore it may be convenient to use in general the module of Cayley-Klein measures to handle all those possible situations.\nIn higher dimensions [14, 22], Cayley-Klein geometries unify common space geometries (euclidean, elliptical, and hyperbolic) with other space-time geometries (Minkowskian, Galilean, de Sitter, etc.) In the remainder, we consider the non-degenerate hyperbolic Cayley-Klein geometry (signature (0, 0, d+ 1), a real conic) and the non-degenerate elliptic Cayley-Klein geometry (signature (1, 0, d), a complex conic)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Bilinear form and formula for the hyperbolic/elliptic Cayley-Klein distances", "text": "For getting real-value Cayley-Klein distances, we choose the constants as follows (with \u03ba denoting the curvature) :\n\u2022 Elliptic (\u03ba > 0): cdist = \u03ba2i ,\n\u2022 Hyperbolic (\u03ba < 0): cdist = \u2212\u03ba2 .\nBy introducing the bilinear form for a (d+ 1)\u00d7 (d+ 1) matrix S:\nSpq = (p >, 1)>S(q, 1) = p\u0303>Sq\u0303, (7)\nwe get rid of the cross-ratio expression in distance/angle formula of Eq. 5 and Eq. 6 using [22]:\n(p, q;P,Q) = Spq +\n\u221a S2pq \u2212 SppSqq\nSpq \u2212 \u221a S2pq \u2212 SppSqq .

(13)\nNotice that dE(p, q) < \u03ba\u03c0, and that p and q always belong to the domain DS = Rd in the case of elliptic geometry. The link between the principal logarithm of Eq. 5 and the arccos function of Eq. 13 is explained by the following identity: Log(x) = 2i arccos ( x+1 2 \u221a x ) .\nSince the elliptic/hyperbolic case is induced by the signature of matrix S, we shall denote generically by dS the Cayley-Klein distance in either the elliptic or hyperbolic case.\nThose elliptic/hyperbolic distances can be interpreted from projections [22, 18], as depicted in Figure 3.\nIt is somehow surprising that we can derive metric structures from projective geometry.

While good performances are experimentally obtained, this MMC method tends to cluster similar points together and may thus perform poorly in the case of multi-modal data. Furthermore, MMC requires two computationally costly projections at each gradient step: One projection on the cone of positive semi-definite matrices, and the other projection on the set of constraints.\nLMNN [26] on the other hand is a projection-free metric learning method. LMNN learns a global Mahalanobis metric using triplet information: For each point, we take as input a set of k target neighbors which should be brought close by the learned metric, while enforcing a unit margin with respect to points which are differently labelled. Contrary to MMC, LMNN handles well multimodal data, but would optimally require oracle information of which points should be considered as targets of a given point. In practice, this is achieved by computing for each point the list of its k nearest neighbors according to euclidean distance beforehand, but in specific applications the \u201cpoint neighborhoods\u201d can be gained using additional structural properties of the problems at hand.\nWhile we consider in the remainder the LMNN framework, another more flexible approach in metric learning consists in learning local metrics, which allow to obtain a non-linear pseudo-metric while staying in a Mahalanobis framework3, at the cost of greatly amplifying spatial complexity. Therefore, most works on the subject try to obtain a sparse encoding of such metrics. For example, in [12], Fetaya and Ullman learn one Mahalanobis metric per data point using only negative examples (eg., only information on dissimilarity), and obtain sparse metrics thanks to an equivalence with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In [23], Shi et. al. sparsely combine low-rank (one-dimensional) local metrics into a global metric. For a comprehensive survey on local metric learning, we refer the reader to [21]."}, {"heading": "4.1 Large Margin Nearest Neighbors (LMNN)", "text": "Given a labeled input data-set P = {(x1, y1), . . . , (x1, y1)} of n points x1, . . . , xn of Rd, the Large Margin Nearest Neighbors4 (LMNN) [26] learns a Mahalanobis distance (ie., matrix M 0). Since the k-NN classification does not change by taking any monotonically increasing function of the base distance (like its square), it is often more convenient mathematically to use the squared Mahalanobis distance that get rid of the square root. However, the squared Mahalanobis distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality. (It is a Bregman divergence [3, 15, 5].)\nIn LMNN, for each point, we take as input the set of k target neighbors which should be brought close by the learned metric, while enforcing a unit margin with respect to points which have different labels.\nTo define the objective cost function [26] in LMNN, we consider two sets S and R, or target neighbors and impostors:\n\u2022 Distance of each point to its target neighbors shrink, pull(L):\nS = {(xi, xj) : yi = yj and xj \u2208 N(xj)}, (32) where N(x) denotes the neighbors of point x.\n\u2022 Keep a distance margin of each point to its impostors, push(L):\nR = {(xi, xj , xl) : (xi, xj) \u2208 S and yi 6= yl} (33) 3In Riemannian geometry, the distance is a geodesic length L(\u03b3) = \u222b b a \u221a g\u03b3(t)(\u03b3\u0307(t), \u03b3\u0307(t))dt that can be interpreted\nas locally integrating Mahalanobis infinitesimal distances: L(\u03b3) = \u222b b a Dg(\u03b3(t))(\u03b3\u0307(t), \u03b3\u0307(t))dt for a metric tensor g.\n4http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kilian/code/lmnn/lmnn.html\nUsing Cholesky decomposition M = L>L 0, the LMNN cost function [26] is then defined as:\npull(L) = \u03a3i,i\u2192j\u2016L(xi \u2212 xj)\u20162, (34) push(L) = \u03a3i,i\u2192j\u03a3j(1\u2212 yil) [ 1 + \u2016L(xi \u2212 xj)\u20162 \u2212 \u2016L(xi \u2212 xl)\u20162 ] + , (35)\n(L) = (1\u2212 \u00b5) pull(L) + \u00b5 push(L), (36)\nwhere [x]+ = max(0, x) and \u00b5 is a trade-off parameter for tuning target/impostor relative importance, and i\u2192 j indicates that xj is a target neighbor of xi. We define yil = 1 if and only if xi and xj have same label, yil = 0 otherwise.\nThus the training of the Mahalanobis matrix M = L>L is done by minimizing a linear combination of a pull function which brings points closer to their target neighbors with a push function that keeps the impostors away by penalizing the violation of the margin with a hinge loss.\nThe LMNN cost function is convex and piecewise linear [26]. Replacing the hinge loss by slack variables, we obtain a semidefinite program, which allows us to solve the minimization problem with standard solver packages.\nInstead, Weinberger and Saul [26] propose a gradient descent where the set of impostors is re-computed every 10 to 20 iterations.\nIn our implementation, we optimize the cost function by gradient descent:\n(Lt+1) = (Lt)\u2212 \u03b3 \u2202 (Lt)\n\u2202L , (37)\nwhere \u03b3 > 0 is the learning rate, and:\n\u2202 \u2202L = (1\u2212 \u00b5)\u03a3i,i\u2192jCij + \u00b5\u03a3(i,j,l)\u2208Rt(Cij \u2212 Cil) (38)\nwith Cij = (xi \u2212 xj)>(xi \u2212 xj). LMNN is a projection-free metric learning method that is quite easy to implement. There is no projection mechanism like for the Mahalanobis Metric for Clustering (MMC) [27] method.

Thus by transforming the input space into one of the\ncanonical Euclidean/elliptical/hyperbolic spaces, we avoid to perform costly matrix multiplications required in the general bilinear form, and once the structure (say, a k-NN decision boundary or a Voronoi diagram) has been recovered, we can map back to the original space (say, for classifying new observations using the original coordinate system).\nNearest neighbor proximity queries can then be answered using various spatial data-structures. For example, we may consider the Vantage Point Tree data-structures [28, 19].\nIn small dimensions, we can compute the k-order elliptic/hyperbolic Voronoi affine diagram, as depicted in Figure 8.

Table 5 shows the preliminary experimental results. Those results indicate better performance for the mixed model in most (but not all) cases.

We then showed that Cayley-Klein balls have Mahalanobis shapes with displaced centers, and gave the explicit conversion formula. Second, we extended the LMNN framework to hyperbolic Cayley-Klein geometries that were not considered in [4], and proposed learning a mixed elliptic/hyperbolic distance that experimentally shows good improvement over constant-curvature Cayley-Klein geometries.\nThe fact that the Cayley-Klein bisectors are hyperplanes offers nice computational perspectives in machine learning and computational geometry. For example, it would be interesting to study Multi-Dimensional Scaling [11] or Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in Cayley-Klein geometries, or to mesh anisotropically [6] in Cayley-Klein geometries.\nSupplemental information is available online at: https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~nielsen/CayleyKlein/"}], "references": [{"title": "Information Geometry and Its Applications.
