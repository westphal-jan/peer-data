The premise behind the latter genre is that the data samples are obtained by linear transformation of latent representations that are easy to cluster, but in practice, the transformation from latent space to data can be more complicated. In this work, we assume that this transformation is an unknown and possibly non-linear function. In order to restore the \"cluster-friendly\" latent representations and to better cluster the data, we propose a common DR and K-medium cluster approach, whereby DR is achieved by learning a deep neural network (DNN). The motivation is to maintain the benefits of joint optimization of the two tasks, while harnessing the ability of the deep neural network to approximate each non-linear function. In this way, the proposed approach for a broad class of models can work well.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Oct 2016 22:51:06 GMT  (5826kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04794v1", "Main paper: 9 pages; Supplementary material: 3 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:40:26 GMT  (646kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04794v2", "Final ICML2017 version.

The premise behind the latter genre is that the data samples are obtained via linear transformation of latent representations that are easy to cluster; but in practice, the transformation from the latent space to the data can be more complicated. In this work, we assume that this transformation is an unknown and possibly nonlinear function. To recover the \u2018clustering-friendly\u2019 latent representations and to better cluster the data, we propose a joint DR and K-means clustering approach in which DR is accomplished via learning a deep neural network (DNN). The motivation is to keep the advantages of jointly optimizing the two tasks, while exploiting the deep neural network\u2019s ability to approximate any nonlinear function. This way, the proposed approach can work well for a broad class of generative models. Towards this end, we carefully design the DNN structure and the associated joint optimization criterion, and propose an effective and scalable algorithm to handle the formulated optimization problem. Experiments using five different real datasets are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
