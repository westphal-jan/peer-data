Understanding the meanings carried by words, both explicitly and implicitly, is essential for correct and successful communication. The ability to \u201cread between the lines\u201d is important for thorough understanding. In addition to considering collocations, for Chinese, the ways a word that was commonly used and the stories that associated with certain phrases often influence an expression\u2019s connotation sensed by readers of appropriate background knowledge. For instance, \u201c\u68a7\u6850\u201d /wu2 tong2/ 1 literally means Chinese parasol trees, but was often used in poetry about separations. Hence, \u201c\u68a7\u6850\u201d has become a symbol of separation in literary works, similar to that \u201colive twigs\u201d symbolizes peace in the Western world.\nWith the availability of the text files of the poetry, we can search, analyze, and compare their contents to learn about the history of word usage in the literature algorithmically. Software tools allow us to conduct research about poetry in a larger scale and from various perspectives that were practically hard for human experts to achieve before.\nStudying Chinese poetry with computing technologies started at least two decades ago, so we do not mean to provide a comprehensive review of the literature. Lo and her colleagues implemented a computer assisted environment (Lo et al. 1997). Hu and Yu (2001) reported some analyses of unigrams and bigrams in Tang poems, and looked for Chinese synonyms in Tang and Song poems (Hu & Yu 2002). Lee attempted to do dependency parsing of Tang poems (Lee & Kong 2012), and explored the roles of named entities, e.g., seasons and directions, in Tang poems (Lee & Wong 2012).\nWe present some experiences in analyzing and comparing the contents of the Complete Tang Poem (\u5168\u5510\u8a69 /quan2 tang2 shi1/, CTP henceforth) and the Complete Song Lyrics (\u5168\u5b8b\u8a5e /quan2 song4 ci2/, CSL henceforth) with software tools. We choose CTP and CSL because Tang (618-907AD) and Song (960-1279AD) are arguably the most influential stages in the history of Chinese literature and because poem (\u8a69, /shi1/) and lyrics (\u8a5e, /ci2/) are, respectively, the most representative forms of poetry in these dynasties. The influences of the poetry in these dynasties last until today. In addition, we access the China Biographical Database (Fuller 2015, CBDB henceforth) for information about the poets to enhance the overall results of our investigation. We can expand our work to cover literature of earlier and later dynasties whenever the text files and biographical data become available.\n1 Chinese words will be followed by their Hanyu Pinyin and tones.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

There are, respectively, 42,863 and 19,394 items in our CTP and CSL files. Comparing each item with others needs more than 1.9 billion comparisons. The number of comparisons will increase exponentially when we expand our study into Complete Song Poem, which has more than 185 thousand items. Hence, an efficient strategy for comparing poems is very important.\nIn Section 2, we provide more background information about analyzing poetry with software tools, and illustrate the benefits of considering biographical data in the analysis of literary works in Section 3. We turn our attention to algorithms for comparing the contents of poems in Section 4, and, in Section 5, we discuss some interesting findings that we noticed with the help of our tools. We briefly review some challenging issues and make concluding remarks in Section 6."}, {"heading": "2 More Background Information", "text": "Software tools for textual analysis provide ample opportunities for us to study Chinese poetry from a variety of new positions. On comparing the poems of Li Bai (\u674e\u767d)2 and Du Fu (\u675c\u752b), two very famous Tang poets, Jiang (2003) presented his observations from a close-reading viewpoint, and we showed the poets\u2019 differences from a distant-reading standpoint (Liu et al. 2015).\nResearchers may focus their investigation on a special aspect of CTP, e.g., Pan (2015) introduced his observations about words about plants and flowers in Chinese poetry. We consider that colors portray the scenery that could be delivered by a poem; just like that audio effects drive the atmosphere in a movie. The most frequent color in CTP is white (\u767d /bai2/). Following this direction, we have reported some findings about poets\u2019 styles and cultural implications that are related to colors (Liu et al. 2015, Cheng et al. 2015). In addition, we found that red (\u7d05 /hong2/) is the most frequent color in CSL (Liu 2016), and it is possible to link this observation to social and cultural circumstances of the Song dynasty. Poets, both male and female, may express themselves from female perspectives and may use females as metaphors for goals that were hard to achieve (Cheng et al. 2015, Sun 2016).\nIn addition to offering efficient search and comparison capabilities, software tools should facilitate the research by linking more relevant data about the poets. When studying the poems of a specific poet, a researcher should learn about the poet\u2019s life to better appreciate the meanings hidden in the poems.\nWe test this intuition by using the China Biographical Database (CBDB) in our work. CBDB provides information about approximately 360,000 individuals primarily from the 7th through 19th centuries in China. We demonstrate two applications of the information about the birth year, death year, and the alternative names of the poets in CBDB in the next section."}, {"heading": "3 Linking Historical and Literary Analysis", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Social Networks among Poets", "text": "Social network analysis (SNA) proves to be an effective instrument in social science studies. It is perhaps a bit surprising that researchers had attempted to study connections among poets without the assistance of modern computers (Wu 1993), although the results are not perfect.\nIn CTP, a poet may mention another poet\u2019s name in the title or in the content of a poem. It is not difficult to determine whom was mentioned if the complete names were used.\nCBDB records the poets\u2019 alternative names, with which we can find more connections between poets. Often, the alternative names are short, containing just one or two characters, and it is not easy to pinpoint the alternative names in the contents of the poems.\nWe rely on some heuristics to increase the precision of our SNA analysis. For instance, we use the string of the alternative names as an evidence for the relationship between two poets only if one poet mentioned the other\n2 The first word is the surname in Chinese names.\nwith the latter\u2019s full name in other poems. This design choice may hurt the recall rate, and may be adjusted if necessary.\nFigure 1 shows a social network that indicates the mentioning of poets\u2019 names for poets of the highTang period (713-765AD)3. The arrows point to the names that were mentioned in the poems (of the poets whose names are at the tails of the arrows), and thicker arrows suggest higher frequencies.\nThe social networks thus identified can be used for historical and literary studies. After experts verify the relationships, we can record the relationships in CBDB to enrich the contents of CBDB. One may also analyze and compare the styles and subjects of the poems of the poets who frequently mentioned each other to check, for example, whether friends had common interests in their poems."}, {"heading": "3.2 A History of Word Occurrences", "text": "Compiling a comprehensive Chinese word dictionary is a huge, if not formidable, task. Luo (1986) led hundreds of scholars to achieve a contemporary version in 1986. We can enhance the lexicon with more examples from the Tang and Song poetry.\nSpecifically, we apply techniques of information retrieval (Manning et al. 2008) to track how words were used in Chinese literature over time. With the birth and death years of the poets that were recorded in CBDB, we can draw a chart like Figure 2 to show a history about the words4. The horizontal axis of Figure 2 shows the years of Tang and Song dynasties, and the widths of the\n3 Figure 1 was created with Gephi <https://gehpi.org>. 4 Figure 2 was produced with the support of Google Charts <https://developers.google.com/chart/>.\nrectangles that contain the poets\u2019 names5 indicate the poets\u2019 life span. We do not show poets whose life spans are not known in Figure 2. The figure is divided into three parts, from top to bottom, for \u201c\u7d05 \u599d\u201d /hong2 zhuang1/, \u201c\u7384\u9aee\u201d /xuan2 fa3/, and \u201c\u60fa\u5fea\u201d /sing1 song1/, each showing the poets who used these three words.\nAn interface like Figure 2 can provide useful information that a traditional lexicon may not achieve easily. First, the chart offers a distant reading of the history of the word\u2019s occurrences. Although there were more poets in CTP than in CSL, more CSL poets used \u201c\u7d05\u599d\u201d in their works than CTP poets did, which provides hints about social changes (cf. Sun 2016). We can easily see that \u201c\u7384\u9aee\u201d was used only in CTP and that \u201c\u60fa\u5fea\u201d might have been an invented word in the Song dynasty.\nSecond, we can strengthen the charts for close reading, style analysis, and other applications. Researchers can click on the poets\u2019 names to read the poems that actually used the specific words, e.g., \u201c\u7d05\u599d\u201d, for further investigation. Given the time stamps on the horizontal axis, one may study how poets used \u201c\u7d05\u599d\u201d in a specific time period, e.g., high Tang or Southern Song periods. Maybe more interesting is that we can automatically extract the poems that used a specific word to study whether the meanings carried by the word changed over time. Moreover, for language learners, our work can serve as a source of sample poems that used selected words."}, {"heading": "4 Locating Shared Words of Poems", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 Comparing Individual Poems", "text": "We design the algorithm, FindCommon in Figure 3, to compare large sets of poems efficiently.

The characters are indexed for efficient lookup operations, and this list serves as a basis for comparing the contents of individual poems. With the three poems, we may have a V like {\u201c\u5c71\u201d:0, \u201c\u570d\u201d:1, \u201c\u6545\u201d:2, \u2026, \u201c\u6708\u201d:20, \u201c\u591c\u201d:21, \u201c\u6df1\u201d:22, \u201c\u9084\u201d:23, \u201c\u904e\u201d:24, \u201c\u5973\u201d:25, \u201c\u7246\u201d:26, \u201c\u4f86\u201d:27, \u2026}. We chose to index at the character level so that we can find all of the shared characters in poetry.\nAt step 2.1, we convert a poem into a list of indexes (from V) for characters that appeared in the poem. In this illustration, I11 will be \u201c0, 1, 2, \u2026, 27\u201d. P21 is long, so I21 will be a long list of indexes. The sentence \u201c\u591c\u6df1\u6708\u904e\u5973\u7246\u4f86\u201d in P21 will contribute \u201c20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27\u201d to I21.\nAt step 2.2, we compare the lists of indexes for Px and Py to find common characters. Comparing indexes of characters is computationally more efficient than directly comparing the characters. After computing the intersection of I11 and I21, we can determine that \u201c\u6708\u201d, \u201c\u591c\u6df1\u201d, \u201c\u904e\u5973\u7246\u4f86\u201d appeared in P11 and P21. Note that P21 does not use \u201c\u9084\u201d, so C11 will read like { \u2026, \u201c\u6708\u201d, \u201c\u591c\u6df1\u201d, \u201c\u904e\u5973\u7246\u4f86\u201d}. C11 includes characters in P11 and P21, when we compare them. Likewise, each character in \u201c\u591c\u6df1\u6708\u904e \u5973\u7246\u4f86\u201d of P21 appeared in P11, so C21 would read like {\u2026, \u201c\u591c\u6df1\u6708\u904e\u5973\u7246\u4f86\u201d, \u2026}.\nAt step 2.3, we can select the strings that would appear in the final report. If researchers are not interested in unigrams, like \u201c\u6708\u201d in this illustration. We can remove strings that are shorter than a given threshold, and this can be done via F in the input.\nThis example also shows us that there are at least two ways to report the common characters of two poems. In the current case, we may report different common strings, i.e., C11 or C21, depending on our standpoint as we just explained. This can be controled via R in the input. Notice that the choice of standpoint can have a variety of influences on the output, e.g., when we compare P12 and P21, C12 and C21 will contain \u201c\u967d\u659c\u201d and \u201c\u659c\u967d\u201d, respectively.\nIn summary, if we compare P11 and P21 and report all of the common strings (including unigrams) in terms of words in P21, we will find {\u201c\u5c71\u570d\u6545\u570b\u201d, \u201c\u5bc2\u5bde\u6253\u201d, \u201c\u57ce\u201d, \u201c\u7a7a\u201d, \u201c\u820a\u201d, \u201c\u591c\u6df1\u6708\u904e\u5973\u7246\u4f86\u201d, \u201c\u6771\u201d, \u201c\u6dee\u6c34\u201d}. If we compare P12 and P21 and report all of the common strings in terms of words in P21, we will find {\u201c\u820a\u201d, \u201c\u738b\u8b1d\u201d, \u201c\u71d5\u201d, \u201c\u5c0b\u5e38\u5df7\u201d, \u201c\u5bb6\u201d, \u201c\u659c\u967d\u201d }.\nWe produce the following record after we compare P11 and P21 and report all of the common strings (including unigrams) in terms of words in P21. In addition to the common words, we add the poet names and the IDs of the poems that are compared for each record. A record contains three fields that are separated by \u201c|||\u201d. We put P21 in the leftmost field because the common words, which are grouped in the rightmost field, are listed in the terms that appeared in P21, i.e., from the standpoint of P21.\nZhou-Ban-Yan_P21||| Liu-Yu-Xi_P11|||[\u5c71\u570d\u6545\u570b, \u5bc2\u5bde\u6253, \u57ce, \u7a7a, \u820a, \u591c\u6df1\u6708\u904e\u5973\u7246\u4f86, \u6771, \u6dee\u6c34] Zhou-Ban-Yan_P21||| Liu-Yu-Xi_P12|||[\u820a,\u738b\u8b1d,\u71d5,\u5bb6,\u5c0b\u5e38\u5df7,\u659c\u967d] We can offer different viewpoints for researchers to examine the words shared by the poems.\nAlthough we read \u201c\u591c\u6df1\u6708\u904e\u5973\u7246\u4f86\u201d in P21, this string actually came from three shorter strings in P11. i.e., \u201c\u6708\u201d, \u201c\u591c\u6df1\u201d, and \u201c\u904e\u5973\u7246\u4f86\u201d.

On one personal desktop computer with an Intel i7-4790 3.6G CPU, the Microsoft\nWindows 10 64-bit Operating System, 32G RAM, and an ordinary hard disk, it took about 35 hours to complete the comparisons with our Java programs.\nThe computation time will increase noticeably when we include the Complete Song Poems (\u5168\u5b8b\u8a69 /quan2 song4 shi1/, CSP henceforth) in the comparison procedure.

Nevertheless, this is a resourceconsuming step, and we do not want to repeat these basic comparisons again and again.\nTherefore, we organize the search for poem pairs that may have interesting common words into two stages. At the first stage, we employ FindCommon to compare all pairs of poems and find all common strings, including unigrams. We record the common strings of any pair of poems, except those pairs that share no or only one character, assuming that these instances are not of interest.\nThis, as one may expect, will produce huge output files, and, indeed, comparing just CTP and CSL will generate an output file that is larger than 300G in size. The actual size of the output file varies with F and R that we set when we run FindCommon.\nAt the second stage, a researcher will set criteria for selecting records from what we have obtained at the first stage. This will help the researcher to focus on a much smaller set of pairs of poems than those records that we obtain at the first stage. We continue to employ the previous example to illustrate the main idea.\nWe will obtain the following two instances when we compare P11 and P12 at the first stage. At the second stage, a researcher can choose to ignore both instances by asking the filter to output instances in which the list of common words has at least two bigrams.

We design FindCommon to identify and show the poetry that contained the shared words and collocations, and discuss possible applications of such findings. In addition to the Complete Song Poem, we certainly can and should extend the current work to include earlier Chinese poetry, i.e., Shijing (\u8a69\u7d93), Verses of Chu (\u695a\u8fad), and Hangfu (\u6f22\u8ce6), and later ones, e.g., Complete Qing Poem (Zhu 1994) to accomplish a more complete history of words and collocations in Chinese poetry.\nResults of the current work can be improved if we can achieve high-quality word segmentation in poetry. The quality of the corpora based on which we conduct the comparisons directly affects researchers\u2019 observations. As long as we can obtain more reliable and authoritative corpora, we can rerun the analysis and offer better services to humanities researchers.\nResponses to Reviewers\u2019 Comments 1.

We provided the Hanyu Pinyin for the Chinese words in this paper, except those appeared in Figure 2 and Section 4. The majority of Chinese words in Figure 2 are poets\u2019 names. In this Section 4, we discussed words used in poems and listed the poems that we compared. Words and sentences in poems generally convey imagery that is beyond their literal meanings, and it would take many words and require significant background information to appropriately translate the words and poems. Translating poems is a huge task and requires a lifetime dedication, see for example (Owen 2016). Hence, we chose to list just the words, which might be acceptable, because we focused on literal comparisons between poems in this paper.\n4. The algorithm FindCommon listed in Figure 3 can produce all co-occurrences, though the actual output depends on the settings of F ad R. The types of co-occurrences that can be identified and presented to a researcher for further inspection will then depend on the filtering procedure that we outlined in Section 4.2. It is the researcher\u2019s judgement as to what types of co-occurrences that will be examined in the research."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Lik Hang Tsui, Hongsu Wang, and Shuhua Zhang of the CBDB project for the informative conversations with the first author.
