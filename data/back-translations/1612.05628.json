In sequential decision-making, Softmax is often used in situations where it is necessary to maximize benefit, but also to safeguard against problems that arise when you put all your weight behind a single maximum usage decision. Boltzmann's Softmax operator is the most commonly used Softmax operator in this setting, but we show that this operator is prone to misbehavior.

Introduction", "text": "There is a fundamental tension in decision making between choosing the action that has highest expected reward estimate and avoiding \u201cstarving\u201d the other actions. The issue arises in the context of the exploration\u2013exploitation dilemma (Thrun, 1992), non-stationary decision problems (Sutton, 1990), and when interpreting observed decisions (Baker et al., 2007).\nIn the reinforcement learning setting, a typical approach to addressing this tension is the use of softmax operators for value function optimization and softmax policies for action selection. Examples of this commonly used approach include on-policy value function based methods such as\nSARSA (Rummery & Niranjan, 1994) or expected SARSA (Sutton & Barto, 1998; Van Seijen et al., 2009), and policy search methods such as REINFORCE (Williams, 1992).\nAn ideal softmax operator is a parameterized set of operators that:\n1. has parameter settings that allow it to approximate maximization arbitrarily accurately (allowing for reward seeking behavior);\n2. is a non-expansion for all parameter settings (guaranteeing convergence to a fixed point);\n3. is differentiable (making it possible to improve via gradient descent); and\n4. puts non-zero weight on non-maximizing actions (to avoid starving non-maximizing actions).\nLet X = x1, . . . , xn be a vector of values. We define the following operators:\nmax(X) = max i\u2208{1,...,n} xi ,\nmean(X) = 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\nxi ,\neps (X) = mean(X) + (1\u2212 ) max(X) ,\nboltz\u03b2(X) = \u2211n i=1 xi e \u03b2xi\n\u2211n i=1 e \u03b2xi .\nThe first operator, max(X), is known to be a non-expansion (Littman & Szepesva\u0301ri, 1996). However, it is non-differentiable (Property 3), and ignores non-maximizing selections (Property 4).\nThe next operator, mean(X), computes the average of its inputs. It is differentiable and, like any operator that takes a fixed convex combination of its inputs, is a non-expansion. However, it does not allow for maximization (Property 1).\nar X\niv :1\n61 2.\n05 62\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 6\nD ec\n2 01\nThe third operator eps (X), commonly referred to as epsilon greedy (Sutton & Barto, 1998), interpolates between max and mean. Though the operator is a non-expansion, it is non-differentiable (Property 3).\nThe Boltzmann operator boltz\u03b2(X), in contrast, is differentiable. It also approximates max as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, and mean as \u03b2 \u2192 0. However, it is not a non-expansion, as will be shown in a later section (Property 2).\nIn the following section we provide a simple example illustrating why the non-expansion property is important, especially in the context of planning and on-policy learning. We then present an alternative softmax operator that is similar to the Boltzmann operator yet is a non-expansion. We then prove several critical properties of this new operator and conclude with other possible applications."}, {"heading": "2. Boltzmann Operator Is Prone to Misbehavior", "text": "We first show that boltz\u03b2 can lead to problematic behavior in learning. To this end, we ran SARSA with Boltzmann softmax policy (Algorithm 1) on the MDP in Figure 1. The edges are labeled with a transition probability (unsigned) and a reward (signed). Note that in this MDP rewards are functions of states and actions, and not the next states. Also, state s2 is a terminal state, so we only consider two action valus, namely Q\u0302(s1, a) and Q\u0302(s2, b). Recall that Boltzmann softmax policy assigns the following probability to each action:\n\u03c0(a|s) = e \u03b2Q\u0302(s,a)\n\u2211 a e \u03b2Q\u0302(s,a) .\nIn Figure 2, we plot state\u2013action value estimates at the end of each episode of a single run (smoothed by averaging over ten consecutive points). We set \u03b1 = .1 and \u03b2 = 16.53.

There are also variants of the SARSA update rule that converge more generally (Perkins & Precup, 2002; Baird & Moore, 1999; Van Seijen et al., 2009). However, this example is the first, to our knowledge, to show that SARSA fails to converge in the tabular setting with Boltzmann softmax. The next section provides background for our analysis of this example."}, {"heading": "3. Background", "text": "A Markov decision process (Puterman, 1994), or MDP, is specified by the tuple \u3008S,A,R,P, \u03b3\u3009, where S is the set of states and A is the set of actions. The functions R and P denote the reward and transition dynamics of the MDP. More precisely, the expected immediate reward following an action a \u2208 A in a state s \u2208 S before moving to a next state s\u2032 \u2208 S is specified by:\nR(s, a, s\u2032) = E[Rt+1|St = s,At = a, St+1 = s\u2032] ,\nand the probability of this transition is defined by:\nP(s, a, s\u2032) = Pr(St+1 = s\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223St = s,At = a) .\nFinally, \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1), the discount rate, determines the relative importance of immediate reward as opposed to the rewards received in the future.\nA typical approach to finding a good policy is to define and estimate how good it is to be in a particular state\u2014the state value function. The value of a particular state s given a policy \u03c0 is formally defined to be:\nv\u03c0(s) = E \u03c0\n[ Rt+1 + \u03b3Rt+2 + \u03b3 2Rt+3 + ... \u2223\u2223St = s ] .\nIt can also be useful to define the state\u2013action value function, formally defined as:\nq\u03c0(s, a) = E \u03c0\n[ Rt+1+\u03b3Rt+2+\u03b3 2Rt+3+ ... \u2223\u2223St = s,At = a ] ,\nwhich is the expected sum of future discounted rewards upon taking an action a in a state s and committing to policy \u03c0 thereafter.\nWe define the optimal value of a state\u2013action pair\nq?(s, a) = max \u03c0 q\u03c0(s, a).\nIt is possible to define q?(s, a) recursively and as a function of the optimal value of the other state action pairs:\nq?(s, a) = \u2211\ns\u2032\u2208S R(s, a, s\u2032) + \u03b3 P(s, a, s\u2032) max a\u2032 q?(s\u2032, a\u2032).\nBellman equations, such as the above equation, are at the core of many reinforcement-learning algorithms.\nValue iteration is an example of a fundamental planning algorithm for MDPs. It computes the value of the best policy in an iterative fashion using the update rule:\nQ\u0302(s, a)\u2190 \u2211\ns\u2032\u2208S R(s, a, s\u2032) + \u03b3P(s, a, s\u2032) max a\u2032 Q\u0302(s\u2032, a\u2032).\nRegardless of its initial value, Q\u0302 will then converge to q\u2217. Q\u0302 can then be used for decision making.\n(Littman & Szepesva\u0301ri, 1996) generalized this approach by replacing the max operator by any arbitrary operator \u2297 , resulting in the generalized value iteration (GVI) algorithm with the following update rule:\nQ\u0302(s, a)\u2190 \u2211\ns\u2032\u2208S R(s, a, s\u2032) + \u03b3P(s, a, s\u2032)\n\u2297\na\u2032\nQ\u0302(s\u2032, a\u2032).\nAlgorithm 2 GVI algorithm Input: initial Q\u0302(s, a) \u2200s \u2208 S \u2200a \u2208 A and \u03b4 \u2208 R++ repeat\ndiff\u2190 0 for each s \u2208 S do\nfor each a \u2208 A do Qcopy \u2190 Q\u0302(s, a) Q\u0302(s, a)\u2190\u2211s\u2032\u2208S R(s, a, s\u2032)\n+ \u03b3P(s, a, s\u2032)\u2297 Q\u0302(s\u2032, .) diff\u2190 max { diff, |Qcopy \u2212 Q\u0302(s, a)| }\nend for end for\nuntil diff < \u03b4\nCrucially, convergence of GVI to a unique fixed point follows if operator \u2297 is a non-expansion:\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2297\na\nQ\u0302(s, a)\u2212 \u2297\na\nQ\u0302\u2032(s, a) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 max\na\n\u2223\u2223\u2223Q\u0302(s, a)\u2212 Q\u0302\u2032(s, a) \u2223\u2223\u2223,\nfor any Q\u0302, Q\u0302\u2032 and s. As mentioned earlier, the max operator is shown to be a non-expansion, as illustrated by Figure 3. Also, mean, and eps operators are non-expansions. Therefore, each of these operators causes GVI to converge to the corresponding unique fixed point. However, the Boltzmann softmax operator, boltz\u03b2 , is not a non-expansion (Littman, 1996), and so, its fixed point may not be unique.\nNote that we can relate GVI to SARSA by noticing that SARSA update can be thought of as a stochastic implementation of GVI update. For example, under a Boltzmann softmax policy we have:\nE \u03c0\n[ r + \u03b3Q\u0302(s\u2032, a\u2032)\u2212 Q\u0302(s, a) \u2223\u2223\u2223s, a ]\n= \u2211\ns\u2032\u2208S R(s, a, s\u2032) + \u03b3P(s, a, s\u2032)\n\u2211\na\u2032\u2208A \u03c0(a\u2032|s\u2032)Q\u0302(s\u2032, a\u2032) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 boltz\u03b2 ( Q\u0302(s\u2032,\u00b7) ) \u2212Q\u0302(s, a)."}, {"heading": "4.

(For other values of \u03b2, we found a single fixed point.) We also show a vector field visualizing GVI updates under boltz\u03b2=16.53.

Such a probability distribution can then be used for action selection in algorithms such as SARSA.\nIn this section, we address the problem of identifying such a probability distribution as a maximum entropy problem\u2014over all distributions that satisfy the properties above, pick the one that maximizes information entropy (Cover & Thomas, 2006; Peters et al., 2010).

As \u03c9 gets higher, the term corresponding to the best action dominates, and so, the function is positive. Conversely, as beta goes to\u2212\u221e, the term corresponding to the action with lowest utility dominates, and so the function is negative. Finally, by taking the derivative it is clear that the function is monotonically increasing, allowing us to conclude that there exists only a single answer.\nThis policy has the same form as Boltzmann softmax, but with a parameter \u03b2 whose value depends indirectly on \u03c9. This mathematical form arose not from the structure of mm\u03c9 , but from maximizing the entropy. One way to view the use of the mellowmax operator, then, is as a\nform of Boltzmann softmax policy with a parameter chosen adaptively to ensure that the non-expansion property holds.\nFinally, note that the SARSA update under the maximum entropy mellowmax policy could be thought of as a stochastic implementation of the GVI update under mm\u03c9 operator:\nE \u03c0\n[ r + \u03b3Q\u0302(s\u2032, a\u2032)\u2212 Q\u0302(s, a) \u2223\u2223\u2223s, a ] = \u2211\ns\u2032\u2208S R(s, a, s\u2032) +\n\u03b3P(s, a, s\u2032) \u2211\na\u2208A \u03c0(a\u2032|s\u2032)Q\u0302(s\u2032, a\u2032) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 mm\u03c9 ( Q\u0302(s\u2032,.) ) \u2212Q\u0302(s, a)\ndue to the first constraint of the above optimization problem. As such, SARSA with the maximum entropy mellowmax policy is guaranteed to converge."}, {"heading": "7. Experiments On MDPs", "text": "Next, we repeat the experiment from Figure 2 using SARSA with the maximum entropy mellowmax policy and with \u03c9 = 16.53. The results, presented in Figure 6, show rapid convergence to the unique fixed point. Analogously to Figure 5, we provide a vector field for GVI updates under mm\u03c9=16.53. As shown above, using mm\u03c9 ensures that GVI updates move estimates steadily to the fixed point. As a result, GVI under mm\u03c9 can terminate significantly faster\nthan GVI under boltz\u03b2 , as illustrated in Figure 8.\nWe now present two experiments on standard reinforcement learning domains. The first experiment compares softmax policies when used in SARSA with a tabular representation. The second experiment is a policy gradient experiment where a deep neural network is used to directly represent the policy."}, {"heading": "7.1. Multi-passenger Taxi Domain", "text": "We evaluated SARSA with various policies on the multi-passenger taxi domain introduced by (Dearden et al., 1998). (See Figure 9.)\nOne challenging aspect of this domain is that it admits many locally optimal policies. Exploration needs to be set carefully to avoid either over-exploring or under-exploring the state space. Note also that Boltzmann softmax performs remarkably well on this domain, outperforming sophisticated bayesian reinforcement learning algorithms. (Dearden et al., 1998)\nAs shown in Figure 10, SARSA with the epsilon-greedy policy performs poorly. In fact, in our experiment, the algorithm rarely was able to deliver all the passengers. However, SARSA with Boltzman softmax and SARSA with the maximum entropy mellowmax policy achieved significantly higher average reward. Maximum entropy mellowmax policy is no worse than Boltzmann softmax here."}, {"heading": "7.2. Lunar Lander Domain", "text": "In this section we evaluate maximum entropy mellowmax policy in the context of the policy gradient algorithms. Specifically, we represent policy by a deep neural network (we discuss the details of the network below). Usually the activation function of the last layer of the network is a softmax function, and typically Boltzmann softmax boltz\u03b2 is used. Alternatively, we use maximum entropy mellowmax policy, presented in section 6, by treating the input of the activation function as the Q\u0302 values.\nWe used the lunar lander domain, from OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016), as our benchmark. A screenshot of the domain is presented in Figure 11, and the code of the domain is publicly available. This domain has a continuous state space with 8 dimensions, namely x-y coordinates, x-y velocities, angle and angular velocities, and leg-touchdown sensors. There are 4 discrete actions to control 3 engines. The reward is +100 for a safe landing in the designated area, and -100 for a crash. There is a small shaping reward for approaching the landing area. Using the engines will also result in a negative reward. Episode finishes when the\nspacecraft crashes or lands. Solving the domain is defined as maintaining mean episode return higher than 200 in 100 consecutive episodes.\nThe policy is represented by a neural network with a hidden layer comprised of 16 units with RELU activation function, followed by a second layer with 16 units and softmax activation functions. We used REINFORCE to train the network. A batch episode size of 10 is used, as we had stability issues with a batch size of 1. We used Adam algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with \u03b1 = 0.005 and set the other parameters as suggested by the paper. We used Keras (Chollet, 2015) and Theano (Team et al., 2016) to implement the neural network.\nFor each softmax policy, we present in Figure 12 ,the learning curves for different values of their free parameter. We further plot average return over all 40000 episodes. Mellowmax is indeed less sensitive to the choice of its free parameter and outperforms Boltzmann."}, {"heading": "8. Related Work", "text": "Softmax operators play an important role in sequential decision-making algorithms.\nIn model-free reinforcement-learning, they can help strike a balance between exploration (mean) and exploitation (max). Decision rules based on epsilon-greedy and Boltzmann softmax, while very simple, often perform surprisingly well in practice, even outperforming more advanced exploration techniques (Kuleshov & Precup, 2014).\nWhen learning \u201con policy\u201d, exploration steps can (Rummery & Niranjan, 1994) and perhaps should (John, 1994) become part of the value-estimation process itself. On-policy algorithms like SARSA can be made to converge to optimal behavior in the limit when the exploration rate and the update operator is gradually moved toward max (Singh et al., 2000). Our use of softmax operators in learning updates reflects this point of view.\nAnalyses of the behavior of human subjects in choice experiments very frequently use softmax. Sometimes referred to in the literature as logit choice (Stahl & Wilson, 1994), it forms an important part of the most accurate predictor of human decisions in normal-form games (Wright & Leyton-Brown, 2010), quantal level-k reasoning (QLk). Softmax-based fixed points play a crucial role in this work. As such, mellowmax could potentially make a good replacement resulting in better behaved solutions.\nAlgorithms for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), the problem of inferring reward functions from observed behavior (Ng & Russell, 2000), frequently use a Boltzmann operator to avoid assigning zero probability to non-optimal actions and hence assessing an observed sequence as impossible. Such methods include Bayesian IRL (Ramachandran & Amir, 2007), natural gradient IRL (Neu & Szepesva\u0301ri, 2007), and maximum likelihood IRL (Babes et al., 2011). Given the recursive nature of value defined in these problems, mellowmax could be a more stable and efficient choice."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We proposed the mellowmax operator as an alternative for the Boltzmann operator. We showed that mellowmax has several desirable properties and that it works favorably in practice. Arguably, mellowmax could be used in place of Boltzmann throughout reinforcement-learning research.\nImportant future work is to expand the scope of investigation to the function approximation setting in which the state space or the action space is large and\nabstraction techniques are used. We expect mellowmax operator and its non-expansion property to behave more consistently than the Boltzmann operator when estimates of state\u2013action values can be arbitrarily inaccurate.\nAnother direction is to analyze the fixed point of planning, reinforcement-learning, and game-playing algorithms when using softmax and mellowmax operators. In particular, an interesting analysis could be one that bounds the suboptimality of fixed points found by value iteration under each operator.\nFinally, due to the convexity (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004) of mellowmax, it is compelling to use this operator in a gradient ascent algorithm in the context of sequential decision making. Inverse reinforcement-learning algorithms is a natural candidate given the popularity of softmax in these settings."}, {"heading": "10.
