INTRODUCTION\nThat\u2019s a very common situation for sociological, medical and educational tasks when initial data is given not in a numeric scale but rather in a rank (ordinal) scale [1-5]. This information (for the one-dimensional case) is given in the form of an ordered sequence of linguistic variables 1 2, ,..., ,..., ,i mx x x x 1 ... 1 1 ...j j j m        where jx is a linguistic variable and j is its corresponding rank.\nA typical example is a traditional (for Ukraine and some other ex-USSR countries) educational grading system like \"poor\", \"fair\", \"good\", \"excellent\". Let\u2019s note that a person in its daily activities is much more likely to use an ordinal scale rather than a numerical one.\nThe simplest approach for solving these clustering problems on an ordinal scale is based on replacement of linguistic variables with their ranks but this method is incorrect in most cases because it assumes equal distances between neighboring numerical ranks [6-12]. It is intuitively clear that a distance between \"poor\" and \"fair\" is much longer than a distance between \"fair\" and \"good\" while assessing students' knowledge. Many similar examples can be found in medicine.\nThat\u2019s a more natural approach that is based on fuzzification of input data and further usage of fuzzy clustering methods. Thus, an initial set of linguistic variables 1 2, ,..., ,...,i mx x x x is replaced with a set of membership functions 1 2( ), ( ),..., ( )mx x x   defined in the interval [0, 1] . This method was used in [13] where clustering (based on the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm [14]) was not performed for the initial data but for parameters describing corresponding membership functions, although a method for determining these parameters was not specified.\nThere\u2019s an approach that looks more natural. It's developed by R.K. Brouwer [15-21] and based on the frequency distribution analysis of the specific values\u2019 occurrence of linguistic variables. A limitation of this approach is an assumption about the Gaussian distribution of the initial data. This assumption is not usually met in many real-world applications.\nThe initial data for solving the task is a sample of observations which contains N n  dimensional feature vectors { (1), (2),..., ( ),..., ( )},X x x x k x N 1, 2,..., ,k N ( ) { ( )},jix k x k\n1,2,..., ; 1,2,...,i n j m  is a rank of a specific value of a linguistic variable in the i  th coordinate of the n dimensional space for the k  th object to be clustered.\nA result of this algorithm is partition of the initial dataset X into m classes (clusters) as well as calculation of a membership level ( )jw k k  th feature vector to the j  th cluster.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes a procedure of the initial data fuzzification. Section 3 describes. a fuzzy clustering method for ordinal data. Section 4 describes experimental results. Conclusions and future work are given in the final section."}, {"heading": "II. THE INITIAL DATA FUZZIFICATION", "text": "A fuzzification process for a sequence of rank linguistic variables may be considered by an example of the one-dimensional sample (1), (2),..., ( )x x x N where each observation ( )x k may be ascribed one of the j ranks, 1,2,...,j m .\nLet the value ( )x k (which corresponds to the j  th rank) be seen in the sample jN times.

Based on these cumulative frequencies, membership functions\u2019 ( )j x centers are formed\n(Fig.1). At the same time, it\u2019s convenient to use a recurrence relation to compute centers 1 10,5c f , 1 10,5( ),j j j jc c f f    2,3,...j m , and to set membership functions in the form\nFig.1.

Using a term of the   cut\n : ( )A x X x     , an area of influence for two neighboring ranks (shaded in Fig.2) can be introduced in the form of\n \n  1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1\n1\n[ , 0,5 ] : ( )\n1 0,5 ,\n[ 0,5 , ] : ( )\n1 0,5\nR R j j j j j j\nj\nj j\nL L j j j j j j\nj\nj j\nA x c c f x\nf c c\nA x c f c x\nf c c\n \n \n\n     \n\n\n                    \n(1)\nwhere L and R stand for the left and right sides of neighboring membership functions. If there\u2019s a hit of some observation in the area of influence of a particular rank, we can talk about crisp belonging to this rank.\nFig.2. The areas of influence for neighboring ranks."}, {"heading": "III. A FUZZY CLUSTERING METHOD FOR ORDINAL DATA", "text": "Since we have a multidimensional data sample of observations (vectors) to be clustered, the fuzzification procedure should be performed in every coordinate of the n dimensional feature space similarly to the previous example. nm membership functions are formed (they have centers ijc ) during this procedure like it\u2019s shown for a two-dimensional case (Fig.3). Here comes an object ( )x k to be clustered with coordinates\n2 1 4 2 ( ) ( ) . ( ) x k a x k x k e       \nAs one can see in Fig.3, membership functions 12 1 13 1 14 1( ), ( ), ( ),x x x   22 2 23 2 24 2( ), ( ), ( )x x x   work in this case in such a way that it\u2019s rather hard to make an immediate decision about belonging of\n( )x k to one of the classes \u00abPoor\u00bb, \u00abFair\u00bb, \u00abGood\u00bb and \u00abExcellent\u00bb (Fig.3). A process of fuzzy clustering for rank variables is carried out at the same example that is shown in Fig.4. After nm membership functions (in our example, 2 4 8  membership functions) have been formed, n  dimensional vectors (cluster centroids) 1 2( , ,..., ) , 1,2,...,Tj j j njc c c c j m  are taken into consideration (in our example, 1 11 12 2 21 22( , ) , ( , ) ,T Tc c c c c c  3 31 32 4 41 42( , ) , ( , )T Tc c c c c c  ) with their areas of influence which are described by ratios (1) (shaded areas in the picture). If an object gets into these regions, we can say that there\u2019s crisp membership of an object ( )x k to a specific cluster. We have an object\n( ) ( , )Tx k e a to be classified which is represented in a numerical form with coordinates 12c and 24c after fuzzification..\nThen distances ( ( ), ) || ( ) ||i id x k c x k c  between ( )x k and all centroids ic are calculated. Membership levels ( )jw k of a vector ( )x k to the j  th cluster should be defined according to the FCM procedure [22]\n2 2\n2 2\n1 1\n|| ( ) || ( ( ), ) ( )\n|| ( ) || ( ( ), )\nj j j m m\nl l l l\nx k c d x k c w k\nx k c d x k c\n \n \n \n  \n  . (2)\nA drawback of the estimate (2) is the fact that an object (except the case when ( )x k gets into an area of influence of a centroid) equally belongs to all the existing clusters which leads to loss of a physical sense in the rank scale. So, an object under consideration ( ) ( , )Tx k e a with a non-zero membership level may belong both to the \u00abExcellent\u00bb cluster and to the \u00abPoor\u00bb cluster. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nIt seems reasonable in this regard to rank all the distances ( ( ), )jd x k c (which have been\npreviously computed) in an ascending order and to choose the minimum distance min min ( ( ), )jd x k c\nand the one following it min ( ( ), )ld x k c . Then we can use the expression (2) with the only difference that we take into account only the two minimum distances. Finally, ( )x k belongs to two neighboring clusters with centroids jc and 1jc  (or 1jc  ) with some membership levels ( )jw k and\n1( )jw k (or 1( )jw k ).\nThus, the fuzzy clustering algorithm for multidimensional observations given in the ordinal scale is implemented as a sequence of steps: 1.

Since classes weren\u2019t initially given in the dataset, it\u2019s quite difficult to talk about a clustering accuracy of each method. Although analyzing the computed membership functions for some observations (Tables 1 and 2), it should be noticed that the proposed approach performs data processing in a more correct manner. It\u2019s clear that the\ndemonstrated observations (Tables 1 and 2) may belong to the \"Good\" and \"Excellent\" clusters with a certain membership level but there\u2019s no way for them to belong to the \u201cFair\u201d cluster. It\u2019s proven by the FCM and BFCM methods (Table 3).\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe task of fuzzy clustering ordinal data has been solved with the help of the proposed method.
