In this work, much of the focus is on the way that arguments are constructed from some set of components, expressed in some logic. At this point, perhaps the most widely studied system of structured argumentation is aspic`, which builds on what is now quite a lengthy tradition, a tradition which goes back at least as far as [10]. In addition to Pollock\u2019s work on oscar [9, 11], we can count the work of Loui [7], Krause et al. [6], Prakken and Sartor [13], Besnard and Hunter [2], Amgoud and Cayrol [1], Garc\u0301\u0131a and Simari [5] and Dung et al. [4] as being in the same lineage. aspic` [8, 12] is more recent, but very influential, providing a very general notion of argumentation that captures many of the structured systems which predate it. In all these systems, there is, often explicitly, a notion of an argument as a pair xc, \u2206y which relates the conclusion of the argument, c, and the set of statements \u2206 from which that conclusion is derived. The form of derivation, and what these \u201cstatements\u201d consist of, are two of the aspects of these systems which vary widely.\nOne difference between aspic` and other systems of structured argumentation is that many of the latter require that arguments be minimal in the sense that the set \u2206 in any argument xc, \u2206y has to be minimal. That is, \u2206 has to be the smallest set from which c can be derived. We can find this explicitly expressed, for example, in [1, 2, 5]. In contrast, like the assumption-based system from [4], aspic` does not explicitly require arguments to be minimal in this sense. Instead aspic` arguments satisfy a different form of minimality in which arguments cannot include premises or rules that are not used in the derivation of their conclusion. In recent work using aspic`[3], we discovered some cases in which the difference between these two forms of minimality was important, and so needed to investigate those differences in the context of aspic`. In this note we report our findings.\nNote that while the first form of minimality is stronger than the native minimality of aspic`, because there are aspic` arguments that are not minimal in this sense, this form of minimality is completely compatible with aspic`, and indeed with assumption-based argumentation (which shares the same mechanism for defining an argument). As we show, when the stronger form of minimality is required, we can simply invoke a definition for arguments in aspic` which does require this form of minimality."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "aspic ` is deliberately defined in a rather abstract way, as a system with a minimal set of features that can capture the notion of argumentation. This is done with the intention that it can be instantiated by a number of concrete systems that then inherit all of the properties of the more abstract system. aspic` starts from a logical language L with a notion of negation. A given instantiation will then be equipped with inference rules, and aspic` distinguishes two kinds of inference rules: strict rules and defeasible rules. Strict rules, denoted using \u00d1, are rules whose conclusions hold without exception. Defeasible rules, denoted \u00f1, are rules whose conclusions hold unless there is an exception.\nThe language and the set of rules are used to define an argumentation system:\nDefinition 1 (Argumentation System) An argumentation system is a tuple AS \u201c xL, ,R, ny where:\n\u2022 L is a logical language.\n\u2022 is a function from L to 2L , such that:\n\u2013 \u03d5 is a contrary of \u03c8 if \u03d5 P \u03c8, \u03c8 R \u03d5;\n\u2013 \u03d5 is a contradictory of \u03c8 if \u03d5 P \u03c8, \u03c8 P \u03d5;\n\u2013 each \u03d5 P L has at least one contradictory.\n\u2022 R \u201c RsYRd is a set of strict (Rs) and defeasible (Rd) inference rules of the form \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6n \u00d1 \u03c6 and \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6n \u00f1 \u03c6 respectively (where \u03c6i, \u03c6 are meta-variables ranging over wff in L), and RsXRd \u201c H.\n\u2022 n : Rd \u00de\u00d1 L is a naming convention for defeasible rules.\nThe function generalizes the usual symmetric notion of negation to allow non-symmetric conflict between elements of L. The contradictory of some \u03d5 P L is close to the usual notion of negation, and we denote that \u03d5 is a contradictory of \u03c8 by \u201c\u03d5 \u201c \u03c8\u201d. The naming convention for defeasible rules is necessary because aspic\n` allows for rules that deny the applicability of other rules. Giving rules names makes this easy to accomplish.\nAn argumentation system, as defined above, is just a language and some rules which can be applied to formulae in that language. To provide a framework in which reasoning can happen, we need to add information that is known, or believed, to be true. In aspic` this information makes up a knowledge base:\nDefinition 2 (Knowledge Base) A knowledge base in an argumentation system xL, ,R, ny is a set K \u010e L consisting of two disjoint subsets Kn and Kp.\nWe call Kn the axioms and Kp the ordinary premises. We make this distinction between the elements of the knowledge base for the same reason that we make the distinction between strict and defeasible rules. We are distinguishing between those elements \u2014 axioms and strict rules \u2014 which are definitely true and allow truth-preserving inferences to be made, and those elements \u2014 ordinary premises and defeasible rules \u2014 which can be disputed.\nCombining the notions of argumentation system and knowledge base gives us the notion of an argumentation theory:\nDefinition 3 (Argumentation Theory) An argumentation theory AT is a pair xAS,Ky of an argumentation system AS and a knowledge base K.\nWe are now nearly ready to define an argument. But first we need to introduce some notions which can be defined just understanding that an argument is made up of some subset of the knowledge base K, along with a sequence of rules, that lead to a conclusion. Given this, Premp\u00a8q returns all the premises, Concp\u00a8q returns the conclusion and TopRulep\u00a8q returns the last rule in the argument. Subp\u00a8q returns all the sub-arguments of a given argument, that is all the arguments that are contained in the given argument.\nDefinition 4 (Argument) An argument A from an argumentation theory AT \u201c xL, , Rules, ny,Ky is:\n1. \u03c6 if \u03c6 P K with: PrempAq \u201c t\u03c6u; ConcpAq \u201c t\u03c6u; SubpAq \u201c tAu; TopRulepAq \u201c undefined.\n2. A1, . . . , An \u00d1 \u03c6 if Ai, 1 \u010f i \u010f n, are arguments and there exists a strict rule of the form ConcpA1q, . . . , ConcpAnq \u00d1 \u03c6 in Rs.

A1, . . . , An \u00f1 \u03c6 if Ai, 1 \u010f i \u010f n, are arguments and there exists a defeasible rule of the form ConcpA1q, . . . , ConcpAnq \u00f1 \u03c6 in Rd.

From here on, we will use the symbol \u00f9 when we do not care about distinguishing whether an argument uses a strict rule \u00d1 or a defeasible rule \u00f1. Thus, if we are making a statement about an argument A \u201c rB \u00f9 as, then we are making a statement about both arguments A 1 \u201c rB\u00d1 as and A2 \u201c rB\u00f1 as. Similarly, when referring to a rule a \u00f9 b we are referring to either a strict rule a\u00d1 b or a defeasible rule a\u00f1 b, and in a context in which it does not matter whether the rule is strict or defeasible.\nThe above is a standard presentation of an argument in aspic`. In this report we wish to refer to an additional element of an argument, and to describe an argument in somewhat different way. In particular, we wish to refer to RulespAq, which identifies all the strict or defeasible rules used in the argument A.\nDefinition 5 (Argument Rules) Let AT \u201c xAS,Ky be an argumentation theory and A P ApAT q. We define the set of rules of A as follows:\nRulespAq \u201c\n$\n\u2019 &\n\u2019 %\nH A P K\ntTopRulepAqu Y \u0164n\ni\u201c1 RulespAiq A \u201c A1, . . . , An \u00f9 ConcpAq\nWe can then describe an argument A as a triple:\npG,R, pq\nwhere G \u201c PrempAq are the grounds on which A is based, R \u201c RulespAq is the set of rules that are used to construct A from G, and p \u201c ConcpAq is the conclusion of A.\nExample 1 Consider that we have an argumentation system AS1 \u201c xL1, ,R1, ny, where L1 \u201c tp, q, r, s, t, u, v, p, q, r, s, t, u, vu, R1 \u201c tp, q \u00f9 r; t, u \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s;u \u00f9 vu. By adding the knowledge base K1 \u201c tp, q, t, uu we obtain the argumentation theory AT1 \u201c xAS1,K1y, from which we can construct the following arguments:\nA1 \u201c rps; A2 \u201c rqs; A3 \u201c rA1, A2 \u00f9 rs; A \u201c rA3 \u00f9 ss; B1 \u201c rts; B2 \u201c rus; B3 \u201c rB1, B2 \u00f9 rs; B \u201c rB3 \u00f9 ss\nsuch that A1 \u201c ptpu,H, pq, A2 \u201c ptqu,H, qq, A3 \u201c ptp, qu, tp, q \u00f9 ru, rq, A \u201c ptp, qu, tp, q \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 su, sq, B1 \u201c pttu,H, tq, B2 \u201c ptuu,H, uq, B3 \u201c ptt, uu, tt, u \u00f9 ru, rq and B \u201c ptt, uu, tt, u \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 su, sq."}, {"heading": "3 Minimality", "text": "Now, as mentioned above, unlike some definitions of arguments in the literature\u2014for example [1, 5]\u2014 Definition 4 does not mention the minimality of the grounds or the set of rules. This does not mean that aspic\n` arguments are not, in some sense, minimal, as we we will now show. The following example illustrates the fact that any element (proposition or rule) in the grounds and rules\nof an argument needs to be used in the derivation of the conclusion of that argument:\nExample 2 Given the argumentation theory from Example 1, the structure\nC \u201c ptp, q, t, uu, tp, q \u00f9 r; t, u \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 su, sq\nis not an argument. In particular, C is not an argument because the third clause of Definition 4 only justifies adding the rules and grounds of one argument for each premise of the rule that is the subject of the clause. Thus, it allows p, q \u00f9 r to be added to an argument with conclusion r, or it allows t, u \u00f9 r to be added, but it does not permit both to be added. Similarly,\nD \u201c ptp, qu, tp, q \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s;u \u00f9 vu, sq E \u201c ptt, uu, tt, u \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s;u \u00f9 vu, sq\nare not arguments because Definition 4 does not allow rules that are not used in the derivation of the conclusion of an argument to be part of the set of rules of that argument. Finally, neither of\nF \u201c ptp, q, t, uu, tp, q \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 su, sq G \u201c ptp, q, t, uu, tt, u \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 su, sq\nare arguments, because Definition 4 does not allow the addition of propositions to the grounds of an argument if they do not correspond to premises of a rule in the argument.\nThus, as the preceding example shows, an argument A \u201c pG,R, pq cannot contain any elements in G or R that are not used in the derivation of p, and so Definition 4 implies that arguments are minimal in the sense that they do not contain any extraneous propositions or rules. This intuition is also pointed out by the authors in [8], and we formalize it in the following proposition:\nProposition 1 Let AT \u201c xAS,Ky be an argumentation theory and A P ApATq. It holds that either:\n(a) A \u201c ptpu,H, pq; or\n(b) A \u201c pG,R, pq and\ni. for every g P G: there exists A 1 P SubpAq such that A 1 \u201c ptgu,H, gq and there exists r P R such that r \u201c p1, . . . , g, . . . , pn \u00f9 p 1; and\nii. for every r 1 P R such that r 1 \u201c p1, . . . , pm \u00f9 p2: there exists A2 P SubpAq such that A2 \u201c pG2, R2 Y tr 1u, p2q.\nProof: Definition 4 includes three clauses that define when A \u201c pG,R, pq is an argument. In the first clause, the base case of the recursive definition, p P K, R is empty and G \u201c tpu, satisfying case (a).\nThe rest of this proof concerns case (b). Now, the second and third clauses of Definition 4, which define the recursive step of the definition, tells us that pG,R, pq is an argument if there exists a rule r P R such that r \u201c p1, . . . , pn \u00f9 p and for each pi p1 \u010f i \u010f nq there exists an argument Ai P ApAT q such that ConcpAiq \u201c pi. In other words, for every premise pi of the rule r there is a sub-argument Ai of A whose conclusion is that premise. Unwinding each of those sub-arguments in turn, they are either of the form ptpiu,H, piq, or can be deconstructed into a rule with sub-arguments for each premise, where that rule is in R. In the first of these cases, the first clause of Definition 4 tells us that pi P G, and so case (b.i) holds. From the second of these cases we can infer that for every rule p1, . . . , pm \u00f9 p\n2 P R, there is a sub-argument pG2, R2 Y tp1, . . . , pm \u00f9 p2u, p2q of A, and case (b.ii) is proved. l\nIn other words, given an argument A \u201c pG,R, pq, Proposition 1 states that every element of the grounds G and the rules R is part of the derivation of p. However, as the following example shows, Definition 4 does not imply that for any argument pG,R, pq there is no argument pG 1, R 1, pq such that G 1 \u0102 G and R 1 \u0102 R:\nExample 3 Consider that we have an argumentation system AS1 \u201c xL, ,R1, ny, where L \u201c tp, q, r, s, t, p, q, r, s, tu and R1 \u201c tp, q \u00f9 s; s \u00f9 q;q, r \u00f9 tu. By adding the knowledge base K1 \u201c tp, q, ru we obtain the argumentation theory AT1 \u201c xAS1,K1y, from which we can construct the following arguments:\nA1 \u201c rps;A2 \u201c rqs;A3 \u201c rA1, A2 \u00f9 ss;A4 \u201c rA3 \u00f9 qs;A5 \u201c rrs;A \u201c rA4, A5 \u00f9 ts; B \u201c rA2, A5 \u00f9 ts\nsuch that A \u201c ptp, q, ru, tp, q \u00f9 s; s \u00f9 q;q, r \u00f9 tu, tq and B \u201c ptq, ru, tq, r \u00f9 tu, tq. Here, it is clear that the grounds and rules of B are a subset of those of A.\nConsider now the set of rules R2 \u201c tp, q \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s; s \u00f9 t; t \u00f9 ru. We can obtain a new argumentation system AS2 \u201c xL, ,R2, ny and combine it with the knowledge base K1 to obtain the argumentation theory AT2 \u201c xAS2,K1y, from which we can construct the arguments:\nC1 \u201c rps;C2 \u201c rqs;C3 \u201c rC1, C2 \u00f9 rs;C4 \u201c rC3 \u00f9 ss;C5 \u201c rC4 \u00f9 ts;C \u201c rC5 \u00f9 rs; D \u201c C3 \u201c rC1, C2 \u00f9 rs\nHere, C \u201c ptp, qu, tp, q \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s; s \u00f9 t; t \u00f9 ru, rq and D \u201c ptp, qu, tp, q \u00f9 ruq and thus, RulespDq is a subset of RulespCq.\nFinally, if we consider a set of rules R3 \u201c tp \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s;q \u00f9 r; r, s \u00f9 tu and a knowledge base K3 \u201c tp, qu we can define an argumentation system AS3 \u201c xL, ,R3, ny and an argumentation theory AT3 \u201c xAS3,K3y, from which we obtain:\nE1 \u201c rps;E2 \u201c rE1 \u00f9 rs;E3 \u201c rE2 \u00f9 ss;E4 \u201c rqs;E5 \u201c rE4 \u00f9 rs;E \u201c rE5, E3 \u00f9 ts; F \u201c rE2, E3 \u00f9 ts\nIn this case, E \u201c ptp, qu, tp \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s;q \u00f9 r; r, s \u00f9 tu, tq and F \u201c ptpu, tp \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s; r, s \u00f9 tu, tq. As a result, the grounds and rules of F are a subset of those of E.\nAt first sight, this seems a bit contradictory. Example 2 and Proposition 1 show that arguments only contain elements that are used in the derivation of their conclusion, yet Example 3 shows that elements can be removed from the grounds or the rules of an argument, and what remains is still an argument. There is, however, no contradiction. Rather, there are two ways in which this phnomenon might arise. The first is illustrated by the first two cases in Example 3. Here we have arguments that are circular1 \u2014 if you follow the chain of reasoning from premises to conclusion in A in the above example, we start with q, then derive q, then use q to derive the final conclusion; similarly, when considering C, we start with p and q to derive r, then derive s and t to derive (again) r. In B and D these loops are removed to give us more compact arguments with the same conclusions. The second way in which this phenomenon might arise is illustrated by the third case in Example 3, where we have arguments that are redundant. Here the cause is the fact that the set of rules provides two ways to derive r, one that relies on p and another that relies on q, and r appears twice in the derivation of t, once to produce s, and once when the rule r, s \u00f9 t is applied. E, the redundant argument, uses both of the rules for deriving r while F uses just one of them, again providing a more compact derivation.\nFurthermore, as shown by the following example, circularity in arguments may lead to having two distinct arguments A and B such that their descriptions pG,R, pq coincide. Hence, while we can extract a unique description pG,R, pq from a given aspic` argument A, the reverse is not true.2\n1We use the term \u201ccircular\u201d to reflect the idea of circular reasoning [15] and \u201cbegging the question\u201d [14]. 2This is a version of the issue pointed out by [4, p119], that any inference-based description of an argument allows multiple arguments to be described in the same way. In fact what we have here is a stronger version of the problem, because [4] pointed out the problem for arguments which, in our terms, were described just by their grounds and conclusion. What we have here is the problem arising even when we state the inference rules as well. This issue the is converse of the problem that describing arguments by their entire structure, as aspic` and the assumption-based argumentation of [4] do, allows for redundant elements in the arguments, as we have just shown.\nExample 4 Consider that we have an argumentation system AS \u201c xL, ,R, ny, where L \u201c ta, b, c, a, b, cu and R \u201c ta \u00f9 c; c \u00f9 b;b \u00f9 au. We then add the knowledge base K \u201c tau to get the argumentation theory AT \u201c xAS,Ky. From this we can construct the following arguments:\nA1 \u201c ras; A2 \u201c rA1 \u00f9 cs; A3 \u201c rA2 \u00f9 bs; A \u201c rA3 \u00f9 as; B1 \u201c rA \u00f9 cs; B2 \u201c rB1 \u00f9 bs; B \u201c rB2 \u00f9 as\nHere, both arguments A and B are described by the triple pG,R, aq, where G \u201c PrempAq \u201c PrempBq \u201c tau, R \u201c RulespAq \u201c RulespBq \u201c R and a \u201c ConcpAq \u201c ConcpBq.\nGiven the preceding analysis we can note that, even though the characterization of aspic`arguments accounts for some form of minimality (see [8]), it allows for circular and redundant arguments. These notions of circularity and redundancy are formalized next.\nDefinition 6 Let AT be an argumentation theory and A P ApAT q. We say that A is a circular argument if DA1, A2 P SubpAq such that A1 \u2030 A2, ConcpA1q \u201c ConcpA2q and A1 P SubpA2q.\nNote that the usual definition of a circular argument in the literature [14, 15] involves starting with some premise and then inferring that premise \u2014 a typical pattern is \u201cAssume a, then a is true\u201d. What we define here as circular is more general.\nExample 5 Considering Example 3 in the light of Definition 6 and looking at A, the two sub-arguments that define its circularity are A1 \u201c ptqu,H, qq and A4 \u201c ptp, qu, tp, q \u00f9 s, s \u00f9 qu, qq. Then, if we consider argument C, the two sub-arguments that define its circularity are C3 \u201c ptp, qu, tp, q \u00f9 ru, rq and C \u201c ptp, qu, tp, q \u00f9 r, r \u00f9 s, s \u00f9 t, t \u00f9 ru, rq. Here, A follows the classic form of a circular argument. In contrast, C illustrates a form of circularity not related to the premises of the argument.\nNext, we formalize the notion of redundancy:\nDefinition 7 Let AT be an argumentation theory and A P ApATq. We say that A is a redundant argument if DA1, A2 P SubpAq such that A1 \u2030 A2, ConcpA1q \u201c ConcpA2q, A1 R SubpA2q and A2 R SubpA1q.\nExample 6 Considering Example 3 in the light of Definition 7, the two sub-arguments that define the redundancy of E are E2 \u201c ptpu, tp \u00f9 ru, rq and E5 \u201c ptqu, tq \u00f9 ru, rq.\nWe say that arguments that are non-circular and non-redundant are regular arguments since they are the kinds of argument that one encounters most often in the literature. Clearly this is the same as saying:\nDefinition 8 Let AT be an argumentation theory and A P ApATq. We say that A is regular if EA1, A2 P SubpAq such that A1 \u2030 A2 and ConcpA1q \u201c ConcpA2q.\nNow, to tie this back to the other notion of minimality, that of a minimal set of information from which a conclusion is derived, we need a notion of inference that works for aspic`. We start with a notion of closure. Given an argumentation theory, we can define the closure of a set of propositions in the knowledge base under a set of rules of the theory.\nDefinition 9 Let AT \u201c xAS,Ky be an argumentation theory, where AS is the argumentation system AS \u201c xL, ,R, ny. We define the closure of a set of propositions P \u010e K under a set of rules R \u010e R as ClpPqR, where:\n1. P \u010e ClpPqR;\n2. if p1, . . . , pn P ClpPqR and p1, . . . , pn \u00f9 p P R, then p P ClpPqR; and\n3. ES \u0102 ClpPq such that S satisfies the previous conditions.\nBased on the notion of closure, we can define a notion of inference from a set of propositions and rules of an argumentation theory.\nDefinition 10 Let AT \u201c xAS,Ky be an argumentation theory, where AS is the argumentation system AS \u201c xL, ,R, ny. Given a set of propositions P \u010e K, a set of rules R \u010e R and a proposition p P K, we say that p is inferred from P and R, noted as P $R p, if p P ClpPqR.\nNow, with this notion of inference, we can characterize minimal arguments. These arguments are such that they have minimal (with respect to \u010e) sets of grounds and rules that allow to infer their conclusion.\nDefinition 11 Let AT \u201c xAS,Ky be an argumentation theory and A P ApATq. We say that A \u201c pG,R, pq is a minimal argument if EG 1 \u0102 G such that G 1 $R p and ER 1 \u0102 R such that G $R 1 p.\nThe following example illustrates the first condition in Definition 11.\nExample 7 Let AT \u201c xAS,Ky be an argumentation theory, where AS \u201c xL, ,R, ny, R \u201c td \u00f9 b;b \u00f9 c; b, c \u00f9 au and K \u201c tb, du. From AT we can construct the following arguments:\nA1 \u201c rds;A2 \u201c rA1 \u00f9 bs;A3 \u201c rA2 \u00f9 cs;A4 \u201c rbs;A \u201c rA4, A3 \u00f9 as; B \u201c rA2, A3 \u00f9 as; A5 \u201c rA4 \u00f9 cs;C \u201c rA4, A5 \u00f9 as\nHere, A \u201c pG,R, aq, with G \u201c tb, du and R \u201c R. In this case, A is not minimal since DG 1 \u0102 G, with G 1 \u201c tdu, such that G 1 $R a; moreover, B \u201c pG 1, R, aq. On the other hand, argument C is represented by the triple pG2, R 1, aq, with G2 \u201c tbu and R 1 \u201c tb \u00f9 c;b, c \u00f9 au. In particular, argument C is minimal. Furthermore, B is also minimal since, even though R 1 \u0102 R, it is not the case that G 1 $R 1 a.\nIt should be noted that, since the notion of minimality characterized in Definition 11 explicitly accounts for the set of grounds of the arguments, this notion of minimality is different from those used in structured argumentation systems such as DeLP [5]. Arguments in DeLP do not include the grounds: they are specified by a pair pc, \u2206q, where \u2206 is the set of rules used to derive the conclusion c. Then, the notion minimality in DeLP regards only the set of rules of the arguments. As a result, if we consider the arguments given in Example 7, argument B would not be minimal in DeLP.\nTo illustrate the second condition of Definition 11, let us consider the situation depicted in Example 4. There we have arguments A and B, which are both described by the triple pG,R, aq, with G \u201c tau and R \u201c ta \u00f9 c; c \u00f9 b;b \u00f9 au. Also, there is argument A1 \u201c pG 1,H, aq, with G 1 \u201c tau. As a result, DG 1 \u0102 G such that G 1 $R a and therefore, arguments A and B are not minimal, in contrast with A1.\nGiven the characterization of regular and minimal arguments, the following proposition shows that these notions are equivalent.\nProposition 2 Let AT \u201c xAS,Ky be an argumentation theory and A \u201c pG,R, pq P ApAT q. A is a regular argument iff A is a minimal argument.\nProof: The proof follows the same form as that of Proposition 1, being based around the three clauses of Definition 4.\nLet us start with the if part. In the first clause of Definition 4, p is a proposition in K, R is empty, and G contains just p. Clearly, in this case there is no R 1 \u0102 R, or G 1 \u0102 G such that G 1 $R p or G $R 1 p, so A is minimal. It is also regular. The second and third clauses in Definition 4 define the recursive case. Here, A \u201c pG,R, pq is an argument if p is the conclusion of a rule, let us call it r and there is an argument in ApAT q for each of the premises of r. G is then the union of the grounds of all the arguments with conclusions that are premises of r, we will call this set of arguments Args, and R is the union of all the rules for Args, call them Rs, plus r. If all the arguments in Args are minimal, then A will be minimal, so long as piq adding r does not introduce any non-minimality, and piiq the union of the grounds and the rules of the arguments in Args do not introduce any non-minimality. Let us consider case piq. For the addition of r to introduce non-minimality, it must be the case that pG,Rs, pq is an argument. In this case, pG,Rs, pq will be a sub-argument of A and thus, by Definition 6 A is circular, contradicting the hypothesis that it is a regular argument. Let us now consider case piiq. Here, in order for A not to be minimal, there have\nto be minimal arguments pG1, R1, p1q, . . . , pGn, Rn, pnq in Args such that p1, . . . , pn are the premises in r and A \u201c p\n\u0164n i\u201c1Gi, \u0164n i\u201c1 Ri Y tru, pq is not minimal. Because we are taking the unions, no duplication can\nbe introduced. Since G1, . . . , Gn are just sets of propositions, their union cannot be the cause of any nonminimality, and we know from case piq that any non-minimality is not due to r. So if any non-minimality is introduced, it is in\n\u0164n i\u201c1 Ri. Since Proposition 1 tells us that every rule in Ri must be used in deriving pi,\nthe only way that \u0164n\ni\u201c1 Ri can make A non-minimal is if there is some rule in Rj which allows the derivation of the same conclusion as a rule in Rk pwith 1 \u010f j, k \u010f n, and j \u2030 k). If this is the case, A \u201c pG,R, pq would have two distinct sub-arguments with the same conclusion, where one is not a sub-argument of the other, and hence, by Definition 7 be redundant, contradicting the hypothesis that A is regular.\nLet us now address the only if part. In the first clause of Definition 4, p is a proposition in K, R is empty, and G contains just p. Clearly, in this case A is regular since A is the only sub-argument of A; thus, there exist no distinct sub-arguments of A with the same conclusion. A is also minimal. The second and third clauses in Definition 4 define the recursive case. Here, A \u201c pG,R, pq is an argument if p is the conclusion of a rule, let us call it r and there is an argument in ApATq for each of the premises of r. G is then the union of the grounds of all the arguments with conclusions that are premises of r, and R is the union of all the rules for those arguments, plus r. Since by hypothesis A \u201c pG,R, pq is minimal, it must be the case that EG 1 \u0102 G such that G 1 $R p and ER 1 \u0102 R such that G $R 1 p. Suppose by contradiction that A is not regular. Hence, there should exist two distinct sub-arguments A1 \u201c pG1, R1, p 1q and A2 \u201c pG2, R2, p 1q of A such that G1 \u2030 G2, R1 \u2030 R2 or both. However, this would imply that DG 1 \u0102 G pwith G 1 \u201c pGzG1q Y G2 or G 1 \u201c pGzG2qYG1q or DR 1 \u0102 R pwith R 1 \u201c pRzR1qYR2 or R 1 \u201c pRzR2qYR1q such that G 1 $R p and ER 1 \u0102 R such that G $R 1 p, contradicting the hypothesis that A is minimal. l\nThe following example illustrates the relationship between regular and minimal arguments.\nExample 8 Let us consider the arguments from Example 7, where it was shown that B and C are minimal arguments, whereas A is not. Here, we have that B is also regular, since it has no pair of sub-arguments with the same conclusion. Specifically, SubpBq \u201c tB,A2, A3, A1u, and ConcpBq \u201c a, ConcpA2q \u201c b, ConcpA3q \u201c c, ConcpA1q \u201c d. Similarly, C is also regular since SubpCq \u201c tC,A4, A5u, where ConcpCq \u201c a, ConcpA4q \u201c b and ConcpA5q \u201c c. In contrast, if we consider argument A, which was shown to be non-minimal in Example 7, we have SubpAq \u201c tA,A4, A3, A2, A1u where, in particular, ConcpA4q \u201c b and ConcpA2q \u201c b; therefore, A is not a regular argument.\nOn the other hand, if we consider the arguments from Example 3, it was shown in Examples 5 and 6 that A, C and E are not regular arguments (the first two by being circular and the last one by being redundant). Then, if we look at the minimality of these arguments, we have that A \u201c pGa, Ra, tq, with Ga \u201c tp, q, ru, Ra \u201c tp, q \u00f9 s; s \u00f9 q;q, r \u00f9 tu, and DG 1a \u201c tru, DR 1 a \u201c tr \u00f9 tu such that G 1\na $Ra t and Ga $R 1a t; hence, A is not a minimal argument. In the case of C \u201c pGc, Rc, rq, with Gc \u201c tp, qu and Rc \u201c tp, q \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s; s \u00f9 t; t \u00f9 ru, we have that DR 1c \u201c tp, q \u00f9 ru such that Gc $R 1c r and therefore, C is not minimal. Finally, given E \u201c pGe, Re, tq, with Ge \u201c tp, qu and Re \u201c tp \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s;q \u00f9 r; r, s \u00f9 tu, it is the case that DG 1e \u201c tpu, DG 2 e \u201c tqu, DR 1 e \u201c tp \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s; r, s \u00f9 tu, DR 2\ne \u201c tr \u00f9 s;q \u00f9 r; r, s \u00f9 tu such that G 1e $Re t, G 2 e $Re t, Ge $R 1e t and Ge $R2e t; thus, E is not a minimal argument.\nLet us consider another example regarding minimal and non-minimal arguments.\nExample 9 Consider that we have an argumentation system AS9 \u201c xL9, ,R9, ny, where L9 \u201c tp, q, r, p, q, ru and R9 \u201c tp \u00f9 q;q \u00f9 ru. By adding the knowledge base K9 \u201c tp, qu we obtain the argumentation theory AT9 \u201c xAS9,K9y, from which we can construct the following arguments:\nH1 \u201c rps; H2 \u201c rH1 \u00f9 qs; H \u201c rH2 \u00f9 rs; I1 \u201c rqs; I \u201c rI1 \u00f9 rs\nsuch that H \u201c ptpu, tp \u00f9 q;q \u00f9 ru, rq and I \u201c ptqu, tq \u00f9 ru, rq.\nEven though arguments H and I in Example 9 have the same conclusion and use the same rule to draw that conclusion, they are both minimal. This is because an argument is minimal according to Definition 11 if\nthere is no argument for the same conclusion with a smaller set of both premises (grounds) and rules. Thus it is possible to have two minimal arguments for the same conclusion, one of which uses a subset of the rules that the other does, so long as the premises are disjoint. Similarly, we could have two minimal arguments for the same conclusion, one of which uses a subset of the premises that the other does, so long as the rules are disjoint.\nOn the other hand, the situation depicted in Example 9 relates to the one involving arguments C3 \u201c ptp, qu, tp, q \u00f9 ru, rq and C \u201c ptp, qu, tp, q \u00f9 r; r \u00f9 s; s \u00f9 t; t \u00f9 ru, rq in Example 3. However, even though C3 and C have the same conclusion, differently from H and I, they are such that one is a sub-argument of the other (specifically, C3 is a sub-argument of C) and, as a result, C is not regular nor minimal.\nFinally, it should be noted that, since aspic` arguments are not required to be minimal in the sense of Definition 11, it can be the case that two different arguments A and B have the same description as a triple pG,R, pq, as occurred in Example 4. However, as shown by the following proposition, that cannot be the case when considering minimal arguments.\nProposition 3 Let AT \u201c xAS,Ky be an argumentation theory and A \u201c pG,R, pq P ApAT q. If A is a minimal argument, then EB P ApTq such that B \u2030 A and B \u201c pG,R, pq.\nProof: Suppose that A \u201c pG,R, pq is a minimal argument and DB P ApTq such that B \u2030 A and B \u201c pG,R, pq. By Proposition 1, every element in the grounds G and every rule in R is used in the derivation of A\u2019s and B\u2019s conclusion p. Furthermore, since by hypothesis A is minimal, by Definition 11 it is the case that EG 1 \u0102 G, ER 1 \u0102 R such that G 1 $R p or G $R 1 p. If B \u2030 A, then it must be the case that the difference between them is on the number of times they use the rules in R. Since by hypothesis A is minimal, there must be a rule r \u201c c1, . . . , cn \u00f9 c P R that is used more times in B than in A. Now consider the derivation of A and B. From what we have said so far, these must be largely the same, so we can think of them starting from the same set of premises and applying rules, one by one. Thinking of the two arguments like this, side by side, so to speak, since B uses some r more than A, then at some stage B uses the rule r to derive c, whereas r is not used in A at that point. Hence, since c is needed at that point to derive A\u2019s conclusion p, there must be an alternative derivation for c in A, which does not require the use of r. However, this would imply that there exists a rule r 1 P R such that r 1 \u201c c 11, . . . , c 1\nm \u00f9 c or c P G, contradicting the hypothesis that A is minimal. As a result, if A is a minimal argument, then EB P ApTq such that B \u2030 A and B \u201c pG,R, pq. l\nWe end by noting that even though H and I, above, are both minimal in the sense of Definition 11, I is in some sense \u201cmore minimal\u201d than G since the sets of premises of both arguments are the same size, while I has a smaller set of rules. This suggests that further forms of minimality may be worth investigating."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this report we have studied the notion of minimality of arguments in the context of aspic`. We have considered two forms of minimality. The former corresponds to the native minimality of aspic`, which implies that arguments do not include irrelevant grounds or rules. We have noted that, under the native form of minimality, redundant and circular arguments may be obtained. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with circular and redundant arguments, in some cases it may be helpful to work with arguments that satisfy a stronger form of minimality. A stronger form of minimality is satisfied by what we have identified as regular arguments, since these are the arguments that one encounters most often in the literature of argumentation. Specifically, regular arguments make use of a minimal set of grounds and rules when deriving their conclusion. It should be noted that an argument A satisfying the stronger form of minimality uses the same grounds and rules for deriving a proposition c at every step in which c is required in the derivation of A\u2019s conclusion. Furthermore, we have shown that regular arguments, satisfying the stronger form of minimality, can be unequivocally described by a triple pG,R, pq, distinguishing their grounds, rules and conclusion. In contrast, that is not the case for arguments complying only with aspic`\u2019s native form of\nminimality. Finally, in the future we are interested in studying the relationship between the strong form of minimality characterized here and that considered in other structured argumentation systems."}], "references": [{"title": "A reasoning model based on the production of acceptable arguments", "author": ["L.
