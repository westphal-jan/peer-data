Each edge (s, t) \u2208 E between channel s and person t is weighted with a probability pst that, e.g., an advertisement on radio station s will influence person t to buy some product. The budget y(s) controls how many independent attempts are made via the channel s to influence the people in T . The probability that a customer t is influenced when the advertising budget is y is\nIt(y) = 1\u2212 \u220f\n(s,t)\u2208E [1\u2212 pst]y(s), (1)\nand hence the expected number of influenced people is I(y) = \u2211\nt\u2208T It(y). We write I(y; p) = I(y) to make the dependence on the probabilities pst explicit. The total budget y must remain within some feasible set Y which may encode e.g. a total budget limit \u2211 s\u2208S y(s) \u2264 C. We allow the budgets y to be continuous, as in [Bian et al., 2017].\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n08 79\n1v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n3 Ju\nn 20\nSince its introduction by Alon et al. [2012], several works have extended the formulation of Budget Allocation and provided algorithms Bian et al. [2017]; Hatano et al. [2015]; Maehara et al. [2015]; Soma et al. [2014]; Soma & Yoshida [2015]. Budget Allocation may also be viewed as influence maximization on a bipartite graph, where information spreads as in the Independent Cascade model. For integer y, Budget Allocation and Influence Maximization are NP-hard. Yet, constant-factor approximations are possible, and build on the fact that the influence function is submodular in the binary case, and DR-submodular in the integer case [Soma et al., 2014; Hatano et al., 2015]. If y is continuous, the problem is a concave maximization problem.\nThe formulation of Budget Allocation assumes that the transmission probabilities are known exactly. But this is rarely true in practice. Typically, the probabilities pst, and possibly the graph itself, must be inferred from observations [Gomez Rodriguez et al., 2010; Du et al., 2013; Narasimhan et al., 2015; Du et al., 2014; Netrapalli & Sanghavi, 2012]. In Section 4 we will see that a misspecification or point estimate of parameters pst can lead to much reduced outcomes. A more realistic assumption is to know confidence intervals for the pst. Realizing this severe deficiency, recent work studied robust versions of Influence Maximization, where a budget y must be chosen that maximizes the worst-case approximation ratio over a set of possible influence functions [He & Kempe, 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Lowalekar et al., 2016]. The resulting optimization problem is hard but admits bicriteria approximations.\nIn this work, we revisit Budget Allocation under uncertainty from the perspective of robust optimization [Bertsimas et al., 2011; Ben-Tal et al., 2009]. We maximize the worst-case influence \u2013 not approximation ratio \u2013 for p in a confidence set centered around the \u201cbest guess\u201d (e.g., posterior mean). This avoids pitfalls of the approximation ratio formulation (which can be misled to return poor worst-case budgets, as demonstrated in Appendix A), while also allowing us to formulate the problem as a max-min game:\nmax y\u2208Y min p\u2208P\nI(y; p), (2)\nwhere an \u201cadversary\u201d can arbitrarily manipulate p within the confidence set P. With p fixed, I(y; p) is concave in y. However, the influence function I(y; p) is not convex, and not even quasiconvex, in the adversary\u2019s variables pst.\nThe new, key insight we exploit in this work is that I(y; p) has the property of continuous submodularity in p \u2013 in contrast to previously exploited submodular maximization in y \u2013 and can hence be minimized by generalizing techniques from discrete submodular optimization Bach [2015]. The techniques in [Bach, 2015], however, are restricted to box constraints, and do not directly apply to our confidence sets. In fact, general constrained submodular minimization is hard [Svitkina & Fleischer, 2011; Goel et al., 2009; Iwata & Nagano, 2009]. We make the following contributions:\n1. We present an algorithm with optimality bounds for Robust Budget Allocation in the nonconvex adversarial scenario (2).\n2. We provide the first results for continuous submodular minimization with box constraints and one more \u201cnice\u201d constraint, and conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to return a global optimum."}, {"heading": "1.1 Background and Related Work", "text": "We begin with some background material and, along the way, discuss related work."}, {"heading": "1.1.1 Submodularity over the integer lattice and continuous domains", "text": "Submodularity is perhaps best known as a property of set functions. A function F : 2V \u2192 R defined on subsets S \u2286 V of a ground set V is submodular if for all sets S, T \u2286 V , it holds that F (S) + F (T ) \u2265 F (S \u2229 T ) + F (S \u222a T ). A similar definition extends to functions defined over a distributive lattice L, e.g. the integer lattice. Such a function f is submodular if for all x, y \u2208 L, it holds that\nf(x) + f(y) \u2265 f(x \u2228 y) + f(x \u2227 y). (3)\nFor the integer lattice and vectors x, y, x \u2228 y denotes the coordinate-wise maximum and x \u2227 y the coordinate-wise minimum. Submodularity has also been considered on continuous domains X \u2282 Rd, where, if f is also twice-differentiable, the property of submodularity means that all off-diagonal entries of the the Hessian are nonpositive, i.e., \u2202f(x)\u2202xi\u2202xj \u2264 0 for all i 6= j [Topkis, 1978, Theorem 3.2]. These functions may be convex, concave, or neither.\nSubmodular functions on lattices can be minimized by a reduction to set functions, more precisely, ring families Birkhoff [1937]. Combinatorial algorithms for submodular optimization on lattices are discussed in [Khachaturov et al., 2012]. More recently, Bach [2015] extended results based on the convex Lova\u0301sz extension, by building on connections to optimal transport. The subclass of L\\-convex functions admits strongly polynomial time minimization [Murota, 2003; Kolmogorov & Shioura, 2009; Murota & Shioura, 2014], but does not apply in our setting.\nSimilarly, results for submodular maximization extend to integer lattices, e.g. [Gottschalk & Peis, 2015]. Stronger results are possible if the submodular function also satisfies diminishing returns: for all x \u2264 y (coordinate-wise) and i such that y+ ei \u2208 X , it holds that f(x+ ei)\u2212 f(x) \u2265 f(y + ei) \u2212 f(y). For such DR-submodular functions, many approximation results for the set function case extend [Bian et al., 2017; Soma & Yoshida, 2015; Soma et al., 2014]. In particular, Ene & Nguyen [2016] show a generic reduction to set function optimization that they apply to maximization. In fact, it also applies to minimization:\nProposition 1.1. A DR-submodular function f defined on \u220fn i=1[ki] can be minimized in strongly polynomial time O(n4 log4 k \u00b7 log2(n log k) \u00b7EO+n4 log4 k \u00b7 logO(1)(n log k)), where k = maxi ki and EO is the time complexity of evaluating f . Here, [ki] = {0, 1, . . . , ki \u2212 1}.\nProof. The function f can be reduced to a submodular set function g : 2V \u2192 R via [Ene & Nguyen, 2016], where |V | = O(n log k). The function g can be evaluated via mapping from 2V to the domain of f , and then evaluating f , in time O(n log k \u00b7EO). We can directly substitute these complexities into the runtime bound from [Lee et al., 2015].\nIn particular, the time complexity is logarithmic in k. For general lattice submodular functions, this is not possible without further assumptions."}, {"heading": "1.1.2 Related Problems", "text": "A sister problem of Budget Allocation is Influence Maximization on general graphs, where a set of seed nodes is selected to start a propagation process. The influence function is still monotone submodular and amenable to the greedy algorithm Kempe et al. [2003], but it cannot be evaluated explicitly and requires approximation Chen et al. [2010]. Stochastic Coverage [Goemans & Vondra\u0301k, 2006] is a version of Set Cover where the covering sets Si \u2282 V are random. A variant of Budget Allocation can be written as stochastic coverage with multiplicity. Stochastic Coverage has mainly\nbeen studied in the online or adaptive setting, where logarithmic approximation factors can be achieved [Golovin & Krause, 2011; Deshpande et al., 2016; Adamczyk et al., 2016].\nOur objective function (2) is a signomial in p, i.e., a linear combination of monomials of the form \u220f i x ci i . General signomial optimization is NP-hard [Chiang, 2005], but certain subclasses are tractable: posynomials with all nonnegative coefficients can be minimized via Geometric Programming [Boyd et al., 2007], and signomials with a single negative coefficient admit sum of squares-like relaxations [Chandrasekaran & Shah, 2016]. Our problem, a constrained posynomial maximization, is not in general a geometric program. Some work addresses this setting via monomial approximation [Pascual & Ben-Israel, 1970; Ecker, 1980], but, to our knowledge, our algorithm is the first that solves this problem to arbitrary accuracy."}, {"heading": "1.1.3 Robust Optimization", "text": "Two prominent strategies of addressing uncertainty in parameters of optimization problems are stochastic and robust optimization. If the distribution of the parameters is known (stochastic optimization), formulations such as value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) Rockafellar & Uryasev [2000, 2002] apply. In contrast, robust optimization [Ben-Tal et al., 2009; Bertsimas et al., 2011] assumes that the parameters (of the cost function and constraints) can vary arbitrarily within a known confidence set U , and the aim is to optimize the worst-case setting, i.e.,\nmin y sup u,A,b\u2208U\n{g(y;u) s.t. Ay \u2264 b}. (4)\nHere, we will only have uncertainty in the cost function. In this paper we are principally concerned with robust maximization of the continuous influence function I(y), but mention some results for the discrete case. While there exist results for robust and CVaR optimization of modular (linear) functions [Nikolova, 2010; Bertsimas & Sim, 2003], submodular objectives do not in general admit such optimization Maehara [2015], but variants admit approximations [Zhang et al., 2014]. The brittleness of submodular optimization under noise has been studied in [Balkanski et al., 2016, 2017; Hassidim & Singer, 2016].\nApproximations for robust submodular and influence optimization have been studied in [Krause et al., 2008; He & Kempe, 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Lowalekar et al., 2016], where an adversary can pick among a finite set of objective functions or remove selected elements Orlin et al. [2016]."}, {"heading": "2 Robust and Stochastic Budget Allocation", "text": "The unknown parameters in Budget Allocation are the transmission probabilities pst or edge weights in a graph. If these are estimated from data, we may have posterior distributions or, a weaker assumption, confidence sets for the parameters.

For y in the nonnegative orthant, the term \u221a\nVar(I(y;X)) need not be convex or concave, and need not be submodular or supermodular.\nThis observation does not rule out a solution, but the apparent difficulties further motivate a robust formulation that, as we will see, is amenable to optimization."}, {"heading": "2.2 Robust Optimization", "text": "The focus of this work is the robust version of Budget Allocation, where we allow an adversary to arbitrarily set the parameters x within an uncertainty set X . This uncertainty set may result, for instance, from a known distribution, or simply assumed bounds. Formally, we solve\nmax y\u2208Y min x\u2208X\nI(y;x), (8)\nwhere Y \u2282 RS+ is a convex set with an efficient projection oracle, and X is an uncertainty set containing an estimate x\u0302. In the sequel, we use uncertainty sets X = {x \u2208 Box(l, u) : R(x) \u2264 B}, where R is a distance (or divergence) from the estimate x\u0302, and Box(l, u) is the box \u220f (s,t)\u2208E [lst, ust]. The intervals [lst, ust] can be thought of as either confidence intervals around x\u0302, or, if [lst, ust] = [0, 1], enforce that each xst is a valid probability.\nCommon examples of uncertainty sets used in Robust Optimization are Ellipsoidal and D-norm uncertainty sets Bertsimas et al. [2011]. Our algorithm in Section 3.1 applies to both.\nEllipsoidal uncertainty. The ellipsoidal or quadratic uncertainty set is defined by\nXQ(\u03b3) = {x \u2208 Box(0, 1) : (x\u2212 x\u0302)T\u03a3\u22121(x\u2212 x\u0302) \u2264 \u03b3},\nwhere \u03a3 is the covariance of the random vector X of probabilities distributed according to our Beta posteriors. In our case, since the distributions on each xst are independent, \u03a3\n\u22121 is actually diagonal. Writing \u03a3 = diag(\u03c32), we have\nXQ(\u03b3) = { x \u2208 Box(0, 1) : \u2211 (s,t)\u2208E Rst(xst) \u2264 \u03b3 } ,\nwhere Rst(x) = (xst \u2212 x\u0302st)2\u03c3\u22122st . D-norm uncertainty. The D-norm uncertainty set is similar to an `1-ball around x\u0302, and is defined as\nXD(\u03b3) = { x : \u2203c \u2208 Box(0, 1) s.t.\nxst = x\u0302st + (ust \u2212 x\u0302st)cst, \u2211\n(s,t)\u2208E\ncst \u2264 \u03b3 } .\nEssentially, we allow an adversary to increase x\u0302st up to some upper bound ust, subject to some total budget \u03b3 across all terms xst. The set XD(\u03b3) can be rewritten as\nXD(\u03b3) = { x \u2208 Box(x\u0302, u) : \u2211 (s,t)\u2208E Rst(xst) \u2264 \u03b3 } ,\nwhere Rst(xst) = (xst \u2212 x\u0302st)/(ust \u2212 x\u0302st) is the fraction of the interval [x\u0302st, ust] we have used up in increasing xst.\nThe min-max formulation maxy\u2208Y minx\u2208X I(y;x) has several merits: the model is not tied to a specific learning algorithm for the probabilities x as long as we can choose a suitable confidence set. Moreover, this formulation allows to fully hedge against a worst-case scenario."}, {"heading": "3 Optimization Algorithm", "text": "As noted above, the function I(y;x) is concave as a function of y for fixed x. As a pointwise minimum of concave functions, F (y) := minx\u2208X I(y;x) is concave. Hence, if we can compute subgradients of F (y), we can solve our max-min-problem via the subgradient method, as outlined in Algorithm 1.\nA subgradient gy \u2208 \u2202F (y) at y is given by the gradient of I(y;x\u2217) for the minimizing x\u2217 \u2208 arg minx\u2208X I(y;x), i.e., gy = \u2207yI(y;x\u2217). Hence, we must be able to compute x\u2217 for any y. We also obtain a duality gap: for any x\u2032, y\u2032 we have\nmin x\u2208X I(y\u2032;x) \u2264 max y\u2208Y min x\u2208X I(y;x) \u2264 max y\u2208Y I(y;x\u2032). (9)\nThis means we can estimate the optimal value I\u2217 and use it in Polyak\u2019s stepsize rule for the subgradient method Polyak [1987].\nBut I(y;x) is not convex in x, and not even quasiconvex. For example, standard methods [Wainwright & Chiang, 2004, Chapter 12] imply that f(x1, x2, x3) = 1\u2212 x1x2 \u2212 \u221a x3 is not quasiconvex on R3+. Moreover, the above-mentioned signomial optimization techniques do not apply for an exact solution either. So, it is not immediately clear that we can solve the inner optimization problem.\nThe key insight we will be using is that I(y;x) has a different beneficial property: while not convex, I(y;x) as a function of x is continuous submodular.\nLemma 3.1. Suppose we have n \u2265 1 differentiable functions fi : R\u2192 R+, for i = 1, . . . , n, either all nonincreasing or all nondecreasing. Then, f(x) = \u220fn i=1 fi(xi) is a continuous supermodular function from Rn to R+.\nAlgorithm 1 Subgradient Ascent\nInput: suboptimality tolerance \u03b5 > 0, initial feasible budget y(0) \u2208 Y Output: \u03b5-optimal budget y for Problem (8) repeat x(k) \u2190 arg minx\u2208X I(y(k);x) g(k) \u2190 \u2207yI(y(k);x(k)) L(k) \u2190 I(y(k);x(k)) U (k) \u2190 maxy\u2208Y I(y;x(k)) \u03b3(k) \u2190 (U (k) \u2212 L(k))/\u2016g(k)\u201622 y(k+1) \u2190 projY(y(k) + \u03b3(k)g(k)) k \u2190 k + 1 until U (k) \u2212 L(k) \u2264 \u03b5\nProof. For n = 1, the resulting function is modular and therefore supermodular. In the case n \u2265 2, we simply need to compute derivatives. The mixed derivatives are\n\u2202f\n\u2202xi\u2202xj = f \u2032i(xi)f \u2032 j(xj) \u00b7 \u220f k 6=i,j fk(xk). (10)\nBy monotonicity, f \u2032i and f \u2032 j have the same sign, so their product is nonnegative, and since each fk is nonnegative, the entire expression is nonnegative. Hence, f(x) is continuous supermodular by Theorem 3.2 of [Topkis, 1978].\nCorollary 3.1. The influence function I(y;x) defined in Section 2 is continuous submodular in x over the nonnegative orthant, for each y \u2265 0.\nProof. Since submodularity is preserved under summation, it suffices to show that each function It(y) is continuous submodular. By Lemma 3.1, since fs(z) = z y(s) is nonnegative and monotone\nnondecreasing for y(s) \u2265 0, the product \u220f\n(s,t)\u2208E x y(s) st is continuous supermodular in x. Flipping\nthe sign and adding a constant term yields It(y), which is hence continuous submodular.\nConjecture 3.1. Strong duality holds, i.e.\nmax y\u2208Y min x\u2208X I(y;x) = min x\u2208X max y\u2208Y I(y;x). (11)\nIf strong duality holds, then the duality gap maxy\u2208Y I(y;x\u2217)\u2212minx\u2208X I(y\u2217;x) in Equation (9) is zero at optimality. If I(y;x) were quasiconvex in x, strong duality would hold by Sion\u2019s min-max theorem, but this is not the case. In practice, we observe that the duality gap always converges to zero.\nBach [2015] demonstrates how to minimize a continuous submodular function H(x) subject to box constraints x \u2208 Box(l, u), up to an arbitrary suboptimality gap \u03b5 > 0. The constraint set X in our Robust Budget Allocation problem, however, has box constraints with an additional constraint R(x) \u2264 B. This case is not addressed in any previous work. Fortunately, for a large class of functions R, there is still an efficient algorithm for continuous submodular minimization, which we present in the next section."}, {"heading": "3.1 Constrained Continuous Submodular Function Minimization", "text": "We next address an algorithm for minimizing a monotone continuous submodular function H(x) subject to box constraints x \u2208 Box(l, u) and a constraint R(x) \u2264 B:\nminimize H(x) s.t. R(x) \u2264 B\nx \u2208 Box(l, u). (12)\nIf H and R were convex, the constrained problem would be equivalent to solving, with the right Lagrange multipler \u03bb\u2217 \u2265 0:\nminimize H(x) + \u03bb\u2217R(x) s.t. x \u2208 Box(l, u). (13)\nAlthough H and R are not necessarily convex here, it turns out that a similar approach indeed applies. The main idea of our approach bears similarity with [Nagano et al., 2011] for the set function case, but our setting with continuous functions and various uncertainty sets is more general, and requires more argumentation. We outline our theoretical results here, and defer further implementation details and proofs to the appendix.\nFollowing Bach [2015], we discretize the problem; for a sufficiently fine discretization, we will achieve arbitrary accuracy. Let A be an interpolation mapping that maps the discrete set \u220fn i=1[ki]\ninto Box(l, u) = \u220fn i=1[li, ui] via the componentwise interpolation functions Ai : [ki] \u2192 [li, ui]. We say Ai is \u03b4-fine if Ai(xi + 1) \u2212 Ai(xi) \u2264 \u03b4 for all xi \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , ki \u2212 2}, and we say the full interpolation function A is \u03b4-fine if each Ai is \u03b4-fine.\nThis mapping yields functions H\u03b4 : \u220fn i=1[ki]\u2192 R and R\u03b4 : \u220fn i=1[ki]\u2192 R via H\u03b4(x) = H(A(x)) and R\u03b4(x) = R(A(x)). H\u03b4 is lattice submodular (on the integer lattice). This construction leads to a reduction of Problem (12) to a submodular minimization problem over the integer lattice:\nminimize H\u03b4(x) + \u03bbR\u03b4(x) s.t. x \u2208 \u220fn i=1[ki].\n(14)\nIdeally, there should then exist a \u03bb such that the associated minimizer x(\u03bb) yields a close to optimal solution for the constrained problem. Theorem 3.1 below states that this is indeed the case.\nMoreover, a second benefit of submodularity is that we can find the entire solution path for Problem (14) by solving a single optimization problem.\nLemma 3.2. Suppose H is continuous submodular, and suppose the regularizer R is strictly increasing and separable: R(x) = \u2211n i=1Ri(xi). Then we can recover a minimizer x(\u03bb) for the induced discrete Problem (14) for any \u03bb \u2208 R by solving a single convex optimization problem.\nThe problem in question arises from a relaxation h\u2193 that extends H \u03b4 in each coordinate i to a function on distributions over the domain [ki]. These distributions are represented via their inverse cumulative distribution functions \u03c1i, which take the coordinate xi as input, and output the probability of exceeding xi. The function h\u2193 is an analogue of the Lova\u0301sz extension of set functions to continuous submodular functions [Bach, 2015], it is convex and coincides with H\u03b4 on lattice points.\nFormally, this resulting single optimization problem is: minimize h\u2193(\u03c1) + \u2211n\ni=1 \u2211ki\u22121 ji=1 aixi(\u03c1i(xi))\ns.t. \u03c1 \u2208 \u220fn i=1R ki\u22121 \u2193\n(15)\nwhere Rk\u2193 refers to the set of ordered vectors z \u2208 Rk that satisfy z1 \u2265 z2 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 zk, the notation \u03c1i(xi) denotes the xi-th coordinate of the vector \u03c1i, and the aixi are strictly convex functions given by\naixi(t) = 1\n2 t2 \u00b7 [R\u03b4i (xi)\u2212R\u03b4i (xi \u2212 1)]. (16)\nProblem (15) can be solved by Frank-Wolfe methods [Frank & Wolfe, 1956; Dunn & Harshbarger, 1978; Lacoste-Julien, 2016; Jaggi, 2013]. This is because the greedy algorithm for computing subgradients of the Lova\u0301sz extension can be generalized, and yields a linear optimization oracle for the dual of Problem (15). We detail the relationship between Problems (14) and (15), as well as how to implement the Frank-Wolfe methods, in Appendix C.\nLet \u03c1\u2217 be the optimal solution for Problem (15). For any \u03bb, we obtain a rounded solution x(\u03bb) for Problem (14) by thresholding: we set x(\u03bb)i = max{j | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 ki \u2212 1, \u03c1\u2217i (j) \u2265 \u03bb}, or zero if \u03c1\u2217i (j) < \u03bb for all j. Each x(\u03bb\n\u2032) is the optimal solution for Problem (14) with \u03bb = \u03bb\u2032. We use the largest parameterized solution x(\u03bb) that is still feasible, i.e. the solution x(\u03bb\u2217) where \u03bb\u2217 solves\nmin H\u03b4(x(\u03bb)) s.t. \u03bb \u2265 0\nR\u03b4(x(\u03bb)) \u2264 B. (17)\nThis \u03bb\u2217 can be found efficiently via binary search or a linear scan.\nTheorem 3.1. Let H be continuous submodular and monotone decreasing, with `\u221e-Lipschitz constant G, and let R be strictly increasing and separable. Assume all entries \u03c1\u2217i (j) of the optimal solution \u03c1\u2217 of Problem (15) are distinct. Let x\u2032 = A(x(\u03bb\u2217)) be the thresholding corresponding to the optimal solution \u03bb\u2217 of Problem (17), mapped back into the original continuous domain X . Then x\u2032 is feasible for the continuous Problem (12), and is a 2G\u03b4-approximate solution:\nH(x\u2032) \u2264 2G\u03b4 + min x\u2208Box(l,u), R(x)\u2264B H(x).\nTheorem 3.1 implies an algorithm for solving Problem (12) to \u03b5-optimality: (1) set \u03b4 = \u03b5/G, (2) compute \u03c1\u2217 which solves Problem (15), (3) find the optimal thresholding of \u03c1\u2217 by determining the smallest \u03bb\u2217 for which R\u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2217)) \u2264 B, and (4) map x(\u03bb\u2217) back into continuous space via the interpolation mapping A.\nOptimality Bounds. Theorem 3.1 is proved by comparing x\u2032 and x\u2217 to the optimal solution on the discretized mesh\nx\u2217d \u2208 argmin x\u2208 \u220fn i=1[ki]:R \u03b4(x)\u2264B H\u03b4(x).\nBeyond the theoretical guarantee of Theorem 3.1, for any problem instance and candidate solution x\u2032, we can compute a bound on the gap between H(x\u2032) and H\u03b4(x\u2217d). The following two bounds are proved in the appendix:\n1. We can generate a discrete point x(\u03bb+) satisfying\nH(x\u2032) \u2264 [H(x\u2032)\u2212H\u03b4(x(\u03bb+))] +H\u03b4(x\u2217d).\n2. The Lagrangian yields the bound\nH(x\u2032) \u2264 \u03bb\u2217(B \u2212R(x\u2032)) +H\u03b4(x\u2217d).\nImprovements. The requirement in Theorem 3.1 that the elements of \u03c1\u2217 be distinct may seem somewhat restrictive, but as long as \u03c1\u2217 has distinct elements in the neighborhood of our particular \u03bb\u2217, this bound still holds. We see in Section 4.1.1 that in practice, \u03c1\u2217 almost always has distinct elements in the regime we care about, and the bounds of Remark 3.1 are very good.\nIf H is DR-submodular and R is affine in each coordinate, then Problem (14) can be represented more compactly via the reduction of Ene & Nguyen [2016], and hence problem (12) can be solved more efficiently. In particular, the influence function I(y;x) is DR-submodular in x when for each s, y(s) = 0 or y(s) \u2265 1."}, {"heading": "3.2 Application to Robust Budget Allocation", "text": "The above algorithm directly applies to Robust Allocation with the uncertainty sets in Section 2.2.

By the monotonicity of I(x, y), there is never incentive to reduce any xst below x\u0302st, so we can replace Box(0, 1) with Box(x\u0302, 1). On this interval, each Rst is strictly increasing, and Theorem 3.1 applies.\nFor D-norm sets, we have Rst(xst) = (xst \u2212 x\u0302st)/(ust \u2212 x\u0302st). Since each Rst is monotone, Theorem 3.1 applies.\nRuntime and Alternatives.

However, we are not aware of a practical implementation of the algorithm in [Lee et al., 2015]. The algorithm in [Chakrabarty et al., 2017] yields a solution in expectation.

Although the inner optimization problem is nonconvex, we show how continuous submodularity can be leveraged to solve the problem to arbitrary accuracy \u03b5, as can be verified with the proposed bounds on the duality gap. In particular, our approach extends continuous submodular minimization methods [Bach, 2015] to more general constraint sets, introducing a mechanism to solve a new class of constrained nonconvex optimization problems. We confirm on synthetic and real data that our method finds high-quality solutions that are robust to parameters varying arbitrarily in an uncertainty set, and scales up to graphs with over 50,000 edges.\nThere are many compelling directions for further study. The uncertainty sets we use are standard in the robust optimization literature, but have not been applied to e.g. Robust Influence Maximization; it would be interesting to generalize our ideas to general graphs.

(36)\nWe can also bound the optimal value of H\u03b4(x\u2217d) from the other side:\nH\u03b4(x\u2217d) = min x\u2208 \u220fn i=1[ki]:R \u03b4(x)\u2264B H\u03b4(x) \u2264 min \u03bb\u22650:R\u03b4(x(\u03bb))\u2264B H\u03b4(x) = H\u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2212)) (37)\nbecause the set of x(\u03bb) parameterized by \u03bb is a subset of the full set {x \u2208 \u220fn i=1[ki] : R\n\u03b4(x) \u2264 B}. We have now bounded the optimal value of H\u03b4(x\u2217d) on either side by optimization problems\nwhere we seek an optimal \u03bb \u2265 0 for the parameterization x(\u03bb):\nH\u03b4(x(\u03bb+)) \u2264 H\u03b4(x\u2217d) \u2264 H\u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2212)). (38)\nRecall that x(\u03bb) comes from thresholding the values of \u03c1\u2217 by \u03bb, and that we assume that the elements of \u03c1\u2217 are unique. Hence, as we increase \u03bb, the components of x decrease by 1 each time. Combining this with the strict monotonicity of R, we see that \u2016x(\u03bb+) \u2212 x(\u03bb\u2212)\u2016\u221e \u2264 1. By the Lipschitz properties of H\u03b4, it follows that\n\u2223\u2223H\u03b4(x(\u03bb+))\u2212H\u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2212))\u2223\u2223 \u2264 G\u03b4. Since H\u03b4(x\u2217d) lies in the interval between H\u03b4(x(\u03bb+)) and H \u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2212)), it follows that \u2223\u2223H\u03b4(x\u2217d)\u2212H\u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2212))\u2223\u2223 \u2264 G\u03b4.\nC.3 Proof of Remark 3.1\nDefine \u03bb\u2217 = \u03bb\u2212 as in the previous section, so that x \u2032 = A(x(\u03bb\u2217). The x(\u03bb+) bound is a simple consequence from the above result that\nH\u03b4(x(\u03bb+)) \u2264 H\u03b4(x\u2217d) \u2264 H\u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2212)) = H(x\u2032).\nAs for the Lagrangian bound, since x(\u03bb\u2217) is a minimizer for the regularized function H\u03b4(x) + \u03bb\u2217(R\u03b4(x)\u2212B), it follows that\nH\u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2217)) + \u03bb\u2217(R\u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2217))\u2212B) \u2264 H\u03b4(x\u2217d) + \u03bb\u2217(R\u03b4(x\u2217d)\u2212B). (39)\nRearranging, and observing that R\u03b4(x\u2217d) \u2264 B because x\u2217d is feasible, it holds that\nH(x\u2032) = H\u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2217)) \u2264 H\u03b4(x\u2217d) + \u03bb\u2217(R\u03b4(x\u2217d)\u2212R\u03b4(x(\u03bb\u2217))) \u2264 H\u03b4(x\u2217d) + \u03bb\u2217(B \u2212R(x\u2032)). (40)\nOne can also combine either of these bounds with the result from the proof of Theorem 3.1 that H\u03b4(x\u2217d) \u2264 G\u03b4 +H(x\u2217) yielding e.g.\nH(x\u2032) \u2264 G\u03b4 + \u03bb\u2217(B \u2212R(x\u2032)) +H\u03b4(x\u2217d).\nC.4 Solving the Optimization Problem\nNow that we have proven equivalence results between the constrained problem we want to solve and the convex problem (24), we need to actually solve the convex problem. At the beginning of Section 5.2 in Bach [2015], it is stated that this surrogate problem can optimized via the FrankWolfe method and its variants, but only the the version of Problem (24) without the extra functions aixi is elaborated upon. Here we detail how Frank-Wolfe algorithms can be used to solve the more general parametric regularized problem. Our aim is to spell out very clearly the applicability of Frank-Wolfe to this problem, for the ease of future practitioners.\nBach [2015] notes that by duality, Problem (24) is equivalent to:\nmin \u03c1\u2208 \u220fn i=1 R ki\u22121 \u2193 h\u2193(\u03c1)\u2212H(0) + n\u2211 i=1 ki\u22121\u2211 xi=1 aixi [\u03c1i(xi)] = min \u03c1\u2208 \u220fn i=1 R ki\u22121 \u2193 max w\u2208B(H) \u3008\u03c1, w\u3009+ n\u2211 i=1 ki\u22121\u2211 xi=1 aixi [\u03c1i(xi)]\n= max w\u2208B(H)  min\u03c1\u2208\u220fni=1 Rki\u22121\u2193 \u3008\u03c1, w\u3009+ n\u2211 i=1 ki\u22121\u2211 xi=1 aixi [\u03c1i(xi)]  := max\nw\u2208B(H) f(w).\nHere, the base polytope B(H) happens to be the convex hull of all vectors w which could be output by the greedy algorithm in Bach [2015].\nIt is the dual problem, where we maximize over w, which is amenable to Frank-Wolfe. For FrankWolfe methods, we need two oracles: an oracle which, given w, returns \u2207f(w); and an oracle which, given\u2207f(w), produces a point s which solves the linear optimization problem maxs\u2208B(H)\u3008s,\u2207f(w)\u3009.\nPer Bach [2015], an optimizer of the linear problem can be computed directly from the greedy algorithm. For the gradient oracle, recall that we can find a subgradient of g(x) = miny h(x, y) at the point x0 by finding y(x0) which is optimal for the inner problem, and then computing \u2207xh(x, y(x0)). Moreover, if such y(x0) is the unique optimizer, then the resulting vector is indeed the gradient of g(x) at x0. Hence, in our case, it suffices to first find \u03c1(w) which solves the inner problem, and then \u2207f(w) is simply \u03c1(w) because the inner function is linear in w. Since each function aixi is strictly convex, the minimizer \u03c1(w) is unique, confirming that we indeed get a gradient of f , and that f is differentiable.\nOf course, we still need to compute the minimizer \u03c1(w). For a given w, we want to solve\nmin \u03c1\u2208 \u220fn i=1 R ki\u22121 \u2193 \u3008\u03c1, w\u3009+ n\u2211 i=1 ki\u22121\u2211 xi=1 aixi [\u03c1i(xi)]\nThere are no constraints coupling the vectors \u03c1i, and the objective is similarly separable, so we can independently solve n problems of the form\nmin \u03c1\u2208Rk\u22121\u2193 \u3008\u03c1, w\u3009+ k\u22121\u2211 j=1 aj(\u03c1j).\nRecall that each function aiyi(t) takes the form 1 2 t 2riyi for some riyi > 0. Let D = diag(r), the\n(k \u2212 1)\u00d7 (k \u2212 1) matrix with diagonal entries rj . Our problem can then be written as\nmin \u03c1\u2208Rk\u22121\u2193\n\u3008\u03c1, w\u3009+ 1 2 k\u22121\u2211 j=1 rj\u03c1 2 j = min \u03c1\u2208Rk\u22121\u2193 \u3008\u03c1, w\u3009+ 1 2 \u3008D\u03c1, \u03c1\u3009\n= min \u03c1\u2208Rk\u22121\u2193\n\u3008D1/2\u03c1, D\u22121/2w\u3009+ 1 2 \u3008D1/2\u03c1, D1/2\u03c1\u3009.\nCompleting the square, the above problem is equivalent to\nmin \u03c1\u2208Rk\u22121\u2193 \u2016D1/2\u03c1+D\u22121/2w\u201622 = min \u03c1\u2208Rk\u22121\u2193 k\u22121\u2211 j=1 (r 1/2 j \u03c1j + r \u22121/2 j wj) 2\n= min \u03c1\u2208Rk\u22121\u2193 k\u22121\u2211 j=1 rj(\u03c1j + r \u22121 j wj) 2.\nThis last expression is precisely the problem which is called weighted isotonic regression: we are fitting \u03c1 to diag(r\u22121)w, with weights r, subject to a monotonicity constraint. Weighted isotonic regression is solved efficiently via the Pool Adjacent Violators algorithm of Best & Chakravarti [1990].\nC.5 Runtime\nFrank-Wolfe returns an \u03b5-suboptimal solution in O(\u03b5\u22121D2L) iterations, where D is the diameter of the feasible region, and L is the Lipschitz constant for the gradient of the objective [Jaggi, 2013]. Our optimization problem is maxw\u2208B(H) f(w) as defined in the previous section. Each w \u2208 B(H) has O(n\u03b4\u22121) coordinates of the form H\u03b4(x + ei) \u2212 H\u03b4(x). Since H\u03b4 is an expected influence in the range [0, T ], we can bound the magnitude of each coordinate of w by T and hence D2 by O(n\u03b4\u22121T 2). If \u03b1 is the minimum derivative of the functions Ri, then the smallest coefficient of the functions aixi(t) is bounded below by \u03b1\u03b4. Hence the objective is the conjugate of an \u03b1\u03b4-strongly convex function, and therefore has \u03b1\u22121\u03b4\u22121-Lipschitz gradient. Combining these, we arrive at the O(\u03b5\u22121n\u03b4\u22122\u03b1\u22121T 2) iteration bound. The most expensive step in each iteration is computing the subgradient, which requires sorting the O(n\u03b4\u22121) elements of \u03c1 in time O(n\u03b4\u22121 log n\u03b4\u22121). Hence the total runtime of Frank-Wolfe is O(\u03b5\u22121n2\u03b4\u22123\u03b1\u22121T 2 log n\u03b4\u22121).\nAs specified in the main text, relating an approximate solution of (15) to a solution of (14) is nontrivial. Assume \u03c1\u2217 has distinct elements separated by \u03b7, and chose \u03b5 to be less than \u03b72\u03b1\u03b4/8. If \u03c1 is \u03b5-suboptimal, then by \u03b1\u03b4-strong convexity we must have \u2016\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1\u2217\u20162 < \u03b7/2, and therefore \u2016\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1\u2217\u2016\u221e < \u03b7/2. Since the smallest consecutive gap between elements of \u03c1\u2217 is \u03b7, this implies that \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2217 have the same ordering, and therefore admit the same solution x after thresholding. Accounting for this choice in \u03b5, we have an exact solution to (14) in total runtime ofO(\u03b7\u22122n2\u03b4\u22124\u03b1\u22122T 2 log n\u03b4\u22121)."}, {"heading": "D Expectation and Variance of the Influence Function", "text": "We wish to study the influence I(X, y), its expectation and its variance as a function of y. By definition, the influence function is given by\nI(X, y) = \u2211 t\u2208T 1\u2212 \u220f (s,t)\u2208E X y(s) st  . (41) Before we prove the stated results, we will simplify the functions involved.\nMaximizing I(X, y) is equivalent to minimizing the function\u2211 t\u2208T \u220f (s,t)\u2208E X y(s) st (42)\nand vice-versa. The particular properties we are interested in, namely convexity and submodularity, are preserved under sums. Moreover, expectation is linear and variances add, so for our purposes we can focus on only one term of the above sum. After reindexing in terms of i = 1, . . . , n instead of (s, t) \u2208 E, we are left studying functions of the form\nf(y) = n\u220f i=1 Xyii .

We can then compute each component of the gradient of E[f(y)]:\n\u2202\n\u2202yi (E[f(y)]) = n\u220f i=1\n1 B(\u03b1i, \u03b2i) \u00b7 \u220f j 6=i B(\u03b1j + yj , \u03b2j) \u00b7 \u2202 \u2202yi (B(\u03b1i + yi, \u03b2i)) (53)\n= n\u220f i=1\n1 B(\u03b1i, \u03b2i) \u00b7 \u220f j 6=i B(\u03b1j + yj , \u03b2j) \u00b7B(\u03b1i + yi, \u03b2i) \u00b7 (\u03c8(\u03b1i + yi)\u2212 \u03c8(\u03b1i + yi + \u03b2i))\n(54)\n= E[f(y)] \u00b7 (\u03c8(\u03b1i + yi)\u2212 \u03c8(\u03b1i + yi + \u03b2i)). (55)\nD.2 Counterexample for Fact 2.1 We give a specific choice of parameters n, \u03b1i, \u03b2i and yi for which the resulting function \u221a\nVar(f(y)) is non-convex, non-concave, non-submodular and non-supermodular for various points y \u2208 Rn+. For the case T = 1, the function 1\u2212f(y) is a valid influence function, so we have a valid counterexample for \u221a\nVar(I(X, y)). Consider the case n = 2, with \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 1 and \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 1. This corresponds to the Budget Allocation problem where we have two sources each with an edge to one customer, and we have only our prior (i.e. no data) on either of the edge probabilities. Using equation (51), we can directly compute the Hessian of \u221a Var(f(y)) at any point y, e.g. using Mathematica.
