They enable to compare two objects, usually alternatives, criteria, qualities or features, at the same time. Pairwise comparisons are especially useful when the number of object to be compared is large, as they reduce complexity of a problem and aid to avoid a cognitive overload, as according to Miller (1956), humans are only able to compare 7 objects at one time. Also, from pairwise comparisons a priority vector (a vector of weights of compared objects) can be derived via some well-known method such as the eigenvalue method or the geometric mean method (the least logarithmic squares method), for the former see e. g. see Saaty (1980, 2004 and 2008), for the latter see e. g. Chandran et al. (2005). In particular, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is perhaps the best known application of pairwise comparisons, successful applications of the AHP can be found e. g. in Vaidya and Kumar (2006).\nRecently, research on pairwise comparisons is focused on the problem of inconsistency of pairwise comparisons and their comparison and axiomatization. When comparing for example three alternatives, A, B and C, a decision maker has to perform three pairwise comparisons: A with B, A with C and B with C. If A is set to be 2 times better than B and B is set to be 3 times better than C, A should be 6 times better than C. Although the task seems simple, decision makers are seldom consistent, and their judgments are \u201cerroneous\u201d to a certain degree. To measure the inconsistence of their judgments, several inconsistency indices (see section 2) were proposed.\nNevertheless, these indices can be considered ad-hoc in a sort of way; they were introduced independently and spontaneously. That is why the problem of axiomatization is studied extensively in the last years, see Koczkodaj and Szwarc (2014), Ram\u00edk (2015) or Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015). Nevertheless, the problem of axiomatization is not over yet, as new indices emerge, especially in extensions of pairwise comparisons to fuzzy sets and Abelian linearly ordered groups, see for instance Cavallo and D\u2019Apuzzo (2009) or Ram\u00edk and Korv\u00edny (2010).\nThis paper aims to contribute to the ongoing research. The main aim of this paper is to introduce a new inconsistency index, which is based on a dot (scalar) product of row vectors of a pairwise comparisons matrix, and to prove its properties. Also, properties of Koczkodaj\u2019s inconsistency index are proved as well. Last, but not least, another sixth axiom, the upper boundary for index\u2019s value, is added to the five axioms of Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015), and it is examined whether selected inconsistency indices satisfy it or not.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in section 1 preliminaries are provided, section 2 describes inconsistency indices and section 3 inconsistency axioms, in section 4 a new inconsistency index is introduced and its properties are proved, in section 5 selected indices are examined with respect to an additional axiom, and section 6 includes a numerical example. Conclusions close the article.\n1. Preliminaries For simplicity, but without loss of generality, let us consider pairwise comparisons of alternatives. Let X be a given set of n alternatives to be compared. Let aij denote the preference of i-th alternative over j-th alternative. Also, we set 0ija > ; { }, 1, 2,...,i j n\u2200 \u2208 . Pairwise comparisons are called reciprocal, if the following property is satisfied:\n{ }1 , , 1, 2,...,ij ji a i j n a = \u2200 \u2208 . (1)\nThe property (1) is usually strictly required for pairwise comparisons. All pairwise comparisons can be arranged into a square n n\u00d7 matrix ( )ijA a called a pairwise comparison matrix (PCM):\n12 1\n21 2\n1 2\n1 ...\n1 ... ( )\n... ... 1 ...\n... 1\nn\nn\nn n ij\nn n\na a\na a A a\na a\n\u00d7\n     =      \nFurther, pairwise comparisons are called consistent, if the following property is satisfied: ; , ,ij jk ika a a i j k\u22c5 = \u2200 . (2) From a pairwise comparisons matrix A weights of alternatives (a priority vector) w can be derived via Saaty\u2019s eigenvalue method (EM): maxAw w\u03bb= , (3) where max\u03bb is the largest (positive) eigenvalue of A. The existence of the largest (positive) eigenvalue max\u03bb of the matrix A is guaranteed by Perron-Frobenius theorem (Saaty 1980). Also, the geometric mean method (the least squares method) can be used to obtain w:\n1/\n1\n1/\n1 1\nn n\nij j\ni n nn\nij i j\na\nw\na\n=\n= =      =       \u220f \u2211 \u220f (4)\nBoth methods yield the same result when the matrix A is consistent. Otherwise, the priority vectors differ slightly, see the comparative study of Ishizaka and Lusti (2006). For further considerations it should be noted that if the matrix A is reciprocal and consistent, then max n\u03bb = and rank(A) = 1, which means all rows (columns) of A differ only by a multiplicative constant. Definition 1. Let MR denote the set of all matrices ( )n n ijA a\u00d7 , 0ija > ; { }, 1, 2,...,i j n\u2200 \u2208 , satisfying (1), and let MC denote the set of all matrices ( )n n ijA a\u00d7 , 0ija > ; { }, 1, 2,...,i j n\u2200 \u2208 satisfying (2). By the definition above, MR is the set of all reciprocal pairwise comparison matrices with positive elements of the order n, and MC is the set of all consistent pairwise comparison matrices with positive elements of the order n. Remark 1. As the matrix A with elements 1, ,ija i j= \u2200 belongs both to MR and MC, both sets are non-empty, and clearly: C rM M\u2282 . Furthermore, consistency (2) implies reciprocity (1), but not vice versa. Definition 2. A corner pairwise comparison matrix CPC of the order n is defined as follows:\n      \n\n      \n\n=\u00d7\n11...1/1\n11...11\n...............\n11...11\n1...11\nx\nx\nCPC nn , x > 0.\nA corner pairwise comparison matrix is a special (simplified) case of a reciprocal matrix, which is consistent if and only if x = 1."}, {"heading": "2. Inconsistency indices", "text": "In this section, several inconsistency indices for a pairwise comparison matrix are going to be introduced, starting with the oldest one, Saaty\u2019s consistency index C.I.\n\u2022 Consistency index C.I. (Saaty, 1980):\n1 .. max \u2212 \u2212 = n n IC \u03bb (5)\nAccording to Saaty, a PCM with C.I. lower or equal to 0.10 is sufficiently consistent, and EM method (3) can be employed. However, C.I. grows with n, that is why Saaty introduced a more suitable measure of inconsistency, the consistency ratio C.R.\n\u2022 Consistency ratio C. R. (Saaty, 2004, 2008): . .\n. . . .\nC I C R\nR I = (6)\nThe R.I. in (6) is the random inconsistency, that is an average of C.I. of random matrices (generated by the Monte Carlo method) of the order n. For the values of R.I. se e.g. (Alonso and Lamata, 2006). Again, a PCM with C.R. lower or equal to 0.10 is sufficiently consistent for the eigenvalue method. Nevertheless, the rule of thumb of 0.10 was criticized by some authors, see Dyer (1990) or Koczkodaj and Szybowski (2014). Notably, R.I. was found to converge to the value 1.58 with increasing n. This fact drew some criticism of C.R. (and C.I.), as random inconsistency should be increasing with the increasing n (the larger is a random matrix, the more \u201cmess\u201d it contains).\n\u2022 Index GWI, Golden and Wang (1989): Let ( )ij RA a M\u2208 and let ( )ijA a be the normalized matrix obtained from A by dividing each column by a sum of all elements\nin a corresponding column. Further, let w be the normalized priority vector (the vector of weights) obtained from A by the EM or the geometric mean method. Then the inconsistency index GWI is defined as:\n1 1\n1 n n ij i\ni j GWI a w n = = = \u2212\u2211\u2211 (7)\n\u2022 Index PLI, Pelaez-Lamata (2003): Let ( )ij RA a M\u2208 .

Majority of indices capture a central tendency (a mean) of inconsistent judgments. On the other hand, Koczkodaj\u2019s inconsistency index aims to express the largest inconsistency present in a given PCM. It should be noted that indices such as PLI or GWI can be easily modified to return the maximum inconsistency as well, by substituting the averaging operators for the maximum operator. Therefore, indices might be divided into two groups:\n\u2022 Mean-based (C.I., C.R., GWI, PLI, GCI),\n\u2022 Extreme-based (KII).\nAdvantage of the mean-based indices is that they take into account every pairwise comparison (and its changes), but they do not provide (explicitly) information about extremes. On the other hand, extreme-based indices express the inconsistency in terms of the most inconsistent judgment, which can be useful when the most \u201cerroneous\u201d comparison is to be found and revised. Disadvantage of this class of indices is that all changes besides the most inconsistent comparison (a triad) are neglected. This may lead to the idea of a new (compromise) family of indices of the following form:\n[ ](1 ) , 0,1compr mean extremeIC IC IC\u03bb \u03bb \u03bb= \u22c5 + \u2212 \u22c5 \u2208 , where a decision maker decides how he/she wants to capture both features by selecting an appropriate value of \u03bb , where 0\u03bb = yields an extreme index and 1\u03bb = a central based index."}, {"heading": "3. Axioms for inconsistency indices", "text": "An inconsistency index should have some reasonable properties. Koczkodaj and Szwarc (2014) introduced three axioms an inconsistency index must satisfy, while Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015) postulated five axioms. Two axioms are identical in both papers. Below, the five axioms according to Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015) are provided with slight modifications, along with a newly formulated Axiom 6. Definition 3. An inconsistency index (ICI) is a real-valued function:\nICI: [ ]0,rA M\u2208 \u2192 \u221e , or alternatively, ICI: [ ]0,1rA M\u2208 \u2192 .\nAxiom 1. cA M\u2208 ( ) 0ICI A\u21d4 = . Axiom 1 states that consistent pairwise comparison matrices are identified by a unique real value of inconsistency. Usually, this value is set to 0, as zero inconsistency means consistency. Axiom 2. Let P denote a permutation matrix of the order n and let n n rA M\u00d7 \u2208 . Then for all P and all A\u00b4, so that \u00b4 TA P A P= \u22c5 \u22c5 , the following condition holds:\n( )\u0301 ( ),ICI A ICI A P= \u2200 .\nAxiom 2 expresses that the inconsistency index is invariant under permutation of alternatives. In other words, changing of an order of alternatives should not result in a change of an inconsistency index. Axiom 3. Let f be a continuous transformation: : ; , ; , 0bij ijf a a i j b R b\u2192 \u2200 \u2208 > . Let the matrix with elements bija be denoted as bA . Then:\n( ) ( )bICI A ICI A\u2265\nAxiom 3 deals with monotonicity of intensity of preference: if preferences are intensified, then an inconsistency index cannot return a lower value. Axiom 4. Let CA M\u2208 and let at least one 1ija \u2260 for i j\u2260 . Let A \u03b4 denote a matrix obtained from A by substituting the element 1ija \u2260 (and also 1jia \u2260 ) by the element ija \u03b4 , where , 0, 1R\u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b4\u2208 > \u2260 . Then ( )ICI A\u03b4 is a non-decreasing function for 1\u03b4 > and a nonincreasing function for 1<\u03b4 . Axiom 4 requires monotonicity on a single comparison: the larger is the change in a given entry aij (and aji respectively) from a consistent matrix, the more inconsistent is the resulting matrix and the higher is the value of an inconsistency index. Axiom 5. An inconsistency index is a continuous function of its entries. Axiom 5 ensures there are not \u201cjumps\u201d or other discontinuities of ICI values. Whether the presented set of five axioms is the best possible (optimal) choice is certainly open to a discussion. One feature not captured by the five axioms is the problem of upper boundary of an inconsistency index. If an inconsistency index is not bounded from above, it might be problematic to interpret its values (what information a decision maker obtains when ICI is, for example, equal to 984,669?). Therefore, it seems more natural to introduce an upper bound on ICI. Axiom 6. ICI is bounded from above if and only if: rMAKAICIRK \u2208\u2200\u2264\u2208\u2203 ,)(; . Table 1 summarizes which axioms are (not)satisfied by indices (5), (7-11). It is based on Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015), but it is extended to encompass indices KII and RIC (introduced later), and also it is extended to Axiom 6."}, {"heading": "4. A new index of inconsistency of a pairwise comparisons matrix", "text": "The concept of this new measure of inconsistency of a pairwise comparisons matrix (PCM) comes from a geometrical point of view: the rows of a PCM can be considered vectors in the\nn-dimensional Euclidean space. If a PCM is fully consistent, then the PCM\u2019s rows are collinear (they differ only by a multiplicative constant). When an inconsistency appears, the rows will not be collinear any more, and their \u201cdeviation\u201c from collinearity can be expressed by a cosine of an angle between each pair of row vectors. Again, we set ( )0,ija \u2208 \u221e . Let ( )1,...,i i inr a a= and ( )1, ...,j j jnr a a= be the row vectors of a pairwise comparison matrix\nrA M\u2208 of the order n. Then the inconsistence index based on the rows of A is given as:\n\u2022 Row inconsistency index (RIC): Let ( )n n ij rA a M\u00d7 \u2208 . Then RIC is given as follows:\n1\n1 2 cos 1\n( 1)\nn n\nij i j iRIC n n\n\u03d5 \u2212\n= >= \u2212 \u2212\n\u2211\u2211 , (11)\nwhere cos i jij i j\nr r\nr r \u03d5\n\u22c5 =\n\u22c5 , and i jr r\u22c5 denotes the dot product. (12)\nIndex RIC is the only \u201cgeometrically\u201d based inconsistency index, which is equal to 1 minus the arithmetic mean of cosines of all pairs of row vectors of a given PCM. Also, the values of this index are conveniently bounded to the interval [ ]0,1 (which is going to be proved below), unlike the indices (8) and (9). It should be noted that although the definition of RIC is based on the row vectors, the use of column vectors of the matrix A would be feasible as well. Now, some properties satisfied by this index (11) will be discussed. Remark 2. Because 0, ,ija i j> \u2200 , the angle ij\u03d5 satisfies 0 90ij\u03d5\u2264 < \u00b0 for all ri and rj, and 0 cos 1ij\u03d5\u2264 < . Proposition 1. cA M\u2208 \u21d4 RIC = 0. Proof : When A is consistent, its rows are collinear, thus 0, ,ij i j\u03d5 = \u2200 and cos 1, ,ij i j\u03d5 = \u2200 , which yields ICI = 0.\nIf RIC = 0, then\n1\n1 2 cos 1\n( 1)\nn n\nij i j i\nn n\n\u03d5 \u2212 = > = \u2212 \u2211\u2211 . Since the codomain of cosine is [ ]1,1\u2212 and the number of\ncosine terms in the nominator is 2 n      , we get immediately cos 1, ,ij i j i\u03d5 = \u2200 > ; hence, the row vectors ir are collinear, rank (A) = 1 and cA M\u2208 . Proposition 2. 0RIC A> \u21d4 is not consistent. Proof: Assume that 0RIC > , then at least one cos 1ij\u03d5 < , which means at least one 0ij\u03d5 > , therefore there are at least two row vector that are non-collinear; hence the rank (A) 2\u2265 and A is not consistent. Now assume that A is not consistent. Then rank (A) 2\u2265 , so at least two row vectors are not collinear and at least one 0ij\u03d5 > , therefore at least one element cos 1ij\u03d5 < , which yields\n0RIC > .\nProposition 3. 0 1RIC\u2264 \u2264 . Proof: Since all elements of a matrix A are positive, all row vectors r lie in the first orthant of the space Rn. Hence, from (12) we get cos 0, ,ij i j i\u03d5 \u2265 \u2200 > , but also cos 1, ,ij i j i\u03d5 \u2264 \u2200 > .\nTherefore,\n1\n1 2 cos 0 1\n( 1)\nn n\nij i j i\nn n\n\u03d5 \u2212\n= >\u2264 \u2264 \u2212\n\u2211\u2211 , and finally\n1\n1 2 cos 0 1 1\n( 1)\nn n\nij i j iRIC n n\n\u03d5 \u2212\n= >\u2264 = \u2212 \u2264 \u2212\n\u2211\u2211 .\nProposition 4. RIC is an increasing function in each argument ij\u03d5 . Proof: It suffices to show that the first derivative of (1) is positive:\n( ) 2 sin\n\u00b4 0 , ( 1) ij i jRIC i j n n\n\u03c6 = \u2265 \u2200\n\u2212\n\u2211\u2211 , since sin 0ij\u03d5 \u2265 for all [ ]0,90ij\u03d5 \u2208 .\nProposition 5. RIC is a concave function in each argument ij\u03d5 . Proof: Let fix all ij\u03d5 except for one. Then, a function of one (real) variable is concave if its\nsecond derivative is negative. Therefore, we get: 2 cos\n1 ( 1) ij i jRIC n n\n\u03c6 = \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2211\u2211 ,\nso ( ) 2 sin\n\u00b4 ( 1) ij i jRIC n n\n\u03c6 =\n\u2212\n\u2211\u2211 and ( ) 2 cos \u00b4\u0301\n( 1) ij i jRIC n n\n\u03c6 = \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2211\u2211 . Because jiij ,,0cos \u2200\u2265\u03d5 we obtain\n( )\u0301 \u00b4 0RIC \u2264 . Proposition 6. RIC satisfies Axiom 1. Proof: It was already proven in Proposition 1. Proposition 7. RIC satisfies Axiom 2. Proof: The statement is obvious, as the average value of cos ij\u03d5 in (11) is computed from all pairs of rows regardless of their order (all rows are treated equally). Proposition 8. RIC does not satisfy Axiom 3. Proof by a counterexample: Let rA M\u2208 be the pairwise comparisons matrix as follows:\n1 0.1 0.15\n10 1 0.3\n6.6666 3.3333 1\nA    =       , RIC(A) = 0.047.\nLet B be the pairwise comparisons matrix obtained from the matrix A by raising each entry of the matrix A to the power of two:\n( 2)\n1 0.01 0.0225\n10 1 0.09\n44.4444 11.1111 1 bB A =    = =       , RIC(B)=0.018\nThus, although preferences expressed in the matrix B are \u201cstronger\u201d, the inconsistency index RIC returns a smaller value.\nProposition 9. RIC satisfies Axiom 4. Proof: As RIC is increasing with the angle \u03d5 between any two row vectors of A (see Proposition 4), the more the matrix A changes in one element (and its reciprocal) from a consistent form, the larger is the angle \u03d5 between this row and other rows, hence the larger is RIC as well. Proposition 10. RIC satisfies Axiom 5. Proof: The proof is obvious as the cosine function in (11) is continuous. Proposition 11. RIC satisfies Axiom 6. Proof: 1RIC < was already proven in Proposition 3. 5. Koczkodaj\u2019s index and the satisfaction of the Axiom 6 by C.I., GWI, PLI, and GCI The KII index was omitted in Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015) paper, but it is an important inconsistency index since it is the only extreme-based one. Therefore, now its properties are going to be proved. Proposition 12. KII satisfies Axiom 1. Proof: Is obvious from its definition. Proposition 13. KII satisfies Axiom 2. Proof: Since KII evaluates all triads in a pairwise comparison matrix, and finds the most inconsistent triad, the result does not depend on the order of alternatives. Proposition 14. KII satisfies Axiom 3.\nProof: Let 1b > and let 1ik ij jk\na x\na a \u2261 > (without the loss of generality) be the most inconsistent\ntriad. Then 1 1\nmin(1 , 1) 1KII x x x\n= \u2212 \u2212 = \u2212 . Now 1 b b ik\nij jk\na x\na a   \u2261 >    \nand ( ) 1\n1b b\nKII x = \u2212 .\nBecause 1b > , so 1 1 bx x > and ( )bKII KII> as required.\nProposition 15. KII satisfies Axiom 4.\nProof: Let ik\nij jk\na x\na a \u2261 denote the triad which is changed from a consistent state to an\ninconsistent one. In the consistent case 1ik\nij jk\na x\na a \u2261 = , otherwise 1ik\nij jk\na x\na a \u2261 < or\n1ik\nij jk\na x\na a \u2261 > . Let us assume (without loss of generality) that 1ik\nij jk\na x\na a \u2261 > . Then, (10)\nreduces to finding the minimum of 1\n1 , 1x x  \u2212 \u2212    . As 1 1 1x x \u2212 < \u2212 for 1x > , 11KII x = \u2212 and\n( ) 2 1\n` 0KII x = > ; thus KII is an increasing (monotone) function of ik ij jk\na x\na a \u2261 . The more the\ntriad goes inconsistent, the larger is KII as required. Proposition 16. KII satisfies Axiom 5. Proof: Is obvious from the definition of KII. Proposition 17. KII satisfies Axiom 6. Proof: From the definition of KII it is clear KII is bounded from above by the value of 1. Further, the indices introduced in the previous sections will be examined whether they satisfy the additional Axiom 6. Proposition 18. C.I. does not satisfy Axiom 6. Proof: Consider the corner pairwise comparison matrix of the order n. The characteristic polynomial of the matrix is: ( )( )3 2 1max max 2 2n n x x\u03bb \u03bb \u2212\u2212 = \u2212 + \u2212 , see Koczkodaj and Szwarc (2014). Since n N\u2208 and max n\u03bb \u2265 , we have: ( ) ( )3 3 2 1max max max 2 2n n x x\u03bb \u03bb \u03bb \u2212> \u2212 = \u2212 + \u2212 , and ( ) ( ) 1/31max 2 2n x x\u03bb \u2212 > \u2212 + \u2212  . From the last inequality for n fixed and for x \u2192 +\u221e we obtain max\u03bb \u2192 +\u221e , therefore C.I. is not bounded from above. Proposition 19. GWI satisfies Axiom 6. Proof: In GWI definition ( )ijA a is a normalized matrix with the sum of each column entries\nequal to 1. Let 1 1\n1 n n ij\ni j K a n = = = \u2211\u2211 . Certainly, K GWI> because 0iw \u2265 , { }1,2,...,i n\u2200 \u2208 . Now, K is the sum of n rows, each equal to one, hence K = 1 for all n. Therefore, K provides an upper bound for GWI as required. Proposition 20. PLI does not satisfy Axiom 6. Proof by counterexample: consider the corner pairwise comparison matrix of the order n = 3. Then, PLI = x + 1/x, which is not bounded from above. Proposition 21. GCI does not satisfy Axiom 6. Proof by counterexample: Consider the corner pairwise comparison matrix of the order n = 3.\nIn this case we get: 2 2 23 32\n1 1 2\nln ln ln w ww\nGCI x w w w\n      = + +     \n      . The first and the third terms are\nconstant, but the middle one is logarithmically increasing, and because the logarithmic function is not bounded from above, GCI is not bounded from above as well."}, {"heading": "6 Numerical example: a corner pairwise comparison matrix", "text": "To numerically illustrate behavior of selected indices, the corner pairwise comparison matrix C (see below) of the order n = 3 will be examined.

It should be noted that in this case PLI = x + 1/x. As can be seen from this comparison, RIC is the least increasing index, while PLI is the most increasing one. GCI, PLI, and C.I. grow almost linearly. KII index grows rapidly for small x (lower than 5), and then levels off.\nSource: author.\nConclusions The aim of the paper was to introduce a new measure (RIC) of inconsistency of a pairwise comparisons matrix based on the dot product of its row vectors. Furthermore, to the set of five axioms for inconsistency indices proposed by Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015), an additional sixth axiom (upper boundary of index\u2019s values) was added. New RIC index and Koczkodaj\u2019s index (KII) were examined with respect to these 6 axioms. Also, a (dis)satisfaction of the sixth axiom was proved for other indices, namely Saaty\u2019s C.I., Golden-Wang\u2019s Index, Geometric Consistency Index and Pel\u00e1ez-Lamata\u2019s Index. Koczkodaj\u2019s index was the only index satisfying all six axioms. Further study may focus on potential similarities among indices; see a comparative numerical study Brunelli et al. (2013), or an extension towards the fuzzy sets or the intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Also, theoretical studies on axiomatic systems for inconsistency indices would be of a considerable importance, as the axiomatic system proposed by Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015) is likely not the optimal one yet."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The paper was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic no. 14-02424S: \u201cMethods of operations research for the support of decision making under uncertainty\u201c."}], "references": [{"title": "The geometric consistency index: Approximated", "author": ["J Aguar\u00f3n", "M Moreno-Jimenez J"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Aguar\u00f3n and J,? \\Q2003\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Aguar\u00f3n and J", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Consistency in the analytic hierarchy process: a new approach", "author": ["A Alonso J", "T Lamata M"], "venue": "International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems, 14(4): 445-459.", "citeRegEx": "J and M,? 2006", "shortCiteRegEx": "J and M", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Consistency measures for pairwise comparison matrices", "author": ["J Barzilai"], "venue": "Journal of MultiCriteria Decision Analysis 7(3): 123\u2013132.", "citeRegEx": "Barzilai,? 1998", "shortCiteRegEx": "Barzilai", "year": 1998}, {"title": "Inconsistency indices for pairwise comparison matrices: a numerical study", "author": ["M Brunelli", "L Canal", "M Fedrizzi"], "venue": "Annals of Operations Research 211(1): 493-509", "citeRegEx": "Brunelli et al\\.,? 2013", "shortCiteRegEx": "Brunelli et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Axiomatic properties of inconsistency indices for pairwise comparisons", "author": ["M Brunelli", "M Fedrizzi"], "venue": "Journal of the Operational Research Society 66(1): 1-15.", "citeRegEx": "Brunelli and Fedrizzi,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Brunelli and Fedrizzi", "year": 2015}, {"title": "A general unified framework for pairwise comparison matrices in multicriterial methods", "author": ["B Cavallo", "L D\u2019Apuzzo"], "venue": "International Journal of Intelligent Systems", "citeRegEx": "Cavallo and D.Apuzzo,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Cavallo and D.Apuzzo", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Linear programming models for estimating weights in the analytic hierarchy process", "author": ["B Chandran", "B Golden", "E Wasil"], "venue": "Journal of Computers and Operations Research, 32(9): 2235-2254.", "citeRegEx": "Chandran et al\\.,? 2005", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chandran et al\\.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Remarks on the Analytic Hierarchy Process", "author": ["S Dyer J"], "venue": "Management Science, 36(3): 249-258.", "citeRegEx": "J,? 1990", "shortCiteRegEx": "J", "year": 1990}, {"title": "An alternate measure of consistency", "author": ["L Golden B", "Q Wang"], "venue": "In: Golden B L, Wasil E A and Harker P T (eds), The Analytic Hierarchy Process, Applications and studies, Springer-Verlag: Berlin\u2013Heidelberg: 68\u201381.", "citeRegEx": "B and Wang,? 1989", "shortCiteRegEx": "B and Wang", "year": 1989}, {"title": "How to derive priorities in AHP: a comparative study", "author": ["A Ishizaka", "M Lusti"], "venue": "Central European Journal of Operations Research, 14(4): 387-400.", "citeRegEx": "Ishizaka and Lusti,? 2006", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ishizaka and Lusti", "year": 2006}, {"title": "A new definition of consistency of pairwise comparisons", "author": ["W Koczkodaj"], "venue": "Mathematical and Computer Modeling 1993, 18(7): 79\u201384.", "citeRegEx": "Koczkodaj,? 1993", "shortCiteRegEx": "Koczkodaj", "year": 1993}, {"title": "The Limit of Inconsistency Reduction in Pairwise Comparisons", "author": ["W Koczkodaj", "J Szybowski"], "venue": "Int.
