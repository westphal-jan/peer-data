The second term g : Rd \u2192 R is the regularizer that promotes desired structures on the solution based on prior knowledge of the problem.\nIn practice, many problems of (P) are formulated, either naturally or intensionally, into a convex model to guarantee the tractability of algorithms. In particular, such convex problems can be efficiently minimized by many first-order algorithms, among which the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method (also referred to as FISTA (Beck & Teboulle, 2009b)) is proven to be the best for minimizing such class of convex functions. We present one of its basic forms in Algorithm 1. Compared to the usual proximal gradient step, the APG algorithm takes an extra linear extrapolation step for acceleration. It has been shown (Beck & Teboulle, 2009b) that the APG method reduces the function value gap at a rate of O(1/k2) where k denotes the number of iterations. This convergence rate meets the theoretical lower bound of first-order gradient methods for minimizing smooth convex functions. The reader can refer to (Tseng, 2010) for other variants of APG.\nAlthough convex problems are tractable and can be globally minimized, many applications naturally require to solve nonconvex optimization problems of (P). Recently, several variants of the APG method have been proposed for nonconvex problems, and two\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n04 92\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n4 M\nay 2\n01 7\nAlgorithm 2 Monotone APG (mAPG)\nInput: y1 = x1 = x0, t1 = 1, t0 = 0, \u03b7 < 1 L . for k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 do yk = xk +\ntk\u22121 tk (zk \u2212 xk) + tk\u22121\u22121tk (xk \u2212 xk\u22121). zk+1 = prox\u03b7g(yk \u2212 \u03b7\u2207f(yk)). vk+1 = prox\u03b7g(xk \u2212 \u03b7\u2207f(xk)).\ntk+1 =\n\u221a 4t2k+1+1\n2 . if F (zk+1) \u2264 F (vk+1) then\nxk+1 = zk+1, else if F (vk+1) \u2264 F (zk+1) then\nxk+1 = vk+1. end if\nend for\nAlgorithm 3 APG non-convex problem (APGnc)\nInput: y1 = x0, \u03b2k = k k+3 , \u03b7 < 1 L . for k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 do xk = prox\u03b7g(yk \u2212 \u03b7\u2207f(yk)). vk = xk + \u03b2k(xk \u2212 xk\u22121). if F (xk) \u2264 F (vk) then\nyk+1 = xk, else if F (vk) \u2264 F (xk) then\nyk+1 = vk. end if\nend for\nmajor ones are presented in Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3, respectively. The major difference to the original APG is that the modified methods only accept the new iterate when the corresponding function value is sufficiently decreased, which leads to a more stable convergence behavior. In particular, (Li & Lin, 2015) analyzed mAPG (Algorithm 2) by exploiting the Kurdyka- Lojasiewicz (K L) property, which is a local geometrical structure very generally held by a large class of nonconvex objective functions, and has been successfully exploited to characterize the asymptotic convergence behavior of many first order methods. It was shown in (Li & Lin, 2015) that mAPG achieves the O(1/k2) convergence rate for convex problems of (P), and converges to a critical point at sublinear and linear rates under different cases of the KL property for nonconvex problems. Despite the desirable convergence rate, mAPG requires two proximal steps, which doubles the computational complexity of the original APG. In comparison, the APGnc (Algorithm 3) requires only one proximal step, and hence computes faster than mAPG in each iteration. However, the analysis of APGnc in (Yao & Kwok, 2016) does not exploit the KL property and no convergence rate of the function value is established. Hence, there is still\nno formal theoretical comparison of the overall performance (which depends on both computation per iteration and convergence rate) between mAPG and APGnc. It is unclear whether the computational saving per iteration in APGnc is at the cost of lower convergence rate.\nThe goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the APGnc algorithm under the KL framework, thus establishing a rigorous comparison between mAPG and APGnc and formally justifying the overall advantage of APGnc."}, {"heading": "1.1. Main Contributions", "text": "This paper provides the convergence analysis of APGnc type algorithms for nonconvex problems of (P) under the KL framework as well as the inexact situation. We also study the stochastic variance reduced APGnc algorithm and its inexact situation. Our analysis requires novel technical treatments to exploit the K L property due to the joint appearance of the following ingredients in the algorithms including momentum terms, inexact errors, and stochastic variance reduced gradients. Our contributions are summarized as follows.\nFor APGnc applied to nonconvex problems of (P), we show that the limit points of the sequences generated by APGnc are critical points of the objective function. Then, by exploiting different cases of the KurdykaLojasiewicz property of the objective function, we establish the linear and sub-linear convergence rates of the function value sequence generated by APGnc. Our results formally show that APGnc (with one proximal map per iteration) achieves the same convergence properties as well as the convergence rates as mAPG (with two proximal maps per iteration) for nonconvex problems, thus establishing its overall computational advantage.\nWe further propose an APGnc+ algorithm, which is an improved version of APGnc by adapting the momentum stepsize (see Algorithm 4), and shares the same theoretical convergence rate as APGnc but numerically performs better than APGnc.\nFurthermore, we study the inexact APGnc in which the computation of the gradient and the proximal mapping may have errors. We show that the algorithm still achieves the convergence rate at the same order as the exact case as long as the inexactness is properly controlled. We also explicitly characterize the impact of errors on the constant factors that affect the convergence rate.\nTo facilitate the solution to large-scale optimization\nproblems, we study the stochastic variance reduced APGnc (SVRG-APGnc), and show that such an algorithm achieves linear convergence rate under a certain case of the K L property. We further analyze the inexact SVRG-APGnc and show that it also achieves the linear convergence under the same K L property as long as the error in the proximal mapping is bounded properly. This is the first analysis of the SVRG proximal algorithm with momentum that exploits the K L structure to establish linear convergence rate for nonconvex programming.\nOur numerical results further corroborate the theoretic analysis. We demonstrate that APGnc/APGnc+ outperforms APG and mAPG for nonconvex problems in both exact and inexact cases, and in both deterministic and stochastic variants of the algorithms. Furthermore, APGnc+ outperforms APGnc due to properly chosen momentum stepsize."}, {"heading": "1.2. Comparison to Related Work", "text": "APG algorithms: The original accelerated gradient method for minimizing a single smooth convex function dates back to (Nesterov, 1983), and is further extended as APG in the composite minimization framework in (Beck & Teboulle, 2009b; Tseng, 2010). While these APG variants generate a sequence of function values that may oscillate, (Beck & Teboulle, 2009a) proposed another variant of APG that generates a non-increasing sequence of function values. Then, (Li & Lin, 2015) further proposed an mAPG that generates a sufficiently decreasing sequence of function values, and established the asymptotic convergence rates under the K L property. Recently, (Yao & Kwok, 2016) proposed APGnc, which is a more efficient version of APG for nonconvex problems, but the analysis only characterizes fixed points and did not exploit the K L property to characterize the convegence rate. Our study establishes the convergence rate analysis of APGnc under the K L property.\nNonconvex optimization under K L: The K L property (Bolte et al., 2007) is an extension of the Lojasiewicz gradient inequality ( Lojasiewicz, 1965) to the nonsmooth case. Many first-order descent methods, under the K L property, can be shown to converge to a critical point (Attouch & Bolte, 2009; Attouch et al., 2010; Bolte et al., 2014) with different types of asymptotic convergence rates. (Li & Lin, 2015) and our paper focuses on the first-order algorithms with momentum, and respectively analyze mAPG and APGnc by exploiting the K L property.\nInexact algorithms under K L: (Attouch et al., 2013; Frankel et al., 2015) studied the inexact prox-\nimal algorithm under the K L property. This paper studies the inexact proximal algorithm with momentum (i.e., APGnc) under the K L property. While (Yao & Kwok, 2016) also studied the inexact APGnc, the analysis did not exploit the K L property to characterize the convergence rate.\nNonconvex SVRG: SVRG was first proposed in (Johnson & Zhang, 2013), to accelerate the stochastic gradient method for strongly convex objective functions, and was studied for the convex case in (Zhu & Yuan, 2016). Recently, SVRG was further studied for smooth nonconvex optimization in Reddi et al. (2016a). Then in (Reddi et al., 2016b), the proximal SVRG was proposed and studied for nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization. Our paper further incorporates SVRG for the proximal gradient with momentum in the nonconvex case. Furthermore, we exploit a certain K L property in our analysis that is very different from the PL property exploited in (Reddi et al., 2016a), and requires special technical treatment in convergence analysis."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries and Assumptions", "text": "In this section, we first introduce some technical definitions that are useful later on, and then describe the assumptions on the problem (P) that we take in this paper.\nThroughout this section, h : Rd \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e] is an extended real-valued function that is proper, i.e., its domain domh := {x \u2208 Rd : h(x) < \u221e} is nonempty, and is closed, i.e., its sublevel sets {x \u2208 Rd : h(x) \u2264 \u03b1} are closed for all \u03b1 \u2208 R. Note that a proper and closed function h can be nonsmooth and nonconvex, hence we consider the following generalized notion of derivative.\nDefinition 1 (Subdifferential, (Rockafellar & Wets, 1997)). The Freche\u0301t subdifferential \u2202\u0302h of h at x \u2208 domh is the set of u \u2208 Rd such that\nlim inf z6=x,z\u2192x\nh(z)\u2212h(x)\u2212u>(z\u2212x) \u2016z\u2212x\u2016 \u2265 0,\nwhile the (limiting) subdifferential \u2202h at x \u2208 domh is the graphical closure of \u2202\u0302h:\n{u : \u2203(xk, h(xk))\u2192 (x, h(x)), \u2202\u0302h(xk) 3 uk \u2192 u}.\nIn particular, this generalized derivative reduceds to \u2207h when h is continuously differentiable, and reduces to the usual subdifferential when h is convex.\nDefinition 2 (Critical point). A point x \u2208 Rd is a critical point of h iff 0 \u2208 \u2202h(x).\nDefinition 3 (Distance). The distance of a point x \u2208 Rd to a closed set \u2126 \u2286 Rd is defined as:\ndist\u2126(x) := miny\u2208\u2126 \u2016y \u2212 x\u2016. (1)\nDefinition 4 (Proximal map, e.g. (Rockafellar & Wets, 1997)). The proximal map of a point x \u2208 Rd under a proper and closed function h with parameter \u03b7 > 0 is defined as:\nprox\u03b7h(x) := argminz h(z) + 1 2\u03b7\u2016z\u2212 x\u2016 2, (2)\nwhere \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 is the Euclidean l2 norm.\nWe note that when h is convex, the corresponding proximal map is the minimizer of a strongly convex function, i.e., a singleton. But for nonconvex h, the proximal map can be set-valued, in which case prox\u03b7h(x) stands for an arbitrary element from that set. The proximal map is a popular tool to handle the nonsmooth part of the objective function, and is the key component of proximal-like algorithms (Beck & Teboulle, 2009b; Bolte et al., 2014).\nDefinition 5 (Uniformized K L property, (Bolte et al., 2014)). Function h is said to satisfy the uniformized K L property if for every compact set \u2126 \u2282 domh on which h is constant, there exist \u03b5, \u03bb > 0 such that for all x\u0304 \u2208 \u2126 and all x \u2208 {x \u2208 Rd : dist\u2126(x) < \u03b5} \u2229 [x : h(x\u0304) < h(x) < h(x\u0304) + \u03bb], one has\n\u03d5\u2032 (h(x)\u2212 h(x\u0304)) \u00b7 dist\u2202h(x)(0) \u2265 1, (3)\nwhere the function \u03d5 : [0, \u03bb) \u2192 R+ takes the form \u03d5(t) = c\u03b8 t \u03b8 for some constants c > 0, \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1].\nThe above definition is a modified version of the original K L property (Bolte et al., 2010; Kurdyka, 1998), and is more convenient for our analysis later. The K L property is a generalization of the Lojasiewicz gradient inequality to nonsmooth functions (Bolte et al., 2007), and it is a powerful tool to analyze a class of first-order descent algorithms (Attouch & Bolte, 2009; Attouch et al., 2010; Bolte et al., 2014). In particular, the class of semi-algebraic functions satisfy the above K L property. This function class covers most objective functions in real applications, for instance, all lp where p \u2265 0 and is rational, real polynomials, rank, etc. For a more detailed discussion and a list of examples of K L functions, see (Bolte et al., 2014) and (Attouch et al., 2010).\nWe adopt the following assumptions on the problem (P) in this paper.\nAssumption 1. Regarding the functions f, g (and F = f + g) in (P)\n1. They are proper and lower semicontinous; infx\u2208Rd F (x) > \u2212\u221e; the sublevel set {x \u2208 Rd : F (x) \u2264 \u03b1} is bounded for all \u03b1 \u2208 R; 2. They satisfy the uniformized K L property; 3. Function f is continuously differentiable and the\ngradient \u2207f is L-Lipschitz continuous.\nNote that the sublevel set of F is bounded when either f or g has bounded sublevel set, i.e., f(x) or g(x) \u2192 +\u221e as \u2016x\u2016 \u2192 +\u221e. Of course, we do not assume convexity on either f or g, and the K L property serves as an alternative in this general setting."}, {"heading": "3. Main Results", "text": "In this section, we provide our main results on the convergence analysis of APGnc and SVRG-APGnc as well as inexact variants of these algorithms. All proofs of the theorems are provided in supplemental materials."}, {"heading": "3.1. Convergence Analysis", "text": "In this subsection, we characterize the convergence of APGnc. Our first result characterizes the behavior of the limit points of the sequence generated by APGnc.\nTheorem 1. Let Assumption 1.{1,3} hold for the problem (P). Then with stepsize \u03b7 < 1L , the sequence {xk} generated by APGnc satisfies\n1. {xk} is a bounded seuqence; 2. The set of limit points \u2126 of {xk} forms a compact\nset, on which the objective function F is constant; 3. All elements of \u2126 are critical points of F .\nTheorem 1 states that the sequence {xk} generated by APGnc eventually approaches a compact set (i.e., a closed and bounded set in Rd) of critical points, and the objective function remains constant on it. Here, approaching critical points establishes the first step for solving general nonconvex problems. Moreover, the compact set \u2126 meets the requirements of the uniform K L property, and hence provides a seed to exploit the K L property around it. Next, we further utilize the K L property to establish the asymptotic convergence rate for APGnc. In the following theorem, \u03b8 is the parameter in the uniformized K L property via the function \u03d5 that takes the form \u03d5(t) = c\u03b8 t\n\u03b8 for some c > 0, \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1].

An illustrative example for the first kind (\u03b8 = 1) can take a form similar to F (x) = |x| for x \u2208 R around the critical points. The function is \u2018sharp\u2019 around its critical point x = 0 and thus the iterates slide down quickly onto it within finite steps. For the second kind (\u03b8 \u2208 [ 12 , 1)), example functions can take a form similar to F (x) = x2 around the critical points. That is, the function is strongly convex-like and hence the convergence rate is typically linear. Lastly, functions of the third kind are \u2018flat\u2019 around its critical points and thus the convergence is slowed down to sub-linear rate. We note that characterizing the value of \u03b8 for a given function is a highly non-trivial problem that takes much independent effort (Kurdyka & Spodzieja, 2011; Li & Kei, 2016). Nevertheless, K L property provides a general picture of the asymptotic convergence behaviors of APGnc."}, {"heading": "3.2. APGnc with Adaptive Momentum", "text": "The original APGnc sets the momentum parameter \u03b2k = k k+3 , which can be theoretically justified only for convex problems. We here propose an alternative choice of the momentum stepsize that is more intuitive for nonconvex problems, and refer to the resulting algorithm as APGnc+ (See Algorithm 4). The idea is to enlarge the momentum \u03b2 to further exploit the opportunity of acceleration when the extrapolation step vk achieves a lower function value. Since the proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 do not depend on the exact value of the momentum stepsize, APGnc and APGnc+ have the same order-level convergence rate.

(4)\nThe inexact proximal algorithm has been studied in (Attouch et al., 2013) for nonconvex functions under the K L property. Our study here is the first treatment of inexact proximal algorithms with momentum (i.e., APG-like algorithms). Furthermore, previous studies addressed only the inexactness of gradient computation for nonconvex problems, but our study here also includes the inexactness of the proximal map for nonconvex problems requiring only g to be convex as the second case we specify below.\nWe study the following two cases.\n1. g is convex; 2. g is nonconvex, and = 0.\nIn the first case, \u2202g(x) reduces to the usual subdifferential of convex functions, and the inexactness naturally induces the following -subdifferential\n\u2202 g(x) = {u | g(y) \u2265 g(x) + \u3008y \u2212 x,u\u3009 \u2212 , \u2200y \u2208 Rd}.\nMoreover, since the K L property utilizes the information of \u2202F , we then need to characterize the perturbation of \u2202g under the inexactness . This leads to the following definition. Definition 6. For any x \u2208 Rd, let u\u2032 \u2208 \u2202 g(x) such that \u2207f(x) + u\u2032 has the minimal norm. Then the perturbation between \u2202g and \u2202 g is defined as \u03be := dist\u2202g(x)(u \u2032).\nThe following theorem states that for nonconvex functions, as long as the inexactness parameters ek, k and \u03bek are properly controlled, then the inexact APGnc converges at the same order-level rate as the corresponding exact algorithm.\nTheorem 3. Consider the above two cases for inexact APGnc under Assumption 1.{1,2,3}.

Correspondingly, a smaller stepsize \u03b7 < 12C+L should be used.\nIt can be seen that, due to the inexactness, the constant factor d1 in Theorem 2 is enlarged, which further leads to a smaller d2 in Theorem 2. Hence, the corresponding convergence rates are slower compared to the exact case, but remain at the same order."}, {"heading": "3.4. Stochastic Variance Reduced APGnc", "text": "In this subsection, we study the stochastic variance reduced APGnc algorithm, referred to as SVRG-APGnc. The main steps are presented in Algorithm 5. The major difference from APGnc is that the single proximal gradient step is replaced by a loop of stochastic proximal gradient steps using variance reduced gradients.\nDue to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, the iterate sequence may not stably stay in the local K L region, and hence the standard K L approach fails. We then focus on the analysis of the special but important case of the global K L property with \u03b8 = 12 . In fact, if g = 0, the K L property in such a case reduces to the well known Polyak- Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality studied in (Karimi et al., 2016). Various nonconvex problems have been shown to satisfy this property such as quadratic phase retrieval loss function (Zhou et al., 2016) and neural network loss function (Hardt & Ma, 2016). The following theorem characterizes the convergence rate of SVRG-APGnc under the K L property with \u03b8 = 12 . Theorem 4. Let \u03b7 = \u03c1/L, where \u03c1 < 1/2 and satisfies 4\u03c12m2 + \u03c1 \u2264 1. If the problem (P) satisfies the K L property globally with \u03b8 = 1/2, then the sequence {yk} generated by Algorithm 5 satisfies\nE [F (yk)\u2212 F \u2217] \u2264 ( d d+1 )k (F (y0)\u2212 F \u2217) , (8)\nwhere d = c2(L+ 1\u03b7 ) 2 +\u03b7L2m\n1 2\u03b7\u2212L\n, and F \u2217 is the optimal func-\ntion value.\nHence, SVRG-APGnc also achieves the linear convergence rate under the K L property with \u03b8 = 12 .

Here, we focus on the case where g is convex and ek = 0. The following theorem characterizes the convergence rate under such an inexact case.\nTheorem 5. Let g be convex and consider only the inexactness in the proximal map. Assume the K L property is globally satisfied with \u03b8 = 1/2.

To incor-\nporate the K L property in deriving the convergence rate, we use a reference sequence generated by exact proximal mapping. Even though this sequence is not actually generated by the algorithm, we can reach to the convergence rate by analyzing the relation between the reference sequence and the actual sequence generated by the algorithm.\nCompared to the exact case, the convergence rate remains at the same order, i.e., the linear convergence, but the convergence is slower due to the larger parameter d caused by the error parameter \u03b1."}, {"heading": "4. Experiments", "text": "In this section, we compare the efficiency of APGnc and SVRG-APGnc with other competitive methods via numerical experiments.

All samples are then normalized to have unit norm. The initialization is randomly generated, and is applied to all the methods.

Comparison among APG variants", "text": "We first compare among the deterministic APG-like methods in Algorithms 2 - 4 and the standard proximal gradient method. The original APG in Algorithm 1 is not considered since it is not a descent method and does not have convergence guarantee in nonconvex cases. We use a fixed step size \u03b7 = 0.05/L, where\nL is the spectral norm of the sample matrix n\u2211 i=1 ziz T i . We set t = 1/2 for APGnc+. The results are shown in Figures 1 and 2. In Figure 1 (a), we show the performance comparison of the methods when there is no error in gradient or proximal calculation. One can see that APGnc and APGnc+ outperform all other APG variants. In particular, APGnc+ performs the best with our adaptive momentum strategy, justifying its empirical advantage. We note that the mAPG requires two passes over all samples at each iteration, and is, therefore, less data efficient compared to other APG variants.\nWe further study the inexact case in Figure 1 (b), where we introduce the proximal error k = 1 100k3 at the kth iteration. One can see that inexact APGnc+ and inexact APGnc also outperform other two inexact algorithms. Furthermore, in Figure 2 (a) and (b), we compare exact and inexact algorithms respectively for APGnc+ and APGnc. It can been that even with a reasonable amount of inexactness, both methods converge comparably to their corresponding exact methods. Although initially the function value drops faster in exact algorithms, both exact and inexact algorithms converge to the optimal point almost at the same time. Such a fact demonstrates the robustness of the algorithms."}, {"heading": "4.2.

The results are presented in Figures 3 and 4. In the error free case in Figure 3 (a), one can see that SVRG-AGPnc+ method outperforms the others due to the adaptive momentum, and the SVRG-APGnc method also performs better than the original proximal SVRG method.\nFor the inexact case, we set the proximal error as k = min( 1100k3 , 10\n\u22127). One can see from Figure 3 (b) that the performance is degraded compared to the exact case, and converges to a different local minimum. In this result, all the methods are no longer monotone due to the inexactness and the stochastic nature of SVRG. Nevertheless, the SVRG-APGnc+ still yields the best performance.\nWe also compare the results corresponding to SVRGAPGnc+ and SVRG-APGnc, with and without the proximal error, in Figure 4 (a) and (b), respectively. It is clear that the SVRG-based algorithms are much more sensitive to the error comparing with APG-based ones. Even though the error is set to be smaller than in the inexact case with APG-based methods, one can observe more significant performance gaps than those in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we provided comprehensive analysis of the convergence properties of APGnc as well as its inexact and stochastic variance reduced forms by exploiting the K L property.

We showed that APGnc shares the same convergence guarantee and the same order of convergence rate as the mAPG, but is computationally more efficient and more amenable to adaptive momentum. In order to exploit the K L property for accelerated algorithms in the situations with inexact errors and/or with stochastic variance reduced gradients, we developed novel convergence analysis techniques, which can be useful for exploring other algorithms for nonconvex problems."}], "references": [{"title": "On the convergence of the proximal algorithm for nonsmooth functions involving analytic features", "author": ["H.
