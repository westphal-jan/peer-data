When major languages such as English or French are adopted in another culture as the primary language, they often mix with existing languages or dialects in that culture and evolve into a stable language called a creole. Examples of creoles include the French-based Haitian Creole, and Colloquial Singaporean English (Singlish) (MianLian and Platt, 1993), an English-based creole. While the majority of the natural language processing (NLP) research attention has been focused on the major languages, little work has been done on adapting the components to creoles. One notable body of work originated from the featured\ntranslation task of the EMNLP 2011 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT11) to translate Haitian Creole SMS messages sent during the 2010 Haitian earthquake. This work highlights the importance of NLP tools on creoles in crisis situations for emergency relief (Hu et al., 2011; Hewavitharana et al., 2011).\nSinglish is one of the major languages in Singapore, with borrowed vocabulary and grammars1 from a number of languages including Malay, Tamil, and Chinese dialects such as Hokkien, Cantonese and Teochew (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011), and it has been increasingly used in written forms on web media. Fluent English speakers unfamiliar with Singlish would find the creole hard to comprehend (Harada, 2009). Correspondingly, fundamental English NLP components such as POS taggers and dependency parsers perform poorly on such Singlish texts as shown in Table 2 and 4. For example, Seah et al. (2015) adapted the Socher et al. (2013) sentiment analysis engine to the Singlish vocabulary, but failed to adapt the parser. Since dependency parsers are important for tasks such as information extraction (Miwa and Bansal, 2016) and discourse parsing (Li et al., 2015), this hinders the development of such downstream applications for Singlish in written forms and thus makes it crucial to build a dependency parser that can perform well natively on Singlish.\nTo address this issue, we start with investigating the linguistic characteristics of Singlish and specifically the causes of difficulties for understanding Singlish with English syntax. We found that, despite the obvious attribute of inheriting a large portion of basic vocabularies and grammars from English, Singlish not only imports terms from regional languages and dialects, its lexical\n1We follow Leimgruber (2011) in using \u201cgrammar\u201d to describe \u201csyntactic constructions\u201d and we do not differentiate the two expressions in this paper.\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n06 46\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n8 M\nay 2\n01 7\nsemantics and syntax also deviate significantly from English (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011). We categorize the challenges and formalize their interpretation using Universal Dependencies (Nivre et al., 2016), which extends to the creation of a Singlish dependency treebank with 1,200 sentences.\nBased on the intricate relationship between Singlish and English, we build a Singlish parser by leveraging knowledge of English syntax as a basis. This overall approach is illustrated in Figure 1. In particular, we train a basic Singlish parser with the best off-the-shelf neural dependency parsing model using biaffine attention (Dozat and Manning, 2017), and improve it with knowledge transfer by adopting neural stacking (Chen et al., 2016; Zhang and Weiss, 2016) to integrate the English syntax. Since POS tags are important features for dependency parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014; Dyer et al., 2015), we train a POS tagger for Singlish following the same idea by integrating English POS knowledge using neural stacking.\nResults show that English syntax knowledge brings 51.50% and 25.01% relative error reduction on POS tagging and dependency parsing respectively, resulting in a Singlish dependency parser with 84.47% unlabeled attachment score (UAS) and 77.76% labeled attachment score (LAS).\nWe make our Singlish dependency treebank, the source code for training a dependency parser and the trained model for the parser with the best performance freely available online2.\n2https://github.com/wanghm92/Sing_Par"}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Neural networks have led to significant advance in the performance for dependency parsing, including transition-based parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014; Zhou et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2015; Dyer et al., 2015; Ballesteros et al., 2015; Andor et al., 2016), and graph-based parsing (Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016; Dozat and Manning, 2017). In particular, the biaffine attention method of Dozat and Manning (2017) uses deep bi-directional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) networks for highorder non-linear feature extraction, producing the highest-performing graph-based English dependency parser. We adopt this model as the basis for our Singlish parser.\nOur work belongs to a line of work on transfer learning for parsing, which leverages English resources in Universal Dependencies to improve the parsing accuracies of low-resource languages (Hwa et al., 2005; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Ganchev et al., 2009). Seminal work employed statistical models. McDonald et al. (2011) investigated delexicalized transfer, where word-based features are removed from a statistical model for English, so that POS and dependency label knowledge can be utilized for training a model for lowresource language. Subsequent work considered syntactic similarities between languages for better feature transfer (Ta\u0308ckstro\u0308m et al., 2012; Naseem et al., 2012; Zhang and Barzilay, 2015).\nRecently, a line of work leverages neural network models for multi-lingual parsing (Guo et al., 2015; Duong et al., 2015; Ammar et al., 2016). The basic idea is to map the word embedding spaces between different languages into the same vector space, by using sentence-aligned bilingual data. This gives consistency in tokens, POS and dependency labels thanks to the availability of Universal Dependencies (Nivre et al., 2016). Our work is similar to these methods in using a neural network model for knowledge sharing between different languages. However, ours is different in the use of a neural stacking model, which respects the distributional differences between Singlish and English words. This empirically gives higher accuracies for Singlish.\nNeural stacking was previously used for cross-annotation (Chen et al., 2016) and crosstask (Zhang and Weiss, 2016) joint-modelling on monolingual treebanks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ it on cross-lingual\nfeature transfer from resource-rich languages to improve dependency parsing for low-resource languages. Besides these three dimensions in dealing with heterogeneous text data, another popular area of research is on the topic of domain adaption, which is commonly associated with crosslingual problems (Nivre et al., 2007). While this large strand of work is remotely related to ours, we do not describe them in details.\nUnsupervised rule-based approaches also offer an competitive alternative for cross-lingual dependency parsing (Naseem et al., 2010; Gillenwater et al., 2010; Gelling et al., 2012; S\u00f8gaard, 2012a,b; Mart\u0131\u0301nez Alonso et al., 2017), and recently been benchmarked for the Universal Dependencies formalism by exploiting the linguistic constraints in the Universal Dependencies to improve the robustness against error propagation and domain adaption (Mart\u0131\u0301nez Alonso et al., 2017). However, we choose a data-driven supervised approach given the relatively higher parsing accuracy owing to the availability of resourceful treebanks from the Universal Dependencies project."}, {"heading": "3 Singlish Dependency Treebank", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Universal Dependencies for Singlish", "text": "Since English is the major genesis of Singlish, we choose English as the source of lexical feature transfer to assist Singlish dependency parsing. Universal Dependencies provides a set of multilingual treebanks with cross-lingually consistent dependency-based lexicalist annotations, designed to aid development and evaluation for cross-lingual systems, such as multilingual parsers (Nivre et al., 2016). The current version of Universal Dependencies comprises not only major treebanks for 47 languages but also their siblings for domain-specific corpora and dialects. With the aligned initiatives for creating transfer-learning-friendly treebanks, we adopt the Universal Dependencies protocol for constructing the Singlish dependency treebank, both as a new resource for the low-resource languages and to facilitate knowledge transfer from English.\nOn top of the general Universal Dependencies guidelines, English-specific dependency relation definitions including additional subtypes are employed as the default standards for annotating the Singlish dependency treebank, unless augmented or redefined when necessary. The latest English\ncorpus in Universal Dependencies v1.43 collection is constructed from the English Web Treebank (Bies et al., 2012), comprising of web media texts, which potentially smooths the knowledge transfer to our target Singlish texts in similar domains. The statistics of this dataset, from which we obtain English syntactic knowledge, is shown in Table 1 and we refer to this corpus as UD-Eng. This corpus uses 47 dependency relations and we show below how to conform to the same standard while adapting to unique Singlish grammars."}, {"heading": "3.2 Challenges and Solutions for Annotating Singlish", "text": "The deviations of Singlish from English come from both the lexical and the grammatical levels (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011), which bring challenges for analysis on Singlish using English NLP tools. The former involves imported vocabularies from the first languages of the local people and the latter can be represented by a set of relatively localized features which collectively form 5 unique grammars of Singlish according to Leimgruber (2011). We find empirically that all these deviations can be accommodated by applying the existing English dependency relation definitions while ensuring consistency with the annotations in other non-English UD treebanks, which are explained with examples as follows.\nImported vocabulary: Singlish borrows a number of words and expressions from its nonEnglish origins (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011), such as \u201cKiasu\u201d, which originates from Hokkien meaning \u201cvery anxious not to miss an opportunity\u201d.4 These imported terms often constitute out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with respect to a standard English treebank and result in difficulties for using English-trained tools on Singlish. All borrowed words are annotated based on their usages in Singlish, which mainly inherit the POS from their genesis languages. Table A4 in Appendix A\n3Only guidelines for Universal Dependencies v2 but not the English corpus is available when this work is completed.\n4Definition by the Oxford living Dictionaries for English.\nsummarizes all borrowed terms in our treebank. Topic-prominence: This type of sentences start with establishing its topic, which often serves as the default one that the rest of the sentence refers to, and they typically employ an object-subjectverb sentence structure (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011). In particular, three subtypes of topic-prominence are observed in the Singlish dependency treebank and their annotations are addressed as follows:\nFirst, topics framed as clausal arguments at the beginning of the sentence are labeled as \u201ccsubj\u201d (clausal subject), as shown by \u201cDrive this car\u201d of (1) in Figure 2, which is consistent with the dependency relations in its Chinese translation.\nSecond, noun phrases used to modify the predicate with the absence of a preposition is regarded as a \u201cnsubj\u201d (nominal subject). Similarly, this is a common order of words used in Chinese and one example is the \u201cSG\u201d of (2) in Figure 2.\nThird, prepositional phrases moved in front are still treated as \u201cnmod\u201d (nominal modifier) of their\nintended heads, following the exact definition but as a Singlish-specific form of exemplification, as shown by the \u201cInside tent\u201d of (3) in Figure 2.\nAlthough the \u201cdislocated\u201d (dislocated elements) relation in UD is also used for preposed elements, but it captures the ones \u201cthat do not fulfill the usual core grammatical relations of a sentence\u201d and \u201cnot for a topic-marked noun that is also the subject of the sentence\u201d (Nivre et al., 2016). In these three scenarios, the topic words or phrases are in relatively closer grammatical relations to the predicate, as subjects or modifiers.\nCopula deletion: Imported from the corresponding Chinese sentence structure, this copula verb is often optional and even deleted in Singlish, which is one of its diagnostic characteristics (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011). In UD-Eng standards, predicative \u201cbe\u201d is the only verb used as a copula and it often depends on its complement to avoid copular head. This is explicitly designed in UD to promote parallelism for zero-copula phenomenon in languages such as Russian, Japanese, and Arabic. The deleted copula and its \u201ccop\u201d (copula) arcs are simply ignored, as shown by (4) in Figure 2.\nNP deletion: Noun-phrase (NP) deletion often results in null subjects or objects. It may be regarded as a branch of \u201cTopic-prominence\u201d but is a distinctive feature of Singlish with relatively high frequency of usage (Leimgruber, 2011). NP deletion is also common in pronoun-dropping languages such as Spanish and Italian, where the anaphora can be morphologically inferred. In one example, \u201cVorrei ora entrare brevemente nel merito.\u201d5, from the Italian treebank in UD, \u201cVorrei\u201d means \u201cI would like to\u201d and depends on the sentence root, \u201centrare\u201d, with the \u201caux\u201d(auxiliary) relation, where the subject \u201cI\u201d is absent but implicitly understood. Similarly, we do not recover such relations since the deleted NP imposes negligible alteration to the dependency tree, as exemplified by (5) in Figure 2.\nInversion: Inversion in Singlish involves either keeping the subject and verb in interrogative sentences in the same order as in statements, or tag questions in polar interrogatives (Leimgruber, 2011). The former also exists in non-English languages, such as Spanish and Italian, where the subject can prepose the verb in questions (La-\n5In English: (I) would now like to enter briefly on the merit (of the discussion).\nhousse and Lamiroy, 2012). This simply involves a change of word orders and thus requires no special treatments. On the other hand, tag questions should be carefully analyzed in two scenarios. One type is in the form of \u201cisn\u2019t it?\u201d or \u201chaven\u2019t you?\u201d, which are dependents of the sentence root with the \u201cparataxis\u201d relation.6 The other type is exemplified as \u201cright?\u201d, and its Singlish equivalent \u201ctio boh?\u201d (a transliteration from Hokkien) are labeled with the \u201cdiscourse\u201d (discourse element) relation with respect to the sentence root. See example (6) in Figure 2.\nDiscourse particles: Usage of clausal-final discourse particles, which originates from Hokkien and Cantonese, is one of the most typical feature of Singlish (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011; Lim, 2007). All discourse particles that appear in our treebank are summarized in Table A3 in Appendix A with the imported vocabulary:. These words express the tone of the sentence and thus have the \u201cINTJ\u201d (interjection) POS tag and depend on the root of the sentence or clause labeled with \u201cdiscourse\u201d, as is shown by the \u201cleh\u201d of (3) in Figure 2. The word \u201cone\u201d is a special instance of this type with the sole purpose being a tone marker in Singlish but not English, as shown by (7) in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "3.3 Data Selection and Annotation", "text": "Data Source: Singlish is used in written form mainly in social media and local Internet forums. After comparison, we chose the SG Talk Forum7 as our data source due to its relative abundance in Singlish contents. We crawled 84,459 posts using the Scrapy framework8 from pages dated up to 25th December 2016, retaining sentences of length between 5 and 50, which total 58,310. Sentences are reversely sorted according to the log likelihood of the sentence given by an English language model trained using the KenLM toolkit (Heafield et al., 2013)9 normalized by the sentence length, so that those most different from standard English can be chosen. Among the top 10,000 sentences, 1,977 sentences contain unique Singlish vocabularies defined by The\n6In UD: Relation between the main verb of a clause and other sentential elements, such as sentential parenthetical clause, or adjacent sentences without any explicit coordination or subordination.\n7http://sgTalk.com 8https://scrapy.org/ 9Trained using the afp eng and xin eng sources of English\nGigaword Fifth Edition (Gigaword).\nCoxford Singlish Dictionary10, A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English11, and the Singlish Vocabulary Wikipedia page12. The average normalized log likelihood of these 10,000 sentences is -5.81, and the same measure for all sentences in UD-Eng is -4.81. This means these sentences with Singlish contents are 10 times less probable expressed as standard English than the UD-Eng contents in the web domain. This contrast indicates the degree of lexical deviation of Singlish from English. We chose 1,200 sentences from the first 10,000. More than 70% of the selected sentences are observed to consist of the Singlish grammars and imported vocabularies described in section 3.2. Thus the evaluations on this treebank can reflect the performance of various POS taggers and parsers on Singlish in general.\nAnnotation: The chosen texts are divided by random selection into training, development, and testing sets according to the proportion of sentences in the training, development, and test division for UD-Eng, as summarized in Table 1. The sentences are tokenized using the NLTK Tokenizer,13 and then annotated using the Dependency Viewer.14 In total, all 17 UD-Eng POS tags and 41 out of the 47 UD-Eng dependency labels are present in the Singlish dependency treebank.

This suggests that the base English parser mainly contributes to analyzing basic English syntax, while the base Singlish parser models unique Singlish grammars better.\nSimilar trends are also observed on the base model using the English Giga100M embeddings, but the overall performances are not as good as\n19Multiple labels are allowed for one sentence. 20The \u201cInversion\u201d type of grammar is not analyzed since\nthere is only 1 such sentence in the test set.\nusing ICE-SIN embeddings, especially over basic English syntax where it undermines the performance to a greater extent. This suggests that only limited English distributed lexical semantic information can be integrated to help modelling Singlish syntactic knowledge due to the differences in distributed lexical semantics."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We have investigated dependency parsing for Singlish, an important English-based creole language, through annotations of a Singlish dependency treebank with 10,986 words and building an enhanced parser by leveraging on knowledge transferred from a 20-times-bigger English treebank of Universal Dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using neural stacking for feature transfer by boosting the Singlish dependency parsing performance to from UAS 79.29% to UAS 84.47%, with a 25.01% relative error reduction over the parser with all available Singlish resources. We release the annotated Singlish dependency treebank, the trained model and the source code for the parser with free public access. Possible future work include expanding the investigation to other regional languages such as Malay and Indonesian."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Yue Zhang is the corresponding author.
