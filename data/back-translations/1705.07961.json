This result led afterwards to other extension theorems [3], [4], [11], [21]. Szpilrajn\u2019s theorem and other extension theorems derived from economics have been intensely used in the classical choice theory [20], [22], [26].\nAs known, rationality is one of the main attributes which are taken into account in the analysis of economic decisions. An agent chooses between different alternatives; the rationality of the act of choice is defined by a preference relation acting on the alternatives. According to the context, the preference relation must satisfy some properties. Among these, transitivity acts extremely prolifically in classical consumer theory [20], [21], [22]. Still there exist situations when transitivity is a too strong condition. The notion of consistency was introduced by Suzumura in [21] in order to weaken transitivity.\nIn choice theory two types of extension relations appear. The first one represents merely the inclusion: \u201drelationQ extends relation R\u201d means that R \u2286 Q. If we interpret a relation as expressing the preference between alternatives, this type of extension preserves the preference. The second type of extension is determined by two inclusions: \u201drelation Q extends relation R\u201d if R \u2286 Q and PR \u2286 PQ (here, PR, PQ are the asymmetric parts of R, Q). Since the\nasymmetric part PR is interpreted as the strict preference, it follows that these extensions preserve the preference and the strict preference. For the second type extensions, Duggan [10] uses the notion \u201dcompatible extensions\u201d. Suzumura\u2019s theorem [21] links the consistency with the compatible extensions: a relation is consistent iff it admits a total and transitive compatible extension.\nIn [10] Duggan establishes a very general result which encompasses the theorems of Szpilrajn [23], Hansson [17], Suzumura [21], Dushnik\u2013Miller [11] and Donaldson\u2013Weymark [9] and other new particular cases. Duggan\u2019s theorem provides total compatible extensions for various classes of crisp relations.\nPaper [13] has been an attempt to obtain for fuzzy relations a result similar to Duggan\u2019s extension theorem. In the setting of fuzzy sets theory associated with the Go\u0308del t-norm [16] a concept of compatible extension of a fuzzy relation and one of consistent fuzzy relation (transitive\u2013consistent in the terminology of [4], [13]) have been defined. The main result of [13] is an extension theorem for fuzzy relations which generalizes Proposition 9 from [10]. As particular cases fuzzy versions of Szpilrajn, Hansson and Suzumura theorems have been obtained.\nIn defining the meaning of compatible extension of a fuzzy relation R the asymmetric part of R, PR comes in, notion in whose expression appears the negation corresponding to the Go\u0308del t-norm. Since this negation takes only the values 0 and 1, an important part of the information on the fuzzy preference relation R (therefore on the act of choice) is lost.\nThis paper aims to define a concept of compatible extension which should avoid the negation. One starts from the remark that, in the classical case, the definition of the compatible extension and of the consistency can be done in terms of the Boolean implication (see Lemma 4.2). This fact suggests the definition of the \u2217\u2013compatible extension, concept which is expressed using only the residuum \u2192 associated with a left\u2013continuous t\u2013norm \u2217 (see [16], [18]). Accordingly, we shall also obtain a notion of \u2217\u2013consistency.\nOnce done this step, this idea is to redo in a fuzzy context the proof of Duggan\u2019s theorem, by essentially using the structure of residuated lattice of the interval [0, 1].\nIn Section 2 the main extension theorems are recalled: Szpilrajn, Hansson, Suzumura, Dushnik-Miller and Donaldson\u2013Weymark and also Duggan\u2019s General Extension Theorem. It is separately stated (Theorem 2.4) that part of Duggan\u2019s results which constitutes the generalization of the theorems of Szpilrajn, Hansson and Suzumura. Section 3 presents some definitions and properties of left\u2013continuous t\u2013norms, the associated residuation structure and the fuzzy relations.\nSection 4 is the core of the paper. For a left\u2013continuous t\u2013norm \u2217 we define the concepts of \u2217\u2013compatible extension and \u2217\u2013consistent fuzzy relation. If \u2217 is the Go\u0308del t-norm \u2227, then any \u2227\u2013compatible extension is compatible (in the sense of [13]) but the converse does not hold. The main results are two extension theorems. Both are fuzzy extensions of Theorem 2.4. The first one is stated in the framework offered by a left\u2013continuous t\u2013norm. One proved that if the \u2217\u2013compatibility of the fuzzy relations is \u201dtransitive\u201d then the fuzzy version of\nTheorem 2.4 is valid. For the Go\u0308del t-norm, this property is verified. One obtains then the second extension theorem, which is exactly the fuzzy form of Theorem 2.4 for the Go\u0308del t-norm.\nSection 5 concerns some particular cases of extension theorems. In Section 6 to each fuzzy relation R on X one associates two fuzzy relations R\u2206 and R\u2207 1 . R\u2206 and R\u2207 are in general different, but both extend the notion of consistent closure of a crisp relation [3]. For the Go\u0308del t-norm we have R\u2206 = R\u2207 and this is the smallest \u2227\u2013consistent fuzzy relation on X including R."}, {"heading": "2 Classical extension theorems", "text": "In this section the extension theorems of Szpilrajn, Hansson, Suzumura, DushnikMiller and Donaldson\u2013Weymark are recalled. The extension theorem of Duggan is a very general result which encompasses all these theorems.\nConsider a universe X of alternatives and a (crisp) binary relation R on X . The binary relation PR = {(x, y)|(x, y) \u2208 R and (y, x) /\u2208 R} is called the asymmetric part of R. We denote by T (R) the transitive closure of R (the smallest transitive relation containing R). A preorder (resp. weak order) on X is a reflexive and transitive (resp. reflexive, transitive and total) relation on X . If a relation R on X is irreflexive and transitive then it is called a strict partial order on X ; a strict partial order is called strict total order if it is total.\nLet R,Q be two relations on X . Q is called an extension (resp. a compatible extension) of R if R \u2286 Q (resp. R \u2286 Q and PR \u2286 PQ). R is a consistent relation if T (R) is a compatible extension of R, i.e. PR \u2286 PT (R). Of course a transitive relation is consistent but the converse assertion is not true.\nTheorem 2.1 [23] (Szpilrajn) Any strict partial order on X can be extended to a strict total order on X.\nTheorem 2.2 [17] (Hansson) Any preorder on X can be extended to a total preorder on X.\nTheorem 2.3 [21] (Suzumura) A relation on X has a total, transitive and compatible extension iff it is consistent.\nFor any relation R and x, y \u2208 X denote R[x, y] = R \u222a {(x, y)}.

Therefore in the construction of the models of fuzzy uncertainty situations it is indicated to avoid the use of the Go\u0308del t-norm.\nNow we fix a left\u2013continuous t\u2013norm \u2217. A fuzzy relation on a universe X of alternatives is a fuzzy subset of X2, i.e. a function R : X2 \u2192 [0, 1]. R will be interpreted as a fuzzy preference relation: for any alternatives x, y, R(x, y) is the degree to which it is true that x is at least as good as y. If R,Q are two fuzzy relations on X then Q is an extension of R if R \u2286 Q. The relation R on X is said to be\n\u2022 reflexive if R(x, x) = 1 for any x \u2208 X ; \u2022 irreflexive if R(x, x) = 0 for any x \u2208 X ; \u2022 \u2217\u2013transitive if R(x, y) \u2217R(y, z) \u2264 R(x, z) for all x, y, z \u2208 X ; \u2022 total if R(x, y) > 0 or R(y, x) > 0 for all distinct x, y \u2208 X ; \u2022 strongly total if R(x, y) = 1 or R(y, x) = 1 for all distinct x, y \u2208 X . The \u2217\u2013transitive closure T (R) of R is the intersection of all \u2217\u2013transitive\nextensions of R.\nRemark 3.5 From the above definitions one can see that the \u2217\u2013transitivity and the notion of \u2217\u2013transitive closure depend on the t\u2013norm \u2217.\nThe following lemma is well-known.\nLemma 3.6 If R is a fuzzy relation on X then for all x, y \u2208 X:\nT (R)(x, y) = R(x, y) \u2228\n\u221e \u2228\nn=1\n\u2228\nt1,...,tn\u2208X\nR(x, t1) \u2217 . . . \u2217R(tn, y)."}, {"heading": "4 Compatible extensions revisited", "text": "Compatible extensions of fuzzy relations have been introduced in [13] in the context offered by the Go\u0308del t-norm. In this section we will propose a more appropriate concept of compatible extension. The notion of compatible extension will be given in the context of fuzzy sets theory associated with a left\u2013continuous t\u2013norm \u2217 and will use the residuum instead of negation. For the case of the Go\u0308del t-norm one obtains a stronger notion than in [13]. Two extension theorems which generalize Duggan\u2019s result (Theorem 2.4) are proved. The first of them is formulated for a left\u2013continuous arbitrary t\u2013norm and the second one for the Go\u0308del t-norm. Their proof will use a series of preliminary lemmas and propositions on the \u2217\u2013compatible extensions which have an intrinsic interest too.\nLet (B,\u2228,\u2227,\u00ac, 0, 1) be a Boolean algebra. The Boolean implication \u2192 in B is defined by a \u2192 b = \u00aca\u2228b. An easy computation shows that \u00ac(a\u2227\u00acb) = a \u2192 b for all a, b \u2208 B. We observe that this equality does not hold in the residuated lattice ([0, 1],\u2228,\u2227,\u2192, 0, 1).\nLet X be a non\u2013empty set. By identifying the (crisp) relations with their characteristic functions, any relation R onX can be written R : X2 \u2192 L2, where L2 is the Boolean algebra {0, 1}. Then the asymmetric part PR : X\n2 \u2192 L2 is given by PR(x, y) = R(x, y) \u2227 \u00acR(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 X .\nLemma 4.1 If R : X2 \u2192 L2 is a crisp relation on X then \u00acPR(x, y) = R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 X.\nLemma 4.2 Let R,Q be two crisp relations on X. (i) Q is a compatible extension of R iff R \u2286 Q and Q(y, x) \u2264 R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 X; (ii) R is consistent iff T (R)(y, x) \u2264 R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 X.\nProof. Assume R \u2286 Q. By Lemma 4.1 we have for all x, y \u2208 X : PR(x, y) \u2264 PQ(x, y) \u21d4 PR(x, y) \u2264 Q(x, y) \u2227 \u00acQ(y, x) \u21d4 PR(x, y) \u2264 \u00acQ(y, x) \u21d4 Q(y, x) \u2264 \u00acPR(x, y) = R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x) From these equivalences (i) follows immediately and (ii) is a particular case of (i).\nIf \u2217 is a left\u2013continuous t\u2013norm snd R is a fuzzy relation on X , then the\nasymmetric part of R is a fuzzy relation PR onX defined by PR(x, y) = R(x, y)\u2217 \u00acR(y, x) for any x, y \u2208 X .\nLet \u2227 be the Go\u0308del t-norm. In this case the asymmetric part PR : X 2 \u2192 [0, 1] has the form PR(x, y) = R(x, y) \u2227 \u00acR(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 X . Following [13], a fuzzy relation Q on X is a compatible extension of R if R \u2286 Q and PR \u2286 PQ; R is consistent if T (R) is a compatible extension of R.\nLemma 4.3 Assume that \u2217 is the Go\u0308del t-norm. Let R,Q be two fuzzy relations on X.\n(i) Q is a compatible extension of R if R \u2286 Q and Q(y, x) \u2264 \u00acPR(x, y) for all x, y \u2208 X;\n(ii) R is consistent iff T (R)(y, x) \u2264 \u00acPR(x, y) for all x, y \u2208 X.\nProof. (i) If R \u2286 Q the following assertions are equivalent: (1) PR \u2286 PQ; (2) PR(x, y) \u2264 Q(x, y) \u2227 \u00acQ(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 X ; (3) PR(x, y) \u2264 \u00acQ(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 X ; (4) PR(x, y) \u2227Q(y, x) = 0 for all x, y \u2208 X ; (5) Q(y, x) \u2264 \u00acPR(x, y) for all x, y \u2208 X . According to these equivalences (i) follows easily; (ii) is a particular case of (i).\nIn the definitions of the notions of compatible extension and consistent consistent fuzzy relation the negation appears. According to Remark 3.4, in the case of the Go\u0308del t-norm these notions do not describe adequately situations of fuzzy uncertainty. It is necessary to find some notion to elude negation, using possibly only the notion of implication. By Lemma 4.1, for the crisp relations, the asymmetric part is expressed with respect to the Boolean implication, thus the definitions existing in the crisp case satisfy this desideratum.\nRemark 4.4 According to Lemma 4.3 (ii), the notion of consistency of a fuzzy relation from [13] coincides with the notion of consistency defined in [6].\nSince for the Go\u0308del t-norm Lemma 4.1 is not valid, we cannot express this definition of the compatible extension and the consistency only in terms of the residuum.\nFollowing the suggestion given by Lemma 4.2 we shall propose a different alternative definition, in which the residuum appears.\nDefinition 4.5 Let \u2217 be a left\u2013continuous t\u2013norm and the fuzzy relations R,Q on X. Q is called a \u2217-compatible extension of R if R \u2286 Q and Q(y, x) \u2264 R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x) for any x, y \u2208 X. Relation R is \u2217\u2013consistent if its \u2217\u2013transitive closure T (R) of R is a \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R, i.e. T (R)(y, x) \u2264 R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 X.\nRemark 4.6 We assume that \u2217 is the Go\u0308del t-norm \u2227. Let Q be a \u2227\u2013compatible extension of R. For any x, y \u2208 X we have Q(y, x)\u2227PR(x, y) = Q(y, x)\u2227R(x, y)\u2227\n\u00acQ(y, x) = 0 therefore Q(y, x) \u2264 \u00acPR(x, y). According to Lemma 4.3, Q is a compatible extension of R.\nExample 4.7 Assume that \u2217 is the Go\u0308del t-norm \u2227, X = {x, y} and R,Q the fuzzy relations on X defined by\nR(x, x) = R(y, y) = 1; R(x, y) = 12 ; R(y, x) = 1 3 ; Q(x, x) = Q(y, y) = 1; Q(x, y) = Q(y, x) = 23 . It is easy to see that Q is a compatible extension of R but R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x) = 12 \u2192 1 3 = 1 3 \u2264 2 3 = Q(y, x). Then Q is not a \u2227\u2013compatible extension of R. In conclusion the \u2227\u2013compatibility implies the compatibility but the converse\nis not true.\nRemark 4.8 Assume that \u2217 is the Lukasiewicz t\u2013norm \u2217L. Then, for any x, y \u2208 X, we have the equivalences:\nQ(x, y) \u2264 R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x) iff Q(y, x) \u2264 1\u2212R(x, y) +R(y, x) thus Q is a \u2217L\u2013compatible extension of R iff R(x, y) \u2264 Q(x, y) and R(x, y) +R(y, x) \u2264 1\u2212Q(y, x) for any x, y \u2208 X.\nProposition 4.9 If \u2217 is a left\u2013continuous t\u2013norm and R a fuzzy relation on X, then the following assertions are equivalent:\n(i)R is \u2217\u2013consistent; (ii) For any integer n \u2265 1 and for any x, y, t1, . . . , tn \u2208 X we have R(y, t1) \u2217R(t1, t2) \u2217 . . . \u2217R(tn, x) \u2264 R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x).\nProof.

Let {Ri}i\u2208I be a chain of \u2217\u2013consistent fuzzy relations on X and R = \u22c3\ni\u2208I\nRi. We shall prove that R is \u2217\u2013consistent.\nLet x, y \u2208 X . By Proposition 4.9 we must prove that for any integer n \u2265 1 and t1, . . . , tn \u2208 X the following inequality holds:\n(a) R(y, t1) \u2217 . . . \u2217R(tn, x) \u2264 R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x). By the definition of R and Lemma 3.2 (3): (b) R(y, t1) \u2217 . . .

Since {Ri}i\u2208I is a chain there exists j \u2208 {i1, . . . , in} such that Ri1 , . . . , Rin \u2286 Rj hence\nRi1(y, t1) \u2217 . . . \u2217Rin(tn, x) \u2264 Rj(y, t1) \u2217 . . . \u2217Rj(tn, x). Let k \u2208 I and u \u2208 {j, k} such that Rj \u2286 Ru, Rk \u2286 Ru.

The class E(R) of all \u2217\u2013 compatible extensions of R is closed upward.\nProof. Let (Qi)i\u2208I be a chain of \u2217\u2013compatible extensions of R. Let us denote Q = \u22c3\ni\u2208I\nQi, hence R \u2286 Q. For any x, y \u2208 X we have\nQ(y, x) \u2217R(x, y) = [ \u2228\ni\u2208I\nQi(y, x)] \u2217R(x, y) = \u2228\ni\u2208I\nQi(y, x) \u2217R(x, y) \u2264 R(y, x)\nbecause any Qi is a \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R. By Lemma 3.1 (1) we get Q(y, x) \u2264 R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x). Then Q is a \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R.\nLemma 4.15 The intersection of two closed upward classes of fuzzy relations is closed upward.\nIf R be a fuzzy relation on X and x, y \u2208 X then we define the extension R[x, y] of R by\nR[x, y](a, b) =\n{\nR(a, b) if (a, b) 6= (x, y) 1 if (a, b) = (x, y)\nA class R of fuzzy relations on X is arc\u2013receptive if T (R[x, y]) \u2208 R for any \u2217\u2013transitive relation R \u2208 R and for all x 6= y such that R(x, y) = 0.\nLemma 4.16 The intersection of two arc\u2013receptive classes is arc\u2013receptive.\nProposition 4.17 If R is a \u2217\u2013transitive fuzzy relation on X, x 6= y and R(y, x) = 0, then T (R[x, y]) is a compatible extension of R.\nProof. Let a, b \u2208 X . To prove that T (R[x, y])(b, a) \u2264 R(a, b) \u2192 R(b, a) is equivalent to verifying the following two conditions:\n(a) R[x, y](b, a) \u2264 R(a, b) \u2192 R(b, a); (b) For any integer n \u2265 1 and t1, . . . , tn \u2208 X , R[x, y](b, t1) \u2217 . . . \u2217R[x, y](tn, a) \u2264 R(a, b) \u2192 R(b, a). If (b, a) 6= (x, y) then R[x, y](b, a) = R(b, a) \u2264 R(a, b) \u2192 R(b, a), according to Lemma 3.1 (4). If (b, a) = (x, y) then R(a, b) = R(y, x) = 0 and R(a, b) \u2192 R(b, a) = 0 \u2192 R(b, a) = 1, hence (a) is also verified.\nNow we shall prove (b). Let n \u2265 1 and t1, . . . , tn \u2208 X . Assume (x, y) is distinct from all (b, t1), . . . , (tn, a). Then\nR[x, y](b, t1) \u2217 . . . \u2217R[x, y](tn, a) = R(b, t1) \u2217 . . . \u2217R(tn, a) \u2264 \u2264 R(b, a) \u2264 R(a, b) \u2192 R(b, a) because R is \u2217\u2013transitive. We consider now the case when among the pairs (b, t1), . . . , (tn, a) there exists one equal to (x, y). Denote t0 = b, tn+1 = a. Let tk be the first occurrence of x in the sequence t0, . . . , tn+1 and t1 be the last occurrence of y in this sequence. Then (ti, ti+1) 6= (x, y) for i = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1 and i = 1, . . . , n. This yields\nR[x, y](b, tn) \u2217 . . . \u2217R[x, y](tn, a) \u2217R(a, b) \u2264 R(b, t1) \u2217 . . . \u2217R(tk\u22121, x) \u2217R(y, tl+1) \u2217 . . . \u2217R(tn, a) \u2217R(a, b) = = R(y, tl+1) \u2217 . . . \u2217 R(tn, a) \u2217 R(a, b) \u2217 R(b, t1) \u2217 . . . \u2217 R(tk\u22121, x) \u2264 R(y, x) =\n0 \u2264 R(b, a). By Lemma 3.1 (1) we obtain R[x, y](b, t1) \u2217 . . . \u2217R[x, y](tn, a) \u2264 R(a, b) \u2192 R(b, a)\nThen (b) was proved.\nTheorem 4.18 Let R be a class of fuzzy relations on X satisfying the following conditions:\n(i) R is closed upward and arc\u2013receptive; (ii) If R,Q, S \u2208 R, Q is a \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R and S is a \u2217\u2013 compatible extension of Q then S is a \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R. Then for any \u2217\u2013transitive fuzzy relation R \u2208 R there exists a total and \u2217\u2013 transitive fuzzy relation R\u2217 \u2208 R such that R\u2217 is a \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R.\nProof. Let C be the class of \u2217\u2013transitive and \u2217\u2013compatible extensions of R in R. C is non\u2013empty because R \u2208 C. If T is the class of \u2217\u2013transitive fuzzy relations on X then C = R\u2229 E(R) \u2229 T (recall that E(R) is the class of all \u2217\u2013compatible extensions of R). According to Lemmas 4.13 and 4.14, T and E(R) are closed upward, hence, by Lemma 4.15, C is closed upward. By Zorn\u2019s Axiom one gets a maximal member R\u2217 of C, i.e. R\u2217 is a maximal \u2217\u2013transitive and \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R in R.\nIt remains to prove that R\u2217 is total, i.e. for all distinct x, y \u2208 X , R\u2217(x, y) > 0 or R\u2217(y, x) > 0. By absurdum, assume R\u2217(x, y) = R\u2217(y, x) = 0 for some distinct x, y \u2208 X . Since R is arc\u2013receptive, x 6= y and R\u2217(y, x) = 0 implies T (R\u2217[x, y]) \u2208 R.\nR\u2217 fulfills the hypotheses of Proposition 4.17 (R\u2217 is \u2217\u2013transitive, x 6= y and R\u2217(y, x) = 0) therefore T (R\u2217[x, y]) is a \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R\u2217. Since R\u2217 is a \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R and T (R\u2217[x, y]) is a \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R\u2217 it follows that T (R\u2217[x, y]) is a \u2217\u2013compatible extension of R (by (ii)). Thus T (R\u2217[x, y]) \u2208 C. We remark that 1 = R\u2217[x, y](x, y) \u2264 T (R\u2217[x, y]) hence T (R\u2217[x, y])(x, y) = 1. But R\u2217(x, y) = 0 therefore R\u2217 is strictly included in T (R\u2217[x, y]) contradicting the maximality of R\u2217. Thus R\u2217 is total and the proof is finished.\nRemark 4.19 The condition that R is closed upward ensures the existence of maximal members R\u2217 of C (by applying Zorn\u2019s Lemma), and arc-receptivity makes R be closed to the operation T (R\u2217[x, y]), which leads to the fact that R\u2217 is total.\nTheorem 4.20 Assume \u2217 is the Go\u0308del t-norm \u2227 and the class R is closed upward and arc\u2013receptive. Then any \u2227\u2013transitive fuzzy relation R \u2208 R has a \u2227\u2013compatible extension R\u2217, total and \u2227\u2013transitive.\nProof. By Lemma 4.12, for the case of the Go\u0308del t-norm condition (ii) holds.\nRemark 4.21 Let us consider the case of the Go\u0308del t-norm \u2227. Since any \u2227\u2013 compatible extension is also compatible (Remark 5.4), from Theorem 4.20 we get the main result in [13](Theorem 4.7).\nRemark 4.22 Theorems 4.18 and 4.20 are general mathematical results which ensure the existence of the \u2217\u2013compatible extension, \u2217\u2013transitivity and totality of \u2217\u2013transitive fuzzy relations. They generalize the main part of Duggan\u2019s results [10], but also offer fuzzy versions of important extension theorems from the crisp case (see the next section)."}, {"heading": "5 Particular cases", "text": "This section deals with some particular cases of Theorem 4.20. This way we will obtain some fuzzy versions of classical extension theorems (Szpilrajn, Hansson, Suzumura).\nIn this section we will work with the Go\u0308del t-norm \u2227. First we shall remind the definition of some classes of fuzzy relations. A\nfuzzy relation R on X is said to be: \u2022 fuzzy preorder if R is reflexive and \u2227\u2013transitive; \u2022 fuzzy weak order if R is a total fuzzy preorder; \u2022 fuzzy strict partial order if R is irreflexive and \u2227\u2013transitive. We shall denote \u2022 R1= the class of fuzzy strict partial orders on X ; \u2022 R2= the class of fuzzy preorders on X ; \u2022 R3= the class of \u2227\u2013transitive fuzzy relations on X .\nLemma 5.1 [13] The classes R1, R2, R3 are closed upward and arc\u2013receptive.\nThis lemma shows that Theorem 4.20 can be applied for classes R1, R2, R3.\nTheorem 5.2 Any fuzzy strict partial order R on X has a \u2227\u2013compatible extension R\u2217 which is a total fuzzy strict partial order on X.\nRemark 5.3 Theorem 5.2 is a fuzzy generalization of Szpilrajn theorem. The property of \u2227\u2013compatibility which is verified by the extension R\u2217 of R makes this theorem be distinct from other fuzzy versions of Szpilrajn theorem (see [2], [15], [27]).\nThe following result generalizes Hansson\u2019s theorem.\nTheorem 5.4 Any fuzzy preorder R on X has a \u2227\u2013compatible extension R\u2217 which is also a fuzzy weak order.\nTheorem 5.5 For a fuzzy relation R on X the following are equivalent: (i) R has a total and \u2227-transitive \u2227\u2013compatible extension Q; (ii) R has a \u2227\u2013transitive \u2227\u2013compatible extension Q; (iii) R is \u2227\u2013consistent.\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii) Obvious. (ii) \u21d2 (iii) Assume that R has a \u2227\u2013transitive \u2227\u2013compatible extension Q. Let x, y \u2208 X . Since Q is \u2227\u2013transitive, we have T (R) \u2286 Q. Thus, because Q is a \u2227\u2013compatible extension of R, the following inequalities hold:\nT (R)(y, x) \u2264 Q(y, x) \u2264 R(x, y) \u2192 R(y, x). It follows that R is \u2227\u2013consistent.\nThe above result is a fuzzy version of Suzumura\u2019s theorem.\nRemark 5.6 By Remark 4.6, the \u2227\u2013compatibility of fuzzy relations implies the compatibility defined in [13]. Then, from Theorems 5.2, 5.4 and 5.5 obtained above, we obtain Theorems 5.8, 5.2 and 5.4 of [13]. We can also prove the corresponding result of Theorem 5.6, [13]."}, {"heading": "6 Consistent closures of a fuzzy relation", "text": "The consistent closure of a crisp relation was introduced in [3] in order to characterize the consistent rationalizability of crisp choice functions. In this section with any fuzzy relation R we shall assign two fuzzy relations R\u2206, R\u2207 which generalize the consistent closure. For the case of the Go\u0308del t-norm we have R\u2206 = R\u2207 and this construction is the smallest \u2227\u2013consistent fuzzy relation including R.\nLet R be a crisp relation on X . Following [3], the consistent closure of R is defined by\n(6.1) R\u2217 = R \u222a {(x, y)|(x, y) \u2208 T (R) and (y, x) \u2208 R}. R\u2217 can also be written (6.2) R\u2217 = T (R) \u2229 {(x, y)|(x, y) \u2208 R or (y, x) \u2208 R}.\nRemark 6.1 The consistent closure R\u2206 has been introduced in [6], Definition 2.2 and further studied in [7], [8].\nWe want to define a similar notion for fuzzy relations. Let \u2217 be a left\u2013continuous t\u2013norm. In order to define the consistent closure of a fuzzy relation R on X we start from (6.1) and (6.2). Each of these expressions suggest another form of the consistent closure of R.\nIf R is a fuzzy relation on X then we define the fuzzy relations R\u2206 and R\u2207 on X by (6.3) R\u2206(x, y) = R(x, y) \u2228 [T (R)(x, y) \u2217R(y, x)] (6.4) R\u2207(x, y) = T (R)(x, y) \u2217 [R(x, y) \u2228R(y, x)] for any x, y \u2208 X . It is obvious that (6.3) (resp. (6.4)) generalizes (6.1) (resp. (6.2)).\nLemma 6.2 Let R be a fuzzy relation on X. Then (i) R\u2207 \u2286 R\u2206; (ii) If \u2217 is the Go\u0308del t-norm \u2227 then R\u2207 = R\u2206.\nProof. (i) By Lemma 3.2 (1) R\u2207(x, y) = (T (R)(x, y) \u2217R(x, y)) \u2228 (T (R)(x, y) \u2217R(y, x)) \u2264 R(x, y) \u2228 T (R)(x, y) \u2217R(y, x)) = R\u2206(x, y). (ii) In case of \u2227 we have: R\u2207(x, y) = (T (R)(x, y) \u2227R(x, y)) \u2228 (T (R)(x, y) \u2227R(y, x)) = R(x, y) \u2228 (T (R)(x, y) \u2227R(y, x)) because R(x, y) \u2264 T (R)(x, y).\nRemark 6.3 Consider the set X = {x, y} and the fuzzy relation R on X given\nby the matrix R =\n(\n1 13 1 2 1\n)\n.\nAssume that \u2217 is the product t\u2013norm. We observe that R is \u2217\u2013transitive then\nR = T (R).

By Remark 4.10, R\u2207 is \u2217\u2013consistent. (iii) Assume Q is \u2217\u2013consistent and R \u2286 Q. For any x, y \u2208 X we have T (R)(y, x) \u2217R(x, y) \u2264 T (Q)(y, x) \u2217Q(x, y) \u2264 Q(y, x) T (R)(y, x) \u2217R(y, x) \u2264 R(y, x) \u2264 Q(y, x) hence R\u2207(y, x) = T (R)(y, x) \u2217R(y, x) \u2228 T (R)(y, x) \u2217R(x, y) \u2264 Q(y, x). Thus R\u2207 \u2286 Q.\nCorollary 6.5 Let \u2217 be the Go\u0308del t-norm \u2227. If R is a fuzzy relation on X then R\u2206 = R\u2207 is the smallest \u2227\u2013consistent fuzzy relation on X containing R.\nAccording to Corollary 6.5, the fuzzy relation R\u2217 = R\u2206 = R\u2207 is said to be the \u2227\u2013consistent closure of R. If R\u22121 is the converse relation of R (R\u22121(x, y) = R(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 X) then R\u2217 = T (R) \u2229 (R \u222aR\u22121).\nExample 6.6 Consider the set X = {x, y, z} and the fuzzy relation R given by\nthe matrix R =\n\n 1 13 1 1 4 1 1 2\n1 2 1 1\n\n.\nBy computation we obtain T (R) =\n\n 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2\n1 2 1 1\n\n\ntherefore\nR\u2217 = T (R) \u2229 [R \u222aR\u22121] =\n\n 1 13 1 1 3 1 1 2\n1 2 1 1\n\n."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "This paper contains the following contributions: (a) A new notion of compatible extension of a fuzzy relation is defined and on its basis a new type of consistency of fuzzy relations is introduced. These two notions are different from those of [13], against which they have the advantage of being defined using only the residuum \u2192 associated with a left\u2013continuous t\u2013norm \u2217 2\n(b) These new notions allow to obtain a general extension theorem which generalizes a significant part 3 of Duggan\u2019s extension theorem from the case of crisp relations. From this general result are obtained as particular cases fuzzy versions of some important extension theorems for crisp relations (Szpilrajn, Hansson and Suzumura).\n(c) The notion of consistent closure of a crisp relation [3] is generalized to fuzzy relations by two constructions R\u2206 and R\u2207, intrinsicly related to the type of consistency from this paper.\nWe present next a few open problems which come from the results of this paper.\n(1) To prove a fuzzy version of Duggan\u2019s General Extension Theorem (see Theorem 2.5) allowing to obtain fuzzy forms of Dushnik\u2013Miller and Donaldson\u2013 Weymark theorems.\n(2) To obtain a result generalizing Theorems 4.16 and 4.17, as well as their consequences, in the context offered by fuzzy relations indicators (see [14], pp. 66-71, [25]).\n2We talk about Theorem 2.4, that part of Duggan\u2019s result which generalizes the theorems of Szpilrajn, Hansson and Suzumura.\n3Avoiding the negation in formulating these definitions is necessary to elude those cases when this operator takes only the extreme values 0 and 1 (for example, in case of the Go\u0308del t-norm)\n(3) The consistency of crisp relations has been intensively used in social choice theory (see [22] or [5]). It would be interesting to study whether the notion of fuzzy consistency and the results of this paper can be connected to fuzzy social choice theory [19]."}], "references": [{"title": "Fuzzy choice functions", "author": ["A.
