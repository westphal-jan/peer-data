Therefore, research on Vietnamese language processing is an essential task. This paper focuses on three main tasks for Vietnamese language processing including POS tagging, chunking, and NER. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art system namely NNVLP for the Vietnamese language processing. NNVLP toolkit outperforms previously published toolkits on three tasks including POS tagging, chunking, and NER.

In particular, most of the toolkits for POS tagging task attempted to use conventional models such as CRF (Mai-Vu Tran, 2013) and MEMM (Le-Hong et al., 2010). (Mai-Vu Tran, 2013) also used CRF for chunking task. Recently, at the VLSP 2016 workshop for NER task, several participated system use MEMM (Le-Hong, 2016), (Nguyen et al., 2016) and CRF (Le et al., 2016) to solve this problem."}, {"heading": "3 NNVLP API and Web Demo", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 System Architecture", "text": "We implement the deep neural network model described in (Pham and Le-Hong, 2017).

In particular, this model takes as input a sequence of the concatenation of word embedding pre-trained by word2vec2 tool and character-level word feature trained by CNN. That sequence is then passed to a Bi-LSTM, and then a CRF layer takes as input the output of the BiLSTM to predict the best named entity output sequence. Figure 1 and Figure 2 describe the architectures of BI-LSTM-CRF layers, and CNN layer respectively. NNVLP toolkit uses these architectures for all tasks including POS tagging, chunking, and NER. Because each word in the Vietnamese language\n2https://code.google.com/archive/p/ word2vec/\nmay consist of more than one syllables with spaces in between, which could be regarded as multiple words by the unsupervised models, we, first, segment the input texts into sequences of words by pyvi toolkit3. These word sequences are put into NNVLP toolkit to get corresponding POS tag sequences. Next, these word and POS tag sequences are put into NNVLP toolkit to get corresponding chunk sequences. Finally, NNVLP toolkit takes as input sequences of the concatenation of word, POS tag, and chunk to predict corresponding NER sequences.

In particular, we conduct experiments on Viet Treebank corpus for POS tagging and chunking tasks, and on VLSP shared task 2016 corpus for NER task. All of these corpora are converted to CoNLL format. The corpus of POS tagging task consists of two columns namely word, and POS tag. For chunking task, there are three columns namely word, POS tag, and chunk in the corpus. The corpus of NER task consists of four columns. The order of these columns are word, POS tag, chunk, and named entity. While NER corpus has been separated into training and testing parts, the POS tagging and chunking data sets are not previously divided . For this reason, we use 80% of these data sets as a training set, and the remaining as a testing set. Because our system adopts early stopping method, we use 10% of these data sets from the training set as a development set when training NNVLP system.
