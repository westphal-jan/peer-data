In particular, much work has focused on predicting the relative frequencies across languages of orders of the elements {demonstrative, adjective, numeral, noun}. Table 1 shows the relative frequencies of different orders for these elements across languages (assuming each language exhibits only one dominant order) according to data given in Dryer (in prep). In this table, D stands for demonstrative, N stands for numeral, A stands for adjective, and n stands for noun. Genera counts are the counts of linguistic genera showing a certain order; adjusted frequencies are calculated using a methodology described in Dryer (in prep) intended to minimize any overrepresentation of some orders that may arise from areal effects.\nHere we consider three proposals from the literature on how to explain these frequencies.

To do so, we use Poisson regression, as first used in Cysouw (2010). In Poisson regression we represent each language with a set of m binary-valued features, and say that the expected frequency \u03bb of a language in a sample of k languages is given by:\n\u03bb = eV\nV = wb + w1 \u00b7 f1 + w2 \u00b7 f2 + ...+ wm \u00b7 fm, (1)\nwhere fi is an indicator variable with value 0 when the ith feature is \u2212, and 1 when the ith feature is +, and where the weights wb and w1, ..., wm are those that maximize the probability of the observed counts of languages.

Feature weights may be negative, in which case they can be considered marked. In that case, the model embodies the claim that the presence of these features is disfavored in languages. Since features get different weights, the model implements different degrees of markedness per feature, as in Harmonic Grammar (Smolensky and Legendre, 2006). The model finds the degrees of markedness which best predict the data given the feature system."}, {"heading": "2.2 Feature systems under comparison", "text": "Within this framework, we compare three feature systems: (1) the system in Dryer (in prep), (2) the system in Cysouw (2010), and (3) the theory of Cinque (2005).

In this model, orders are built up by a generative process that makes decisions in a certain order; whereas in featural models, orders are assigned scores based on features that have no intrinsic order. For example, the centerpiece of the theory of Cinque (2005) is the claim that the Merge order of D>N>A>n is universal, and that the Linear Correspondence Axiom (LCA) of Kayne (1994) holds, such that every word order must be generated from a base structure of the form seen in Figure 1, plus movement operations. Orders that are not derivable from this base structure are not generated at all in Cinque\u2019s theory. For such orders, the question of what if any movement operations apply never even arises under Cinque\u2019s theory, in principle.\nFor example, suppose we think of the Cinque model in terms of features: then AlternativeMergeOrder is a feature that can be + or \u2212, and some movement operation is reflected in a feature that can be + or \u2212. For an order that violates the specified merge order, we would give it value + for AlternativeMergeOrder and \u2212 for the movement feature, but this is not a completely correct reflection of Cinque\u2019s derivational theory. The reason is that under the generative process, if a word order violates the required merge order, then the model never even decides whether to perform a movement operation or not: thus the value of the movement feature should not be \u2212 or +, but undefined.\nThe theory of Cinque (2005) also involves theoretically-derived graded markedness values for operations in the generative process: for instance, total movement is claimed to be unmarked, \u201cpicture of who\u201d type movement is claimed to be especially marked, and the rest of the movement features are claimed to be marked. In our methodology, we let the model decide on feature weights (markedness values) without regard to these a priori markedness values. As such, it is possible that our implementation of the\nCinque model does not reflect its full intent. The fact that our weights are derived through fits to the data and not through a priori considerations is especially noteworthy in the case of the feature AlternativeMergeOrder in Cinque\u2019s system. In a literal reading of Cinque (2005), orders which violate the required merge order should occur with probability 0, and thus the feature AlternativeMergeOrder should be assigned infinitely negative weight. In that case the model would assign probability 0 to any data that has nonzero frequency for any such order. In our work we let the model learn that AlternativeMergeOrder has a large negative weight, without postulating that orders violating the required merge order must have probability 0.\nHere we represent Cinque\u2019s model using features for the sake of convenience in statistical comparison, while noting that this introduces the issues above. And there is a further issue that should be noted. If Merge orders other than that seen in Figure 1 are allowed, then not only are otherwise impossible word orders generable by postulating that those word orders are generated as a base structure; additionally, word orders that were already generable under Cinque\u2019s theory also wind up with new derivations from different base structures. Taking this multiplicity of possible derivations into account increases the complexity of the problem of inferring feature weights, and takes it outside the scope of standard Poisson regression or other generalized linear models. This is a difficulty shared by the modeling approaches of Cysouw (2010) and Merlo (2015). For expediency, however, we follow previous work in treating every word order not derivable from the D>N>A>n base structure of Figure 1 as being derived by an alternative Merge order (so that AlternativeMergeOrder =T) with no movement, ignoring alternative derivations.\nWe also note that in formalizing Cinque\u2019s (2005) theory into a featural description, we noticed certain unclarities in the text which affected our formalization. These are as follows (note that Cinque uses N where we use n, and Num where we use N):\n\u2022 Cinque describes order AnDN (his (k)) as involving two marked options: \u201cderivation with raising of NP plus pied-piping of the picture of who type of the lowest modifier (A), followed by raising of [A N] without pied-piping around both Num and Dem\u201d (emphasis ours). Technically speaking, it is not clear whether this latter raising (without pied-piping) should count as marked in his system, since the only relevant parameter of movement is \u201cMovement of NP without pied piping\u201d (his (7biii)), but this latter raising is movement of AP, not\nNP. Nevertheless we followed Cinque in assigning this word order a + value for movement (of NP) without pied piping. This decision is also justified by Cinque\u2019s comment (p. 320) that his system is \u201c[k]eeping to the idea that. . . postnominal orders are only a function of the raising of the NP (or of an XP containing the NP). . . \u201d.\nAdditionally, there is an inconsistency in Cinque (2005) between (7bv), where this order is stated to involve partial movement, and (6k), where partial movement is not listed as a type of markedness for this order. Here we went with (7bv) and listed this order as involving partial_move=+; we believe that this treatment is the most globally consistent overall, on analogy with orders such as NnAD which Cinque treats as involving partial movement because there are multiple types of movement and the first (raising of NP around A) is only partial.\n\u2022 As with AnDN, there is inconsistency between (7bv) and the wordorder-specific description of AnND (6w): in the former, this order is stated to involve partial movement of NP, but in the latter, partial movement is not mentioned as a type of markedness. As with AnDN, we listed this order as involving partial_move=+.\nRegarding the first two cases, it should be emphasized that Cinque (2005) is far from totally clear about what does and does not count as partial (and thus marked) movement. For example, NnAD is described as involving partial (and thus marked) raising of NP around A, followed by a second raising that gets the raised constituent all the way to the left edge. But although nNAD likewise starts with a partial raising of NP around A (and N) followed by a second raising that gets the raised constituent all the way to the left edge, it is not considered to involve partial movement.\nAdditionally, there is one case of what we believe is a coding error by Cysouw (2010) in his implementation of Cinque\u2019s model (see his Appendix on page 284):\n\u2022 Cysouw encodes nNAD as involving NP movement with pied piping of the picture of who variety, but Cinque describes this order ((6t)) as involving whose picture pied piping instead, which seems correct to us."}, {"heading": "2.6 Comparison with Merlo (2015)", "text": "Merlo (2015) conducts a study with similar aims to ours and uses featurizations more or less the same as what we\u2019ve discussed above. She uses\nfeatures to predict frequency classes using a Naive Bayes estimator and an Weighted Averaged One-Dependence (WAODE) estimator, rather than Poisson regression as we use here and as was proposed by Cysouw (2010). As a summary of how this works: Merlo (2015) first discretizes the integervalued word order frequency counts (by language or by genus) into 2, 4, or 7 categories; then she learns a model that categorizes language classes by their features according to the classic Naive Bayes formula:\nP (class|features) \u221d P (features|class)P (class) P (features|class) = \u220f\nfi\u2208features P (fi|class),\nwhere fi is the value of the ith feature in the featurization scheme under consideration; our fi here are Merlo\u2019s ai in her Equations 1\u20134, p. 334. A word order is assigned to the frequency class that maximizes the probability P (class|features) above for that word order\u2019s features. Technically these \u201cfeatures\u201d are attribute-value pairs, such as Symmetry1=T for the Dryer model or Partial=whose-pp for the Cinque model. The WAODE model is a bit more complex than the Naive Bayes model but is fundamentally similar.\nThese models are trained under two approaches: type-based, where training data consists of language types and their features and frequencies, and token-based, where the frequent language types are repeated multiple times in the training data and the language types with frequency zero appear with frequency zero. In the token-based approach, the model is not penalized for miscategorizing language types with frequency None, because these do not appear in the training data.\nOur work differs from Merlo\u2019s approach on two points:\n\u2022 In predicting typological data, we use Poisson regression, which is a discriminative log-linear predictor, rather than Naive Bayes and WAODE, which are generative models.\n\u2022 Our models predict integer-valued typological counts, whereas the models in Merlo (2015) predict unordered categorically-valued frequency classes.\nWe favor Poisson regression (and more generally log-linear models) over the Naive Bayes/WAODE approach because it allows us to predict more fine-grained typological data and to model the strong intuition that the effects of features on typological frequencies should be monotonic.\nMerlo\u2019s (2015) models have the property that feature weights are not monotonic in their preferences for frequency classes. For example, in a\nmodel where the goal is to classify each language into the categories (e.g.) {Very Frequent, Frequent, Rare, None}, there is nothing to prevent a feature from getting weights that favor Very Frequent and None while disfavoring Frequent and Rare. Examples of this non-monotonicity in feature weights can be seen in Merlo\u2019s (2015) Table 11, our Table 2: the feature Harmony=Y favors a language to be either Very Frequent or None, while favoring Frequent and Rare less. The monotonicity in weights means that the weights from this framework cannot be considered markedness values, which either penalize an order (make it less frequent) or do not. In addition to making the model weights less interpretable, this non-monotonicity means that the model has the flexibility to take advantage of artifacts of the discretization of word order frequencies into bins."}, {"heading": "2.7 Comparison with Cysouw (2010)", "text": "As stated in Section 2.5, our approach here is very similar to that of Cysouw (2010): we use the same statistical model class and the same theory comparison (Cinque/Cysouw/Dryer). The differences are as follows:\n\u2022 We use the more recent data of Dryer (in prep) rather than the earlier data of Dryer (2006);\n\u2022 We use the feature set of Dryer (in prep) rather than the earlier feature set of Dryer (in prep);\n\u2022 We correct what we believe is a featurization error made by Cysouw in featurizing Cinque\u2019s theory."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "The results do not give clear grounds for deciding between the Dryer model and the Cinque model, but both of these models come out better than the\nCysouw (2010) model. Whether or not the Dryer model comes out better depends on whether we use the model to predict adjusted frequencies or genera counts."}, {"heading": "3.1 Predicting Adjusted Frequencies", "text": "Table 3 shows log likelihoods for models predicting adjusted frequency (rounded to the nearest integer). It also shows the number of parameters (d.f.) in each model. The table shows that Cinque\u2019s model slightly outperforms Dryer (in prep) on fitting the data.\nFor a more detailed comparison of model performance, we compared model predictions to observed adjusted frequencies from Dryer (in prep). Figure 2 shows model predictions compared against adjusted frequency.\nWe wanted to know how much each order contributed to model fit, so in Figure 3 we show signed \u03c72-discrepancies between model predictions and adjusted frequency. The \u03c72 discrepancy measures how much the prediction error for each word order contributes to the overall discrepancy between data and model fit; signed \u03c72 discrepancy presents this discrepancy in the direction of the discrepancy for each order (whether it under-predicts or over-predicts). If a model predicts a count of Ei for the ith word order and the observed count is Oi, then the signed \u03c7 2 discrepancy is:\n(Oi \u2212 Ei)\u00d7 |Oi \u2212 Ei| Ei .\nThe magnitude of the discrepancy corresponds to how much a model is penalized for failing to predict a certain order.\nAs another way to analyze the results, we show in Figures 4 and 5 the weights assigned to features for different word unders under the Dryer model and the Cinque model. Here we see that Cinque\u2019s model works by strongly penalizing low-frequency orders using the AlternativeMergeOrder feature,\nand then the differences among the remaining orders are handled by the rest of the features.\nOne limitation of applying Poisson regression to the adjusted frequency data is that Dryer (in prep)\u2019s method of computing adjusted frequencies in general compresses high frequency counts more than low frequency counts. This means that adjusted frequency may overly penalize models that perform best at predicting the counts of common orders. For this reason, it is also important to evaluate the performance of the models under consideration in predicting genera counts. We turn to this matter in the next section."}, {"heading": "3.2 Predicting Genera Counts", "text": "Now we turn to models that were trained to predict the genera count data given in Dryer (in prep). When we use the various feature systems to predict genera counts, we get the following data log-likelihoods, shown in Table 4:\nSo when predicting genera, we get the best fit to the data using the set of features from Dryer (in prep), followed by Cinque\u2019s (2005) features, followed by Cysouw\u2019s (2010) features.\nWe think Cinque\u2019s model comes out worse when predicting genera primarily because it underpredicts NnAD orders, whereas the Dryer model gets that order exactly correct. This can be seen in Figure 6, which shows model predictions, and Figure 7, which shows signed \u03c72 discrepancies compared to genera counts. Figures 8 and 9 show the optimal feature weights for the Dryer and Cinque models, respectively, when predicting genera counts."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "The results give clear evidence that the Dryer (in prep) and Cinque (2005) model provide feature systems that have better predictive power than the model of Cysouw (2010). But in our opinion they do not give strong reason\nto favor Cinque\u2019s model over Dryer\u2019s model or vice versa. Although under a certain interpretation Cinque\u2019s model can provide a slightly higher fit to the data, this only holds under one featurization, and it does not hold when predicting genera counts. The discrepancy in results between adjusted fre-\nquency and genera counts may be due to the particular distributional characteristics of adjusted frequency as discussed above. The analysis suggests overall that the Dryer model and the Cinque model have roughly similar predictive power, and the current data do not discriminate between them."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by NSF DDRI grant #1551543 to R.F."}], "references": [{"title": "Deriving Greenberg\u2019s Universal 20 and its exceptions", "author": ["G.

Orders that are not derivable from this base structure are not generated at all in Cinque\u2019s theory. For such orders, the question of what if any movement operations apply never even arises under Cinque\u2019s theory, in principle. For example, suppose we think of the Cinque model in terms of features: then AlternativeMergeOrder is a feature that can be + or \u2212, and some movement operation is reflected in a feature that can be + or \u2212. For an order that violates the specified merge order, we would give it value + for AlternativeMergeOrder and \u2212 for the movement feature, but this is not a completely correct reflection of Cinque\u2019s derivational theory. The reason is that under the generative process, if a word order violates the required merge order, then the model never even decides whether to perform a movement operation or not: thus the value of the movement feature should not be \u2212 or +, but undefined. The theory of Cinque (2005) also involves theoretically-derived graded markedness values for operations in the generative process: for instance, total movement is claimed to be unmarked, \u201cpicture of who\u201d type movement is claimed to be especially marked, and the rest of the movement features are claimed to be marked.", "startOffset": 70, "endOffset": 1616}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "Nevertheless we followed Cinque in assigning this word order a + value for movement (of NP) without pied piping.
