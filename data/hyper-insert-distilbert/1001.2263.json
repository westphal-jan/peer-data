INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1) Developing a robust dictation system to transcribe continuous speech signal into a sequence of words is a difficult task, as continuous speech does not have any natural pauses in between words. It is also difficult to make the system robust for speaker variability and the environment conditions. There are many research organizations working on speech with different approach. The conventional method of building a large vocabulary speech recognizer for any language uses a top-down approach to speech recognition (Huang & Acero 1993)[1]. What they mean by top-down is that these recognizers first hypothesize the sentence, then the words that make up the sentence and ultimately the sub-word units that make up the words. This approach requires large speech corpus with sentence or phoneme level transcription of the speech utterances (Thomas Hain et al 2005; Ravishankar 1996) [2]. The transcriptions must also include different speech order so that the recognizer can build models for all the sounds present. It also requires maintaining a dictionary with the phoneme/subword unit transcription of the words and language models to perform large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. The recognizer outputs words that exist in the dictionary. If the system is to be developed for a new language it requires building of a dictionary and extensive language models for the\nnew language. In country like India which includes 22 officials and a number of unofficial languages, building huge text and speech databases is a difficult task. There are other related works which gained good importance is listed below.\nSome methods that require manually annotated speech corpora for speech recognition are listed. A method called bootstrapping is proposed by Rabiner et al (1982)[3] which can increase the transcribed data for training the system, for speech recognition. Ljolje & Riley (1991)[4] have used an automatic approach to segmentation and labeling of speech when only the orthographic transcription of speech is available. Kemp&Waibel (1998)[5] used unsupervised training approach for speech recognition for TV broadcasts. Wessel&Ney (2001)[6] have proposed an approach in which a low-cost recognizer trained with one hour of manually transcribed speech is used to recognize 72 hours of unrestricted acoustic data. Lamel et al (2002)[7] have shown that the acoustic models can be initialized using as little as 10 minutes of manually annotated data.\nThere are also few methods that do not require any manually annotated speech corpora for speech recognition. Incremental maximum a posteriori estimation of HMMs is proposed by Gotoh & Hochberg (1995)[8]. This algorithm randomly selects a sub-set of data from the training set, updates the model using maximum a posteriori estimation and this process is iterated until it covers all possible units. Chang et al (2000)[9] proposed a method which extracts articulatoryacoustic phonetic features from each frame of speech signal and then the phone is identified using neural networks. There is an interesting approach proposed by Nagarajan & Murthy (2004)[10] for Indian languages. Their approach focuses on automatically segmenting and transcribing the continuous speech signal into syllable-like units using a group delay based segmentation algorithm without the use of manually segmented and labeled speech corpora. This approach is more appropriate for Indian languages as they are syllable centered.\nThe focus of this paper is to extract the possible syllables from the raw Telugu text corpus. Once the syllable like units is\n171 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nobtained they are analyzed to understand their frequency of coverage in words. The final list of words can be prepared considering the words having high probable syllables or identifying the words which contain the maximum syllables.\nDetails of Telugu corpus and Procedure to convert Telugu text to WX notation is introduced in section 2. Algorithm which uses Syllabification rules to syllabify the text is discussed in section 3. A study of results obtained is summarized in section 4 and conclusion and future scope presented in section 5.\nII. CONVERSION OF TELUGU TEXT TO WX NOTATION. Telugu is one of the major Scheduled languages of India. It has the second largest number of speakers mainly concentrated in South India. It is the official language of Andhra Pradesh and second widely spoken language in Tamilnadu, Karnataka. There are number of Telugu language speakers have migrated to Mauritius, South Africa, and recently to USA, UK, and Australia. Telugu is often referred as \"Italian of the East\".\nThe Primary units of Telugu alphabet are syllables, therefore it should be rightly called a syllabic language. There is good correspondence in the written and spoken form of the south Indian languages. Any analysis done on written form would closely relate to spoken form of the language.\nThe Telugu alphabet can be viewed as consisting of more commonly used inventory, a common core, and an overall pattern comprising all those symbols that are used in all domains. The overall pattern consists of 60 symbols, of which 16 are vowels, 3 vowel modifiers, and 41 consonants.\nSince Indian languages are syllable-timed languages, syllable is considered as the basic unit in this work and analysis is performed to identify the words with syllables with high frequency and words with varying coverage of syllables."}, {"heading": "A. Telugu to English letter translation", "text": "The WX notation of thirteen vowel signs\n\u0c05 ,\u0c06 ,\u0c07,\u0c08 ,\u0c09 ,\u0c0a ,\u0c0b ,\u0c0e ,\u0c0f ,\u0c10 ,\u0c12 ,\u0c13 ,\u0c14 is a,A,i,I,u, U,q,eV,e,E,oV,o,O occur as stand alone characters and In UNICODE Standard 3.0., each of these is assigned a hexadecimal code point 0C00-0C7F. When a vowel occurs immediately after a consonant it is represented as a dependent or secondary sign called, guNiMtaM gurtulu. The Telugu alphabet is a syllabic language in which the primary consonant always has an inherent vowel [a] / /. When a consonant is attached with another vowel other than [a] / / then secondary vowel sign is attached to the consonant after removing the inherent vowel /a/. There are exceptions where the primary vowel may be considered as secondary.\nThere are 41 consonants in the common core inventory. In Unicode Standard 3.0 they begin with 0C15 to 0C39 and 0C1A to 0C2F. The character set for consonants in Telugu is complex and peculiar in their function. These character signs have three or more than three distinct shapes depending on their occurrence\n\u2022 Base consonants or Primaries, when they are used as stand alone characters.\n\u2022 Pure consonant or hanger, when used with a vowel other than the inherent vowel /a/\n\u2022 Ottulu or Secondary consonant, when used as a constituent of a conjunct\nThe basic character set for consonants are called as primaries or stand alone characters as they occur in the alphabet. Each of which has an inherent vowel /a/ which often is explicitly indicated by sign / /. This graphic sign indicating the vowel /a/ is normally deleted and replaced with another explicit mark for a different vowel.\nList of pure consonants carrying explicit secondary vowel /a/ sign and its corresponding WX notation are \u0c15-ka \u0c17-ga \u0c16 -Ka\n\u0c18 -G \u0c19 -fa , \u0c1a -ca \u0c1b -Ca \u0c1c -ja \u0c1d -Ja \u0c1e-Fa , \u0c1f -ta \u0c20 -Ta \u0c21 -da \u0c22 -\nDa \u0c23 -Na , \u0c24 -wa \u0c25 -Wa \u0c26 -xa \u0c27 -Xa \u0c28-na , \u0c2a -pa \u0c2b -Pa \u0c2c -ba \u0c2d -\nBa \u0c2e -ma \u0c2f -ya \u0c30 -ra \u0c32 -la \u0c35-va \u0c36 -Sa \u0c37 -Ra \u0c38 -sa \u0c39 -ha \u0c33 -lYa\n\u0c31 -rY\nThe Telugu text in Unicode format is converted to WX notation. The conversion is done character by character using Unicode value of the character. If the Unicode of the character is between 0C15 and 0C39 (\u0c15 to \u0c39 ), representation\ncorresponding to Pure consonant is retrieved from WX table. If the Unicode of the character is between 0C3E and 0C4C (\u0c3e to \u0c4c), the last letter from Pure consonant is removed and secondary vowel representation is added.

SYLLABIFICATION The scripts of Indian languages have originated from the ancient Brahmi script. The basic speech sounds units and basic written form has one to one correspondence. An important feature of Indian language scripts is their phonetic nature. The characters are the orthographic representation of speech sounds. A character in Indian language scripts is close to syllable and can be typically of the following form: C, V, CV, CCV and CVC, where C is a consonant and V is a vowel. There are about 35 consonants and about 15 vowels in Indian languages. The rules required to map the letters to sounds of Indian languages are almost straight forward. All Indian language scripts have common phonetic base.\nThe majority of the speech recognition systems in existence today use an observation space based on a temporal sequence of frames containing short-term spectral information. While these systems have been successful [10, 12], they rely on the incorrect assumption of statistical conditional independence between frames. These systems ignore the segment-level correlations that exist in the speech signal. The high-energy regions in the Short Term Energy function correspond to the syllable nuclei while the valleys at both ends of the nuclei determine the syllable boundaries.\nThe text segmentation is based on the linguistic rules derived from the language. Any syllable based language can be syllabified using these generic rules. To make the text segments exactly equivalent to the speech units.\nThe syllable can be defined as a vowel nucleus supported by consonants on either side, It can be generalized as a C*VC* unit where C is a consonant and V is a vowel. The linguistic rules to extract the syllables segments from a text are generated from spoken Telugu. These rules can be generalized to any syllable centric language. The text is preprocessed to remove any punctuation. The following algorithm divides the word into syllable like units."}, {"heading": "A.

Based on the articulators involved and manner of articulation the consonants are classified as Bilabial, Dental Alveolar, Retroflex, Velar and Glottal. The distribution of consonants is shown in the following Fig. 3.\nBased on the above analysis it is clear that the vowels play a major role in the utterance of speech units. Or the basic unit of utterance is concentric at the vowel which forms the key component in the syllable. It is hence good to build the speech recognition systems considering the syllable as the basic unit."}, {"heading": "E. Syllable Analysis :", "text": "It is shown that most of the Indian languages are syllable centric. Syllable boundary in speech signal can be approximately identified it is intended to make a study of developing a speech recognition system at Syllable level.\nThe total distinct syllables observed are 12,378 and the frequency of occurrence of the syllables is plotted in the following chart. The number of Syllables with frequency less than 100 is 11057(12,378 \u2013 1321). It is observed that nearly 4903 syllables have frequency one. This is due to loanwords from English like (Apple, coffee, strength etc.) When these words are written in Telugu it normally takes the same pronunciation. Such kind of words creates a different syllable which may not occur in the native language. Fig 4 shows the count of Syllables with the frequencies in Hundreds.\n174 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nThe following Fig 5 shows the count of Syllables that have frequency ranging from 1K to 10K.\nThe following Fig 6 shows the count of Syllables that have frequency ranging from 10K to 100K.\nIt is observed that there are nearly 71 syllables that have frequency more than 10K.\nA study is also made in terms of the words which have varying number of syllables with varying frequencies. Here in the following figures, plots are given for words which have syllables with cut-off frequency specified on X axis, Y-axis indicates number of words having the Syllable Index and above cut-off frequency and Syllable Index 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0..\nWords count, with Syllable Index 50%, 80% and 100% and cut-off frequency varying in the range from 100 to 1000 is shown in Fig.7.\nWords count, with Syllable Index 50%, 80% and 100% and cut-off frequency varying in the range from 1K to 10K is shown in Fig.8.\nWords count, with Syllable Index 50%, 80% and 100% and cut-off frequency varying in the range from 10K to 100K is shown in Fig.9.\nIt is observed from the above figures that as the frequency increases the number of words included decreases. Importance of the word depends on the Syllable Index and on the cut-of frequency. It is directly proportional to Syllable Index and cutof frequency.\nV. CONCLUSION This paper explores the details of phonemes and syllables in the text corpus. As there is one to one correspondence between the written form and spoken form of the language, detailed analysis is performed to understand the coverage of different phonemes and syllables. This analysis is useful in selecting good set of words that would cover all possible syllables in large vocabulary. Optimal selection of words depends on the selection strategy applied. Good strategy can be used to obtain limited words, which are useful during recording the speech to train the system. This ultimately improves the performance of the dictation system.\n175 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nREFERENCE: [1] Huang, Acero 1993 Spoken Language Processing.

To develop Dictation System like Dragon for Indian languages it is most important to adapt the system to a speaker with minimum training. In this paper we focus on the importance of creating speech database at syllable units and identifying minimum text to be considered while training any speech recognition system. There are systems developed for continuous speech recognition in English and in few Indian languages like Hindi and Tamil. This paper gives the statistical details of syllables in Telugu and its use in minimizing the search space during recognition of speech. The minimum words that cover maximum syllables are identified. This words list can be used for preparing a small text which can be used for collecting speech sample while training the dictation system. The results are plotted for frequency of syllables and the number of syllables in each word. This approach is applied on the CIIL Mysore text corpus which is of 3 million words.
