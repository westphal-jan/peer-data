However, how to employ it for practical applications (e.g., object recognition) remains unsolvable.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method, called nearest prime simplicial complex approaches (NSC), to obtain a structure-preserving representation and achieve higher performance in object recognition. Specifically, we generate a nested family of simplicial complexes per class, and estimate a prime simplicial complex per class by weighting the lifecycles of alive topological structures. Then we classify objects based on the nearest projection distances from each object to simplices in these simplicial complexes. Furthermore, we also utilize a projection constraint term to enhance the extrapolation ability of NSC and prevent incorrect projection. The main contribution is that we extend the geometrical framework of simplicial complex to object recognition. Specifically, we propose NSC approaches to object recognition and show how to use them for point classification. Experiments in several simulated and practical datasets show that without losing the structure representation, the proposed NSC approaches attain promising performance compared with several well-known algorithms.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will introduce some preliminary of simplicial complex and give a brief survey on persistent homology. In Section 3 we will detail our proposed NSC algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the proposed NSC approaches in Section 4. We conclude the paper in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminary and Related work", "text": "In this section, we will introduce some preliminary of simplicial complex and the construction of simplicial complex, and survey the development of persistent homology."}, {"heading": "2.1 Preliminary", "text": "The simplicial complex is a collection of simplices subject to some rules. The simplex and simplicial complex are defined as follows:\nDefinition 1: Let {v0, v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vp} be a geometrically independent set in RN . We define the p-simplex \u03c3 spanned by v0, v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vp to be the set of all points x of RN such that [6]: x = \u2211p i=0 \u03bbivi, where \u2211p i=0 \u03bbi = 1 and \u2200i, \u03bbi > 0.\nIn general, each p-simplex \u03c3 has p+ 1 faces which are (p\u2212 1)-simplices. The face is obtained by deleting one of the vertices v0, v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vp.\nDefinition 2: A simplicial complex K in RN is a collection of simplices in RN such that [6]: 1) Every face of a simplex of K is in K. 2) The intersection of any two simplices of K is a face of each of them.\nAn illustration on the distinction between simplicial complex and non-simplicial complex is shown in Fig. 1. Obviously, the non-simplicial complex violates the second rule.\nIn this paper, we mainly utilize Lazywitness complexes, which behaves like Delaunay triangulations computed in the intrinsic geometry of the data set X, to construct the simplicial complex for PCD.\nSpecifically, we select a subset Z = {v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vp} \u2282X as the vertex set by using sampling techniques such as max-min sampling or random sampling methods at first. The max-min sampling method randomly extracts one point as the first vertex, and iteratively selects the next n\u2212 1 points that maximize the minimal distances between them and the previous vertices. With this way, the method generates a vertex set uniformly distributed around the data structure [4]. Then we utilize the remaining points as the witness points set {w1, w2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , wq} to determine which simplices occur in the complex [4].\nMore formally, let D be a p \u00d7 q distance matrix, where q denotes the number of the remaining points. Each element D(i, j) measures the distance between landmark point i and witness point j. To discover a persistent topological invariant from PCD, we construct a nested family of simiplicial complexes W (D;R, f). Here R is the radius of metric ball, and f is a non-negative integer. If f=0, we define mj = 0, \u2200j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , q. Otherwise, let mj be the f -th smallest entry of the j-th column of matrix D. Then we utilize two rules to determine which simplices can be added into the complex [4]: 1) a 1-simplex \u03c3 = [vavb] will be added to W (D;R, f) iff there exists a witness wj (1 6 j 6 q) satisfying max(D(a, j),D(b, j)) \u2264 R + mj . 2) a k-simplex [va0va1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vak ] will be added to W (D;R, f) iff there exists a witness wj (1 6 j 6 q) satisfying max(D(a0, j),D(a1, j), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,D(ak, j)) \u2264 R+mj .\nNote that when the number of training samples is small, which is very common in object recognition domain, we can instead use the Rips complex method to obtain the nested families of simplicial complexes. Assuming that each point is a center of a closed Euclidean ball with radius R, Rips method iteratively builds a complex by forming a line in any two points if the balls of them are intersected [4]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Related work", "text": "Persistent homology is to discover some stable topological invariants from PCD. To achieve the goal, there are three crucial steps [5]: 1) selecting a subset that expresses the non-trivial topological attributes measured by homology groups, 2) measuring the importance of these subsets and 3) eliminating those topological attributes with the minimum number of side-effects.\n[4,7] investigated the influence of sampling technique to the estimation of topological invariants. With persistent homology and sampling strategy, [4,7] discovered that image patches with edges lie in a Klein-bottle-shape space. [8] proposed to use geodesic Delaunay triangulation to reduce the number of samples, which is required to capture the topology of PCD.\nTo discover the topological structure from data cloud points, it is necessary to construct the simplicial complexes. There are several different complexes including Ce\u030cch, Rips, Explicit, Witness and Lazywitness complexes in literatures. Let PCD be X, and the radius of PCD be R. Specifically, the Ce\u030cch complex Ce\u030cch(X,R) means the nerve of the collection of metric balls {B(xj), R/2}, xj \u2208 X, j = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , p [9], with vertex set X. [5] proposed \u03b1-complexes, and estimated the invariants through computing the persistent Betti numbers. For saving storage space, Rips(X,R) only stores the edges and vertices, and forms the largest simplicial complex that has the same 1-skeleton (i.e. vertices and edges) as Ce\u030cch(X,R). However, both of the two methods produce a very large amount of complexes, especially for large-scale PCD. To refine the efficiency, [4] proposed witness complex by selecting a group of landmark points and utilizing the remaining points as witness of the existence of simplicial complexes.\n[10] employed Barcode technique to measure the importance of topological attributes. Furthermore, [11] applied the persistent homology to extract some topological features from character-shape point cloud data. [12] studied the smallest coverage issue in sensor networks based on the persistent homology. Assuming that stratified spaces consist of multiple manifolds or non-manifolds, each of which has varying dimension, [13] generalized the computation of persistent homology to that of intersection homology for better analyzing the stratified spaces. Moreover, [14] clustered data points into different stratified space using methods derived from kernel and cokernel persistent homology. [15] investigated the persistent homology of random fields and manifold learning. A major difficulty is that it is not easy to fill the gap between the persistent homology and practical applications."}, {"heading": "3 Nearest Prime Simplicial Complex", "text": "In this section, we will detail the NSC approaches by dividing them into two parts."}, {"heading": "3.1 Selecting prime simplicial complexes", "text": "To utilize the persistent homology for recognition, we propose three crucial steps including eliminating the redundant simplices, recording a recognition-related Barcode and selecting the prime simplicial complexes.\nWith the methods mentioned above, specifically, we can construct a filtered simplicial complex from the point cloud data by increasing R from 0 to \u221e. The filtered complex is an increasing sequence of simplicial complexes which determine an inductive system of homology groups [10]. To our research, we discover\nthat in this sequence, a proper complex, named prime simplicial complex, is useful for recognition. The prime simplicial complex is a relatively stable complex from which we can capture the homology of the data\u2019s topological structure. For better understanding, an example is shown in Fig. 2.\nA k-simplex which is not a face of any k + 1-simplices of the same complex is a relatively highest-dimensional simplex compared with its lower-dimensional ones. Note that we always focus on the relatively highest-dimensional simplices of the prime simplical complex since their faces which are lower-dimensional ones have been implicitly considered in our NSC approaches. For avoiding the repeated computation, we propose to remove these faces when constructing the prime simplicial complex. Here we give a pseudo-code based on Lazywitness complexes in Algorithm 1. Note that in line 3, the matrix E is calculated as:\nE(i, j) = min k\nmax(D(i, k),D\u2217(k, j)))\u2212mk (1)\nand in line 9, the lower-dimensional simplices will be removed after the merging procedure is completed.\nOnce the prime simplicial complex is constructed, we use Barcode technique to record the lifetime of each simplex belonging to the complex as the parameter R increases until Rmax is reached. We only consider the simplices which are still alive when R = Rmax. An example is shown in Fig. 3\n3. Obviously, it is hard to find the best prime simplicial complex from the sequence. Therefore, we propose to select a radius R\u2217 based on the weighted lifecycles:\nR\u2217 = \u2211m i=1 `iMi\u2211m i=1 `i\n(2)\n3 Note that our Barcode is different from that in [15]. The reason is that although [15]\u2019s Barcode technique is a good way to describe the persistent homology by recording the birth and death time of some topological invariants, only the alive simplices are useful for our proposed NSC algorithm.\nAlgorithm 1 Construct the Prime Simplicial Complex using Lazywitness Complexes\ninput Point Data P , R, the ratio r, the family f output the vertices of each simplex constructing the simplicial complex 1: Choose p landmark points and q witness points, where p = size(P )/(r + 1) and q = p \u00b7 r.\n2: Compute the p\u00d7 q matrix D of distances. 3: Compute the p\u00d7p matrix E with off-diagonal entries E(i, j) = R[vivj ] which record\nthe time when edge vivj appears. 4: Consider every two pairs (i, j) where i < j 6 p 5: if E(i, j) 6 R then 6: Add [vivj ] to W (D;R, f). 7: Remove [vi], [vj ] from W (D;R, f) 8: end if 9: Generate higher-dimensional cells inductively: the k-simplex [va0va1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vak ] occurs\niff the three lower-dimensional simplices [va1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vak ], [va0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vak\u22121] and [va0vak ] all occur.\nwhere m is the number of simplices, `i is the length of the i-th barcode, and Mi is the radius corresponding to the median of `i. Intuitively, the shorter the lifecycle, the more unstable the corresponding simplex, and the less influence it raises to the determination of a stable and prime simplicial complex. Formally, let the length of the shorter lifecycles be `A,i (i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s) and the others be `B,j (j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s\u2032) with s+ s\u2032 = m, then we can rewrite Eq. (2) as:\nR\u2217 =\n\u2211s i=1 `A,iMi + \u2211s\u2032 j=1 `B,jMj\u2211s\ni=1 `A,i + \u2211s\u2032 j=1 `B,j\n= \u2211s i=1 `A,iMi\u2211s\ni=1 `A,i + \u2211s\u2032 j=1 `B,j +\n\u2211s\u2032 j=1 `B,jMj\u2211s\ni=1 `A,i + \u2211s\u2032 j=1 `B,j\n(3)\nWhen for all the lifecycles, we have `A,i `B,j , then Eq.

It is also noting that we construct a prime simplicial complex per class for classification."}, {"heading": "3.2 Classifying objects based on NSC", "text": "Assuming that data distribution per class is represented by a prime simplicial complex, we attempt to classify unlabelled samples by projecting the samples\nto the simplices of prime simplicial complexes. With this way, we can avoid projecting them to some holes and voids that may exist in the structures. The holes and voids will lead to incorrect projection and impair the classification performance.\nSpecifically, let \u03c3i (i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m) be a k-simplex with vertices {v0, v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vk}. Then the projection position xp of sample x can be defined as a linear combination of vertices in the simplex:\nxp = k\u2211 i=0 \u03bbivi, where k\u2211 i=0 \u03bbi = 1 (5)\nHere \u03bbi is the weight value. Take a 2-simplex as an example. The weight is equal to\n\u03bbi = { (BTB)\u22121BT (x\u2212 vi), i = 0, 1 1\u2212 \u03bb0 \u2212 \u03bb1, i = 2\n(6)\nwhere B = [v0 \u2212 v1, v1 \u2212 v2]. As for a 1-simplex, the weight is equal to:\n\u03bbi =\n{ (x\u2212v1)T (v1\u2212v0) (v1\u2212v0)T (v1\u2212v0) i = 0\n1\u2212 \u03bb0 i = 1 (7)\nIf the projection index 0 \u2264 \u03bbi \u2264 1, the projection position locates inside the face. Otherwise, it locates outside the face. For \u03bbi > 1 or \u03bbi < 0, on one hand, it can lead to an incorrect projection for distant points. On the other hand, it provides a \u201cforward\u201d and \u201cbackward\u201d interpolation along a face when the number of training sample is small. To make a compromise between preventing that data are incorrectly projected outside the face and preserving the extrapolation ability\nof topological structure, we introduce a parameter \u03b3 to compute the projection position and corresponding projection distance as follows:\nxp = { vi + (1 + \u03b3)(vj \u2212 vi), if \u03bbi > 1 + \u03b3 vi \u2212 \u03b3(vj \u2212 vi), if \u03bbi 6 \u2212\u03b3\n(8)\nwhere vi, vj denote two different vertices of a simplex. Then the distance between a sample x and a simplicial complex of the c-th class is:\ndNSC(x|SCc) = min ` (x\u2212 x`,cp )TA(x\u2212 x`,cp ),\n` = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m; c = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , C (9)\nwhere m denotes the number of simplices in the complex, C is the number of classes, and A is a non-negative matrix 4. Finally, we classify sample to a class that has the nearest simplicial complex distance to the sample:\nC(x) = arg min c dNSC(x|SCc) c = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , C (10)"}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "Experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the NSC approach. Here, two face recognition datasets and eight UCI benchmark data sets [16] are used as listed in Tab. 1.\nWe also use five simulated datasets and four practical multi-view datasets. The five simulated datasets are generated from different topological structures plus random noise with variance \u03c1. They are 1) D1: two concentric circles (\u03c1 = 1.0); 2) D2: two spirals (\u03c1 = 3.5); 3) D3: circle-cross-circle (\u03c1 = 2.0); 4) D4: four circle-cross-circle (\u03c1 = 2.0) and 5) D5: Sphere-cross-sphere (\u03c1 = 1.5) datasets as shown in Fig. 4. Each dataset includes 2-class, each of which has 500 training samples and 500 test samples without overlap. We use max-min sampling strategy to select 50% training samples as the landmark points [4] and the remaining samples as the witness points to construct the prime simplicial complexes. Some examples of these complexes are illustrated in Fig. 4. From the figures we can see that the NSC approaches preserve the structure representation well.\nThe four practical multi-view data sets used for object recognition are COIL20 [17], COIL-100 [18], SOIL-47A and SOIL-47B [19]. The COIL-20 dataset consists of 20 objects, each of which has 72 different views that are sampled every 5o around an axis passing through the object. Each object is an image with size 128\u00d7 128. We subsample them to 32\u00d7 32 ones. The COIL-100 dataset has 4 It can be obtained by metric learning which goes beyond the scope of this paper.\nIn our paper, we set it to be an identity matrix or inverse covariance matrix. The former one is equivalent to a Euclidean distance. Meanwhile, the latter one leads to a classical Mahanalobis distance, named NSC-M.\n100 objects which is collected with the same way as the COIL-20. We subsample each object image to colored 16\u00d7 16 one, short for COIL-100A and gray 32\u00d7 32 one, short for COIL-100B. The SOIL-47A and SOIL-47B datasets are sampled from different illuminations [19]. Each dataset consists of 47 objects, each of which has 21 different views that are sampled every 9o around an axis passing through the object. Each object image is subsampled to a colored image with size 24\u00d7 30. All of these images are directly served as the feature vectors. Some objects in the three practical datasets are shown in Fig. 5.\nAs to the two face datasets, the UMIST face dataset [20] is a multi-view one for testing the robust of our approach, and the ORL dataset [21] is also another popular benchmark one for face recognition. It is worth mentioning that our object recognition is in an instance level, i.e, all the data points in a data set belongs to the same category, and is not in the sense of the VOC (visual object classes) challenges.\nFor comparison, we also compare the performance of our approaches with 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN), 3-NN and SVM with Gaussian RBF kernels (SVMG) [22]. The parameters in SVM are tuned by cross-validation. The whole training set is used by these approaches."}, {"heading": "4.1 Simulated datasets and parameter influences", "text": "We investigate the influence of f in the five datasets. Given f = 0, 1, 2, Rmax = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 0, the average results of 20 repetitions are shown in Tab. 2. From the Tab. 2 we can see that the performance of the proposed approaches with f = 2 is better in most cases. A possible reason is that as [4] pointed out, f = 2 provides a clean persistent interval graph with little \u201cnoise\u201d. Therefore, it leads to a more stable structure representation. Note that in practical noisy environments, such graphs cannot be easily obtained. Meanwhile, f = 1 can be interpreted as arising from a family of coverings of the space X with Voronoi-like regions surrounding each landmark point. We thus set the parameter f to be 1 or 2 in the subsequent experiments. Note that in \u201csmall training samples\u201d case shown in the next subsection, we use Rips complex, which needn\u2019t the parameter f , for object recognition. Furthermore, we found that Mahalanobis distance is helpful to improve the performance of the proposed algorithms in some cases.\nWe also study the influence of the parameter Rmax in determining the optimal value R\u2217, which is closely related to the selection of prime simplicial complex per class. We perform experiments on the five simulated datasets by selecting a group of Rmax, followed by computing the corresponding R\n\u2217. The results are shown in Tab. 2 and Fig. 6. From the results we can see that when Rmax locates in an interval [0.3, 1], the classification performance are better. A reason is that the radius of these simulated datasets is close to 0.5. As a result, the topological structure can be preserved well when Rmax is selected around 0.5.\nFurthermore, we compare the NSC approaches with 1-NN, 3-NN and SVM methods in the five 2-class datasets. The reported results are shown in Tab. 2. It can be seen from Tab. 2 that in these five datasets, the NSC approaches are always better than 1-NN and 3-NN, and achieve competitive performance compared with SVM-G. It is worth noting that as illustrated in Fig. 4, our approaches also preserve reasonable structure representations to these data distributions."}, {"heading": "4.2 Small training samples and high-dimensional datasets", "text": "We test the proposed approaches on four multi-view object recognition datasets, each of which can be regarded as generating from a circle-shape structure. We use four different views per class (i.e., 0o, 90o, 180o and 270o) and eight views per class as the training set, respectively. The remaining images are used as the test set. Since the number of training samples is small, we set \u03b3 to be 1 to enhance the extrapolation ability of NSC, and employ Rips method [4] instead for the construction of prime simplicial complexes based on the whole training set. Here R is set to be 30. Note that R in Rips method is different from that in Lazywitness method. The results are shown in Tab. 3. From the results we can see that compared with NN and SVM algorithms, the proposed NSC approaches achieve the best performance in 4 out of 5 datasets. In SOIL-47B dataset, the performance of NSC is slightly worse than those of SVM algorithms. It indicates that the proposed NSC approaches can work well in high-dimensional multi-view structures. Note that here we haven\u2019t reported the results of NSC-M approach since the computation of covariance matrix is ill-posed when the number of samples is less than the dimension of a data set. Furthermore, we also observe that with 8 views as the training samples, our approach obtains the competitive performance as those state-of-art algorithms using 4 views in COIL and SOIL datasets [23]. However, the latter ones utilize very effective feature extraction and image registration techniques. In contrary, our approaches achieve a good tradeoff between recognition accuracy and topology preservation by only introducing additional 4 views."}, {"heading": "4.3 Face recognition", "text": "We compare our approaches with others in ORL [21] and UMIST [20] face recognition datasets.

In UMIST dataset, the images of each subject are taken by varying angles from left profile to right profile. We employ PCA to reduce the original dimensions to 40-dimensional subspaces since empirically, the subspaces preserve most of the principal structures. Furthermore, we also employ Rips method to construct the prime simplicial complexes based on the whole training set. The results are shown in Tab. 3.

With the significance level of 5%, the p-value of the paired t-test results for the NSC approaches in the 20 data sets are shown in Tab. 4. It indicates that NSC, 1-NN and SVM-G are statistically similar in these datasets.\nWe also want to discuss some limitations of the proposed approaches. Although our goal is to preserve the topological structure of datasets, first of all, the current persistent homology techniques can only provide some approximations to the \u2018truly\u2019 topological invariants, as our approaches do. It is also unclear that whether the topological structures indeed exist in the high-dimensional data sets. Secondly, the evaluation is to a certain extend unfair to our approaches since other approaches use the whole training sets to train their models, whereas due to the nature of witness complex, we have to select at most use 50% of the training sets as the landmark points to build our classification model for largescale training samples. Thirdly, the computational complexity is higher. Given the dimension is d, and the number of data set is n, specifically, the computational complexity of Rips complexes is O(d \u00b7 n2), and that of witness complexes is O(r \u00b7 d \u00b7 n2), where r is the ratio of the number of landmark points to n. Furthermore, the computational complexity of computing nearest distance from data point to the prime simplicial complexes is O(n2). When data are subject to Gaussian distribution, finally, the proposed approaches will lose their merits in recognizing objects."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We propose new structure-preserving NSC approaches by utilizing persistent homology technique in this paper.
