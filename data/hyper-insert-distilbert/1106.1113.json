The complexity of image analysis is usually due to the difficulties involved in discovering the nature of the relationship of these constituent elements. Surprisingly, species ranging from insects to mammals solve visual recognition problems extremely well. They have an inherent capacity to represent the temporal structure of experience, such information representation making it possible for an animal to adapt its behaviour to the temporal structure of an event in its behavioural space [9]. In particular, humans can recognize an object from a single presentation of its image without the necessity of integrating information over multiple time steps as would be required by classic machine learning paradigms. Indeed, the human perception system organizes information by using cohesive structures [13, 14]. Specifically, the human perception process always tries to assign structure to any perceptual information based upon previously stored knowledge structures (e.g. an image is recognized by identifying its structural components). This fact validates a well-known premise from\nthe machine learning field that states that the structure of an entity is very important for both classification and description. Furthermore, these ideas have motivated the development of a new branch of machine learning algorithms [7,8,10,15,17,19] that use structured representations (i.e. graph-based representations) of data for both classification and regression tasks instead of classic vector-based representations. For instance, an image can be represented by its region adjacency graph [1, 16] (see figure 1) which is extracted from the image by associating a node to each homogeneous region, and linking the nodes related to adjacent regions. In the region adjacency representation each node is labelled by a real vector, that represents features of the region (position, area, mean colour, texture, etc.). Thus, not only perceptual features of the image are captured with this representation but also its spatial arrangement. It is important to note that the notion of information content is strongly linked to the notion of structure.\nMoreover, image processing is done on the numerical representation of the image, i.e. a large matrix, therefore, these arrays can be enormous, and as soon as one deals with a sequence of images, such as in television or video applications, the volume of numerical data that must be processed becomes immense. Taking into account these considerations it can be deduced that the classification of large image data sets is a difficult computational task that becomes even more complex when dealing with structured representations of images. Therefore, from a machine learning point of view a great deal of research has been devoted to the development of fast computation learning schemes. In particular, for structured representations of data vario-eta through structure [3] has been recently proposed as an efficient learning scheme offering a good trade-off between speed of convergence and associated computational cost. Furthermore, this learning scheme achieves a rate of convergence similar to a quasi-Newton method at the computational cost of a first order method, and additionally, it offers the possibility of working in both sequential and in batch modes.\nThe present paper explores the reliability of this approximate second order stochastic gradient-based search optimization procedure for large scale learning problems. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section, some background topics on the vario-eta gradient-based optimization technique are introduced. Furthermore, the assumptions made by this optimization procedure are assessed from a theoretical point of view in order to check their reliability. Section 3 is devoted to the complexity analysis of the algorithm for structured domains. Specifically, the generating functions of the recursions associated to this learning scheme are analysed from an analytic combinatorics point of view. Section 4, is focused on the practical applications of the complexity analysis performed in section 3. Finally, section 5 provides a summary of the present study together with some concluding remarks."}, {"heading": "2 Vario-eta Learning Rule", "text": "The problem of learning in both deterministic and probabilistic machine learning models is frequently formulated in terms of parameter optimization techniques.

Then, model parameters are updated iteratively using the entire data set. In the sequential [14, 15] version of gradient descent, the error function gradient is evaluated for just one pattern (or a batch of patterns smaller when compared to the size of the data set for the case of the vario-eta learning rule) at a\ntime. Each update of model parameters can be viewed as perturbations (i.e. noise) around the current point given by the m dimensional vector of model parameters. Let us assume a given sequence of N disturbance vectors \u2206w.

The third term of expression (3) concerning the covariance can be ignored supposing that the elements of the disturbance vectors are uncorrelated over the index n. This is a plausible hypothesis given that patterns of the data set are selected randomly during the optimization procedure. Moreover, close to a local minimum we can assume that 0\u2245\u2206 iw .

This observation suggests that the error function should be strongly penalized around such model parameters. Therefore, to cancel the noise term in the expected value of the error function the gradient descent rule must be changed to \u2206wi = -\u03b7gi/\u03c3(gi). This normalization is known as vario-eta and was proposed in [20] for training neural networks.

Taking into account that N represents the size of the batch, the probability of such event is NM \u2212 , where M is the total size of the training set. It is important to note that in the batch version of gradient descent M=N.\nTherefore, such event can be ignored as its probability can be considered zero as in practice M>>N>>1. However, numerical precision errors could make the contribution of the term (7) big enough to break the validity of the hypothesis. This scenario would cause oscillations of the error E during the optimization procedure. Therefore, the approximation is limited in practice by the precision of the machine; although their impact is minimal, taking into account the precision achieved by current 64 bit platforms of modern computers. Moreover, in order to alleviate eventual numerical problems a small constant 0 <\u03c6 << 1 can be summed to the standard deviation of the error gradients (e.g. \u03c6 = 10-6) as suggested in [3]."}, {"heading": "3 Complexity Analysis", "text": "From a computational point of view machine learning models that work with structured representations of data are intrinsically more complex than their vectorbased counterparts are. The fact of using structured representations of data is translated into a substantial gain in information content but also in an increase on computational complexity. Indeed, the principal drawback of these models is an excessively expensive computational learning phase. The learning rule studied in the previous section was adapted and expressed in a recursive form in [3] for working with structured representations of data. The fact of expressing such calculations in a recursive form permitted a considerable reduction in memory storage something fundamental for learning problems composed of huge data sets.\nIn this section, a complexity analysis of such algorithm is performed using elements of the theory of analytic combinatorics [4, 6]. The main objective of analytic combinatorics is to provide quantitative predictions of the properties of large combinatorial structures. This theory has emerged over recent decades as an essential tool for the analysis of algorithms and for the study of scientific models in many disciplines.\nHere, our intention is to study the asymptotic behaviour of the learning rule to reduce its computational requirements for large-scale learning problems. To this end, in subsection 3.1, we firstly provide some background topics on analytic combinatorics.

Furthermore, they have an inherent combinatorial structure that can be modelled in terms of generating functions. In the following, we model the algorithmic description of the vario-eta learning rule in terms of generating functions.\nThe algorithmic description of the learning rule provided in [3] is composed of two recurrences expressed in matrix form. These two finite differences equations accounted for the calculation of the mean and variance of the error gradients during the gradient-descent optimization loop.

More specifically, the counting sequence ng is the result of computing the error gradient associated to a pattern randomly selected at iteration step n from the training set during the optimization loop. Therefore, we can consider each of them as n independent random variables. Furthermore, during the optimization loop the parameters of the machine learning model are not updated, therefore the n independent random variables representing the error gradients will be statistically equally distributed. It is important to note that the machine learning model can be viewed as a functional of the optimization parameters. Moreover, error gradients are calculated evaluating the functional by using the patterns of the data set. Taking into account we are interested in large-scale learning problems the statistical distribution of the averaged error gradients ng\u0302 will tend, by virtue of Laplace\u2019s central-limit theorem, to a Gaussian distribution at the extent the value of n increases. It is important to note that the value n represents the size of the data set for the case of batch learning and the size of the batch of patterns for sequential learning problems.

Additionally, it can be proved that )/1(\u02c6 zg is also analytic. Moreover, the function under the contour integral of expression (16) will be analytic in |z| < 1.

Figure 2 shows the result of computing the variance of a random variable. That is it shows the result of averaging n uniformly distributed random variables in the interval [0,1] for values of n (i.e. size of the data set), ranging from 500 up to 1000,000 (see the solid line style with squares) against the asymptotic approximation obtained in section 3 (see the dashed line style using diamonds at the sampling points).\nFrom inspection of the graph, it can be observed that the approximation works quite well for values of n bigger or equal to 50,000. For example, at n = 49,500 the error between the real value and its approximation is less than 10-5. Similarly, for n = 5,000 the error is less than 10-4. These results are of particular interest for huge data sets (i.e. n \u00a5 106) where batch learning becomes impractical even for sophisticated gradient-based acceleration techniques like conjugate-gradients methods [2, 11] due to the memory storage requirements and associated computational cost. Furthermore, these kinds of acceleration techniques are not available for sequential learning. In this regard, vario-eta offers the possibility of working in sequential and batch learning modes.\nLet us suppose that the size of the data set is M, and let us denote by N the size of the batch. The convergence of the learning rule in a sequential learning scenario is always guaranteed by the Robbins-Monro theorem [12] if the condition M>>N is satisfied. Therefore, under the hypothesis of a huge value of M if we further impose the condition N>>1 the asymptotic approximation (22) will hold, thus we can obtain for a large-scale sequential learning problem a speed of convergence of an approximate second order algorithm at an extremely reduced computational cost. Nevertheless, it is important to note that these theoretical results must be interpreted carefully as real-world data sets usually contains correlated patterns that could break\nin certain cases the independence assumption made in section 3. Hence, providing a more practical guideline for real-world data sets remains for future work."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have investigated the applicability of an approximate second order stochastic learning rule to large-scale learning problems.

The underlying idea is to consider that relevant information of an image is implicitly encoded into the relationships between more basic entities that compose by themselves the whole image. The classification problem is then reformulated in terms of an optimization problem usually solved by a gradient-based search procedure. Vario-eta through structure is an approximate second order stochastic optimization technique that achieves a good trade-off between speed of convergence and the computational effort required. However, the robustness of this technique for large scale problems has not been yet assessed. In this paper we firstly provide a theoretical justification of the assumptions made by this optimization procedure. Secondly, a complexity analysis of the algorithm is performed to prove its suitability for large scale learning problems.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
