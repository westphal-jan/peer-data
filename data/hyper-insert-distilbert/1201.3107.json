Introduction", "text": "In our living environment, tacit konwledge (as opposed to formal or explicit knowledge) is everywhere, which is usually difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalising it. With tacit knowledge, people are often aware of the knowledge they possess or how it can be valuable to others and effective transfer of tacit knowledge generally requires extensive personal contact and trust. According to Parsaye [1], there are three major approaches to capture the tacit knowledge from groups and individuals: (i) Interviewing experts: structured interviewing of experts in a particular subject is the most commonly used technique to capture pertinent, tacit knowledge; (ii) Learning by being told: this can be done by interviewing or by task analysis. And task analysis is the process of determining the actual task or policy by breaking it down and analyzing what needs to be done to complete the task; (iii) Learning by observation: this can be done by presenting the expert with a sample problem, scenario, or case study and then observing the process used to solve the problem.\nHowever, the above methods are more complicated to use and lack of rigorous mathematical foundation. In this paper, we select the concept lattice model to capture tacit knowledge through depicting and analyzing explicit knowledge. Concept lattice (also called\nCorresponding author: School of Mathematics and Information Science, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, Zhengzhou 450045, Henan, PR China E-mail addresses: yangli6672@sina.com\nformal concept analysis FCA) was proposed by Wille [2-4] in 1982\uff0cand its ideological core is constructing the binary relation between objects and attributes based on bivalent logic. Facing the massive fuzzy information existed in reality, fuzzy concept lattice has appeared [5-8], which is used to describe the fuzzy relation between objects and attributes. As a conceptual clustering method, concept lattices have been proved to benefit machine learning, information retrieval and knowledge discovery, etc.\nAs we all know, natural language is one of the most commonly direct ways that people express ideas and transmit information, especially for tacit konwledge. Linguistic truth-valued concept lattice researched in this paper, different from the classical concept lattice and the fuzzy concept lattice, is a new mathematical model for dealing with linguistic information, which is constructed based on the linguistic truth-valued lattice implication algebra. Its key point of this model is that its values range is not general interval [0,1] but a complete lattice structure, on which incomparability linguistic information can be considered very well. This selection of lattice implication algebra has two advantages in contrast to general structure: firstly, the computational process of linguistic truth-valued concepts is closed induced by the operations upon the lattice implication algebra; secondly, the complex derivation is avoided in setting up the Galois connection of linguistic truth-valued concept lattice. A large amount of research on linguistic truth-valued concept lattice may be referred to [9-13]. While for lattice implication algebra, Xu [14-16] proposed this concept by combining lattice and implication algebra in 1980\u2019s in order to depict uncertainty information more factually.\nBased on these analyses, this paper establishes a simplified linguistic truth-valued concept lattice and puts forward tacit knowledge mining algorithm based on it. Specifically, we firstly utlizes a six-element linguistic truth-valued lattice implication algebra to depict natural language and define the relevant operations among them; secondly establishes the simplified linguistic truth-valued concept lattice based on this algebraic structure and express knowledge by linguistic truth-valued context; finally captures tacit konwledge through mining the relations among explicit knowledge and gives the relevant mining algorithm. This algorithm not only provides us a relatively simple method but also can be used to improve the reduction ability of linguistic truth-valued concept lattice from another point of view [17-19]. In Section 2, we give an overview of classical concept lattice and lattice implication algebra. In Section 3, the related works of linguistic truth-valued concept lattice are briefly summarized. Successively, the definitions of linguistic truth-valued attribute extended context and congener context are proposed in Section 4, where we show the relevant attribute extended judgment theorems based on congener context and give the generation algorithms of attribute extended context and linguistic truth-valued concepts, respectively. Concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.\n2. Concept lattice and lattice implication algebra\nIn this section, we review briefly the classical concept lattices and lattice implication algebra and they are the foundations of constructing the linguistic truth-valued concept lattice.\nDefinition 2.1 ( [2] ) A partial ordered set (poset) is a set in which a binary relation\u2264 is defined, which satisfies the following conditions: for any , ,x y z ,\n(1). x x\u2264 , for any x (Reflexive), (2). x y\u2264 and impliesy x\u2264 x y= ( Antisymmetry ), (3). x y\u2264 and y z\u2264 implies x z\u2264 ( Transitivity ).\nDefinition 2.2 ( [2] ) Let L be an arbitrary set, and let there be given two binary operations on L , denoted by and . Then the structure \u2227 \u2228 ( , , )L \u2227 \u2228 is an algebraic structure with two binary operations. We call the structure ( , , )L \u2227 \u2228 a lattice provided that it satisfies the following\nproperties: (1). For any , ,x y z L\u2208 , ( ) ( )x y z x y z\u2227 \u2227 = \u2227 \u2227 and ( ) ( )x y z x y z\u2228 \u2228 = \u2228 \u2228 (2). For any ,x y L\u2208 , x y y x\u2227 = \u2227 and x y y x\u2228 = \u2228 .\n(3). For any x L\u2208 , x x x\u2227 = and x x x\u2228 = . (4). For any ,x y L\u2208 , ( )x x y x\u2227 \u2228 = and ( )x x y x\u2228 \u2227 = .\nDefinition 2.3 ( [4] ) The formal context of classical concept lattice is defined as a set structure consisting of sets and ( , ,G M I ) G M and a binary relation . The elements of\nand I G M\u2286 \u00d7\nG M are called objects and attributes, respectively, and the relationship gIm is read: the object g has the attribute m. For a set of objects A G\u2286 \uff0cA* is defined as the set of features shared by all the objects in A , that is, A* = {m M\u2208 gIm }g A\u2200 \u2208 . Similarly, for B M\u2286 , B* is defined as the set of objects that posses all the features in B, that is, B*={g G\u2208 gIm }m B\u2200 \u2208 .\nDefinition 2.4 ( [4] ) A formal concept of the context ( ), ,G M I is defined as a pair ( ),A B with A G\u2286 , B M\u2286 and A*= , BB *= A . The set A is called the extent and the intent of the concept ( ) B ,A B .\nDefinition 2.5 ( [14] ) Let ( , , , , )L O I\u2227 \u2228 be a bounded lattice with an order-reversing involution , ' I and the greatest and the smallest element of O L respectively, and be a mapping. If the following conditions hold for any: L L L\u2192 \u00d7 \u2192 , ,x y z L\u2208 : (1) ( ) ( )x y z y x z\u2192 \u2192 = \u2192 \u2192 (2) x x I\u2192 = (3) x y y x\u2032 \u2032\u2192 = \u2192 (4) x y y x I\u2192 = \u2192 = implies x y= (5) ( ) ( )x y y y x\u2192 \u2192 = \u2192 \u2192 x\n) (6) ( ) ( ) (x y z x z y z\u2228 \u2192 = \u2192 \u2227 \u2192 (7) ( ) ( ) ( )x y z x z y z\u2227 \u2192 = \u2192 \u2228 \u2192 then is called a lattice implication algebra (LIA).

Conclusions", "text": "As the theoretical premise of effective mining tacit knowledge, our research about the model construction of 6-ary linguistic truth-valued concept lattice is helpful to provide a useful mathmatical tool. From the definitions of attribute extended context and congener context, this paper researches the necessary and sufficient conditions of generating tacit knowledge, and under this condition, we can obtain the invariable structure of linguistic truth-valued concept lattice. The algorithms of generating linguistic truth-valued context and of establishing linguistic truth-valued concept lattice based on these conditions are proposed.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of P.R.
