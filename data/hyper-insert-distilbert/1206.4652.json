Consequently, machine learning and data mining research has developed a large number of methods to analyze given graph structures and to identify substructures of predefined properties, in particular cliques, i.e. subsets of vertices that are fully connected with respect to the graph\u2019s edge set.\nIn this work, we extend this reasoning to the case where multiple, potentially noisy or incomplete, instances of a graph are available for analysis. The hard criterion of a set of vertices being fully connected becomes too limiting in this case, so instead we look for persistent soft-cliques, i.e. subgraphs that are almost fully or at least densely connected, and that persists through all or most instances of the graph. For given several instances of a weighted graph, we are interested to find a persistent soft-clique with the highest weight. We call this a most persistent soft-clique problem.\nBy solving the most persistent clique problem we can extend a wide range of applications that relied on finding cliques in graphs to situations where a collection of graphs is available, e.g. measurements at different points of times, but where each graph instance might have a different edge set, e.g. due to noisy or incomplete observations. These noisy snapshots of the same graph pose challenging tasks related to inconsistent patterns, but could give us more confidence in characterizing the inherent pattern or phenomenon. Take as an illustrative example, the usage of dense subgraphs in mobile phone or location-based social networks to identify groups of friends or families. A temporal dimension arises naturally for such a graph where, for example, different hours in a day lead to several samples of the graphs. It is reasonable to assume that\ndense subgraphs that appear in all of the samples of the graphs are the groups of friends or families that we would like to identify. However, it can also be expected that in each individual observation of the graphs not every person will be observed within the subgraph: he or she could have left the group temporarily due to other commitments, or the measurement itself could be faulty, e.g. due to a network outage.\nContribution In this work, we make the following contributions: 1) We introduce a simple clique-ness measure that is suitable for finding a persistent softclique across multiple noisy instances of a graph. Intuitively, the measure counts and penalizes the number of edges missing to make the selected subset of vertices into a clique. 2) We show how this measure can be used in an optimization framework either as a two person game or as a relaxation of the hard-clique problem with slack variables, to find a maximum weighted persistent soft-clique. 3) We show that both formulations lead to the same solution when using a partial Lagrangian method to solve the optimization problems: the upper bound obtained for the max-min two player game formulation coincides with the lower bound of the min-min slack formulation. 4) We perform an experiment on synthetic data and provide an application in social network data where the graphs are sampled across time.\nFirst, however, we give a short overview of related work to provide some context for our contributions."}, {"heading": "1.1. Related Work", "text": "The first work on the use of cliques in social network graphs by far predates recent efforts in machine learning, data mining or network science. Luce & Perry (1949) studied adjacency matrices of friendship graphs in order to identify cliques of friends. They already observed that the criterion of all vertices being connected to each other can be overly strict, and they introduced the softer n-clique criterion. Later, Alba (1973) showed, however, some non-intuitive facts about n-cliques, e.g. that their elements might be completely disconnected with respect to the original graph structure. Afterwards, many alternative constructions were introduced, see, e.g., (Scott, 1988) for a textbook overview, and (Brunato et al., 2008; Robardet, 2009) for some recent developments. Besides the social sciences, other areas of research that deal with network structured data have adopted the search for cliques as part of their research methodology, in particular bioinformatics, chemistry and (electrical) engineering. Mathematics, on the other hand, studied properties of graphs and subgraphs more formally, through the anal-\nysis of function optima defined on the graph (Motzkin & Straus, 1965), or statistical properties of graphs with random edge sets (Bolloba\u0301s, 2001). In theoretical computer science and operations research graph-based algorithms are today objects of core interest, e.g. in the analysis of their computational complexity, or as tools to abstractly model the process of computation in a computer itself.\nWith the rise of machine learning and data mining, a lot of more applied work on identifying structure within graphs of empirical data has emerged, see, e.g., (Schaeffer, 2007) for a survey. For example, Gupta & Ghosh (2005) and Crammer et al. (2008) looked at a one-class clustering or classification problem which, given a dataset, aims at identifying a coherent yet small subset of data points. This one-class clustering problem finds itself applications in bioinformatics to find gene modules and natural language to extract documents\u2019 topics. Pavan & Pelillo (2007) use the weighted version of maximal (non-extendable) clique to perform a pairwise clustering. In a recent time, the maximum weighted clique concept has also found increased use in computer vision problems for performing image segmentation tasks, for example (Brendel & Todorovic, 2010; Ion et al., 2011).\nWhile all the above learning methods rely on only a single (noisy) graph to be analyzed, it is intuitive that having access to multiple observations should make the result of the analysis more robust against random effects, missing observations, and outliers. Achieving this intuition is our goal for the rest of the paper."}, {"heading": "2. Persistent Soft-Cliques", "text": "In this section we formulate our main contributions: a measure how close a set of vertices is to being a clique, and its generalization to multiple graph instances. First, we introduce the necessary notation for this. In Section 2.1, we cast the problem of finding a maximal clique in a single graph as an integer optimization problem, and in Section 2.2 we extend this notion to the case of soft-cliques persisting across multiple instances of a graph.\nNotation For a set of vertices V = {v1, . . . , vn}, let Et \u2286 V \u00d7V, for t = 1, . . . , T , be multiple observed sets of edges, and let kt : V \u00d7V \u2192 R+ denote non-negative weight functions between the vertices of V. We form weighted graphs Gt = (V, Et, kt), for t = 1, . . . , T . In the following, we will refer to t as a \u2018time\u2019 variable, but note that this is meant in a broad sense: while t = 1, . . . , T can correspond to an actual temporal sequence, it can also just denote different instances of a\ngraphs in arbitrary order. Furthermore, we will interpret the values of kt(vi, vj) as measures of similarity between vertices, e.g. given by a positive definite kernel function (Scho\u0308lkopf & Smola, 2001), but the method we describe does not depend on kt having any specific structure."}, {"heading": "2.1. Soft Clique-ness", "text": "In the following, we will define a measure of cliqueness. Let S \u2282 V be a vertex subset. For this, we identify S with its binary indicator vector xi \u2208 {0, 1}|V|, where xi = 1 if vi \u2208 S, and xi = 0 otherwise. The problem of finding a maximum weighted clique in a weighted graph (V, E , k) can then be cast as the following integer optimization problem (Pardalos & Xue, 1994):\nmax x\u2208{0,1}|V| \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjk(vi, vj) (1a)\nsubject to \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\nxixjI[(i, j) /\u2208 E ] = 0. (1b)\nIn the above, we make use of Iverson\u2019s bracket notation: I[P ] = 1 for the condition P is true and it is 0 otherwise. The constraint enforces that any two variables in the selected subset are connected by an edge, i.e. the subgraph given by x is a clique. For a nonnegative weight function k(\u00b7, \u00b7), the above optimization also ensures that the inferred clique is maximal, i.e. no extension of the clique by adding one or more vertices is possible.\nFor graphs based on noisy observations it is clear that the constraint (1b) is too strict: a single missing edge will exclude a subset of vertices from further consideration. Instead it makes sense to look for soft-cliques, i.e. subgraphs that are almost fully or at least densely connected. To formalize this, we observe that the left hand side of the clique-constraint (1b) has a simple interpretation: for any fixed x \u2208 {0, 1}|V|,\n\u03b2 := \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\nxixjI[(i, j) /\u2208 E ] (2)\ncounts how many edges are missing in E for the selected vertices to be a clique. Consequently, we will use Equation (2) as a measure of how far a set of vertices is from being a clique: for a set with k elements, \u03b2 can take values between 0 (x is a clique), and ( k 2\n) (x is a completely disconnected), see Figure 1 for an illustration."}, {"heading": "2.2. Persistency of a Clique over Time", "text": "Given multiple instances of a graph, Gt = (V, Et, kt), for t = 1, . . . , T , finding a clique x \u2208 {0, 1}|V| that\npersists through time is a straight-forward extension of the above single-graph case. We enforce the clique constraint (1b) simultaneously in all time slices, yielding the optimization problem\nmax x\u2208{0,1}|V| \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjk(vi, vj) (3a)\nsubject to \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\nxixjI[(i, j) /\u2208 Et] = 0, \u2200t = 1, . . . , T,\n(3b) where k(vi, vj) = \u2211 t kt(vi, vj) encodes the total similarity of vertices during the time of consideration. Deriving an analogue soft-clique formulation is less straight-forward, since at different time steps, a different subset of edges might be missing to make a set of vertices a clique. In the next sections we present two ways to formalize the concept of a finding a softclique that persists over time. Subsequently, we will show that both formulation lead to identical solutions if solved in a Lagrangian relaxation framework.\nSlack Perspective We start by making each of the hard-cliques constraints Equation(3b) into a softclique constraints by introducing slack variables, \u03b2t, for t = 1, . . . , T , on the right hand side. To avoid degenerate solutions, we penalize the resulting slack vector \u03b2 = (\u03b21, . . . , \u03b2T ) in the objective function by a multiple of its Lp-norm for some p \u2265 1. For reasons that will become clear later we furthermore replace the maximization by a minimization of the negative objective. This leads to the following optimization problem\nmin x\u2208{0,1}|V| min \u03b2\u2208RT+\n\u2212 \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjk(vi, vj) + \u03b7\u2016\u03b2\u2016pLp\n(4a) subject to \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\nxixjI[(i, j) /\u2208 Et] \u2264 \u03b2t \u2200t = 1, . . . , T.\n(4b)\nNote that the form of (4) also allows interpretation as a regularized risk functional : \u2016\u03b2t\u2016pLp is a loss term that measures how bad the choice of x is as candidate for a most persistent soft-clique. The term \u2212 \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjk(vi, vj) acts as a regularizer that encourages the opposite direction: minimizing it requires as many vertices as possible to be selected, in particular those that have high similarity values. The variable \u03b7 is a trade-off parameter that controls the relative influence of loss and regularization terms. Intuitively, by solving (4) we look for the optimal balance between the goal of collecting as many similar vertices, and the goal to not include vertices that are frequently disconnected.\nTwo-Person Game Perspective Alternatively, we can view the spatio-temporal cliques identification as a game of two competing players: inlier and outlier. The inlier player controls x \u2208 {0, 1}|V| and aims at finding a group of variables with as large weight as possible. The outlier aims at reducing the objective value by controlling variables \u03b21, . . . , \u03b2T , which he or she can increase up a limit given by the number of edges missing to make x a clique. Mathematically, this game is expressed by the following optimization problem:\nmax x\u2208{0,1}|V| min \u03b2\u2208RT+ \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjk(vi, vj)\u2212 \u2211 t \u03b2pt (5a)\nsubject to, for all t = 1, . . . , T ,\u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjI[(i, j) /\u2208 Et] \u2265 \u03b2t (5b)\nfor some p \u2265 1. The intuition behind this resembles the one above: one player aims at forming sets with many similar vertices, the other player aims at excluding vertices if they are disconnected in many of the graph instances."}, {"heading": "3. The Optimization", "text": "The key idea to solve the optimization problems in (4) and (5) is to relax the soft clique-ness constraint further. We replace the clique-ness constraint by a Lagrangian. This does not ensure that we will be able to meet the clique-ness constraints exactly anymore. We will instead only be able to state ex-post that the relaxed solution is optimal for the observed clique-ness distribution."}, {"heading": "3.1. Lagrange Relaxations", "text": "In the following, we will show that slack and twoperson game formulations lead to the same solution\nwhen using a partial Lagrangian method to solve the optimization problems: the lower bound of the minmin slack formulation coincides with the upper bound obtained for the two player game formulation.\nLower Bound of Slack Perspective By weak duality theorem (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004), we arrive at the following lower bound of (4):\nmax \u03bb\u2208RT+ min x\u2208{0,1}|V|,\u03b2\u2208RT+\n\u2212 \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\nxixjk(vi, vj)\n+ \u03b7\u2016\u03b2\u2016pLp + \u2211 t \u03bbt  \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjI[(i, j) /\u2208 Et]\u2212 \u03b2t  . (6)\nUpper Bound of Game Perspective Similarly with the bound on slack perspective, by weak duality, we have the following upper bound of (5):\nmin \u03bb\u2208RT\u2212 max x\u2208{0,1}|V| min \u03b2\u2208RT+ \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjk(vi, vj)\n\u2212 \u2211 t \u03b2pt + \u2211 t \u03bbt  \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjI[(i, j) /\u2208 Et]\u2212 \u03b2t  (7)\nA standard approach to dualize the problem of (6) and (7) is to eliminate the primal variables x and \u03b2. We take the approach to partially dualize the problem by only finding the stationary point with respect to the primal variables \u03b2. In this paper, we give explicit formulation for the case of p = 1 and p = 21. The p = 1 case leads to a maximum weighted clique in a single graph with modified weight functions, and the p = 2 case leads to a series of maximum weighted clique problems.\n`1 Soft Clique-ness Measure For simplicity of presentation, in what follows, we show the case for the trade-off parameter \u03b7 = 1. In (6), taking the point where the gradient with respect to \u03b2t vanishes leads to the dual variables take the form of \u03bbt = +1 for t = 1, . . . , T . Similarly, for (7), the vanishing gradient point leads to \u03bbt = \u22121 for t = 1, . . . , T . Plugging this constraint on the dual variables back to the (6) and (7) leads us to the following problem:\nmax x\u2208{0,1}|V| \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixj\n{ k(vi, vj)\u2212\n\u2211 t I[(i, j) /\u2208 Et]\n} .\n(8)\n1One could also choose p = \u221e which leads to a single global variable \u03b2. However, this choice is not robust against missing edges as a single instance with an empty edge set would render the whole procedure vacuous.\nAlgorithm 1 `1 Soft Clique-ness Measure\nInput A spatio-temporal graph Gt(V, Et, kt) Compute the total similarity, k(i, j) = \u2211 t kt(i, j)\nCompute the measure, c(i, j) = \u2211 t I[(i, j) /\u2208 Et] Solve argmax x { xTKx\u2212 xTCx } with Ki,j = k(i, j) and Ci,j = c(i, j) Return x \u2208 {0, 1}|V|\nThe above problem takes the appealing form of a maximum weighted clique optimization with the readjusted weight functions taking into account the number of missing edges to make group of vertices into a clique. Finding the maximum weighted clique is NPcomplete and hard to approximate to a given bound (Pardalos & Xue, 1994). Numerous heuristics have been proposed to obtain local solutions, and eventually the best performing strategy often depends on the application. For a very small graph, any integer programming solvers, such as CPLEX, can in principle be used to solve (8). In our case, we deal with graphs of moderate to large size. For this reason, we use the Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization with Probing (QPBOP) solver2 of Rother et al. (2007).\n`2 Soft Clique-ness Measure Similarly to the `1 case, we find the point where the gradient with respect to \u03b2t vanishes leads to the dual variables take the form of \u03bbt = 2\u03b7\u03b2t for (6) and \u03bbt = \u22122\u03b2t for (7). We again use this to eliminate the primal variables \u03b2t. The optimization problem of (6) is now in the form of3:\nmax \u03bb\u2208RT+ min x\u2208{0,1}|V|\n\u2212 \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\nxixjk(vi, vj)\n\u2212 1 4\u03b7 \u2211 t \u03bb2t + \u2211 t \u03bbt  \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjI[(i, j) /\u2208 Et]  . (9)\nThe problem (9) is concave quadratic with respect to the dual variables given all the binary indicator variables x, and is in the form of standard maximum weighted clique problem with respect to the indicator variables given the dual variables \u03bb. With these observations, to solve (9), we pursue an alternating approach:\n\u2022 Step 1: given all the dual variables, solve the following maximum weighted clique problem\n2http://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html 3Problem (7) leads to the same form with different con-\nstant in front of the term \u2211\nt \u03bb 2 t .\nAlgorithm 2 `2 Soft Clique-ness Measure\nInput A spatio-temporal graph Gt(V, Et, kt), number of iterations N , regularization constant \u03b7 Compute the total similarity, k(i, j) = \u2211 t kt(i, j) for i = 1 to N do Compute the measure, c(i, j) = \u2211 t \u03bbtI[(i, j) /\u2208 Et]\nSolve argmax x\n{ xTKx\u2212 xTCx } with Ki,j =\nk(i, j) and Ci,j = c(i, j) Update \u03bbt \u2190 2\u03b7 \u2211 ij xixjI[(i, j) /\u2208 Et]\nend for Return x \u2208 {0, 1}|V|\nmin x\u2208{0,1}|V| \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixj\n{ \u2212k(vi, vj) +\n\u2211 t \u03bbtI[(i, j) /\u2208 Et]\n} .\n\u2022 Step 2: subsequently, given the indicator variables, update dual variables with a closed-form solution, \u03bbt = 2\u03b7 \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264n xixjI[(i, j) /\u2208 Et].\nThe above two steps are repeated until certain number of alternating steps is reached. The initialization plays a crucial role for this alternating approach. We set all the dual variables to zeros at the start. Those dual variables that are associated with the time slices where the clique-ness constraints are not violated (there are no missing edges) will stay at zeros (this is a complementary slackness of necessary KKT condition for the optimal points (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004))."}, {"heading": "4. Experiments", "text": "We perform two experiments to assess the efficacy of our soft clique-ness measure: first on synthetic data where a collection of noisy snapshots of the same graph is observed, and second on real location-based social network graph where we would like to identify a clique of friends.

Synthetic Data", "text": "We generate the data in the following ways: a) At time 1, we draw 18 2D data points from a mixture of 3 Gaussian distributions where 7 samples drawn from N ([0, 0], 1.0I), 6 samples drawn from N ([\u22126, 3], 2.0I), and 5 points sampled from N ([8,\u22123], 2.0I), b) For time t = 2, . . . , T , we add to each point of the initial graph, at each time slice, an independent Gaussian noise. This procedure simulates the situation where inconsistent patterns are observed in the several shots\n4The code is available at http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/\n~nquadrianto/.\nof the initial graph depending on the amount of noise.\nWe produce 4 sets of synthetic data with the above procedure. Syn.Data A and Syn.Data B have 3 time slices where at time 2 a noise of N ([0, 0], 10.0I) is added, and at time 3 a noise of N ([0, 0], 0.8I) is introduced for A and N ([0, 0], 10.0I) is introduced for B. We repeat the data generation process 10 times. Figure 2 shows examples of draws from this process. Syn.Data C has 5 time slices and is corrupted by the same noise as A and B at time 2. Subsequently, the noises at time 3, 4, and 5 are N ([0, 0], 2.0I), N ([0, 0], 5.0I), andN ([0, 0], 0.8I), respectively. Lastly, there are 7 time slices at Syn.Data D, with the same type of corrupted noises as C for the first four time slices, and the last two time slices have N ([0, 0], 2.5I) and N ([0, 0], 0.5I) random noises.\nWe run our `1 (refer to Algorithm 1) and `2 (refer to Algorithm 2) soft clique-ness measure methods on the generated synthetic data. We use a Gaussian RBF kernel k(vi, vj) = exp(\u2212 1\u03c32 \u2016vi \u2212 vj\u2016 2 `2 ) with the kernel width \u03c32 set to the median distance (Scho\u0308lkopf, 1997),\nas the similarity function. Some visualizations of the results of our algorithms are depicted in Figure 2. As a baseline, we use the graph shift algorithm proposed in (Liu & Yan, 2010)5. This algorithm finds a mode, i.e. a dense subgraph, on a single graph (Pavan & Pelillo, 2007). We can extend this algorithm to work on samples of graphs by simply finding the mode defined by the temporal average of similarity or affinity matrices. The graph shift returns different local modes depending on different initializations. We use the default setting, which use each vertex as one initialization, and choose the output with the best score. We use the Jaccard Index (Jaccard, 1901), J(X, X\u0302) = |X\u2229X\u0302||X\u222aX\u0302| for a predicted set of fully connected vertices X\u0302 while a true clique is X, as an evaluation metric. The empirical results are summarized in Table 1. The soft clique-ness measure is clearly important for handling inconsistent patterns inherent in the data. Evidently, our `1 and `2 soft clique-ness measure methods also produce lower variances in the Jaccard Index metric in\n5http://sites.google.com/site/lhrbss/\ncomparison to the graph shift algorithm. As expected, our two algorithms will (mostly) recover the same solutions. It is also observed that a collection of snapshots of the same graph could give us more confidence of the clique pattern, for example the mean Jaccard Index in Syn.Data D is higher than in Syn.Data B ."}, {"heading": "4.2. Real Social Network Data", "text": "In this experiment, we are interested to apply our clique-ness measure to the samples of real network graphs for identifying a soft-clique of friends.\nData We use a Brightkite location-based social network graph6. The network contains data of users\u2019 \u201dcheck-ins\u201d where users shared their locations by using text messaging or other mobile applications. The numbers of check-ins varies widely among users, thus we filter the data and only use data from persons with above average number of check-ins. This leaves us with 4, 429 persons or nodes and 9, 805, 806 connections.\nSet Kernels Exploiting studies in Cho et al. (2011) that mobility patterns of humans are mostly periodic (moving back and forth between homes and workplaces) and the remaining patterns could be explained by social relationships, we define different after -hours in a day as samples of the graphs. Specifically, we uniformly divide the hours between 17 : 00 and midnight into 7 time slices. Each person or node now is represented as a vector of location and date of checkin. To define kernels between persons in this (locationdate)-based representation, we are faced with the challenge that persons are represented by different numbers of locations at different dates depending on how (ir)-regular their check-ins behaviors. We pursue a solution of representing a person with a set or a bag of vectors. In this paper, we use the following set kernel between x = {x1, . . . , xn} and y = {y1, . . . , ym}: kset = \u2211n i=1 \u2211m j=1 kbase(xi, yj), where xi and yi are\n6http://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-brightkite. html\nthe persons (location-date) descriptors. A Gaussian RBF is used as the base kernel.\nDiagonal Dominance We observe that our set kernel matrices at each time slice are diagonally dominant, i.e. a person tends to be much more similar to himself or herself than to others. Sub-polynomial kernels (Scho\u0308lkopf et al., 2003) are designed to specifically address such diagonal dominance issue. This subpolynomial kernel is generated as follows: first each element of the original kernel matrix is raised to the power of p where 0 < p < 1. This procedure reduces the dynamic range of the original kernel as elements that are less than one will be increased, whereas elements that are greater than one will be decreased. Then, the rows of the modified kernel is normalized to a unit length (let K\u0302 denote this transformed kernel matrix), and lastly, our sub-polynomial kernel matrix is K\u0302K\u0302>. The last step is needed to make the modified kernel matrix to be a positive definite matrix.\nResults Our `1 method run for about an hour and produce a soft-clique of friend of the size 1754. We observe that our identified clique explains 23% of the friendship network that was collected based on the online public API. The graph shift algorithm did not finish in a week time. We thus randomly select 1754 nodes to form a clique and find that the random clique explains only 14% of the online friendship network."}, {"heading": "5. Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced the concept of persistent softcliques, i.e., subgraphs that are almost fully or at least densely connected, and that persists through all or most instances of the graph. This concept is particularly useful to characterize key patterns more confidently when multiple instances of a graph are available for analysis. We presented a soft clique-ness measure, that counts and penalizes the number of edges missing to make the selected subgraphs into a clique, to handle inconsistent patterns inherent in noisy graph instances. When this measure is used in an optimization framework to find a maximum weighted clique, we end up at a two-person game or a slack formulation. We showed using a Lagrangian method that the two formulations lead to the same solution.\nOur experiments on randomly generated inconsistent patterns in several shots of the initial graph confirmed that a collection of, though noisy, snapshots of the same graph can give us more confidence of the clique pattern, and our clique-ness measure is important for such situation. We also provided experiments on a\nprototypical application of our method: identifying groups of friends or families from a location-based social network graph where the sampling of graphs correspond to an after -hour temporal dimension. Our clique-ness measure helped to recover more than 20% of the online friendship network.\nDespite encouraging results in our experiments, we have clearly only touched the surface of possibilities to be explored. Particularly, we are interested to explore the case where vertex correspondences between time slices are a priori unknown. In such situation, we need to jointly infer the key patterns and the correspondences, specifically a mutual information like dependency measure can be used for the latter. Furthermore, we intend to introduce a pairwise coupling over time slices via a Markov model. This model will allow us to distinguish the case where edges disappear for a while and then come back to the case where edges randomly flip on and off."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank Ahmed Jawad, Marcello Pelillo, Zoubin Ghahramani, Adrian Ion, Tiberio Caetano, and Viktoriia Sharmanska for discussions.

However, it turns out that the inconsistencies introduced when different graph instances have different edge sets pose a serious challenge. In this work we address this challenge for the problem of finding maximum weighted cliques. We introduce the concept of most persistent soft-clique. This is subset of vertices, that 1) is almost fully or at least densely connected, 2) occurs in all or almost all graph instances, and 3) has the maximum weight. We present a measure of clique-ness, that essentially counts the number of edge missing to make a subset of vertices into a clique. With this measure, we show that the problem of finding the most persistent soft-clique problem can be cast either as: a) a max-min two person game optimization problem, or b) a min-min soft margin optimization problem. Both formulations lead to the same solution when using a partial Lagrangian method to solve the optimization problems. By experiments on synthetic data and on real social network data we show that the proposed method is able to reliably find soft cliques in graph data, even if that is distorted by random noise or unreliable observations.
