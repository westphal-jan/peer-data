A key issue in this ap\u00ad proach is the definition of similarity between user preferences. We introduced the prob\u00ad abilistic distance as a measure of similarity on user preferences, and provided an algo\u00ad rithm to compute the distance between two partially specified value functions. This is for the case of decision making under certainty. In this paper we address the more challenging issue of computing the probabilistic distance in the case of decision making under uncer\u00ad tainty. We present algorithms to compute the probabilistic distance between two com\u00ad pletely or partially specified utility functions. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm with a medical data set of partially specified patient preferences, where none of the other existing distance measures appear definable. Using this data set, we also demonstrate that the case-based approach to preference elici\u00ad tation is applicable in domains with uncer\u00ad tainty.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
