The problem is best de\u00ad scribed in terms of future buy and sell contracts. By buying less reliable, but less expensive, buy (supply) contracts, a company or a trader can cover a position of more reliable and more expen\u00ad sive sell contracts. The goal is to maximize the expected net gain (profit) by constructing a close to optimum portfolio out of the available buy and sell contracts. This stochastic planning problem can be formulated as a two-stage stochastic linear programm ing problem with recourse.
