The expressive richness of quantities such entropy or mutual information has been shown to be very useful for machine learning problems where optimality based on linear and Gaussian assumptions no longer holds. Nevertheless, operational quantities in information theory are based on the probability laws underlying the data generation process, which are rarely known in the statistical learning setting where the only information available comes from the sample {zi}ni=1. Therefore, the use of information theoretic quantities as descriptors of data requires the development of suitable estimators. In [1], the use of Renyi\u2019s definition of entropy along with Parzen density estimation is proposed as the main tool for information theoretic learning (ITL). The optimality criteria is expressed in terms of quantities such as Renyi\u2019s entropy, divergences based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, quadratic mutual information, among others. Part of the research effort in this context has pointed out connections to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces [2]. Here, we show that these connections are not only valuable from a theoretical point of view, but they can also be exploited to derive novel information theoretic quantities with suitable estimators from data.\nPositive definite kernels have been employed in machine learning as a representational tool allowing algorithms that are based on inner products to be expressed in a rather generic way (the so called \u201ckernel trick\u201d). Algorithms that exploit this property are commonly known as kernel methods. Let X be a nonempty set. A function \u03ba : X \u00d7X 7\u2192 R is called a positive definite kernel if for any finite set {xi}Ni=1 \u2286 X and any set of coefficients {\u03b1i}Ni=1 \u2282R, it follows that \u2211i, j \u03b1i\u03b1 j\u03ba(xi,x j)\u2265 0, if at least one i, \u03b1i 6= 0. In this case, there exist an implicit mapping \u03c6 : X 7\u2192 H that maps any element x \u2208 X to an element \u03c6(x) in a Hilbert space H , such that \u03ba(x,y) = \u3008\u03c6(x),\u03c6(y)\u3009. The above map provides an implicit representation of the objects of interest that belong to the set X . The generality of this representation has been exploited in many practical applications, even for data that do not come in standard vector representation Rd [3]. This is possible as long as a kernel function is available.\nMore recently, it has been noticed that kernel induced maps are also useful beyond the above kernel trick in a rather interesting fashion. Namely, kernels can be utilized to compute higher-order statistics of the data in a nonparametric setting. Some examples exploring this idea are: kernel independent component analysis [4], the work on measures of dependence and independence using Hilbert-Schmidt norms [5], and the quadratic measures of independence proposed in [6]. It is not surprising, yet important to mention, that a similar observation have also been reached from the work on ITL since one of the original motivations in using information theoretic quantities is to go beyond second order statistics. The work we introduce in this paper goes along these lines. The twist is that rather than defining an estimator of a conventional information theoretic quantity such as Shannon entropy, we propose a quantity build from the data that satisfies similar axiomatic properties to those of well establish definitions such as Renyi\u2019s definition of entropy\nThe main contribution of this work is to show that the Gram matrix obtained from evaluating a positive definite kernel on samples can be used to define a quantity based on the data with properties similar to those of an entropy without assuming that the probability density is being estimated. Therefore, we look at the axiomatic treatment of entropy and adapt it to the Gram matrices describing the data. In this sense, we think about entropy as a measure inversely related to the amount of statistical regularities (structure) directly from the data that can be applied as the optimality criterion in a learning algorithm. As an application example, we derive supervised metric learning algorithm that uses conditional entropy as the cost function. This is the second contribution of this paper, and the empirical results show that the proposed method is competitive with current approaches. The main body of the paper is organized in two parts. First, we introduce the proposed matrix-based entropy measure using the spectral theorem along with a set of axiomatic properties that our quantity must satisfy. Then, the notion of joint entropy is developed based on Hadamard products. We look at some basic inequalities of information and how they translate to the setting of positive definite matrices, which finally allow us to define an analogue to conditional entropies. In the development of these ideas, we find that the concept of infinitely divisible kernels arises and become key to our purposes. We revisit some of the theory on infinitely divisible matrices, to show how it links to the the proposed information theoretic framework. In the last part, we introduce an information theoretic supervised metric learning algorithm. We show how the proposed analogue to conditional entropy is a suitable cost function leading naturally to a gradient descent procedure. Finally, we provide some conclusions and future directions."}, {"heading": "2 Positive Definite Matrices, and Renyi\u2019s Entropy Axioms", "text": "Let us start with an informal observation that motivated our matrix based entropy. In [1], the use of Renyi\u2019s entropy is proposed as an alternative to the more commonly adopted definition of entropy given by Shannon. In particular, it was found that Renyi\u2019s second-order entropy provides an amenable quantity for practical purposes. An empirical plug in estimator of Renyi\u2019s second-order entropy based on the Parzen density estimator f\u0302 (x) = 1n \u2211 n i=1 \u03ba(xi,x), can be obtained as follows:\n\u2212 log 1 n2\nn\n\u2211 i, j=1 h(xi,x j), (1)\nwhere h(x,y) = \u222b X \u03ba\u03c3 (x,z)\u03ba\u03c3 (y,z)dz. Note that since h is a positive definite kernel, there exists a mapping \u03c6 to a RKHS such that h(x,y) = \u3008\u03c6(x),\u03c6(y)\u3009; and the argument of the log in (1), called the information potential, can be interpreted in this space as a norm:\n\u2329\n1 n\nn\n\u2211 i=1 \u03c6(xi), 1 n\nn\n\u2211 i=1 \u03c6(xi)\n\u232a\n=\n\u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 1 n n \u2211 i=1 \u03c6(xi) \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 2 , (2)\nwith the limiting case given by \u2016E[\u03c6(X)]\u20162. Thus, we can think of this estimator as an statistic computed on the representation space provided by the positive definite kernel h. Now, let us look at the case where \u03ba\u03c3 is the Gaussian kernel; if we construct the Gram matrix K with elements Ki j = \u03ba2\u03c3 (xi,x j), it is easy to verify that the estimator of Renyi\u2019s second-order entropy based on (1) corresponds to:\nH\u03022(X) =\u2212 log ( 1 n2 tr(KK) ) +C(\u03c3). (3)\nwhere C(\u03c3) takes care of the normalization factor of the Parzen window. As we can see, the information potential estimator can be related to the norm of the Gram matrix K defined as \u2016K\u20162 = tr(KK). From the above informal argument two important questions arise. First, it seems natural to ask whether other functionals on Gram matrices allow information theoretic interpretations that can be further utilized as objective functions in ITL. Secondly, even though h was originally derived from a convolution of Parzen windows, was there anything about the implicit representation that allows to interpret (2) in information theoretic terms?"}, {"heading": "2.1 Renyi\u2019s Axioms for Gram matrices", "text": "Real Hermitian matrices are considered generalizations of real numbers. It is possible to define a partial ordering on this set by using positive definite matrices, which are a generalization of the positive real numbers. Let Mn be the set of all n\u00d7 n real matrices; for two Hermitian matrices A,B \u2208 Mn, we say A < B if A\u2212B is positive definite. Likewise, A \u227b B means that A\u2212B is strictly positive definite.\nThe following spectral decomposition theorem [7] relates to the functional calculus on matrices and provides a reasonable way to extend continuous scalar-valued functions to Hermitian matrices.\nTheorem 2.1 Let D \u2282 C be a given set and let Nn(D) := {A \u2208 Mn : A is normal and \u03c3(A) \u2282 D}, where \u03c3(A) denotes the spectrum of A.

The functional will then be applied to Gram matrices constructed by pairwise evaluation of a positive definite kernel on the data samples.\nConsider the set \u2206+n of positive definite matrices A \u2208 Mn for which tr(A)\u2264 1. It is clear that this set is closed under finite convex combinations.\nProposition 2.1 Let A \u2208 \u2206+n and B \u2208 \u2206+n and also tr(A) = tr(B) = 1. The functional\nS\u03b1(A) = 1\n1\u2212\u03b1 log2 [tr(A \u03b1)], (5)\nsatisfies the following set of conditions:\n(i) S\u03b1(PAP\u2217) = S\u03b1(A) for any orthonormal matrix P \u2208 Mn (ii) S\u03b1(pA) is a continuous function for 0 < p \u2264 1.\n(iii) S\u03b1( 1n I) = log2 n.\n(iv) S\u03b1(A\u2297B) = S\u03b1(A)+ S\u03b1(B).\n(v) If AB = BA = 0; then for the strictly monotonic and continuous function g(x) = 2(\u03b1\u22121)x for \u03b1 6= 1 and \u03b1 > 0, we have that:\nS\u03b1(tA+(1\u2212 t)B) = g\u22121 (tg(S\u03b1(A))+ (1\u2212 t)g(S\u03b1(B))) . (6)\nProof 2.1 The proof of (i) easily follows from Theorem 2.1. Take A = U\u039bU\u2217 now PU is also a unitary matrix and thus f (A) = f (PAP\u2217) the trace functional is invariant under unitary transformations. For (ii), the proof reduces to the continuity of 11\u2212\u03b1 log2(p) \u03b1 . For (iii), a simple calculation yields trA\u03b1 = ( 1\nn\n)\u03b1\u22121 . Now, for property (iv), notice that if trA = trB = 1, then, tr(A\u2297B) = 1.\nSince A = U\u039bU\u2217 and B = V\u0393V \u2217 we can write A \u2297 B = (U \u2297V )(\u039b \u2297 \u0393)(U \u2297V )\u2217, from which\ntr(A\u2297B)\u03b1 = tr(\u039b\u2297\u0393)\u03b1 = tr(\u039b\u03b1)tr(\u0393\u03b1) and thus (iv) is proved. Finally, (v) notice that for any integer power k of tA+(1\u2212 t)B we have: (tA+(1\u2212 t)B)k = (tA)k +((1\u2212 t)B)k since AB = BA = 0. Under extra conditions such as f (0) = 0 the argument in the proof of Theorem 2.1 can be extended to this case. Since the eigen-spaces for the non-null eigenvalues of A and B are orthogonal we can simultaneously diagonalize A and B with the orthonormal matrix U, that is A = U\u039bU\u2217 and B = U\u0393U\u2217 where \u039b and \u0393 are diagonal matrices containing the eigenvalues of A and B respectively. Since AB = BA = 0, then \u039b\u0393 = 0. Under the extra condition f (0) = 0, we have that f (tA+(1\u2212 t)B) = f (tA)+ f ((1\u2212 t)B) yielding the desired result for (v).\nNotice also that if the rank of A, \u03c1(A) = 1, the entropy S\u03b1(A) = 0 for any \u03b1 6= 0. It is also true that,\nS\u03b1(A)\u2264 S\u03b1( 1 n I) = log2 n. (7)\nAs we can see (5) satisfies some properties attributed to entropy. Nevertheless, such a characterization may not fully endow all unit-trace positive definite matrices with an information theoretic interpretation. Which descriptors are suitable in representing joint-spaces? What properties should be satisfied by the matrices in order to be applied to concepts that link them to random variables such as conditioning? In what follows, we address these points by developing notions of joint entropy and conditional entropy, for which, additional properties must be fulfilled. Recall that the notions of joint and conditional entropy are not only important for the above reasons, but they also provide the means to propose objective functions for learning that are based on information theoretic quantities."}, {"heading": "2.2 Hadamard Products and the Notion of Joint Entropy", "text": "Positive kernels are also useful in integrating multiple modalities. Using the the product kernel, we can readily define the notion of joint-entropy. Consider a sequence of sample pairs {(xi,yi)}Ni=1 where xi \u2208 X and yi \u2208 Y . Assume, we have a positive definite kernels \u03ba1 defined on X \u00d7X and \u03ba2 defined on X \u00d7X . The product kernel \u03ba((xi,yi),(x j ,y j)) = \u03ba1(xi,x j)\u03ba(yi,y j) is a positive definite kernel on (X \u00d7Y )\u00d7 (X \u00d7Y ). As we can see the Hadamard product arises as a joint representation in a our matrix based entropy. Consider two matrices A and B in \u2206n with unit trace, for which there exists some relation between the elements Ai j and Bi j for all i and j. The joint entropy can be defined as:\nS\u03b1\n(\nA\u25e6B tr(A\u25e6B)\n)\n(8)\nIt is important then to verify that the definition of joint entropy (8) satisfies a basic intuition about uncertainty. The joint entropy should never be smaller than any of the individual entropies of the variables that conform it. The following proposition verifies this intuition for a subset of the unit trace, positive definite matrices.\nProposition 2.2 Let A and B be two n\u00d7 n positive definite matrices with trace 1 with nonnegative entries, and Aii = 1n for i = 1,2, . . . ,n.

In the Shannon\u2019s definition of conditional entropy, H(X |Y ) can be expressed as H(X |Y ) = H(X ,Y )\u2212H(Y ). The properties of this definition has been recently studied in the case of Renyi\u2019s entropies [8] and in the matrix case, this definition yields:\nS\u03b1(A|B) = S\u03b1 ( A\u25e6B tr(A\u25e6B) ) \u2212 S\u03b1(B), (10)\nfor positive semidefinite matrices A and B with nonnegative entries and unit trace, such that Aii = 1n for all i = 1, . . . ,n. The above quantity is nonnegative and upper bounded by S\u03b1(A). Certainly,\nnormalization is an important property of the matrices involved in the above results. If A and B are normalized to have unit trace, then for r \u2208 [0,1] it is true that the Hadamard product of\nA\u25e6r \u25e6B\u25e6(1\u2212r), (11) is also normalized. However, it is not always true that the resulting matrix (11) is positive definite.

To avoid confusion, let us describe the key points to bear in mind before we move to the mathematical description. Infinitely divisible kernels and negative definite functions are tied together trough the exponential a logarithm functions. Both functions provide Hilbert space representations of the data. We can think of the RKHS of the infinitely divisible kernel as a representation to compute the higher order descriptors of the data. On the other hand, the Hilbertian metric can be the representation space for which we want to compute the high order statistics.

Does the above hold if we to take fractional powers of A? In other words,is the matrix A\u25e6 1 m < 0 for any positive integer m? This question leads to the concept of infinitely divisible matrices [10, 11]. A nonnegative matrix A is said to be infinitely divisible if A\u25e6r < 0 for every nonnegative r. Infinitely divisible matrices are intimately related to negative definiteness as we can see from the following proposition\nProposition 3.1 If A is infinitely divisible, then the matrix Bi j =\u2212 logAi j is negative definite\nFrom this fact it is possible to relate infinitely divisible matrices with isometric embeddings into Hilbert spaces.

The conditional entropy can be computed as S\u03b1(L|Y ) = S\u03b1 (nK\u25e6L)\u2212S\u03b1(K), and its gradient at A, which can be derived based on (24), is given by:\nXT(P\u2212 diag(P1))XA (18)\nwhere P = (nL\u25e6\u2207S\u03b1 (nK\u25e6L)\u2212\u2207S\u03b1(K))\u25e6K (19)\nFinally, we can use (18) to search for A iteratively. UCI Data: To evaluate the results we use the same experimental setup proposed in [14], we compares 5 different approaches to supervised metric learning based on the classification error obtained from two-fold cross-validation using a 4-nearest neighbor classifier. The reported errors are averages errors from 10 runs on the two folds for each algorithm; in our case the parameters are p = 3, \u03b1 = 1.01 and \u03c3 = \u221a 3. The feature vectors were centered and scaled to have unit variance. Figure 2(a) shows the results of the proposed approach conditional entropy metric learning (CEML), information theoretic metric learning (ITML) proposed in [14], neighborhood component analysis (NCA) from [15], the maximally collapsing metric learning (MCML) method from [16], the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) method found in [17], and, as a baseline, the the inverse covariance and Euclidean distances. The results for the Soybean dataset are not reported since there is more than one possible data set in the UCI repository under that name. The errors obtained by the metric learning algorithm using the proposed matrix-based entropy framework are consistently among the best performing methods included in the comparison. Choice of order \u03b1: Even though the choice of the entropy order above appears to be arbitrary, there is a motivation in choosing \u03b1 close to 1. The reason is that the higher the entropy order, the more prone the algorithm is to find unimodal solutions. This can be advantageous if prior knowledge or strong assumptions on the class distributions are taken into consideration. In our experiments, we opted for lower entropy order and give the algorithm more flexibility in finding a good solution. To experimentally show this phenomena, we generated a two-dimensional dataset containing points from two classes. In one direction the classes are very well separated but the distribution has multiple modalities. On the orthogonal direction, the classes are not fully separable, but their distributions are unimodal. Figure 3 shows a sample with points drawn from both classes, as we can see projecting the data onto the horizontal axis provides better separability at the cost of a more complex decision boundary. We run our metric learning algorithm 60 times for different values of \u03b1 and recorded the direction of the resulting one-dimensional feature extractor. Table 1 shows the number of times a particular direction was picked by our algorithm for different entropy orders. It can be seen that for larger values of \u03b1 , the algorithm selected the vertical direction more often.\nUMist Faces: We also run the algorithm on the UMist dataset; This data set consists of Grayscale faces (8 bit [0-255]) of 20 different people. The total number of images is 575 and the size of each image is 112x92 pixels for a total of 10304 dimensions. Pixel values were normalized by dividing by 255 and removing the mean. Figure 2(b) shows the images projected into R2. It is remarkable\nhow a linear projection can separate the faces, and it can also be seen from the Gram matrix that it tries to approximate the co-occurrence matrix L."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we presented a data-driven framework for information theoretic learning based on infinitely divisible matrices. We define estimators of entropy-like quantities that can be computed from the Gram matrices obtained by evaluating infinitely divisible kernels on pairs of samples. The proposed quantities do not assume that the density of the data has been estimated, this can be advantageous in many scenarios where even defining a density is not feasible. We discuss some key properties of the proposed quantities and show how they can be applied to define useful analogues to quantities such as conditional entropy. Based on the proposed framework, we introduce a supervised metric learning algorithm with results that are competitive with the state of the art. Nevertheless, we believe that many interesting formulations to learning problems based on the proposed framework are yet to be found. It is also important to highlight that the connection between the RKHS provided by the infinitely divisible kernel, and the Hilbertian metrics associated with the negative definite functions, opens an interesting avenue to investigate formulations of information theoretic learning algorithms on both spaces, and the implications of choosing one or the other."}, {"heading": "A Additional results and proofs", "text": "To prove (9), we need to introduce the concept of majorization and some results pertaining the ordering that arises from this definition. The proposition is replicated in this appendix for the sake of self containment.\nDefinition A.1 (Majorization): Let p and q be two nonnegative vectors in Rn such that \u2211ni=1 pi = \u2211ni=1 qi <\u221e. We say p4 q, q majorizes p, if their respective ordered sequences p[1]\u2265 p[2]\u2265 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 p[n] and q[1] \u2265 q[2] \u2265 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 q[n] denoted by {p[i]}ni=1 and {p[i]}ni=1, satisfy:\nk\n\u2211 i=1\np[i] \u2264 k\n\u2211 i=1 q[i] for k = 1, . . . ,n (20)\nIt can be shown that if p 4 q then p = Aq for some doubly stochastic matrix A [18]. It is also easy to verify that if p 4 q and p 4 h then p 4 tq+(1\u2212 t)h for t \u2208 [0,1]. The majorization order is important because it can be associated with the definition of Schur-concave (convex) functions. A real valued function f on Rn is called Schur-convex if p 4 q implies f (p)\u2264 f (q) and Schur-concave if f (q) \u2264 f (p).\nLemma A.1 The function f\u03b1 : S n 7\u2192 R+ (S n denotes the n dimensional simplex), defined as,\nf\u03b1(p) = 1 1\u2212\u03b1 log2 n \u2211 i=1 p\u03b1i , (21)\nis Schur-concave for \u03b1 > 0.\nNotice that, Schur-concavity (Schur-convexity) cannot be confused with concavity (convexity) of a function in the usual sense. Now, we are ready to state the inequality for Hadamard products.\nProposition A.1 Let A and B be two n\u00d7 n positive definite matrices with trace 1 with nonnegative entries, and Aii = 1n for i = 1,2, . . . ,n. Then, the following inequality holds:\nS\u03b1\n(\nA\u25e6B tr(A\u25e6B)\n)\n\u2265 S\u03b1(B), (22)\nProof A.1 In proving (9), we will use the fact that S\u03b1 preserves the majorization order (inversely) of nonnegative sequences on the n-dimensional simplex. First look at the identity\nxT(A\u25e6B)x = tr(ADxBDx) = 1 n\nIn particular, if {xi}ni=1 is an orthonormal basis for Rn, tr(A\u25e6B) = n \u2211\ni=1 xTi (A\u25e6B)xi. If we let {xi}ni=1\nbe the eigenvectors of A \u25e6B ordered according to their respective eigenvalues in decreasing order, then,\nk\n\u2211 i=1\nxTi (A\u25e6B)xi = k\n\u2211 i=1 tr(ADxiBDxi) \u2264 1 n\nk\n\u2211 i=1 tr ( 11TDxi BDxi )\n= 1 n\nk\n\u2211 i=1 xTi Bxi \u2264 1 n\nk\n\u2211 i=1 yTi Byi, (23)\nwhere k = 1, . . . ,n and {yi}ni=1 are the eigenvectors of B ordered according to their respective eigenvalues in decreasing order. The inequality (23) is equivalent to say that n\u03bb (A\u25e6B)4 \u03bb (B), that is, the sequence of eigenvalues of (A \u25e6B)/tr(A\u25e6B) is majorized by the sequence of eigenvalues of B, which implies (9) by Lemma A.1.\nA beautiful observation from Theorem 3.1 is that, according to equation (10), the proposed normalization procedure for infinitely divisible matrices can be thought of as finding the maximum entropy matrix among all matrices for which the Hilbert space embeddings are isometrically isomorphic.\nA.1 Derivatives of Spectral Functions\nLet Hn denote the vector space of real Hermitian matrices of size n\u00d7 n endowed with inner product \u3008X,Y\u3009= trXY; and let Un denote the set of n\u00d7n unitary matrices. A real valued function f defined on a subset of Hn is unitarily invariant if f (UXU\u2217) = f (X) for any U \u2208 Un. Associated with each spectral function f there is a symmetric function F on Rn. By symmetric we mean that F(x) = F(Px) for any n\u00d7n permutation matrix P. Let \u03bb (X) denote the vector of ordered eigenvalues of X; then, a spectral function f (X) is of the form F(\u03bb (X)) for F a symmetric. We are interested in the differentiation of the composition (F \u25e6\u03bb )(\u00b7) = F(\u03bb (\u00b7)) at X2. The following result [13] allows us to differentiate a spectral function f at X\nTheorem A.1 Let the set \u2126 \u2282 Rn be open and symmetric, that is, for any x \u2208 \u2126 and any n\u00d7 n permutation matrix P, Px \u2208 \u2126. Suppose that F is symmetric, Then, the spectral function F(\u03bb (\u00b7)) is differentiable at a matrix X if and only if F is differentiable at the vector \u03bb (X). In this case, the gradient of F \u25e6\u03bb at X is \u2207(F \u25e6\u03bb )(X) = Udiag(\u2207F(\u03bb (X)))U\u2217, (24) for any unitary matrix satisfying X = Udiag(\u03bb (X))U\u2217.\n2In here, \u25e6 denotes composition rather than Hadamard product"}], "references": [{"title": "Information Theoretic Learning: Renyi\u2019s Entropy and Kernel Perspectives, ser", "author": ["J.C.
