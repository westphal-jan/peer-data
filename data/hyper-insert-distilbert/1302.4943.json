A belief network (also referred to as probabilistic net work or causal network) consists of a qualitative part, encoding a domain's variables and the probabilistic in fluences among them in a directed graph, and a quan titative part, encoding probabilities over these vari ables. Building the qualitative part of a belief network has parallels to other AI approaches and, although it may require significant effort, generally is not consid ered the hardest part in belief network construction. In most cases this task is dominated by the task of acquiring the quantification of the network.\nQuantifying a belief network amounts to assessing\nprobability distributions for each of the network's vari ables conditional on their direct predecessors in the directed graph. In most domains, at least some infor mation is available to this end, be it from literature or from domain experts. However, this information often is not directly amenable to encoding in a belief net work. For example, available information may not be numerical in nature. An expert may be certain of the fact that some values of a statistical variable A make some values of a variable B more likely, and perhaps have an idea of the lower and upper bounds on the numerical strength of this influence, yet may not be able to give exact numbers. Also, available probabil ities may not match the probabilities to be assessed. Medical literature, for example, often reports proba bilities of symptoms given diseases but usually not the probabilities of symptoms given no diseases and not necessarily the specific probabilities required for the intermediate disease states modeled in the network. Moreover, experts may feel more confident providing estimates of conditional probabilities in the diagnostic direction than in the causal direction of probabilistic influence.\nProbabilistic information is available in many different shapes. It ranges from numerical point and interval probabilities, through order of magnitude estimates and signs of influences and synergies, to purely qualita tive statements concerning independence of variables. This range has inspired a variety of schemes for rea soning under uncertainty. Some of these schemes build on quantitative information such as belief networks [Pearl, 1988] and undirected graphical models [Whit taker, 1990]; others build on partial numerical specifi cations, allowing for interval rather than point prob abilities [Breese and Fertig, 1991; Coletti et al., 1991; Coletti, 1994; van der Gaag, 1991] or for order of mag nitude estimates [Goldszmidt and Pearl, 1992]. Yet other schemes are purely qualitative in nature, such as qualitative probabilistic networks [Wellman, 1990]. Also non-probabilistic schemes have been proposed, each addressing a specific type of uncertainty, such as Dempster-Shafer theory [Shafer, 1976], possibility theory [Zadeh, 1978], and non-monotonic logics [Pearl, 1989]. Each of these schemes typically allows for en-\n142 Druzdzel and van der Gaag\ncoding only a few types of information. A unifying principle that would allow combining the various types of information has been lacking so far, making it hard to utilize the variety of information available in prac tice.\nWith the purpose of quantifying belief networks in mind, we propose a method for accommodating both qualitative and quantitative probabilistic information about a yet unknown joint probability distribution Pr over a set of variables V. The basic idea of our method is to consider the distribution hyperspace of all possible joint probability distributions over V. The true, yet unknown distribution Pr is a point in this hyperspace. If no information is available about Pr, then the true distribution can be any point in the distribution hy perspace. Information about Pr, whether qualitative or quantitative, expresses a constraint on the hyper space since certain distributions become incompatible with this information. Probability elicitation can now be looked upon as constraining the distribution hyper space as much as possible. To this end, we express all probabilistic information that is available about the unknown distribution as constraints. Assuming that all joint probability distributions that are compatible with the available information are equally likely, we then derive second-order probability distributions over the probabilities to be assessed. These second-order distributions may be used directly or may be a starting point for further refinement. Note that our approach provides a common denominator for various types of probabilistic information. Also note that by interpret ing the qualitative and quantitative information that a domain expert is willing to state, we effectively pro vide for non-invasive elicitation of probabilities. We believe that our method is a valuable supplement to the classical decision-analytic techniques of probability elicitation.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces a simple belief network that will be used throughout the paper and gives examples of probabilistic information that is typically available for quantifying a network. Section 3 presents a canoni cal form for representing probabilistic information and Section 4 describes interpretation of various types of information within this canonical form. Section 5 demonstrates how information expressed in canonical form can be used to derive second-order probability distributions over probabilities of interest. We finish with a discussion and an outline of directions for fur ther research in Section 6.\n2 AN EXAMPLE\nConsider building a highly simplified belief network modeling causes of HIV virus infection. Our network includes four variables: HIV infection (H) , needle sharing (N), sexual intercourse (I), and use of a con dom (C). We assume, for the sake of simplicity, that these variables are binary; for example H has two out-\ncomes, denoted h and h, representing \"HIV infection present\" and \"HIV infection absent,\" respectively.\nThe first step in building a belief network is to design its structure in terms of probabilistic influences among its variables. Belief networks achieve clarity and large savings in terms of storage of a joint probability dis tribution by explicit representation of the indepen dences holding among its variables. These indepen dences are encoded in a directed acyclic graph, where each node represents a variable and each arc repre sents, informally speaking, a direct probabilistic influ ence between its incident nodes. Absence of an arc be tween two variables means that these variables do not influence each other directly, and hence are (condition ally) independent. For orienting the arcs in the graph, it is generally considered good practice to reflect the causal mechanisms [Druzdzel and Simon, 1993] of the domain. In our example, we may reasonably assume that sharing needles and condom usage are indepen dent. Similarly, whether or not a person shares needles may be assumed independent of whether this person engages in sexual intercourse. One possible graph re flecting our beliefs concerning HIV infection is shown in Figure 1.\nOnce the qualitative part of a network is considered robust, the network is quantified. To this end, for each variable the probabilities of its values conditional on the values of its direct predecessors in the graph have to be assessed. For the graph shown in Fig ure 1, numbers representing Pr(N), Pr(I), Pr(C\\I), and Pr(H\\N IC) are required. Obtaining these num bers is considered to be far more difficult than con figuring the qualitative part of the network, mainly because of difficulties in obtaining statistical data and in eliciting probabilities from domain experts. In our example, there are several sources of information that can help in obtaining the required probabilities. Mor bidity tables may provide Pr(h), a point estimate of the prevalence of HIV in the population of interest. We may get ball-park estimates on frequencies of sex ual intercourse and condom usage in intercourse, that is, Pr(i) and Pr(c\\i). We further know that condoms are used primarily during intercourse, so Pr(i\\c) is close to zero. In addition, various populations of in travenous drug users have been studied with respect to their needle sharing habits. Findings from these studies may help in assessing Pr(n). Also, statistics may be obtained concerning the way of contracting\nElicitation of Probabilities for Belief Networks 143\nHIV from among the infected population, yielding es timates for Pr(nlh) and Pr(ilh), or perhaps even for Pr(iclh) and Pr(iclh). There is also semi-numerical information available. For example, the probability of contracting HIV by needle sharing is higher than the probability of contracting it in sexual intercourse, that is, Pr(hln) > Pr(hli). Also, the relatively small number of intravenous drug users compared to the size of the sexually active population suggests that Pr(i) > Pr(n).\nBesides (semi-)numerical information, we have a body of qualitative information on the subject. We are quite certain that both sharing a needle and a sex ual intercourse with an HIV carrier make infection more likely. We know that using a condom during an intercourse decreases the likelihood of contracting HIV. These two pieces of information express quali tative influences between pairs of variables. A for mal interpretation of qualitative influences has been proposed by [Wellman, 1990] in terms of statistical dominance. This property is also useful in captur ing qualitative synergies between variables. A posi tive (negative) additive synergy [Wellman, 1990] cap tures the property that the joint influence of two variables on a third variable is larger (smaller) than the sum of their individual influences. In our exam ple, condom usage and sexual intercourse are nega tively additively synergistic: using a condom dimin ishes the influence of having intercourse on contracting HIV. Product synergy [Druzdzel and Henrion, 1993; Henrion and Druzdzel, 1991; Wellman and Henrion, 1993], on the other hand, captures intercausal interac tion. An example is the negative intercausal interac tion known as \"explaining away\" [Pearl, 1988] which models negative influence of the presence of one cause on the likelihood of another cause being present given an observed common effect. In our example, needle sharing and sexual intercourse are negatively product synergistic: given HIV infection, factual knowledge about needle sharing reduces the likelihood of inter course being the cause of the infection.\nThese examples demonstrate that practical domains offer a wealth of probabilistic information which, al though not always in the shape of numbers that are directly amenable to encoding in a belief network, may facilitate assessing the required probabilities.\n3 CANONICAL FORM\nOur canonical form for interpreting probabilistic infor mation builds on the property that any joint probabil ity distribution on a set of variables V is uniquely de fined by the probabilities of all possible combinations of values for all variables from V. If these probabilities are known, then any (other) probability from the dis tribution can be computed from them by applying the basic rules of marginalization and conditioning from probability theory. We will call combinations of values for all variables constituent assignments. The proba-\nbilities of constituent assignments in a joint probability distribution will be called its constituent probabilities. The set of all possible joint probability distributions on V now can be looked upon as spanning a hyper space whose dimensions correspond with constituent probabilities.\nAny information about the true, yet unknown prob ability distribution Pr can now be represented as a system of (in)equalities involving this distribution's constituent probabilities as unknowns. Any solution to this system of (in)equalities is a joint probability distribution that is compatible with the available in formation. If the system has a unique solution, then the information provided suffices for uniquely defin ing Pr [van der Gaag, 1991]. Note that in case the system does not have any solution at all, the infor mation about the unknown distribution Pr is inconsis tent. This view of probability is largely based on the early work by Boole [Boole, 1958] on the foundations of probability theory.\nWe introduce some notational conventions. We take V = {V1, . . . , Vn}, n \ufffd 1, to be a set of variables, where each variable Vi can take one of ki values. We will use Vii to denote Vi taking the j-th value from its domain, j = 1, ... , ki. Note that the set of all con stituent assignments for V comprises k = Tii=l, ... ,n ki elements.\nNow, consider an assignment b for an arbitrary subset of variables from V and its unknown probability Pr(b). The assignment b can be written as a disjunction of constituent assignments Ci using basic logical laws. In fact, here exists a unique set of indices Ib \ufffd {1, .. . , k}, called the index set for b, such that b = viEh Ci\u00b7 Since all constituent assignments are mutually exclusive, the probability Pr(b) can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities of the constituent assignments b is built from. So, from Pr(b) = L:iElb Pr(ci) we find that Pr(b) can be expressed as\n(1)\nwhere Xi = Pr(ci), i = 1, ... , k, and di = 1 if i E h and di = 0 otherwise.\nExample: Consider the example belief network for HIV infections from Section 2. There are sixteen con stituent assignments for the variables involved; an or dered list of these assignments is shown in Table 1. Now consider the assignment expressing a person's having sexual intercourse without using a condom, that is, the assignment fc. This assignment can be written as\nic = hnic v hnzc v hn%7: v hnic = C5 V Cg V C10 V C13\nNote that the index set he equals he = {5, 8, 10, 13}. The probability Pr( t7:) can now be expressed as\nPr(ic) = Pr(c5) + Pr(cs) + Pr(cw) + Pr(c13) x5 + Xs + xw + X13\n144 Druzdzel and van der Gaag\nc1 = hnic cs = hnic eg = hnic c2 = hnic cs = hnic c10 = hntc c3 = hnic c1 = hnic cu = hn\ufffdc c4 = hnic cs = hnic c12 = hnic c13 = hnic c14 = hn'lc cl5 = hntc c16 = hn'lc\nTable 1: Constituent assignments for the HIV belief network.\nNote that in terms of expression (1), we have that d5 = ds = d10 = d13 = 1 and di = 0 for all if. 5,8, 10, 13. D\nPosterior probabilities are expressed in canonical form in a similar way. Consider a posterior probability Pr(b1lbz) where b\ufffd, b2 denote assignments for sets of variables. From Pr(b1lbz) = P;\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd:)), we have that Pr(bdbz) can be expressed as\nd1,1X1 + d2,1X2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + dk,lXk d1,2X1 + dz,2X2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + dk,2Xk\nwhere Xi = Pr( ci), and di,l = 1 if i E h1 b2 and di,l = 0 otherwise, and di,2 = 1 if i E Ib2 and di,2 = 0 other wise. Note that di,2 = 1 whenever di,l = 1.\n4 IN TERPRE TATION OF\nPROBABILISTIC INFORMATION\nIn this section, we address expressing axiomatic infor mation, point estimates, probability intervals, compar isons, qualitative influences, and additive synergies in our canonical form. We have designed similar expres sions for other types of information, such as indepen dences, order of magnitude estimates, product syner gies, and noisy-OR gates. A technical report providing all interpretations is in preparation.\n4.1 AXIOMATIC INFORMATION\nEven if no specific information is available about an unknown joint probability distribution, there still is probabilistic information that holds for any distribu tion. This information concerns the basic axiomatic properties of a joint probability distribution.\nThe unknown joint probability distribution Pr is known to be normed, that is, Pr( true) = 1. This prop erty is expressed in canonical form by the equality\nX1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + Xk = 1 (2) where Xi = Pr(ci), i = 1, . . . , k.\nAlso, the probability Pr(b) for any assignment b of a set of variables from V is known to be a non-negative real number. More in specific, we have that for any constituent probability Pr(Ci), i = 1, . . . , k, the prop erty Pr(ci) 2: 0 holds. This information is expressed in canonical form in k inequalities of the form\nXi 2: 0 (3)\nfor i = 1, . . . , k. Note that if all constituent proba bilities are non-negative, then all other probabilities are non-negative as well. Hence, there is no need to specify any additional constraints for this information. Also, note that the constraints (2) and (3) imply that Pr(b) :::;; 1 for any assignment b.\n4.2 POINT PROB ABILITIES, INTERVALS, A ND COMPARISONS\nA point estimate for a prior probability is a statement of the form Pr(b) = p, 0 :::;; p :::;; 1, where b is an assignment for an arbitrary subset of variables. Let h be the index set for b. Then, the point estimate is expressed in canonical form as\nd1x1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + dkxk = p\nwhere Xi= Pr(ci), i = 1, ... , k, and di = 1 if i E h and di = 0 otherwise.\nExample: Consider once more the HIV belief net work. The prevalence of HIV infection in the U.S. pop ulation is Pr(h) = 0.005 according to morbidity tables. This information is expressed in canonical form as\nXI + X3 + X4 + X5 + Xg + X10 + Xll + XI5 = 0.005 D\nA point estimate for a posterior probability is a state ment of the form Pr(b1lb2) = p, 0 :::;; p :::;; 1, where b1, b2 denote assignments for sets of variables. From Pr(b1lbz) = P;\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd:)), we have that Pr(b1b2) = p\u00b7Pr(b2), and therefore Pr(b1 b2) - p \u00b7 Pr(b2) = 0. The probabil ities Pr(b1 b2) and Pr(b2) now are expressed in terms of constituent probabilities as before. The point esti mate for Pr(bdb2) further indicates that Pr(b2) > 0 and, therefore, gives rise to yet another inequality in terms of constituent probabilities.\nSimilar expressions in canonical form are found for probability intervals and comparisons of probabilities. A probability interval is a statement expressing an up per and a lower bound on a prior or posterior prob ability. Such a statement may be of the form PI :::;; Pr(b) :::;; p2 where b is an assignment for an arbitrary subset of variables and PI, P2 are real numbers such that 0 :::;; PI < P2 :::;; 1. A comparison between two prior probabilities can be of the form a I \u00b7 Pr(bi) :::;; a2 \u00b7 Pr(b2) where bi, b2 are assignments for subsets of variables from V and a1, a2 are (non-negative) real numbers. These statements are expressed in canonical form by writing the probabilities Pr(b), Pr(bi), and Pr(b2) in terms of constituent probabilities.\n4.3 QU ALITATIVE INFLUENCES\nA qualitative influence is a symmetric property de scribing the sign of probabilistic interaction between two variables VI and V0, and builds on an ordering of these variables' values. A positive qualitative influence\nElicitation of Probabilities for Belief Networks 145\nfrom vl to Vo expresses that choosing a higher value for V1 makes higher values of V0 more likely, regard less of the values of other variables. More formally [Wellman, 1990], we say that the variable Vi positively influences the variable Vo, denoted by s+(VJ, Vo), iff for all values v0, of V0, for all pairs of distinct values v1; > v1; of Vi, and for all possible assignments b for the set of V0 's direct predecessors other than V1, we have\nPr(Vo \ufffd Vomivl;b) \ufffd Pr(Vo \ufffd VomiVJ;b)\nNegative qualitative influence and zero qualitative in fluence are defined analogously.\nThe statement s+ (V1 , V0) is expressed in canonical form by expressing a set of inequalities in this form. There is one inequality for each combination of one value v0\"' of Vo, one pair of values VJ;, v1; of V1, and one assignment b of Vo 's other predecessors than Vi; this inequality expresses that\nko ko L Pr(vo, ivi ;b) > L Pr(vo,iVI;b) l=m l=m\nNote that there are ( \ufffd ) \u00b7 (ko -1) \u00b7 K such inequali ties, where K is the number of possible assignments for the set of direct predecessors of Vo other than Vi. As these inequalities involve posterior probabilities, each of them gives rise to two additional inequalities.\nExample: For quantifying our HIV belief network, the available information indicates that needle sharing positively influences HIV infection, that is, s+(N, H). This statement translates into the four inequalities:\nPr(hinic) > Pr(hlnic)\nPr(hinic) > Pr(hinic) Pr(hlnic) > Pr(hln\ufffdc)\nPr(hlrizc) > Pr(hin\"ic)\nand eight additional inequalities expressing that Pr(nic) > 0, ... , Pr(nzc) > 0. Note that the statement s+ (N, H) gives rise to the total of twelve inequalities. The first inequality mentioned above is expressed in canonical form as\nX2X3- XJX6 \ufffd 0\nThe other inequalities are expressed analogously. 0\n4.4 QUALITATIVE SYNERGIES\nAn additive synergy pertains to the joint influence of two variables vl and v2 on a third variable Vo, and, similarly to qualitative influence, builds on an ordering of these variables' values. A positive additive synergy of VI and v2 with respect to Vo expresses that the joint influence of vl and v2 is greater than the sum of their individual influences. More formally [Wellman,\n1990], we say that the variables Vi and V2 exhibit pos itive additive synergy with respect to Vo, denoted by Y+({V1, V2}, Vo), iff for all values v0\"' of Vo, for all Pairs of values VJ. > VJ . of V1 and V2 .1 > V2 .1 of V2, ' 3 ' J and for all possible assignments b for the set of V0 's direct predecessors not including vl and v2, we have\nPr(Vo 2: VomiVJ;V2;,b) +Pr(Vo \ufffd Vo,iVJ;V2;,b) 2: Pr(Vo 2: Vo,iVJ;V2;,b) +Pr(Vo \ufffd Vomiv1;V2;,b)\nNegative additive synergy and zero additive synergy are defined analogously.\nThe statement y+ ({ V1 , V2}, V0) is expressed in canon ical form by a set of inequalities in the above form. There is one inequality for each combination of one value v0\"' of V0, one pair of values v1;, VI; of VI , one pair of values v2.,, v2 ., of V2, and one assignment b of . ' V0 's other direct predecessors than Vi and V2; there are ( k2 ) \u00b7 ( k\ufffd ) \u00b7 (ko -1) \u00b7 K such inequalities, where K is the number of possible assignments for the set of direct predecessors of Vo other than V1 and V2. As these inequalities involve posterior probabilities, each of them gives rise to additional inequalities as outlined before.\nExample: Consider once more our HIV belief net work under construction. The available information indicates that there is a negative additive synergy be tween sexual intercourse and using a condom with re spect to HIV infection, that is, that y-({J,C},H). This statement translates into the two inequalities:\nPr(h lnic) + Pr(hln\"ic) < Pr(hlmc) + Pr(hinic)"}, {"heading": "Pr(hinic) + Pr(hin\"ic) < Pr(hin\ufffdc) + Pr(hinzc)", "text": "and eight additional inequalities expressing that Pr(nic) > 0, ... , Pr(nzc) > 0. Note that the statement y-( {I, C}, N) gives rise to the total of ten inequali ties. The first inequality above leads to\n-x1X4X5X14 - X2X4X5Xll - 2X2X4X5X14\n+X1X5X7Xu - X2X5X7X14 + XIX4XsXu\n-x2X4XsX14 + 2XJX7XsXu + X1X7XsXI4\n+x2x1xsxu < 0\nThe other inequalities are expressed in canonical form analogously. 0\nProduct synergy pertains to the interaction between two variables vl and v2 conditional on their common descendant V0 and expresses the sign of what is known as intercausal influence between Vi and V2. The most common type of product synergy is the negative prod uct synergy, capturing the notion of \"explaining away.\" We say that the variables V1 and V2 exhibit negative product synergy with respect to a particular value v0,. of variable Vo, written x-({V\ufffd, V2},v0,.), if for all pairs of values V2; > V2; of V2 and for all possible\n146 Druzdzel and van der Gaag\nassignments b for the set of V0 's direct predecessors not including VI and v2, we have\nPr(Vi \ufffd vi,Iv2,vo=b) :S Pr(Vi \ufffd vi,Iv2;vo=b)\nPositive product synergy and zero product synergy are defined analogously. Note that, in contrast to addi tive synergy, product synergy is defined with respect to separate values of the common effect V0\u2022 There are, therefore, as many product synergies as there are val ues of Vo. A statement X- ({VI' v2}' Vo=) is expressed in canonical form much in the same way as qualitative influences and additive synergies.\nIt is worth noting that the above definition is con siderably less complex than the definition proposed in [Druzdzel and Henrion, 1993]. The latter definition expresses product synergy in terms of the probability of Vo conditional on VI and v2 to allow for derivation of the sign of product synergy from an existing condi tional distribution encoded in a network. In terms of the canonical form proposed in this paper, we can af ford defining product synergy in terms of probability of VI conditional on v2 and Vo. This does not have any effect on the interpretation of statements regard ing product synergy yet simplifies the matters greatly.\n5 ELICITATION OF PROBABILITIES\nOur method for elicitation of probabilities from a do main expert amounts to reasoning about the informa tion that is available about the unknown joint proba bility distribution. We have illustrated how various types of information are expressed in the canonical form as a system of (in)equalities with constituent probabilities as unknowns. This section shows how these (in)equalities can be used to derive second-order probability distributions over any probability of inter est in the sense suggested by [Pearl, 1988].\n5.1 DERIVATION OF SECOND-ORDER DISTRIBUTIONS\nFrom the system of (in)equalities resulting from expression of available probabilistic information in canonical form, we can compute upper and lower bounds on any probability of interest. The length of a computed interval then indicates the uncertainty in the probability's value and hence is a measure for the incompleteness of the available information. This method has been proposed before by Van der Gaag in view of systems of linear (in)equalities [van der Gaag, 1991]. For probability elicitation, this method has the disadvantage that upper and lower bounds on a prob ability give insufficient insight into how likely a value from the interval is to be the actual probability. Nor do these bounds provide an estimate of the expected value of the probability. We would like to note that for decision making in presence of uncertainty about a probability p, knowing the expected value of p suffices,\neven if the distribution over p is unknown [Howard, 1988].\nTo yield insight in the likelihood of values for the true probability, and in particular to be able to de rive its expected value, we propose using sampling to find second-order distributions for the probabilities to be assessed. For computing these second-order distri butions, we randomly select points from the distribu tion hyperspace, assuming that all points in the hy perspace are equally likely to be the true distribution. For each selected distribution, we verify its compati bility with all available information, that is, we verify if it is a solution to the system of (in)equalities de rived from this information. All selected distributions matching the available information are collected and scored for the probabilities to be assessed; the result is a second-order distribution over each such proba bility. We would like to note that computing second order distributions is computationally expensive as it involves generating and investigating joint probability distributions described by their constituent probabili ties and the number of these constituent probabilities is exponential in the number of variables discerned.\nExample: Consider once again the HIV infection ex ample belief network. We have expressed the following probabilistic information about the four variables H, N, I, and C in canonical form: Pr(ijc) = 1, Pr(i) > Pr(n), Pr(hjn) > Pr(hji), and the information that between 10% and 25% of HIV-infectious are caused by needle sharing, that is, 0.1 :S Pr(njh) :S 0.25. From this information, we derived second-order distri butions for the various probabilities to be assessed for the network by selecting 10,000 matching joint prob ability distributions. The histograms of the samples obtained for Pr( i) and Pr(hjn'i\"c) are shown in Fig ure 2. When normalized, these histograms express a second order probability distribution over Pr( i) and Pr(hjnic). Note that the information from which we derived these distributions did not pertain directly to these probabilities. Another point that we would like to emphasize here is that knowledge of intervals would be useless as the probability Pr(hjn'i\"c), for example, spans over the entire interval between 0 and 1. D\nWe have implemented our method for computing second-order distributions in Allegro Common Lisp on a Hewlett Packard workstation. Our implementation is just a prototype and has been created to serve illus trative purposes. As the implementation is straight forward, it is rather slow and therefore leaves much room for algorithmic improvement.\nEspecially when very restrictive information about the joint probability distribution is available, randomly selecting distributions from the hyperspace tends to yield a huge number of samples that are not compat ible with the available information and therefore are not useful. To improve on the ratio of useful samples, we envision a pre-processing step prior to the selec-\nElicitation of Probabilities for Belief Networks 147\n1000 .----.-------,.-------,r-----,-----,\n800\n600\n800\n600\n400\nFigure 2: Histograms of the samples for Pr(i) (upper) and Pr(hln'i\"c) (lower).\ntion of distributions. In this step, a part of the hy perspace in which the true joint probability distribu tion definitely lies is identified. To this end, all linear (in)equalities from the system at hand are collected and a standard linear-programming technique is ap plied to compute upper and lower bounds on all con stituent probabilities. The thus computed bounds are guaranteed to be sound: no point in the hyperspace outside these bounds can represent the unknown prob ability distribution. These bounds, however, may not be tight as there may be other, yet unconsidered in formation. Selecting distributions is now performed within the bounds yielded by the pre-processing step.\n5.2 FOCUSING ELICITATION\nReasoning about probabilistic information is compu tationally expensive. This is not surprising given that inference in belief networks is NP-hard [Cooper, 1990]. To allow for sidestepping the issue of complexity, we divide the problem of reasoning about qualitative and quantitative probabilistic information over all statis tical variables in the network under construction into smaller subproblems and address these separately.\nDivision into subproblems is achieved by transforming the directed graph of the network into an undirected chordal graph that equally models independences from the distribution at hand. A chordal graph has the use ful property that the joint probability distribution over the represented variables factorizes into marginal dis-\ntributions on the separate cliques of this graph. This property allows for addressing the problem of elicita tion of probabilities per clique. For transforming . .the directed graph of a belief network into a chordal graph, we make use of the transformation scheme designed by [Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988].\nComputational complexity, however, is just one of the reasons for focusing elicitation of probabilities on small sets of variables. Focusing is also suggested by knowl edge acquisition experience both in decision analysis and in expert systems design: human experts typi cally express information about short causal reasoning chains and feel uncomfortable when forced to provide more global information. An important property of the applied transformation is that, as for any variable and its direct predecessors a clique is yielded, causal mechanisms are never split up over different cliques and hence are never broken. We believe that the ob tained cliques form small entities suitable for elicita tion.\n6 DISCUSSION\nAlthough the usefulness of belief networks for repre senting and reasoning under uncertainty is widely ac cepted, eliciting probabilities for quantifying a network is often perceived a problem. It often turns out, how ever, that it is the need to express probabilistic infor mation as exact numbers that tends to make domain experts feel uncomfortable: experts typically are able to state probabilistic information of a semi-numerical or qualitative nature with conviction and clarity, and hence with little cognitive effort. In this paper, we have proposed a method that allows for non-invasive elicitation of probabilities by interpreting and com bining whatever an expert is willing to state. Our method can be used iteratively in the sense of start ing the elicitation with only most robust and read ily available information, and then narrowing down the focus of elicitation successively. As elicitation of probabilities from domain experts generally is a time consuming and costly task, we expect this approach to lead to considerable savings. We believe that our method provides a valuable supplement to decision analytic methods of probability elicitation.\nEven though a non-invasive method of collecting in formation from experts may be less prone to conflicts than a method eliciting numerical probabilities, the constraints elicited may turn out to be inconsistent. Inconsistencies can arise from an expert's internal in consistency or from disagreement among multiple ex perts and can occur either within a clique or between cliques. Detection of inconsitencies is quite straightfor ward. In accord with the decision analytic approach, we view inconsistencies as an additional opportunity to refine the elicitation by confronting the expert with conflicting statements. We believe that including both qualitative and quantitative statements in elicitation aids this refinement: qualitative information gener-\n148 Druzdzel and van der Gaag\nally is more robust and cognitively reliable. We plan to deal with inconsistencies by prioritizing the expert statements according to their expected robustness and suggesting the least robust constraints for revision. In the near future, we envision making our method the centerpiece of a general purpose computerized proba bility elicitation tool.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank one of the reviewers for references to the work of Coletti et al.\nReferences\n[Boole, 1958] George Boole.
