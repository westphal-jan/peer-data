Often, however, an appli\u00ad cation will not need information about ev\u00ad ery node in the network nor will it need ex\u00ad act probabilities. We present the localized partial evaluation (LPE) propagation algo\u00ad rithm, which computes interval bounds on the marginal probability of a specifted query node by examining a subset of the nodes in the entire network. Conceptually, LPE ig\u00ad nores parts of the network that are \"too far away\" from the queried node to have much impact on its value. LPE has the \"anytime\" property of being able to produce better so\u00ad lutions (tighter intervals) given more time to consider more of the network.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
