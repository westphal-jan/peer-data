In order to successfully man\u00ad age intelligent systems for decision making, however, we must be able to predict the ef\u00ad fects of actions. In this paper, we attempt to unite two branches of research that address such predictions: causal modeling and deci\u00ad sion analysis. First, we provide a definition of causal dependence in decision-analytic terms, which we derive from consequences of causal dependence cited in the literature. Using this definition , we show how causal depen\u00ad dence can be represented within an influence diagram. In particular, we identify two in\u00ad adequacies of an ordinary influence diagram as a representation for cause. We introduce a special class of influence diagrams, called causal influence diagrams, which corrects one of these problems, and identify situations where the other inadequacy can be elimi\u00ad nated. In addition, we describe the relation\u00ad ships between Howard Canonical Form and existing graphical representations of cause.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
