Guelev Institute of Mathematics and Informatics\nBulgarian Academy of Sciences Sofia, Bulgaria\ngelevdp@math.bas.bg\nWe propose a validity preserving translation from a subset of epistemic Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) to epistemic Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The considered subset of epistemic ATL is known to have the finite model property and decidable model-checking. This entails the decidability of validity but the implied algorithm is unfeasible. Reducing the validity problem to that in a corresponding system of CTL makes the techniques for automated deduction for that logic available for the handling of the apparently more complex system of ATL."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The strategic cooperation modalities of alternating time temporal logic (ATL, [AHK97, AHK02]) generalize the path quantifier \u2200 of computation tree logic (CTL). Combinations of ATL with modal logics of knowledge [vdHW03, JvdH04] extend temporal logics of knowledge (cf. e.g [FHMV95]) in the way ATL extends CTL. Automated deduction for CTL and linear time epistemic temporal logics has been studied extensively [FDP01, BDF99, GS09a, GS09b]. There is much less work on the topic for ATL, and hardly any for its epistemic extensions. The decidability of validity in ATL with complete information was established in [GvD06] as a consequence of the finite model property, where the completeness of a Hilbert-style proof system was given too. Hilbert-style proof systems are known to be unsuitable for automating proof search. The situation was remedied by a tableau-based decision procedure developed in [GS09c]. Along with that, the same authors developed tableau systems for branching epistemic temporal logics in [GS09b]. Temporal resolution (cf. e.g. [FDP01]), which is well understood for linear time logics and their epistemic extensions, was considered for ATL in [Zha10], but only for the \u3008\u3008.\u3009\u3009\u25e6-subset, which is similar to coalition logic [Pau02] and enables only reasoning about a fixed number of steps. To our knowledge, no similar work has been done for systems epistemic ATL.\nIn this paper we continue the study [GDE11] of a system of ATL with the operator of distributed knowledge under the perfect recall assumption. In [GDE11] we established the finite model property for a subset, and a model-checking algorithm for the whole system. That algorithm assumed that coalition members can use the distributed knowledge of their coalitions to guide their actions. Dropping that assumption is known to render model-checking undecidable [DT11]. As expected, the validity-checking algorithm which these results imply is unfeasible.\nIn this paper we propose a validity preserving translation from another subset of that logic into epistemic CTL, with distributed knowledge and perfect recall again. As it becomes clear below, the need to consider a subset appears to be due to the lack of connectives in epistemic CTL to capture some interactions between knowledge and the progress of time. The translation makes no assumption on coordination within coalitions and there is no dependence on the availability of the past temporal modalities which\nare featured in the axiomatization from [GDE11]. A semantic assumption that we keep is finite branching: only finitely many states should be reachable in one step from any state and models should have only finitely many initial states. Dropping that assumption would disable the fixpoint characterization of (.U.)-objectives that we exploit, because of the requirement on strategies to be uniform. The translation enables the use of the known techniques for mechanized proof in the apparently simpler logic CTL and its epistemic extensions [BF99, GS09b]. Building on our previous work [GDE11], we work with the semantics of ATL on interpreted systems in their form adopted in [LR06]."}, {"heading": "1 Preliminaries", "text": "1.1 Propositional epistemic ATL with perfect recall (ATLDiR)\nThe syntax of ATLDiR formulas can be given by the BNF \u03d5 ,\u03c8 ::= \u22a5 | p | (\u03d5 \u21d2 \u03c8) | D\u0393\u03d5 | \u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009 \u25e6\u03d5 | \u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009(\u03d5U\u03c8) | [[\u0393]](\u03d5U\u03c8) Here \u0393 ranges over finite sets of agents, and p ranges over propositional variables. In this paper we exclude the past temporal operators as their presence does not affect the working of our translation.\nAn interpreted system is defined with respect to some given finite set \u03a3 = {1, . . . ,N} of agents, and a set of propositional variables (atomic propositions) AP. There is also an environment e 6\u2208 \u03a3; in the sequel we write \u03a3e for \u03a3\u222a{e}.\nDefinition 1 (interpreted systems) An interpreted system for \u03a3 and AP is a tuple of the form \u3008\u3008Li : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009, I,\u3008Acti : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009, t,V \u3009 (1)\nwhere: Li, i \u2208 \u03a3e, are nonempty sets of local states; L\u0393 stands for \u220f\ni\u2208\u0393 Li, \u0393 \u2286 \u03a3e;\nelements of L\u03a3e are called global states; I \u2286 L\u03a3e is a nonempty set of initial global states; Acti, i \u2208 \u03a3e, are nonempty sets of actions; Act\u0393 stands for \u220f\ni\u2208\u0393 Acti;\nt : L\u03a3e \u00d7Act\u03a3e \u2192 L\u03a3e is a transition function; V \u2286 L\u03a3e \u00d7AP is a valuation of the atomic propositions.\nFor every i \u2208 \u03a3e and l\u2032, l\u2032\u2032 \u2208 L\u03a3e such that l\u2032i = l\u2032\u2032i and l\u2032e = l\u2032\u2032e the function t satisfies (t(l\u2032,a))i = (t(l\u2032\u2032,a))i.\nIn the literature an interpreted system also includes a protocol to specify the actions which are permitted at every particular state. Protocols are not essential to our study here as the effect of a prohibited action can be set to that of some fixed permitted action (which is always supposed to exist) to produce an equivalent system in which all actions are always permitted. Our variant of interpreted systems is borrowed from [LR06] and has a technically convenient feature which is not present in other works [FHMV95, LQR]: every agent\u2019s next local state can be directlty affected by the local state of the environment through the transition function. Here follow the technical notions that are relevant to satisfaction of ATL formulas on interpreted systems.\nDefinition 2 (global runs and local runs) Given an n \u2264 \u03c9 , a run of length n is a sequence r = l0a0l10a1 . . . \u2208 L\u03a3e(Act\u03a3e L\u03a3e) n such that l0 \u2208 I and l j+1 = t(l j,a j) for all j < n. A run is infinite, if n = \u03c9 ; otherwise it is finite. In either case we write |r| for the length n of r. (Note that a run of length n < \u03c9 is indeed a sequence of 2n+ 1 states and actions.)\nGiven r as above and \u0393 \u2286 \u03a3, we write r\u0393 for the corresponding local run\nl0\u0393a 0 \u0393 . . .a n\u22121 \u0393 l n \u0393 \u2208 L\u0393(Act\u0393L\u0393) n\nof \u0393 in which l j\u0393 = \u3008l j i : i \u2208 \u0393\u3009 and a j \u0393 = \u3008a j i : i \u2208 \u0393\u3009.\nWe denote the set of all runs of some fixed length n \u2264 \u03c9 , the set of all finite runs, and the set of all runs in IS by Rn(IS), Rfin(IS) and R(IS), respectively.\nGiven i, j < \u03c9 and an r as above such that i \u2264 j \u2264 |r|, we write r[i.. j] for liai . . .a j\u22121l j.\nDefinition 3 (indiscernibility) Given r\u2032,r\u2032\u2032 \u2208 R(IS) and i \u2264 |r\u2032|, |r\u2032\u2032|, we write r\u2032 \u223c\u0393,i r\u2032\u2032 if r\u2032[0..i]\u0393 = r\u2032\u2032[0..i]\u0393. We write r\u2032 \u223c\u0393 r\u2032\u2032 for the conjunction of r\u2032 \u223c\u0393,|r\u2032| r \u2032\u2032 and |r\u2032|= |r\u2032\u2032|.\nSequences of the form r /0 consist of \u3008\u3009s, and, consequently, [r] /0 is the class of all the runs of length |r|. Obviously \u223c\u0393,n and \u223c\u0393 are equivalence relations on R(IS).\nDefinition 4 We denote {r\u2032 \u2208 R(IS) : r\u2032 \u223c\u0393 r} by [r]\u0393.\nDefinition 5 (coalition strategies) A strategy for \u0393 \u2286 \u03a3 is a vector s = \u3008si : i \u2208 \u0393\u3009 of functions si of type {ri : r \u2208 Rfin(IS)} \u2192 Acti. We write S(\u0393, IS) for the set of all the strategies for \u0393 in the considered interpreted system IS. Given s \u2208 S(\u0393, IS) and r \u2208 Rfin(IS), we write out(r,s) for the set\n{r\u2032 = l0a0 . . .an\u22121ln . . . \u2208 R\u03c9(IS) : r\u2032[0..|r|] = r,a ji = si(r[0.. j]\u0393) for all i \u2208 \u0393 and j \u2265 |r|}.\nof the outcomes of r when \u0393 sticks to s from step |r| on. Given an X \u2286 Rfin(IS), out(X ,s) is \u22c3\nr\u2208X out(r,s).\nStrategies, as defined above, are determined by the local views of the considered coalition members and are therefore uniform.\nDefinition 6 (modelling relation of ATLDiR) The relation IS,r |= \u03d5 is defined for r \u2208 Rfin(IS) and formulas \u03d5 by the clauses:\nIS,r 6|=\u22a5; IS, l0a0 . . .an\u22121ln |= p iff V (ln, p) for atomic propositions p; IS,r |= \u03d5 \u21d2 \u03c8 iff either IS,r 6|= \u03d5 or IS,r |= \u03c8 ; IS,r |= D\u0393\u03d5 iff IS,r\u2032 |= \u03d5 for all r\u2032 \u2208 [r]\u0393; IS,r |= \u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009 \u25e6\u03d5 iff there exists an s \u2208 S(\u0393, IS) such that IS,r\u2032[0..|r|+1] |= \u03d5 for all r\u2032 \u2208 out([r]\u0393,s); IS,r |= \u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009(\u03d5U\u03c8) iff there exists an s \u2208 S(\u0393, IS) s. t. for every r\u2032 \u2208 out([r]\u0393,s) there exists a k < \u03c9 s. t.

Validity of formulas in entire interpreted systems and on the class of all interpreted systems, that is, in the logic ATLDiR, is defined as satisfaction at all 0-length runs in the considered interpreted system, and at all the 0-length runs in all the systems in the considered class, respectively.\nIn this paper we assume that each coalition member uses only its own observation power in following a coalition strategy. Allowing coalition members to share their observations gives rise to a more general form of strategy, which are functions of type {r\u0393 : r \u2208 Rfin(IS)} \u2192 Act\u0393, and which was assumed by the model-checkig algorithm proposed in [GDE11]."}, {"heading": "Abbreviations", "text": "\u22a4, \u00ac, \u2228, \u2227 and \u21d4 have their usual meanings.

Let IS stand for some arbitrary interpreted system (1) with finite branching, with \u03a3 = {1, . . . ,N} as its set of agents, AP as its vocabulary. We adapt the following simple observation, which works in case Acti, i \u2208 \u03a3 are fixed. Readers who are familiar with the original semantics of ATL on alternating transition systems (ATS) from [AHK97] will recognize the similarity of our technique with the transformation of concurrent game structures into equivalent ATS from [GJ04]. Assuming that Acti, i \u2208 \u03a3e, are pairwise disjoint, and disjoint with AP, we consider the vocabulary APAct = AP\u222a \u22c3\ni\u2208\u03a3e Acti.\nDefinition 8 Given IS and \u2217 6\u2208 \u22c3\ni\u2208\u03a3e Acti, we define the interpreted system\nISAct = \u3008\u3008LActi : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009, I Act,\u3008Acti : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009, tAct,V Act\u3009\nby putting:\nLActi = Li \u00d7 (Acti \u222a{\u2217}), i \u2208 \u03a3e; IAct = {\u3008\u3008li,\u2217\u3009 : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009 : l \u2208 I}; tAct(\u3008\u3008li,ai\u3009 : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009,b) = \u3008\u3008(t(l,b))i,bi\u3009 : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009; V Act(\u3008\u3008li,ai\u3009 : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009, p) \u2194 V (\u3008li, : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009, p) for p \u2208 AP; V Act(\u3008\u3008li,ai\u3009 : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009,b) \u2194 b = a j for b \u2208 Act j, j \u2208 \u03a3e.\nIn short, an ISAct state is an IS state augmented with a record of the actions which lead to it, the dummy symbol \u2217 being used in initial states. Let R \u2286 LAct\u03a3e \u00d7L Act \u03a3e and R(\u3008\u3008li,ai\u3009 : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009,\u3008\u3008vi,bi\u3009 : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009) iff v = tAct(l,b). Then ISAct,r |= \u2203 \u25e6\u03d5 iff ISAct,r al\u2032 |= \u03d5 for some l\u2032 \u2208 R(l) and the only a \u2208 Act\u03a3e such that r al\u2032 \u2208 Rfin(ISAct). The key observation in our approach is that\nIS,r |= \u3008\u3008i1, . . . , ik\u3009\u3009 \u25e6\u03d5 iff ISAct,rAct |= \u2228\nai1\u2208Acti1\n. . . \u2228\naik\u2208Actik\nD{i1,...,ik}\u2200\u25e6\n(\nk \u2227\nj=1\nai j \u21d2 \u03d5\n)\n(4)\nFor this observation to work without refering to the actions in the particular interpreted system, given an arbitrary IS, we enrich it with dedicated actions which are linked to the objectives occurring in the considered formula. We define the transition function on these actions so that if a particular \u25e6\u03d5-objective can be achieved at finite run r at all, then it can be achieved by taking the corresponding dedicated actions at the last state of r. This can be achieved in forest-like systems where runs can be determined from their final states. Similarly, we introduce express actions for the environment that enable it to foil objectives at states at which they objectives cannot be achieved by the respective coalitions using any strategy based on the original actions. (Giving the environment such powers does not affect the satisfaction of formulas as it never participates in coalitions.) The sets Acti, i \u2208 \u03a3e of atomic propositions by which we model actions satisfy the formula\nA(Act1, . . . ,ActN ,Acte)\u21cb \u2227\na1\u2208Act1\n. . . \u2227\naN\u2208ActN\n\u2227\nae\u2208Acte\n\u2203\u25e6 \u2227\ni\u2208\u03a3e\nai,\nwhich states that any vector of actions from Act\u03a3e produces a transition. Consider an ATL D iR formula of the form below with no occurrences of (.U.)-objectives:\n\u03c7 \u2227D /0\u2200\u2737A(Act1, . . . ,ActN ,Acte) (5)\nHere Act1, . . . ,ActN ,Acte consist of the atomic propositions which have been introduced to eliminate \u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009 \u25e6\u03d5-subformulas so far. For the original \u03c7 we assume Acti = {nopi}, i \u2208 \u03a3e, where nopi have no specified effect. We remove the occurrences of \u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009\u25e6\u03d5-subformulas in \u03c7 working bottom-up as follows.\nProposition 9 Let a\u0393,i,\u03d5 , i \u2208 \u0393\u222a{e}, be fresh atomic propositions, Act\u2032i = Acti \u222a{a\u0393,i,\u03d5} for i \u2208 \u0393\u222a{e} and Act\u2032i = Acti for i \u2208 \u03a3\\\u0393. Then the satisfiability of\n[\u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009 \u25e6\u03d5/p]\u03c7 \u2227D /0\u2200\u2737A(Act1, . . . ,ActN ,Acte) (6)\nentails the satisfiability of the formula [\nD\u0393\u2200\u25e6\n(\n\u2227\ni\u2208\u0393 a\u0393,i,\u03d5 \u21d2 \u03d5\n)\n/p\n]\n\u03c7\u2227\nD /0\u2200\u2737\n(\nD\u0393\u2200\u25e6\n(\n\u2227\ni\u2208\u0393 a\u0393,i,\u03d5 \u21d2 \u03d5\n) \u2228P\u0393\u2200\u25e6 (a\u0393,e,\u03d5 \u21d2\u00ac\u03d5) ) \u2227\nD /0\u2200\u2737A(Act\u20321, . . . ,Act \u2032 N ,Act \u2032 e).\n(7)\nThe above proposition shows how to eliminate one by one all the occurrences of the cooperation modalities in an any given ATLDiR formula \u03c7 with the cooperation modalities appearing only in subformulas of the form \u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009 \u25e6\u03d5 and obtain a CTL+D formula \u03c7 \u2032 such that if \u03c7 is satisfiable, then so is \u03c7 \u2032. Now consider a purely-CTL+D formula of the form (5). The satisfaction of (5) requires just a transition relation for the passage of time to define as it contains no \u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009s and hence no reference to actions. That is, we assume a satisfying model of the form\nIS\u2212 = \u3008\u3008Li : i \u2208 \u03a3e\u3009, I,\u2212,V \u3009 (8)\nwhere Li, i \u2208 \u03a3e, I and V are as in interpreted systems, and \u2212 is a serial binary relation on the set of the global states L\u03a3e that represents the passage of time. We define the remaining interpreted system components as follows. We choose the set of actions of each agent i, including the environment, to be the corresponding set of atomic propositions Acti from (5). For any a \u2208 Act\u03a3e and any l \u2208 L\u03a3e we choose t(l,a) to be an arbitrary member of \u2212(l)\u2229 \u22c2\ni\u2208\u03a3e {l\u2032 \u2208 L\u03a3e : V (l \u2032,ai)}. The nonemptiness of the latter set is\nguaranteed by the validity of A(Act1, . . . ,ActN ,Acte) in IS\u2212, which states that every state has a successor\nsatisfying the conjunction \u2227\ni\u2208\u03a3e ai for any given vector of actions a \u2208 Act\u03a3e . Let IS stand for the system\nobtained by this definition of Acti, i \u2208 \u03a3e, and t. It remains to show that\nIS,r |=D\u0393\u2200\u25e6\n(\n\u2227 i\u2208\u0393 a\u0393,i,\u03d5 \u21d2 \u03d5\n)\n(9)\nis equivalent to IS,r |= \u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009 \u25e6\u03d5 for any subformula \u3008\u3008\u0393\u3009\u3009 \u25e6\u03d5 eliminated in the process of obtaining (5). For the forward direction, establishing that the actions a\u0393,i,\u03d5 , i\u2208 \u0393 provides \u0393 with a strategy to achieve \u03d5 in one step is easily done by a direct check. For the converse direction, if (9) is false, then the validity of the second conjunctive member of (7) entails that \u0393 cannot rule out the possibility that the environment can enforce \u00ac\u03d5 in one step by choosing its corresponding action a\u0393,e,\u03d5 ."}, {"heading": "Formulas of the form [[\u0393]](P\u0393\u03d5UP\u0393\u03c8)", "text": "We first note that no restriction on formulas of the respective more general form [[\u0393]](\u03d5U\u03c8) is necessary in the case of complete information.\nProposition 10 (eliminating [[\u0393]](\u03d5U\u03c8) in ATL with complete information) Let p and q be some fresh atomic propositions.
