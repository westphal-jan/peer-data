Introduction\nClustering techniques are extensively used in data analysis. Given a finite metric space, a clustering method yields a partition of the space. The output of a hierarchical clustering algorithm can be described as a nested family of partitions, as a dendrogram or as an ultrametric space. These procedures are used also in the more general setting where the input is a finite set endowed with a distance function. See [2]. In our work, the input is always a finite metric space.\nOne common type of clustering algorithms are those which are determined by a linkage function. These algorithms are called linkage-based methods and a characterization can be found in [2]. Linkage-based hierarchical clustering algorithms start with singleton clusters. Then, in the recursive formulation, the linkage function is used at every step to determine the minimal distance between clusters, Ri. Then, clusters at distance Ri are merged. The most usual methods of hierarchical clustering such as single linkage, complete linkage and average linkage are linkage-based. Herein, we refer to this type of methods as standard linkage-based methods.\nPartially supported by MTM 2012-30719, alvaro.martinezperez@uclm.es.\n1\nar X\niv :1\n31 1.\n50 68\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 0\nN ov\n2 01\nIn [14] we studied some characteristic chaining effect in hierarchical clustering. For further reference about the chaining effect see also [12]. To deal with it, different strategies have been proposed, see [7], [8] or [16]. We defined an algorithm called \u03b1-unchaining single linkage or SL(\u03b1) to avoid certain type of chaining effect. The key was to include some property, P\u03b1, so that if a pair blocks does not satisfy it, the blocks are not merged. In this case, P\u03b1 is defined so that if the blocks are chained by a single edge (which we may see as an undesired chaining) then they will not satisfy the property and they stay as separated blocks until the next step in the recursive formulation.\nTo treat other undesired chaining effects in the application of a linkage-based algorithm the same strategy can be used. First, characterizing when a pair of blocks should not be merged and then defining some unchaining condition P to prevent it. This can be generalized as well considering hierarchical clustering algorithms determined by some linkage function, `, and some unchaining condition P . We call these algorithms almost-standard linkage-based methods.\nAn important property for a hierarchical clustering method is some kind of stability under small perturbations in the input data. Otherwise, small differences may yield very different dendrograms and the significance of the hierarchical clustering can be compromised. This can be a major problem if the input is a random sample determined by some probability distribution or if the input data is only known up to a certain degree of precision. There are several papers dealing with stability of clustering and hierarchical clustering. Different approaches and different types of algorithms are considered. In [3] there is an interesting analysis on stability for clustering algorithms based on some objective function which is minimized or maximized. Other perspectives can be found in [4], [11] and [15]. In our work we focus on linkage-based algorithms. In [6], Carlson and Memoli use tools from geometric topology to study the stability of single linkage hierarchical clustering. In their paper stability is measured using Gromov-Hausdorff metric, dGH , and the following result is obtained.\nProposition 1.1. [6, Proposition 26] For any two finite metric spaces (X, dX) and (Y, dY )\ndGH(X,Y ) \u2265 dGH(TSLU (X, dX),TSLU (Y, dY )). Thus, if single linkage hierarchical clustering is applied to a pair of metric spaces\nwhich are close in the Gromov-Hausdorff metric, then the resultant ultrametric spaces are also close in this metric. Moreover, the Gromov-Hausdorff metric has the advantage that it can be used to measure the distance between any pair of metric spaces, regardless of whether they have the same number of points or not.\nThis work follows the same path. We give explicit definitions to study the stability of hierarchical clustering methods in terms of the Gromov-Hausdorff metric. First we consider the notion of being semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense for algorithms that are stable at least when the input data is close enough to an ultrametric space. Then, we define the stronger property of being stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. This definition contains the implicit approach given by Carlson and Memoli so that the condition given in Proposition 1.1 implies that SL is stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nOur purpose is to analyse the problem of Gromov-Hausdorff stability in standard and almost-standard linkage-based hierarchical clustering methods. We pay special attention to single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage and \u03b1-unchaining\nsingle linkage. However, we try to generalize our results working with arbitrary linkage functions and arbitrary unchaining conditions. Since these definitions are quite unrestricted, we must include several technical properties to avoid exotic cases and make proofs work. Nevertheless, these technical properties are trivially satisfied by the usual hierarchical clustering methods mentioned above and the theorems obtained are, in fact, very general.\nWe prove that every normal faithful standard linkage-based method is semistable. See Theorem 4.15. Therefore, if we know that the data correspond to an ultrametric space and the measures are precise, semi-stability can be good enough to obtain legitimate results and standard linkage-based methods would be adequate.\nNevertheless, in Proposition 5.17 we prove that any unchaining condition introduces some degree of instability in the method. For every admissible almoststandard linkage-based method, there exist two arbitrarily close metric spaces with a pair of blocks each such that for the first pair the unchaining condition is satisfied and for the other one is not. This instability can be stated more precisely if the linkage function is `SL. In this case, if the almost-standard linkage-based method is ordinary and the unchaining condition is minimally bridge-unchaining, then the method is not stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. See Theorem 5.24. In particular, SL(\u03b1) is not stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nThe structure of the paper is the following: Section 2 recalls the basics on hierarchical clustering and the main notations\nused herein. Section 3 presents the recursive definition of almost-standard linkage-based hi-\nerarchical clustering methods. In section 4 we define the property of being semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff\nsense. We prove that any normal, faithful, standard linkage-based HC method is semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. This includes the classical standard linkage-basedHC methods. We also prove that SL(\u03b1) is semi-stable in the GromovHausdorff sense.\nIn section 5 we define the property of being stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We prove that for every ordinary almost-standard linkage-basedHC method, T(`SL, P ), if P is minimally bridge-unchaining, then T is not stable in the GromovHausdorff sense. In particular, SL(\u03b1) is not stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nSection 6 includes a short discussion about Gromov-Hausdorff stability.\n2. Background and notation\nA dendrogram over a finite set is a nested family of partitions. This is usually represented as a rooted tree.\nLet P(X) denote the collection of all partitions of a finite set X = {x1, ..., xn}. Then, a dendrogram can also be described as a map \u03b8 : [0,\u221e)\u2192 P(X) such that:\n1. \u03b8(0) = {{x1}, {x2}, ..., {xn}}, 2. there exists T such that \u03b8(t) = X for every t \u2265 T , 3. if r \u2264 s then \u03b8(r) refines \u03b8(s), 4. for all r there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that \u03b8(r) = \u03b8(t) for t \u2208 [r, r + \u03b5].\nNotice that conditions 2 and 4 imply that there exist t0 < t1 < ... < tm such that \u03b8(r) = \u03b8(ti\u22121) for every r \u2208 [ti\u22121, ti), i = 1,m and \u03b8(r) = \u03b8(tm) = {X} for every r \u2208 [tm,\u221e).\nFor any partition {B1, ..., Bk} \u2208 P(X), the subsets Bi are called blocks.\nLet D(X) denote the collection of all possible dendrograms over a finite set X. Given some \u03b8 \u2208 D(X), let us denote \u03b8(t) = {Bt1, ..., Btk(t)}. Therefore, the nested family of partitions is given by the corresponding partitions at t0, ..., tm, this is, {Bti1 , ..., B ti k(ti) } i = 0,m.\nAn ultrametric space is a metric space (X, d) such that d(x, y) \u2264 max{d(x, z), d(z, y)} for all x, y, z \u2208 X. Given a finite metric space X let U(X) denote the set of all ultrametrics over X.\nThere is a well known equivalence between trees and ultrametrics. See [10] or [13] for a complete exposition of how to build categorical equivalences between them. In particular, this may be translated into an equivalence between dendrograms and ultrametrics:\nThus, a hierarchical clustering method T can be presented as an algorithm whose output is a a dendrogram or an ultrametric space. Let TD(X, d) denote the dendrogram obtained by applying T to a metric space (X, d) and TU (X, d) denote the corresponding ultrametric space.\nLet us define the map \u03b7 : D(X)\u2192 U(X) as follows: Given a dendrogram \u03b8 \u2208 D(X), let \u03b7(\u03b8) = u\u03b8 be such that u\u03b8(x, x\u2032) = min{r \u2265\n0 |x, x\u2032 belong to the same block of \u03b8(r)}. Proposition 2.1. [6, Theorem 9] \u03b7 is a bijection such that \u03b7 \u25e6 TD = TU .\nNotation: For any HC method T and any finite metric space (X, d), let us denote TD(X, d) = \u03b8X and TU (X, d) = (X,uX). If there is no need to distinguish the metric space we shall just write TD(X, d) = \u03b8 and TU = u.\n3. Linkage-based hierarchical clustering methods\nLet us recall the definition of some hierarchical clustering methods. We include here the description of single linkage by its t-connected components and the recursive description of single linkage, complete linkage and average linkage. We recall also the alternative description of these methods, defining the graph G`R, which we used to build our method, SL(\u03b1). This process might be useful to define other algorithms better adapted to specific problems.\nAn \u03b5-chain is a finite sequence of points x0, ..., xN that are separated by distances less or equal than \u03b5: |xi \u2212 xi+1| < \u03b5. Two points are \u03b5-connected if there is an \u03b5chain joining them. Any two points in an \u03b5-connected set can be linked by an \u03b5-chain. An \u03b5-component is a maximal \u03b5-connected subset.\nClearly, given a metric space and any \u03b5 > 0, there is a partition of X in its \u03b5-components {C\u03b51 , ..., C\u03b5k(\u03b5)}.\nLet X be a finite metric set. The single linkage HC is defined by the map \u03b8 : [0,\u221e)\u2192 P(X) such that \u03b8(t) is the partition of X in its t-components.\nLet us recall the following from [1]. For x, y \u2208 X and any (standard) clustering C of X, x \u223cC y if x and y belong\nto the same cluster in C and x 6\u223cC y, otherwise. Two (standard) clusterings C = (C1, ..., Ck) of (X, d) and C \u2032 = (C \u20321, ...C \u2032 k) of (X \u2032, d\u2032) are isomorphic clusterings, denoted (C, d) \u223c= (C \u2032, d\u2032), if there exists a bijection \u03c6 : X \u2192 X \u2032 such that for all x, y \u2208 X, d(x, y) = d\u2032(\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)) and x \u223cC y if and only if \u03c6(x) \u223cC\u2032 \u03c6(y). Definition 3.1. A linkage function is a function\n` : {(X1, X2, d) | d is a distance function over X1 \u222aX2} \u2192 R+\nsuch that,\n1. ` is representation independent: For all (X1, X2) and (X \u2032 1, X \u2032 2), if (X1, X2, d) \u223c= (X \u20321, X \u2032 2, d \u2032) (i.e., they are clustering-isomorphic), then `(X1, X2, d) = `(X \u2032 1, X \u2032 2, d \u2032). 2. ` is monotonic: For all (X1, X2) if d \u2032 is a distance function over X1 \u222aX2\nsuch that for all x \u223c{X1,X2} y, d(x, y) = d\u2032(x, y) and for all x 6\u223c{X1,X2} y, d(x, y) \u2264 d\u2032(x, y) then `(X1, X2, d\u2032) \u2265 `(X1, X2, d). 3. Any pair of clusters can be made arbitrarily distant: For any pair of data sets (X1, d1), (X2, d2), and any r in the range of `, there exists a distance function d that extends d1 and d2 such that `(X1, X2, d) > r.\nFor technical reasons, let us assume that a linkage function has a countable range. Say, the set of nonnegative algebraic real numbers.\nSome standard choices for ` are:\n\u2022 Single linkage: `SL(B,B\u2032) = min(x,x\u2032)\u2208B\u00d7B\u2032 d(x, x\u2032) \u2022 Complete linkage: `CL(B,B\u2032) = max(x,x\u2032)\u2208B\u00d7B\u2032 d(x, x\u2032) \u2022 Average linkage: `AL(B,B\u2032) = \u2211 (x,x\u2032)\u2208B\u00d7B\u2032 d(x,x \u2032)\n#(B)\u00b7#(B\u2032) where #(X) denotes the\ncardinal of the set X.\nIn [6], the authors use a recursive procedure by which they redefine SL HC, average linkage (AL) and complete linkage (CL) hierarchical clustering. We reproduce here, for completeness, their formulation.\nLet (X, d) be a finite metric space where X = {x1, ..., xn} and let L denote a family of linkage functions on X:\nL := {` : C(X)\u00d7 C(X)\u2192 R+ | ` is bounded and non-negative }\nwhere C(X) denotes the collection of all non-empty subsets of X. Fix some linkage function ` \u2208 L. Then, the recursive formulation is as follows\n1. For each R > 0 consider the equivalence relation \u223c`,R on blocks of a partition \u03a0 \u2208 P(X), given by B \u223c`,R B\u2032 if and only if there is a sequence of blocks B = B1, ..., Bs = B\n\u2032 in \u03a0 with `(Bk, Bk+1) \u2264 R for k = 1, ..., s\u2212 1. 2. Consider the sequences R0, R1, R2, ... \u2208 [0,\u221e) and \u03981,\u03982, ... \u2208 P(X) given\nby R0 = 0, \u03981 := {x1, ..., xn}, and recursively for i \u2265 1 by \u0398i+1 = \u0398i\u223c`,Ri where Ri := min{`(B,B\u2032) |B,B\u2032 \u2208 \u0398i, B 6= B\u2032} until \u0398i = {X}.\n3. Finally, let \u03b8` : [0,\u221e) \u2192 P(X) be such that \u03b8`(r) := \u0398i(r) with i(r) := max{i |Ri \u2264 r}.\nIn [14] we proposed the following formulation of the recursive algorithm:\nDefinition 3.2. We say that T is a standard linkage-based hierarchical clustering method if there is some linkage function ` such that TD can be defined recursively as follows:\n1. Let \u03981 := {x1, ..., xn} and R0 = 0. 2. For every i \u2265 1, while \u0398i 6= {X}, let Ri := min{`(B,B\u2032) |B,B\u2032 \u2208 \u0398i, B 6= B\u2032}. Then, let G`Ri be a graph whose vertices are the blocks of \u0398i and such that there is an edge joining B and B\u2032 if and only if `(B,B\u2032) \u2264 Ri. 3. Consider the equivalence relation B \u223c`,R B\u2032 if and only if B,B\u2032 are in the same connected component of G`R. Then, \u0398i+1 = \u0398i \u223c`,R . 4. Finally, let \u03b8` : [0,\u221e) \u2192 P(X) be such that \u03b8`(r) := \u0398i(r) with i(r) := max{i |Ri \u2264 r}.\nProposition 3.3. TD is a dendrogram.\nProof. It is clear by construction that \u0398i refines \u0398i+1 for every i. Now, if r < r \u2032, i(r) = max{i |Ri \u2264 r} and i(r\u2032) = max{i |Ri \u2264 r\u2032}, then i(r) \u2264 i(r\u2032). Hence, it is immediate to check that \u03b8` is a dendrogram.\nNotice, however, that the sequence (Ri) defined in the algorithm above need not be increasing:\nExample 3.4. Let ` be a linkage function defined as follows:\n`(B1, B2) := `SL(B1, B2)\n](B1) + ](B2) .\nIt is immediate to check that ` is a well defined linkage function. Let X = {0, 2, 5, 7} \u2282 R with the euclidean metric d inherited. If we apply the recursive algorithm above, then R1 = `(0, 2) = `(5, 7) = 1 and \u03981 = {{0, 2}, {5, 7}}. However, R2 = `({0, 2}, {5, 7}) = 34 < R1.\nNotice that \u03b8`(r) = {{0}, {2}, {5}, {7}} for every r < 34 and \u03b8 `(r) = {0, 2, 5, 7}\nfor every r \u2265 34 .\nDefinition 3.5. We say that a linkage function is increasing if the sequence (Ri) defined in the recursive construction is increasing.\nProposition 3.6. `SL, `CL and `AL are increasing linkage functions.\nProof. Let ` be `SL, `CL or `AL. First, notice that for any pair of blocks A1, A2, `(A1, A2) only depends of the distance between the points in A1 and A2.\nClaim: Given Ri and \u0398i, then Ri+1 > Ri. This is immediate for `SL. Let us check the proposition for ` = `CL. Let B1, B2 \u2208 \u0398i+1 and A1, A2 \u2208 \u0398i such that A1 \u2282 B1 and A2 \u2282 B2. Then, `CL(A1, A2) \u2264 `CL(A1, B2) \u2264 `CL(B1, B2). Since A1, A2 are not merged in \u0398i+1, Ri < `\nCL(A1, A2) \u2264 `CL(B1, B2). Hence, Ri+1 > Ri.\nNow, consider ` = `AL. First notice that if {a1, ..., an} \u2282 R and {b1, ..., bn} \u2282 R with\nM1 = \u2211n 1 ai n > R and M2 = \u2211m 1 bi m > R\nthen\n(1) M3 =\n\u2211n 1 ai + \u2211m 1 bi\nn+m > R.\nIt suffices to check that (n + m)M3 = nM1 + mM2 \u2265 (n + m)M3 and, therefore, M3 > R.\nLet B1, B2 \u2208 \u0398i+1, A1, A2, ..., Ak \u2208 \u0398i such that A1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Ak = B1 and C1, ..., Ck\u2032 \u2208 \u0398i with C1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222aCk\u2032 = B2. Clearly, `AL(Ai, Cj) > Ri since they are independent blocks in \u0398i. Thus, applying (1), ` AL(Ai, B2) > Ri and ` AL(B1, B2) > Ri. Hence, Ri+1 > Ri.\nNotation: Given a metric space (X, d) let\n(2) \u2206(X, d) := {d(x, y) |x, y \u2208 X} this is, the set of all possible distances between points in (X, d).\nDefinition 3.7. Let P be any condition on the set of pairs of blocks which depends on a parameter R. We say that P is an unchaining condition if for every pair of blocks B,B\u2032 there is some R0 > 0 such that {B1, B2} satisfies P for every R > R0.\nDefinition 3.8. We say that T is an almost-standard linkage-based hierarchical clustering method if there is an unchaining condition P such that TD can be defined as follows.\n1. Let \u03981 := {x1, ..., xn}, \u03980 = \u2205 and R0 = 0. 2. For every i \u2265 1, while \u0398i\u22121 6= {X}:\na) if \u0398i 6= \u0398i\u22121 let Ri := min{`(B,B\u2032) |B,B\u2032 \u2208 \u0398i, B 6= B\u2032}, b) if \u0398i = \u0398i\u22121 and there exist B,B\n\u2032 \u2208 \u0398i such that `(B,B\u2032) > Ri\u22121, let Ri := min{`(B,B\u2032) |B,B\u2032 \u2208 \u0398i and `(B,B\u2032) > Ri\u22121}, c) if \u0398i = \u0398i\u22121 and there are no blocks B,B \u2032 \u2208 \u0398i such that `(B,B\u2032) >\nRi\u22121, then let Ri := min{R | there exist B,B\u2032 \u2208 \u0398i such that {B,B\u2032} satisfies P for R}. Then, let G`Ri be a graph whose vertices are the blocks of \u0398i and such that there is an edge joining two blocks, B and B\u2032, if and only if the following two conditions hold.\ni) `(B,B\u2032) \u2264 Ri ii) {B,B\u2032} satisfies condition P for Ri.\n3. Consider the equivalence relation B \u223c`,Ri B\u2032 if and only if B,B\u2032 are in the same connected component of G`Ri . Then, \u0398i+1 = \u0398i \u223c`,Ri . 4. Finally, let \u03b8` : [0,\u221e) \u2192 P(X) be such that \u03b8`(r) := \u0398i(r) with i(r) := max{i |Ri \u2264 r}.\nIn this case, we say that P is the unchaining condition of the method. Hence, an almost-standard linkage-based HC method is defined by a linkage function `, some property P . Let us denote T = T(`;P ).\nRemark 3.9. Notice that step 2 has to deal with some technical difficulties which do no show up in the case of standard linkage-based algorithms. Without conditions b) and c), the algorithm may not finish. However, condition c) may be a problem for practical uses.\nAn alternative procedure to assure that the algorithm will not enter into an infinite loop is to begin by choosing an ordered set containing all possible distances between blocks, R = {R0, ..., Rm} with Ri > Ri\u22121, making sure that Rm is big enough so that \u03b8(Rm) = X. If the linkage function is `\nSL or `CL this may be easily solved considering R = {R0, ..., Rm} to be the ordered set of distances between the points in the sample (X, d), i.e. R = \u2206(X, d). In this case, all possible distances between blocks are contained in \u2206(X, d) and the resulting dendrogram will be the same as applying the formal algorithm above. Nevertheless, we believe that for the general statement of almost-standard linkange-based methods is better not to include any election a priori of the sequence (Ri).\nExample 3.10. Notice that TSL = T(` SL, \u2205).\nLet us recall here the definition of SL(\u03b1) from [14]: Given a finite metric space (X, d), let Ft(X, d) be the Rips (or Vietoris-Rips) complex of (X, d). Let us recall that the Rips complex of a metric space (X, d) is a simplicial complex whose vertices are the points of X and [v1, ..., vk] is a simplex\nof Ft(X, d) if and only if d(vi, vj) \u2264 t for every i, j. Given any subset Y \u2282 X, by Ft(Y ) we refer to the subcomplex of Ft(X) defined by the vertices in Y . R = {R0, ..., Rm} = \u2206(X, d) with Ri > Ri\u22121. Clearly, R0 = 0. Let the dendrogram defined by SL(\u03b1), \u03b8\u03b1, be as follows:\n1) Let \u03b8\u03b1(0) := {{x1}, ..., {xn}} and \u03b8\u03b1(r) := \u03b8\u03b1(0) \u2200r < R1. Now, given \u03b8\u03b1[Ri\u22121, Ri) = \u03b8\u03b1(Ri\u22121) = {B1, ..., Bm}, we define recursively \u03b8\u03b1 on the interval [Ri, Ri+1) as follows: 2) LetGRi\u03b1 be a graph with vertices V(GRi\u03b1 ) := {B1, ..., Bm} and edges E(GRi\u03b1 ) := {Bi, Bj} such that the following conditions hold:\ni) min{d(x, y) |x \u2208 Bi, y \u2208 Bj} \u2264 Ri. ii) there is a simplex \u2206 \u2208 FRi(Bi \u222aBj) such that \u2206\u2229Bi 6= \u2205, \u2206\u2229Bj 6= \u2205\nand \u03b1 \u00b7 dim(\u2206) \u2265 min{dim(FRi(Bi)), dim(FRi(Bj))}. 3) Let us define a relation, \u223cRi,\u03b1 as follows.\nLet Bi \u223cRi,\u03b1 Bj if Bi, Bj belong to the same connected component of the graph GRi\u03b1 . Then, \u223cRi,\u03b1 induces an equivalence relation. 4) For every r \u2208 [Ri, Ri+1), \u03b8\u03b1(r) := \u03b8\u03b1(Ri\u22121)/ \u223cRi,\u03b1. Here, the unchaining condition ii) is defined to avoid the chaining effect which\nautomatically merges two blocks when the minimal distance between them is small. See [14].\nExample 3.11. SL(\u03b1) is an almost-standard linkage-based hierarchical clustering method: SL(\u03b1) = (`SL, P\u03b1) where given Bj , Bk \u2208 \u0398i, {Bj , Bk} satisfies P\u03b1 for Ri if there is a simplex \u2206 \u2208 FRi(Bj \u222a Bk) such that \u2206 \u2229 Bj 6= \u2205, \u2206 \u2229 Bk 6= \u2205 and \u03b1 \u00b7 dim(\u2206) \u2265 min{dim(FRi(Bj)), dim(FRi(Bk))}.\n4. Semi-stability of HC methods.\nLet us recall the definition of Gromov-Hausdorff distance from [5]. See also [9]. Let (X, dX) and (Y, dY ) be two metric spaces. A correspondence (between A\nand B) is a subset \u03c4 \u2208 A\u00d7B such that \u2022 \u2200 a \u2208 A, there exists b \u2208 B s.t. (a, b) \u2208 \u03c4 \u2022 \u2200 b \u2208 B, there exists a \u2208 A s.t. (a, b) \u2208 \u03c4\nLet T (A,B) denote the set of all possible correspondences between A and B. Let \u0393X,Y : X \u00d7 Y \u00d7X \u00d7 Y \u2192 R+ given by\n(x, y, x\u2032, y\u2032) 7\u2192 |dX(x, x\u2032)\u2212 dY (y, y\u2032)|. Then, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between X and Y is:\ndGH(X,Y ) := 1\n2 inf \u03c4\u2208T (X,Y ) sup (x,y)(x\u2032,y\u2032)\u2208\u03c4 \u0393X,Y (x, y, x\n\u2032, y\u2032).\nNotation: Let (M, dGH) denote the set of finite metric spaces with the GromovHausdorff metric and (U , dGH) denote the set of finite ultrametric spaces with the Gromov-Hausdorff metric.\nDefinition 4.1. A HC method T is faithful if for any ultrametric space (U, d), TU (U, d) = (U, d).\nThe following appears as Proposition 4.6 in [14]. We include the proof for completeness.\nProposition 4.2. TSL is faithful.\nProof. By definition, it is clear that uSL(x, y) \u2264 d(x, y) for every x, y \u2208 X. Let us see that, if (X, d) is an ultrametric space, then uSL(x, y) \u2265 d(x, y). uSL(x, y) = inf{t | there exists a t-chain joining x to y}. Suppose uSL(x, y) = t and let x = x0, x1, ..., xn = y a t-chain joining x to y. By the properties of the ultrametric, d(xi\u22121, xi+1) \u2264 max{d(xi\u22121, xi), d(xi, xi+1)} \u2264 t for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121. Therefore, d(x, y) \u2264 t and uSL(x, y) \u2265 d(x, y).\nProposition 4.3. TCL and TAL are faithful.\nProof. Let (X,u) be a finite ultrametric space and \u2206(X, d) = {0 = t0 < t1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < tm}.\nLet us check that TSLD (U, d) = T CL D (U, d) = T AL D (U, d). Therefore, by Proposition\n4.2, TCLU (U, d) = T AL U (U, d) = (U, d).\nLet TSLD (U, d) = \u03b8SL, T CL D (U, d) = \u03b8CL and T CL D (U, d) = \u03b8CL.\nFor t0 = 0, every point of U is a block in \u03b8CL(t0) or \u03b8AL(t0) and \u03b8CL(t0) = \u03b8AL(t0) = \u03b8SL(t0).\nNow, suppose that \u03b8CL(ti\u22121) = \u03b8AL(ti\u22121) = \u03b8SL(ti\u22121). Then, the blocks are exactly the balls of radius ti\u22121. Let B,B\n\u2032 \u2208 \u03b8SL(ti\u22121). Let x0 \u2208 B and y0 \u2208 B\u2032 be such that d(x0, y0) = min(x,x\u2032)\u2208B\u00d7B\u2032 d(x, x\n\u2032). Then, d(x0, y0) > ti\u22121 and, by the properties of the ultrametric, for every pair of points (x, x\u2032) \u2208 B \u00d7 B\u2032, d(x, x\u2032) \u2264 max{ti\u22121, d(x0, y0)} = d(x0, y0). Thus, `CL(B,B\u2032) = max(x,x\u2032)\u2208B\u00d7B\u2032 d(x, x\u2032) \u2264 d(x0, y0) and `\nAL(B,B\u2032) \u2264 d(x0, y0). Therefore, `CL(B,B\u2032) = `AL(B,B\u2032) = `SL(B,B\u2032) and \u03b8CL(ti) = \u03b8AL(ti) =\n\u03b8SL(ti). Since \u03b8CL(tm) = \u03b8AL(tm) = \u03b8SL(tm) = X, this completes the proof.\nThe following is part of Corollary 8.9 in [14].\nProposition 4.4. SL(\u03b1) is faithful\nDefinition 4.5. A HC method T is semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense if for any sequence of finite metric spaces ((Xk, dk))k\u2208N in (M, dGH) such that limk\u2192\u221e(Xk, dk) = (U, d) \u2208 U then limk\u2192\u221e TU (Xk, dk) = TU (U, d).\nTherefore, a faithful HC method T is semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense if for any sequence of finite metric spaces ((Xk, dk))k\u2208N in (M, dGH) such that limk\u2192\u221e(Xk, dk) = (U, d) \u2208 U then limk\u2192\u221e TU (Xk, dk) = (U, d).\nProposition 4.6. TSL is semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nProof. This is an immediate consequence of [6, Proposition 26] (see 1.1).\nRemark 4.7. There exists a sequence of metric spaces ((Xk, dk))k\u2208N in (M, dGH) and a sequence of ultrametric spaces (Uk, uk) with limk\u2192\u221e dGH((Xk, dk), (Uk, uk)) = 0 while limk\u2192\u221e dGH(T CL U (Xk, dk), (Uk, uk)) > 0. See example below.\nExample 4.8. Let Xk := {ai}\u22122\u2264i\u2264k \u222a {bi}\u22122\u2264i\u2264k and dk such that: dk(a\u22122, b\u22122) = 1. dk(a\u22121, b\u22121) = 1 + \u03b4k with \u03b4k = 1 k+1 .\ndk(a\u22122, a\u22121) = 1 2 , dk(b\u22122, b\u22121) = 1 2 .\ndk(a0, ai) = 1, for i = \u22122,\u22121, dk(b0, bi) = 1, for i = \u22122,\u22121, dk(a0, bj) = 1 + \u03b4k for j < 0 and dk(aj , b0) = 1 + \u03b4k for j < 0.\nLet \u03b5k = \u03b4k 2 .\ndk(am, ai) = 1 + m\u03b5k, for every 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k, i < m, dk(bm, bi) = 1 + m\u03b5k, for every m \u2265 1, i < m, dk(am, bi) = 1 +m\u03b5k + \u03b4k, for every 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k, i \u2264 m, and dk(bm, ai) = 1 +m\u03b5k + \u03b4k for every 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k, i \u2264 m.\n1\n1+\u03b4 0\n1 1\n1 1\na-2 b-2\na-1\na0\nb-1\nb0\n(X0,d0)\n1/2 1/2\nLet Uk := {a\u0303i}\u22122\u2264i\u2264k \u222a {b\u0303i}\u22122\u2264i\u2264k and uk : U \u00d7 U \u2192 R as follows: uk(a\u0303j , b\u0303j) = 1 for j = \u22122,\u22121, 0. uk(a\u0303\u22122, a\u0303\u22121) = 1 2 , uk(b\u0303\u22122, b\u0303\u22121) = 1 2 . uk(a\u03030, a\u0303i) = 1, for i = \u22122,\u22121, uk(b\u03030, b\u0303i) = 1, for i = \u22122,\u22121 uk(a\u0303n, a\u0303i) = 1 + n\u03b5k, for every n \u2265 1, i < n, uk(b\u0303n, b\u0303i) = 1 + n\u03b5k, for every n \u2265 1, i < n, uk(a\u0303n, b\u0303i) = 1 +n\u03b5k, for every n \u2265 1, i \u2264 n, and uk(b\u0303n, a\u0303i) = 1 +n\u03b5k for every n \u2265 1, i \u2264 n.\nLet us see that dGH((Xk, dk), (Uk, uk)) \u2264 \u03b4k = 1k+1 . It suffices to consider the correspondence \u03c4 = {(ai, a\u0303i) | i \u2265 \u22122} \u222a {(bj , b\u0303j) | j \u2265 \u22122}. Then, for every (x, y), (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 , |dk(x, x\u2032)\u2212 uk(y, y\u2032)| \u2264 \u03b4k.\nNow, let us see that ukCL(a\u22122, b\u22122) = 1 + (k)\u03b5 + \u03b4k for every k \u2265 1. For t < 12 , \u03b8CL(t) = {a\u22122, ..., ak, b\u22122, ..., bk}. For 1 2 \u2264 t < 1, it is trivial to check that a\u22122 is merged with a\u22121 and b\u22122 is merged with b\u22121. Therefore, \u03b8CL(t) = {{a\u22122, a\u22121}, a0, ..., ak, {b\u22122, b\u22121}, b0, ..., bk}.\nFor t = 1, notice that `CL(a0, {a\u22122, a\u22121}) = 1 = `CL(b0, {b\u22122, b\u22121}) while `CL({a\u22122, a\u22121}, {b\u22122, b\u22121}) = 1 + \u03b4k > 1. The rest of maximal distances between blocks are also greater than 1. Thus, for every 1 \u2264 t < 1 + \u03b5k, \u03b8CL(t) = {{a\u22122, a\u22121, a0}, a1, ..., ak, {b\u22122, b\u22121, b0}, b1, ..., bk}.\nSuppose that for some 1 \u2264 m < k and for every 1 + (m\u2212 1)\u03b5k \u2264 t < 1 +m\u03b5k we have that \u03b8CL(t) = {{a\u22122, ..., am\u22121}, am, ..., ak, {b\u22122, ..., bm\u22121}, bm, ..., bk}. Again, `CL(am, {a\u22122, ..., am\u22121}}) = 1 + m\u03b5k, `CL(bm, {b\u22122, ..., bm\u22121}) = 1 + m\u03b5k and `CL({a\u22122, ..., am\u22121}, {b\u22122, ..., bm\u22121}) = 1+m\u03b5k+\u03b4k. The rest of maximal distances between blocks are also greater than 1+m\u03b5k. Therefore, for every 1+m\u03b5k \u2264 t < 1+ (m+1)\u03b5k we have that \u03b8CL(t) = {{a\u22122, ..., am}, am+1, ..., ak, {b\u22122, ..., bm}, bm+1, ..., bk}.\nThus, ukCL(a\u22122, b\u22122) = 1+k\u03b5+\u03b4k = 1+k 1 2(k+1)+ 1 k+1 > 3 2 while uk(a\u0303\u22122, b\u0303\u22122) = 1.\nNotation: Given two metrics d, d\u2032 defined on a set X, let us denote d \u2264 d\u2032 if d(x, x\u2032) \u2264 d\u2032(x, x\u2032) \u2200x, x\u2032 \u2208 X.\nGiven a HC method T = (`, \u2205), let us recall the notations: TD(X, d) = \u03b8X and TU (X, d) = (X,uX).\nDefinition 4.9. A HC method T = T(`, \u2205) is normal if for every metric space, X, and \u2200B1, B2 \u2208 \u03b8X(t), then `(B1, B2) \u2264 `CL(B1, B2) and uX \u2265 uSL.\nLemma 4.10. uX \u2265 uSL if and only if \u2200 B \u2208 \u03b8X(t), B is t-connected.\nProof. If uX \u2265 uSL, it is immediate to check that \u2200x, y \u2208 X, if uX(x, y) \u2264 t, uSL(x, y) \u2264 t and x, y are in the same t-component.\nLet x, y \u2208 X such that uX(x, y) = t. Then, there exist some B \u2208 \u03b8X(t) such that x, y \u2208 B. If \u2200 B \u2208 \u03b8X(t), B is t-connected, then B is contained in some block of \u03b8SL(t). Therefore, uSL(x, y) \u2264 t.\nLemma 4.11. Let T = T(`, \u2205) be such that for every metric space, X, and any t > 0, \u2200B1, B2 \u2208 \u03b8X(t), `(B1, B2) \u2264 `CL(B1, B2). Then, \u2200 t > 0 and every B1, B2 \u2208 \u03b8X(t), max{d(x, y) |x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2} > t.\nProof. Let ki := max{kr \u2264 t : kr \u2208 \u2206(X,uX)}. Then, B1, B2 are blocks in \u03b8X(t) = \u03b8X(ki).\nIf max{d(x, y) |x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2} \u2264 t, then `(B1, B2) \u2264 `CL(B1, B2) \u2264 t. Therefore, B1 \u223c`,t B2 which contradicts the fact that B1, B2 are blocks in \u03b8X(t).\nHence, max{d(x, y) |x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2} > t.\nLemma 4.12. Let (X, d) be a finite metric space with \u2206(X, d) = {ti : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n} and (U, u) be an ultrametric space with dGH((X, d), (U, u)) < \u03b4 2 . Let T = T(`, \u2205) be a normal HC method. Given x, x\u2032 \u2208 X with d(x, x\u2032) = ti, if uX(x, x\u2032) > tj\u22121 \u2265 ti, then tj \u2264 tj\u22121 + 2\u03b4.\nProof. Let B1, B2 \u2208 \u03b8X(tj\u22121) with x \u2208 B1 and x\u2032 \u2208 B2. Let kr \u2208 \u2206(TU (X, d)) be such that kr\u22121 \u2264 tj\u22121 < kr. Then, \u03b8X(tj\u22121) = \u03b8X(kr\u22121).\nLet a \u2208 B1 and a\u2032 \u2208 B2 with d(a, a\u2032) = max{d(x, y) |x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2}. Since B1, B2 are different blocks in \u03b8X(tj\u22121), by Lemma 4.11, d(a, a\n\u2032) > tj\u22121 \u2265 kr\u22121 and d(a, a\u2032) \u2265 tj .\nLet \u03c4 be a correspondence such that sup(z,u)(z\u2032,u\u2032)\u2208\u03c4 \u0393X,U (z, u, z \u2032, u\u2032) < \u03b4 and let (a, b), (a\u2032, b\u2032), (x, y), (y, y\u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 . See Figure 3. By Lemma 4.10, every block in \u03b8X(tj\u22121) is tj\u22121-connected and there exist tj\u22121-chains in (X, d) from a to x and from a\u2032 to x\u2032. Since d(x, x\u2032) = ti \u2264 tj\u22121, there is a tj\u22121-chain from a to a\u2032.\nTherefore, since sup(z,u)(z\u2032,u\u2032)\u2208\u03c4 \u0393X,U (z, u, z \u2032, u\u2032) < \u03b4, there is a (tj\u22121 + \u03b4)-chain from b to b\u2032. By the properties of the ultrametric, this implies that u(b, b\u2032) \u2264 tj\u22121+\u03b4 and, therefore, d(a, a\u2032) \u2264 tj\u22121 + 2\u03b4.\nSince uX(x, x \u2032) \u2265 kr, then tj\u22121 < kr \u2264 `(B1, B2) \u2264 d(a, a\u2032) < tj\u22121 + 2\u03b4. In\nparticular, tj < tj\u22121 + 2\u03b4.\nThe following proposition is a particular case of Theorem 4.15. We include this proposition and the proof of this particular case because we feel that it may help to clarify the proof of the theorem.\nProposition 4.13. Let (U, u) be an ultrametric space such that \u2206(U, u) is finite (in particular, if (U, u) is a finite ultrametric space). Let T = (`, \u2205) be any normal standard linkage-based HC method. Then, for any sequence of finite metric spaces ((Xk, dk))k\u2208N in (M, dGH) such that limk\u2192\u221e(Xk, dk) = (U, d) \u2208 U , limk\u2192\u221e TU (Xk, dk) = (U, d).\nProof. Let \u2206(U, u) = {u0, ..., up} and let 0 < \u03b5 < ui\u2212ui\u22121 for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p. Let \u03b4 < 14\u03b5 and suppose dGH((Xk, dk), (U, u)) < \u03b4 2 . Then, there is a correspondence \u03c4 such that for any (x, y), (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 , |dk(x, x\u2032)\u2212 u(y, y\u2032)| < \u03b4. Let TU (Xk, dk) = (Xk, uk) and TD(Xk, dk) = \u03b8k. Claim: u(y, y\u2032) \u2264 uk(x, x\u2032) + \u03b4 < uk(x, x\u2032) + \u03b5. Let uk(x, x\n\u2032) = kr \u2208 \u2206(Xk, uk). Then, there exist B0, B1, ..., Bn \u2208 \u03b8k(kr\u22121) with x \u2208 B0, x\u2032 \u2208 Bn and `(Bj\u22121, Bj) \u2264 kr for every 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. By Lemma 4.10 each Bj is (kr\u22121)-connected. Then, there is a kr-chain in (Xk, dk) from x\n\u03b8X(tj-1)\nto x\u2032: x = x0, ..., xn = x \u2032. Let (xj , yj) \u2208 R for every 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Then, since |dk(xj\u22121, xj) \u2212 u(yj\u22121, yj)| < \u03b4, y = y0, ..., yn = y\u2032 is a (kr + \u03b4)-chain in (U, u). Since (U, u) is ultrametric, this implies that u(y, y\u2032) \u2264 kr + \u03b4.\nClaim: uk(x, x \u2032) \u2264 u(y, y\u2032) + \u03b5.\nLet (x, y), (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2208 R. Let dk(x, x\u2032) = ti and u(y, y\u2032) = t. We already know that |ti \u2212 t| < \u03b4.\nIf uk(x, x \u2032) \u2264 ti, then uk(x, x\u2032) \u2264 dk(x, x\u2032) \u2264 u(y, y\u2032) + \u03b4 and we are done. Suppose uk(x, x \u2032) = kr \u2208 [ti+m\u22121, ti+m) with m \u2265 1. By Lemma 4.12, for every 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, ti+k \u2212 ti+k\u22121 \u2264 2\u03b4. For every i \u2264 j < i+m, consider Btj1 , B tj 2 \u2208 \u03b8k(tj) with x \u2208 B tj 1 , x\n\u2032 \u2208 Btj2 and let aj \u2208 B tj 1 and a \u2032 j \u2208 B tj 2 with dk(aj , a \u2032 j) = max{dk(x, y) |x \u2208 B tj 1 , y \u2208 B tj 2 }. The situation is the same from Lemma 4.12, see Figure 3. Let (aj , bj), (a \u2032 j , b \u2032 j) \u2208 R. Hence, for every i \u2264 j < i+m, dk(aj+1, a\u2032j+1)\u2212 dk(aj , a\u2032j) \u2264 tj + 2\u03b4 \u2212 tj = 2\u03b4. Therefore, u(bj+1, b \u2032 j+1)\u2212 u(bj , b\u2032j) \u2264 4\u03b4. Since 4\u03b4 < \u03b5, it follows that u(bj+1, b\u2032j+1) = u(bj , b\u2032j) for every i \u2264 j < i + m. Then, d(ai+m, a\u2032i+m) \u2212 d(ai, a\u2032i) \u2264 2\u03b4 and uk(x, x\u2032) \u2264 ti + 2\u03b4 \u2264 u(y, y\u2032) + 3\u03b4 < u(y, y\u2032) + \u03b5 proving the claim.\nIn the previous proposition it is possible to eliminate the condition on the ultrametric space. The main idea of the proof is the same in spite of some technical difficulties.\nLemma 4.14. Let (X, d) be a finite metric space, (U, u) be an ultrametric space and let \u03b5 > 0. If dGH((X, d), (U, u)) < \u03b5 2 , then \u2206(U, u) has a finite number of distances greater than \u03b5.\nProof. Suppose dGH((Xk, dk), (U, u)) < \u03b5 2 . Then, there is a correspondence \u03c4 such that for any (x, y), (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 , |dk(x, x\u2032) \u2212 u(y, y\u2032)| < \u03b5. Since Xk is finite, let Xk = {x1, ..., xn} and let (xi, yi) \u2208 \u03c4 . Then, {B(yi, \u03b5) | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n} defines a finite covering of U . Therefore, by the properties of the ultrametric, \u2206(U, u) has a finite number of distances greater than \u03b3.\nTheorem 4.15. Every normal, faithful, standard linkage-based HC method, T = (`, \u2205), is semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nProof. By Lemma 4.14, since limk\u2192\u221e(Xk, dk) = (U, u) with Xk finite, \u2206\u2265\u03b5(U, u) = {u(x, y) |x, y \u2208 U with u(x, u) \u2265 \u03b5} is a finite set for every \u03b5 > 0.\nLet \u03b5 > 0. Let \u2206\u2265 \u03b52 (U, u) = {l0, l1, ..., lp} with li < lj for every i < j. Let 0 < \u03b4 < 14 min1\u2264j\u2264m{lj \u2212 lj\u22121} and suppose also that 0 < \u03b4 < \u03b5 12 .\nLet (Xk, dk) be such that dGH((Xk, dk), (U, u)) < \u03b4 2 . Then, since T is faithful, it suffices to check that dGH(TU (Xk, dk), (U, u)) < \u03b5. Let \u03c4 be a correspondence such that \u2200 (x, y), (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 , |d(x, x\u2032)\u2212u(y, y\u2032)| < \u03b4. Let TU (Xk, dk) = (Xk, uk) and TD(Xk, dk) = \u03b8k. Claim: u(y, y\u2032) \u2264 uk(x, x\u2032) + \u03b4 < uk(x, x\u2032) + \u03b5. This claim is proved by the same argument used in Proposition 4.13. Let uk(x, x\n\u2032) = kr \u2208 \u2206(Xk, uk). Then, there exist B0, B1, ..., Bn \u2208 \u03b8k(kr\u22121) with x \u2208 B0, x\u2032 \u2208 Bn and `(Bj\u22121, Bj) \u2264 kr. By Lemma 4.10 Bj is (kr\u22121)-connected. Then, there is a kr-chain in (Xk, dk) from x to x \u2032: x = x0, ..., xn = x \u2032. Let (xj , yj) \u2208 \u03c4 for every 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Then, since |dk(xj\u22121, xj) \u2212 u(yj\u22121, yj)| < \u03b4, y = y0, ..., yn = y\n\u2032 is a (kr + \u03b4)-chain in (U, u). Since (U, u) is ultrametric, this implies that u(y, y\u2032) \u2264 kr + \u03b4.\nClaim: uk(x, x \u2032) \u2264 u(y, y\u2032) + \u03b5. Let (x, y), (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 . Let d(x, x\u2032) = ti and u(y, y\u2032) = t. Then, |ti \u2212 t| < \u03b4. If uk(x, x\n\u2032) \u2264 ti we are done since uk(x, x\u2032) \u2264 d(x, x\u2032) \u2264 u(y, y\u2032) + \u03b4. Then, suppose uk(x, x\n\u2032) = kr \u2208 [ti+m\u22121, ti+m) with m \u2265 1. By Lemma 4.12, for every 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, ti+k \u2212 ti+k\u22121 \u2264 2\u03b4.\nIf ti \u2265 \u03b52 + \u03b4, consider for every i \u2264 j < i + m, as in the proof of Lemma 4.12, B tj 1 , B tj 2 \u2208 \u03b8k(tj) with x \u2208 B tj 1 , x \u2032 \u2208 Btj2 and let aj \u2208 B tj 1 and a \u2032 j \u2208 B tj 2 with d(aj , a \u2032 j) = max{d(x, y) |x \u2208 B tj 1 , y \u2208 B tj 2 }. Let (aj , bj), (a\u2032j , b\u2032j) \u2208 \u03c4 . Hence, for every i \u2264 j < i + m, d(aj+1, a\u2032j+1) \u2212 d(aj , a\u2032j) \u2264 tj + 2\u03b4 \u2212 tj = 2\u03b4. Therefore, u(bj+1, b \u2032 j+1)\u2212u(bj , b\u2032j) \u2264 4\u03b4. Since u(bj , b\u2032j) > tj \u2212 \u03b4 > \u03b52 and 4\u03b4 < min1\u2264j\u2264m{lj \u2212 lj\u22121}, then u(bj+1, b\u2032j+1) = u(bj , b\u2032j) for every j. Thus, d(ai+m, a\u2032i+m)\u2212 d(ai, a\u2032i) \u2264 u(bi+m, b \u2032 i+m)\u2212 u(bi, b\u2032i) + 2\u03b4 = 2\u03b4 and uXk(x, x\u2032) \u2264 ti + 2\u03b4 \u2264 u(y, y\u2032) + 3\u03b4 proving the claim. Finally, if ti < \u03b5 2 + \u03b4, then, either uXk(x, x\n\u2032) \u2264 \u03b5 and we are done or, by Lemma 4.12, there is some ti < tk \u2208 ( \u03b52 +\u03b4, \u03b5 2 +3\u03b4). Consider, as above, for every k \u2264 j < i+ m the pairs (aj , a \u2032 j) with d(aj+1, a \u2032 j+1)\u2212d(aj , a\u2032j) \u2264 2\u03b4, (aj , bj), (a\u2032j , b\u2032j) \u2208 \u03c4 . Hence, as above, u(bk+m, b \u2032 k+m) = u(bk, b \u2032 k) for every j and d(ak+m, a \u2032 k+m)\u2212d(ak, a\u2032k) \u2264 2\u03b4. Therefore, uXk(x, x \u2032) \u2264 tk + 2\u03b4 \u2264 \u03b52 + 5\u03b4 < \u03b5 proving the claim.\nCorollary 4.16. TCL is semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nCorollary 4.17. TAL is semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nThe proof of Theorem 4.15 can be adapted to prove that SL(\u03b1) is also semistable. First, let us see that the analogue to Lemma 4.12 also works for SL(\u03b1).\nLemma 4.18. Let (X, d) be a finite metric space with \u2206(X, d) = {t0 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < tn} and (U, u) be an ultrametric space with dGH((X, d), (U, u)) < \u03b4 2 . Let T SL(\u03b1) D (X, d) = \u03b8\u03b1 and T SL(\u03b1) U (X, d) = u\u03b1 for any \u03b1 \u2265 1. Given x, x\u2032 \u2208 X with d(x, x\u2032) = ti, if u\u03b1(x, x \u2032) > tj\u22121 \u2265 ti, then tj \u2264 tj\u22121 + 2\u03b4.\nProof. Let B1, B2 \u2208 \u03b8\u03b1(tj\u22121) with x \u2208 B1 and x\u2032 \u2208 B2. Let a \u2208 B1 and a\u2032 \u2208 B2 with d(a, a\u2032) = max{d(x, y) |x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2}. Then, it follows from the construction of \u03b8\u03b1(tj\u22121) that d(a, a \u2032) \u2265 tj > tj\u22121. Suppose that d(a, a\u2032) \u2264 tj\u22121. Then, let Ba, Ba\u2032 two blocks in \u03b8\u03b1(tj\u22122) such that a \u2208 Ba, a\u2032 \u2208 Ba\u2032 . Clearly, `SL(Ba, Ba\u2032) \u2264 tj\u22121 and, since Ba \u2282 B1 and Ba\u2032 \u2282 B2, then d(a, a\u2032) = max{d(x, y) |x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2} \u2265 max{d(x, y) |x \u2208 Ba, y \u2208 Ba\u2032}. Therefore, Ftj\u22121(Ba \u222a Ba\u2032) has dimension ](Ba \u222a Ba\u2032) \u2212 1 \u2265 min{dim(Ftj\u22121(Ba)), dim(Ftj\u22121(Ba\u2032))}. Therefore, Ba andBa\u2032 are merged in \u03b8\u03b1(tj\u22121) for any \u03b1 \u2265 1 and a, a\u2032 are contained in the same block in \u03b8\u03b1(tj\u22121) which is a contradiction.\nLet \u03c4 be a correspondence such that sup(z,u)(z\u2032,u\u2032)\u2208\u03c4 \u0393X,U (z, u, z \u2032, u\u2032) < \u03b4 and let (a, b), (a\u2032, b\u2032), (x, y), (y, y\u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 . See Figure 3. It is immediate to see that every block in \u03b8\u03b1(tj\u22121) is tj\u22121-connected and there exist tj\u22121-chains in (X, d) from a to x and from a\u2032 to x\u2032. Since d(x, x\u2032) = ti \u2264 tj\u22121, there is a tj\u22121-chain from a to a\u2032.\nTherefore, there is a (tj\u22121 + \u03b4)-chain from b to b \u2032. By the properties of the ultrametric, this implies that u(b, b\u2032) \u2264 tj\u22121 + \u03b4 and, hence, d(a, a\u2032) \u2264 tj\u22121 + 2\u03b4. In particular, tj\u22121 < tj \u2264 d(a, a\u2032) \u2264 tj\u22121 + 2\u03b4.\nProposition 4.19. TSL(\u03b1) is semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nProof. By Lemma 4.14, since limk\u2192\u221e(Xk, dk) = (U, u) with Xk finite, \u2206\u2265\u03b5(U, u) = {u(x, y) |x, y \u2208 U with u(x, u) \u2265 \u03b5} is a finite set for every \u03b5 > 0.\nLet \u03b5 > 0. Let \u2206\u2265 \u03b52 (U, u) = {l0, l1, ..., lp} with li < lj for every i < j. Let 0 < \u03b4 < 14 min1\u2264j\u2264m{lj \u2212 lj\u22121} and suppose also that 0 < \u03b4 < \u03b5 12 . Let (Xk, dk) be such that dGH((Xk, dk), (U, u)) < \u03b4 2 . Then, since SL(\u03b1) is faithful, it suffices to check that dGH(TU (Xk, dk), (U, u)) < \u03b5. Let \u03c4 be a correspondence such that \u2200 (x, y), (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 , |d(x, x\u2032)\u2212u(y, y\u2032)| < \u03b4. Let T\nSL(\u03b1) U (Xk, dk) = (Xk, uk) and T SL(\u03b1) D (Xk, dk) = \u03b8k.\nClaim: u(y, y\u2032) \u2264 uk(x, x\u2032) + \u03b4 < uk(x, x\u2032) + \u03b5. Let uk(x, x\n\u2032) = kr \u2208 \u2206(Xk, uk). Then, there exist B0, B1, ..., Bn \u2208 \u03b8k(kr\u22121) with x \u2208 B0, x\u2032 \u2208 Bn and `SL(Bj\u22121, Bj) \u2264 kr. By Lemma 4.10 Bj is (kr\u22121)connected. Then, there is a kr-chain in (Xk, dk) from x to x \u2032: x = x0, ..., xn = x \u2032. Let (xj , yj) \u2208 \u03c4 for every 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Then, since |dk(xj\u22121, xj) \u2212 u(yj\u22121, yj)| < \u03b4, y = y0, ..., yn = y\n\u2032 is a (kr + \u03b4)-chain in (U, u). Since (U, u) is ultrametric, this implies that u(y, y\u2032) \u2264 kr + \u03b4.\nClaim: uk(x, x \u2032) \u2264 u(y, y\u2032) + \u03b5. Let (x, y), (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 . Let d(x, x\u2032) = ti and u(y, y\u2032) = t. Then, |ti \u2212 t| < \u03b4. If uk(x, x\n\u2032) \u2264 ti we are done since uk(x, x\u2032) \u2264 d(x, x\u2032) \u2264 u(y, y\u2032) + \u03b4. Then, suppose uk(x, x\n\u2032) = kr \u2208 [ti+m\u22121, ti+m) with m \u2265 1. By Lemma 4.18, for every 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, ti+k \u2212 ti+k\u22121 \u2264 2\u03b4.\nIf ti \u2265 \u03b52 + \u03b4, consider for every i \u2264 j < i + m, B tj 1 , B tj 2 \u2208 \u03b8k(tj) with x \u2208 B tj 1 ,\nx\u2032 \u2208 Btj2 and let aj \u2208 B tj 1 and a \u2032 j \u2208 B tj 2 with d(aj , a \u2032 j) = max{d(x, y) |x \u2208 B tj 1 , y \u2208 B tj 2 }. Let (aj , bj), (a\u2032j , b\u2032j) \u2208 \u03c4 . Hence, for every i \u2264 j < i + m, d(aj+1, a\u2032j+1) \u2212 d(aj , a \u2032 j) \u2264 tj + 2\u03b4 \u2212 tj = 2\u03b4. Therefore, u(bj+1, b\u2032j+1) \u2212 u(bj , b\u2032j) \u2264 4\u03b4. Since u(bj , b \u2032 j) > tj \u2212 \u03b4 > \u03b52 and 4\u03b4 < min1\u2264j\u2264m{lj \u2212 lj\u22121}, then u(bj+1, b \u2032 j+1) = u(bj , b \u2032 j) for every j. Thus, d(ai+m, a \u2032 i+m) \u2212 d(ai, a\u2032i) \u2264 u(bi+m, b\u2032i+m) \u2212 u(bi, b\u2032i) + 2\u03b4 = 2\u03b4 and uXk(x, x \u2032) \u2264 ti + 2\u03b4 \u2264 u(y, y\u2032) + 3\u03b4 proving the claim.\nFinally, if ti < \u03b5 2 + \u03b4, then, either uXk(x, x \u2032) \u2264 \u03b5 and we are done or, by Lemma 4.18, there is some ti < tk \u2208 ( \u03b52 +\u03b4, \u03b5 2 +3\u03b4). Consider, as above, for every k \u2264 j < i+ m the pairs (aj , a \u2032 j) with d(aj+1, a \u2032 j+1)\u2212d(aj , a\u2032j) \u2264 2\u03b4, (aj , bj), (a\u2032j , b\u2032j) \u2208 R. Hence, as above, u(bk+m, b \u2032 k+m) = u(bk, b \u2032 k) for every j and d(ak+m, a \u2032 k+m)\u2212d(ak, a\u2032k) \u2264 2\u03b4. Therefore, uXk(x, x \u2032) \u2264 tk + 2\u03b4 \u2264 \u03b52 + 5\u03b4 < \u03b5 proving the claim.\n5. Stability of HC methods.\nDefinition 5.1. A HC method T is stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense if\nTU : (M, dGH)\u2192 (U , dGH) is continuous.\nThus, SL HC is stable in the Gromov-Hasudorff sense. Notation: Let H(T, \u03b5) be the set of finite metric spaces, (X, d), such that \u03b8X(\u03b5) has exactly two blocks, where \u03b8X = TD(X, t). In particular, H(TSL, \u03b5) denotes the set of finite metric spaces with exactly two \u03b5-components.\nNotation: Let I(a1, ..., an) denote the isometry type of the finite metric space defined by the points {p\u03040, p\u03041, ..., p\u0304n} where d(p\u0304i, p\u0304j) = ai+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+aj for every i < j (this is, the isometry type of the set {0, a1, a1 + a2, ..., a1 + a2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ an} \u2282 R with the euclidean metric). See Figure 4. In particular,\nI(R) = ( {p\u03040, p\u03041}, ( R 0 0 R )) Example 5.2. TAL and TCL are not stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nConsider (X, d) = I(1, 1) and (Y, d\u2032) = I(1, 1 + \u03b4) with \u03b4 > 0 arbitrarily small. First, notice that dGH((X, d), (Y, d\n\u2032)) = \u03b4. It is immediate to check that TALU (X) = T CL U (X) = (X,u) with X = {x1, x2, x3}\nand u(xi, xj) = 1 for every i 6= j. Let TALU (Y ) = (Y, u1) and T CL U (Y ) = (Y, u2). Now, Y = {y1, y2, y3}, u1(y1, y2) = 1 and u1(y1, y3) = u1(y2, y3) = 3+2\u03b4\n2 . Also, u2(y1, y2) = 1 and u2(y1, y3) = u2(y2, y3) = 2 + \u03b4.\nThus, it can be seen that dGH(T AL U (X, d),T AL U (Y, d \u2032)) = 1+2\u03b44 > 1 4 . Similarly,\ndGH(T CL U (X, d),T CL U (Y, d \u2032)) = 2+\u03b42 > 1. Therefore, AL and CL are not stable.\nDefinition 5.3. Let T = T(`;P ) be a HC method. We say that P is nontrivial for ` if there exists some metric space (X, d) such that for TD(X, d) = \u03b8 and for some \u03b5 > 0, \u03b8(\u03b5) = {B1, B2}, `(B1, B2) = R > \u03b5 and {B1, B2} does not satisfy P for R.\nRemark 5.4. For any HC method T = T(`SL;P ), P is nontrivial for `SL if there exists some metric space (X, d) with two \u03b5-components B1, B2, such that `SL(B1, B2) = R > \u03b5 and {B1, B2} does not satisfy P for R.\nLet (X, d0) be any metric space and B1, B2 a non-trivial partition of X (this is, X = B1 \u222aB2 with B1 \u2229B2 = \u2205 and B1, B2 6= \u2205). Let R > 0 and let\n(3) \u0393B1,B2R : [0, 1]\u2192M\nbe defined as follows: \u0393B1,B2R (0) = (X, d0), \u0393 B1,B2 R (1) = I(R) and for every t \u2208 (0, 1), \u0393(t) = (X, dt) with\ndt(x, y) =\n{ (1\u2212 t)d0(x, y) if x, y \u2208 B1 or x, y \u2208 B2\n(1\u2212 t)d0(x, y) + tR if x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2 or y \u2208 B1, x \u2208 B2\nProposition 5.5. \u0393B1,B2R is well defined.\nProof. Let us see that dt is a metric for every t \u2208 (0, 1). It suffices to check that the triangle inequality holds for every t \u2208 (0, 1). Let x, y, x \u2208 X. We know that d(x, z) \u2264 d(x, y) + d(x, z).\nIf x, z are in the same block, Bi, then it is trivial to see that dt(x, z) = (1 \u2212 t)d(x, z) \u2264 (1\u2212 t)[d(x, y) + d(y, z)] \u2264 dt(x, y) + dt(x, z).\nIf x, z are not in the same block, then dt(x, z) = (1 \u2212 t)d(x, z) + tR \u2264 (1 \u2212 t)[d(x, y) + d(y, z)] + tR = dt(x, y) + dt(x, z).\nHence, triangle inequality holds.\nProposition 5.6. \u0393B1,B2R : [0, 1] \u2192 (M, dGH) is continuous (with the euclidean metric on [0, 1]).\nProof. First, let us see that \u0393B1,B2R is continuous on [0, 1).\nFor any s1, s2 \u2208 [0, 1), consider the correspondence defined by the identity: \u03c4 = {(x, x) |x \u2208 X}. Then, |ds1(x, y)\u2212ds2(x, y)| \u2264 |(s2\u2212s1)d(x, y)|+|(s2\u2212s1)R| = |s2 \u2212 s1|(d(x, y) +R).\nThen, if |s2 \u2212 s1| < \u03b3, dGH((X, ds1), (X, ds2)) \u2264 12 |s2 \u2212 s1|(d(x, y) + R) \u2264 \u03b3 diam(X,d)+R2 . Thus, \u2200 \u03b4 > 0 and for any \u03b3 \u2264 2\u03b4 diam(X)+R , if |s2 \u2212 s1| < \u03b3, then dGH((X, ds1), (X, ds2)) \u2264 \u03b4. To check the continuity of \u0393B1,B2R at t = 1 consider the correspondence \u03c4\n\u2032 = {(B1, p\u03040)\u222a (B2, p\u03041)}. Then, if x, y are in the same block Bi, |dt(x, y)\u2212d1(p\u0304i, p\u0304i)| = (1\u2212t)d(x, y) \u2264 (1\u2212t)diam(X). If x, y are in different blocks, |dt(x, y)\u2212d1(p\u03040, p\u03041)| = |(1 \u2212 t)d(x, y) + tR \u2212 R| \u2264 (1 \u2212 t)[d(x, y) + R] \u2264 (1 \u2212 t)[diam(X) + R]. Thus, dGH((X, dt), I(R)) \u2264 (1 \u2212 t)diam(X)+R2 . Hence, for any \u03b4 > 0, if 1 \u2212 2\u03b4 diam(X)+R < t < 1, then dGH((X, dt), IR) \u2264 \u03b4. Therefore, \u0393B1,B2R is continuous.\nDefinition 5.7. Let ` be a linkage function. We say that a ` is \u0393-regular if given any finite metric space (X, d0) and any non-trivial partition of X, B1, B2, with `(B1, B2) = R, then `R,dt(B1, B2) = R for every t \u2208 [0, 1) where `R,dt denotes the linkage function ` when it is applied to a pair of blocks in \u0393B1,B2R (t) = (X, dt).\nProposition 5.8. `SL, `CL and `AL are \u0393-regular.\nProof. In the case of `SL it is immediate to check that the minimal distance, R, between B1 and B2 is constant on \u0393 B1,B2 R by construction.\nThe case of `CL is also trivial since the maximal distance, R, between B1 and\nB2 is constant on \u0393 B1,B2 R by construction. Consider any nontrivial partitionB1, B2 of (X, d0). LetR = \u2211 (x,x\u2032)\u2208B1\u00d7B2 d0(x,x \u2032)\n#(B1)\u00b7#(B2) .\nNow, for any t \u2208 [0, 1],\n`R,dt(B1, B2) =\n\u2211 (x,x\u2032)\u2208B1\u00d7B2 dt(x, x \u2032)\n#(B1) \u00b7#(B2) =\n\u2211 (x,x\u2032)\u2208B1\u00d7B2 [(1\u2212 t)d0(x, x \u2032) + tR]\n#(B1) \u00b7#(B2) = = (1\u2212 t) \u2211 (x,x\u2032)\u2208B1\u00d7B2 d0(x, x \u2032)\n#(B1) \u00b7#(B2) + tR = (1\u2212 t)R+ tR = R.\nDefinition 5.9. A linkage function ` is scale preserving if for any space X, any pair of disjoint blocks, A,B \u2282 X, and any pair of metrics, d, d\u2032, on X such that for some \u03b1 > 0, d\u2032(x, y) = \u03b1 \u00b7 d(x, y) \u2200x, y \u2208 X, then `d\u2032(A,B) = \u03b1 \u00b7 `d(A,B).\nRemark 5.10. It is immediate to check that `SL, `CL and `AL are scale preserving.\nLemma 5.11. Let T = T(`, \u2205) with ` scale preserving. Let (X, d) be a metric space, \u03b1 > 0 and let (X, d\u2032) be such that d\u2032(x, y) := \u03b1 \u00b7 d(x, y). Let TD(X, d) = \u03b8 and TD(X, d \u2032) = \u03b8\u2032. Then, \u03b8(t) = \u03b8\u2032(\u03b1 \u00b7 t).\nProof. In the recursive formulation of T, let us denote by \u0398Ri the partitions built for \u03b8 and by \u0398\u2032R\u2032i the partitions built for \u03b8\u2032. Clearly, \u03980 = \u0398 \u2032 0. Suppose that R\u2032i\u22121 = \u03b1 \u00b7 Ri\u22121 and \u0398Ri\u22121 = \u0398\u2032R\u2032i\u22121 = {B1, ..., Bk}. Since ` is scale preserving, it is immediate to check that `d(Bj1 , Bj2) = \u03b1 \u00b7 `d\u2032(Bj1 , Bj2) for every 1 \u2264 j1, j2 \u2264 n. Therefore, R\u2032i = \u03b1 \u00b7 Ri and \u0398Ri = \u0398\u2032\u03b1\u00b7Ri . Thus, by induction on i, it follows that \u03b8(t) = \u03b8\u2032(\u03b1 \u00b7 t) \u2200 t \u2265 0.\nLemma 5.12. Let T = T(`, \u2205), let (X, d) be a metric space and let TD(X, d) = \u03b8. Suppose \u03b8(\u03b5) = {B1, ..., Bn} and let (X, d\u2032) be such that d\u2032(x, y) = d(x, y) if x, y \u2208 Bj for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n and d\u2032(x, y) \u2265 d(x, y) for every (x, y) \u2208 Bi \u00d7 Bj with i 6= j. Then, if TD(X, d\n\u2032) = \u03b8\u2032, \u03b8\u2032(t) = \u03b8(t) for every t \u2264 \u03b5. Proof. Since linkage functions are representation independent and monotonic, for every A,B \u2282 Bj , `d(A,B) = `d\u2032(A,B) and for every (A,B) \u2282 Bi \u00d7Bj , `d(A,B) \u2264 `d\u2032(A,B).\nThen, let us apply induction on the construction of the dendrograms. Clearly, R0 = 0 = R \u2032 0 and \u03981 = \u0398 \u2032 1. Suppose R \u2032 0 = R0, ..., R \u2032 i\u22121 = Ri\u22121 and \u0398 \u2032 i = \u0398i = {C1, ..., Ck}. Then, since \u03b8(\u03b5) = {B1, ..., Bn}, if `d(Cr, Cs) = min{`(C,C \u2032) |C,C \u2032 \u2208 \u0398i, C 6= C \u2032} \u2264 \u03b5, C,C \u2032 are both contained in the same blockBj . Then, `d\u2032(Cr, Cs) = `d(Cr, Cs), R \u2032 i = Ri and \u0398 \u2032 i+1 = \u0398i+1. Therefore, \u03b8 \u2032(t) = \u03b8(t) for every t \u2264 \u03b5.\nDefinition 5.13. Let P be an unchaining condition and ` be a linkage function. We say that P is consistent for ` if the following implication holds.\nLet (X, d) be any metric space and B1, B2 any nontrivial partition of X with `d(B1, B2) = R and such that {B1, B2} does not satisfy P for R in (X, d).\nLet (X, d\u2032) be such that d\u2032(x, y) := d(x, y) for every x, y \u2208 B1 and for every x, y \u2208 B2, and d\u2032(x, y) > d(x, y) for every x, y \u2208 B1 \u00d7B2.\nThen, if `d\u2032(B1, B2) = R \u2032, B1, B2 does not satisfy P for R \u2032 in (X, d\u2032).\nLemma 5.14. Let T(`;P ) be an almost-standard linkage-based HC method such that P is nontrivial and consistent for `. Let (X, d) be a metric space such that, for TD(X, d) = \u03b8, \u03b8(\u03b5) = {B1, B2}, `d(B1, B2) = R > \u03b5 and {B1, B2} does not satisfy P for R. Suppose that #(X) is the minimal cardinal for which there exists such a metric space. Then, for any metric space (X \u2032, d\u2032) with #(X \u2032) < #(X), if TD(X\n\u2032, d\u2032) = \u03b8\u2032 and \u03b8\u2032(\u03b5\u2032) = {B\u20321, B\u20322} with `d\u2032(B\u20321, B\u20322) = R\u2032, then {B\u20321, B\u20322} satisfies P for R\u2032.\nProof. Since #(X) is minimal, if R\u2032 > \u03b5 we are done. Let R\u2032 \u2264 \u03b5. Suppose that {B\u20321, B\u20322} does not satisfy P for R\u2032 and suppose that #(X \u2032) is also minimal so that there is a pair of blocks which do not satisfy P . By the properties of linkage functions, there is a metric d\u2032\u2032 such that it extends d\u2032 on B\u20321 and B \u2032 2 and such that `d\u2032\u2032(B \u2032 1, B \u2032 2) = R\n\u2032\u2032 > \u03b5\u2032. Since #(X \u2032) is minimal, P does not apply in the construction of the dendrogram \u03b8\u2032(t) for t \u2264 \u03b5. Therefore, if TD(X\n\u2032, d\u2032\u2032) = \u03b8\u2032\u2032, then by Lemma 5.12, \u03b8\u2032\u2032(\u03b5\u2032) = {B\u20321, B\u20322}. Now, since P is consistent for `, {B\u20321, B\u20322} does not satisfy P for R\u2032\u2032 > \u03b5\u2032 which contradicts the minimality of #(X).\nDefinition 5.15. We say that an almost-standard linkage-based HC method T(`;P ) is admissible if the following conditions hold:\n\u2022 ` is \u0393-regular and scale preserving, \u2022 P is nontrivial and consistent for `, \u2022 TU (I(R)) = I(R).\nRemark 5.16. Let T(`;P ) be an almost-standard linkage-based HC method such that ` is `SL, `CL or `AL. Then, by 5.8 and 5.10, T is admissible if P is nontrivial and consistent for ` and TU (I(R)) = I(R).\nProposition 5.17. Let T = T(`;P ) be any admissible almost-standard linkagebased HC method. Then, there are constants \u03b5,R \u2208 R such that for every \u03b4 > 0 there exists a pair metric spaces (Z, d), (Z \u2032, d\u2032) holding the following conditions:\n\u2022 \u03b8(\u03b5) = {C1, C2}, where \u03b8 = TD(Z, d), \u2022 \u03b8\u2032(\u03b5) = {C \u20321, C \u20322}, where \u03b8\u2032 = TD(Z \u2032, d\u2032), \u2022 `(C1, C2) = `(C \u20321, C \u20322) = R > \u03b5 \u2022 dGH((Z, d), (Z \u2032, d\u2032)) < \u03b4, \u2022 {C1, C2} does not satisfy P for R i.e. C1 6\u223cR C2 \u2022 {C \u20321, C \u20322} satisfies P for R i.e. C \u20321 \u223cR C \u20322\nProof. Since condition P is nontrivial for `, there exists some metric space (X, d0) such that, for TD(X, d0) = \u03b80, \u03b80(\u03b5) = {B1, B2}, `(B1, B2) = R > \u03b5 and {B1, B2} does not satisfy P for R. Suppose that, given P , #(X) is the minimal cardinal for which there exists a metric space holding these conditions.\nLet \u0393 := \u0393B1,B2R : [0, 1]\u2192M be defined as in (3). As we proved in Proposition 5.6, \u0393 is a path in M. Now, let us see that \u0393 is a path in H(T, \u03b5) from (X, d0) to I(R). Since ` is \u0393-regular, `R,dt(B1, B2) = R > \u03b5. Let us see that \u03b8t(\u03b5) = {B1, B2} for every t \u2208 (0, 1). First, notice that since #(X) is minimal, by Lemma 5.14, if we apply the algo-\nrithm on X with any metric, every pair of blocks satisfies P as long as the pair of blocks involved do not include all the points in X.\nLet (X, d\u2032) := (X, (1\u2212 t)d0). Since ` is scale preserving, \u03b8\u2032((1\u2212 t)r) = \u03b8(r) where \u03b8\u2032 = TD(X, d\n\u2032). In particular, \u03b8\u2032((1\u2212 t)\u03b5) = {B1, B2}. Then, let us see that \u03b8t(r) = \u03b8\n\u2032(r) for every r \u2264 (1\u2212 t)\u03b5 where \u03b8Xt = TD(X, dt). Let \u0398i denote the partitions defined in the construction of \u03b8t and \u0398 \u2032 i denote the partitions defined in the construction of \u03b8\u2032. Clearly, \u03980 = \u0398 \u2032 0. Suppose \u0398i\u22121 = \u0398\u2032i\u22121 = {V1, ..., Vn} with V1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Vk = B1 and Vk+1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Vn = B2. Let R\u2032i\u22121 := min{`d\u2032(V, V \u2032) |V, V \u2032 \u2208 \u0398\u2032i, V 6= V \u2032} and assume R\u2032i\u22121 \u2264 (1\u2212 t)\u03b5. Notice that since \u03b8\u2032((1\u2212 t)\u03b5) = {B1, B2}, if `d\u2032(V, V \u2032) = R\u2032i\u22121, then V, V \u2032 are in the same block, B1 or B2. Now, since ` is monotonic (by definition), `dt(V, V \u2032) = `d\u2032(V, V \u2032) if V, V \u2032 are in the same block, B1 or B2, and `dt(V, V \u2032) \u2265 `d\u2032(V, V \u2032) if V \u2282 B1 and V \u2032 \u2282 B2. Therefore, Ri\u22121 = R \u2032 i\u22121 and \u0398i = \u0398 \u2032 i. Hence, it follows that \u03b8t(r) = \u03b8\n\u2032(r) for every r \u2264 (1\u2212 t)\u03b5. In particular, \u03b8t((1\u2212 t)\u03b5) = {B1, B2}.\nThus, since `R,dt(B1, B2) = R > \u03b5, \u03b8t(\u03b5) = {B1, B2} for every t \u2208 (0, 1). Since T is admissible, if TD(IR) = \u03b81, \u03b81(t) has two blocks {p\u03040}, {p\u03041} for every t < R. Then, \u0393(t) \u2208 H(T, \u03b5) for every t \u2208 [0, 1]. Since \u0393 is a path inH(T, \u03b5), for every \u03b3 there exist s1, s2 \u2208 [0, 1] with |s2\u2212s1| < \u03b3 such that \u03b3(s1) = (X, ds1) has two blocks C1 := B1, C2 := B2 with C1 6\u223cR C2 and \u0393(s2) = (X, ds2) has two blocks C \u2032 1 := B1, C \u2032 2 := B2 with C \u2032 1 \u223cR C \u20322.\nFinally, as we saw in the proof of Proposition 5.6, taking \u03b3 < 2\u03b4diam(X,d)+R ,\ndGH((X, ds1), (X, ds2)) < \u03b4.\nDefinition 5.18. We say that a pair of t-components B1, B2 in (X, d) are (t, R)bridged by a single edge if there exist b1 \u2208 B1, b2 \u2208 B2 such that d(b1, b2) = R > t and for every (b1, b2) 6= (x, y) \u2208 B1 \u00d7 B2, d(x, y) > R. If the constants t, R are not relevant we say that B1, B2 are bridged by a single edge.\nDefinition 5.19. Given T(`SL, P ), we say that P is bridge-unchaining if there is a metric space (X, d) and a nontrivial partition B1, B2 such that B1, B2 are bridged by a single edge and {B1, B2} does not satisfy {P} for R.\nDefinition 5.20. Given T(`SL, P ), we say that P is minimally bridge-unchaining if:\n\u2022 there is a metric space (X, d) and a nontrivial partition B1, B2 such that B1, B2 are bridged by a single edge and {B1, B2} does not satisfy {P} for R, \u2022 (X, d) can be chosen so that for every metric space X \u2032 with #(X \u2032) < #(X)\nand any nontrivial partition B\u20321, B \u2032 2 of X \u2032 with `SL(B1, B2) = \u03b5, then {B\u20321, B\u20322} satisfies {P} for \u03b5.\nProposition 5.21. For every \u03b1 \u2265 1, P\u03b1 (the unchaining condition of SL(\u03b1)) is minimally bridge-unchaining.\nProof. Consider X = B1\u222aB2 as follows. Let B1 := {x0, ..., x\u03b1+1} with d(xi, xj) = 1 for every i 6= j and let B2 := {y0, ..., y\u03b1+1} with d(yi, yj) = 1 for every i 6= j. Suppose d(x0, y0) = 2 and d(xi, yj) > 2 for every (i, j) 6= (0, 0).\nIt is immediate to check that B1, B2 are (1, 2)-bridged by a single edge which is (x0, y0).\nNow, F2(X) has a unique simplex, \u2206 = [x0, y0], intersecting B1 and B2 and dim(\u2206) = 1. Nevertheless, dim(F2(B1)) = dim(F2(B2)) = \u03b1 + 1. Therefore, B1, B2 does not satisfy P\u03b1 for 2.\nNotice that #(X) = 2\u03b1 + 4. Suppose X \u2032 = B\u20321 \u222a B\u20322 such that B\u20321, B\u20322 does not satisfy P\u03b1 for some R. Then, in particular, min{dim(FR(B1)), dim(FR(B2))} > \u03b1. Hence, #(B1),#(B2) > \u03b1 + 1 and #(X\n\u2032) \u2265 #(X). Thus, P\u03b1 is minimally bridge unchaining.\nDefinition 5.22. We say that a HC method T(`;P ) is ordinary if TU (I(R)) = I(R), TU (I(\u03b4,R)) = T SL U (I(\u03b4,R)) and TU (I(\u03b4,R, \u03b4)) = T SL U (I(\u03b4,R, \u03b4)) for every \u03b4,R > 0.\nRemark 5.23. For every \u03b1 \u2265 1, SL(\u03b1) is ordinary.\nTheorem 5.24. If T(`SL;P ) is an ordinary almost-standard linkage-based HC method and P is minimally bridge-unchaining, then T is not stable in the GromovHausdorff sense.\nProof. Since P is bridge-unchaining, there exists some metric space (X, d) with two \u03b5-components B1, B2 bridged by a single edge (b1, b2) with b1 \u2208 B1, b2 \u2208 B2, d(b1, b2) = R > \u03b5 and such that {B1, B2} does not satisfy P for R. Suppose that #(X) is the minimal cardinal for which there is such a pair.\nLet R = ti for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Then \u03b5 \u2264 ti\u22121, B1, B2 \u2208 \u03b8(ti\u22121) and B1 6\u223cR B2. Since T is ordinary, either B1 or B2 has at least two points. Let us assume that #(B1) > 1. Let \u03b4 = min1\u2264i\u2264n{ti \u2212 ti\u22121} (in particular, \u03b4 \u2264 t1 = minx6=x\u2032d(x, x\u2032)). If #(B2) = 1, let \u0393: [0, 1] \u2192 (M, dGH) be such that \u0393(0) = (X, d), \u0393(1) = I(\u03b4,R) and for every t \u2208 (0, 1), \u0393(t) = (X, dt) with\ndt(x, y) =  (1\u2212 t)d(x, y) if x, y \u2208 B1\\{b1} (1\u2212 t)d(x, y) + t\u03b4 if x = b1, y \u2208 B1\\{b1} or y = b1, x \u2208 B1\\{b1} (1\u2212 t)d(x, y) + t(R+ \u03b4) if x \u2208 B1\\{b1}, y = b2 or y \u2208 B1\\{b1}, x = b2 R if x = b1, y = b2 or y = b1, x = b2 If #(B2) > 1, let \u0393: [0, 1] \u2192 (M, dGH) be such that \u0393(0) = (X, d), \u0393(1) =\nI(\u03b4,R, \u03b4) and for every t \u2208 (0, 1), \u0393(t) = (X, dt) with dt(x, y) =\n22 A.

It suffices to check that the triangle inequality holds for every t \u2208 [0, 1).\nFirst, notice that given x, y, z \u2208 X, since d is a metric, for every 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1,\n(1\u2212 t)d(x, z) \u2264 (1\u2212 t)d(x, y) + (1\u2212 t)d(y, z).\nConsider the following cases:\n\u2022 If x, z are in the same t-component Bi. Then, if bi 6\u2208 {x, z}, dt(x, z) = (1 \u2212 t)d(x, z) \u2264 (1 \u2212 t)d(x, y) + (1 \u2212\nt)d(y, z) \u2264 dt(x, y) + dt(y, z). If bi \u2208 {x, z}, dt(x, z) = (1\u2212t)d(x, z)+t\u03b4 \u2264 (1\u2212t)d(x, y)+(1\u2212t)d(y, z)+\nt\u03b4 = dt(x, y) + dt(y, z). \u2022 If x, z are not in the same t-component.\nThen, if {x, z} = {b1, b2}, dt(x, z) = (1\u2212 t)d(x, z)+ tR \u2264 (1\u2212 t)d(x, y)+ (1\u2212 t)d(y, z) + tR < dt(x, y) + dt(y, z).\nIf {x, z} \u2229 {b1, b2} = bi, i = 1, 2, dt(x, z) = (1 \u2212 t)d(x, z) + tR + t\u03b4 \u2264 (1\u2212 t)d(x, y) + (1\u2212 t)d(y, z) + tR+ t\u03b4 \u2264 dt(x, y) + dt(y, z).\nIf {x, z}\u2229{b1, b2} = \u2205 dt(x, z) = (1\u2212t)d(x, z)+tR+2t\u03b4 \u2264 (1\u2212t)d(x, y)+ (1\u2212 t)d(y, z) + tR+ 2t\u03b4 \u2264 dt(x, y) + dt(y, z).\nClaim 1. \u0393 is a path in (M, dGH) from (X, d) to I(\u03b4,R) or I(\u03b4,R, \u03b4) respectively. Consider for every t1 < t2 < 1 the correspondence induced by the identity, \u03c4 = {(x, x) |x \u2208 X}. Then, for every pair of points x, y \u2208 X, |dt1(x, y)\u2212dt2(x, y)| \u2264 (t2 \u2212 t1)[d(x, y) +R+ 2\u03b4]. Hence, \u0393 is continuous on [0, 1).\nTo check the continuity at t = 1, consider the correspondence \u03c4 \u2032 given by (B1\\{b1}, p\u03040) , (b1, p\u03041), and (b2, p\u0304r) if #(B2) = 1 or (B1\\{b1}, p\u03040), (b1, p\u03041), (p2, p\u03042) and (B2\\{b2}, p\u03043) if #(B2) > 1.\nThen, given (x, a), (y, b) \u2208 \u03c4 \u2032, in every case |dt(x, y)\u2212d1(a, b)| \u2264 (1\u2212 t)[d(x, y)+ R+ 2\u03b4] and \u0393 is continuous.\nClaim 2. In either case, \u0393(t) \u2208 H(T, \u03b5) for every t \u2208 [0, 1]. We assumed that #(X) is the minimal cardinal for which there is a pair of blocks bridged by a single edge which does not satisfy P . Since P is minimally bridge-unchaining, this implies that #(X) is the minimal cardinal for which there is a pair of blocks which does not satisfy P . Hence, we may assume that P is always satisfied as long as the blocks involved are not a partition of X. T = TSL.\nNotice that this is the unique step where we need the assumption of being minimally bridge unchaining. Therefore, this theorem can be rewritten asking P to be bridge unchaining and any other condition that allows us to assume that condition P is satisfied in the construction of the dendrogram for every Ri \u2264 \u03b5.\nAlso, since \u03b4 \u2264 t1, it is immediate to check that for every t \u2208 (0, 1), dt(x, y) \u2264 d(x, y) for every x, y \u2208 Br with r = 1, 2. Thus, B1, B2 are \u03b5-connected in (X, dt). Then, if TD(X, dt) = \u03b8t, and P is always satisfied for every t \u2264 \u03b5, \u03b8t(\u03b5) = {B1, B2}.\nClaim 3. For every t \u2208 [0, 1) there is no pair of points x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2 with R < dt(x, y) < R + \u03b4. Notice that if R = ti, ti+1 \u2265 R + \u03b4 and for every x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2, then either x = c1 and y = c2 with dt(x, y) = R, or d(x, y) \u2265 ti+1 \u2265 R+ \u03b4 and dt(x, y) \u2265 (1\u2212 t)d(x, y) + t(R+ \u03b4) \u2265 R+ \u03b4.\nSince T(`SL;P ) is an ordinary HC method, T(I(\u03b4,R)) = TSL(I(\u03b4,R)) and T(I(\u03b4,R, \u03b4)) = TSL(I(\u03b4,R, \u03b4)). Since #(X) is the minimal cardinal for which condition P has an effect, \u03b8t(\u03b5) = {B1, B2} for every t \u2208 [0, 1). Since \u0393 is continuous, for any \u03b41 > 0 there exist s1, s2 \u2208 [0, 1] with |s2 \u2212 s1| < \u03b41 such that \u0393(s1) = (X, ds1) has two \u03b5-components B1, B2 with B1 6\u223cR B2 and \u0393(s2) = (X, ds2) has two \u03b5components B\u20321, B \u2032 2 with B \u2032 1 \u223cR B\u20322. If s2 < 1 let B\u20321 := B1 and B\u20322 := B2. If s2 = 1 and \u0393(1) = I(\u03b4,R) let B \u2032 1 := {p\u03040, p\u03041} and B\u20322 := {p\u03042}. If s2 = 1 and \u0393(1) = I(\u03b4,R, \u03b4) let B\u20321 := {p\u03040, p\u03041} and B\u20322 := {p\u03042, p\u03043}. Let T((X, ds1)) = (X,us1) and T((X, ds2)) = (X,us2). For every x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2, us2(x, y) = R and, since ds(x, y) 6\u2208 (R,R+ \u03b4) for any s \u2208 [0, 1], us1(x, y) \u2265 R+ \u03b4. Claim 4. dGH((X,us1), (X,us2)) \u2265 \u03b42 . Suppose there is a correspondence \u03c4 \u2282 X \u00d7X such that\n(4) sup (x,y),(x\u2032,y\u2032)\u2208\u03c4\n|us1(x, x\u2032)\u2212 us2(y, y\u2032)| < \u03b4.\nFirst, let us check that if (x, y), (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 and x, x\u2032 are in the same \u03b5-component of (X, d), then y, y\u2032 are also in the same \u03b5-component of (X, d). Let x = x0, ..., xn =\nx\u2032 be a \u03b5-chain in (X, d). Then, it is a \u03b5-chain in (X, ds1) and, since #(C1) < #(X), condition P does not apply. Hence (B1 is a block in \u03b8s1(\u03b5) and) us1(x, x\n\u2032) \u2264 \u03b5 = ti\u22121. If y, y \u2032 are not in the same \u03b5-component, then us1SL(y, y \u2032), us2SL(y, y\n\u2032) \u2265 R = ti. Therefore, |us1(x, x\u2032)\u2212 us2(y, y\u2032)| \u2265 ti \u2212 ti\u22121 \u2265 \u03b4 which contradicts (4).\nLet (b1, y)(b2, y \u2032) \u2208 \u03c4 . Let us recall that |us1(c1, c2)| = R and |us2(y, y\u2032)| \u2265 R+\u03b4 since y, y\u2032 are in different \u03b5-components. Hence, |us1(b1, b2)\u2212 us2(y, y\u2032)| \u2265 \u03b4 which contradicts (4).\nHence, sup(x,y),(x\u2032,y\u2032)\u2208\u03c4 |us1(x, x\u2032) \u2212 us2(y, y\u2032)| \u2265 \u03b4 for every correspondence \u03c4 , this is, dGH((X,us1), (X,us2)) \u2265 \u03b42 . Since \u0393 is continuous and s2\u2212 s1 is arbitrarily small, then dGH((X, dt1), (X, dt2)) is also arbitrarily small. Therefore, T is not stable.\nFrom Proposition 5.21 and Theorem 5.24,\nCorollary 5.25. SL(\u03b1) is not stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\n6. Discussion\nUsing some kind of metric between metric spaces and how the distance between the input determines the distance between the output is a natural way of measuring stability. One of the advantages of using Gromov-Hausdorff metric is that it allows us to measure the distance between metric spaces which do not have the same number of points and this is necessary to check the stability of a method when the input has no fixed number of points. However, we prove that if the input does not correspond to an ultrametric space, Gromov-Hausdorff stability is a rare property.\nAmong the typical linkage-based methods, only single linkage is stable. If we introduce an unchaining property, then we may say that surely the method is going to be unstable.\nWe believe that almost-standard linkage-based algorithms can be used to treat different problems related with the chaining effect. Stability is, of course, a strongly desirable property for the method. From our results, we conclude that GromovHausdorff metric is not the appropriate metric to measure the stability of an almoststandard linkage-based algorithm. Other possible metrics will be analyzed in future research.\nReferences\n[1] M. Ackerman, S. Ben-David and D. Loker. Characterization of Linkage-based Clustering.\n[2] M. Ackerman and S. Ben-David.
