INTRODUCTION", "text": "Novelty detection is the identification of new or unknown data that is not labeled during training [1]. In the traditional setting, only training examples from a nominal distribution are provided and the goal is to determine for a new example whether it comes from the nominal distribution or not. Much work has been done in this field. Early work is generally divided into two categories [1, 2]. One category includes statistical approaches such as some density estimation methods. The other category consists of neural network based approaches, e.g., multi-layer perceptrons. Several new approaches have been introduced in recent years. In [3], geo-\nThis work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation grant CCF-1254218.\nmetric entropy minimization is introduced for anomaly detection. An efficient anomaly detection method using bipartite k-NN graphs is presented in [4]. In [5], an anomaly detection algorithm is proposed based on score functions. Each point gets scores from its nearest neighbors. This algorithm can be directly applied to novelty detection. In [6], SVMs are applied to novelty detection to learn a function f that is positive on a subset S of the input space and negative outside S.\nIn this paper, we consider novelty detection in a new setting where the data follows a multi-instance multi-label (MIML) format. The MIML framework has been primarily studied for supervised learning [7] and widely used in applications where data is associated with multiple classes and can be naturally represented as bags of instances (i.e., collections of parts). For example, a document can be viewed as a bag of words and associated with multiple tags. Similarly, an image can be represented as a bag of pixels or patches, and associated with multiple classes corresponding to the objects that it contains. Formally speaking, the training data in MIML consists of a collection of labeled bags {(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . . , (XN , YN )}, where Xi \u2282 X is a set of instances and Yi \u2282 Y is a set of labels. In the traditional MIML applications the goal is to learn a bag-level classifier f : 2X \u2192 2Y that can reliably predict the label set of a previously unseen bag.\nIt is commonly assumed in MIML that every instance we observe in the training set belongs to one of the known classes. However, in many applications, this assumption is violated. For example, in a collection of tagged images, the tag may only cover a subset of objects present in the images. The goal of novelty detection in the MIML setting is to determine whether a given instance comes from an unknown class given only a set of bags labeled with the known classes. This setup has several advantages compared to the more wellknown setup in novelty detection: First, the labeled bags allow us to apply an approach that takes into account the presence of multiple known classes. Second, frequently the training set would contain some novel class instances. The presence of such instances, although never explicitly labeled as novel instances, can in a way serve as \u201cimplicit\u201d negative examples for the known classes, which can be helpful for identifying novel instances in new bags.\n978-1-4799-1180-6/13/$31.00 c\u00a92013 IEEE\nThe work presented in this paper is inspired by a real world bioacoustics application. In this application, the annotation of individual bird vocalization is often a time consuming task. As an alternative, experts identify from a list of focal bird species the ones that they recognize in a given recording. Such labels are associated with the entire recording and not with a specific vocalization in the recording. Based on a collection of such labeled recordings, the goal is to annotate each vocalization in a new recording [8]. An implicit assumption here is that each vocalization in the recording must come from one of the focal species, which can be incomplete. Under this assumption, vocalizations of new species outside of the focal list will not be discovered. Instead, such vocalizations will be annotated with a label from the existing species list. The setup proposed in this paper allows for novel instances to be observed in the training data without being explicitly labeled, and hence should enable the annotation of vocalizations from novel species. In turn, such novel instances can be presented back to the experts for further inspection.\nTo the best of our knowledge, novelty detection in the MIML setting has not been investigated. Our main contributions are: (i) We propose a new problem \u2013 novelty detection in the MIML setting. (ii) We offer a framework based on score functions to solve the problem. (iii) We illustrate the efficacy of our method on a real-world MIML bioacoustics data."}, {"heading": "2. PROPOSED METHODS", "text": "Suppose we are given a collection of labeled bags {(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . . , (XN , YN )}, where the ith bag Xi \u2282 X is a set of instances from the feature space X \u2282 Rd, and Yi is a subset of the know label set Y = \u22c3N i=1 Yi. For any label yim \u2208 Yi, there is at least one instance xin \u2208 Xi belonging to this class. We consider the scenario where an instance in Xi has no label in Yi related to it, which extends the traditional MIML learning framework. Our goal is to determine for a given instance x \u2208 X whether it belongs to a known class in Y or not.\nTo illustrate the intuition behind our general strategy, consider the toy problem shown in Table 1. The known label set is {I,II}. We have four labeled bags available. According to the principle that one instance must belong to one class and one bag-level label must have at least one corresponding instance, we conclude that \u25b3 is drawn from class I, belongs to class II, and \u2666 doesn\u2019t come from the existing classes. \u25bd cannot be fully determined based on current data.\nTo express this observation mathematically, we calculate the rate of co-occurrence of an instance and a label. For example, \u25b3 appears with label I together in bag 1, 2, 4 and they are both missing in bag 3. So, the co-occurrence rate p(\u25b3, I) = 1. All the other rates are listed in Table 2. If we detect an instance based on the maximal co-occurrence rate with respect to all classes and set a threshold to be 3/4, we will reach a result that can generally reflect our previous observation.\nThis example inspires us to devise a general strategy for detection. We introduce a set of score functions, each of which corresponds to one class, i.e., for each label c \u2208 Y , we assign a function fc to class c. Generally, for an instance from a specific known class, the value of the score function corresponding to this class should be large. If all scores of an instance are below a prescribed threshold, it would not be considered to belong to any known class. The decision principle is: If maxc\u2208{1,...,|Y |} fc(x) < \u03b5 then return \u2018unknown\u2019, otherwise return \u2018known\u2019.\nThere are many possible choices for the set of score functions. Generally, the score functions are expected to enable us to achieve a high true positive rate with a given false positive (Type I error) rate, which can be measured by the area under the curve (AUC) of ROC."}, {"heading": "2.1. Kernel Based Scoring Functions", "text": "We define the score function for class c as follows:\nfc(x) = \u2211\nxl\u2208 \u22c3\ni\nXi\n\u03b1clk(x, xl)\n= \u03b1Tc k(x)\n(1)\nwhere Xi\u2019s are training bags, xl\u2019s are training instances from training bags, k(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the kernel function such that k(x) = (k(x, x1), . . . , k(x, xL))\nT, and \u03b1cl\u2019s are the components of the weight vector \u03b1c = (\u03b1c1, . . . , \u03b1cL)T.\nWe encourage fc to take positive values on instances in class c and negative values on instances from other classes. Hence, we define the objective function OBJ as\n\u03bb\n2\n|Y |\u2211\nc=1\n\u03b1Tc K\u03b1c + 1\nN |Y |\nN\u2211\ni=1\n|Y |\u2211\nc=1\nFc(Xi) (2)\nwhere\nFc(Xi) = max{0, 1\u2212 yic max xij\u2208Xi fc(xij)}, yic \u2208 {\u22121,+1}\n\u03bb is a regularization parameter, K is the kernel matrix with (i, j)-th entry k(xi, xj), xi, xj \u2208 \u22c3 k Xk, and yic = +1 if and only if Yi contains the label for class c. In fact, we define an objective function for each class separately and sum over all these objective functions to construct OBJ . The first term of OBJ controls model complexity. Fc(\u00b7) in the second term of OBJ can be viewed as a baglevel hinge loss for class c, which is a generalization of the single-instance case. If c is a bag-level label of bag Xi, we expect max\nxij\u2208Xi fc(xij) to give a high score because there is at\nleast one instance in Xi is from class c. Other loss functions such as rank loss [8] have already been introduced for MIML learning.\nOur goal is to minimize the objective function which is unfortunately non-convex. However, if we fix the term max\nxij\u2208Xi fc(xij), i.e., find the support instance xic such that xic = argmaxxij\u2208Xi \u03b1c Tk(xij) and substitute back to the objective function, the resulted objective function OBJ \u2217 will be convex with respect to \u03b1c\u2019s. To solve this convex problem, we deploy the L-BFGS [9] algorithm. The subgradient along \u03b1c used in L-BFGS is computed as follows:\n\u2207c = \u03bbK\u03b1c \u2212 1\nN |Y |\nN\u2211\ni=1\nyick(xic)1{1\u2212yicfc(xic)>0} (3)\nDetails can be found in Algorithm 1. This descent method can be applied to any choice of kernel function and according to our experience it works very well (usually converges within 30 steps). Note that many algorithms [8,10] for MIML learning that attempt to learn an instance-level score functions including the proposed approach are based on a non-convex objective. Consequently, no global optimum is guaranteed. To reduce the effect induced by randomness, we usually rerun the algorithm multiple times with independent random initializations and adopt the result with the smallest value of the objective function.\nAlgorithm 1 Descent Method Require: {(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . . , (XN , YN )}, \u03bb, T .\nRandomly initialize all \u03b1c\u2019s s.t. \u2016\u03b11c\u2016 = 1 for t = 1 to T do\nSet xtic = argmaxxij\u2208Xi (\u03b1 t c) T k(xij),\n1 t ic = 1{1\u2212yicfc(xtic)>0},\n\u2207tc = \u03bbK\u03b1c \u2212 1\nN |Y | N\u2211 i=1 yick(x t ic)1 t ic.\nPlug {xtic} into OBJ to get a convex surrogate OBJ t \u2217.

The parameter \u03b3 controls the bandwidth of the kernel.

Two processes for generating bags are listed in Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3. The only difference between these two procedures is that Algorithm 3 rules out the possibility of a label set for a bag being empty, i.e., a bag including purely novel examples. For Dirichlet process used in our simulation, we assigned relatively small concentration parameters \u03b2 = (\u03b21, \u03b22, . . . , \u03b210) to the Dirichlet distribution in order to encourage a sparse label set for a bag, which is common in real-world scenarios.

Two typical examples of ROCs from the two setting are shown in Figure 1.\nTable 5 shows the average AUCs of ROCs over multiple runs from the first setting. We observe that average AUCs are all above 0.85 for the known label sets of size 4. For the known label sets of size 8, the average AUCs are all larger than 0.8. The results are fairly stable with different combinations of labels. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm.\nTable 6 shows the average AUCs of ROCs for the setting which does not contain bags with an empty label set. The label sets in these two tables are the same. The results in the two tables are comparable but those in Table 5 are always better. This demonstrates that it is beneficial to include bags with an empty label set.

HJA Birdsong Dataset", "text": "We tested our algorithm on the real-world dataset - HJA birdsong dataset2, which has been used in [11, 12].

Species names and the numbers of instances for those species are listed in Table 7. Each species corresponds to a class in the complete label set {1, 2, . . . , 13}. We took a subset of the complete label set as the known label set and conducted experiment with various choices of the known label set. Table 8 shows the average AUCs of different known label sets. Specifically, we intentionally made each species appear at least once in those known sets. From Table 8, we observe that most all of the values of AUCs are above 0.85 and some even reach 0.9. The results are quite stable with different label settings despite the imbalance in the instance population of the species.

Comparison with One-Class SVM", "text": "Our algorithm deals with detection problem with MIML setting, which is different from the traditional setting for anomaly detection. We argue that traditional anomaly detection algorithms cannot be directly applied to our problem.

To apply one-class SVM, we construct a normal class training data consisting of examples from the known label set. The parameter \u03bd vary from 0 to 1 with step size 0.02 to generate ROCs. The Gaussian kernel is used for one-class SVM. We search the parameter \u03b3 for the kernel in a wide range and select the best one for on-class SMV post-hoc. We present this unfair advantage to one-class SVM for two reasons: (i) It is unclear how to optimize the parameter in the absence of novel instances. (ii) We would like to illustrate the point that even given such unfair advantage, one-class SVM cannot outperform our algorithm.\nTable 9 and 10 show the average AUCs for handwritten digits data and birdsong data respectively.

This paper studies novelty detection in a new setting where the data object is represented as a bag of instances and associated with multiple class labels, referred to as multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning. Contrary to the common assumption in MIML that each instance in a bag belongs to one of the known classes, in novelty detection, we focus on the scenario where bags may contain novel-class instances. The goal is to determine, for any given instance in a new bag, whether it belongs to a known class or a novel class. Detecting novelty in the MIML setting captures many realworld phenomena and has many potential applications. For example, in a collection of tagged images, the tag may only cover a subset of objects existing in the images. Discovering an object whose class has not been previously tagged can be useful for the purpose of soliciting a label for the new object class. To address this novel problem, we present a discriminative framework for detecting new class instances. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and reveal that the presence of unlabeled novel instances in training bags is helpful to the detection of such instances in testing stage.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
