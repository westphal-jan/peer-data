Introduction", "text": "Rough set theory [17], based on equivalence relations, was proposed by Pawlak to deal with the vagueness and incompleteness of knowledge in information systems. It has been widely applied to many practical applications in various areas, such as attribute reductions [14, 13, 30], rule extractions [3] and so on. In order to extend rough set theory\u2019s applications, some scholars have extended the theory to generalized rough set theory based on tolerance relation [15], similarity relation [19] and arbitrary binary relation [12, 37]. Through extending a partition to a covering, rough set theory has been generalized to covering-based rough set theory [33, 37]. Because of its high efficiency in many complicated problems such as knowledge reduction and rule learning\nEmail address: williamfengzhu@gmail.com (William Zhu)\nar X\niv :1\n31 2.\n42 32\nv2 [\ncs .A\nI] 4\nJ an\n2 01\nin incomplete information system, covering-based rough set theory has been attracting increasing research interest [18, 25, 27, 35, 36, 38, 22, 23].\nA lattice is suggested by the form of the Hasse diagram depicting it. In mathematics, a lattice is a partially ordered set in which any two elements have a unique supremum (also called a least upper bound or join) and a unique infimum (also called a greatest lower bound or meet). They encode the algebraic behavior of the entailment relation and such basic logical connectives as \u201cand\u201d (conjunction) and \u201cor\u201d(disjunction), which results in adequate algebraic semantics for a variety of logical systems. Lattices, especially geometric lattices, are important algebraic structures and are used extensively in both theoretical and applicable fields, such as rough sets [5, 7], formal concept analysis [24, 31, 32] and domain theory [1, 2].\nMatroid theory [9, 16] borrows extensively from linear algebra and graph theory. There are dozens of equivalent ways to characterize a matroid. Significant definitions of a matroid include those in terms of independent sets, bases, circuits, closed sets or flats and rank functions, which provides well-established platforms to connect with other theories. In applications, matroids have been widely used in many fields such as combinatorial optimization, network flows and algorithm design, especially greedy algorithm design [4, 10]. Studying rough sets with matroids is helpful to enrich the theory system and to extend the applications of rough sets. Some works on the connection between rough sets and matroids have been conducted [6, 8, 11, 21, 20, 29, 28, 26, 39, 40].\nIn this paper, we pay our attention to geometric lattice structures of coverings and their applications to attribute reduction issues of information systems. First, a geometric lattice of a covering is constructed through the transversal matroid induced by the covering. Then its atoms are studied and used to characterize the lattice structure. It is interesting that any element of the lattice can be expressed as the union of all closures of single-point sets in the element. Second, we apply the obtained geometric lattice to attribute reduction issues in information systems. It is interesting that a subset of a finite nonempty set is a reduct of the information system if and only if it is a minimal set with respect to the property of containing an element from each nonempty complement of any coatom of the lattice.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall some fundamental concepts related to rough sets, lattices and matroids. Section 3 presents a geometric lattice of a covering, and characterizes the structure by the atoms of the lattice. In Section 4, we apply the obtained geometric lattices to the attribute reduction issues of information systems. Finally, this paper is concluded and further work is pointed out in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we review some basic concepts of rough sets, matroids, and geometric lattices.\n2.1. Rough sets\nRough set theory is a new mathematical tool for imprecise and incomplete data analysis. It uses equivalence relations (resp.partitions) to describe the knowledge we\ncan master. In this subsection, we introduce some concepts of rough sets used in this paper.\nDefinition 1. (Covering and partition) Let U be a universe, C a family of subsets of U . If none of subsets in C are empty and \u22c3 C = U , then C is called a covering of U . The element of C is called a covering block. If P is a covering of U and it is a family of pairwise disjoint subsets of U , then P is called a partition of U .\nIt is clear that a partition is certainly a covering, so the concept of a covering is an extension of the concept of a partition.\nDefinition 2. (Approximation operators [17]) Let U be a finite set andR be an equivalent relation (reflexive, symmetric and transitive) on U . \u2200X \u2286 U , the lower and upper approximations of X , are, respectively, defined as follows:\nR\u2217(X) = {x \u2208 U : [x]R \u2286 X}, R\u2217(X) = {x \u2208 U : [x]R \u22c2 X 6= \u2205},\nwhere [x]R is called the equivalence class of x with respect to R.\n2.2. Matroids Matroid theory borrows extensively from the terminology of linear algebra and graph theory, largely because it is the abstraction of various notions of central importance in these fields, such as independent sets, bases and the rank function.\nDefinition 3. (Matroid [16]) A matroid is an ordered pair (U, I) consisting of a finite set U and a collection I of subsets of U satisfying the following three conditions: (I1) \u2205 \u2208 I. (I2) If I \u2208 I and I \u2032 \u2286 I , then I \u2032 \u2208 I. (I3) If I1, I2 \u2208 I and |I1| < |I2|, then there is an element e \u2208 I2 \u2212 I1 such that I1 \u22c3 {e} \u2208 I, where |X| denotes the cardinality of X .\nLet M = (U, I) be a matroid. The members of I are the independent sets of M . A set in I is maximal, in the sense of inclusion, is called a base of M . If X /\u2208 I, X is called a dependent set of M . In the sense of inclusion, a minimal dependent subset of U is called a circuit of M . The collections of the bases and the circuits of matroid M are denoted by B(M) and C(M), respectively. The rank function of matroid M is a function rM : 2U \u2192 N defined by rM (X) = max{|I| : I \u2286 X, I \u2208 I}, where X \u2286 U . For each X \u2286 U , we say clM (X) = {a \u2208 U : rM (X) = rM (X \u22c3 {a})} is the closure of X in M . If clM (X) = X , X is called a closed set of M . For any X \u2286 U , if clM (X) = X and rM (X) = rM (U)\u2212 1, then X is called a hyperplane in M . The rank function of a matroid, directly analogous to a similar theorem of linear algebra, has the following proposition.\nProposition 1. (Rank axiom [16]) Let U be a set. A function r : 2U \u2192 N is the rank function of a matroid on U if and only if it satisfies the following conditions: (R1) For all X \u2286 U , 0 \u2264 r(X) \u2264 |X|. (R2) If X \u2286 Y \u2286 U , then r(X) \u2264 r(Y ). (R3) If X,Y \u2286 U , then r(X \u22c3 Y ) + r(X \u22c2 Y ) \u2264 r(X) + r(Y ).\nThe following proposition is the closure axiom of a matroid. It means that an operator satisfies the following four conditions if and only if it is the closure operator of a matroid.\nProposition 2. (Closure axiom [16]) Let U be a set. A function cl : 2U \u2192 2U is the closure operator of a matroid on U if and only if it satisfies the following conditions: (1) If X \u2286 U , then X \u2286 cl(X). (2) If X \u2286 Y \u2286 U , then cl(X) \u2286 cl(Y ). (3) If X \u2286 U , cl(cl(X)) = cl(X). (4) If X \u2286 U, x \u2208 U and y \u2208 cl(X \u22c3 {x})\u2212 cl(X), then x \u2208 cl(X \u22c3 {y}).\nTransversal theory is a branch of matroids. It shows how to induce a matroid, namely, transversal matroid from a family of subsets of a set. Hence, transversal matroids establish a bridge between a collection of subsets of a set and a matroid.\nDefinition 4. (Transversal [16]) Let S be a nonempty finite set and J = {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m}. F = {F1, F2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Fm} denotes a family of subsets of S. A transversal or system of distinct representatives of {F1, F2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Fm} is a subset {e1, e2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , em} of S such that ei \u2208 Fi for all i \u2208 J . If for a subset K of J , X is a transversal of {Fi : i \u2208 K}, then X is called a partial transversal of {F1, F2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Fm}.\nExample 1. Let S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, F1 = {1, 3}, F2 = {2, 3} and F3 = {3, 4}. For F = {F1, F2, F3}, T = {2, 3, 4} is a transversal of F because 2 \u2208 F2, 3 \u2208 F1 and 4 \u2208 F3. T \u2032 = {2, 4} is a partial transversal of F because there exists a subset of F , i.e., {F2, F3}, such that T \u2032 is a transversal of it.\nThe following proposition shows what kind of matroid is a transversal matroid.\nProposition 3. (Transversal matroid [16]) Let F = {Fi : i \u2208 J} be a family of subsets of U . M(F) = (U, I(F)) is a matroid, where I(F) is the family of all partial transversals of F . We call M(F) = (U, I(F)) the transversal matroid induced by F .\nExample 2. (Continued from Example 1) I(F) = {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4}}.\n2.3. Geometric lattice\nA lattice is a poset (L,\u2264) such that, for every pair of elements, the least upper bound and greatest lower bound of the pair exist. Formally, if x and y are arbitrary elements of L, then L contains elements x \u2228 y and x \u2227 y. The element a of L is an atom of lattice (L,\u2264) if it satisfies the condition: 0 < a and there is no x \u2208 L such that 0 < x < a. The element a of L is a coatom of lattice (L,\u2264) if it satisfies the condition: a < 1 and there is no x \u2208 L such that a < x < 1. The following lemma gives another definition of a geometric lattice from the viewpoint of matroids. In fact, the set of all closed sets of a matroid, ordered by inclusion, is a geometric lattice.\nProposition 4. [16] A lattice L is a geometric lattice if and only if it is the lattice of closed sets of a matroid.\nThe above proposition indicates that (L(M),\u2286) is a geometric lattice, whereL(M) denotes the collection of all closed sets of matroid M . The operations join and meet of the lattice are, respectively, defined as X \u2227 Y = X \u22c2 Y and X \u2228 Y = clM (X \u22c3 Y ) for all X,Y \u2208 L(M). Moreover, the height of any element of the lattice is equal to the rank of the element inM . As we know, the atoms of a lattice are precisely the elements of height one. Therefore, the collection of the atoms of the lattice is the family of the sets which are closed sets of matroid M and have value 1 as their ranks."}, {"heading": "3. Geometric lattice structure of covering through matroids", "text": "As we know, a collection of all the closed sets of a matroid, in the sense of inclusion, is a geometric lattice. In this section, we convert a covering to a matroid through transversal matroids, then study the lattice of all the closed sets of the matroid. By this way, we realize the purpose to construct a geometric lattice structure from a covering.\nLetU be a nonempty and finite set andF a collection of nonempty subsets ofU . As shown in Proposition 3, M(F) is the transversal matroid induced by F and we denote the geometric lattice of F by (L(M(F)),\u2286). When F is a covering C, the geometric lattice corresponding to it is denoted by (L(M(C)),\u2286). For convenience, we substitute x for {x} in the following discussion.\n3.1. Atoms of the geometric lattice structure induced by a covering\nAtoms of a geometric lattice are elements that are minimal among the non-zero elements and can be used to express the lattice. Therefore, atoms play an important role in the lattices. In this subsection, we study the atoms of the geometric lattice structure induced by a covering.\nA covering of universe of objects is the collection of some basic knowledge we master, therefore it is important to be studied in detail. The following theorem provides some equivalence characterizations for a covering from the viewpoint of matroids.\nLemma 1. [16] Let M be a matroid of U and X \u2286 U . rM (X) = rM (clM (X)).\nLemma 2. [16] Let M be a matroid of U and X,Y \u2286 U . If X \u2286 Y and rM (X) = rM (Y ), then clM (X) = clM (Y ).\nTheorem 1. Let F be a family of nonempty subsets of U and F 6= \u2205. The following statements are equivalent. (1): F is a covering of U . (2): clF (\u2205) = \u2205. (3): {clF (x) : x \u2208 U} is a partition of U . (4): {clF (x) : x \u2208 U} is the collection of the atoms of (L(M(F)),\u2286).\nPROOF. \u201c(1) \u21d2 (2)\u201d: According to the definition of transversal matroids, any partial transversal is an independent set. Since F is a covering, any single-point set is an independent set. Therefore, clM(F)(\u2205) = \u2205.\n\u201c(2) \u21d2 (4)\u201d: For all x \u2208 U , clM(F)(clM(F)(x)) = clM(F)(x), then clM(F)(x) \u2208 L(M(F)). Since clM(F)(\u2205) = \u2205, any single-point set is an independent set, that\nis, \u2200x \u2208 U , rM(F)(x) = 1. Utilizing Lemma 1, we have rM(F)(clM(F)(x)) = rM(F)(x) = 1. Thus, for all x \u2208 U , clM(F)(x) is an atom of the lattice (L(M(F)),\u2286). Conversely, if A is an atom of the lattice (L(M(F)),\u2286), then clM(F)(A) = A and rM(F)(A) = 1. It is clear that A 6= \u2205. Pitch x \u2208 A, then rM(F)(x) = 1 = rM(F)(A). Utilizing Lemma 2, we have clM(F)(x) = clM(F)(A) = A. Therefore, we have proved the result.\n\u201c(4) \u21d2 (3)\u201d: We firstly prove: \u2200x, y \u2208 U , if clM(F)(x) \u22c2 clM(F)(y) 6= \u2205, then\nclM(F)(x) = clM(F)(y). We may as well suppose z \u2208 clM(F)(x) \u22c2 clM(F)(y). Then clM(F)(\u2205) \u2286 clM(F)(z) \u2286 clM(F)(x) and clM(F)(\u2205) \u2286 clM(F)(z) \u2286 clM(F)(y). We conclude that clM(F)(\u2205) 6= clM(F)(z); Otherwise, rM(F)(clM(F)(z)) = rM(F)(clM(F)(\u2205)) = rM(F)(\u2205) = 0, which contradicts that clM(F)(z) is an atom. Thus clM(F)(\u2205) \u2282 clM(F)(z) \u2286 clM(F)(x) and clM(F)(\u2205) \u2282 clM(F)(z) \u2286 clM(F)(y). According to the definition of atoms, we have clM(F)(x) = clM(F)(z) = clM(F)(y). \u2200x \u2208 U , x \u2208 clM(F)(x), then clM(F)(x) 6= \u2205. Moreover, U = \u22c3 x\u2208U{x} \u2286 \u22c3 x\u2208U clM(F)(x) \u2286\u22c3\nx\u2208U U = U , that is, U = \u22c3\nx\u2208U clM(F)(x). Hence {clM(F)(x) : x \u2208 U} is a partition of U .\n\u201c(3)\u21d2 (1)\u201d: Since {clF (x) : x \u2208 U} is a partition of U , for any distinct elements clM(F)(u) and clM(F)(v) of {clM(F)(x) : x \u2208 U}, clM(F)(u) \u22c2 clM(F)(v) = \u2205. Thus clM(F)(\u2205) \u2286 clM(F)(u) and clM(F)(\u2205) \u2286 clM(F)(v). Hence clM(F)(\u2205) \u2286 clM(F)(u) \u22c2 clM(F)(v) = \u2205. Combining with \u2205 \u2286 clM(F)(\u2205), we have clM(F)(\u2205) = \u2205. Thus, for all x \u2208 U , x is an independent set, that is, there exists Fx \u2208 F such that x \u2208 Fx. Hence, U = \u22c3 x\u2208U{x} \u2286 \u22c3 x\u2208U Fx \u2286 \u22c3 F \u2286 U . Thus \u22c3 F = U . Since F is a family of nonempty subsets of U and F 6= \u2205, we know \u2205 /\u2208 F . Therefore, we have proved that F is a covering of U .\nTheorem 1 indicates that the closure of any single-point set is an atom of lattice L(M(C)). Based on the fact, we obtain all the atoms of the lattice from covering C directly.\nDefinition 5. [7] Let C = {K1,K2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Km} be a covering of a finite set U = {x1, x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xn}. We define (i) A = {Ki \u2212 \u22c3m j=1,j 6=iKj : Ki \u2212 \u22c3m j=1,j 6=iKj 6= \u2205, i \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m}} = {A1, A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , As}. (ii) B = U \u2212 \u22c3s i=1Ai.\nRemark 1. For all i \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s} and x \u2208 Ai, there exists only one block of covering C such that x belongs to it, and there exist at least two blocks of covering C such that y belongs to them for all y \u2208 B.\nOne example is provided to illustrate the above definition.\nExample 3. Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and C = {K1,K2,K3}, where K1 = {1, 3},K2 = {2, 3},K3 = {3, 4, 5}. Then K1 \u2212 K2 \u22c3 K3 = {1, 3} \u2212 {2, 3, 4, 5} = {1}, Similarly, K2 = {2} and K3 = {4, 5}. Therefore A = {{1}, {2}, {4, 5}} and B = U \u2212 \u22c3 A = U \u2212 {1, 2, 4, 5} = {3}.\nIn fact, the closure of any singleton set of universeU in matroidM(C) is an element of A or a single-point set of B. In order to reveal the fact better, we need the two lemmas below.\nLemma 3. Let C be a covering of U . For all x \u2208 U , there exists K \u2208 C such that clM(C)(x) \u2286 K.\nPROOF. For all x \u2208 U , we take K \u2208 C satisfies x \u2208 K, then clM(C)(x) \u2286 K. In fact, for all y /\u2208 K, there exists K \u2032 6= K such that y \u2208 K \u2032 because C is a covering of U . That implies that {x, y} is an independent set because there exist K,K \u2032 \u2208 C such that x \u2208 K and y \u2208 K \u2032 . Thus, rM(C)({x, y}) = 2 6= 1 = rM(C)(x) which implies that y /\u2208 clM(C)(x). Therefore, we prove the result.\nLemma 4. Let C be a covering of U . For all x \u2208 U , if |clM(C)(x)| \u2265 2, then there exists only one block K of C such that clM(C)(x) \u2286 K.\nPROOF. According to Lemma 3, we know there exists K \u2208 C such that clM(C)(x) \u2286 K for all x \u2208 U . Now, we need to prove the uniqueness of K. Suppose there exists the other block K \u2032 such that clM(C)(x) \u2286 K \u2032 . We claim that clM(C)(x) = {x}; otherwise, there exists y 6= x such that y \u2208 clM(C)(x) because we have had x \u2208 clM(C)(x). That implies that rM(F)({x, y}) = rM(C)(x) = 1. However, there exist two blocks K and K \u2032 such that clM(C)(x) is contained in them. Thus rM(C)({x, y}) = 2, which implies a contradiction! Hence clM(C)(x) = {x}, i.e., |clM(C)(x)| = 1 which contradicts the assumption |clM(C)(x)| \u2265 2. Proposition 5. Let C be a covering of U . {clM(C)(x) : x \u2208 U} = {A1, A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , As}\u22c3 {{x} : x \u2208 B}.\nPROOF. For all clM(C)(x) \u2208 {clM(C)(x) : x \u2208 U}, if |clM(C)(x)| = 1, then clM(C)(x) = {x} because x \u2208 clM(C)(x). Since C is a covering, there exists a block K of C such that x \u2208 K. If K is a unique block of C such that x \u2208 K, then there exists Ai \u2208 A such that x \u2208 Ai. Moreover, Ai = {x}; otherwise, there exists y 6= x such that y \u2208 Ai. According to the definition of Ai, we have rM(C)({x, y}) = rM(C)(x), i.e, y \u2208 clM(C)(x) which contradicts the assumption |clM(C)(x)| = 1. Hence clM(C)(x) = {x} = Ai. If K is not a unique block of C such that x \u2208 K, then x /\u2208 Ai for all i \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s}. That implies that x \u2208 B. Therefore, clM(C)(x) = {x}, where x \u2208 B. If |clM(C)(x)| 6= 1, then |clM(C)(x)| \u2265 2. According to Lemma 4, we know there exists only one block Ki such that clM(C)(x) \u2286 Ki. According to the definition of A, there exists Aj \u2208 A such that x \u2208 clM(C)(x) \u2286 Aj . \u2200y \u2208 Aj and y 6= x, we know rM(C)({x, y}) = rM(C)(x). Thus y \u2208 clM(C)(x), that is, Aj \u2286 clM(C)(x), therefore, Aj = clM(C)(x). Form above discussion, we conclude that {clM(C)(x) : x \u2208 U} \u2286 {A1, A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , As} \u22c3 {{x} : x \u2208 B}.\nNext, we prove {A1, A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , As} \u22c3 {{x} : x \u2208 B} \u2286 {clM(C)(x) : x \u2208 U}. For all Ai \u2208 {A1, A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , As}, we know there exists a unique block K \u2208 C such that Ai \u2286 K. Thus rM(C)(Ai) = 1. Pitch y \u2208 Ai. Since C is a covering, rM(C)(y) = 1. Thus rM(C)(Ai) = rM(C)(y). Utilizing Lemma 2, we have clM(C)(y) = clM(C)(Ai), which implies that Ai \u2286 clM(C)(y). For all x \u2208 clM(C)(y), rM(C)({x, y}) = 1, i.e., there exists a unique block K of C such that {x, y} \u2286 K. Thus x \u2208 Ai. Therefore clM(C)(y) \u2286 Ai which implies that {A1, A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , As} \u2286 {clM(C)(x) : x \u2208 U}. \u2200x \u2208 B, we claim that clM(C)(x) = {x}. Since {x} \u2286 clM(C)(x), we just need to prove clM(C)(x) \u2286 {x}; otherwise, there exists y \u2208 U and y 6= x such that y \u2208 clM(C)(x).\nUtilizing Lemma 4, there is only one block K of C such that {x, y} \u2286 K. According to the definition of Ai(i \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s}), we know there exists Aj(j \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s}) such that x \u2208 Aj , thus x /\u2208 B which contradicts the assumption that x \u2208 B.\nThe following result is the combination of Theorem 1 and Proposition 5. It presents the atoms of lattice (L(M(C)),\u2286) from covering C directly.\nCorollary 1. Let C be a covering of U . {A1, A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , As} \u22c3 {{x} : x \u2208 B} is the family of atoms of lattice (L(M(C)),\u2286).\nCorollary 1 can also be found in [7]. It provides a method to obtain the atoms of the geometric lattice induced by a covering from the covering directly. We obtain the result from the other different perspective in this paper.\nExample 4. (Continued from Example 3) Based on Corollary 1, the collection of the atoms of lattice (L(M(C)),\u2286) is {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4, 5}}.\n3.2. Atoms characterization for the geometric lattice induced by a covering\nIn subsection 3.1, we have studied the atoms of the geometric lattice induced by a covering and have provided a method to obtain the atoms from the covering directly. As we know, any element of a geometric lattice can be expressed as the joint of some atoms of the lattice. In this subsection, we characterize the geometric lattice induced by a covering through the atoms of it by the union operation. In fact, any element of the lattice can be indicated as the union of all closures of single-point sets in the element. At the beginning of this subsection, we define two operators from the viewpoint of matroids.\nDefinition 6. Let M be a matroid on U and X \u2286 U . One can define the following two operators:\nLM (X) = {x \u2208 U : clM (x) \u2286 X}, HM (X) = {x \u2208 U : clM (x) \u22c2 X 6= \u2205}.\nWe call the two operators are lower and upper approximation operators induced by M .\nIn fact, clM (x) can be regard as the successor neighborhood of x with respect to the relation R defined as xRMy \u21d4 y \u2208 clM (x). It is clear that R is a reflexive and transitive relation. When M = M(C), the relation RM(C) is an equivalence relation on U . Therefore, LM(C) = (RM(C))\u2217 and HM(C) = (RM(C))\u2217. In the following discussion, we study the relationship between the two operators and the elements of the lattice L(M(C)). Then, based on the relationship, we realize the purpose to characterize the lattice through the atoms of it by using union operator. Firstly, we have the following lemma.\nLemma 5. Let R be an equivalence relation of U . For all X \u2286 U , if R\u2217(X) = X , then R\u2217(X) = X .\nPROOF. It is clear that X = {x \u2208 U : [x]R \u2286 X} \u2286 {x \u2208 U : [x]R \u22c2 X 6=\n\u2205} = R\u2217(X). For all y \u2208 R\u2217(X), [y]R \u22c2 X 6= \u2205. Suppose z \u2208 [y]R \u22c2 X . Then y \u2208 [y]R = [z]R \u2286 X , hence R\u2217(X) \u2286 X .\nIn fact, any closed set of the matroid induced by a covering is a fixed point of the two operators induced by the covering.\nProposition 6. Let C be a covering of U . If X \u2208 L(M(C)), then LM(C)(X) = X = HM(C)(X).\nPROOF. Utilizing Lemma 5, we need prove X = LM(C)(X). For all y \u2208 LM(C)(X), y \u2208 clM(C)(y) \u2286 X , thusLM(C)(X) \u2286 X . Conversely, according to (2) of Proposition 2, we know for all y \u2208 X , clM(C)(y) \u2286 X . Thus X \u2286 LM(C)(X). Hence X = LM(C)(X).\nBased on the above result, any element of the geometric lattice induced by a covering can be expressed as the union of all closures of single-point sets in the element.\nTheorem 2. Let C be a covering of U . \u2200X \u2208 L(M(C)), X = \u22c3\nx\u2208X clM(C)(x).\nPROOF. It is obvious when X = \u2205. According to Proposition 6, we have X = {x \u2208 U : clM(C)(x) \u2286 X}. Then x \u2208 clM(C)(x) \u2286 X for all x \u2208 X . Thus X = \u22c3 x\u2208X{x} \u2286 \u22c3 x\u2208X clM(C)(x) \u2286 X . Therefore X = \u22c3 x\u2208X clM(C)(x).\nExample 5. Suppose C is the one shown in Example 3. Combining with Example 4 and Proposition 5, we have clM(C)(\u2205) = \u2205, clM(C)(1) = {1}, clM(C)(2) = {2}, clM(C)(3) = {3} and clM(C)(4) = clM(C)(5) = {4, 5}. Since X = \u22c3 x\u2208X clM(C)(x) for all X \u2208 L(M(C)). Then we obtain L(M(C)) = {\u2205, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4, 5}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 4, 5}, {3, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}}, and the geometric lattice (L(M(C)), \u2286) is shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "4. Application of geometric lattice in attribute reduction", "text": "In section 3, we have studied the geometric lattice structure induced by a covering in detail. In this section, we study how to apply the lattice to attribute reductions from an expanded perspective. Considering the fact that an information system can be converted to a dependence space and studying the reduction issues of the dependence space is equal to studying the issues of the information system, and the fact that a geometric lattice is the lattice of all the closed sets of a finite matroid, hence we take the following measures to realize our purpose. First, we construct one dependence space through a matroid and obtain all the reducts of the space. Second, we built the other dependence space from an information system. Through making these two spaces are equal, we realize the purpose to apply geometric lattices to the issues of attribute reduction of information systems.\n4.1. Application of geometric lattice in the reduction issue of dependence space In this subsection, we apply the geometric lattices to the reduction problems of dependence spaces. First, we make certain what is dependence space. The concept of dependence space can be found in [34], the following lemma introduces it from the viewpoint of set theory.\nLemma 6. [34] Let U be a finite nonempty set. For all T \u2286 2U , denote\n\u0393(T ) = {(B1, B2) \u2208 P (U)\u00d7 P (U) : B1 \u2286 X \u21d4 B2 \u2286 X,\u2200X \u2208 T }.\nThen (U,\u0393(T )) is a dependence space.\nFor a geometric lattice induced by a matroid, one can use its coatoms, namely the hyperplanes of the matroid to induce a dependence space (U,\u0393(H(M))). Before studying the reduction issues of the dependence space, we review the concepts of consistent sets and reducts defined in dependence spaces.\nLet (U,\u0398) be a dependence space. A subset B(\u2286 U) is called a consistent set, if B is minimal with respect to inclusion in its \u0398\u2212 class. If B is called a reduct of U , if B\u0398U and B is a consistent set.\nIn fact, the issue of reduction of dependence space (U,\u0393(T )) has been discussed detailedly in [34].\nLemma 7. [34] B(\u2286 U) is a reduct of (U,\u0393(T )) if and only if B \u2208Min({D\u2032 \u2286 U : D \u22c2 D \u2032 6= \u2205 (\u2200D \u2208 T )}), where T = {D 6= \u2205, U \u2212D \u2208 T }.\nTherefore, we can obtain the following result. It indicates that a subset of a finite nonempty set is a reduct of the dependence space induced by the coatoms of a geometric lattice if and only if it is a minimal set with respect to the property of containing an element from each nonempty complement of any coatom of the lattice. The symbol Com appearing in the proposition below is defined as Com(A) = {X \u2286 U : U\u2212X \u2208 A}, where A is a family subsets of U .\nProposition 7. B is a reduct of (U,\u0393(H(M))) if and only if B \u2208 Min({B \u2286 U : B \u22c2 C 6= \u2205 (\u2200C \u2208 Com(H(M)))}).\nPROOF. According to the definition of hyperplane, we know U /\u2208 H(M). It implies that \u2205 /\u2208 Com(H(M))). Combining Proposition 8 and Lemma 7, we obtain the result.\nExample 6. Suppose lattice is the one shown in Example 5. Then the coatoms H(M) of the lattice is {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 4, 5}, {2, 4, 5}, {3, 4, 5}} and Com(H(M)) = {{3, 4, 5}, {2, 4, 5}, {1, 4, 5}, {2, 3}, {1, 3}, {1, 2}}. They are all nonempty sets. According to Proposition 7, the set of all the reducts of (U, T (H(M))) is {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 5}, {1, 3, 4}, {1, 3, 5}, {2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 5}}.\nConsidering that geometric lattices have a closed relation with matroids, we define the other dependence space from the viewpoint of matroids. It is interesting that the dependence space is equal to the one (U,\u0393(H(M))), which provides us the other approach to realize the purpose to apply the geometric lattice to attribute reduction in subsection 4.2.\nDefinition 7. Let M be a matroid on U . One can define an equivalence relation on 2U as follows: For all B,C \u2286 U ,\nB\u0398MC \u21d4 clM (B) = clM (C).\nLemma 8. [6] Let M be a matroid on U . For all X \u2286 U ,\nclM (X) = { U rM (X) = rM (U),\u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H} rM (X) 6= rM (U).\n(1)\nProposition 8. LetM be a matroid onU . (U,\u0398M ) is a dependence space and \u0393(H(M)) = \u0398M .\nPROOF. If (B1, B2) \u2208 \u0393(H(M)), then B1 \u2286 H \u21d4 B2 \u2286 H for all H \u2208 H(M). We know rM (B1) 6= rM (U) 6= rM (B2). According to Lemma 8, we have clM (B1) =\u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : B1 \u2286 H} = \u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : B2 \u2286 H} = clM (B2). Thus (B1, B2) \u2208 \u0398M which implies that \u0393(H(M)) \u2286 \u0398M . If (B1, B2) \u2208 \u0398M , then clM (B1) = clM (B2). For allH \u2208 H(M), ifB1 \u2286 H , then clM (B1) \u2286 clM (H) = H . thus B2 \u2286 clM (B2) = clM (B1) \u2286 H . Similarly, we can prove the result: For all H \u2208 H(M), if B2 \u2286 H , then B1 \u2286 H . Therefore, \u0398M \u2286 \u0393(H(M)). According to Lemma 6, we know (U,\u0398M ) is a dependence space.\n4.2. An application to information systems In subsection 4.1, we propose two methods to solve the problems of reduction in dependence spaces from matroids and geometric lattices, respectively. In this subsection, we apply the methods to information systems. First, we introduce the concept of information systems.\nDefinition 8. (Information system [34]) An information system is a quadruple form (U,A, F, V ), where U = {x1, x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xn} is a nonempty finite set of objects, A = {a1, a2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , am} is a nonempty finite set of attributes, Vj \u2208 V = {V1, V2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Vm} is the domain of attribute aj and F = {fj : j \u2264 m} is a set of information function such that fj(xi) \u2208 Vj for all xi \u2208 U .\nIn an information system, F , which describes the connection between U and A, is a basis for knowledge discovery. Here, we assume the information system is complete. Let (U,A, F, V ) be an information system. For anyB \u2286 A, the indiscernibility relation is defined as\nRB = {(xi, xj) \u2208 U \u00d7 U : fl(xi) = fl(xj),\u2200al \u2208 B}.\nSpecifically, for any attribute b \u2208 A,\nRb = {(xi, xj) \u2208 U \u00d7 U : fb(xi) = fb(xj)}. It is obvious that RB = \u22c2\nb\u2208B Rb and RB , Rb are equivalence relations of U . Based on above two equivalence relation, we have the following two equivalence relations:\nR = {(B1, B2) \u2208 P (A)\u00d7 P (A) : RB1 = RB2}.\nand\nR0 = {(b, c) \u2208 A\u00d7A,Rb = Rc}.\nIt was noted in [34] that R is an equivalence relation on A and the pair (A,R) is a dependence space. In an information system, B is referred to as a consistent set if RB = RA, and if B is a consistent set and RB\u2212{b} 6= RA (\u2200b \u2208 B), then B is referred to as a reduct of the information system. We find that the reducts defined in the information system is the reducts defined in the dependence space (A,R). In the following discussion, we solve the issues of attribute reduction of information systems starting with the operator R\u22170. As we know, the upper approximation operator R \u2217 0 is a closure operator of a matroid. Similar to Definition 7, we have the following equivalence relation.\nDefinition 9. Let A be a finite nonempty set. For all X,Y \u2286 A, one can define an equivalence relation \u0398 of 2A as follows:\nX\u0398Y \u21d4 R\u22170(X) = R\u22170(Y ).\nAccording to Proposition 8, we know (A,\u0398) is a dependence space, and we can obtain all the reducts of the space through Proposition 7. Next, we want to find out all the reducts of (A,R) with the aid of the space (A,\u0398). The proposition below establishes the relation between \u0398 and R.\nProposition 9. For all X,Y \u2286 A, if RX = RY \u21d2 R\u22170(X) = R\u22170(Y ), then \u0398 = R.\nPROOF. We need to prove R\u22170(X) = R \u2217 0(Y ) \u21d2 RX = RY . If RX 6= RY , then we may as well suppose there exists (xi, xj) \u2208 RX \u2212 RY . Thus for all a \u2208 X , (xi, xj) \u2208 Ra and there exists b \u2208 Y such that (xi, xj) /\u2208 Rb. Consequently, Rb 6= Ra for all a \u2208 X . That implies that b /\u2208 R\u22170(X) = {x \u2208 A, [x]R0 \u22c2 X 6= \u2205}. It clear that b \u2208 R\u22170(Y ) because b \u2208 Y and b \u2208 [b]R0 . Therefore, R\u22170(X) 6= R\u22170(Y ), a contradiction! Hence we have R\u22170(X) = R \u2217 0(Y ) \u21d2 RX = RY . According to the assumption, we have RX = RY \u21d2 R\u22170(X) = R\u22170(Y ). Therefore \u0398 = R0.\nWhen an information system satisfies the condition presented in Proposition 9, then we can find and prove a method to attribute reduction of the information system. The method is described as follows: Arbitrarily select an element in each Pi(\u2208 A/R0) to compose a new set, which is just the reduct of the information system.\nProposition 10. Let (U,A, F, V ) be an information system andA/R0 = {P1, P2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Ps}. For all X,Y \u2286 A, if RX = RY \u21d2 R\u22170(X) = R\u22170(Y ), then the following condition holds: B is a reduct of (U,A, F, V ) if and only if B = {p1, p2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ps}, where pi \u2208 Pi, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s.\nPROOF. Suppose R\u22170 is a closure operator of matroid M . It is clear that H(M) = {A \u2212 Pi : i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s}. Combining with Proposition 7 and 9, we have B is a reduct of (U,A, F, V ) if and only if B \u2208 Min({B \u2286 A : B \u22c2 C 6= \u2205(\u2200C \u2208\nCom(H(M)))}) = Min({B \u2286 A : B \u22c2 C 6= \u2205(\u2200C \u2208 A/R0)}) = {B \u2286 A :\n|B \u22c2 Pi| = 1, i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s}.\nA relation table entirely determines an information system. The following example presents how to use above results to find all the reducts of an information system.\nExample 7. Let (U,A, F, V ) be an information system which is shown in table 1. It\nis obvious that U/Ra1 = U/Ra3 = U/R{a1,a3} = {{x1}, {x2, x3, x4}}, U/Ra2 = {{x1, x4}, {x2}, {x3}} and U/R{a1,a2} = U/R{a2,a3} = U/R{a1,a2,a3} = {{x1}, {x2}, {x3}, {x4}}. Then R0 = {{a1, a3}, {a2}}. It is easy to check that any two subsets X and Y of A satisfy the condition: RX = RY \u21d2 R\u22170(X) = R\u22170(X). Hence we can obtain all the reducts of (U,A, F, V ) are {a1, a2} and {a2, a3}."}, {"heading": "5.

Geometric lattices have been widely used in many fields, especially greedy algorithm design which plays an important role in the reduction problems. Therefore, it is meaningful to combine coverings with geometric lattices to solve the optimization problems. In this paper, we obtain geometric lattices from coverings through matroids and then apply them to the issue of attribute reduction. First, a geometric lattice structure of a covering is constructed through transversal matroids. Then its atoms are studied and used to describe the lattice. Second, considering that all the closed sets of a finite matroid form a geometric lattice, we propose a dependence space through matroids and study the attribute reduction issues of the space, which realizes the application of geometric lattices to attribute reduction. Furthermore, a special type of information system is taken as an example to illustrate the application. In a word, this work points out an interesting view, namely, geometric lattice to study the attribute reduction issues of information systems.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
