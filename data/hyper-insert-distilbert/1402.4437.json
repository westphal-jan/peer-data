Introduction", "text": "Recently, the field of deep learning has produced some remarkable breakthroughs. The hallmark of the deep learning approach is to learn multiple layers of representation of data, and much work has gone into the development of representation learning modules such as RBMs and their generalizations (Welling et al., 2005), and autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2008). However, at this point it is not quite clear what makes a good representation. In this paper, we take a fresh look at the basic principles behind unsupervised representation learning from the perspective of Lie group theory1.\n1We will at times assume a passing familiarity with Lie groups, but the main ideas of this paper should be accessible to a broad audience.\nProceedings of the 31 st International Conference on Machine Learning, Beijing, China, 2014. JMLR: W&CP volume 32. Copyright 2014 by the author(s).\nVarious desiderata for learned representations have been expressed, including meaningful (Bengio & Lecun, 2014), invariant (Goodfellow et al., 2009), abstract and disentangled (Bengio et al., 2013) representations, but so far most of these notions have not been defined in a mathematically precise way. We focus on the notions of invariance and disentangling, leaving the search for meaning for future work.\nWhat do we mean, intuitively, when we speak of invariance and disentangling? A disentangled representation is one that explicitly represents the distinct factors of variation in the data. For example, visual data can be thought of as a composition of object identity, position and pose, lighting conditions, etc. Once disentangling is achieved, invariance follows easily: to build a representation that is invariant to a transformation (e.g. a change in object position) that is considered a nuisance for a particular task (e.g. object classification), one can simply ignore the units in the representation that encode position.\nTo get a mathematical handle on the heretofore vague concept of disentangling, we borrow a fundamental principle from physics, which we refer to as Weyl\u2019s principle, following Kanatani (1990). In physics, this idea is used to tease appart (i.e. disentangle) the elementary particles of a physical system from mere measurement values that have no inherent physical significance. We apply this principle to the area of vision, for after all, pixels are nothing but physical measurements.\nWeyl\u2019s principle presupposes a symmetry group that acts on the data. By this we mean a set of transformations that does not change the \u201cessence\u201d of the measured phenomenon, although it may change the \u201csuperficial appearance\u201d, i.e. the measurement values. As a concrete example that we will use throughout this paper, consider the group known as SO(2), acting on images by 2D rotation about the origin. A transformation from this group (a rotation) may change the value of every pixel in the image, but leaves invariant the identity of the imaged object. Weyl\u2019s principle states that the elementary components of this system (the world as measured by a camera) are given by the irre-\nducible representations of the symmetry group \u2013 a concept that will be explained in this paper.\nWe demonstrate this theoretical principle using the socalled toroidal subgroups of the special orthogonal group as symmetry groups. This class includes several groups of practical interest, such as image rotations and translations. We introduce a probabilistic model, which we call Toroidal Subgroup Analysis (TSA), and show how it can be learned from pairs of images related by arbitrary and unobserved transformations in the group. Using a novel conjugate prior, the model integrates probability theory and Lie group theory in a very elegant way. All the relevant probabilistic quantities such as normalization constants, moments, KL-divergences, the posterior density over the transformation group, the marginal density in data space, and their gradients can be obtained in closed form. This complete tractability is a rather exceptional property among probabilistic graphical models with non-linear interactions.\nThe parameters of the posterior distribution over the transformation group provide a disentangled representation of the data that can be split into invariant and equivariant components. The structure of the learned group dictates a particular pooling scheme for computing invariants, reproducing a key feature of convolutional networks (LeCun & Bottou, 1998). When trained on shifts, the model learns to perform a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), thus providing a probablistic interpretation of Fourier analysis and opening up the possibility of learning appropriate probabilistic generalizations of the DFT for a particular signal."}, {"heading": "1.1. Related work", "text": "The first to propose an algorithm for learning Lie groups from data were Rao & Ruderman (1999). This work was later extended by Miao and Rao (2007). The first model deals only with one-parameter Lie groups, while the later work incorporates multiple transformation types. These works left open the problem of efficiently inferring transformation parameters for non-infinitesimal transformations. This problem was solved by Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2010) using an elegant adaptive smoothing technique, making it possible to learn from large transformations.\nOther, non group theoretical approaches to learning transformations and invariant representations exist that do something similar to the irreducible reduction of a toroidal group, but this has not been recognized as a general principle for disentangling that is applicable to other groups, too. Gating models (Memisevic & Hinton, 2010) were found to perform a kind of eigenspace analysis (Memisevic, 2012), which is similar in spirit to the TSA model. However, gating models require far more parameters because they must tile each eigenspace with many pairs of filters whereas TSA\nrequires only two per eigenspace. Motivated by a number of statistical phenomena observed in natural images, Cadieu & Olshausen (2012) describe a model that decomposes a signal into invariant amplitudes and model transformations using phase variables.\nNone of the mentioned methods take into account the full uncertainty over transformation parameters, as does TSA. Because a unique transformation relating two images cannot in general be inferred, a multimodal posterior is required to give a complete description of the geometric situation. Furthermore, posterior inference in our model is very fast, whereas the MAP inference algorithm by SohlDicksteint et al. requires a more expensive iterative optimization."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1. Equivalence, Invariance and Reducibility", "text": "In this section, we discuss three fundamental concepts on which the analysis in the rest of this paper is based: equivalence, invariance and reducibility.\nConsider a function \u03a6 : RD \u2192 X that assigns to each possible data point x \u2208 RD a class-label (X = {1, . . . , L} being a discrete set of labels in this case) or some distributed representation (e.g. X = RL). Such a function induces an equivalence relation on the input space RD: we say that two vectors x,y \u2208 RD are \u03a6-equivalent if they are mapped onto the same representation by \u03a6. Symbolically, x \u2261\u03a6 y \u21d4 \u03a6(x) = \u03a6(y). Every equivalence relation on the input space fully determines a symmetry group acting on the space. This group, call it G, contains all transformations \u03c1 : RD \u2192 RD that leave \u03a6 invariant: G = {\u03c1 |\u03a6(\u03c1(x)) = \u03a6(x)}. G describes the symmetries of \u03a6, or, stated differently, the label function/representation\u03a6 is invariant to transformations in G acting on the input space. Hence, we can speak of Geqiuvalence: x \u2261G y \u21d4 \u2203\u03c1 \u2208 G : \u03c1(x) = y. For example, if G is the group of 2D image rotations, two images are G-equivalent if they are rotations of each other.\nBefore we can introduce Weyl\u2019s principle, we need one more concept: the reduction of a group representation. Let us assume that \u03c1 acts linearly on our measurement space R\nD so that we can write \u03c1(x) = Qx for a matrix Q \u2208 G. In general, every coordinate yi of y = Qx can depend on every coordinate xj of x. Since x \u2261G y, it makes no sense to consider the coordinates xi as separate quantities; we can only consider the vector x as a unit because a symmetry transformation Q tangles all coordinates.\nHowever, we are free to change the basis of the measurement space. It may be possible to use a change of basis to expose an invariant subspace: a subspace V \u2282 RD that\nis mapped onto itself by every transformation in the group: \u2200Q \u2208 G : x \u2208 V \u21d2 Qx \u2208 V . If such a subspace exists and its orthogonal complement V \u22a5 \u2282 RD is also an invariant subspace, then it makes sense to consider the two parts of x that lie in V and V \u22a5 be distinct quantities because they remain distinct under symmetry transformations.\nLet W be a change of basis matrix that exposes the invariant subspaces, that is,\nQ = W\n[\nQ1 Q2\n]\nW\u22121, (1)\nfor all Q \u2208 G. The matricesQ1 andQ2 are functions of Q, and each forms a representation of the same abstract group as represented byQ. The group representationsQ1 and Q2 describe how the individual parts x1 \u2208 V and x2 \u2208 V \u22a5 are transformed by the elements of the group. Following common practice, we refer to both the group representations Q1,Q2 and the subspaces V and V \u22a5 corresponding to these group representations as \u201crepresentations\u201d.\nThe process of reduction can be applied recursively to Q1 and Q2. If at some point there is no more (non-trivial) invariant subspace, the representation is called irreducible. Weyl\u2019s principle states that the elementary components of a system are the irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the system. Properly understood, it is not a physics principle at all, but generally applicable to any situation where there is a well-defined notion of equivalence. It is completely abstract and therefore agnostic about the type of data (images, optical flows, sound, etc.), making it eminently useful for representation learning.\nIn the rest of this paper, we will demonstrate Weyl\u2019s principle in the simple case of a compact commutative subgroup of the special orthogonal group (these terms are explained below). We want to stress though, that there is no reason the basic ideas cannot be applied to non-commutative groups acting on non-linear latent representation spaces."}, {"heading": "2.2. Maximal Tori in the Orthogonal Group", "text": "In order to facilitate analysis, we will from here on consider only compact commutative subgroups of the special orthogonal group SO(D). For reasons that will become clear shortly, such groups are called toroidal subgroups of SO(D). Intuitively, the toroidal subgroups of general compact Lie groups can be thought of as the \u201ccommutative part\u201d of these groups. This fact, combined with their analytic tractability (evidenced by the results in this paper) makes them suitable as the starting point of a theory of probabilistic Lie-group learning.\nImposing the constraint of orthogonality will make the computation of matrix inverses very cheap, because for orthogonal Q, Q\u22121 = QT . Orthogonal matrices also avoid\nnumerical problems, because their condition number is always equal to 1. Another important property of orthogonal transformations is that they leave the Euclidean metric invariant: \u2016Qx\u2016 = \u2016x\u2016. Therefore, orthogonal matrices cannot express transformations such as contrast scaling, but they can still model the interesting structural changes in images (Bethge et al., 2007). For example, since 2D image rotation and (cyclic) translation are linear and do not change the total energy (norm) of the image, they can be represented by orthogonal matrices acting on vectorized images.\nAs is well known, commuting matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized, so one could represent a toroidal group in terms of a basis of eigenvectors shared by every element in the group, and one diagonal matrix of eigenvalues for each element of the group, as was done in (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2010) for 1-parameter Lie groups. However, orthogonal matrices do not generally have a complete set of real eigenvectors. One could use a complex basis instead, but this introduces redundancies because the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an orthogonal matrix come in complex conjugate pairs. For machine learning applications, this is clearly an undesirable feature, so we opt for a joint block-diagonalization of the elements Q of the toroidal group: Q(\u03d5) = WR(\u03d5)WT , where W is orthogonal and R(\u03d5) is a block-diagonal rotation matrix2:\nR(\u03d5) =\n\n  R(\u03d51) . . .\nR(\u03d5J)\n\n  . (2)\nThe diagonal of R(\u03d5) contains 2\u00d7 2 rotation matrices\nR(\u03d5j) =\n[\ncos(\u03d5j) \u2212 sin(\u03d5j) sin(\u03d5j) cos(\u03d5j)\n]\n(3)\nIn this parameterization, the real, orthogonal basis W identifies the group representation, while the vector of rotation angles \u03d5 identifies a particular element Q(\u03d5) of the group. It is now clear why such groups are called \u201ctoroidal\u201d: the parameter space \u03d5 is periodic in each element \u03d5j and hence is a topological torus. For a J-parameter toroidal group, all the \u03d5j can be chosen freely. Such a group is known as a maximal torus in SO(D), for which we write T J = {\u03d5 |\u03d5j \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], j = 1, . . . J}.\nTo gain insight into the structure of toroidal groups with fewer parameters, we rewrite eq. 2 using the matrix exponential:\nR(\u03d5) = exp\n\n\nJ \u2211\nj=1\n\u03d5jAj\n\n (4)\nThe the anti-symmetric matrices Aj = dd\u03d5j R(\u03d5) \u2223 \u2223 0 are\n2For ease of exposition, we asume an even dimensional space D = 2J , but the equations are easily generalized.\nknown as the Lie algebra generators, and the \u03d5j are Liealgebra coordinates.\nThe Lie algebra is a structure that largely determines the structure of the corresponding Lie group, while having the important advantage of forming a linear space. That is, all linear combinations of the generators belong to the Lie algebra, and each element of the Lie algebra corresponds to a transformation in the Lie group, which itself is a non-linear manifold. Furthermore, every subgroup of the Lie group corresponds to a subalgebra (not defined here) of the Lie algebra. All toroidal groups are the subgroup of some maximal torus, so we can learn a general toroidal group by first learning a maximal torus and then learning a subalgebra of its Lie algebra. Due to commutativity, the structure of the Lie algebra of toroidal groups is such that any subspace of the Lie algebra is in fact a subalgebra. The relevance of this observation to our machine learning problem is that to learn a toroidal group with I parameters (I < J), we can simply learn a maximal toroidal group and then learn an I-dimensional linear subspace in the space of \u03d5.\nIn this work, we are interested in compact subgroups only3, which is to say that the parameter space should be closed and bounded. To see that not all subgroups of a maximal torus are compact, consider a 4D space and a maximal torus with 2 generators A1 and A2. Let us define a subalgebra with one generator A = \u03c91A1 + \u03c92A2, for real numbers \u03c91 and \u03c92. The group elements generated by this algebra through the exponential map take the form\nR(s) = exp (sA) =\n[\nR(\u03c91s) R(\u03c92s)\n]\n. (5)\nEach R(\u03c9js) is periodic with period 2\u03c0/\u03c9j , but their combination R(s) need not be. When \u03c91 and \u03c92 are not commensurate, all values of s \u2208 R will produce different R(s). To obtain a compact one-parameter group with parameter space s \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], we restrict the frequencies \u03c9j to be integers, so that R(s) = R(s+2\u03c0) (see figure 1). To get a feel for what this means in the case of 2D image rotation, see figure 3: the radial frequency of each filter pair corresponds to the value \u03c9j for that pair.\nIt is easy to see that each block of R(s) forms an irreducible representation of the entire group that acts on the data. From the point of view expounded in section 2.1, we should view the vector x as a tangle of elementary components uj = WTj x, where Wj = (W(:, 2j\u22121),W(:, 2j)) denotes the D \u00d7 2 submatrix of W corresponding to the j-th block in R(s). Each one of the elementary parts uj is functionally independent of the others under symmetry\n3The main reason for this restriction is that compact groups are simpler and better understood than non-compact groups. In practice, many non-compact groups can be compactified, so not much is lost.\ntransformations.\nThe variable \u03c9j is known as the weight of the representation (Kanatani, 1990). When the representations are equivalent (i.e. they have the same weight), the parts are \u201cof the same kind\u201d and are transformed identically. Elementary components with different weights transform differently.\nIn the following section, we show how a maximal toroidal group and a 1-parameter subgroup can be learned from correspondence pairs, and how these can be used to generate invariant representations."}, {"heading": "3. Toroidal Subgroup Analysis", "text": "We will start by modelling a maximal torus. A data pair (x,y) is related by a transformation Q = WR(\u03d5)WT from the group representation:\ny = WR(\u03d5)WTx+ \u01eb, (6)\nwhere \u01eb \u223c N (0, \u03c32) represents isotropic Gaussian noise. In other symbols, p(y|x, \u03d5) = N (y|WR(\u03d5)WTx, \u03c32). We will find it useful to introduce some notation for indexing invariant subspaces. As before, Wj = (W(:, 2j\u22121),W(:, 2j)). Let uj = WTj x and vj = W T j y. If we want to access one of the coordinates of u or v, we write uj1 = W T (:, 2j\u22121)x or uj2 = W T (:, 2j)x.\nWe assume the \u03d5j to be marginally indepent and von-Mises distributed. The von-Mises distribution is an exponential family that assigns equal density to the endpoints of any length-2\u03c0 interval of the real line, making it a suitable choice for periodic variables such as \u03d5j . We will find it useful to move back and forth between the conventional and natural parameterizations of this distribution. The conventional parameterization of the von-Mises distribution M(\u03d5|\u00b5, \u03ba) uses a mean \u00b5 and precision \u03ba:\np(\u03d5j) = 1\n2\u03c0I0(\u03baj) exp (\u03baj cos(\u03d5j \u2212 \u00b5j)). (7)\nThe function I0 that appears in the normalizing constant is known as the modified Bessel function of order 0.\nSince the von-Mises distribution is an exponential family, we can write it in terms of natural parameters \u03b7j = (\u03b7j1 , \u03b7j2) T as follows:\np(\u03d5j) = 1\n2\u03c0I0(\u2016\u03b7j\u2016) exp (\u03b7Tj T (\u03d5j)), (8)\nwhere T (\u03d5j) = (cos(\u03d5j), sin(\u03d5j))T are the sufficient statistics. The natural parameters can be computed from conventional parameters using,\n\u03b7j = \u03baj [cos(\u00b5j), sin(\u00b5j)] T (9)\nand vice versa,\n\u03baj = \u2016\u03b7j\u2016, \u00b5j = tan\u22121(\u03b7j2/\u03b7j1) (10)\nUsing the natural parameterization, it is easy to see that the prior is conjugate to the likelihood, so that the posterior p(\u03d5|x,y) is again a product of von-Mises distributions. Such conjugacy relations are of great utility in Bayesian statistics, because they simplify sequential inference. To our knowledge, this conjugacy relation has not been described before. First observe that the likelihood term splits into a sum over the invariant subspaces indexed by j:\np(\u03d5|x,y) \u221d p(y|x, \u03d5)p(\u03d5)\n\u221d exp ( \u2212 1 2\u03c32 \u2016y \u2212WR(\u03d5)WTx\u20162 ) p(\u03d5)\n\u221d exp\n\n\nJ \u2211\nj=1\nvTj R(\u03d5j)uj\n\u03c32 + \u03b7Tj T (\u03d5j)\n\n\nBoth the bilinear forms vTj R(\u03d5j)uj and the the prior terms \u03b7Tj T (\u03d5) are linear functions of cos(\u03d5j) and sin(\u03d5j), so that they can be combined into a single dot product:\np(\u03d5|x,y) \u221d exp\n\n\nJ \u2211\nj=1\n\u03b7\u0302Tj T (\u03d5j)\n\n, (11)\nwhich we recognize as a product of von-Mises in natural form.\nThe parameters \u03b7\u0302j of the posterior are given by:\n\u03b7\u0302j = \u03b7j + 1\n\u03c32 [uj1vj1 + uj2vj2 , uj1vj2 \u2212 uj2vj1 ]T\n= \u03b7j + \u2016uj\u2016\u2016vj\u2016\n\u03c32 [cos(\u03b8j), sin(\u03b8j)]\nT ,\n(12)\nwhere \u03b8j is the angle between uj and vj . Geometrically, we can interpret the Bayesian updating procedure in eq. 12 as follows. The orientation of the natural parameter vector\n\u03b7j determines the mean of the von-Mises, while its magnitude determines the precision. To update this parameter with new information obtained from data uj , vj , one should add the vector (cos(\u03b8j), sin(\u03b8j))T to the prior, using a scaling factor that grows with the magnitude of uj and vj and declines with the square of the noise level \u03c3. The longer uj and vj and the smaller the noise level, the greater the precision of the observation. This geometrically sensible result follows directly from the consistent application of the rules of probability.\nObserve that when using a uniform prior (i.e. \u03b7j = 0), the posterior mean \u00b5\u0302j (computed from \u03b7\u0302j by eq. 10) will be exactly equal to the angle \u03b8j between uj and vj . We will use this fact in section 3.1 when we derive the formula for the orbit distance in a toroidal group.\nPrevious approaches to Lie group learning only provide point estimates of the transformation parameters, which have to be obtained using an expensive iterative optimization procedure (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2010). In contrast, TSA provides a full tractable posterior distribution which is obtained using a simple feed-forward computation. Compared to the work of Cadieu & Olshausen (2012), our model deals well with low-energy subspaces, by simply describing the uncertainty in the estimate instead of providing inaccurate estimates that have to be discarded."}, {"heading": "3.1. Invariant Representation and Metric", "text": "One way of doing invariant classification is by using an invariant metric known as the manifold distance. This metric d(x,y) is defined as the minimum distance between the orbits Ox = {Qx |Q \u2208 G} and Oy = {Qy |Q \u2208 G}. Observe that this is only a true metric that satisfies the coincidence axiom d(x,y) = 0 \u21d4 x = y if we take the condition x = y to mean \u201cequivalence up to symmetry transformations\u201d or x \u2261G y, as discussed in section 2.1. In practice, it has proven difficult to compute this distance exactly, so approximations such as tangent distance have been invented (Simard et al., 2000). But for a maximal torus, we can easily compute the exact manifold distance:\nd2(x,y) = min \u03d5 \u2016y\u2212WR(\u03d5)WTx\u20162\n= \u2211\nj\nmin \u03d5j\n\u2016vj \u2212R(\u03d5j)uj\u20162\n= \u2211\nj\n\u2016vj \u2212R(\u00b5\u0302j)uj\u20162,\n(13)\nwhere \u00b5\u0302j is the mean of the posterior p(\u03d5j |x,y), obtained using a uniform prior (\u03baj = 0). The last step of eq. 13 follows, because as we saw in the previous section, \u00b5\u0302j is simply the angle between uj and vj when using a uniform prior. Therefore, R(\u00b5\u0302j) aligns uj and vj , thereby minimizing the distance.\nAnother approach to invariant classification is through an invariant representation. Although the model presented above aims to describe the transformation between observations x and y, an invariant-equivariant representation appears automatically in terms of the parameters of the posterior over the group. To see this, consider all the transformations in the learned toroidal group G that take an image x to itself. This set is known as the stabilizer stabG(x) of x. It is a subgroup of G and describes the symmetries of x with respect to G. When a transformation Q \u2208 G is applied to x, the stabilizer subgroup is left invariant, for if P \u2208 stabG(x) then P(Qx) = Q(Px) = Qx and hence P \u2208 stabG(Qx). The posterior of x transformed into itself, p(\u03d5|x,x, \u00b5, \u03ba = 0) = \u220f\nj M(\u03d5j |\u00b5\u0302j , \u03ba\u0302j) gives a probabilistic description of the stabilizer of x, and hence must be invariant. Clearly, the angle between x and x is zero, so \u00b5\u0302 = 0. On the other hand, \u03ba\u0302 contains information about x and is invariant. To see this, recall that \u03ba\u0302j = \u2016\u03b7\u0302j\u2016. Using eq. 12 we obtain \u03ba\u0302j = \u2016uj\u20162\u03c3\u22122 = \u2016WTj x\u20162\u03c3\u22122. Since every transformation Q in the learned toroidal group acts on the 2D vector uj by rotation, the length of uj is left invariant.\nWe recognize the computation of \u03ba\u0302 as the square pooling operation often applied in convolutional networks to gain invariance: project an image onto filters W2j\u22121,. and W2j,. and sum the squares. This computation follows as a necessary consequence of our model setup. In section 3.3, we will find that the model for non-maximal tori is even more informative about the proper pooling scheme.\nSince we want to use \u03ba\u0302 as an invariant representation, we should try to find an appropriate metric on \u03ba\u0302space. Let \u03ba\u0302(x) be defined by p(\u03d5|x,x, \u03ba = 0) = \u220f\nj M(\u03d5|\u00b5\u0302j , \u03ba\u0302j(x)).

The first step of this derivation uses eq. 12 under a uniform prior (\u03b7j = 0), while the second step again makes use of the fact that \u00b5\u0302j is the angle between uj and vj so that \u2016uj\u2016\u2016vj\u2016 = uTj R(\u00b5\u0302j)vj ."}, {"heading": "3.2. Relation to the Discrete Fourier Transform", "text": "We show that the DFT is a special case of TSA.

If we choose a basis of sinusoids for the filters in W,\nW(:, 2j\u22121) = R(\u03c1 \u2212j, . . . , \u03c1\u2212j(D\u22121))T\n= (cos(2\u03c0j/D), . . . , cos(2\u03c0j(D \u2212 1)/D))T\nW(:, 2j) = I(\u03c1 \u2212j , . . . , \u03c1\u2212j(D\u22121))T\n= (sin(\u22122\u03c0j/D), . . . , sin(\u22122\u03c0j(D \u2212 1)/D))T , (15)\nthen the change of basis performed by W is a DFT. Specifically, R(Xj) = uj1 and I(Xj) = uj2 .\nNow suppose we are interested in the transformation taking some arbitrary fixed vector e = W(1, 0, . . . , 1, 0)T to x. The posterior over \u03d5j is p(\u03d5j |e,x, \u03b7j = 0, \u03c3 = 1) = M(\u03d5j |\u03b7\u0302j), where (by eq. 12) we have \u03b7\u0302j = \u2016uj\u2016[cos(\u03b8j), sin(\u03b8j)]T , \u03b8j being the angle between uj and the \u201creal axis\u201d ej = (1, 0)T . In conventional coordinates, the precision of the posterior is equal to the modulus of the DFT, \u03ba\u0302j = \u2016uj\u2016 = |Xj |, and the mean of the posterior is equal to the phase of the Fourier transform, \u00b5\u0302 = \u03b8j = arg(Xj). Therefore, TSA provides a probabilistic interpretation of the DFT, and makes it possible to learn an appropriate generalized transform from data."}, {"heading": "3.3. Modeling a Lie subalgebra", "text": "Typically, one is interested in learning groups with fewer than J degrees of freedom. Since the stabilizer representation is invariant to all transformations from the maximal torus which contains the symmetry group of interest, it is certainly also invariant to the subgroup of the maximal torus that is the true symmetry group. However, this representation will identify vectors that are in fact distinct from the point of view of the true symmetry group.\nAs we have seen, for one parameter compact subgroups of a maximal torus, the weights of the irreducible representations must be integers. We model this using a coupled rotation matrix, as follows:\nQ(s) = W\n\n  R(\u03c91s) . . .\nR(\u03c9Js)\n\n  WT (16)\nWhere s \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] is the scalar parameter of this subgroup. The likelihood then becomes y \u223c N (y|Q(s)x, \u03c32).\nThe right prior for this likelihood is the generalized vonMises (Gatto & Jammalamadaka, 2007):\np(s) = M+(s|\u03b7+) = exp ( \u03b7+ \u00b7 T+(s) ) / Z+\n= exp\n\n\nK \u2211\nj=1\n\u03ba+j cos(js\u2212 \u00b5+j )\n\n / Z+\nwhere T+(s) = [cos(s), sin(s), . . . , cos(Ks), sin(Ks)]T .\nUsing similar reasoning as in the non-coupled case, we find that this prior is conjugate to the coupled likelihood, so that p(s|x,y) \u221d exp (\u03b7\u0302+ \u00b7 T+(s)), with:\n\u03b7\u0302+j = \u03b7 + j +\n\u2211\nk:\u03c9k=j\n\u03b7\u0302k (17)\nwhere \u03b7\u0302k is obtained from eq. 12 using a uniform prior \u03b7k = 0. The sum in this update equation performs a pooling operation over a weight space, meaning those invariant subspaces k whose weight \u03c9k = j. In fact, the norm of any linear combination of same-weight representations is invariant, and the maximum of any two \u03b7\u0302j or \u03b7\u0302 + j is also invariant (Kanatani, 1990). The similarity to sum-pooling and max-pooling in convnets is striking, but whereas in convnets the filters adapt to a fixed pooling scheme, a TSA model can adapt the representation weights \u03c9 so as to perform the right kind of pooling.\nIn the non-coupled model, there are J = D/2 degrees of freedom in the group and the invariant representation is D \u2212 J = J-dimensional (\u03ba\u03021, . . . , \u03ba\u0302J ). For the coupled model, there is only one degree of freedom in the group, so the invariant representation should be D \u2212 1 dimensional. In the mathematically clean case where all \u03c9k are distinct, we have J variables \u03ba+1 , . . . , \u03ba + J that are invariant. Furthermore, from eq. 16 we see that as x is transformed, the angle between x and an arbitrary fixed reference vector in subspace j transforms as \u03b8j(s) = \u03b4j + \u03c9js for some data-dependent initial phase \u03b4j . It follows that \u03c9j\u03b8k(s) \u2212 \u03c9k\u03b8j(s) = \u03c9j(\u03b4k + \u03c9ks) \u2212 \u03c9k(\u03b4j + \u03c9js) = \u03c9j\u03b4k \u2212 \u03c9k\u03b4j is invariant. In this way, we can easily construct another J \u2212 1 invariants, but unfortunately these are not stable because the angle estimates can be inaccurate for low-energy subspaces. We leave the problem of devising a stable representation and a sensible metric on this space for future work.\nThe normalization constant Z+ for the GvM has so far only been described for the case of K = 2 harmonics, but we have found a closed form solution in terms of the socalled modified Generalized Bessel Functions (GBF) of Kvariables \u03ba+ = \u03ba+1 , . . . , \u03ba + K and parameters exp (\u2212i\u00b5+) = exp (\u2212i\u00b5+1 ), . . . , exp (\u2212i\u00b5+K) (Dattoli et al., 1991):\nZ+(\u03ba+, \u00b5+) = 2\u03c0I0(\u03ba +; e\u2212i\u00b5\n+\n). (18)\nWe have developed a novel, highly scalable algorithm for the computation of GBF of many variables, which is described in the supplementary material.\nFigure 2 shows the posterior over s for three image pairs related by different rotations and containing different symmetries. The weights W and \u03c9 were learned by the procedure described in the next section. It is quite clear from this figure that MAP inference does not give a complete description of the possible transformations relating the images when the images have a degree of rotational symmetry. The posterior distribution of our model provides a sensible way to deal with this kind of uncertainty, which (in the case of 2D translations) is at the heart of the well known aperture problem in vision. Thus, our model could be used to estimate \u201cmultimodal optical flows\u201d. Having a tractable posterior is also particularly important if the model is to be used to estimate longer sequences (akin to HMM/LDS models, but non-linear), where one may encounter multiple high-density trajectories.\nIf required, accurate MAP inference can be performed using the algorithm of Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2010), as described in the supplementary material. This allows us to compute the exact manifold distance for the coupled model."}, {"heading": "3.4. Maximum Marginal Likelihood Learning", "text": "We train the model by gradient descent on the marginal likelihood.

The derivation of this result\ncan be found in the supplementary material.\nThe gradient of the log marginal likelihood of the uncoupled model w.r.t. a batch X,Y (both storing N vectors in the columns) is:\nd\ndW ln p(Y|X) = X(RT (\u00b5)WTY A+WTX By)T\n+Y(R(\u00b5)WTX A+WTY Bx)T .\nwhere we have used (P Q)2j,n = Qj,nP2j,n and (P Q)2j\u22121,n = Qj,nP2j\u22121,n as a \u201csubspace weighting\u201d operation.

Y).\nThe gradient of the coupled model is easily computed using the differential recurrence relations that hold for the GBF (Dattoli et al., 1991).\nWe use minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) on the log-likelihood of the uncoupled model. After every parameter update, we orthogonalizeW by setting all singular values to 1: Let U,S,V = svd(W), then set W := UV. This procedure and all previous derivations still work when the basis is undercomplete, i.e. has fewer columns (filters) than rows (dimensions in data space). To learn \u03c9j , we estimate the relative angular velocity \u03c9j = \u03b8j/\u03b4 from a batch of image patches rotated by a sub-pixel amount \u03b4 = 0.1\u25e6."}, {"heading": "4.

The learning rate \u03b1 was initialized at \u03b10 = 0.25 and decayed as \u03b1 = \u03b10/ \u221a T , where T was incremented by one with each pass through the data. Each minibatch consisted of 100 data pairs. After learning W, we estimate the weights \u03c9j and sort the filter pairs by increasing absolute value for visualization. As can be seen in fig. 3, the filters are very clean and the weights are estimated correctly except for a few filters on row 1 and 2 that are assigned weight 0 when in fact they have a higher frequency.\nWe tested the utility of the model for invariant classification on a rotated version of the MNIST dataset, using a 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier. Each digit was rotated by a random angle and rescaled to 16 \u00d7 16 pixels, resulting in\n60k training examples and 10k testing examples, with no rotated duplicates.

The results in fig. 4 show that TD outperforms ED, but is outperformed by \u221a \u03ba\u0302 and MD by a large margin.
