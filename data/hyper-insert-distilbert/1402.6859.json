INTRODUCTION", "text": "Data mining, in general, deals with the discovery of nontrivial, hidden and interesting knowledge from different types of data. With the development of information technologies, the number of databases, as well as their dimension and complexity, grow rapidly. It is necessary what we need automated analysis of great amount of information. The analysis results are then used for making a decision by a human or program. One of the basic problems of data mining is the outlier detection.\nAn outlier is an observation of the data that deviates from other observations so much that it arouses suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism from the most part of data [1]. Inlier, on the other hand, is defined as an observation that is explained by underlying probability density function. This function represents probability distribution of main part of data observations [2].\nMany data-mining algorithms manipulate outliers as a sideproduct of clustering algorithms. However these techniques define outliers as points, which do not lie in clusters. Thus, the techniques implicitly define outliers as the background noise in which the clusters are embedded. Another class of techniques defines outliers as points, which are neither a part of a cluster nor a part of the background noise; rather they are specifically points which behave very differently from the norm [3]. Some noisy points may be far away from the data points, whereas the others may be close. The faraway noisy points would affect the result more significantly because they are more different from the data points. It is desirable to identify and remove the outliers, which are far away from all the other points in cluster [4]. So, to improve the clustering\nsuch algorithms use the same process and functionality to solve both clustering and outlier discovery [2].\nIn this paper, we propose a clustering-based technique to identify outliers and simultaneously produce data clustering. Proposed outlier detection process at the same time is effective for extracting clusters and very efficient in finding outliers."}, {"heading": "2.

OUTLIER DETECTION METHODS", "text": "In outlier detection methods based on clustering, outlier is defined to be an observation that does not fit to the overall clustering pattern [6]. The ability to detect outliers can be improved using a combined perspective of outlier detection and clustering. Some clustering algorithms [7-16] handle outliers as special observations, but their main concern is clustering the dataset, not detecting outliers. The following techniques have been proposed to detect outliers:\nBegin 1. Multiple sub-samples {S1, S2, ...,Sj}; 2. For m = 1 to j do\nGenetic K-means(Sm, K'); //executing Genetic Kmeans, produce K' clusters and j groups.\n3. Compute\n;\n4. Choose min{Jc} as the refined initial points Zj , j [1, K']; 5. Genetic K-means(S, K'); //executing Genetic K-means again with chosen initial, producing K'mediods. 6. Repeat\nCombining two near clusters into one cluster, and recalculate the new center generated by two centers merged.\n7. Until the number of clusters reduces into k //Merging (K' +K) End\nOutlier Detection using Indegree Number (ODIN)[15] is a local density-based outlier detection algorithm. Local density based scheme can be used in cluster thinning. Outlier removal algorithm can remove vectors from the overlapping regions between clusters, if the assumption holds that the regions are of relatively low density. Higher density is found near the cluster centroid. An obvious approach to use outlier rejection in the cluster thinning is as follows: (i) eliminate outliers (ii) cluster the data using any method.\nIn ODIN, the outliers are defined using a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) graph, in which every vertex represents a data vector, and the edges are pointers to neighbouring k vectors. The weight of an edge eij is ||xi \u2013 xj||. In ODIN, the outlyingness of xi is defined as:\n1\n( ) 1 iO ind x  \nWhere ind(xi) is the indegree of the vertex xi, i.e. the number of edges pointing to xi. In the first step of ODIN, a kNN graph is created for the dataset X. Then, each vertex is visited to check if its outlyingness is above threshold T. An algorithm shows the ODIN method as follows:\nAlgorithm ODIN+K-means (k, T):\nOutlier removal clustering (ORC)[16], it consists of two consecutive stages, which are repeated several times. In the first stage, K-means algorithm is performed until convergence, and in the second stage, the outlyingness factor is assigned for each vector. Factor depends on its distance from the cluster centroid. Then algorithm iterations start, with first finding the vector with maximum distance to the partition centroid dmax:\nmax max , 1,...,i i pid x c i N  \nThe outlyingness of a vector xi is defined as follows:\nmax\ni pi\ni\nx c O\nd\n \nAn algorithm shows the ORC method as follows: Algorithm ORC (I, T)"}, {"heading": "4. PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "The ability to detect outliers can be improved using a combined perspective from outlier detection and cluster identification. Unlike the traditional clustering-based methods, the proposed algorithm provides much efficient outlier detection and data clustering capabilities in the presence of outliers. This approach is based on filtering of the data after clustering process. The purpose of our method is not only to produce data clustering but at the same time to find outliers from the resulting clusters.\nThe algorithm of our outlier detection method is divided into two stages. The first stage carried out using IGK process and the second stage removing outliers according to a chosen threshold.\nSo, the proposed method is like the ORC method except in the first stage, ORC was applying K-means. But K-means suffers from some drawbacks such as K-means is sensitive to initial choice of cluster centers, the clustering can be very different by starting from different centers, K-means can\u2019t deal with massive data, K-means is sensitive with respect to outliers and noise. Hence, we employed IGK instead K-means which has many advantages as we described before.\nIn our method, the outliers are defined using outlyingness factor that assigned for each vector. Factor depends on its distance from the cluster centroid. Outlyingness factors for each vector are defined as follows:\nmax\ni pi\ni\nx c O\nd\n \nWhere xi is the vector and dmax is the maximum distance between vector xi and the partition centroid cpi and defined as follows:\nmax max , 1,...,i i pid x c i N  \nWe see that all outlyingness factors of the dataset are\nnormalized to the scale [0, 1]. The greater value, the more\nlikely the vector is an outlier. An example of dataset clustered\nin three clusters and calculated outlyingness factors is shown\nin Figure 1.\nBegin {ind(xi)|i = 1, ...,N}\u2190Calculate kNN graph fori\u21901,...,N do\nOi\u21901/(ind(xi) + 1) ifOi> T then X\u2190X \\ {xi} end if\nend for (C,P) \u2190K-means(X) //C is the centers and P is the partition.

Threshold is set by user in range between 0 and 1. At the end of each iteration, IGK is run with the previous C as the initial codebook, so new solution will be a fine-tuned solution for the reduced dataset. By setting the threshold to T < 1, at least one vector is removed. Thus, increasing the number of iterations and decreasing the threshold will in effect remove more vectors from the dataset, possibly all vectors.\nThe performance of proposed method for 10 iterations with threshold 0.9 is illustrated in Figure 2. In the original data, there are the most distant vectors from centroids, some of such furthest vectors are labeled by arrows in Figure 2 on the left. The algorithm proceeds by removing the furthest vectors from all partitions.Figure 2 on right demonstrates the resulting data after the algorithm."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We run experiments on three synthetic datasets denoted as A1, A2 and A3 [17], which are shown in Figure 3 and summarized in Table 1 with threshold equal to 0.9 and number of iterations equal to 10, where N is number of examples and M is no of clusters.\nFig3: Datasets, A1 (left), A2 (center) and A3 (right).\nThe mean square error (MSE) used to differentiate the difference between outlier points. The distance between the estimated centroids and the true centroids has been calculated to computes the error.\nFigure 4, shows that the error is decreasing very fast when the threshold becomes bigger, thus removing more and more number of objects implies to decrease the distance between the points and cluster centroids.\nBegin C \u2190IGK for j\u2190 1,...,I do //I is no of iterations\ndmax\u2190 maxi{||xi \u2212 cpi||} for i \u2190 1,...,N do\nOi = ||xi\u2013cpi||/dmax ifOi> T then\nX \u2190 X \\ {xi}\nend if end for (C,P) \u2190IGK(X,C) //C is the centers and P is the partition.\nend for End\nIn Table 2, we show the smallest MSE between original centroids and those obtained by using K-means, ORC and proposed method. It is obvious that the MSE obtained by the proposed method for all data set (A114.77, A2 26.37, A3 800.69) is better than the calculated MSE by K-means (A1 1632.88, A2 2516.83, A3 3052.36) and ORC algorithm (A1 1311.88, A2 2138.64, A3 2470.51).\nIn summary, the above experimental results on A1, A2, and A3 datasets show that the proposed algorithm can identify outliers more successfully than existing algorithms."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed to integrate outlier removal into clustering for nonparametric model estimation. The proposed method was also compared with the standard Kmeans without outlier removal, and a simple approach in which outlier removal precedes the actual clustering. The proposed method employs both clustering and outlier discovery to improve estimation of the centroids of the generative distribution.\nThe experimental results show that the proposed method can identify outliers more successfully than existing algorithms and indicate that our method has a lower error on datasets with overlapping clusters than the competing methods."}, {"heading": "7.
