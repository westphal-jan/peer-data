Uncertain data in these fields could be caused by complexities and difficulties in classical mathematical modeling. To avoid difficulties in dealing with uncertainties, many tools have been studied by researchers. Some of these tools are fuzzy sets [18], rough sets [16] and intuitionistic fuzzy sets [1]. Fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets are characterized by membership functions, membership and non-membership functions, respectively. In some real life problems for proper description of an object in uncertain and ambiguous environment, we need to handle the\nindeterminate and incomplete information. But fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets don\u2019t handle the indeterminant and inconsistent information. Samarandache [13] defined the notion of neutrosophic set which is a mathematical tool for dealing with problems involving imprecise and indeterminant data.\nMolodtsov introduced concept of soft sets [9] to solve complicated problems and various types of uncertainties. In [10], Maji et al. introduced several operators for soft set theory: equality of two soft sets, subsets and superset of soft sets, complement of soft set, null soft sets and absolute soft sets. But some of these definitions and their properties have few gaps, which have been pointed out by Ali et al.[12] and Yang [17]. In 2010, C\u0327ag\u0306man and Enginog\u0306lu [5] made some modifications the operations of soft sets and filled in these gap. In 2014, C\u0327ag\u0306man [4] redefined soft sets using the single parameter set and compared definitions with those defined before.\nMaji [11] combined the concept of soft set and neutrosophic set together by introducing a new concept called neutrosophic soft set and gave an application of neutrosophic soft set in decision making problem. Recently, the properties and applications on the neutrosophic sets have been studied increasingly [2, 3, 7, 8].The propose of this paper is to fill the gaps of the Maji\u2019s neutrosophic soft set [11] definition and operations redefining concept of neutrosophic soft set and operations between neutrosophic soft sets. First, we present Maji\u2019s definitions and operations and we verify that some propositions are incorrect by a counterexample. Then based on C\u0327ag\u0306man\u2019s [4] study we redefine neutrosophic soft sets and their operations. Also, we investigate properties of neutrosophic soft sets operations. Finally we present an application of a neutrosophic soft set in decision making."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we will recall the notions of neutrosophic sets [15] and soft sets [9]. Then, we will give some properties of these notions. Throughout this paper X , E and P (X) denote initial universe, set of parameters and power set of X , respectively.\nDefinition 2.1 [15] A neutrosophic set A on the universe of discourse X is defined as\nA = { \u3008x, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)\u3009 : x \u2208 X }\nwhere TA, IA, FA : X \u2192] \u22120, 1+[ and \u22120 \u2264 TA(x) + IA(x) + FA(x) \u2264 3 +. From philosophical point of view, the neutrosophic set takes the value from real standard or non-standard subsets of ]\u22120, 1+[. But in real life application\nin scientific and engineering problems it is difficult to use neutrosophic set with value from real standard or non-standard subset of ]\u22120, 1+[. Hence we consider the neutrosophic set which takes the value from the subset of [0, 1].\nDefinition 2.2 [9] Let consider a nonempty set A, A \u2286 E. A pair (F,A) is called a soft set over X, where F is a mapping given by F : A \u2192 P (X).\nExample 2.3 Let X = {xl, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8} be the universe which are eight houses and E = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6} be the set of parameters. Here, ei (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) stand for the parameters \u201cmodern\u201d, \u201cwith parking\u201d, \u201c expensive\u201d, \u201c cheap\u201d, \u201c large\u201d and \u201c near to city\u201d respectively. Then, following soft sets are described respectively Mr. A and Mr. B who are going to buy\nF = { (e1, {x1, x3, x4}), (e2, {x1, x4, x7, x8}), (e3, {x1, x2, x3, x8}) } G = { (e2{x1, x3, x6}), (e3, X), (e5, {x2, x4, x4, x6}) } .\nFrom now on, we will use definitions and operations of soft sets which are more suitable for pure mathematics based on study of C\u0327ag\u0306man [4].\nDefinition 2.4 [4] A soft set F over X is a set valued function from E to P (X). It can be written a set of ordered pairs\nF = { (e, F (e)) : e \u2208 E } .\nNote that if F (e) = \u2205, then the element (e, F (e)) is not appeared in F . Set of all soft sets over X is denoted by S.\nDefinition 2.5 [4] Let F,G \u2208 S. Then,\ni. If F (e) = \u2205 for all e \u2208 E, F is said to be a null soft set, denoted by \u03a6.\nii. If F (e) = X for all e \u2208 E, F is said to be absolute soft set, denoted by X\u0302.\niii. F is soft subset of G, denoted by F \u2286\u0303G, if F (e) \u2286 G(e) for all e \u2208 E.\niv. F = G, if F \u2286\u0303G and G\u2286\u0303F .\nv. Soft union of F and G, denoted by F \u222a\u0303G, is a soft set over X and defined by F \u222a\u0303G : E \u2192 P (X) such that (F \u222a\u0303G)(e) = F (e) \u222aG(e) for all e \u2208 E.\nvi. Soft intersection of F and G, denoted by F \u2229\u0303G, is a soft set over X and defined by F \u2229\u0303G : E \u2192 P (X) such that (F \u2229\u0303G)(e) = F (e) \u2229G(e) for all e \u2208 E.\nvii. Soft complement of F is denoted by F c\u0303 and defined by F c\u0303 : E \u2192 P (X) such that F c\u0303(e) = X \\ F (e) for all e \u2208 E.\nExample 2.6 Let us consider soft sets F ,G in the Example 2.3. Then, we have\nF \u222a\u0303G = {\n(e1, {x1, x3, x4}), (e2, {x1, x3, x4, x6, x7, x8}),\n(e3, X), (e5, {x2, x4, x4, x6}) }\nF \u2229\u0303G = { (e2{x1}), (e3, {x1, x2, x3, x8}) }\nF c\u0303 = {\n(e1, {x2, x5, x6, x7, x8}), (e2, {x2, x3, x5, x6}), (e3, {x4, x5, x6, x7}), (e4, X), (e5, X), (e6, X) } .\nDefinition 2.7 [11] Let X be an initial universe set and E be a set of parameters. Consider A \u2282 E. Let P (X) denotes the set of all neutrosophic sets of X. The collection (F,A) is termed to be the soft neutrosophic set over X, where F is a mapping given by F : A \u2192 P (X).\nFor illustration we consider an example.\nExample 2.8 Let X be the set of houses under consideration and E is the set of parameters. Each parameter is a neutrosophic word or sentence involving neutrosophic words. Consider E = {beautiful, wooden, costly, very costly, moderate, green surroundings, in good repair, in bad repair, cheap, expensive}. In this case, to define a neutrosophic soft set means to point out beautiful houses, wooden houses, houses in the green surroundings and so on. Suppose that, there are five houses in the universe X given by, U = {h1, h2, h3, h4, h5} and the set of parameters A = {e1, e2, e3, e4}, where e1 stands for the parameter \u2019beautiful\u2019, e2 stands for the parameter \u2019wooden\u2019, e3 stands for the parameter \u2019costly\u2019 and the parameter e4 stands for \u2019moderate\u2019.

definitions and properties in study of Maji [11] on neutrosophic soft sets. We then give a few notes on his study. Next, based on \u00c7a\u011fman [4], we redefine the notion of neutrosophic soft set and neutrosophic soft set operations to make more functional. By using these new definitions we construct a decision making method and a group decision making method which selects a set of optimum elements from the alternatives. We finally present examples which shows that the methods can be successfully applied to many problems that contain uncertainties.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
