"human crisis threat management is a complex problem raised earlier by regarding the current scientific community currently. though decision support systems are inherently a sufficiently suitable effective solution for maintaining such issues, technically they so are indeed able to occasionally help emergency managers to prevent risks and equipped to manage crisis in ordinary emergency situations. however, they should be often enough flexible trained and adaptive in order, to be reliable to solve moderately complex problems that are plunged only in dynamic flooding and unpredictable environments. the approach we propose in this paper critically addresses facing this challenge. we expose here a modelling value of critical information \u00ab for covering an existent emergency environment issue and an approximate architecture of a stable multiagent decision handling support holding system \u00bb that currently deals with these information in order to prevent and to manage the occur of a crisis occurring in dangerous emergency - situations. we focus on the first level representation of the system mechanism which intends to perceive and interpret to reflect the evolution model of preventing the critical current situation. further the general approach and experimentations are extensively provided thus here.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 31 May 2014 09:57:02 GMT

Decision support systems are a suitable solution for such issues, they are indeed able to help emergency managers to prevent and to manage crisis in emergency situations. However, they should be enough flexible  and adaptive  in  order  to  be  reliable   to  solve complex problems that are plunged in dynamic and unpredictable environments. The  approach  we  propose   in   this   paper   addresses   this   challenge.  We expose here a modelling of information for an emergency environment and an architecture of a multiagent decision support  system that  deals with   these   information   in  order   to  prevent   the  occur  of  a  crisis  or   to manage  it   in  emergency situations.  We focus  on   the   first   level  of   the system mechanism which intends to perceive and to reflect the evolution of the current situation. The general approach and experimentations are provided here.", "creator": "Writer"}}}
