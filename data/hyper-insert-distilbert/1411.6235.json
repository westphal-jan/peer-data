The objective of clustering is to partition the original data points into a number of groups so that the data points within the same cluster are close to each other while those in different clusters are far away from each other [7] [8] [9] [10].\nAmong various approaches for clustering, K-means and mincut are two most popular choices in reality because of their simplicity and effectiveness [11]. The general procedure of traditional K-means (TKM) is to randomly initialize c clustering centers, assign each data point to its nearest cluster and compute a new clustering center iteratively. Some researchers claim that the curse of dimensionality may deteriorate the performance of TKM [12]. A straightforward solution of this problem is to project the original dataset to a low-dimensional subspace by dimensionality reduction, for example, PCA, before performing TKM. Discriminative analysis has been shown effective in enhancing clustering performance [12] [13] [14]. Motivated by this fact, discriminative k-means (DKM) [15] is proposed to incorporate discriminative analysis and clustering into a single framework to formalize the clustering as a trace maximization problem.\nBy contrast, the min-cut clustering is realized by constructing a weighted undirected graph and then partitioning its vertices into two sets so that the total weight of the set of edges with endpoints in different sets is minimized [16] [17]. Among several graph clustering methods, min-cut tends to provide more balanced clusters as compared to other graph clustering criterion. As the within-cluster similarity in min-cut method is explicitly maximized, solving the min-cut clustering problem is nontrivial. The main difficulty lies\n\u2022 Xiaojun Chang and Yi Yang are with School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Australia.

Thus, to make this problem tractable, researchers proposed to relax the constraint.\nAlthough k-means and min-cut have achieved promising performance in many applications, they have certain limit.Given that the distribution of the data points is balanced, one would expect the clustering result to reflect such balance. That being said, a clustering algorithm shall avoid partitioning a minority of data points into a cluster. Nonetheless, both K-means and mincut, as well as some other similar clustering algorithms, do not guarantee balanced clustering result. In many real world data mining applications, the data from each cluster are about the same. For example, the male and female populations in the same age range cannot be very different. Therefore, for those data which are equally distributed, it is more reasonable to explicitly guarantee the clustering results balanced.\nMotivated by the limit of k-means and min-cut for handling balanced data, we propose to design a balanced clustering algorithm. Specifically, the exclusive lasso proposed by Zhou et al. [18] has been exploited in our approach to fulfill such purpose. The exclusive lasso was originally used for feature selection across multiple tasks. It models the scenario when variables in the same group compete with each other. With exclusive lasso, if one feature in a group is given a large weight, it tends to assign small or even zero weights to the other features in the same group. Suppose that the exclusive lasso is applied on a bunch of data points across multiple categories. In a similar manner, we introduce a competition among different categories for the same data point. If more data points are clustered into one category, other categories would get fewer data points. The exclusive lass, thus in a sense, measures the balance degree of the clustering result. The smaller value the exclusive lasso obtains, the more balanced the clustering result is. With such insight, we formulate our clustering approach based on minimizing the exclusive lasso. In this paper, we particularly incorporate the exclusive lasso into k-means clustering and min-cut clustering, aiming to promote these two mainstream clustering approaches with stronger ability of attaining balanced clusters.\nThe major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n2 1) We leverage the exclusive lasso to introduce a competition among different categories for the same data point, thus enhancing the balance of the clustering result. 2) The exclusive lasso is particularly tailored for k-means and min-cut. Thus, these two mostly used clustering approaches are able to achieve more balanced clustering result. 3) The proposed algorithms are non-smooth and difficult to optimize. We propose a new iterative solution to solve the problems.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. After revisiting the related work on k-means, min-cut and the exclusive lasso in Section 2, we detail the proposed balanced k-means and mincut algorithms in Section 3. Extensive experiments are given in Section 4 and Section 5 concludes this paper."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "In this section, we briefly review the research on k-means, min-cut and the exclusive lasso.\n2.1 The Classical K-means\nAs one of the most efficient clustering algorithms, k-means clustering has been widely applied to real-world applications. The centroids of clusters are utilized to characterize the data. The objective of k-means is to minimize the sum of the squared errors defined by:\nJk = K\u2211\nk=1\n\u2211\ni\u2208Ck\n\u2016xi \u2212mk\u2016 2, (1)\nwhere X = (x1, . . . , xn) denotes the data matrix and mk =\u2211 i\u2208Ck\nxi/nk is the centroid of a cluster Ck of nk data points. Previous work [19] has shown that H-orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is equivalent to relaxed k-means clustering. Thus, k-means clustering can be reformulated using the clustering indicator as follows:\nmin F,G\n\u2016X \u2212HFT \u20162F\ns.t. Gik \u2208 {0, 1}, K\u2211\nk=1\nHik = 1, \u2200i = 1, 2, . . . , n (2)\nwhere X \u2208 Rd\u00d7n is the input data matrix with n data represented by d-dimensional features; F \u2208 Rd\u00d7K is the clustering indicator matrix; H \u2208 Rn\u00d7K is the clustering assignment matrix and each row of H satisfies the 1-of-K coding scheme (if a data point xi is assigned to the k-th cluster then Hik = 1 and Hik = 0 otherwise). In this paper, given a matrix X = {xij}, its i-th row, j-th column are denoted as xi, xj , respectively.\nIn the literature, the classical K-means and its variants have been applied to many data mining applications. For example, Mehrdad et al. [19] propose a harmony K-means (HKM) algorithm based on harmony search optimization method and applied it to document clustering. HKM can be proved by means of finite Markov chain theory to converge to the global optimum. Zhang et al. [20] propose a new neighborhood density method for selecting initial cluster centers for K-means clustering. Deepak et al. [21] employ quantization schemes to retain the outcome of clustering operations. Although these methods get good performance, they have not considered how to achieve balanced clustering result\nwhen the given data points are evenly distributed. By contrast, we aim to develop a balanced k-means clustering algorithm that well addresses this issue."}, {"heading": "2.2 Min-Cut", "text": "The principle of min-cut is rooted in graph theory. It needs a graph based on a weight matrix W \u2208 Rn\u00d7n built from n data points {x1, . . . , xn}. The min-cut graph clustering objective function can be generalized as:\nJ = \u2211\n1\u2264p<q\u2264K\ns(Cp, Cq) + s(Cp, Cq) = K\u2211\nk=1\ns(Ck, Ck) (3)\nwhere K is the number of clusters, Ck is the k-th cluster (subgraph in graph G), Ck is the complement of a subset Ck in graph G, and for any set A and B\ns(A,B) = \u2211\ni\u2208A\n\u2211\nj\u2208B\nWij , (4)\ndi = \u2211\nj\nWij . (5)\nWe denote qk (k = 1, . . . ,K) as the cluster indicators where the i-th element of qk is set to 1 if the i-th data point xi belongs to the k-th cluster, and 0 otherwise. For example, if the data points within each cluster are adjacent,\nqk = (0, . . . , 0,\nnk\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0)T . (6)\nAfter simple mathematical deduction, we can find that\ns(Ck, Ck) = \u2211\ni\u2208Ck\n\u2211\nj\u2208Ck\nWij = q T k (D \u2212W )qk\n\u2211\ni\u2208Ck\ndi = q T k Dqk\ns(Ck, Ck) = q T k Wqk, (7)\nwhere D is a diagonal matrix with the i-th diagonal element as di. The objective function of min-cut method can therefore be reformulated as:\nJ = K\u2211\nk=1\nqTk (D \u2212W )qk (8)\nMin-Cut clustering has been applied in various applications. Wang et al. [22] propose a flexible and generalized framework for constrained spectral clustering, interpret the algorithm as finding the normalized min-cut of a labeled graph, and apply it to constrained image segmentation. Dynamic graph clustering algorithm, proposed by [23] can provide strong theoretical quality guarantee on clusters. However, none of the existing work on mincut is capable of balanced clustering when necessary, which shall be addressed by our newly proposed balanced min-cut algorithm.\n3"}, {"heading": "2.3 Exclusive Lasso", "text": "Zhou et al. propose the exclusive lasso to model the scenario when variables in the same group compete with each other. They apply it to multi-task feature selection and obtain good performance. The exclusive lasso [18] is defined as follows:\n\u2016\u03b2\u2016e =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a d\u2211\nj=1\n( m\u2211\nk=1\n\u2016\u03b2jk\u2016) 2, (9)\nwhere \u2016\u03b2\u2016e is a regularizer that controls the complexity of the combination weights.\nIn [18], the regularizer introduces an l1-norm to combine the weights for the same category used by different data points and an l2-norm to combine the weights of different categories. Since l1-norm tends to achieve a sparse solution, the construction in the exclusive lasso essentially introduces a competition among different categories for the same data points.\nIn our work, the exclusive lasso is used as a balance constraint. We will prove that the value of exclusive lasso indicates the balance degree of our clustering algorithms."}, {"heading": "3 THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM", "text": "In this section, we illustrate the proposed approach in details."}, {"heading": "3.1 Balance Constraint", "text": "Given F as a cluster indicator matrix, the exclusive lasso of F is written as\n\u2016F\u2016e =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a c\u2211\nj=1\n( n\u2211\ni=1\n\u2016fij\u2016)2. (10)\nWith simple mathematical deduction, the exclusive lasso can be rewritten as:\n\u2016F\u2016e = Tr(F T11TF ). (11)\nFrom this equation, we can observe that the value of exclusive lasso equals the square-sum of the number of data points in each class. In the following, we prove that the most balanced clustering can be achieved by minimizing the exclusive lasso.\nTheorem 1. Given n1 + n2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + nk = N and ni|ki=1 \u2265 0,\u2211k i=1 n 2 i arrives at its minimum when ni = N k .\nProof. According to the Cauchy inequality,\n(n21 + n 2 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ n 2 k)(b 2 1 + b 2 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ b 2 k)\n\u2265(a1b1 + a2b2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ akbk) 2\nLet bi|ki=1 = 1, the equality holds when n1 = n2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = nk. Hence, we can easily have the conclusion that when ni = Nk ,\u2211k\ni=1 n 2 i get its minimal value.\nAccording to the above theorem, by minimizing the exclusive lasso, each cluster will have n\nc data points. The most balanced\nclustering result is thus obtained. Hence, we use the the exclusive lasso as the balance constraint.\n3.2 Balanced k-Means\nIn the setting of clustering, given n data points {xi}|ni=1, we have a data matrix X = (x1, . . . , xn) \u2208 Rd\u00d7n. Our goal in balanced k-means is to partition {xi}|i = 1\nn into K balanced clusters among different categories.\nNoting that the exclusive lasso is capable of introducing competition among different categories, we apply the exclusive lasso to the classical k-means to obtain balanced clusters. The proposed objective function of balanced k-means is formulated as follows:\nmin F\u2208Ind\n\u2016X \u2212HFT \u20162F + \u03b3\u2016F\u2016e (12)\nBy substituting \u2016F\u2016e with (9), the objective function can be rewritten as follows:\nmin F\u2208Ind\n\u2016X \u2212HFT \u20162F + \u03b3T r(F T11TF ) (13)\nwhere F \u2208 Ind means F \u2208 Rn\u00d7K is an indicator matrix used for clustering; H \u2208 Rd\u00d7K is the clustering assignment matrix; \u03b3 is a parameter.\nThe optimal H and F would minimize the objective function value. Since it is difficult to compute the optimal H and F simultaneously, we present an iterative approach to optimize this algorithm. To be more specific, we can obtain the optimal H by fixing F by a simple linear equation. Similarly, we can get the optimal F by fixing H .\nFor a fixed F , by setting the derivative of (13) w.r.t H to zero, we obtain\nH = XF (FTF )\u22121 (14)\nThen we fix H , we update F as follows: we update one row of F each time while fixing the other rows of the prediction matrix F . Specifically, the updating of one row is realized by finding the element being 1 that results in the minimum of (13). We iterate the updating of each row until convergence as shown in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Algorithm to solve the objective function of balanced k-means Input: Data matrix X \u2208 Rd\u00d7n Output: Indicator matrix F \u2208 Rn\u00d7K\n1: Initialize the indicator matrix F randomly. 2: repeat 3: Fixing F , compute H according to H = XF (FTF )\u22121 4: Fixing H , update F as follows: Update each row of F while fixing the remaining rows.\n5: until CONVERGENCE Return: Indicator matrix F .\nComputational Analysis: The computation complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(K). Since the indicator matrix F is sparse, this inverse operation is very efficient. When sufficient computational resources are available and parallel computing is implemented, this algorithm can be solved with desired efficiency.\nConvergence Analysis: The following theorem guarantees the convergence of Algorithm 1.\nTheorem 2. Algorithm 1 decreases the objective value of Eq. (13) in each iteration.\n4 Proof. In each iteration t of Algorithm 1, according to Step 3, we know that:\nHt+1 = min F\n\u2016X \u2212HFTt \u2016 2 F + \u03b3T r(F T t 11 TFt) (15)\nThus, we have:\n\u2016X \u2212Ht+1F T t \u2016 2 F + \u03b3T r(F T t 11 TFt)\n\u2264\u2016X \u2212HtF T t \u2016 2 F + \u03b3T r(F T t 11 TFt) (16)\nAccording to step 4, we obtain:\n\u2016X \u2212HtF T t+1\u2016 2 F + \u03b3T r(Ft+111 TFt+1)\n\u2264\u2016X \u2212HtF T t \u2016 2 F + \u03b3T r(Ft11 TFt) (17)\nAdding Eq. (16) and Eq. (17), we arrive at:\n\u2016X \u2212Ht+1F T t+1\u2016 2 F + \u03b3T r(Ft+111 TFt+1)\n\u2264\u2016X \u2212HtF T t \u2016 2 F + \u03b3T r(Ft11 TFt) (18)\nwhich proves that the algorithm decreases the objective function value in each iteration.\nAccording to Theorem 2, we can see that the value of the objective function (13) decrease at each iteration of Algorithm 1. In addition, it is clear that (13) is lower bounded by 0. Therefore, Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to converge."}, {"heading": "3.3 Balanced Min-Cut", "text": "We similarly aim to cluster n data points X = {x1, . . . , xn} \u2208 R d\u00d7n into K clusters.

This may be because discriminative dimension reduction is integrated into a single framework. Thus, each cluster is more identifiable, which helps enhance the clustering performance. We can therefore conclude that discriminative information is beneficial for clustering. 2) HKM achieves the second best performance among the comparison algorithms, which indicates that most active points changing their cluster assignments at each iteration are located on or near the cluster boundaries. 3) The proposed balanced k-means always gets the best performance on all the datasets. This experimental result demonstrates that the exclusive lasso is able to pose balance constraint to k-means clustering. By minimizing the exclusive lasso, the most balanced clustering result is obtained.\n8 10^-610^-410^-210^0 10^2 10^4 10^6 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 C lu st er in g A cc ur ac y %\n\\gamma\nMincut Clustering Balanced Mincut Clustering\n(a)\n10^-610^-410^-210^0 10^2 10^4 10^6 30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nC lu\nst er\nin g\nA cc\nur ac\ny %\n\\gamma\nMincut Clustering Balanced Mincut Clustering\n(b)\n10^-610^-410^-210^0 10^2 10^4 10^6 30\n35\n40\n45\n50\nC lu\nst er\nin g\nA cc\nur ac\ny %\n\\gamma\nMincut Clustering Balanced Mincut Clustering\n(c)\n10^-610^-410^-210^0 10^2 10^4 10^6 70\n75\n80\n85\nC lu\nst er\nin g\nA cc\nur ac\ny %\n\\gamma\nMincut Clustering Balanced Mincut Clustering\n(d)\n10^-610^-410^-210^0 10^2 10^4 10^6 51\n54\n57\n60\n63\n66\n69\nC lu\nst er\nin g\nA cc\nur ac\ny %\n\\gamma\nMincut Clustering Balanced Mincut Clustering\n(e)\n10^-610^-410^-210^0 10^2 10^4 10^6 40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\nC lu\nst er\nin g\nA cc\nur ac\ny %\n\\gamma\nMincut Clustering Balanced Mincut Clustering\n(f)\n10^-610^-410^-210^0 10^2 10^4 10^6 60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\nC lu\nst er\nin g\nA cc\nur ac\ny %\n\\gamma\nMincut Clustering Balanced Mincut Clustering\n(g)\n10^-610^-410^-210^0 10^2 10^4 10^6 45 48 51 54 57 60 63 66 69 C lu st er in g A cc ur ac y %\n\\gamma\nMincut Clustering Balanced Mincut Clustering\n(h)\n10^-610^-410^-210^0 10^2 10^4 10^6 51\n54\n57\n60\n63\n66\n69\nC lu\nst er\nin g\nA cc\nur ac\ny %\n\\gamma\nMincut Clustering Balanced Mincut Clustering\n(i)\nFig. 2.

The exclusive lasso has been exploited to exert the balance constraint for introduce its ability to induce competition among different categories for the same data point. Particularly, we incorporated the exclusive lasso into k-means and min-cut clustering algorithms, which shall facilitate these two mainstream clustering algorithms to better cope with balanced data points. On the other hand, our objective functions are non-smooth and difficult to optimize. A new iterative approach is then designed to solve the problems. We have performed extensive experiments on a copious of datasets to evaluate performance of the proposed balanced k-means and balanced mincut in terms of clustering accuracy and NMI. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithms always outperform the other comparison state-of-art clustering algorithms, which validates that utilizing the exclusive lasso indeed helps achieve the most balanced clustering."}], "references": [{"title": "Data clustering: a review", "author": ["A.K.

Among various clustering approaches, the family of k-means algorithms and min-cut algorithms gain most popularity due to their simplicity and efficacy. The classical k-means algorithm partitions a number of data points into several subsets by iteratively updating the clustering centers and the associated data points. By contrast, a weighted undirected graph is constructed in min-cut algorithms which partition the vertices of the graph into two sets. However, existing clustering algorithms tend to cluster minority of data points into a subset, which shall be avoided when the target dataset is balanced. To achieve more accurate clustering for balanced dataset, we propose to leverage exclusive lasso on k-means and min-cut to regulate the balance degree of the clustering results. By optimizing our objective functions that build atop the exclusive lasso, we can make the clustering result as much balanced as possible. Extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets validate the advantage of the proposed algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
