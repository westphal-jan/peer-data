Introduction", "text": "Syllogistic inference or syllogism is a type of deductive reasoning in which all the statements involved are quantified propositions. A well-known example of a syllogism is the one shown in Table 1, where P1 denotes the major or first premise, P2 the minor or second premise, and C the conclusion.\nEmail addresses: martin.pereira@usc.es (M.

Bugar\u0301\u0131n)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier December 1, 2014\nA quantified proposition involves two main elements: a quantifier (such as all, many, 25, 25%, double. . . that of. . . ) and terms, usually interpreted as sets. In the typical binary quantified statement, the subject is the \u201crestriction\u201d of the quantifier and the predicate its \u201cscope\u201d. For instance, for P1 in the example in Table 1, human beings is the restriction and mortal is the scope of the all quantifier.\nThe classical approach to syllogism was developed by Aristotle [1], who considered four crisp quantifiers: all (A), none (E ), some (I ), and not all (O). These quantifiers are defined accordingly to the linguistic properties in the logic square of opposition (LSO) [2] shown in Figure 1.\nWith respect to the structure of inferences, the classical syllogism comprises reasoning patterns involving two premises with a term in common (the so-called middle term) and a conclusion that involves the terms that are not shared between the premises (major term and minor term). The position of the middle term in the premises allows the definition of four different structures known as figures (Table 2).\nConsidering the four crisp quantifiers and the four figures together leads to 24 correct inference schemes called Aristotelian moods. All these valid cases\nare shown in Table 3. They are described using the classical notation in which each mood is denoted by the symbols for the quantifiers involved, which are the major premise, the minor premise and the conclusion, respectively. For example, mood AAA for Figure I refers to the reasoning scheme for the example in Table 1.\nTwo alternative approaches have been used in the literature to endow the classical syllogism with more expressive capabilities: (i) addition of new crisp [3] or fuzzy [4, 5, 6] quantifiers (but preserving the number of premises) or (ii) addition of more statements to the set of premises [7] (but only considering the four classical quantifiers).\nWe focus our analysis on models that follow the first alternative, in which quantifiers are extended for inclusion of fuzzy expressions, such as many, most, a few, between approximately 25% and 30%,. . . , since this is the closest approach to classical Aristotelian models from the point of view of both syntax and set-based interpretation of the terms.\nDubois et al. [5, 8, 9] proposed a framework in which fuzzy quantifiers are represented as intervals, as shown in the example in Table 4.\nUsing earlier results [5, 8], Dubois et al. took the first step in developing a fuzzy linguistic syllogism that is closer to the Aristotelian viewpoint than other approaches [9].\nZadeh [4] defined fuzzy syllogism as \u201can inference scheme in which the major premise, the minor premise and the conclusion are propositions containing fuzzy quantifiers.\u201d Thus, fuzzy syllogism comprises two premises and a conclusion involving quantifiers that are different to those in the LSO. A typical example of Zadeh\u2019s fuzzy syllogism is shown in Table 5. The quantifier of the conclusion, Most2 := Most\u2297Most, is calculated from the quantifiers in the premises by applying the quantifier extension principle (QEP) [10], in this case using the fuzzy arithmetic product.\nClosely related to this interpretation, Yager proposed a number of syllogistic schemes that are extensions or variants of Zadeh\u2019s framework [11]. These approaches are very similar and therefore the conclusions of our analysis also directly apply to them.\nBoth approaches have been analyzed in detail in the literature [12, 13]. Spies considered all the models proposed by Zadeh from the point of view of their basic definitions [12]. These models are syllogisms with a middle term that can be categorized into two classes:\n1. Property inheritance (asymmetric syllogism): the link between the subject and the predicate of the conclusion is semantic. Thus, a term set X and a term set Z are linked via concatenation of X with a term set Y and Y with Z.\n2. Combination of evidence (symmetric syllogism): the link between the subject and the predicate of the conclusion is syntactic, not semantic.\nThus, the links between X and Z and between Y and Z are calculated separately and they are joined in the conclusion by a logic operator (conjunction/disjunction).\nHowever, neither the disadvantages that QEP presents nor their compatibility with classical syllogisms are considered. Liu and Kerre analyzed the approaches of Zadeh and Dubois et al. in depth considering their multiple dimensions [13].\nIn this study we evaluate the capability of both fuzzy frameworks to comprise and reproduce Aristotelian moods as particular (crisp) cases. We expand the analysis of Pereira-Farin\u0303a et al. [14] and describe each of the syllogistic patterns in detail in terms of both their inferences schemes and the problems that arise when considering the classical inferences patterns.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes the reasoning patterns of Dubois et al. Section 3 analyzes the behavior of Zadeh\u2019s patterns. In Section 4, we summarize our conclusions and propose future work."}, {"heading": "2. Interval syllogistics: the Dubois et al. framework", "text": "Dubois and co-workers proposed an approach to syllogistic reasoning that is based on the interpretation of linguistic quantifiers as intervals; that is, a quantifier Q = [ q, q ] , where q denotes the lower bound and q denotes the upper bound [5, 8]. Since this model focuses on managing proportional quantifiers (such as most, many, some, between 25% and 34%,. . . ) we have that q, q \u2208 [0, 1]. An illustrative example of this type of syllogistic reasoning is shown in Table 4.\nThis interval approach and the Aristotelian approach have methodological differences. Aristotle manages and proves all his moods using natural logic, which involves using natural language as a logic language [7]. The approach of Dubois et al. is based on maximization and minimization of an interval (associated with the conclusion) according to other intervals given by the premises. We analyze this approach by dividing it into two parts: (i) the quantification framework; and (ii) the theory of inference."}, {"heading": "2.1.

Imprecise quantifiers: quantifiers whose values are not precisely known but have precise bounds; for example, between 25% and 50% of students are young and less than 70% of young people are blond.

Precise quantifiers: quantifiers whose values are precisely known and have precise bounds; for example, 10% of animals are mammals and 30% of young students are tall. In this case, the lower and upper bounds of the interval coincide (q = q).\n3. Fuzzy quantifiers: quantifiers whose bounds are ill defined and are imprecise and fuzzy; for example, most Spanish cars are new and a few elephants are pets. Fuzzy quantifiers are represented using a fuzzy number defined through the usual four-point trapezoidal representation\nQi = { q\u2217i, qi, qi, q \u2217 i } , where SUPQi := [q\u2217i, q \u2217 i ] represents the support\nof Qi and KERQi := [ q i , qi ] its core."}, {"heading": "2.2. Theory of inference of Dubois et al.", "text": "The calculation procedure is based on minimization and maximization of the quantifier in the conclusion. This quantifier can be modeled as an interval or a as a trapezoidal function and is calculated by taking the quantifiers of the premises as restrictions. The main aim is to obtain the most favorable and most unfavorable proportions among the terms of the conclusion according to the proportions expressed in the premises.\nFrom an operational point of view, researchers deal with the previously indicated pair of intervals SUPQi and KERQi . Letting A,B and C be the labels of the term sets and Q1, Q \u2032 1, Q2, Q \u2032 2, Q and Q\n\u2032 the quantifiers, which can be precise, imprecise or fuzzy, three different reasoning schemes or patterns are proposed. We refer in more detail to Pattern I, since this has the same syntactical structure as the classical Aristotelian figures."}, {"heading": "2.2.1. Pattern I", "text": "Table 6 (left) shows the linguistic expression of this pattern for the three term sets A, B and C, where Q1 denotes the quantifier of the first premise and Q\u20321 its converse, Q2 denotes the quantifier of the second premise and Q \u2032 2 its converse, and Q and Q\u2032 denote quantifiers for the conclusions. Table 6 (right) shows an illustrative example of this pattern.\nFig. 2 shows a graphic representation of the Pattern I syllogistic scheme. The circles denote term sets A,B and C; arrows with solid lines denote the\nlinks between two term sets in a premise, where Qi is the quantifier for that premise; arrows with discontinuous lines denote the links between two term sets in the conclusion, where Q is the quantifier for the conclusion.\nPattern I is an asymmetric syllogism since the link between the subject (A) and the predicate (C) of the conclusion is via concatenation of A with B and B with C. It is relevant to note that the links among all three predicates involved have to be fully known (i.e., the relationships between A and B and vice versa and between B and C and vice versa are needed to infer as a conclusion the relationships between A and C and vice versa).\nFor precise quantifiers, the quantifier of the conclusion Q := [ q, q ] is\ncalculated from Q1 := [ q1, q1 ] and Q2 := [ q2, q2 ] and the corresponding Q\u20321\nand Q\u20322 using the following expressions: 1\nq = q1\u00b7max (\n0, 1\u2212 1\u2212 q2 q\u20321\n) (1)\nq = min ( 1, 1\u2212 q1 +\nq1\u00b7 q2 q\u20321 , q1\u00b7 q2 q\u20321\u00b7 q\u20322 , q1\u00b7 q2 q\u20321\u00b7 q\u20322\n[1\u2212 q\u20322 + q1] ) .

Other patterns", "text": "Dubois et al. proposed other reasoning schemes based on three terms [8]. Pattern II involves two linguistic expressions (Table 7) called the general version and the particular version. The main difference between them is the information available for the set of premises. The general version is applied when the information available for the terms is enough to complete the six premises; the particular version can be used when the information available allows completion of four corresponding statements. Table 8 shows an illustrative example of a particular Pattern II.\n1Calculation of Q\u2032 is identical. For details of the proof, refer to [5, 8].\nPattern III has also two linguistic versions (Table 9). The differences between them are the same as for Pattern II, although the number of premises changes: the general Pattern III has the same six premises but the particular one has two. Table 10 shows an example of a particular Pattern III.\nWe can observe from the linguistic schemes for both patterns that they have a symmetric-type structure [12]; that is, the core of the reasoning process is the and logic operator. Therefore, they do not share but extend the Aristotelian inference scheme."}, {"heading": "2.3. Comparison of the Dubois et al. and Aristotelian syllogistics", "text": "Patterns II and III of Dubois et al. cannot be considered for comparison with the Aristotelian framework, since their structure is in fact a syntactical extension of the classical approach and therefore it cannot be used to reproduce classical syllogisms. Nevertheless, Pattern I can be considered for comparison, since it is an asymmetric syllogism, as are all the Aristotelian moods.\nRegarding the capability of Pattern I to reproduce the four classical figures, only Figure I is compatible, as shown in Table 11, when we take into account the conclusion Q, because of the position of the middle term. As a consequence, even though the classical Figures II, III and IV fit this approach from a syntactical point of view, they cannot be modeled within this framework.\nPattern Major premise Minor premise\nFigure I Subject Predicate\nFigure II Predicate Predicate\nFigure IV Predicate Subject Pattern I Subject Predicate\nTable 11: Position of the middle term in the Aristotelian figures and Pattern I.\nAAA EAE AII EIO AAI EAO Pattern I Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nTable 12: Behaviour of Pattern I with respect to the six moods in Figure I.\nThis limits the scope of this model and therefore comparison with the six Aristotelian moods in Figure I.

Zadeh\u2019s quantification framework", "text": "Two linguistic quantifier types are described in this framework: absolute (around five, many, some,. . . ) and proportional (many, more than a half, most,. . . ). Thus, for instance, in \u201caround ten students are blond\u201d, around ten is an absolute quantifier because it denotes the absolute quantity ten; in \u201cmost students are blond\u201d, most is a proportional quantifier because it refers to a proportional quantity relative to the cardinality of the set denoted by the subject (\u201cstudents\u201d). Some linguistic quantifiers (e.g. some) can be either absolute or proportional, depending on the context.\nZadeh interpreted linguistic quantifiers as fuzzy numbers [10]. Therefore, absolute quantifiers are identified with absolute fuzzy numbers and proportional quantifiers with proportional fuzzy numbers.\nThe procedure proposed for combining fuzzy numbers with the corresponding fuzzy sets represented in the properties is the well-known \u03a3Count scalar cardinality for fuzzy sets [10, 15]. It is relevant to note that the Aristotelian approach and Zadeh\u2019s approach exhibit methodological differences. As mentioned in Section 2, Aristotle manages and proves all his moods using natural logic [7], while Zadeh\u2019s inference process is based on fuzzy arithmetic, since the linguistic quantifiers are interpreted as fuzzy numbers.2"}, {"heading": "3.2. Zadeh\u2019s theory of inference", "text": "Zadeh\u2019s approach manages the usual quantified statements \u201cQ As are Bs\u201d, where Q is a proportional fuzzy number (equivalent to the corresponding linguistic proportional quantifier) and A and B (fuzzy or crisp) sets. According to the general scheme shown in Table 13, they can only be combined into inferences with two premises and a conclusion.\n2Liu and Kerre discuss the most relevant problems generated by the use of QEP and fuzzy arithmetic in Zadeh\u2019s framework [13].\nThe inference process is based on QEP, which establishes that:\nif C = f(P1;P2; . . . ;Pn), then Q = \u03c6f (Q1;Q2; . . . ;Qn), (3)\nwhere C is the conclusion, P1;P2; . . . ;Pn are the premises, f is a function, Q is the quantifier of the conclusion, Q1;Q2; . . . ;Qn are the quantifiers of the premises and \u03c6f is an extension of f obtained using the extension principle.\nThe main idea of QEP is to apply the extension principle to f to obtain a fuzzy function \u03c6f that can be directly applied to the corresponding fuzzy numbers. Since fuzzy numbers are managed, the corresponding arithmetic operations must be performed using fuzzy arithmetic.\nNow we analyze each of the syllogistic inference patterns proposed by Zadeh that emerge from the general pattern (Table 13). We focus on patterns that have the same syntactical structure as the classical Aristotelian figures: multiplicative chaining and major premise reversibility chaining."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Multiplicative chaining", "text": "Table 14 (left) shows the typical linguistic expression for the multiplicative chaining (MC) reasoning pattern [4]. In this syllogistic pattern, Q1 denotes the quantifier of the first premise, Q2 the quantifier of the second premise and Q the quantifier of the conclusion. Table 14 (right) presents an example of use of this pattern.\nFig. 3 presents a graphic representation of MC syllogism. Three terms are involved that play the following roles: A and C constitute the conclusion, where A is the subject and C is the predicate, and B is the \u201clink\u201d between these two terms that makes it possible to infer a coherence conclusion. Since\nthe terms of the conclusion are \u201cchained\u201d by a middle term, this pattern is called a chaining pattern.\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that there is a constraint between A and B; that is, B \u2286 A, i.e. \u00b5B (ui) \u2264 \u00b5A (ui) , ui \u2208 U, i = 1, . . .. This constraint can be expressed as an additional quantified statement: \u201call Bs as As\u201d. This constraint is relevant because it allows us to know the distribution of the elements in the sets A and B; without this information, the conclusion cannot be calculated.\nTaking all the previous considerations into account, the procedure for calculating the conclusion is shown in Equation (4), where \u2297 denotes a fuzzy product and thus the chaining pattern is multiplicative."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Major premise reversibility (MPR) chaining", "text": "Table 15 (left) shows the general structure of the MPR syllogistic pattern, where Q1 denotes the quantifier of the first premise, Q2 the quantifier of the second premise and Q the quantifier of the conclusion. Table 15 (right) presents an example of the use of this pattern.\nFig. 4 is a graphic representation of the structure of the MPR chaining reasoning pattern [4]. We can consider this model as a variant of the MC pattern in Section 3.2.1 where the constraint \u201cB \u2286 A\u201d is substituted by the reversibility of the first premise; i.e., \u201cQ1 As are Bs\u2194 Q1 Bs are As\u201d. Zadeh points out that this semantic equivalence is approximate rather than exact; the calculation of how \u201capproximate\u201d it can be remains a nontrivial open question [16].\nNevertheless, there is a remarkable obstacle for this constraint. For proportional quantifiers, it does not hold that a quantified sentence (e.g., \u201cmost American cars are big\u201d) and another sentence with the arguments interchanged (\u201cmost big cars are American\u201d) are semantically equivalent. It is true, when talking about absolute quantifiers, that such semantic equivalence holds (e.g., \u201caround a hundred thousand American cars are big\u201d is semantically equivalent to \u201caround a hundred thousand big cars are American\u201d).\nThe procedure for calculating the conclusion, shown in Equation (5), involves fuzzy addition (\u2295) and subtraction ( ).\nq \u2265 max (0, q1 \u2295 q2 1) .

Other patterns", "text": "Apart from the models described above, Zadeh proposed an asymmetric reasoning scheme (intersection/product, Table 16) and two symmetric schemes (antecedent conjunction/disjunction, Table 17; consequent conjunction/disjunction, Table 18).\nThe difference between the antecedent and consequent patterns lies in the position of the logic operator in the conclusion: if it occurs for the subject,\nwe obtain the antecedent pattern (and for the conjunction; or for the disjunction); if it occurs for the predicate, we obtain the consequent pattern (as in the previous pattern, the and operator is used for the conjunction and or for the disjunction)."}, {"heading": "3.3. Comparison of Zadeh\u2019s and Aristotelian syllogistics", "text": "We focus the analysis on the capability of Zadeh\u2019s framework to manage and reproduce Aristotelian syllogistics. First, it is worth noting that all the moods are of the property inheritance type (asymmetric syllogisms); therefore, the structure of Zadeh\u2019s symmetric syllogistic patterns is not adequate. Furthermore, the intersection/product scheme involves logic operations in the second premise and the conclusion that do not appear in the classical moods. As a consequence, none of the previously indicated patterns can be considered for this analysis.\nPattern Major premise Minor premise\nFigure I Subject Predicate\nFigure II Predicate Predicate\nFigure IV Predicate Subject MC Subject Predicate MPR Subject Predicate\nTable 19: The position of the middle term in Aristotelian figures and Zadeh\u2019s MC and MPR patterns\nZadeh\u2019s patterns AAA EAE AII EIO AAI EAO\nMC No No No No No No MPR No No Yes No No No\nTable 20: Behavior of Zadeh\u2019s patterns with respect to Figure I.\nTherefore, only the MC and MPR patterns can be considered for comparison with classical syllogisms. Regarding their capability to reproduce the four classical figures, only Figure I is compatible, as shown in Table 19, because of the position of the middle term.\nAs a consequence, none of the classical Figures II, III and IV can be modeled using this approach. This limits the scope of the model and therefore comparison to the six Aristotelian moods in Figure I. Zadeh\u2019s patterns are compared with these six moods in Table 20. Only the AII mood is compatible with the MPR scheme (i.e., one mood out of 12).\nThe problem in the MC pattern is in the constraint B \u2286 A in the first premise (minor premise in Aristotelian terms), which is much too restrictive. In this set of Aristotelian moods, the converse of the minor premise in linguistic terms is, \u201csome Bs are A\u201d; that is, A\u222aB 6= \u2205; for instance, in the AII mood, B \u2286 A cannot be inferred from the statement I: some As are Bs. This condition is less restrictive than Zadeh\u2019s and therefore many of the possible inferences dismissed by Zadeh\u2019s pattern can be solved using the Aristotelian framework.\nThe MPR pattern is only valid for the AII mood since the statement and its converse in the minor premise have the same quantifier (\u201csome\u201d). For the other moods, those that include A in the minor premise present the same problem as in the MC pattern. The solution of the EIO mood, which\nis compatible, presents a problem: the value obtained for Q is 0 instead of [0, 1\u2212 ) with \u2208 (0, 1], the usual representation for the quantifier \u201cnot all\u201d in a proportional interpretation. The origin of this problem is that Zadeh\u2019s framework is not capable of managing moods involving decreasing quantifiers such as \u201cnot all\u201d.\nIn conclusion, Zadeh\u2019s approach to syllogistic reasoning is compatible with the AII mood of Aristotelian syllogism but only for the MPR scheme."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusions and future work", "text": "We have shown that the two most relevant fuzzy approaches behave very differently with regard to management of Figure I of Aristotelian syllogistics, which is one of the classical approaches to this type of reasoning. While the model of Dubois et al. is consistent with all six moods in Figure I, Zadeh\u2019s MPR scheme is only consistent for one mood out of six and his MC approach is consistent with none of the six moods. Furthermore, none of the models is compatible with the other classical Figures II, III and IV, which involve 18 moods.\nTherefore, from this point of view, the proposal of Dubois et al. can be properly considered as a plausible fuzzy extension that comprises some of the classical cases as particular instances. Therefore, this proposal could be considered as a basis for defining a more general approach to syllogistic reasoning that involves, for example, the other moods currently excluded and/or other types of quantifier used in the linguistics field [17], such as comparative (e.g., there are approximately three more tall people than blond people) and exception (e.g., all except three students are tall quantifiers)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "This work was supported in part by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (grant TIN2008-00040), the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Innovation and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF/FEDER) (grant TIN2011-29827-C02-02) and the Spanish Ministry for Education (FPU Fellowship Program).

The syllogistic reasoning scheme in the classical Aristotelian framework involves three crisp term sets and four linguistic quantifiers, for which the main support is the linguistic properties of the quantifiers. A number of fuzzy approaches for defining an approximate syllogism have been proposed for which the main support is cardinality calculus. In this paper we analyze fuzzy syllogistic models previously described by Zadeh and Dubois et al. and compare their behavior with that of the classical Aristotelian framework to check which of the 24 classical valid syllogistic reasoning patterns (called moods) are particular crisp cases of these fuzzy approaches. This allows us to assess to what extent these approaches can be considered as either plausible extensions of the classical crisp syllogism or a basis for a general approach to the problem of approximate syllogism.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
