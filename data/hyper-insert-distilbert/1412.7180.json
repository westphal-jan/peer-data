The weights of this linear combination are usually trained to maximise some automatic translation metric (e.g. BLEU) [1] using Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) [2, 3] or a variant of the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) [4, 5]. These algorithms are heavily adapted to exploit the properties of the translation search space. In this paper we introduce generic, effective, and efficient Bayesian optimisation (BO) algorithms [6, 7] for training the weights of SMT systems for arbitrary metrics that outperform both MERT and MIRA. To our knowledge this is the first application of BO in natural language processing (NLP) and our results show that their may be significant scope for using BO to tune hyperparameter in a range of NLP models.\nThe linear model popular for SMT systems [2] is parametrised in terms of a source sentence f , target translation e, feature weights wk and corresponding feature functions Hk(e,f) (including a language model, conditional translation probabilities, etc.). The best translation is selected by,\ne\u0302 = arg max e\n{ K\u2211\nk=1\nwkHk(e,f)}. (1)\nSince the translation metrics (e.g. BLEU score) can only be evaluated between the selected translations and reference translations (i.e. the standard manual translations from the parallel training data), meanwhile decoding new translations following Equation 1 is very time consuming, we cannot tune the linear weights directly as in ordinary classification tasks. The most common approach is an iterative algorithm MERT [3] which employs N-best lists (the best N translations decoded with a weight set from a previous iteration) as candidate translations C. In this way, the loss function is constructed as E(E\u0304, E\u0302) = \u2211S s=1 E(e\u0304s, e\u0302s), where e\u0304 is the reference sentence, e\u0302 is selected from\nN-best lists by e\u0302s = arg max e\u2208C\n{\u2211K k=1 wkHk(e,fs) } and S represents the volume of sentences. By\nexploiting the fact that the error surface is piece-wise linear, MERT iteratively applies line search to find the optimal parameters along the randomly chosen directions via Equation 2, generating new\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n71 80\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n2 2\nD ec\n2 01\nN-best lists until convergence (no change happened in the new N-best lists),\nw\u0302 = arg min w\n{ S\u2211\ns=1\nE ( e\u0304s, arg max\ne\u2208C\n{ K\u2211\nk=1\nwkHk(e,fs)\n})} . (2)\nHypergraph, or lattice, MERT [8, 9] aims to tackle problems caused by the lack of diversity in N-best lists. A hypergraph [10] efficiently encodes the exponential translation space explored by the beam-search translation decoder. The line search can then be carried out on the edges of the hypergraph, instead of the translations in the N-best lists. And dynamic programming is used to find the upper envelope of the hypergraph corresponding to the maximum scoring translation. Prior work [8, 9] showed that hypergraph MERT is superior to the original N-best algorithm both in speed of convergence and stability. MIRA is an online large-margin learning algorithm that applies a different strategy to MERT. It enforces a margin between high and low loss translations and enables stochastic gradient descent to be used to update parameters. A disadvantage of this approach is that it requires the global BLEU score, which is a non-linear function of local translation candidate statistics, to be approximated by a linear combination of sentence level BLEU scores.\nIn this paper, however, our BO algorithms treat the loss function as a black-box function so that we could directly query the function value without the cumbersome and inefficient work of constructing an error surface for random directions. Instead of applying BO to the whole SMT pipeline, which would require expensive decoding of new translations with every parameter set sampled, our BO algorithms only decode new translations after obtaining the best parameters on fixed N-best lists or hypergraphs. Hence our algorithms iteratively run Gaussian processes on the sub-models and only a few decoding iterations are required to reach convergence. The experiments in Section 3 illustrate the superiority of our algorithms both in translation quality and speed of convergence."}, {"heading": "2 Bayesian Optimisation Tuning Algorithms", "text": "Algorithm 1 describes our hypergraph algorithm (HG-BO). The N-best algorithm (NBL-BO) is similar to HG-BO and can be derived from Algorithm 1 by replacing the hypergraphs with N-best lists. In HG-BO, both wi and xj represent the weights of the linear model. The weights wi are used to produce the hypergraphs Hi, while xj are the weights sampled from the GP to compute the BLEU score (i.e. objective function value) for a fixed set Hi. Since Hi remains unchanged during an iteration of Bayesian optimisation, the BLEU score calculated for the fixed hypergraphs approximates the true BLEU score that would be achieved if the translation system were run with xj . This introduces some noise owing to the variance between wi and xj .\nAs depicted in Fig. 1, a key aspect of Algorithm 1 is that we place a bound (blue area) around wi and only consider samples inside this region. The sample with the highest BLEU score will then be\nwi+1 = xbest; Return wi\n0 5 10 15 20 Iteration\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\nD e v B\nLE U\nS co\nre\nMERT MIRA NBL-BO HG-BO CHG-BO\n(a) fr-en\n0 5 10 15 20 Iteration\n5\n10\n15\n20\nD e v B\nLE U\nS co\nre\nMERT MIRA NBL-BO HG-BO CHG-BO\n(b) cs-en\nFigure 2: Convergence of different models\nModel Time(h) Iteration MERT 4 5 MIRA 4 20\nNBL-BO 1.5 5 HG-BO 1.5 5 CHG-BO 2 5\nTable 2: Time consumption\nused to decode new hypergraphs for the next iteration of BO. Intuitively, to speed up convergence, we would like the search space of BO to be as large as possible. When the search space is too large, however, a sampled xj could be so far from wi that the generated translations would become unreliable thus leading to noisy BLEU measurements. HG-BO is preferable to NBL-BO as it weighs the translations directly in the hypergraphs, which encode an exponentially larger space of translations than the N-best lists, and thus noise is diminished. To further expand the translation space searched at each iteration, we present a variant cumulative hypergraph BO algorithm (CHG-BO) which combines hypergraphs from one previous and current iterations in order to trade stability and speed of convergence with memory usage.\nSimilar to MERT, our BO algorithms become less reliable when the number of features in the linear model exceeds 30. Hence, we introduce a variant of random embedding Bayesian optimisation (REMBO) [11] into our hypergraph algorithm (HG-REMBO) to tackle the large scale training problem. The original REMBO generates a random matrix A \u2208 Rh\u00d7l to map the sample x \u2208 Rh from high dimensional space to a point z \u2208 Rl in low dimensional space. The objective function to be optimised then becomes g(z) = f(Az). Instead of A, we used a regularised random matrix A\u0304 where A\u0304mn = Amn\u2016Am\u20161 and transform the objective function to g(z) = f(A\u0304z +w), where w are the weights producing the hypergraphs. w would remain constant during Bayesian optimisation. In this way, BO can be carried out in the low dimensional space and the regularisation of A ensures that each update of the weights remains in a bounded domain."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "We implemented our models using spearmint [7]1 and the cdec SMT decoder [12]2.

More details about the rules can be found in [14].\nFigure 3: Convergence of BO algorithms\nshows a particular case where the imperfect starting weights cause a violent fluctuation initially. CHG-BO quickly reaches the plateau in 5 iterations but NBL-BO dips again at the 10th iteration.\nTable 2 illustrates the efficiency of the BO algorithms. They consistently obtain a good weight set within 5 iterations, but the best one is always achieved after 7 iterations. This suggests setting the maximum number of iterations to 10 in order to ensure a good result. Our BO tuning algorithms only take advantage of multiple processors for decoding, thus there still exists some space to further improve their efficiency.\nFig. 3a and 3b indicate the comparison of development score and BO score5 at each iteration in fr-en and cs-en, which again demonstrates the advantage of CHG-BO on stability over NBL-BO and HG-BO. Fig. 3c and 3d compare the models with different bound size: b = 0.01 is able to achieve a development and test BLEU score as good as b = 0.1 with more iterations, but b = 0.5 performs worse on the test dataset. Thus too large search bound may introduce too much noise which in turn affects the translation performance.\nTable 3 shows the experiments on a large number of sparse features. We modify HG-REMBO into a two step coordinate ascent processes in order to stabilise the updates of the core default feature weights. First, we optimise the default 18 features, then we fix them and generate a regularised random matrix to update the large scale sparse features in the low dimensional space. Table 3 demonstrates that HG-REMBO is able to carry out large scale discriminative training, performing almost on par with MIRA. Although HG-REMBO loses its advantage on speed of convergence as it requires multiple runs to generate a good transformation matrix, these results illustrate the potential of applying REMBO on statistical machine translation systems."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "We introduce novel Bayesian optimisation (BO) algorithms for machine translation.
