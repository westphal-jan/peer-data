A HMM is a classifier or labeler that can assign label or class to each unit in a sequence [?]. It has been successfully utilized over several decades in many applications for processing text and speech such as Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging [?], named entity recognition [?] and speech recognition [?]. However, such works in the early part of the period are mainly based on first-order HMMs. As a matter of fact, the assumption in the first-order HMM, where the state transition and output observation depend only on one previous state, does not exactly match with the real applications [?]. Therefore, they require a number of sophistications. For example, even though the first-order HMM for POS tagging in early 1990s performs reasonably well, it captures a more limited amount of the contextual information than is available [?]. As consequence, most modern statistical POS taggers use a second-order model [?].\nUncertainty theories can be integrated in statistical models such as HMMs: The probability theory has been used to classify units in a sequence with the Bayesian model. Then, the theory of belief functions is employed to this statistical model because the fusion proposed in this theory simplifies computations of a posteriori distributions of hidden data in Markov models. This theory can provide rules to combine evidences from different sources to reach a certain level of belief [?,?,?,?,?]. Belief HMMs introduced in [?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?], use combination rules proposed in the framework of the theory of belief functions. This paper is an extension of previous ideas for second-order belief HMMs. For the current work, we focus on explaining a second-order model. However, the proposed method can be easily extended to higher-order models. ar X iv :1\n50 1.\n05 61\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 2\nJa n\n20 15\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Sections 2 and 3, we detail probabilistic HMMs for the problem of POS tagging where HMMs have been widely used. Then, we describe the first-order belief HMM in Section 4. Finally, before concluding, we propose the second-order belief HMM."}, {"heading": "2 First-order probabilistic HMMs", "text": "POS tagging is a task of finding the most probable estimated sequence of n tags given the observation sequence of v words. According to [?], a first-order probabilistic HMM can be characterized as follows:\nN The number of states in a model St = {st1,st2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7stN} at the time t. M The number of distinct observation symbols. V = {v1,v2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,vM}. A = {ai j} The set of N transition probability distributions.

Figure 1 illustrates the first-order probabilistic HMM allowing to estimate the prob-\nability of the sequence st\u22121i and s t j where ai j is the transition probability from s t\u22121 i to stj and b j(ot) is the observation probability on the state s t j. Regarding POS tagging, the number of possible POS tags that are hidden states St of the HMM is N. The number of words in the lexicons V is M. The transition probability ai j is the probability that the model moves from one tag st\u22121i to another tag s t j. This probability can be estimated using a training data set in supervised learning for the HMM. The probability of a current POS tag appearing in the first-order HMM depends only on the previous tag. In general, first-order probabilistic HMMs should be characterized by three fundamental problems as follows [?]:\n\u2013 Likelihood: Given a set of transition probability distributions A, an observation sequence O = o1,o2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,oT and its observation probability distribution B, how do we determine the likelihood P(O|A,B)? The first-order model relies on only one observation where b j(ot) = P(o j|stj) and the transition probability based on one previous tag where ai j = P(stj|s t\u22121 i ). Using the forward path probability, the likelihood \u03b1t( j)\nof a given state stj can be computed by using the likelihood \u03b1t\u22121(i) of the previous state st\u22121i as described below:\n\u03b1t( j) = \u2211 i \u03b1t\u22121(i)ai jb j(ot) (1)\n\u2013 Decoding: Given a set of transition probability distributions A, an observation sequence O = o1,o2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,oT and its observation probability distribution B, how do we discover the best hidden state sequence? The Viterbi algorithm is widely used for calculating the most likely tag sequence for the decoding problem. The Viterbi algorithm can calculate the most probable path \u03b4t( j) which contains the sequence of \u03c8t( j). It can select the path that maximizes the likelihood of the sequence as described below:\n\u03b4t( j) = max\u03b4t\u22121(i)ai jb j(ot) \u03c8t( j) = argmax\u03c8t\u22121(i)ai j\n(2)\n\u2013 Learning: Given an observation sequence O = o1,o2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,oT and a set of states S = {st1,st2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,stN}, how do we learn the HMM parameters for A and B? The parameter learning task usually uses the Baum-Welch algorithm which is a special case of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nIn this paper, we focus on the likelihood and decoding problems by assuming a supervised learning paradigm where labeled training data are already available."}, {"heading": "3 Second-order probabilistic HMMs", "text": "Now, we explain the extension of the first-order model to a trigram3 in the second-order model. Figure 2 illustrates the second-order probabilistic HMM allowing to estimate the probability of the sequence of three states st\u22122i , s t\u22121 j and s t k where ai jk is the transition probability from st\u22122i and s t\u22121 j to s t k, and bk(ot) is the observation probability on the state stk. Therefore, the second-order probabilistic HMM is characterized by three fundamental problems as follows:\n\u2013 Likelihood: The second-order model relies on one observation bk(ot). Unlike the first-order model, the transition probability is based on two previous tags where ai jk = P(stk|s t\u22122 i , s t\u22121 j ) as described below:\n\u03b1t(k) = \u2211 j \u03b1t\u22121( j)ai jkbk(ot) (3)\nHowever, it will be more difficult to find a sequence of three tags than a sequence of two tags. Any particular sequence of tags st\u22122i , s t\u22121 j , s t k that occurs in the test set may simply never have occurred in the training set because of data sparsity [?]. Therefore, a method for estimating P(stk|s t\u22122 i ,s t\u22121 j ), even if the sequence s t\u22122 i , st\u22121j , s t k never occurs, is required. The simplest method to solve this problem is to combine the trigram P\u0302(stk|s t\u22122 i ,s t\u22121 j ), the bigram P\u0302(s t k|s t\u22121 j ), and even the unigram P\u0302(stk) probabilities [?]:\nP(stk|st\u22122i ,s t\u22121 j ) = \u03bb1P\u0302(s t k|st\u22122i ,s t\u22121 j )+\u03bb2P\u0302(s t k|st\u22121j )+\u03bb3P\u0302(s t k) (4)\nNote that P\u0302 is the maximum likelihood probabilities which are derived from the relative frequencies of the sequence of tags. Values of \u03bb are such that \u03bb1+\u03bb2+\u03bb3 = 1 and they can be estimated by the deleted interpolation algorithm [?]. Otherwise, [?] describes a different method for values of \u03bb as below:\n\u03bb1 = k3 \u03bb2 = (1\u2212 k3) \u00b7 k2 \u03bb3 = (1\u2212 k3) \u00b7 (1\u2212 k2)\n(5)\n3 The trigram is the sequence of three elements, i.e. three states in our case.\nwhere k2 = log(C(st\u22121j ,s t k)+1)+1\nlog(C(st\u22121j ,s t k)+1)+2\n, k3 = log(C(st\u22122i ,s t\u22121 j ,s t k)+1)+1\nlog(C(st\u22122i ,s t\u22121 j ,s t k)+1)+2\n, and C(st\u22122i ,s t\u22121 j ,s t k) is the\nfrequency of a sequence st\u22122i ,s t\u22121 j ,s t k in the training data. Note that \u03bb1 +\u03bb2 +\u03bb3 is not always equal to one in [?]. The likelihood of the observation probability for the second-order model uses B where bk(ot) = P(ok|stk,s t\u22121 j ). \u2013 Decoding: For second-order model we require a different Viterbi algorithm. For a given state s at the time t, it would be redefined as follows [?]:\n\u03b4t(k) = max\u03b4t\u22121( j)ai jkbk(ot) where \u03b4t( j) = maxP(s1,s2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,st\u22121 = si,st = s j,o1,o2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,ot) \u03c8t(k) = argmax\u03c8t\u22121( j)ai jk where \u03c8t(k) = argmaxP(s1,s2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,st\u22121 = si,st = s j,o1,o2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,ot) (6)\n\u2013 Learning: The problem of learning would be similar to the first-order model except that parameters A and B are different.\nWith respect to performance measures, different transition probability distributions in [?] and [?] obtain 97.0% and 97.09% tagging accuracy for known words, respectively for the same data (the Penn Treebank corpus). Even though probabilistic HMMs perform reasonably well, belief HMMs can learn better under certain conditions on observations [?]."}, {"heading": "4 First-order Belief HMMs", "text": "In probabilistic HMMs, A and B are probabilities estimated from the training data.

Difference between the first-order probabilistic and belief HMMs is presented in Figure 1, the transition and observation probabilities in belief HMMs are described as mass functions. Therefore, we can replace ai j by m\u2126ta [S t\u22121 i ](S t j) and b j(ot) by m \u2126t b [ot ](S t j). The set \u2126t has been used to denote states for HMMs using belief functions [?,?]. Note that sti is the single state for probabilistic HMMs and S t i is the multi-valued state for belief HMMs. First-order belief HMMs should also be characterized by three fundamental problems as follows:\n\u2013 Likelihood: The likelihood problem in belief HMMs is not solved by likelihood, but by using the combination.

Mass functions of sets A and B are combined using the Disjunctive Rule of Combination (DRC) for the forward propagation and the Generalized Bayesian Theorem (GBT) for the backward propagation [?]. Using the forward path propagation, the mass function of a given state Stj can be computed as the combination of mass functions on the observation and the transition as described below:\nq\u2126t\u03b1 (S t j) = \u2211m\u2126t\u22121\u03b1 (St\u22121i ) \u00b7q\u2126ta [St\u22121i ](Stj) \u00b7q\u2126tb (Stj) (7)\nNote that the mass function of the given state Stj is derived from the commonality\nfunction q\u2126t\u03b1 . \u2013 Decoding: Several solutions have been proposed to extend the Viterbi algorithm to\nthe theory of belief functions [?,?,?]. Such solutions maximize the plausibility of the state sequence. In fact, the credal Viterbi algorithm starts from the first observation and estimates the commonality distribution of each observation until reaching the last state. For each state Stj, the estimated commonality distribution (q \u2126t \u03b4 (S t j)) is converted back to a mass function that is conditioned on the previous state. Then, we apply the pignistic transform to make a decision about the current state (\u03c8t(stj)):\nq\u2126t\u03b4 (S t j) = \u2211St\u22121i \u2286At\u22121 m \u2126t\u22121 \u03b4 (S t\u22121 i ) \u00b7q\u2126ta [S t\u22121 i ](S t j) \u00b7q \u2126t b (S t j) \u03c8t(stj) = argmaxSt\u22121i \u2208\u2126t\u22121 (1\u2212m \u2126t \u03b4 [S t\u22121 i ]( /0)) \u00b7Pt [S t\u22121 i ](S t j)\n(8)\nwhere At = \u222aSt\u22121j \u2208\u2126t \u03c8t(S t j) [?].\n\u2013 Learning: Instead of the traditional EM algorithm, we can use the E2M algorithm for the belief HMM [?].\nTo build belief functions from what we learned using probabilities in the previous section, we can employ the least commitment principle by using the inverse pignistic transform [?,?]."}, {"heading": "5 Second-order Belief HMMs", "text": "Like the first-order belief HMM, N, M, B and \u03c0 are similarly defined in the second-order HMM. The set A is quite different and is defined as follows:\nA = {m\u2126ta [St\u22122i ,S t\u22121 j ](S t k)} (9)\nwhere A is the set of conditional bbas to all possible subsets of states based on the two previous states. Second-order belief HMMs should also be characterized by three fundamental problems as follows:\n\u2013 Likelihood: The second-order belief model relies on one observation m\u2126tb [ot ](S t k)\nin a state Sk at time t and the transition conditional mass function based on two previous states St\u22122i and S t\u22121 j , defined by m \u2126t a [S t\u22122 i ,S t\u22121 j ](S t k). Using the forward path\npropagation, the mass function of a given state Stk can be computed as the disjunctive combination (DRC) of mass functions on the transition m\u2126ta [S t\u22122 i ,S t\u22121 j ](S t k) and the observation m\u2126tb (S t k) as described below:\nq\u2126t\u03b1 (S t k) = \u2211m\u2126t\u22121\u03b1 (St\u22121j ) \u00b7q\u2126ta [St\u22122i ,St\u22121j ](Stk) \u00b7q\u2126tb (Stk) (10)\nwhere q\u2126ta [S t\u22122 i ,S t\u22121 j ](S t k) is the commonality function derived from the conjunctive combination of mass functions of two previous transitions. The conjunctive combination is used to have the conjunction of observations on previous two states St\u22122i and St\u22121j .

Note that the mass function of the given state Stk is derived from the commonality function q\u2126t\u03b1 . We use DRC with commonality functions like in [?]. Note that the observation only on one previous state is taken into account in the firstorder belief HMM, but the conjunction of observations on two previous states is considered in the second-order belief HMM. \u2013 Decoding: We accept our assumption of the first-order belief HMM for the secondorder model. Similarly to the first-order belief HMM, we propose a solution that maximizes the plausibility of the state sequence.

This mass function is the conjunctive combination of mass functions of the two previous states.

Actually, the forward-backward algorithm in HMMs can do completely unsupervised learning. However, it is well known that EM performs poorly in unsupervised induction of linguistic structure because it tends to assign relatively equal numbers of tokens to each hidden state [?].6 Therefore, the initial conditions can be very important.
