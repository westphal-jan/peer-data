In 2010, the total amount spent on cardiovascular diseases in the United States was estimated to be $444 billion [3]. The number of deaths due to coronary artery disease in India were projected to increase from 1.591 million in the year 2000 to 2.034 million by the year 2010 [4].\nAtherosclerosis has a long asymptomatic phase with a subclinical incubation period ranging from 30 to 50 years. The physicians would like to assess the risk of the patients having a severe clinical event such as stroke or heart attack and predict the same if possible. Some of the major known risk factors that eventually lead to the development of atherosclerosis are as follows: (i) family history of premature coronary heart disease or stoke in a first degree relative under the age of 60, (ii) tobacco abuse, (iii) type II diabetes, (iv) high blood pressure, (v) left ventricular hypertrophy, (vi) high triglycerides, (vii) high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (viii) low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, (ix) high total cholesterol. Large number of factors influence the onset of atherosclerosis making it a difficult task for the physicians to diagnose in its early stages. Though main risk factors are identified, development of automated effective risk prediction models using data mining techniques becomes essential for better health monitoring and prevention of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases [5], [6]. Establishing a diagnostic procedure for early detection of atherosclerosis disease is very important as any delay would increase the risk of serious complications or even disability. Determining the conditions (risk factors) predisposing the development of atherosclerosis can lead to tests for identifying the disease in its early stages.\nThough the clinical risk factors of CHD are identified there is a need for additional understanding on the disease progression for effective management [7]. Researchers have been focusing on techniques for quantifying atherosclerosis plaque morphology, composition, mechanical forces etc., hoping for better patient screening procedures. Imaging of atherosclerotic plaques helps in both diagnosis and monitoring of the progression for future management [8], [9]. There are two modes of imaging atherosclerosis (i) invasive and (ii) non-invasive. Among the invasive methods X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging technique even though it has certain limitations in providing information on plaque composition [10]. The invasive procedures such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) [11] and angioscopy [12] help in understanding the plaque size and to a limited extent its composition. The intravascular thermography [13] aids in monitoring the changes in plaque composition and metabolism. The non-invasive procedures such as B-mode ultrasound [14], computerized tomography (CT) [15] and magar X\niv :1\n50 1.\n07 09\n3v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\n1 Ja\nn 20\n15\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [16], can provide information on plaque composition on vascular beds but they fail to throw much light on the metabolic activity of the plaque inflammatory cells. Though nuclear imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) [17] have the potential for 2D and 3D surface reconstruction of thrombus using radio labels to provide information on molecular, cellular and metabolic activity of plaques [18], they lack the required resolution, sensitivity for detection and functional assessment in medium to small size arteries found in coronary circulation.\nKeeping in view the limitations of the imaging techniques there is still a greater need for developing automated methods for predicting the risk factors of atherosclerosis disease in individuals which would be of great help in reducing the disease related deaths. Machine learning approaches have been employed in a variety of real world problems to extract knowledge from data for predictive tasks. The presence of large number of attributes in medical databases affects the decision making process as some of the factors may be redundant or irrelevant. Also, the presence of missing values and highly skewed value distributions in the attributes of medical datasets require development of new preprocessing strategies. Feature selection methods are aimed at identifying feature subsets to construct models that can best describe the dataset. The other advantages in using feature selection methods include: identifying and removing of redundant/irrelevant features [19], reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, and improving the predictive capability of the classifier. The present study attempts to identify risk factors causing atherosclerosis and the possible risk that the individuals are running at.\nIn view of the above challenges, we present the following novel features of our work:\n\u2022 identifying the missing values (MV) in the dataset and imputing them by using a newly developed nonparametric imputation procedure; \u2022 determining factors that would help in predicting the risk of developing atherosclerosis among the different groups in the community; \u2022 building a predictive model that has the capability of rendering effective prediction of risk factors in realtime. \u2022 comparing the performance of our methodology with other state-of-the-art methods used in the identification of risk factors of atherosclerosis; \u2022 estimating the time complexity and scalability of our new methodology.\nThis paper is organized as follows: A brief survey of the state-of-the-art techniques employed in predicting the risk factors and understanding the biology of atherosclerosis is discussed in Section II, while in Section III we discuss a novel methodology for predicting the clinical risk factors of atherosclerosis. The description of the datasets, experiments and results are presented in Section IV. The conclusions are placed in Section V and the discussion is deferred to Section VI."}, {"heading": "II. A BRIEF SURVEY OF STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNIQUES", "text": "In [20] a test for predicting atherosclerosis is proposed using genetic algorithm and a fitness function that depends on area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristics (ROC). In [21] a three step approach based on clustering, supervised classification and frequent itemsets search is adopted to predict if a patient can develop atherosclerosis according to the correlation between his or her habits and the social environment. Support vector machines were employed in [22] for discriminating patients between coronary and non-coronary heart disease. Supervised classifiers such as Naive Bayes (NB), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Trees (DT) utilize the associations among the attributes for predicting future cardiovascular disorders in the individuals [23]. A correlation based feature selection with C4.5 decision tree is applied [24] for risk prediction of cardiovascular disease. Recent developments in imaging methods for diagnosis have given new insights on the molecular and metabolic activity of atherosclerotic plaques [25], [16], [26]. There are many other studies wherein machine learning techniques have also been employed for predicting the risk of CHD due to atherosclerosis using ultrasound and other imaging methods [27], [28]. Community based studies help in understanding the risk factors of atherosclerosis in different social strata [29], [30].\nIn the above studies the missing values (MV) were either deleted [24], or filled with approximate values [20]. A windowing method was employed [31] for obtaining the aggregates of the attributes for imputation of MVs. These approaches would lead to biased estimates and may either reduce or exaggerate the statistical power. Methods such as logistic regression, maximum likelihood and expectation maximization have been employed for imputation of MV, but they can be applied only on data sets that are either nominal or numeric. There are other imputation methods such as knearest neighbor imputation (KNNI) [32]; k-means clustering imputation (KMI) [33]; weighted k-nearest neighbor imputation (WKNNI) [34] and fuzzy k-means clustering imputation (FKMI) [33]."}, {"heading": "III. NOVEL METHODOLOGY FOR PREDICTING RISK FACTORS OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS", "text": "The mean value imputation proposed by Sree Hari Rao and Naresh Kumar [35] can be employed only when the attribute values are normally distributed. In case of highly skewed attribute values the above method may result in biased estimates as mean value is not a true representative of a non-normal distribution. Motivated by the above issues we propose a methodology comprising of a novel nonparametric missing value imputation method that can be applied on (i) data sets consisting of attributes that are of the type categorical (nominal) and/or numeric (integer or real), and (ii) attribute values that belong to highly skewed distribution. The methodology proposed by Freud and Mason [36] ignores missing values while generating the decision tree, which renders lower prediction accuracies. In this paper we propose a new feature subset selection methodology where in, a particle optimization search (PSO) is wrapped around an alternating decision tree\n(ADT) embedded with new imputation strategy discussed in Section III-B, for generation of effective decision rules. This methodology can predict the diagnosis of CHD in real time. In fact the decision rules obtained by employing this novel methodology will be useful to diagnose other individuals based on their risk factors. We designate the present machine learning approach as predictive risk assessment of atherosclerosis (PRAA) methodology throughout this work.\nWe adopt the procedure suggested by Sree Hari Rao and Naresh Kumar [35] for building and evaluating the classification model using an ADT."}, {"heading": "A. Data Representation", "text": "A medical dataset can be represented as a set S having row vectors (R1, R2, . . . , Rm) and column vectors (C1, C2, . . . , Cn). Each record can be represented as an ordered n-tuple of clinical and laboratory attributes (Ai1, Ai2, . . . , Ai(n\u22121), Ain) for each i = 1, 2, . . . ,m where the last attribute (Ain) for each i, represents the physician\u2019s diagnosis to which the record (Ai1, Ai2, . . . , Ai(n\u22121)) belongs and without loss of generality we assume that there are no missing elements in this set. Each attribute of an element in S that is Aij for i = 1, 2, . . . ,m and j = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1 can either be a categorical (nominal) or numeric (real or integer) type. Clearly all the sets considered are finite sets."}, {"heading": "B. New Imputation Strategy", "text": "The first step in any imputation algorithm is to compute the proximity measure in the feature space among the clinical records to identify the nearest neighbors from where the values can be imputed. The most popular metric for quantifying the similarity between any two records is the Euclidean distance. Though this metric is simpler to compute, it is sensitive to the scales of the features involved. Further it does not account for correlation among the features. Also, the categorical variables can only be quantified by counting measures which calls for the development of effective strategies for computing the similarity [37]. Considering these factors we first propose a new indexing measure ICl(Ri, Rk) between two typical elements Ri, Rk for i, k = 1, 2, . . . ,m, l = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1 belonging to the column Cl of S which can be applied on any type of data, be it categorical (nominal) and/or numeric (real). We consider the following cases: Case I: Ain = Akn\nLet A denote the collection of all members of S that belong to the same decision class to which Ri and Rk belong. Based on the type of the attribute to which the column Cl belongs, the following situations arise: (i) Members of the column Cl of S i.e (A1l, A2l, . . . , Aml)\nT are of nominal or categorical or integer type: We now express A as a disjoint union of non-empty subsets of A, say B\u03b3p1l , B\u03b3p2l , . . . , B\u03b3psl obtained in such a manner that every element of A belongs to one of these subsets and no element of A is a member of more than one subset of A. That\nis A = B\u03b3p1l \u22c3 B\u03b3p2l \u22c3 , . . . , \u22c3 B\u03b3psl , in which \u03b3p1l , \u03b3p2l , . . . , \u03b3psl denote the cardinalities of the respective subsets B\u03b3p1l , B\u03b3p2l , . . . , B\u03b3psl formed out of the set A, with the property that each member of the same subset has the same first co-ordinate and members of no two different subsets have the same first co-ordinate. We define an index ICl(Ri, Rk) for each l = 1, 2, . . . , n\u2212 1\nICl(Ri, Rk) =\n{ min{\u03b3pil\u03b3 , \u03b3qkl \u03b3 }, for i 6= k;\n0, otherwise.\nwhere \u03b3pil represents the cardinality of the subset B\u03b3pil , all of whose elements have first co-ordinates Ail, \u03b3qkl represents the cardinality of that subset B\u03b3qkl , all of whose elements have first co-ordinates Akl and \u03b3 = \u03b3p1l + \u03b3p2l + . . . ,+\u03b3psl represents the cardinality of the set A. (ii) Members of the column Cl of S i.e (A1l, A2l, . . . , Aml)\nT are of real (fractional or non-integer numbers): We consider the set Pl for l = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1 which is a collection of all the members of the column Cl. We then compute the skewness measure sk(Pl) = 1 m \u2211m i=1(Ail\u2212Ail) 3\n( \u221a\n1 m \u2211m i=1(Ail\u2212Ail)2)3 where Ail denote\nthe mean of Ail for each l = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1. Define the sets Ml = {a \u2208 Pl|a \u2264 Ail, for sk(Pl) < 0} or, Ml = {b \u2208 Pl|b > Ail, for sk(Pl) \u2265 0} and similarly Nl = {a \u2208 Pl|a \u2264 Akl, for sk(Pl) < 0} or, Nl = {b \u2208 Pl|b > Akl, for sk(Pl) \u2265 0}. Let \u03c4l and \u03c1l be the cardinalities of the sets Ml and Nl respectively. Construct the index ICl(Ri, Rk),\nICl(Ri, Rk) =\n{ min{ \u03c4l\u03b3 , \u03c1l \u03b3 }, for i 6= k;\n0, otherwise.\nIn the above definition \u03b3 represents the cardinality of the set Pl.\nCase II: Ain 6= Akn Clearly Ri and Rk belong to two different decision\nclasses. Consider the subsets Pi and Qk consisting of members of S that share the same decision with Ri and Rk respectively. Clearly Pi \u22c2 Qk = \u2205. Based on the type of the attribute of the members, the following situations arise:\n(i) Members of the column Cl of S i.e (A1l, A2l, . . . , Aml)\nT are of nominal or categorical type: Following the procedure discussed in Case I item (i) we write Pl and Ql for each l = 1, 2, . . . , n\u22121 as a disjoint union of non-empty subsets of P\u03b21l , P\u03b22l , . . . , P\u03b2rl and Q\u03b41l , Q\u03b42l , . . . , Q\u03b4sl respectively in which \u03b21l, \u03b22l, . . . , \u03b2rl and \u03b41l, \u03b42l, . . . , \u03b4sl indicate the cardinalities of the respective subsets. We define the indexing measure between the two records Ri and Rk as\nICl(Ri, Rk) =\n{ max{ \u03b2rl\u03b4sl+\u03b2rl , \u03b4sl \u03b4sl+\u03b2rl\n}, for i 6= k; 0, otherwise.\nwhere \u03b2rl represents the cardinality of the subset P\u03b2rl all of whose elements have first co-ordinates Ail in set Pl and \u03b4sl represents the cardinality of that subset Q\u03b4sl , all of whose elements have first co-ordinates Akl in set Ql. (ii) Members of the column Cl of S i.e (A1l, A2l, . . . , Aml)\nT are of numeric type: If the type of the attribute is an integer we follow the procedure discussed in Case II item (i) . For fractional numbers we follow the procedure discussed in Case I item (ii) and we define the set Pl as the members of column Cl that belong to decision class Ain and Ql as the members of column Cl that belong to decision class Akn. We then compute the skewness measure sk(Pl) = 1 m \u2211m i=1(Ail\u2212Ail) 3\n( \u221a\n1 m \u2211m i=1(Ail\u2212Ail)2)3 where Ail denote\nthe mean of Ail for each l = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1 and sk(Ql) = 1 m \u2211m i=1(Akl\u2212Akl) 3\n( \u221a\n1 m \u2211m i=1(Akl\u2212Akl)2)3 where Akl denote\nthe mean of Akl for each l = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1. We then construct the sets Tl and Sl as follows: Tl = {a \u2208 Pl|a \u2264 Ail, for sk(Pl) < 0} or, Tl = {b \u2208 Pl|b > Ail, for sk(Pl) \u2265 0} and similarly Sl = {a \u2208 Pl|a \u2264 Akl, for sk(Pl) < 0} or, Sl = {b \u2208 Pl|b > Akl, for sk(Pl) \u2265 0}. We now define the index ICl(Ri, Rk) between the two records Ri, Rk as\nICl(Ri, Rk) =\n{ min{\u03b2l\u03bb , \u03b4l \u03bb }, for i 6= k;\n0, otherwise.\nIn the above definition \u03b2l and \u03b4l represents the cardinalities of the sets Tl and Sl respectively. The sum of the cardinalities of the sets Pl and Ql is represented by \u03bb\nThe proximity or distance scores between the clinical records in the data set S can be represented as D = {{0, d12, . . . , d1m}; {d21, 0, . . . , d2m}; . . . ; {dm1, dm2, . . . , 0}} where dik = \u221a\u2211n\u22121 l=1 I 2 Cl (Ri, Rk). For each of the missing value instances in a record Ri our imputation procedure first computes the score \u03b1(xk) =\n(xk\u2212median(x)) median|xi\u2212median(x)| where\n{x1, x2, . . . , xn} denote the distances of R from Rk. We then pick up only those records (nearest neighbors) which satisfy the condition \u03b1(xk) \u2264 0 where {di1, di2, . . . , dim} denote the distances of the current record Ri to all other records in the data set S. If the type of attribute is categorical or integer, then the data value that has the highest frequency (mode) of occurrence in the corresponding columns of the nearest records is imputed. For the data values of type real we first collect all non zero elements in the set D and denote this set by B. For each element in set B we compute the quantity \u03b2(j)= 1B(j) \u2200j = 1, . . . , \u03b3 where \u03b3 denote the cardinality of the set B. We compute the weight matrix as W (j) =\n\u03b2j\u2211\u03b3 i=1 \u03b2(i)\n\u2200j = 1, . . . , \u03b3. The value to be imputed may be taken as \u2211\u03b3 i=1 P (i) \u2217W (i).\nAlgorithm 1 The PRAA Methodology Input: (a) Data sets for the purpose of decision making S(m,n) where m and n are\nnumber of records and attributes respectively and the members of S may have MV in any of the attributes except in the decision attribute, which is the last attribute in the record.\n(b) The type of attribute C of the columns in the data set.

The following decision rules are extracted from the decision tree shown in Fig. 1:\n1) The risk of atherosclerosis increases by a factor of \u22122.098 if an individual is suffering from hyperlipidemia since 1.5 years 2) The presence of hypertension (< 3.5 years) would increase the risk of atherosclerosis by a factor of \u22121.348; 3) The risk is estimated as \u22122.098\u22121.348\u22122.849\u22120.966\u2212 0.43\u2212 0.249 = \u22127.94 if an individual is suffering from hyperlipidemia from anywhere between 1.5 years to 4 years (HY PLTRV \u2265 1.5 and < 4.0), with hypertension since 3.5 years and cholesterol levels less than 166. It is observed that the presence of hyperlipoproteinemia and Glucose in urine would increase the risk of atherosclerosis."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "A new methodology (PRAA) with built in features for imputation of missing values that can be applied on datasets wherein the attribute values are either normal and/or highly skewed having either categorical and/or numeric attributes and identification of risk factors using wrapper based feature selection is discussed. The PRAA methodology has outperformed over the state-of-the-art methodologies in determining the risk\nfactors associated with the onset of atherosclerosis disease. The PRAA methodology has generated a decision tree with an accuracy of 99.7% for dataset DS2. Based on the performance measures we conclude that the use of PSO search for feature subset selection wrapped around ADT embedded with new imputation strategy for fitness evaluation have improved the prediction accuracies."}, {"heading": "VI. DISCUSSION", "text": "In this section we present a discussion on the performance of PRAA methodology on benchmark datasets, its computational complexity, scalability and comparative studies with other methodologies."}, {"heading": "A. Performance Comparison of new imputation procedure on Benchmark Datasets", "text": "Since no specific studies on imputation of missing values in cardiovascular disease data sets are available in the literature we have utilized some bench mark data sets obtained from Keel and University of California Irvin (UCI) machine learning data repositories [48], [50] to test the performance of the new imputation algorithm. The Wilcoxon statistics in Table II is computed based on the accuracies obtained by the new imputation algorithm with the accuracies of those obtained by using embedded algorithms for handling missing values such as C4.5 decision tree. The results in Table II below clearly demonstrate that the imputation procedure presented in Section III-B has superior performance when compared to other imputation algorithms as the test statistics are well below or equal to the critical values with p < 0.05 in all cases."}, {"heading": "B. Comparison with other Related Methodologies on Atherosclerosis", "text": "In this section we compare the results obtained in [5], [24], [22] with the results of our new methodology on the risk group dataset DS2. As compared to [24] where in CFS with genetic search and C4.5 is employed, an SE of 39.4% and SP of 82.8% is observed. In [22] SVM was used to classify the patients with an SE of 95% and SP of 90%. In [5] both NB and MLP were used for classification with an accuracy of 80% and the could obtain an SE of 92% and 82%, an SP of 53% and 76% respectively. The new methodology when applied on the dataset DS2 resulted in an accuracy of 99.73%, an SE of 99.35% and an SP of 100% which is regarded as a good classification model since both SE and SP are higher than 80%.\nC. Computational Complexity and Scalability of PRAA Algorithm\nThe computational complexity is a measure of the performance of the algorithm which can be measured in terms of the number of CPU clock cycles elapsed in seconds for performing the methodology on a dataset. For each data set having n attributes and m records, we select only those subset of records m1 \u2264 m, in which missing values are present. The distances are computed for all attributes n excluding the decision attribute. So, the time complexity for computing the distance would be O(m1 \u2217 (n \u2212 1)). The time complexity for computing skewness is O(m1). The time complexity for selecting the nearest records is of order O(m1). For computing the frequency of occurrences for nominal attributes and weighted average for numeric attributes the time taken would be of the order O(m1). Therefore, for a given data set with k-fold cross validation having n attributes and m records, the time complexity of our new imputation algorithm would be k \u2217 (O(m1 \u2217 (n \u2212 1) \u2217m) + 3 \u2217 O(m1)) which is asymptotically linear. Our experiments were conducted on a personal computer having an Intel(R) core (TM) 2 Duo, CPU @2.93 GHZ processor with 4 GB RAM and the time taken by PRAA for varying database sizes is shown Fig. 2. We have employed a linear regression on our results and obtained the relation between the time taken (T) and the data size (D) as T = 14.909D\u2212 104.655, \u03b1 = 0.05, p = 0.0003, r2 = 0.994.\nThe presence of the linear trend between the time taken and the varying database sizes ensure the numerical scalability of the performance of PRAA methodology. A comparison with other related methodologies used in the study of atherosclerosis yields a conclusion that the new PRAA methodology presented in this paper has a superior performance over other methods studied in [5], [24], [22]. We hold the view that more intensive and introspective studies of this kind will pave way for effective risk prediction and diagnosis of atherosclerosis."}], "references": [{"title": "Molecular and cellular imaging of atherosclerosis: Emerging applications", "author": ["A J.

hardening of artery walls due to cholesterol known as atherosclerosis is responsible for large number of deaths world-wide. The disease progression is slow, asymptomatic and may lead to sudden cardiac arrest, stroke or myocardial infraction. Presently, imaging techniques are being employed to understand the molecular and metabolic activity of atherosclerotic plaques to estimate the risk. Though imaging methods are able to provide some information on plaque metabolism they lack the required resolution and sensitivity for detection. In this paper we consider the clinical observations and habits of individuals for predicting the risk factors of CHD. The identification of risk factors helps in stratifying patients for further intensive tests such as nuclear imaging or coronary angiography. We present a novel approach for predicting the risk factors of atherosclerosis with an in-built imputation algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO). We compare the performance of our methodology with other machine learning techniques on STULONG dataset which is based on longitudinal study of middle aged individuals lasting for twenty years. Our methodology powered by PSO search has identified physical inactivity as one of the risk factor for the onset of atherosclerosis in addition to other already known factors. The decision rules extracted by our methodology are able to predict the risk factors with an accuracy of 99.73% which is higher than the accuracies obtained by application of the state-of-theart machine learning techniques presently being employed in the identification of atherosclerosis risk studies.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
