There may be more than one lemma with the same basic-form and the same ID, but belonging to a different category: for example nouns that can also be used as adjectives or vice versa (\"abbagliante\"). Each lemma has one or more meanings which become its sense in a given context.\n1 D. Christen, Syntagma. A Linguistic Approach to Parsing. (2013), http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5960."}, {"heading": "1.3 Meanings", "text": "Meanings are related to Lemmas through the ID index. Each entry, identified by the MNG index, contains the information that belongs to one specific meaning of a word, given by its dictionary definition. Beside the definition, all kinds of meaning-related information are stored here. First of all, grammatical proprieties, like transitivity, reflexivity, auxiliary and control; but also morphological restrictions over mood, tense, person, genre, number that come with a specific meaning. The remaining fields are dedicated to data which are used in Word Sense Disambiguation tasks and during the selection of parsing results, where the Syntagma parser applies a close interaction between syntactic and semantic information2. These features inherit the use of a word, its register, its domain (\"biology\", \"economy\", \"medicine\"...); but also its synonyms and contraries (if mentioned in the source-dictionary) and semantic features (\"modal\", \"espistemic\", \"causative\", \"perceptive\"...). The content of a Meaning data addresses also locutions and idiomatic expressions in which the given word appears. Examples and quotations, coming from the source-dictionary and which illustrate the use of a given word-meaning in its context, are also stored here.\nThe following example shows the record Meaning 23293.01, which contains information about the first meaning of the verb \"forget\" (Ital.: \"dimenticare\"):\nMNG 23293.01; LEX \"dimenticare\"; PRON \"[di-men-ti-c\u00e0-re]\"; ID 23293; CAT 100; CATS \"v.tr.\"; AUX \"avere\"; TRN 2; RFL 0; CTRL F; POS ; LNG; REG ; ALIAS ; SYN (\"scordare\" \"obliare\"); CNTR ; IDIOM ; SEM ; REF ; RESTR ; VL \"(subj-v-arg)\"; PRF \"Perdere la memoria di una cosa\";\nThe record Meaning also contains a field with syntactic constraints or other kinds of restrictions, related to a specific word meaning. Constraints have the form of a kind of logic expression, resulting from a formalization, done automatically by the Dictionary Scanner, which thus translates additional information given in the source-dictionary. Constraints allow AND and OR operators and emebedding. For example, meaning 995.67 of the word \"acqua\" (\"water\") means in Italian \"amniotic fluid\" (\"liquido organico, liquido amniotico\". The information that, in this specific sense, the word \"acqua\" can appear only in the plural form (\"in partic., al pl.,\"), has been transposed by the Dictionary Scanner in the following constraint:\nRESTR \"{Context(TAG=NP) Target(TAG=N) Restriction(NUM=pl.)}\"\nThe Meaninig-record of a word provided with an argument structure is related to the Valency table through the index MNG."}, {"heading": "1.4 Valency", "text": "The Valency table describes the argument structure of a specific word meaning (Meaning record). For each argument, its syntactic function (FNCT), its projection (NP, VP, AdjP, AdvP, Clause), the required connectives, its optionality and different kinds of constraints that may occur are stored. Constraints may be over lexical (VLEX) or semantic (VSEM) features of arguments: for example a specific sense of \"abbaiare\" (\"bark\") shows that its subject has to be a \"dog\", while other meanings of the same verb, i.e. figuratively, also allow a \"person\" as a subject. Constraints may also specify the syntactic context and word position on the expression level. Varieties of the same function are also registered, for example when an object may have both the projection as an NP or as a dependent Clause (i.e. verb \"see\"). For example, MNG 23293.01 the verb \"dimenticare\" (\"forget\") belongs, in the dictionary, to a basic\n2 D. Christen, Syntagma.

The two C projections of the object function are the result of the formalization, done by the Dictionary Scanner, of the information that this function may be expressed also in the form of a clause with the given features (\"anche con l'arg. espresso da frase (introd. da di o da che)\".\nIf the source-dictionary mentions some additional or optional argument, the related expression found in the dictionary is formalized and added to the argument structure.\n2.
