CDL has formulas B\u03c8\u03d5 to express that the agent believes \u03d5 conditional on \u03c8. As we will see, CDL has a certain relationship with the \u201cAGM theory\u201d of belief revision due to due to Alchourro\u0301n, Ga\u0308rdenfors, and Makinson [1]. So we may also think of B\u03c8\u03d5 as say that the agent will believe \u03d5 after revising her belief state by successfully incorporating the information that \u03c8 is true. As with AGM theory, CDL assumes that conditionalization (i.e., revision) is always successful: the agent is to assume that the incoming information \u03c8 is completely trustworthy and therefore update her belief state by consistently incorporating this incoming information. If before the revision she holds beliefs that imply \u00ac\u03c8, then she must give up these beliefs so that she will come to believe \u03c8 after the revision takes place. The question then is how to do this in general.\nThe models of CDL are \u201cplausibility models.\u201d These are very close to Grove\u2019s \u201csystem of spheres\u201d for AGM theory [6]. As we will see, we can view the conditionalization/revision process either from the semantic perspective, as a definite operation on plausibility models, or from the syntactic perspective, as an axiomatic formulation analogous to the postulate-based approach of AGM.

' denotes the relation ' := (\u2265 \u2229 \u2264) of equi-plausibility. A pointed plausibility model is a pair (M,w) consisting of a plausibility model M and the point w, itself a world in M .

Therefore, if \u2264 is a well-order and S is a nonempty set of worlds, minS is the set of worlds that are the most plausble in S. While it may at first seem counterintuitive to the uninitiated, this convention of \u201clesser is more plausible\u201d is nevertheless standard in Belief Revision Theory.1\nWe think of the plausibility relation as describing the judgments of an unnamed agent: for each pair of worlds (x, y), she either judges one world to be more plausible than the other or the two to be of equal plausibility. Plausibility models for multiple agents have a number of plausibility relations, one for each agent. For present purposes, we restrict attention to the single-agent case, though we say more about the multi-agent situation later.\nDefinition 2.2 (Plausibility model terminology). Let M = (W,\u2264, V ) be a plausibility model.\n\u2022 To say M is finite means W is finite.\n\u2022 To say M is connected means that for each x \u2208W , we have cc(x) = W , where\ncc(x) := {y \u2208 x | x(\u2265 \u222a\u2264)+y}\nis the connected component of x and (\u2265\u222a\u2264)+ is the transitive closure of \u2265\u222a\u2264.2 A connected component is a subset S \u2286W for which there exists an x \u2208W such that cc(x) = S.\n\u2022 To say M is well-founded means \u2264 is well-founded: for each nonempty S \u2286W , the set\nminS := {x \u2208 S | \u2200y \u2208 S : y 6< x}\nof minimal elements of S is nonempty.\n\u2022 To say that a set S \u2286W of worlds is smooth in M means that for each world x \u2208 S, either x \u2208 min(S) or there exists y \u2208 min(S) such that y < x. Given a collection \u0393 \u2286 \u2118(W ) of sets of worlds, to say that M is smooth with respect to \u0393 means that every S \u2208 \u0393 is smooth in M . To say that M is smooth means that M is smooth with respect to \u2118(W ).\n\u2022 To say that M is total means that \u2264 is total on W : for each (x, y) \u2208W \u00d7W , we have x \u2264 y or y \u2264 x.\n\u2022 To say M is well-ordered (equivalently, that M is a well-order) means that \u2264 is well-ordered (i.e., it is total and well-founded).\n\u2022 To say that M is locally total means that \u2264 is total on each connected component : for each w \u2208 W and (x, y) \u2208 cc(w)\u00d7 cc(w), we have x \u2264 y or y \u2264 x.\n1This convention stems from the notion of \u201cGrove spheres\u201d [6]: given a well-order, worlds are arranged so that they sit on the surface of a number of concentric spheres. Worlds of strictly greater plausibility are assigned to spheres with strictly shorter radii, and equi-plausible worlds are assigned to the same sphere. In this way, the most plausible worlds sit on the surface of the innermost sphere, which has the minimum radius. Similarly, if we restrict attention to a nonempty set S of worlds, then we \u201crecenter\u201d the sphere around S. By this we mean that we create a new system of spheres consisting of just those worlds in S. After doing so, the most plausible worlds again sit on the surface of the innermost sphere, which again has the minimum radius.\n2The transitive closure of a binary relation R is the smallest extension R+ \u2287 R satisfying the property that xR+y and yR+z together imply xR+z.\n\u2022 To say M is locally well-ordered (equivalently, that M is a local well-order) means that \u2264 is locally well-ordered (i.e., it is well-founded and total on each connected component).\nTo say that a pointed plausibility model (M,w) satisfies one of the model-applicable adjectives above means that M itself satisfies the adjective in question.\nTheorem 2.3 (Relationships between terminology). Let M = (W,\u2264, V ) be a plausibility model and S \u2286W .\n1. If M is finite, then M is well-founded.\n2. If M is locally well-ordered, and S is a connected component, then\nminS = {x \u2208 S | \u2200y \u2208 S : x \u2264 y} .\n3. If M is well-ordered, then minS = {x \u2208 S | \u2200y \u2208 S : x \u2264 y}.\n4. M is well-founded iff M is smooth.\n5. M is well-ordered iff M is smooth and total.\n6. M is locally well-ordered iff M is smooth and locally total.\nProof. See the appendix.\nFrom now on, in this paper we will restrict ourselves to locally well-ordered plausibility models, unless otherwise specified."}, {"heading": "3 Conditional Doxastic Logic", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Language and semantics", "text": "Definition 3.1 (LCDL). Let P be a fixed set of propositional letters. The language of Conditional Doxastic Logic consists of the set of LCDL formulas \u03d5 formed by the following grammar:\n\u03d5 ::= \u22a5 | p | (\u03d5\u2192 \u03d5) | B\u03d5\u03d5 p \u2208P\nThe logical constant > (for truth) and the various familiar Boolean connectives are defined by the usual abbreviations. Other important abbreviations: B(\u03d5|\u03c8) denotes B\u03c8\u03d5, and B\u03d5 denotes B>\u03d5.\nThe formula B\u03c8\u03d5 is read, \u201cConditional on \u03c8, the agent believes \u03d5.\u201d Intuitively, this means that each of the most plausible \u03c8-worlds satisfies \u03d5. The forthcoming semantics will clarify this further. The basic idea is that a belief conditional on \u03c8 is a belief the agent would hold were she to minimally revise her beliefs so that she comes to believe \u03c8.\nDefinition 3.2 (LCDL-truth). Let M = (W,\u2264, V ) be a locally well-ordered plausibility model. We define a binary satisfaction relation |= between locally well-ordered pointed plausibility models (M,w) (written without surrounding parentheses) and LCDL-formulas and we define a function J\u2212K : LCDL \u2192 \u2118(W ) as follows.\n\u2022 J\u03d5KM := {v \u2208W |M,v |= \u03d5}. The subscript M may be suppressed.\n\u2022 M,w 6|= \u22a5.\n\u2022 M,w |= p iff p \u2208 V (w) for p \u2208P.\n\u2022 M,w |= \u03d5\u2192 \u03c8 iff M,w 6|= \u03d5 or M,w |= \u03c8.\n\u2022 M,w |= B\u03c8\u03d5 iff for all x \u2208 cc(w), we have\nx\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K = \u2205 or \u2203y \u2208 x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K : y\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K .\nB\u03c8\u03d5 holds at w iff for every world connected to w that has an equally or more plausible \u03c8-world y, the \u03c8-worlds that are equally or more plausible than y satisfy \u03d5.\nWe extend the above so that we may have sets S \u2286 LCDL of formulas on the right-hand side:\nM,w |= S means M,w |= \u03d5 for each \u03d5 \u2208 S .\nAlso, we will have occasion to use the following notion of local consequence: given a set S \u222a {\u03d5} \u2286 LCDL of formulas and writing P\u2217 to denote the class of pointed plausibility models,\nS |=` \u03d5 means \u2200(M,w) \u2208 P\u2217 : M,w |= S implies M,w |= \u03d5 .\nFinally, we write M |= \u03d5 to mean that M, v |= \u03d5 for each world v in M (\u201c\u03d5 is valid within M\u201d).\nRemark 3.3 (Knowledge). Baltag and Smets [4] read the abbreviation\nK\u03d5 := B\u00ac\u03d5\u22a5\nas \u201cthe agent knows \u03d5.\u201d This notion of \u201cknowledge\u201d is based on the rejection of a proposed belief revision. In particular, K\u03d5 = B\u00ac\u03d5\u22a5 says that the most plausible \u00ac\u03d5-worlds are \u22a5-worlds. The propositional constant \u22a5 for falsehood is true nowhere, so this amounts to us saying that the agent does not consider any \u00ac\u03d5-worlds possible. Hence all the worlds she considers possible are \u03d5-worlds. It is in this sense that we say she \u201cknows\u201d that \u03d5 is true: she will not revise her beliefs by \u00ac\u03d5 (on pain of contradiction). It is easy to see that the semantics ensures that K so-defined is an S5 modal operator: knowledge is closed under classical implication, what is known is true, it is known what is known, it is known what is not known, and all validities are known.\nIn well-founded plausibility models, belief in \u03d5 conditional on \u03c8 is equivalent to having \u03d5 true at the most plausible \u03c8-worlds that are within the connected component of the actual world. And if the models are well-ordered, then we can omit mention of the connected component.\nTheorem 3.4 (LCDL-truth in well-founded models). Let M = (W,\u2264, V ) be a plausibility model.\n(a) If M is well-founded: M,w |= B\u03c8\u03d5 \u21d4 minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) \u2286 J\u03d5K.\n(b) If M is well-ordered: M,w |= B\u03c8\u03d5 \u21d4 minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K.\nProof. See the appendix for the proof of (a). For (b), if M is well-ordered, then \u2264 is total and therefore cc(w) = W for each w \u2208W . Apply (a).\nThe intended models for CDL are the well-ordered (and hence well-founded) plausibility models.\nDefinition 3.5 (LCDL-validity). To say that a LCDL-formula \u03d5 is valid, written |= \u03d5, means that we have M |= \u03d5 for each well-ordered plausibility model M .\nAs per Theorem 3.4, restricting validity to the well-orders allows us to read B\u03c8\u03d5 as follows: \u201cthe most plausible \u03c8-worlds satisfy \u03d5.\u201d While the intended models for CDL are well-ordered, and validity is defined accordingly (as per Definition 3.5), the following theorem shows that locally well-ordered plausibility models would suffice.\nTheorem 3.6 (LCDL-validity with respect to local well-orders). Let PL be the class of locally well-ordered plausibility models. For each \u03d5 \u2208 LCDL, we have:\n|= \u03d5 iff \u2200M \u2208 PL, M |= \u03d5 .\nProof. Right to left (\u201cif\u201d): obvious. Left to right (\u201conly if\u201d): assume |= \u03d5 and take M = (W,\u2264, V ) \u2208 PL and a world w \u2208W . Let M \u2032 be the sub-model of M = (W \u2032,\u2264\u2032, V \u2032) obtained by restricting to cc(w):\nW \u2032 = cc(w), \u2264\u2032=\u2264 \u2229(W \u2032 \u00d7W \u2032), V \u2032(v) = V (v) for v \u2208W \u2032.\nSince M \u2208 PL, it follows that M \u2032 is well-ordered and therefore, since |= \u03d5, we have M \u2032, w |= \u03d5. It follows by a straightforward induction on the construction of LCDL-formulas \u03b8 that M\n\u2032, w |= \u03b8 iff M,w |= \u03b8. Hence M,w |= \u03d5. Since w \u2208 W and M \u2208 PL were chosen arbitrarily, we conclude that M |= \u03d5 for each M \u2208 PL.\n3.2 Board\u2019s theory BRSIC and CDL0\nThe Hilbert theory of Conditional Doxastic Logic was first studied by Board [5] under the name BRSIC. Baltag and Smets [4] subsequently developed various alternative axiomatizations and extensions and introduced the name Conditional Doxastic Logic. The single-agent version of Board\u2019s theory BRSIC is equivalent to what we call CDL0.\nDefinition 3.7 (CDL0 theory). CDL0 is defined in Table 1.\nCDL0 is actually a simplification of BRSIC. In particular, BRSIC is a multi-agent theory for a nonempty set A of agents using a language similar to LCDL except that it has as primitives both conditional belief B\u03c8a \u03d5 for each agent a \u2208 A and unconditional belief Ba\u03d5 for each agent a \u2208 A. Since the BRSIC axiom Ba\u03d5 \u2194 B>a \u03d5 (\u201cTriv\u201d) requires that unconditional belief be equivalent to conditional belief based on a tautological conditional, we have decided upon a streamlined language that contains conditional belief only. This allowed us to define away Board\u2019s axiom Triv in the following way (in Definition 3.1): let Ba\u03d5 abbreviate B>a \u03d5. We have also renamed some of Board\u2019s axioms and rules: his Taut is now called (CL), his Dist is now called (K), his IE(a) is now called (IEa), his IE(b) is now called (IEb), his TPI is now called (PI), his\nNPI is now called (NI), his RE is now called (MN), and all of his other axiom names have been enclosed in parenthesis. Finally, what we call (WCon) is the contrapositive of what Board called WCon. Restricting to a single-agent setting and thereby dropping subscripted agent names, we obtain the theory CDL0.\nRemark 3.8 (Multi-agent CDL0). A multi-agent version of CDL0 is obtained by making trivial modifications to the language, axiomatization, and semantics of CDL0. In particular, for a nonempty set A of agents, the multi-agent language L ACDL is like the single-agent language LCDL except that each conditional belief operator B\u03c8 is replaced by a number of operators B\u03c8a , one for each agent a \u2208 A. The multi-agent theory CDLA0 is obtained by adding a metavariable agent subscript a to each of the belief operators in Table 1. The models of CDLA0 are multi-agent plausibility models: these are like single-agent plausibility models presented above (in Definition 2.1) except that the preorder \u2264 is replaced by a preorder \u2264a for each agent a \u2208 A. The definition of truth for L ACDL on these models is like that in Definition 3.2 except that the meaning of M,w |= B \u03c8 a \u03d5 is changed so as to refer to the preorder \u2264a. Validity is defined with respect to the class of multi-agent plausibility models satisfying the property that each \u2264a is locally well-ordered.\nSo, in essence, the multi-agent version consists of multiple single agent versions such that each agent\u2019s conditional beliefs are always restricted to the worlds connected (for that agent) to the given world w currently under consideration. It is clear that restricting to one agent a yields a framework that is equivalent to the version of CDL0 we have presented here.\nWe note that the multi-agent version allows us to describe what one agent conditionally believes about what another agent conditionally believes. This is feature of interest in a wide variety of applications. However, from the technical perspective, the difference between the single- and multi-agent frameworks does not amount to too much in the way of mathematical shenanigans. It therefore suffices to indicate, as we have here, how the multi-agent version is obtained from the single-agent version and then restrict our study to the single-agent version. Of course, one may consult Board [5] for the fully specified account of the multi-agent theory BRSIC.\n3.3 The theory CDL\nIt will be our task in this paper to develop a version of Conditional Doxastic Logic with justifications in the tradition of Justification Logic [2]. We will say more about this later, but for now it suffices to say that justifications in this tradition are meant to encode the individual reasoning steps that the agent uses to support her belief in one statement based on justifications she has for beliefs in other statements. In this way, justifications are supposed to present a stepwise explanation for how the agent derives complex beliefs from more basic ones. It is in this sense that justifications are \u201cproof-like.\u201d\nIn order to make this precise, we require an axiomatization of Conditional Doxastic Logic that is more perspicious than is CDL0 with regard to the ways in which conditional beliefs obtain. In particular, (IEa), (IEb), and (LE) are powerful principles that in fact encode a number of more basic principles and, as such, these powerful principles compress a number of reasoning steps into a small number of postulates. This is especially obvious with (LE): a belief conditional \u03c8 may be replaced by a provably equivalent conditional \u03c8\u2032 in one step, which does not reflect the complexity of the derivation that was used to prove the equivalence \u03c8 \u2194 \u03c8\u2032. From the point of view of the Justification Logic tradition, wherein justifications should explain in a stepwise fashion how one conditional belief follows from another, this is undesirable. Intuitively, if the agent believes \u03d5 conditional on \u03c8, then the reason she believes \u03d5 conditional on a provably equivalent \u03c8\u2032 depends crucially on the reasoning as to why \u03c8\u2032 is in fact equivalent to \u03c8. If \u03c01 and a more complex \u03c02 are proofs of this equivalence, then an agent who bases her belief on the more complex \u03c02 should have a correspondingly more complex justification witnessing her belief. We therefore require an alternative but equivalent axiomatization of the theory CDL0 that makes such stepwise reasoning operations more explicit. The exact criteria we seek for such a theory are not precisely defined but are based on the authors\u2019 experience in working in the Justification Logic tradition. We call the theory we have settled upon CDL, and later we\nwill explain how this theory gives rise to a theory of Conditional Doxastic Logic with justifications.\nDefinition 3.9 (CDL theory). CDL is defined in Table 2.\nThe scheme (CL) of Classical Logic and the rule (MP) of Modus Ponens tell us that CDL is an extension of Classical Propositional Logic. The rule (MN) of Modal Necessitation tells us that derivable formulas hold in all conditional belief states.\nScheme (K) is just Kripke\u2019s axiom for our conditional belief operator B\u03c8. The scheme (Succ) of Success says that every belief revision is always successful: if the agent revises her belief based on the information that \u03c8, then she will always arrive in a belief state in which \u03c8 is one of her beliefs.\nMaking use of the definition of knowledge K\u03d5 := B\u00ac\u03d5\u22a5 from Remark 3.3, we can look at the following special case of the scheme (KM) of Knowledge Monotonicity :\nB\u00ac\u03c8\u22a5 \u2192 B\u00ac\u03c8\u2227\u00ac\u03d5\u22a5 .\nSince \u00ac\u00ac\u03c8 is equivalent to \u03c8 and \u00ac(\u00ac\u03c8 \u2227\u00ac\u03d5) is equivalent to \u03c8 \u2228\u03d5, we may interpret the above instance of (KM) as telling us that knowledge is closed under disjunction: if \u03c8 is known, then so is \u03c8 \u2228 \u03d5. But another interpretation perhaps better explains the word \u201cMonotonicity\u201d in the name of this scheme. Returning now to the official formulation\nB\u03c8\u22a5 \u2192 B\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u22a5\nof (KM), this scheme tells us that if we can conclude that a belief state conditional on \u03c8 is contradictory, then conjunctively adding any further information \u03d5 yields a belief state conditional on \u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5 that is still contradictory. Accordingly, the belief state is unchanged by the conjunctive addition of any further conditional information, and so the belief state is trivially \u201cmonotonic\u201d in the conjunctive addition of conditional information.\nThe scheme (RM) of Rational Monotonicity permits a more subtle kind of conjunctive addition. This scheme,\n\u00acB\u03c8\u00ac\u03d5\u2192 (B\u03c8\u03c7\u2192 B\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7) ,\nsays that if \u03d5 is consistent with the belief state conditional on \u03c8, then we may conjunctively add \u03d5 to our conditional without losing any beliefs from the original belief state. This is a non-trivial monotonicity: incorporating the information \u03d5 by forming the conditional \u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5 yields a belief state that includes all the beliefs from the belief state conditional on \u03c8, but it may also include more.\nThe scheme (Inc) of Inclusion says that a belief state conditional on \u03c8 includes every \u03c7 implied by \u03d5 whenever the belief state conditional on the conjunction \u03c8 \u2227\u03d5 includes \u03c7. The scheme (Comm) of Commutativity says that the belief state conditional on a conjunction is invariant to the ordering of the conjuncts. The schemes (PI) of Positive Introspection and (NI) or Negative Introspection tell us that conditional beliefs are identical in all belief states. The scheme (WCon) of Weak Consistency tells us that belief revision is consistent with the actual state of affairs: if a revision by \u03c8 yields a contradictory belief state, then \u03c8 cannot be true.\nRemark 3.10 (Classical reasoning (CR), modal reasoning (MR)). When discussing derivation in CDL, we will often suppress elementary reasoning steps familiar from the study of normal modal logics. Toward this end, \u201cclassical reasoning,\u201d which may be denoted by (CR), refers to a derivation with one or more steps that makes use solely of (CL) and (MP). \u201cModal reasoning,\u201d which may be denoted by (MR), refers to a derivation with one or more steps that makes use solely of (CL), (K), (MP), and (MN).\nTheorem 3.11 (CDL-theorems).

See the appendix."}, {"heading": "4 AGM Belief Revision", "text": "The most influential theory of belief change is due to Alchourro\u0301n, Ga\u0308rdenfors, and Makinson [1]. Their theory, commonly called to the \u201cAGM theory,\u201d takes the view that an agent\u2019s belief state (or \u201cdatabase\u201d) is represented by a deductively closed set of sentences T called a \u201cbelief set.\u201d The agent is understood to believe exactly those sentences in her belief set T , and various operators on T are used to describe various kinds of changes in her belief state. Of particular interest is the revision operator, now often denoted using the symbol \u201c \u2217 \u201d. This operator takes new information in the form of a sentence \u03c8 and produces another belief set T \u2217 \u03c8 that contains \u03c8. Intuitively, the revision operation assumes that the incoming information \u03c8 is completely trustworthy and so it should be incorporated into the database. However, simply adding \u03c8 and taking the deductive closure, forming the expansion\nT + \u03c8 := Cn(T \u222a {\u03c8}) (1)\nusing an assumed consequence-closure operator Cn(\u2212) underlying the setting, might lead to an inconsistent belief set. By this it is meant that T + \u03c8 might be logically inconsistent according to the logic governing Cn(\u2212). Therefore, we cannot simply equate revision with expansion but must do something more clever so that the revised belief set T \u2217 \u03c8 not only contains \u03c8 but is also consistent whenever \u03c8 is consistent.\nInstead of providing an exact procedure for computing revision, the AGM approach is \u201cpostulate based\u201d: a number of axiomatic postulates are provided, some intuitive justification is given as to why a revision operator should satisfy each of the postulates, and any operation on belief sets that satisfies all of the postulates is said to be an AGM revision operator. So in principle, there are many revision operators, and each is to be studied from an axiomatic point of view using the AGM revision postulates.\nFollowing the exposition of AGM theory from [7] (but with some minor modifications), we begin with a set P of propositional letters (usually countable). The set LCPL of formulas (the \u201cpropositional formulas\u201d or \u201cformulas of Classical Propositional Logic\u201d) consists of those expressions that can be built up from the propositional letters and the Boolean constants \u22a5 (falsehood) and > (truth) using the usual Boolean connectives. A deductive theory is assumed, and this theory is specified in terms of a Tarskian consequence operator: for any set S of formulas, Cn(S) is the set of logical consequences of S. It is assumed that Cn(\u2212) satisfies the following conditions:\n\u2022 Inclusion: S \u2286 Cn(S),\n\u2022 Monotony (also sometimes called \u201cMonotonicity\u201d): S \u2286 S\u2032 implies Cn(S) \u2286 Cn(S\u2032),\n\u2022 Iteration: Cn(S) = Cn(Cn(S)), and\n\u2022 Supraclassicality: Cn(S) contains each classical tautology in LCPL.\nIt is usually assumed that Cn(\u2212) also satisfies the following conditions:\n\u2022 Deductive Consistency: \u22a5 /\u2208 Cn(\u2205); and\n\u2022 Compactness: \u03d5 \u2208 Cn(S) iff there exists a finite S\u2032 \u2286 S such that \u03d5 \u2208 Cn(S\u2032).\nThe alternative notation S ` \u03d5 is used to express \u03d5 \u2208 Cn(S). A belief base is a set of formulas in the language, and a belief set is a deductively closed belief base (i.e., Cn(S) = S). Note that the phrase \u201cbelief state\u201d (a.k.a., \u201cdatabase\u201d) is an intuitive notion meant to describe the agent\u2019s situation with regard to her beliefs. This intuitive notion is formalized either by a belief base (not necessarily deductively closed) or a belief set (necessarily deductively closed). A belief base T \u2032 gives rise to a belief set T by applying the consequence operator: T := Cn(T \u2032).\nA revision operator is meant to take an existing belief set T and some incoming information \u03c8 and produce a new belief set T \u2217 \u03c8 that incorporates the incoming information \u03c8 (i.e., \u03c8 \u2208 T \u2217 \u03c8), is consistent\nwhenever the incoming information \u03c8 is consistent (i.e., T \u2217 \u03c8 0 \u22a5 if \u03c8 is consistent), and is obtained from T by way of a \u201cminimal change.\u201d The latter is an intuitive (and non-formalized) guiding principle that is used to persuade the reader that certain proposed postulates are desirable. From a formal perspective, it can be safely ignored.\nThe AGM revision postulates are reproduced in Table 3. Postulates 1\u20136 are called the Ga\u0308rdenfors postulates (or, more elaborately, the \u201cbasic Ga\u0308rdenfors postulates for revision\u201d). Postulates 7\u20138 are called the supplementary postulates.\nGrove [6] proposed a possible worlds modeling of the AGM postulates. Modulo certain details we gloss over, his proposal essentially amounts to this: represent the agent\u2019s belief set using the minimal worlds of a well-ordered plausibility model and define revision in terms of belief conditionalization.\nTheorem 4.1 (AGM revision and Grove spheres; adapted from [6]). Let Cn(\u2212) be the consequence function CPL(\u2212) of Classical Propositional Logic over the language LCPL. For each well-ordered plausibility model M , each belief set T \u2286 LCPL, and each propositional formula \u03c8 \u2208 LCPL, define\nM\u2193 := {\u03d5 \u2208 LCPL | min(W ) \u2286 J\u03d5KM} , T \u2217M \u03c8 := {\u03d5 \u2208 LCPL | minJ\u03c8KM \u2286 J\u03d5KM} , BCPL := {L \u2286 LCPL | CPL(L) = L} .\nNote that BCPL is the collection of all propositional belief sets. For a propositional formula or set of propositional formulas X \u2208 LCPL \u222a \u2118(LCPL), to say X is consistent means \u22a5 /\u2208 CPL(X) (or equivalently, that CPL(X) 6= LCPL), and to say X is inconsistent means it is not consistent. To say that a plausibility model M is a system of spheres means that M is well-ordered and the function\nM\u2193 \u2217M (\u2212) : LCPL \u2192 BCPL\nmapping propositional formulas \u03c8 \u2208 LCPL to belief sets M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 \u2208 BCPL satisfies the AGM revision postulates. To say that M is a Grove system for a belief set T \u2208 BCPL means that M is a system of spheres and M\u2193 = T .\n(a) Each consistent belief set T \u2208 BCPL has a Grove system.\n(b) Suppose for a function \u2217 : BCPL \u00d7LCPL \u2192 BCPL and each (T, \u03c8) \u2208 BCPL \u00d7LCPL we have:\n(i) if T is inconsistent, then T \u2217 \u03c8 = M\u2193\u2217 \u2217M\u2217 \u03c8 for some fixed system of spheres M\u2217; and (ii) if T is consistent, then T \u2217 \u03c8 = T \u2217MT \u03c8 for some fixed Grove system MT for T .\nIt follows that \u2217 is an AGM revision operator.\nProof. See the appendix.\nThis suggests that we may view CDL as a version of AGM belief revision in which the revision process itself can be described in the language [5, 4]. In particular, for propositional formulas \u03d5 and \u03c8, the formula B\u03d5, which is our abbreviation for B>\u03d5, says that the agent believes \u03d5 before the revision takes place; and the formula B\u03c8\u03d5 says that the agent believes \u03d5 after revision by \u03c8. So by restricting to propositional \u03d5 and \u03c8, we can use conditional belief formulas B\u03c8\u03d5 to describe a version of the AGM revision process directly in the language of LCDL. This leads us to the following overview of what the axiomatic theory CDL (Table 2) has to say about the CDL-based version of AGM revision.\n\u2022 (CL) and (MP) indicate that we use a classical meta-theory.\n\u2022 The principles we have grouped together under the name \u201cmodal reasoning\u201d\u2014(CL), (MP), (K), and (MN)\u2014together correspond to AGM Closure and AGM Extensionality. In addition, it follows by modal reasoning that our underlying \u201cconsequence operator\u201d satisfies Inclusion, Monotony, Iteration, and Supraclassicality.\n\u2022 (Succ) corresponds to AGM Success.\n\u2022 Under the assumption of (Succ), scheme (KM) corresponds to consequence of AGM Consistency: inconsistency of revision by \u03c8 implies inconsistency of \u03c8 and therefore of \u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5, and so inconsistency of revision by \u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5 follows via (Succ).\n\u2022 Under the assumption of (Succ), scheme (RM) corresponds to AGM Subexpansion. And if \u03d5 = >, then (Succ) and (RM) together correspond to AGM Vacuity.\n\u2022 (Inc) corresponds to AGM Subexpansion. And, if \u03d5 = >, then (Inc) corresponds to AGM Inclusion.\n\u2022 (Comm) corresponds to a special case of AGM Extensionality (i.e., commutativity of conjunction).\n\u2022 (PI) and (NI) do not corresponds to principles in the AGM setting (belief sets are subset of LCPL).\n\u2022 (WCon) corresponds to AGM Consistency."}, {"heading": "5 Justified Conditional Doxastic Logic", "text": "Though CDL may be viewed as a version of AGM revision in which Boolean combinations of revisions are expressible in the language, one key aspect that is missing: the reasons as to why revisions result in a state in which certain formulas are believed. This is a deficit present also in AGM revision: while a revision by \u03c8 may lead to a belief set that includes \u03d5, it is not immediately clear why it is that \u03d5 ought to obtain. What is missing is some language-describable reason that explains how it is \u03d5 came about as a result of the revision. It shall be our task in this section to study how we might \u201cfill in\u201d these reasons in a theory based on CDL. Our approach follows the general paradigm of Justification Logic [2], where modal operators are replaced by syntactically structured objects called terms. Terms are meant to suggest \u201creasons\u201d in the sense that the\nsyntactic structure of a term accords with certain derivational principles in the underlying logic. Our goal is to adapt this methodology to CDL. In particular, for a term t, we introduce new formulas\nt :\u03c8\u03d5\nwith the intended meaning that, whenever the agent revises her belief state by incorporating the formula \u03c8, then t will be a reason justifying her belief of \u03d5 in the resulting belief state. Intuitively, the formula t :\u03c8\u03d5 tells us two things. First, it tells us that the agent believes \u03d5 conditional on \u03c8, which was the information conveyed in CDL by the formula B\u03c8\u03d5. Second, something new: the formula t :\u03c8\u03d5 tells us that the reason encoded by t supports \u03d5. Taken together, t :\u03c8\u03d5 tells us that the agent has a reason-based belief of \u03d5 after revising by \u03c8.\nTerms will be built up using a simple grammar. At the base of this grammar are the \u201ccertificates,\u201d which are terms of the form c\u03d5 for some formula \u03d5. Intuitively, whenever we have one or more reasons in support of \u03d5, the certificate c\u03d5 picks out the \u201cbest\u201d one. So whenever \u03d5 has any support at all, we are always guaranteed that c\u03d5 names a particular reason in support of \u03d5. As such, the theory we eventually define will derive the principle\nt :\u03c8\u03d5\u2192 c\u03d5 :\u03c8\u03d5 ,\nwhich says that the certificate c\u03d5 supports \u03d5 after a revision by \u03c8 whenever there is some reason t that support \u03d5 after the same revision. In essence, certificates allow us to \u201cforget\u201d the details of a complex argument in support of some assertion, remembering only that we at some point found such an argument.\nThough a certificate c\u03d5 must support the formula \u03d5 it certifies, as per the above-mentioned derivable principle, we do not prevent c\u03d5 from supporting other formulas as well. For example, it is consistent with the theory we will develop for us to have c\u03d5 :\n\u03c8\u03c7 for some \u03c7 6= \u03d5. As such, though we require certificates to provide \u201cbest evidence\u201d for the formulas they certify, we do not require that this be the only evidence that they provide.\nOther terms are formed from certificates using one of two operators. The first is the Application operator \u201c \u00b7 \u201d from Justification Logic. This operator is used to indicate that terms are to be combined using a single step of the rule of Modus Ponens. In particular, the logic we will develop will derive the following principle:\nt :\u03c8(\u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52)\u2192 (s :\u03c8\u03d51 \u2192 (t \u00b7 s) :\u03c8\u03d52) .\nThis says that if t supports an implication after the revision by \u03c8 and s supports the antecedent after the same revision, then the combination t \u00b7 s supports the consequence after that revision. This is the reasonexplicit version of the principle (K) of CDL. The difference is that the present version tells us something about how we obtained the consequent: the form of t \u00b7 s, with t to the left and s to the right, indicates that t supports an implication and s supports the antecedent, and hence we were able to derive the consequent via one step of Modus Ponens in virtue of the fact that we use a single instance of the Application operator \u201c \u00b7 \u201d to combine t with s to form t \u00b7 s.\nThe second term-combining operator we introduce is the Sum operator \u201c+\u201d from Justification Logic. This operator allows us to combine to reasons in a way that preserves support. In particular, the logic we develop will derive the following principle:\n(t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2228 s :\u03c8\u03d5)\u2192 (t+ s) :\u03c8\u03d5 .\nThis says that t+ s supports \u03d5 whenever at least one of t or s does so. As such, the sum t+ s combines the supported statements of t and of s without performing logical inference.\nFormulas of the language will be built up from the language of Classical Propositional Logic (based on propositional letters, the constant \u22a5 for falsehood, and material implication) by adding formulas of the form t :\u03c8\u03d5, where t is a term and \u03d5 and \u03c8 are other formulas. Intuitively, t :\u03c8\u03d5 says that t supports the agent\u2019s belief of \u03d5 after she revises her beliefs by incorporating \u03c8.\nThe theory we shall define is called Justified Conditional Doxastic Logic or JCDL. In addition to the derivable principles mentioned above, JCDL has a number of additional principles that make explicit the revision-based principles of CDL. In particular, we will see that every CDL-principle gives rise to a corresponding JCDL-principle, and the other way around as well. We explain this in more detail after the main definitions are in place."}, {"heading": "5.1 Language and axiomatics", "text": "Definition 5.1 (LJCDL). Let P be a fixed set of propositional letters. The language of Justified Conditional Doxastic Logic consists of the set LJCDL of formulas \u03d5 and set TJCDL of terms t formed by the following grammar:\n\u03d5 ::= p | \u22a5 | (\u03d5\u2192 \u03d5) | t :\u03d5\u03d5 p \u2208P\nt ::= c\u03d5 | (t \u00b7 t) | (t+ t)\nStandard abbreviations for Boolean constants and connectives are used, and parentheses are dropped when doing so will cause no confusion. We adopt the following key abbreviation:\nB\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 denotes c\u03d5 : \u03c8\u03d5 .\nWe may write c(\u03d5) as an abbreviation for c\u03d5 when convenient. Also, we let t :\u03d5 abbreviate t : \u2205\u03d5, and we let B\u0307\u03d5 abbreviate B\u0307\u2205\u03d5.\nRoughly speaking, it will be useful to think of B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 as the JCDL-analog of the CDL-expression B\u03c8\u03d5. We will see that every CDL-principle gives rise to a JCDL-principle obtained by replacing modal operators \u201cB\u03c8 \u201d by reason-based operators \u201c t :\u03c8 \u201d. Accordingly, if B\u03c8\u03d5 is CDL-derivable, then a corresponding t :\u03c8 \u2032 \u03d5\u2032 will be derivable, where \u03c8\u2032 corresponds to \u03c8 and \u03d5\u2032 corresponds to \u03d5). So using the certificate c\u03d5\u2032 for \u03d5 \u2032, it will follow that B\u0307\u03c8 \u2032 \u03d5\u2032 is derivable as well. It is in this sense that B\u0307\u03c8 \u2032 \u03d5\u2032 may be thought of as the JCDL-analog of the CDL-principle B\u03c8\u03d5.\nDefinition 5.2 (JCDL theory). The theory JCDL is defined in Table 4.\n(CL) and (MP) tell us that JCDL is an extension of Classical Propositional Logic. (eK) is our reason-explicit analog of the CDL-scheme (K); it tells us that reason support is closed under the rule of Modus Ponens using the Application operator \u201c \u00b7 \u201d. (eSucc) is our reason-explicit analog of CDL (Succ); it tells us that certificates are used to certify the success of belief revisions. (eKM) is our reasonexplicit version of (KM); it tells us that a reason supporting a contradiction conditional on some \u03c8 continues to do so no matter what additional information we conjunctively add to the conditional.\n(eRM) is our reason-explicit version of (RM). The antecedent \u00acB\u0307\u03c8\u00ac\u03d5 is just lnotc\u00ac\u03d5 :\u03c8\u00ac\u03d5. Since the certificate c\u00ac\u03d5 will always stand in for some argument relevant to \u00ac\u03d5, the antecedent \u00acB\u0307\u03c8\u00ac\u03d5 tells us that \u03d5 is consistent with the belief state obtained after revision by \u03c8. And (eRM) tells us that if this is so and t is a reason to believe \u03c7 after revision by \u03c8, then it follows that t is still a reason to believe \u03c7 even after we revise by the conjunction \u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5. Notice that the reason t for \u03c7 does not change; it is only the revision formula itself that changes.\n(eInc) is our reason-explicit version of (Inc); it tells us that that a belief of \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 is certified after revising by \u03c8 so long as there is a reason t for believing \u03c8 after revising by \u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5. (eComm) tells us that reasons are invariant to the order of conjuncts in revisions; this is the reason-explicit analog of (Comm). (ePI) and (eNI) are the reason-explicit versions of (PI) and (NI), respectively; these tell us that all support and negated support statements are certified. (eWCon) is the reason-explicit analog of (WCon); it tells us that if t is a reason supporting a belief in \u22a5 after revision by \u03c8, then \u00ac\u03c8 must have been true.\n(eA) is particular to JCDL. This scheme tells us that if t supports a belief in \u03d5 conditional on \u03c8 and \u03d5 is also certified conditional on some other \u03c7, then t must itself support \u03d5 conditional on \u03c7 as well. This\ntells us that if a reason supports a belief of \u03d5 after some revision, it does so no matter the particulars of the revision. Said another way, reason support depends only on the statement supported (and not on the revision).\n(eMN) says that every derivable formula is \u201ccertified\u201d (i.e., supported by its certificate). This corresponds to the CDL-principle (MN). But while all derivable principles are certified, intuitively such certification omits a great deal of information; in particular, it is not clear from which axioms a given principle follows and how it is that it follows by way of the rules of the theory. Toward this end, it will be useful to consider a restriction of (eMN) in which we apply this rule only to axioms, possibly multiple times in a row. An axiom to which we apply (eMN) zero or more times in a row will be called a \u201cpossibly necessitated axiom.\u201d We will see that if we remove (eMN) from the theory, then all JCDL-theorems can be derived from the possibly necessitated axioms using (MP) as the only rule. The trick to this will be to eliminate from JCDL-derivations uses of (eMN) that are \u201ctroublesome necessitations\u201d: these are the derivable consequences of (eMN) that are not themselves possibly necessitated axioms. If we can show that all such \u201ctroublesome necessitations\u201d can be eliminated, then the result follows. This will be our task now.\nThe terms that can be formed from certificates of possibly necessitated axioms using the Application operator \u201c \u00b7 \u201d will be called the \u201clogical terms.\u201d These terms play a special role: every JCDL-theorem \u03d5 gives rise to a logical term t that supports \u03d5 (i.e., t :\u03c8\u03d5 is derivable for each \u03c8).\nDefinition 5.3 (Necessitations, logical terms). A necessitation is a LJCDL-formula of the form\nB\u0307\u03c8nB\u0307\u03c8n\u22121B\u0307\u03c8n\u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 B\u0307\u03c81\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 zero or more of these \u03d5 (2)\nfor some integer n \u2265 0. A possibly necessitated axiom is a LJCDL-formula of the form (2) for which n \u2265 0 and \u03d5 is a JCDL-axiom. The set T LJCDL of logical terms is the smallest set that contains certificates c\u03d5 for each possibly necessitated axiom \u03d5 and is closed under the term-forming operation t, s 7\u2192 t \u00b7 s.\nDefinition 5.4 (Troublesome necessitations, notation \u03c0 `nJCDL \u03d5). A JCDL-derivation is finite nonempty sequence of LJCDL-formulas, each of which is either a JCDL-axiom or follows by a JCDL-rule from formulas occurring earlier in the sequence. A line of a JCDL-derivation \u03c0 is an element of the sequence \u03c0. A troublesome necessitation is a line \u03d5 of a JCDL-derivation that neither is a possibly necessitated axiom nor follows from earlier lines by (MP). Clearly, a troublesome necessitation must follow by applying (eMN) to an earlier line that is not itself a possibly necessitated axiom. For n \u2208 N, we write \u03c0 `nJCDL \u03d5 to mean that \u03c0 is a JCDL-derivation that contains at most n troublesome necessitations and whose last line is \u03d5. For n \u2208 N, we write `nJCDL \u03d5 to mean that there exists a JCDL-derivation \u03c0 such that \u03c0 `nJCDL \u03d5. Obviously, `JCDL \u03d5 implies `nJCDL \u03d5 for some n \u2208 N.\nThe following lemma shows that every JCDL-theorem can be derived from the possibly necessitated axioms using (MP) as the only rule of inference.\nLemma 5.5 (Elimination of troublesome necessitations). For each \u03d5 \u2208 LJCDL, we have:\n\u03c0 `nJCDL \u03d5 \u21d2 \u2203\u03c0\u2217 \u2287 \u03c0, \u03c0\u2217 `0JCDL \u03d5 . (3)\nProof. See the appendix.\n\u201cTheorem Internalization\u201d is a property of Justification Logics whereby every theorem \u03d5 of the logic is witnessed by supporting term. Since certificates trivially support JCDL-theorems by (eMN), the usual formulation of Theorem Internalization is trivialized in our setting. However, we can prove a stronger variant: every JCDL-theorem \u03d5 is witnessed by a logical supporting term. This stronger version tells us that all JCDL-theorems are witnessed by terms that refer only to possibly necessitated axioms and combinations of these using rule (MP).\nTheorem 5.6 (JCDL Theorem Internalization). For each \u03c8 \u2208 LJCDL, we have:\n`JCDL \u03d5 \u21d2 \u2203t \u2208 T LJCDL, `JCDL t :\u03c8\u03d5 .\nProof. See the appendix.\n5.2 Relationship to CDL\nIn our motivation of JCDL, we have described the formula t :\u03c8\u03d5 as an analog of a corresponding LCDLformula B\u03c8\u03d5. Up to this point, the idea was mere intuition. We now make this intuition precise by defining two mappings. The first, called \u201cforgetful projection,\u201d maps LJCDL-formulas to LCDL-formulas by replacing each \u201c t :\u03c8 \u201d prefix by the prefix \u201cB\u03c8 \u201d. The second, called \u201ctrivial realization,\u201d maps LCDL-formulas to LJCDL-formulas by replacing each prefix \u201cB\n\u03c8 \u201d by the prefix \u201c B\u0307\u03c8 \u201d. We will see that these operations preserve derivability of schemes.\nDefinition 5.7 (The forgetful projection). The forgetful projection is the function\n(\u2212)\u25e6 : LJCDL \u2192 LCDL\ndefined by:\nq\u25e6 := q for q \u2208P \u222a {\u22a5} (\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8)\u25e6 := \u03d5\u25e6 \u2192 \u03c8\u25e6\n(t :\u03c8\u03d5)\u25e6 := B\u03c8 \u25e6 \u03d5\u25e6\nThe forgetful projection of \u03c8 \u2208 LJCDL is the \u03c8\u25e6 \u2208 LCDL. Extend the function (\u2212)\u25e6 to sets \u0393 \u2286 LJCDL by \u0393\u25e6 := {\u03d5\u25e6 | \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393}. We further extend the function (\u2212)\u25e6 to schemes. In particular, let S be a fixed set of schematic variables (i.e., \u201cmetavariables\u201d or placeholders for formulas) that includes all schematic variables used in this paper and that has cardinality min{|P|, \u03c9}. For each of our languages L \u2208 {LCDL,LJCDL}, let L (S) be the set of formula schemes that can be formed using the formula formation grammar of L but with schematic variables in S used in place of propositional letters in P. Define TJCDL(S) similarly. Using \u03a6 and \u03a8 as metavariables ranging over members of LJCDL(S) and T as a metavariable ranging over members of TJCDL(S), let"}, {"heading": "X\u25e6 := X for X \u2208 S \u222a {\u22a5}", "text": "(\u03a6\u2192 \u03a8)\u25e6 := \u03a6\u25e6 \u2192 \u03a8\u25e6\n(T :\u03a8\u03a6)\u25e6 := B\u03a8 \u25e6 \u03a6\u25e6\nExtend the function (\u2212)\u25e6 to sets \u0393 \u2286 LJCDL(S) by \u0393\u25e6 := {\u03a6\u25e6 | \u03a6 \u2208 \u0393}.\nDefinition 5.8 (Realizations and the trivial realization). A realization of a formula \u03d5 \u2208 LCDL is a formula \u03c8 \u2208 LJCDL for which \u03c8\u25e6 = \u03d5 and `JCDL \u03c8.

As in Definition 5.7 and using the notation from that definition, we extend the function (\u2212)t to schemes:\nXt := X for X \u2208 S \u222a {\u22a5}\n(\u03a6\u2192 \u03a8)t := \u03a6t \u2192 \u03a8t\n(B\u03a8\u03a6)t := B\u0307\u03a8 t \u03a6t\nFinally, we apply (\u2212)t to sets \u0393 \u2286 LCDL(S) by defining \u0393t := {\u03a6t | \u03a6 \u2208 \u0393}. For some object Z in the domain of (\u2212)t we say that Zt is the trivial realization of Z.\nThe trivial realization of a formula or scheme of CDL is obtained by replacing each \u201cB \u201d with \u201cB\u0307 \u201d. Note that while the word \u201crealization\u201d in the phrase \u201ctrivial realization\u201d suggests that the trivial realization of a formula or scheme is indeed a realization (i.e., we obtain something derivable in JCDL), this does not come automatically (i.e., by definition) because the trivial realization is a mere syntactic translation and so it must be proved that this translation satisfies the requisite property before the conclusion can be drawn. However, the following theorem guarantees that the trivial realization is indeed a realization. The theorem also tells us that the forgetful projection maps JCDL-theorems to CDL-theorems.\nTheorem 5.9 (Projection and realization for schemes). We use the notation from Definitions 5.7 and 5.8. For each \u0393 \u222a {\u03d5} \u2286 LJCDL(S) and each \u2206 \u222a {\u03c8} \u2286 LCDL(S), we have:\n1. \u0393 `JCDL \u03d5 implies \u0393\u25e6 `CDL \u03d5\u25e6, and\n2. \u2206 `CDL \u03c8 implies \u2206t `JCDL \u03c8t.\nProof. See the appendix.\nTheorem 5.9 tells us that JCDL really is an explicit analog of CDL: every JCDL-derivable statement gives rise to a CDL-derivable statement (by forgetful projection), and every CDL-derivable statement gives rise to a JCDL-derivable statement (by trivial realization). This link makes precise our intuition that the LCDL-formula B \u03c8\u03d5 should correspond to the LJCDL-formula B\u0307 \u03c8\u03d5.\nThough Theorem 5.9 is stated with respect to schemes, we have the analogous result for formulas as well.\nTheorem 5.10 (Projection and realization for formulas). We use the notation from Definitions 5.7 and 5.8. For each \u0393 \u222a {\u03d5} \u2286 LJCDL and each \u2206 \u222a {\u03c8} \u2286 LCDL, we have:\n1. \u0393 `JCDL \u03d5 implies \u0393\u25e6 `CDL \u03d5\u25e6, and\n2. \u2206 `CDL \u03c8 implies \u2206t `JCDL \u03c8t.\nProof. Replace each distinct propositional letter with a distinct schematic variable, apply Theorem 5.9, and take the instances of the resulting derivable schemes obtained by substituting the original propositional variables back into their corresponding positions.\nUsing Theorem 5.9, the CDL-principles from Theorem 3.11 translate into JCDL-principles.\nTheorem 5.11 (JCDL-theorems).

Here we adapt the traditional Fitting semantics for use in our language LJCDL.\nDefinition 5.12 (Fitting models). A Fitting model is a structure M = (W,\u2264, V, A) for which (W,\u2264, V ) is a locally well-ordered plausibility model and A is an admissibility function: a function\nA : (TJCDL \u00d7LJCDL)\u2192 \u2118(W )\nthat maps each term-formula pair (t, \u03d5) to a set A(t, \u03d5) \u2286W of worlds subject to the following restrictions:\n\u2022 Certification: A(c\u03d5, \u03d5) = W , which says formulas are certified by their certificates;\n\u2022 Application: A(t, \u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52) \u2229A(s, \u03d51) \u2286 A(t \u00b7 s, \u03d52), which says the Application operator encodes instances of (MP);\n\u2022 Sum: A(t, \u03d5) \u222aA(s, \u03d5) \u2286 A(t+ s, \u03d5), which says the Sum operator encodes support aggregation without logical inference; and\n\u2022 Admissibility Indefeasibility: if x \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and y \u2208 cc(x), then y \u2208 A(t, \u03d5), which says admissibility is constant within each connected component. Using the notion of \u201cknowledge\u201d from Remark 3.3, this tells us that the agent knows her admissibility function.\nThe notion of pointed Fitting model is similar to the corresponding definition found in Definition 2.2; we also apply the terminology from that definition to Fitting models in the obvious way.\nIf A is an admissibility function, then w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) says that, from the perspective of world w, term t has the proper \u201csyntactic shape\u201d to be a reason in support of \u03d5. This does not, however, guarantee that t does indeed support \u03d5. For this we shall require something more.\nDefinition 5.13 (LJCDL-truth). LetM = (W,\u2264, V, A) be a Fitting model. We extend the binary satisfaction relation |= from Definition 3.2 to one between pointed Fitting models (M,w) (written without surrounding parentheses) and LJCDL-formulas and we extend the function J\u2212K from Definition 3.2 to include a function J\u2212K : LJCDL \u2192 \u2118(W ) as follows.\n\u2022 J\u03d5KM := {v \u2208W |M,v |= \u03d5}. The subscript M may be suppressed.\n\u2022 M,w 6|= \u22a5.\n\u2022 M,w |= p iff p \u2208 V (w) for p \u2208P.\n\u2022 M,w |= \u03d5\u2192 \u03c8 iff M,w 6|= \u03d5 or M,w |= \u03c8.\n\u2022 M,w |= t :\u03c8\u03d5 iff w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and\n\u2200x \u2208 cc(w) : x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K = \u2205 or \u2203y \u2208 x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K : y\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K . (4)\nSo to have t :\u03c8\u03d5 true at a world w, we must have two things. First, from the perspective of w, term t must have the correct \u201csyntactic shape\u201d for an argument in support of \u03d5; that is, we must have w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5). Second, we must satisfy the condition (4), which is the same condition we had for truth of a LCDL-formula B\u03c8\u03d5. So, taken together, to have t :\u03c8\u03d5 true at world w means that t has the \u201cshape\u201d of an argument for \u03d5 and the agent believes \u03d5 after revising her beliefs by \u03c8. The following theorem states this precisely.\nTheorem 5.14 (JCDL-truth in terms of belief formulas). Let M = (W,\u2264, V, A) be a Fitting model.\nM,w |= t :\u03c8\u03d5 iff w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and M,w |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 .\nProof. Left to right (\u201conly if\u201d): assume M,w |= t :\u03c8\u03d5. By Definition 5.13, we have w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and (4). Since we have w \u2208 A(c\u03d5, \u03d5) by the Certification property of admissibility functions and we have B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 = c\u03d5 :\u03c8\u03d5 by definition, it follows from by (4) and w \u2208 A(c\u03d5, \u03d5) by Definition 5.13 that M,w |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5.\nRight to left (\u201cif\u201d): assume w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and M,w |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5. Applying Definition 5.13 and the definition B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 = c\u03d5 :\n\u03c8\u03d5, it follows that (4). So since we have w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and (4), it follows by Definition 5.13 that M,w |= t :\u03c8\u03d5.\nIn well-founded Fitting models, belief in \u03d5 conditional on \u03c8 is equivalent to having \u03d5 true at the most plausible \u03c8-worlds that are within the connected component of the actual world.\nTheorem 5.15 (JCDL-truth in well-founded models). Let M = (W,\u2264, V, A) be a Fitting model.\n(a) If M is well-founded: M,w |= t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u21d4 w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) \u2286 J\u03d5K.\n(b) If M is well-ordered: M,w |= t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u21d4 w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K.\nProof. (a), left to right (\u201conly if\u201d): assume M,w |= t :\u03c8\u03d5. By Definition 5.13, we have w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and (4). Use the argument in the proof of Theorem 3.4 to conclude that minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) \u2286 J\u03d5K. (a), right to left (\u201cif\u201d): assume w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) \u2286 J\u03d5K. Use the argument in the proof of Theorem 3.4 to conclude that (4). Applying Definition 5.13, it follows that M,w |= t :\u03c8\u03d5.\n(b): M is well-ordered, then cc(w) = W and M is well-founded. Apply (a).\nAnd so in well-founded Fitting models, we can see that formulas B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 really do play the semantic analog of LCDL-belief formulas.\nTheorem 5.16 (JCDL-truth in well-founded models in terms of belief formulas). Let M be a Fitting model.\n(a) If M is well-founded: M,w |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 \u21d4 minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) \u2286 J\u03d5K.\n(b) If M is well-ordered: M,w |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 \u21d4 minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K.\nProof. By the Certification (Definition 5.12) and Theorems 5.14 and 5.15.\nSimilar to LCDL, the intended semantic objects for LJCDL are the well-ordered models of the appropriate type (in this case Fitting models, as opposed to simple plausibility models).\nDefinition 5.17 (LJCDL-validity). To say that a LJCDL-formula \u03d5 is valid, written |= \u03d5, means that M |= \u03d5 for each well-ordered Fitting model M . Though we use the same symbol \u201c|=\u201d for LJCDL-validity as we did for LCDL-validity, it will be clear from context which notion is meant.\nAnd as for CDL, locally well-ordered plausibility models would suffice.\nTheorem 5.18 (LJCDL-validity with respect to local well-orders). Let FL be the class of locally well-ordered Fitting models. For each \u03d5 \u2208 LJCDL, we have:\n|= \u03d5 iff \u2200M \u2208 FL, M |= \u03d5 .\nProof. As in the proof of Theorem 3.6.\nSoundness and completeness of JCDL with respect to its intended semantics (i.e., well-ordered Fitting models) makes use of many components of the proof of Theorem 3.13, itself essentially due to [5].\nTheorem 5.19 (JCDL soundness and completeness).

Since JCDL is a reason-explicit analog of CDL (as per Theorem 5.9), we are led to the following suggestion: JCDL is a version of AGM revision in which Boolean combinations of reasonexplicit revisions are expressible in the language. In essence, a formula \u03d5 that is part of the belief state after revision by \u03c8 may be witnessed by a specific reason t whose syntactic structure tracks the genesis of \u03d5 stepwise from basic principles. This suggests we think of JCDL as a theory of revisable justified belief. It would be interesting to see if there is some explicit version of the AGM revision principles that matches up with JCDL in the way that standard AGM matches up with CDL. However, we leave this issue for future work."}, {"heading": "A Technical results", "text": "A.1 Results for plausibility models\nProof of Theorem 2.3. Item 1 is obvious. Item 2 is a well-known result from order theory, but we reprove it anyway for completeness purposes. So assume M is locally well-ordered and \u2205 6= S = cc(w) \u2286 W for some w \u2208W . Define\nS\u2032 := {x \u2208 S | \u2200y \u2208 S : x \u2264 y} .\nWe wish to prove that minS = S\u2032. Proceeding, take x \u2208 minS. If y \u2208 S as well, then it follows from x \u2208 minS by the definition of minS that y 6< x, from which we obtain x \u2264 y because S is a connected component and \u2264 is total on each connected component. Since y \u2208 S was chosen arbitrarily, it follows that x \u2208 S\u2032. Hence minS \u2286 S\u2032. To show the inclusion holds in the other direction, take x \u2208 S\u2032. If y \u2208 S, then it follows from x \u2208 S\u2032 by the definition of S\u2032 that x \u2264 y, from which we obtain y 6< x by the definition of 6<. Since y \u2208 S was chosen arbitrarily, it follows that x \u2208 minS. Hence S\u2032 \u2286 minS.\nFor Item 3, it follows from the fact that \u2264 is well-ordered that W is a connected component. Further, since \u2264 is well-ordered, it is also locally well-ordered. The result therefore follows by Item 2.\nFor Item 4, let us first assume that M is well-founded. We wish to prove that each S \u2208 \u2118(W ) is smooth in M . So take S \u2208 \u2118(W ). Since \u2205 is smooth in M , let us assume further that S 6= \u2205. Now take x \u2208 S. Since x \u2208 x\u2193 \u2229 S by the reflexivity of \u2264, it follows that x\u2193 \u2229 S 6= \u2205. Therefore, since M is well-founded, it follows that min(x\u2193 \u2229 S) 6= \u2205. That is, there exists y \u2208 min(x\u2193 \u2229 S). But then y \u2264 x and x 6< y, from which it follows that y ' x or y < x. And if y ' x, then it follows from y \u2208 min(x\u2193 \u2229 S) by the transitivity of \u2264 that x \u2208 min(x\u2193 \u2229 S). So either we have x \u2208 min(x\u2193 \u2229 S) or we have y \u2208 min(x\u2193 \u2229 S) and y < x. Further,\nfor each m \u2208 min(x\u2193 \u2229 S) and z \u2208 S \u2212 (x\u2193 \u2229 S), we have by the transitivity of \u2264 that z 6< m. And for each m \u2208 min(x\u2193 \u2229 S) and z \u2208 (x\u2193 \u2229 S), we have by the definition of min(x\u2193 \u2229 S) that z 6< m. But then m \u2208 min(x\u2193 \u2229 S) implies m \u2208 minS. Taken together, we have shown that for each x \u2208 S, either x \u2208 minS or there exists y \u2208 minS such that y < x. It follows that S is smooth in M . Since we have shown that every S \u2208 \u2118(W ) is smooth in M , it follows that M is smooth.\nFor the converse of Item 4, we assume that M is smooth. We wish to prove that M is well-founded. So take a nonempty S \u2286 W . Since S is nonempty, we have x \u2208 S. But M is smooth and so S is smooth in M , and so it follows that x \u2208 minS or there exists y \u2208 minS such that y < x. In either case, we have minS 6= \u2205. So M is well-founded.\nItems 5 and 6 follow from Item 4 by Definition 2.2.\nA.2 Results for CDL\nProof of Theorem 3.4(a). Assume M is well-founded and M,w |= B\u03c8\u03d5. The latter means\n\u2200x \u2208 cc(w) : x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K = \u2205 or \u2203y \u2208 x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K : y\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K . (5)\nIf minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) = \u2205, then minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) \u2286 J\u03d5K. So let us assume further that minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) 6= \u2205. Take z \u2208 minJ\u03c8K\u2229 cc(w). Since we then have z \u2208 z\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K by the reflexivity of \u2264 and the definition of minJ\u03c8K, it follows by (5) that \u2203y \u2208 z\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K : y\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K . Now z \u2208 cc(w) and y \u2208 z\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K, so it follows that y \u2208 cc(w) and therefore that y \u2208 J\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w). From this we obtain by z \u2208 minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) that y 6< z. But y \u2208 z\u2193, and therefore we have y \u2264 z and z \u2264 y. As a result, z \u2208 y\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K. Since z \u2208 minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) was chosen arbitrarily, we have proved that minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) \u2286 J\u03d5K.\nConversely, assume M is well-founded and minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w) \u2286 J\u03d5K. To show that we have M,w |= B\u03c8\u03d5, we must show that (5) obtains. For this it suffices for us to take x \u2208 cc(w) satisfying x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K 6= \u2205 and prove that \u2203y \u2208 x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K : y\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K . (6) Proceeding, since x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K 6= \u2205 and M is well-founded, it follows that there exists y \u2208 min(x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K). Since minJ\u03c8K\u2229 cc(w) \u2286 J\u03d5K, if we can show that for every z \u2208 y\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K we have z \u2208 minJ\u03c8K\u2229 cc(w), then it would follow that y\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K and therefore that (6), completing the argument. So take z \u2208 y\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K. It follows by z \u2208 y\u2193, y \u2208 x\u2193, and x \u2208 cc(w) that z \u2208 cc(w). So to show that z \u2208 minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(w), all that remains is to prove that z \u2208 minJ\u03c8K, and for this it suffices to prove that u \u2208 z\u2193\u2229 J\u03c8K implies u 6< z. So take u \u2208 z\u2193\u2229 J\u03c8K. Since u \u2208 z\u2193, z \u2208 y\u2193, and y \u2208 x\u2193, we have\nu \u2264 z \u2264 y \u2264 x .\nBy the transitivity of \u2264, it follows that u \u2264 y and u \u2264 x. Hence u \u2208 x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K. Since y \u2208 min(x\u2193 \u2229 J\u03c8K), it follows that u 6< y. But from u 6< y and u \u2264 y, it follows by the definition of 6< that y \u2264 u. And from z \u2264 y \u2264 u, it follows by the transitivity of \u2264 that z \u2264 u. Applying the definition of 6<, we obtain u 6< z.\nProof of Theorem 3.11. We reason in CDL. For (Cut), assume B\u03c8\u03d5 and B\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7. It follows from B\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7 by (Inc) that B\u03c8(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c7). But from B\u03c8(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c7) and B\u03c8\u03d5 we obtain by (MR) that B\u03c8\u03c7.\nFor (CM), we reason by cases under the assumption B\u03c8\u03d5. First: if \u00acB\u03c8\u00ac\u03d5, then we obtain B\u03c8\u03c7 \u2192 B\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7 by (RM) and (CR). Second: if B\u03c8\u00ac\u03d5, then it follows by our assumption B\u03c8\u03d5 and (MR) that B\u03c8\u22a5; applying (KM) and (CR) yields B\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u22a5, from which we obtain B\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7 by (MR).\n(Taut) obtains by (CR) since B\u03d5 = B>\u03d5. (And) obtains by (MR). For (Or), we assume B\u03c81\u03d5 and B\u03c82\u03d5. Take i \u2208 {1, 2}. By (Succ) and (MR) we obtain B\u03c8i(\u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82). From B\u03c8i(\u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82) and our assumption B\u03c8i\u03d5, we obtain by (CM) and (Comm) that B(\u03c81\u2228\u03c82)\u2227\u03c8i\u03d5. From\nthis it follows by (Inc) that B\u03c81\u2228\u03c82(\u03c8i \u2192 \u03d5). Since we have this for each i \u2208 {1, 2}, it follows by (MR) that B\u03c81\u2228\u03c82((\u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82)\u2192 \u03d5). Since B\u03c81\u2228\u03c82(\u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82) by (Succ), we obtain the result B\u03c81\u2228\u03c82\u03d5 by (MR).\nFor (PR), we have the following:\n1.

It is straightforward to verify that this operation yields a derivation of (NR).\nFor (LE), assume \u03c8 \u2194 \u03c8\u2032. We have B\u03c8\u03c8 by (Succ). Applying (MR) to our assumption, we obtain B\u03c8(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8\u2032). Hence B\u03c8\u03c8\u2032 by (MR). By similar reasoning, we obtain B\u03c8\u2032\u03c8. Now by (CM), B\u03c8\u03c8\u2032, (Comm), and (CR), we obtain B\u03c8\u03c7\u2192 B\u03c8\u2032\u2227\u03c8\u03c7. By B\u03c8\u2032\u03c8, (Cut), and (CR), we obtain B\u03c8\u2032\u2227\u03c8\u03c7\u2192 B\u03c8\u2032\u03c7. But then it follows by (CR) that B\u03c8\u03c7 \u2192 B\u03c8\u2032\u03c7. A similar argument shows that B\u03c8\u2032\u03c7 \u2192 B\u03c8\u03c7. By (CR), we conclude that B\u03c8\u03c7\u2194 B\u03c8\u2032\u03c7.\n(RW) follows by (MR). For (SC), from \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 we obtain B\u03c8(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) by (MN); however, we have B\u03c8\u03c8 by (Succ), and so it follows by (MR) that B\u03c8\u03d5.\nProof of Theorem 3.12. Left to right: it suffices to show that CDL derives (IEa), (IEb), and (LE).\n\u2022 (IEa): `CDL B\u03c8\u03d5\u2192 (B\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7\u2194 B\u03c8\u03c7).

Let\nLCDLa := L {a} CDL and CDLa := CDL {a} 0 .\nWe write \u03c7a for the LCDLa-formula obtained from the LCDL0-formula \u03c7 by recursively replacing each occurrence of a modal operator B\u03b8 in \u03c7 by B\u03b8a. Obviously, (\u03c7 a)\u2032 = \u03c7 and (\u03b8\u2032)a = \u03b8.\nIt was shown by Board [5] that we have `CDLa \u03c7 iff |= {a} CDLa\n\u03c7. By Remark 3.8, this is equivalent to the statement that\n\u2200\u03c7 \u2208 LCDLa : `CDLa \u03c7 iff |= \u03c7\u2032 . (9)\nBy induction on derivation length, it is easy to see that the operation \u03c7 7\u2192 \u03c7a maps CDL0-theorems to CDLa-theorems and the operation \u03c7 7\u2192 \u03c7\u2032 maps CDLa-theorems to CDL0-theorems. So `CDL0 \u03d5 iff `CDL0 \u03d5a. Applying (9) and the fact that (\u03d5a)\u2032 = \u03d5, we obtain `CDL0 \u03d5 iff |= \u03d5. Applying Theorem 3.12, we obtain `CDL \u03d5 iff |= \u03d5.\nProof of Theorem 3.13. The argument can be obtained by combining the ideas from the various proofs in [5]. However, this requires restricting to the single-agent case and combining multiple arguments, so it is not so transparent how the argument should go. In the interest of making the argument clear and so that we have some constructions available for us later when we turn to the JCDL case, we provide a full proof here. However, the argument is truly due to [5].\nFor soundness, we proceed by induction on the length of derivation. In the induction base, we must show that each axiom scheme is wf-valid. (CL) is straightforward, so we proceed with the remaining schemes. Let M be an arbitrary well-founded plausibility model. We make tacit use of Theorem 3.4.\n\u2022 (K) is valid: |= B\u03c8(\u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52)\u2192 (B\u03c8\u03d51 \u2192 B\u03c8\u03d52). Assume (M,w) satisfies B\u03c8(\u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52) and B\u03c8\u03d51. Then minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52K and minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d51K. Hence minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d52K. So (M,w) satisfies B\u03c8\u03d52.\n\u2022 (Succ) is valid: |= B\u03c8\u03c8. We have minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03c8K by the definition of minJ\u03c8K.

Suppose (M,w) satisfies \u00acB\u03c8\u00ac\u03d5 and B\u03c8\u03c7. It follows that minJ\u03c8K * J\u00ac\u03d5K and minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03c7K. Hence minJ\u03c8K \u2229 J\u03d5K 6= \u2205. We prove that minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K \u2286 minJ\u03c8K \u2229 J\u03d5K. Proceeding, take x \u2208 minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K.

Since x \u2208 minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K and \u2264 is total, we have x \u2264 y. But x \u2208 J\u03c8K and y \u2208 minJ\u03c8K, and therefore it follows from x \u2264 y that x \u2208 minJ\u03c8K as well. Since x \u2208 J\u03d5K, we have x \u2208 minJ\u03c8K\u2229J\u03d5K. Conclusion: minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K \u2286 minJ\u03c8K\u2229J\u03d5K.

Then minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K \u2286 J\u03c7K. We prove that minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5\u2192 \u03c7K. Proceeding, take x \u2208 minJ\u03c8K. If x /\u2208 J\u03d5K, then x \u2208 J\u03d5\u2192 \u03c7K. So let us assume further that x \u2208 J\u03d5K and therefore that x \u2208 J\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K. Now take any y \u2208 J\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K. Since y \u2208 J\u03c8K, if we had y < x, then it would follow that x /\u2208 minJ\u03c8K, contradicting our choice of x. Hence y \u2208 J\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K implies y 6< x, from which it follows by x \u2208 J\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K that x \u2208 minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K. But we have minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K \u2286 J\u03c7K and hence x \u2208 J\u03c7K, from which we obtain x \u2208 J\u03d5\u2192 \u03c7K. Conclusion: (M,w) satisfies B\u03c8(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c7).\n\u2022 (Comm) is valid: |= B\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7\u2192 B\u03d5\u2227\u03c8\u03c7. Suppose (M,w) satisfies B\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7. Then minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K \u2286 J\u03c7K. Since J\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K = J\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8K, it follows that minJ\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8K \u2286 J\u03c7K. But then (M,w) satisfies B\u03d5\u2227\u03c8\u03c7.\n\u2022 (PI) is valid: |= B\u03c8\u03c7\u2192 B\u03d5B\u03c8\u03c7. Suppose (M,w) satisfies B\u03c8\u03c7. Hence minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03c7K, which implies that (M,v) satisfies B\u03c8\u03c7 for any given v \u2208 cc(w) = W . That is, JB\u03c8\u03c7K = W . Therefore, minJ\u03d5K \u2286 JB\u03c8\u03c7K. Conclusion: (M,w) satisfies B\u03d5B\u03c8\u03c7.\n\u2022 (NI) is valid: |= \u00acB\u03c8\u03c7\u2192 B\u03d5\u00acB\u03c8\u03c7. Suppose (M,w) satisfies \u00acB\u03c8\u03c7. Then minJ\u03c8K * J\u03c7K. It follows that M,v |= \u00acB\u03c8\u03c7 for each v \u2208 cc(w) = W . Therefore, J\u00acB\u03c8\u03c7K = W , from which it follows that minJ\u03d5K \u2286 J\u00acB\u03c8\u03c7K. Conclusion: (M,w) satisfies B\u03d5\u00acB\u03c8\u03c7.\n\u2022 (WCon) is valid: |= B\u03c8\u22a5 \u2192 \u00ac\u03c8. Suppose (M,w) satisfies B\u03c8\u22a5. It follows that minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u22a5K = \u2205. Since \u2264 is well-founded, it follows that J\u03c8K = \u2205. But this implies J\u00ac\u03c8K = W . So (M,w) satisfies \u00ac\u03c8.\nThis completes the induction base. For the induction step, we must show that validity is preserved under the rules of (MP) and (MN). The argument for (MP) is standard, so let us focus on (MN). We assume |= \u03d5 for the CDL-derivable \u03d5 (this is the \u201cinduction hypothesis\u201d), and we prove that |= B\u03c8\u03d5. Proceeding, since we have |= \u03d5 by the induction hypothesis, it follows that J\u03d5K = W and hence that minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K. But then (M,w) satisfies B\u03c8\u03d5. Soundness has been proved.\nSince CDL is sound with respect to the class of well-ordered plausibility models we note that CDL is consistent (i.e., 0CDL \u22a5). In particular, take any pointed plausibility model (M,w) containing only the\nsingle world w. Since there is only one world, M is well-ordered. Further, by soundness, we have that `CDL \u03d5 to M,w |= \u03d5. Therefore, since M,w 6|= \u22a5 by Definition 3.2, it follows that 0CDL \u22a5. That is, CDL is consistent. We make use of this fact tacitly in what follows.\nFor completeness, we write ` without any subscript in the remainder of this proof as an abbreviation for `CDL. Take \u03b8 such that 0 \u00ac\u03b8. We shall prove that \u03b8 is satisfiable at a locally well-ordered pointed plausibility model and then apply Theorem 3.6 to draw the desired conclusion. Our construction is based on the completeness constructions given in [5]. Proceeding, provability will always be taken with respect to CDL, the language is assumed to be LCDL, and we make tacit use of Theorem 3.11. To say that a set of formulas is consistent means that for no finite subset does the conjunction provably imply \u22a5. For sets S and S\u2032 of formulas, to say that S is maximal consistent in (or \u201cmaxcons in\u201d) S\u2032 means that S \u2286 S\u2032, S is consistent, and extending S by adding any formula in S\u2032 not already present would yield a set that is inconsistent (i.e., not consistent). Given a formula \u03d5, we write sub(\u03d5) to denote the set of sub-formulas of \u03d5, including \u03d5 itself. We extend this definition to sets of formulas: for a set S of formulas, sub(S) := \u22c3 \u03d5\u2208S sub(\u03d5). Given a set S of formulas, we write \u2295S to denote the Boolean closure of S (with respect to the language): this is the smallest extension of S that contains all Boolean constants that are primitive to the language (i.e., \u22a5) and is closed under all Boolean operations that are primitive to the language (i.e., implication). Since our language is Boolean complete (i.e., every Boolean constant and every Boolean connective is definable in terms of the Boolean constants and Boolean connectives primitive to the language), it follows that the Boolean closure \u2295S of S is the smallest extension of S that contains all definable Boolean constants (i.e., \u22a5 and >) and is closed under all definable Boolean connectives (e.g., implication, conjunction, disjunction, and negation). For a set S of formulas, we define:\n\u00b1S := S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2208 S} , B0S := S ,\nBi+1S := \u00b1{B\u03c8\u03d5 | \u03c8 \u2208 S and \u03d5 \u2208 BiS} , B\u03c9S := \u22c3 0<i<\u03c9 BiS ,\nC0 := \u00b1 sub({\u03b8,\u22a5,>}) , C1 := \u2295C0 , B := B\u03c9C1 ,\nC := C1 \u222aB .\nNotice that 0 is excluded in the definition of B\u03c9S. Further, C0 is finite. Since 0 \u00ac\u03b8, we may extend {\u00ac\u03b8} to a set w\u03b8 that is maxcons in C. We then define:\nW := {x \u2286 C | x is maxcons in C} , x\u0304 := \u2227 (x \u2229 C0) for x \u2208W , x\u03c8 := {\u03d5 | B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x} for x \u2208W and \u03c8 \u2208 C1 , \u2264 := {(x, y) \u2208W \u00d7W | \u2203\u03c8 \u2208 (x \u2229 y \u2229 C1), y\u03c8 \u2286 x} ,\nV (x) := P \u2229 x for x \u2208W , M := (W,\u2264, V ) .\nNotice that for x \u2208W , we have x\u0304 \u2208 C1, from which it follows by the maximal consistency of x in C \u2287 C1 that x\u0304 \u2208 x. Further, it follows by the definition x\u0304 = \u2227 (x \u2229C0) and the fact that x is maximal consistent in C = C1 \u222aB that for each \u03c8 \u2208 C1 = \u2295C0, we have ` x\u0304\u2192 \u03c8 or ` x\u0304\u2192 \u00ac\u03c8. Finally, if x \u2264 y and x 6= y, then it follows by the maximal consistency of x and of y in C that x\u0304 /\u2208 y and y\u0304 /\u2208 x and therefore that ` x\u0304\u2192 \u00acy\u0304 and ` y\u0304 \u2192 \u00acx\u0304. We make tacit use of the facts mentioned in this paragraph in what follows.\nWe prove that W is finite. First a definition due to [8]: to say a set S of formulas is logically finite means that S has a finite basis, which is a finite S\u2032 \u2286 S satisfying the property that for every \u03c7 \u2208 S, there exists\n\u03c7\u2032 \u2208 S\u2032 such that ` \u03c7 \u2194 \u03c7\u2032. It can be shown by a normal form argument that if S is logically finite, then there can be only finitely many sets that are maximal consistent in S. So to prove that W is finite, it suffices to prove that C is logically finite. Proceeding, since C1 was obtained as the Boolean closure of the finite set C0, it follows by a normal form argument that C1 has a finite basis C \u2032 1. So for B\n\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 B1C1, since we have that \u03c8 \u2208 C1 and \u03d5 \u2208 B0C1 = C1, there exists \u03c8\u2032 \u2208 C \u20321 and \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 C \u20321 such that\n` \u03c8 \u2194 \u03c8\u2032 and ` \u03d5\u2194 \u03d5\u2032 .\nApplying (LE) and modal reasoning, it follows that\n` B\u03c8\u03d5\u2194 B\u03c8\u2032\u03d5\u2032 .\nSince B\u03c8 \u2032 \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 B1C \u20321 and \u00acB\u03c8 \u2032 \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 B1C \u20321, it follows by classical reasoning that B1C \u20321 is a finite basis for B1C1. Therefore, there exists a finite basis B \u2032 1 for \u2295B1C \u20321. We prove by induction on positive i < \u03c9 that the set B\u20321 is also a finite basis for BiC1. The induction base case i = 1 (for B1C1) has already been handled. So let us proceed with the induction step: we assume B\u20321 is a finite basis for BjC1 for each non-negative integer j that does not exceed some fixed i \u2265 1 (this is the \u201cinduction hypothesis\u201d), and we prove that B\u20321 is a finite basis for Bi+1C1. Proceeding, take \u03c7 \u2208 Bi+1C1. Since i \u2265 1, we have i+ 1 \u2265 2 and therefore \u03c7 has one of the forms B\u03c8B\u03b4\u03d5, B\u03c8\u00acB\u03b4\u03d5, \u00acB\u03c8B\u03b4\u03d5, or B\u03c8\u00acB\u03b4\u03d5 for some \u03d5 \u2208 Bi\u22121C1. We have by (PR), (NR), and classical reasoning that the following \u201creductive equivalences\u201d obtain:\n` B\u03c8B\u03b4\u03d5\u2194 (B\u03c8\u22a5 \u2228B\u03b4\u03d5) , ` \u00acB\u03c8B\u03b4\u03d5\u2194 (\u00acB\u03c8\u22a5 \u2227 \u00acB\u03b4\u03d5) , ` B\u03c8\u00acB\u03b4\u03d5\u2194 (B\u03c8\u22a5 \u2228 \u00acB\u03b4\u03d5) , ` \u00acB\u03c8\u00acB\u03b4\u03d5\u2194 (\u00acB\u03c8\u22a5 \u2227B\u03b4\u03d5) .\nB\u03c8\u22a5 and \u00acB\u03c8\u22a5 are members of B1C1, and B\u03b4\u03d5 and \u00acB\u03b4\u03d5 are members of BiC1. Since i + 1 > 1 and i + 1 > i, we may apply the induction hypothesis: there exist members (B\u03c8\u22a5)\u2032, (\u00acB\u03c8\u22a5)\u2032, (B\u03b4\u03d5)\u2032, and (\u00acB\u03b4\u03d5)\u2032 of B\u20321 such that the following \u201cinductive equivalences\u201d obtain:\n` B\u03c8\u22a5 \u2194 (B\u03c8\u22a5)\u2032 , ` \u00acB\u03c8\u22a5 \u2194 (\u00acB\u03c8\u22a5)\u2032 , ` B\u03b4\u03d5\u2194 (B\u03b4\u03d5)\u2032 , ` \u00acB\u03b4\u03d5\u2194 (\u00acB\u03b4\u03d5)\u2032 .\nLet us call the four formulas appearing on the right sides of the inductive equivalences the \u201creduced formulas.\u201d Each reduced formula is a member of the finite basis B\u20321 for \u2295B1C1, and therefore each reduced formula is also a member of \u2295B1C1. Since \u2295B1C1 is closed under all definable Boolean operations and B\u20321 is a finite basis for \u2295B1C1, it follows that any Boolean combination of the reduced formulas is also a member of \u2295B1C1 and therefore that any such Boolean combination is provably equivalent to a formula in B\u20321. But then it follows by the inductive equivalences and classical reasoning that the right side of each reductive equivalence is provably equivalent to a Boolean combination of reduced formulas, and the latter combination is itself provably equivalent to a formula in B\u20321. It follows that our original formula \u03c7 \u2208 Bi+1C must be provably equivalent to a formula in B\u20321 as well. Therefore, B \u2032 1 is indeed a finite basis for Bi+1C1. This completes the induction step. We conclude that B\u20321 is a finite basis for BiC1 for each i \u2265 1. As a result, it follows that B\u20321 is a finite basis for B = B\u03c9C1 = \u22c3 0<i<\u03c9 BiC1. But then C \u2032 1 \u222a B\u20321 is a finite basis for C = C1 \u222a B. Conclusion: W is finite. Suppose we are given x \u2208 W and \u03d5 \u2208 x. If ` \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2208 C, then it follows by the maximal consistency of x in C that \u03c8 \u2208 C. It is tedious to repeatedly verify membership assertions in C and state that the reason the result follows is by the fact that x is maximal consistent in C. Therefore, we adopt the convention that we shall generally only write that ` \u03d5\u2192 \u03c8 and \u03d5 \u2208 x together imply \u03c8 \u2208 x. In so doing, we\ntacitly indicate (and the reader should verify) that \u03c8 \u2208 C, x is maximal consistent in C, and so the result follows by the maximal consistency of x in C. The reader will always know when such tacit use takes place (and requires verification), since this use occurs every time it is stated that a membership assertion \u03c8 \u2208 x obtains as a logical consequence of some collection of assumptions that does not include the assumption \u03c8 \u2208 x itself. Finally, for convenience in the remainder of the proof, we shall say that a set is \u201cmaximal consistent\u201d to mean that it is maximal consistent in C.\nAgreement Lemma: for each {x, y} \u2286 W , if \u03c8 \u2208 C1 and x\u03c8 \u2286 y, then x \u2229 B = y \u2229 B. We prove this now. Proceeding, assume \u03c8 \u2208 C1 and x\u03c8 \u2286 y. If B\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 x, then B\u03c8B\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 x by (PI) and therefore B\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 y by x\u03c8 \u2286 y. So B\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 x implies B\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 y. Now suppose B\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 y. If we had B\u03c7\u03d5 /\u2208 x, it would follow by maximal consistency that \u00acB\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 x, hence B\u03c8\u00acB\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 x by (NI), and hence \u00acB\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 y, contradicting the consistency of y because B\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 y. So B\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 y implies B\u03c7\u03d5 \u2208 x. Conclusion: the Agreement Lemma obtains. Note that we obtain from this lemma by the definition of \u2264 that that x \u2264 y implies x\u2229B = y \u2229B.\nWe prove that \u2264 is reflexive. By the definition of \u2264, it suffices to prove that xx\u0304 \u2286 x. Proceeding, since Bx\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x implies Bx\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 B = \u22c3 0<i<\u03c9 BiC1, all we need do is prove by induction on i \u2265 1 that Bx\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x\u2229BiC1 implies \u03d5 \u2208 x.\n\u2022 Induction base: Bx\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x \u2229B1C1. We have \u03d5 \u2208 C1 and hence ` x\u0304 \u2192 \u03d5 or ` x\u0304 \u2192 \u00ac\u03d5. If ` x\u0304 \u2192 \u00ac\u03d5, then it follows by (SC) that Bx\u0304\u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 x. Since we also have Bx\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x, we obtain by modal reasoning that Bx\u0304\u22a5 \u2208 x, from which it follows by (WCon) that \u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x, a contradiction. Therefore it follows that ` x\u0304\u2192 \u03d5 and hence \u03d5 \u2208 x.\n\u2022 Induction step: we assume the result for i = 1, . . . , k and we prove the result for i = k + 1. Assume Bx\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x\u2229Bk+1C1. Since k \u2265 2, it follows that \u03d5 = B\u03c8\u03c7 or \u03d5 = \u00acB\u03c8\u03c7. Therefore, by (PR) or (NR) we have Bx\u0304\u22a5\u2228\u03d5 \u2208 x. As in the induction base, it follows by (WCon) that Bx\u0304\u22a5 /\u2208 x. Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 x.\nConclusion: \u2264 is reflexive. We prove that \u2264 is transitive. Proceeding, assume x \u2264 y \u2264 z. This means there exists a \u2208 (x \u2229 y \u2229 C1) and b \u2208 (y \u2229 z \u2229 C1) such that ya \u2286 x and zb \u2286 x. It follows that a \u2228 b \u2208 (x \u2229 z \u2229 C1), and so to conclude x \u2264 z, it suffices for us to prove that za\u2228b \u2286 x. Proceeding, we take an arbitrary Ba\u2228b\u03d5 \u2208 x and we seek to prove that \u03d5 \u2208 z. We consider two cases.\n\u2022 Case: Ba\u2228b\u00aca \u2208 z. Since Ba\u2228b(a \u2228 b) \u2208 z by (Succ), it follows by the assumption of this case and modal reasoning that Ba\u2228bb \u2208 z. Applying the latter and the assumption of the case again, we obtain by (CM) that B(a\u2228b)\u2227b\u00aca \u2208 z, from which it follows by (LE) that Bb\u00aca \u2208 z. But zb \u2286 y and therefore \u00aca \u2208 y. Since a \u2208 y, we have reached a contradiction. So this case cannot obtain, and so there is nothing more to prove.\n\u2022 Case: \u00acBa\u2228b\u00aca \u2208 z. From the assumption of this case and Ba\u2228b\u03d5 \u2208 z we obtain by (RM) that B(a\u2228b)\u2227a\u03d5 \u2208 z. Applying (LE), it follows that Ba\u03d5 \u2208 z. Hence BbBa\u03d5 \u2208 z by (PI). Since zb \u2286 y, it follows that Ba\u03d5 \u2208 y. Since ya \u2286 x, we obtain \u03d5 \u2208 x.\nConclusion: \u2264 is transitive. We prove that \u2264 is total on each connected component. Proceeding, suppose we have w \u2208 W and (x, y) \u2208 cc(w) \u00d7 cc(w). Since x \u2208 cc(w) and y \u2208 cc(w), it follows that v \u2264 w or w \u2264 v for each v \u2208 {x, y}. Applying the definition of \u2264 and the Agreement Lemma, we obtain x \u2229 B = y \u2229 B. We wish to prove that x \u2264 y or y \u2264 x. We consider two cases.\n\u2022 Case: Bx\u0304\u2228y\u0304\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x \u2229 y. By (Succ), we have Bx\u0304\u2228y\u0304(x\u0304 \u2228 y\u0304) \u2208 x \u2229 y. Applying the assumption of this case and modal reasoning, we obtain Bx\u0304\u2228y\u0304y\u0304 \u2208 x \u2229 y. We shall now prove that y \u2264 x. Proceeding, take an arbitrary Bx\u0304\u2228y\u03d5 \u2208 x. It follows from this by Bx\u0304\u2228y\u0304y\u0304 \u2208 x and (CM) that B(x\u0304\u2228y\u0304)\u2227y\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x. Applying (LE), we obtain By\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x. Since x \u2229 B = y \u2229 B, we have By\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 y. But we saw in the argument for reflexivity that yy\u0304 \u2286 y and therefore \u03d5 \u2208 y. So we have proved that for an arbitrary By\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 y, we obtain \u03d5 \u2208 y. That is, we have shown that xx\u0304\u2228y\u0304 \u2286 y. Since x\u0304 \u2228 y\u0304 \u2208 (x \u2229 y \u2229 C1), it follows that y \u2264 x.\n\u2022 Case: \u00acBx\u0304\u2228y\u0304\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x \u2229 y. We prove that x \u2264 y. Proceeding, take an arbitrary Bx\u0304\u2228y\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 y. It follows from this by the assumption of this case and (RM) that B(x\u0304\u2228y\u0304)\u2227x\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 y. Applying (LE), Bx\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 y. Since y \u2229B = x \u2229B, we obtain Bx\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x. But we saw in the argument for reflexivity that xx\u0304 \u2286 x and therefore \u03d5 \u2208 x. So we have proved that for an arbitrary Bx\u0304\u2228y\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 y, we obtain \u03d5 \u2208 x. That is, yx\u0304\u2228y\u0304 \u2286 x. Since x\u0304\u2228 y\u0304 \u2208 (x\u2229y\u2229C1), it follows that x \u2264 y.\nConclusion: \u2264 is total on each connected component. Since w\u03b8 \u2208 W , it follows that W is nonempty. Therefore, \u2264 is a reflexive and transitive binary relation over the nonempty finite set W , and \u2264 is total on each connected component. It follows from the finiteness of W that \u2264 is well-founded. Therefore, M is a locally well-ordered plausibility model. We now prove a few lemmas that will be of assistance.\nConsistency Lemma: for each x \u2208 W , if \u03c8 \u2208 x, then x\u03c8 is consistent. We prove this now. Proceeding, suppose x\u03c8 is not consistent. It follows that there exists a nonempty {\u03c71, . . . , \u03c7n} \u2286 x\u03c8 such that ` ( \u2227 i\u2264n \u03c7i) \u2192 \u22a5. By modal reasoning, ` ( \u2227 i\u2264nB\n\u03c8\u03c7i) \u2192 B\u03c8\u22a5. Since \u03c7i \u2208 x\u03c8 and hence B\u03c8\u03c7i \u2208 x for each i \u2264 n, it follows that B\u03c8\u22a5 \u2208 x. Applying (WCon), \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 x, which contradicts the consistency of x because we assumed \u03c8 \u2208 x. Conclusion: x\u03c8 is consistent.\nMinimality Lemma: for each \u03c8 \u2208 C1 and x \u2208 [\u03c8], where\n[\u03c8] := {x \u2208W | \u03c8 \u2208 x} ,\nwe have x \u2208 min[\u03c8] iff \u00acB\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x.\n\u2022 Left to right: for \u03c8 \u2208 C1 and x \u2208 [\u03c8], we prove x \u2208 min[\u03c8] implies \u00acB\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x. Assume \u03c8 \u2208 C1 and x \u2208 min[\u03c8]. Toward a contradiction, suppose B\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x. Applying the Consistency Lemma, x\u03c8 is consistent and so may be extended to a maximal consistent y \u2208 W . Since B\u03c8\u03c8 \u2208 x by (Succ), it follows that \u03c8 \u2208 y. And since B\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x, it follows that \u00acx\u0304 \u2208 y and therefore that y 6= x. But then \u03c8 \u2208 (x \u2229 y \u2229 C1) and y\u03c8 \u2286 x, from which it follows that y \u2264 x. Since y \u2208 [\u03c8], y \u2264 x, and x \u2208 min[\u03c8], it follows that x \u2264 y. That is, there exists \u03b4 \u2208 (x \u2229 y \u2229 C1) such that y\u03b4 \u2286 x. Now if we had B\u03c8\u00ac\u03b4 \u2208 x, then it would follow that \u00ac\u03b4 \u2208 y, contradicting the fact that \u03b4 \u2208 y. Hence \u00acB\u03c8\u00ac\u03b4 \u2208 x. Since B\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x as well, it follows by (RM) and (Comm) that B\u03b4\u2227\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x. Applying (Inc), B\u03b4(\u03c8 \u2192 \u00acx\u0304) \u2208 x. Since x \u2264 y implies x \u2229 B = y \u2229 B, it follows that B\u03b4(\u03c8 \u2192 \u00acx\u0304) \u2208 y, from which it follows by y\u03b4 \u2286 x that \u03c8 \u2192 \u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x. Since \u03c8 \u2208 x, we obtain \u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x, a contradiction. Our assumption B\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x must have been incorrect, and so we must have \u00acB\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x after all.\n\u2022 Right to left: for \u03c8 \u2208 C1 and x \u2208 [\u03c8], we prove \u00acB\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x implies x \u2208 min[\u03c8]. Assume \u03c8 \u2208 C1, x \u2208 [\u03c8] and, \u00acB\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x. It suffices to show that for each y \u2208 [\u03c8] \u2229 cc(x), we have x \u2264 y. Proceeding, take an arbitrary y \u2208 [\u03c8] \u2229 cc(x). It follows that y \u2229 B = x \u2229 B and that \u03c8 \u2208 (x \u2229 y \u2229 C1). So from \u00acB\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x we obtain \u00acB\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 y. Now take an arbitrary B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 y. It follows from this and \u00acB\u03c8\u00acx\u0304 \u2208 y by (RM) that B\u03c8\u2227x\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 y. Since \u03c8 \u2208 x \u2229 C1, we have ` x\u0304\u2192 \u03c8 and therefore it follows by (LE) that Bx\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 y. Since x \u2229 B = y \u2229 B, we obtain Bx\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x. However, we\nsaw in the argument for reflexivity that xx\u0304 \u2286 x, so it follows that \u03d5 \u2208 x. That is, we have shown that \u03c8 \u2208 (x\u2229 y \u2229C1) and y\u03c8 \u2286 x. Hence x \u2264 y. Since y \u2208 [\u03c8]\u2229 cc(x) was chosen arbitrarily and x \u2208 [\u03c8], it follows that x \u2208 min[\u03c8].\nThis completes the proof of the Minimality Lemma. Truth Lemma: for each \u03d5 \u2208 C1, we have [\u03d5] = J\u03d5KM . We prove this now. The proof is by induction on the construction of formulas in C1. The induction base case and Boolean induction step cases are standard, so we only consider the induction step case for formulas B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C1. Note: by the definition of C1, we have B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C1 iff B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C0. Further, from B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C0, it follows by the definition of C0 that \u03c8 \u2208 C0 and \u03d5 \u2208 C0.\n\u2022 Induction step B\u03c8\u03d5 (left to right): if x \u2208W and B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x \u2229 C1, then M,x |= B\u03c8\u03d5. Assume B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x \u2229 C1. If minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(x) = \u2205, then, since M is well-founded, the result follows immediately by Theorem 3.4. So assume minJ\u03c8K\u2229 cc(x) 6= \u2205 and take an arbitrary y \u2208 minJ\u03c8K\u2229 cc(x). Applying the induction hypothesis, y \u2208 min[\u03c8], from which it follows by the Minimality Lemma that \u00acB\u03c8\u00acy\u0304 \u2208 y. Since y \u2208 cc(x) implies x \u2229 B = y \u2229 B, it follows that \u00acB\u03c8\u00acy\u0304 \u2208 x. It follows from this by the assumption and (RM) that B\u03c8\u2227y\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x. Since \u03c8 \u2208 y \u2229 C1, we have ` y\u0304 \u2192 \u03c8 and therefore it follows from B\u03c8\u2227y\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x by (LE) that By\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 x. Since x\u2229B = y\u2229B, we have By\u0304\u03d5 \u2208 y. But as we saw that yy\u0304 \u2286 y in the argument for reflexivity, it follows that \u03d5 \u2208 y and hence that y \u2208 [\u03d5]. Applying the induction hypothesis, y \u2208 J\u03d5K. Since y \u2208 minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(x) was chosen arbitrarily, we have shown that minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(x) \u2286 J\u03d5K. Since M is well-founded, it follows by Theorem 3.4 that M,w |= B\u03c8\u03d5.\n\u2022 Induction step B\u03c8\u03d5 (right to left): if x \u2208W , B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C1, and M,x |= B\u03c8\u03d5, then B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x. Assume B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C1 and M,x |= B\u03c8\u03d5. Since M is well-founded, it follows by Theorem 3.4 that minJ\u03c8K \u2229 cc(x) \u2286 J\u03d5K. By the induction hypothesis, min[\u03c8] \u2229 cc(x) \u2286 [\u03d5]. We wish to prove that B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x. We consider two cases. Case: min[\u03c8] \u2229 cc(x) = \u2205. Since M is well-founded, it follows that [\u03c8] \u2229 cc(x) = \u2205. Toward a contradiction, assume B\u03c8\u22a5 /\u2208 x. Now if x\u03c8 were not consistent, then there would exist {\u03c71, . . . , \u03c7n} \u2286 x\u03c8 such that ` ( \u2227 i\u2264n \u03c7i) \u2192 \u22a5, from which it would follow by modal reasoning and the fact that\nB\u03c8\u03c7i \u2208 x for each i \u2264 n that B\u03c8\u22a5 \u2208 x, contradicting our assumption that B\u03c8\u22a5 /\u2208 x. So x\u03c8 is consistent after all, and we may extend this set to some y \u2208 W . Since B\u03c8\u03c8 \u2208 x by (Succ), it follows that \u03c8 \u2208 y and therefore that y \u2208 [\u03c8]. But [\u03c8] \u2229 cc(x) = \u2205, and so we must have that y /\u2208 cc(x). However, x\u03c8 \u2286 y, so it follows by the Agreement Lemma that x\u2229B = y\u2229B and hence xx\u0304\u2228y\u0304 = yx\u0304\u2228y\u0304. If xx\u0304\u2228y\u0304 were not consistent, then there would exist {\u03c71, . . . , \u03c7n} \u2286 xx\u0304\u2228y\u0304 such that ` ( \u2227 i\u2264n \u03c7i)\u2192 \u22a5, from which it would follow by modal reasoning and the fact that Bx\u0304\u2228y\u0304\u03c7i \u2208 x for each i \u2264 n that Bx\u0304\u2228y\u0304\u22a5 \u2208 x, from which we would obtain by (WCon) that \u00ac(x\u0304 \u2228 y\u0304) \u2208 x and hence that \u00acx\u0304 \u2208 x, a contradiction. So xx\u0304\u2228y\u0304 = yx\u0304\u2228y\u0304 is consistent and so may be extended to some z \u2208W . By (Succ), Bx\u0304\u2228y\u0304(x\u0304 \u2228 y\u0304) \u2208 x \u2229 y and therefore x\u0304 \u2228 y\u0304 \u2208 z. But then x\u0304 \u2228 y\u0304 \u2208 (x \u2229 y \u2229 z \u2229 C1), xx\u0304\u2228y\u0304 \u2286 z, and yx\u0304\u2228y\u0304 \u2286 z; that is, z \u2264 x and z \u2264 y, from which it follows that y \u2208 cc(x), a contradiction. Therefore our original assumption that B\u03c8\u22a5 /\u2208 x must have been incorrect, and so we must have B\u03c8\u22a5 \u2208 x after all. Applying modal reasoning, we obtain B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x, as desired. Case: min[\u03c8] \u2229 cc(x) 6= \u2205. It follows that there exists y \u2208 min[\u03c8] \u2229 cc(x). Toward a contradiction, assume B\u03c8\u03d5 /\u2208 y. If y\u03c8 \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} were not consistent, then we would have a finite {\u03c71, . . . , \u03c7n} \u2286 y\u03c8 such that ` ( \u2227 i\u2264n \u03c7i)\u2192 \u03d5, from which it would follow by modal reasoning and the fact that B\u03c8\u03c7i \u2208 y for each i \u2264 n that B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 y, contradicting the consistency of y by our assumption that B\u03c8\u03d5 /\u2208 y. So y\u03c8 \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} is indeed consistent and may be extended to some z \u2208 W . Since we have B\u03c8\u03c8 \u2208 y by (Succ), it follows that \u03c8 \u2208 z \u2229 y \u2229 C1. So since y\u03c8 \u2286 z, it follows that z \u2264 y. But then z \u2264 y, \u03c8 \u2208 z, and y \u2208 min[\u03c8]\u2229 cc(x), so it follows that z \u2208 min[\u03c8]\u2229 cc(x). Since min[\u03c8]\u2229 cc(x) \u2286 [\u03d5], it follows that \u03d5 \u2208 z. However, by the construction of z as a maximal consistent extension of y\u03c8 \u222a{\u00ac\u03d5}, we also have\n\u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 z. So z is inconsistent, a contradiction. It follows that our assumption \u00acB\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 y must have been incorrect and therefore we must have B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 y after all. Since y \u2208 cc(x), we have x \u2229B = y \u2229B and therefore that B\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x, as desired.\nThis completes the proof of the Truth Lemma. Since \u00ac\u03b8 \u2208 w\u03b8 \u2229 C1, it follows by the Truth Lemma that M,w\u03b8 6|= \u03b8. But then we have shown that 0 \u03b8 implies M 6|= \u03b8 for our locally well-founded model M \u2208 PL. Applying Theorem 3.6, 0 \u03b8 implies 6|= \u03d5. By contraposition, we have that |= \u03b8 implies ` \u03b8. So completeness obtains.\nA.3 Results for AGM revision\nProof of Theorem 4.1. For (a), assume T \u2208 BCPL is consistent. To say a S is maximal CPL-consistent means that S \u2286 LCPL, S is consistent, and adding to S any \u03c8 \u2208 LCPL not already present would result in a set that is inconsistent. We make tacit use of various well-known facts about maximal consistent sets. Let S be the collection of all maximal CPL-consistent sets. Let {\u03c8i}0<i<\u03c9 be an enumeration of LCPL. Define \u03c9+ := \u03c9 \u2212 {0} and S + \u03c8 := CPL(S \u222a {\u03c8}). Take\nW := {(S, 0) \u2208 S\u00d7 {0} | T \u2286 S} \u222a {(S, i) \u2208 S\u00d7 \u03c9+ | \u00ac\u03c8i \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205) and CPL(\u03c8i) \u2286 S} ,\n\u2264 := {((S, i), (S\u2032, i\u2032)) \u2208W \u00d7W | i \u2264 i\u2032} , V := {((S, i), P ) \u2208W \u00d7 \u2118(P) | P = S \u2229P} , M := (W,\u2264, V ) .\nSince T is consistent, it follows that there exists S \u2208 S such that S \u2287 T , which implies (S, 0) \u2208W . Therefore W 6= \u2205. Similarly, if i \u2208 \u03c9+ and \u00ac\u03c8i \u2208 CPL(T )\u2212 CPL(\u2205), then it follows that \u03c8i is consistent and therefore there exists S \u2208 S such that S \u2287 CPL(\u03c8i), which implies (S, i) \u2208 W . The relation \u2264 on W is a well-order because the relation \u2264 on \u03c9 is a well-order. So M is a well-ordered plausibility model.\nTruth Lemma: for each \u03d5 \u2208 LCPL and (S, i) \u2208 W , we have M, (S, i) |= \u03d5 iff \u03d5 \u2208 S. The proof is by induction on the construction of \u03d5 \u2208 LCPL. Induction base: if \u03d5 = \u22a5, then \u22a5 /\u2208 S since S is consistent and M, (S, i) 6|= \u22a5 by Definition 3.2. Induction base: if \u03d5 = p \u2208 P, then the result follows by the definition of V and Definition 3.2. Induction step: if \u03d5 = \u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52, then the result follows by the induction hypothesis and Definition 3.2. The lemma follows.\nTheory Lemma: for each \u03c8 \u2208 LCPL, we have\nM\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 =  T + \u03c8 if \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 T, CPL(\u03c8) if \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205), LCPL if \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 CPL(\u2205).\nWe prove this now by a case distinction. Proceeding, for each W \u2032 \u2286W , define\nT (W \u2032) := {\u03d5 \u2208 LCDL | \u2200w \u2208W \u2032 : M,w |= \u03d5} .\n\u2022 Case: \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 T . Let S\u03c8 := {S \u2208 S | S \u2287 T \u222a {\u03c8}}. It follows by the assumption of this case that S\u03c8 6= \u2205 and hence S\u03c8 \u00d7 {0} \u2286 W . By the Truth Lemma and the definition of \u2264, it follows that minJ\u03c8KM = S\u03c8 \u00d7 {0}. Now notice that since S \u2208 S\u03c8 is maximal CPL-consistent, it follows that for each S\u2032 \u2286 S we have CPL(S\u2032) \u2286 S. Therefore, since T \u222a {\u03c8} \u2286 S for each S \u2208 S\u03c8, it follows that T + \u03c8 \u2286 S for each S \u2208 S\u03c8. So T + \u03c8 \u2286 \u22c2 S\u03c8. Now if we had some \u03d5 \u2208 \u22c2 S\u03c8 such that \u03d5 /\u2208 T + \u03c8, then it would\nfollow that \u03d5 /\u2208 CPL(T \u222a{\u03c8}) and therefore we could extend T \u222a{\u03c8,\u00ac\u03d5} to a maximal CPL-consistent\nS \u2208 S\u03c8 having \u03d5 /\u2208 S, contradicting the fact that \u03d5 \u2208 \u22c2 S\u03c8. Therefore it must be the case that\u22c2\nS\u03c8 \u2286 T + \u03c8. Hence T + \u03c8 = \u22c2 S\u03c8. But then we have\nT (S\u03c8 \u00d7 {0}) = \u22c2 S\u03c8 = T + \u03c8 ,\nwhere the leftmost equality follows by the Truth Lemma. Since minJ\u03c8KM = S\u03c8 \u00d7 {0}, it follows by the definition of \u2217M that M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = T + \u03c8.\n\u2022 Case: \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205). Define S\u03c8 := {S \u2208 S | \u03c8 \u2208 S}. It follows by the definition of W that there exists j \u2208 \u03c9+ and S \u2208 S\u03c8 such that \u03c8j = \u03c8 and (S, j) \u2208 W . So let i \u2208 \u03c9+ be the least positive integer satisfying the property that there exists (S, i) \u2208W with \u03c8 \u2208 S. By the Truth Lemma, the definition of \u2264, and our choice of i, it follows that minJ\u03c8KM = S\u03c8 \u00d7{i}. Since S \u2208 S\u03c8 is maximal CPL-consistent, it follows that for each S\u2032 \u2286 S we have CPL(S\u2032) \u2286 S. Therefore, since \u03c8 \u2208 S for each S \u2208 S\u03c8, it follows that CPL(\u03c8) \u2286 S for each S \u2208 S\u03c8. So CPL(\u03c8) \u2286 \u22c2 S\u03c8. If we had some \u03d5 \u2208 \u22c2 S\u03c8 such that \u03d5 /\u2208 CPL(\u03c8), then we\ncould extend {\u03c8,\u00ac\u03d5} to a maximal CPL-consistent S \u2208 S\u03c8 having \u03d5 /\u2208 S, contradicting the fact that \u03d5 \u2208 \u22c2 S\u03c8. Therefore it must be the case that \u22c2 S\u03c8 \u2286 CPL(\u03c8). Hence CPL(\u03c8) = \u22c2 S\u03c8. But then we have T (S\u03c8 \u00d7 {i}) = \u22c2 S\u03c8 = CPL(\u03c8) ,\nwhere the leftmost equality follows by the Truth Lemma. Since minJ\u03c8KM = S\u03c8 \u00d7 {i}, it follows by the definition of \u2217M that M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = CPL(\u03c8).\n\u2022 Case: \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 CPL(\u2205). It follows from \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 CPL(\u2205) by the soundness of Classical Propositional Logic that 6|= \u03c8 and therefore minJ\u03c8KM = \u2205. Hence minJ\u03c8KM \u2286 J\u03d5KM for each \u03d5 \u2208 LCPL. Applying the definition of \u2217M , it follows that M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = LCPL.\nThe lemma follows. We now prove that M is a Grove system for T . First, since M\u2193 = L0, it follows by the Theory Lemma that M\u2193 = T . Second, we have already seen that M is a well-ordered plausibility model. So all that remains is to prove that M\u2193 \u2217M (\u2212) satisfies the AGM revision postulates. So given an arbitrary \u03c8 \u2208 LCPL, we check each postulate in turn.\n\u2022 Closure: M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = CPL(M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8). By the Theory Lemma, M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 is either T +\u03c8, CPL(\u03c8), or LCPL. However, for each of these sets S, we have CPL(S) = S.\n\u2022 Success: \u03c8 \u2208M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8. By the Theory Lemma, M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 is either T + \u03c8, CPL(\u03c8), or LCPL. However, each of these sets contains \u03c8.\n\u2022 Inclusion: M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 \u2286M\u2193 + \u03c8. By the Theory Lemma, M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 is T + \u03c8 if \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 T , is CPL(\u03c8) if \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205), and is LCPL if \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 CPL(\u2205). Further M\u2193 = T . Inclusion obviously follows for the case \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 T . for the case \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205), Inclusion follows because CPL(\u03c8) \u2286 T + \u03c8 = CPL(T \u222a {\u03c8}). For the case \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 CPL(\u2205), Inclusion follows because T + \u03c8 = CPL(T \u222a {\u03c8}) = LCPL.\n\u2022 Vacuity: if \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208M\u2193, then M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = M\u2193 + \u03c8. Since M\u2193 = T , the result follows by the Theory Lemma.\n\u2022 Consistency: if \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 CPL(\u2205), then \u22a5 /\u2208 CPL(M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8). If \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 CPL(\u2205), then either \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 T or \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205). Applying the Theory Lemma, M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 is either T + \u03c8 or CPL(\u03c8). Since T is consistent and we assumed \u03c8 is consistent, each of T + \u03c8 and CPL(\u03c8) is consistent. Hence \u22a5 /\u2208 CPL(M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8).\n\u2022 Extensionality: if (\u03c8 \u2194 \u03c8\u2032) \u2208 CPL(\u2205), then M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8\u2032. Assume (\u03c8 \u2194 \u03c8\u2032) \u2208 CPL(\u2205). It follows that T + \u03c8 = T + \u03c8\u2032 and CPL(\u03c8) = CPL(\u03c8\u2032). The result therefore follows by the Theory Lemma.\n\u2022 Superexpansion: M\u2193 \u2217M (\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) \u2286 (M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8) + \u03d5. Case: \u00ac(\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) /\u2208 T . By the Theory Lemma, M\u2193 \u2217M (\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) = T + (\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5). Since T is a theory, it follows from the assumption of this case that \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 T . Applying the Theory Lemma, M\u2193\u2217M \u03c8 = T+\u03c8. The result follows because\nT + (\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) = CPL(T \u222a {\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5}) = CPL(CPL(T \u222a {\u03c8}) \u222a {\u03d5}) = (T + \u03c8) + \u03d5 .\nCase: \u00ac(\u03c8\u2227\u03d5) \u2208 T \u2212CPL(\u2205). By the Theory Lemma, M\u2193 \u2217M (\u03c8\u2227\u03d5) = CPL(\u03c8\u2227\u03d5). If \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 T , then it follows by the Theory Lemma that M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = T + \u03c8 and hence\nCPL(\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) \u2286 CPL(T \u222a {\u03c8,\u03d5}) = CPL(CPL(T \u222a {\u03c8}) \u222a {\u03d5}) = (T + \u03c8) + \u03d5 .\nAnd if \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205), then it follows by the Theory Lemma that M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = CPL(\u03c8) and hence CPL(\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) = CPL({\u03c8} \u222a {\u03d5}) = CPL(\u03c8) + \u03d5. Finally, if \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 CPL(\u2205), then it follows by the Theory Lemma that M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = LCPL, from which we obtain\nCPL(\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) = LCPL = LCPL + \u03d5 .\nCase: \u00ac(\u03c8 \u2227\u03d5) \u2208 CPL(\u2205). By the Theory Lemma, M\u2193 \u2217M (\u03c8 \u2227\u03d5) = LCPL. If \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 T , then it follows by the Theory Lemma that M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = T +\u03c8; however, since \u03d5\u2227\u03c8 \u2208 (T +\u03c8) +\u03d5, it follows from the assumption of the case that (T + \u03c8) + \u03d5 = LCPL, which implies the result. And if \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205), then it follows by the Theory Lemma that M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = CPL(\u03c8); however, since \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 \u2208 CPL(\u03c8) + \u03d5, it follows from the assumption of the case that CPL(\u03c8) +\u03d5 = LCPL, which implies the result. Finally, if \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 CPL(\u2205), then it follows by the Theory Lemma that M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = LCPL and the result follows because LCPL + \u03d5 = LCPL.\n\u2022 Subexpansion: if \u00ac\u03d5 /\u2208 CPL(M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8), then (M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8) + \u03d5 \u2286M\u2193 \u2217M (\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5). Suppose \u00ac\u03d5 /\u2208 CPL(M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8). We consider a few cases. Case: \u00ac\u03c8 /\u2208 T . By the Theory Lemma, CPL(M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8) = CPL(T +\u03c8) = T +\u03c8. If \u00ac(\u03c8\u2227\u03d5) /\u2208 T , then it follows by the Theory Lemma that M\u2193 \u2217M (\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) = T + (\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5), from which we obtain the result because\n(T + \u03c8) + \u03d5 = CPL(CPL(T \u222a {\u03c8})\u222a {\u03d5}) = CPL(T \u222a {\u03c8} \u222a {\u03d5}) = CPL(T \u222a {\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5}) = T + (\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) .\nAnd if \u00ac(\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205), then we have (T + \u03c8) + \u03d5 = LCPL by the definition of +; however, we originally assumed that \u00ac\u03d5 /\u2208 CPL(M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8) = T + \u03c8, which implies (T + \u03c8) + \u03d5 6= LCPL, a contradiction that allows us to conclude that the hypothesis \u00ac(\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205) cannot obtain under the assumption of this case. Finally, if \u00ac(\u03c8\u2227\u03d5) \u2208 CPL(\u2205), then it follows by the Theory Lemma that M\u2193 \u2217M (\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) = LCDL, which trivially implies the result.\nCase: \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205). By the Theory Lemma, CPL(M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8) = CPL(CPL(\u03c8)) = CPL(\u03c8). Since T is a theory, it follows from the assumption of this case that \u00ac(\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) \u2208 T \u2212 CPL(\u2205). Applying the Theory Lemma, M\u2193 \u2217M (\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) = CPL(\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5). But then the result follows because\nCPL(\u03c8) + \u03d5 = CPL(CPL(\u03c8) \u222a {\u03d5}) = CPL({\u03c8} \u222a {\u03d5}) = CPL(\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5) .\nCase: \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 CPL(\u2205). By the Theory Lemma CPL(M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8) = CPL(LCPL) = LCPL. It follows from the assumption of this case that \u00ac(\u03c8 \u2227\u03d5) \u2208 CPL(\u2205). Applying the Theory Lemma, M\u2193 \u2217M \u03c8 = LCPL. The result follows.\nConclusion: M is a Grove system for T . For (b), if T is inconsistent, then since M\u2217 is a system of spheres, it follows that T \u2217 (\u2212) = M\u2193\u2217 \u2217M (\u2212) satisfies the AGM revision postulates. And if T is consistent, then since T \u2217\u03c8 = T \u2217MT \u03c8 and MT is a Grove system for T , we have M\u2193 = T and that M is a system of spheres; therefore, T \u2217MT (\u2212) = T \u2217 (\u2212) satisfies the AGM revision postulates. Conclusion: \u2217 is an AGM revision operator.\nA.4 Results for JCDL\nProof of Lemma 5.5. For this argument, a derivation is a JCDL-derivation. We wish to establish the following result:\n\u03c0 `nJCDL \u03d5 \u21d2 \u2203\u03c0\u2217 \u2287 \u03c0, \u03c0\u2217 `0JCDL \u03d5 . (10)\nThe proof of (10), an adaptation of [3, Lemma 4.6] to the present setting, is by induction on n with a sub-induction on the length |\u03c0| of \u03c0.\n\u2022 Induction base: n = 0. Take \u03c0\u2217 = \u03c0.\n\u2022 Induction step: assume the result holds for all m < n (this is the \u201cinduction hypothesis\u201d), and prove it holds for n by a sub-induction on |\u03c0|.\nSub-induction base: |\u03c0| = 1. Since \u03c0 contains a single line, \u03d5 is an axiom and therefore \u03c0 `0JCDL \u03d5. Take \u03c0\u2217 = \u03c0.\nSub-induction step: assume the result holds for all derivations \u03c0\u2032 having |\u03c0\u2032| < |\u03c0| (this is the \u201csubinduction hypothesis\u201d), and prove it holds for \u03c0. Proceeding, assume \u03c0 `nJCDL \u03d5. If \u03c0 `0JCDL \u03d5, we are done. So let us assume further that \u03c0 00JCDL \u03d5. Therefore\n\u03c0 = \u03b81, . . . , \u03b8|\u03c0|\u22121, \u03d5\ncontains at least one troublesome necessitation. It follows that there exists a shortest prefix \u03c0\u2032 of \u03c0 whose last line is a troublesome necessitation: we have\n\u03c0\u2032 = \u03b81, . . . , \u03b8|\u03c0\u2032|\u22121, B\u0307 \u03b4\u03b8m\nwith |\u03c0\u2032| the minimum value such that B\u0307\u03b4\u03b8m neither is not a possibly necessitated axiom nor follows from a previous line by (MP). We consider two cases.\nCase: |\u03c0\u2032| < |\u03c0|. By the sub-induction hypothesis, there exists \u03c0\u2032\u2217 \u2287 \u03c0\u2032 such that \u03c0\u2032\u2217 `0JCDL B\u0307\u03b4\u03b8m. Let \u03c3 be the suffix of \u03c0 such that \u03c0\u2032\u03c3 = \u03c0, where we have denoted sequence concatenation by juxtaposition. Since \u03c0\u2032\u2217 is a derivation and \u03c0 \u2032 \u2217 \u2287 \u03c0\u2032, it follows that \u03c0\u2032\u2217\u03c3 is a derivation and this derivation has the same last line as \u03c0. Therefore, since we chose \u03c0\u2032 as the shortest prefix \u03c0\u2032 of \u03c0 whose last line is a troublesome necessitation, we have \u03c0\u2032\u2217\u03c3 `n\u22121JCDL \u03d5. Applying the induction hypothesis, it follows that there exists a derivation \u03c0\u2217 \u2287 \u03c0\u2032\u2217\u03c3 \u2287 \u03c0\u2032\u03c3 = \u03c0 such that \u03c0\u2217 `0JCDL \u03d5.\nCase: \u03c0\u2032 = \u03c0. Hence \u03d5 = B\u0307\u03b4\u03b8m. Since the shortest prefix of \u03c0 whose last line is a troublesome necessitation is \u03c0 itself, it follows that \u03c0 `1JCDL B\u0307\u03b4\u03b8m. But then \u03b8m is not a troublesome necessitation. Moreover, \u03b8m is not a possibly necessitated axiom (since if it were, B\u0307\n\u03b4\u03b8m would not be a troublesome necessitation, contrary to our assumption implying that it is). So \u03b8m must follow by way of (MN) from lines \u03b8n \u2192 \u03b8m and \u03b8n appearing earlier in \u03c0 than line m. That is,\n\u03c0 = \u03c3, \u03b8m, \u03c4,X\u03b8m\nwith both \u03b8n \u2192 \u03b8m and \u03b8n in \u03c3\nwhere \u03c3 and \u03c4 denote sequences of formulas (and we note that \u03c4 may be empty). By (eMN), we have derivations\n\u03c01 = \u03c3, B\u0307\u03b4\u03b8n with |\u03c01| \u2264 m < |\u03c0| \u03c02 = \u03c3, B\u0307\u03b4(\u03b8n \u2192 \u03b8m) with |\u03c02| \u2264 m < |\u03c0|\nsuch that \u03c01 `1JCDL B\u0307\u03b4\u03b8n and \u03c02 `1JCDL B\u0307\u03b4(\u03b8n \u2192 \u03b8m). Applying the sub-induction hypothesis to \u03c01 and to \u03c02, there exist \u03c01\u2217 \u2287 \u03c01 and \u03c02\u2217 \u2287 \u03c02 such that \u03c01\u2217 `0JCDL B\u0307\u03b4\u03b8n and \u03c02\u2217 `0JCDL B\u0307\u03b4(\u03b8n \u2192 \u03b8m). Recalling the abbreviation B\u0307\u03b4\u03c7 = c\u03c7 : \u03b4\u03c7 and making use of an instance of (eK), the sequence\n\u03c0\u2217 = \u03c0 1 \u2217, \u03c0 2 \u2217, \u03b8m, \u03c4,\nB\u0307\u03b4(\u03b8n \u2192 \u03b8m)\u2192 (B\u0307\u03b4\u03b8n \u2192 (c\u03b8n\u2192\u03b8m \u00b7 c\u03b8n) :\u03b4\u03b8m), B\u0307\u03b4\u03b8n \u2192 (c\u03b8n\u2192\u03b8m \u00b7 c\u03b8n) :\u03b4\u03b8m, (c\u03b8n\u2192\u03b8m \u00b7 c\u03b8n) :\u03b4\u03b8m\nis a derivation satisfying \u03c0\u2217 \u2287 \u03c0 and \u03c0\u2217 `0JCDL \u03d5.\nThis completes the proof that (10) holds.\nProof of Theorem 5.6. In light of Lemma 5.5, to prove the statement of the present theorem, it suffices to prove the following: if `0JCDL \u03d5, then there exists a logical term t such that `0JCDL t :\u03b4\u03d5. This we prove by induction on the length of derivation.\n\u2022 Induction base and induction step for (eMN): \u03d5 is a possibly necessitated axiom. It follows that `0JCDL c\u03d5 :\u03b4\u03d5 for the logical term c\u03d5.\n\u2022 Induction step for (MP): we assume `0JCDL \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 and `0JCDL \u03d5 along with the following \u201cinduction hypothesis\u201d: there exist logical terms t and s such that `0JCDL t :\u03b4(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) and `0JCDL s :\u03b4\u03d5. But then it follows by the induction hypothesis, (eK), and two applications of (MP) that `0JCDL (t \u00b7 s) :\u03b4\u03c8 for the logical term t \u00b7 s.\nThe result follows.\nProof of Theorem 5.9. For Item 1, we prove by induction on the length of derivation in JCDL from hypotheses \u0393 that\n\u0393 `JCDL \u03d5 implies \u0393\u25e6 `CDL \u03d5\u25e6 .\n\u2022 Induction base for hypotheses: if \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393, then \u03d5\u25e6 \u2208 \u0393\u25e6. So \u0393\u25e6 `CDL \u03d5\u25e6.\n\u2022 Induction base for axioms: \u03d5 is an axiom. But for each axiom scheme (eX) of JCDL for which there is a \u201cmatching\u201d axiom scheme (X) of CDL, the forgetful projection of an instance of the JCDL axiom is an instance of the matching CDL scheme. Regarding the three remaining JCDL schemes (eSum), (eCert), and (eA) that have no matching CDL scheme: each of (eSum) and (eCert) is mapped to an instance of the CDL-theorem p \u2192 p, and (eA) is mapped to an instance of the CDL-theorem q \u2192 (p \u2192 p). Conclusion: \u0393\u25e6 `CDL \u03d5\u25e6.\n\u2022 Induction step for (MP): we assume the result holds for JCDL-theorems \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 and \u03d5 derived from hypotheses \u0393, and we prove that \u0393\u25e6 `CDL \u03c8\u25e6. By our assumption, \u03d5\u25e6 \u2192 \u03c8\u25e6 and \u03d5\u25e6 are CDL-theorems derived from hypotheses \u0393\u25e6. Applying (MP), \u03c8\u25e6 as a CDL-theorem derived from hypotheses \u0393\u25e6.\n\u2022 Induction step for (eMN): we assume the result holds for the JCDL-theorem \u03d5 derived from hypotheses \u0393, and we prove that the result holds for the JCDL-theorem B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 derived from hypotheses \u0393; that is, we prove that \u0393\u25e6 `CDL (B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5)\u25e6. By our assumption, \u03d5\u25e6 is a CDL-theorem derived from hypotheses \u0393\u25e6. Applying (MN) and the definition of the forgetful projection, B\u03c8 \u25e6 \u03d5\u25e6 = (B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5)\u25e6 is a CDL-theorem\nderived from hypotheses in \u0393\u25e6.\nThis completes the proof of Item 1. For Item 2, we by induction on the length of derivation in CDL from hypotheses \u2206 that\n\u2206 `CDL \u03c8 implies \u2206t `JCDL \u03c8t .\n\u2022 Induction base for hypotheses: If \u03c8 \u2208 \u2206, then \u03c8t \u2208 \u2206t. So \u2206t `CDL \u03c8t.\n\u2022 Induction base for axiom scheme: \u03c8 is an axiom scheme of CDL, so we consider each possibility.\n\u2013 (CL)t is an instance of (CL) and therefore a JCDL-derivable from hypotheses \u2206t. \u2013 (K)t is the scheme B\u0307\u03b3 t (\u03d5t1 \u2192 \u03d5t2)\u2192 (B\u0307\u03b3 t \u03d5t1 \u2192 B\u0307\u03b3 t \u03d5t2).

By our assumption,\n(\u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52)t = \u03d5t1 \u2192 \u03d5t2 and \u03d5t1 is a JCDL-theorem derivable from hypotheses \u2206t. So it follows by (MN) that \u03d5t2 is a JCDL-theorem derivable from hypotheses \u2206t as well.\n\u2022 Induction step for (MN): we assume the result holds for the CDL-theorem \u03d5 derived from hypotheses \u2206, and we prove the result holds for the CDL-theorem B\u03b3\u03d5 derived from hypotheses \u2206; that is, we prove that \u2206t `JCDL (B\u03b3\u03d5)t.

This proof uses much of the work from the proof of Theorem 3.13 (the \u201cold proof\u201d). In utilizing portions of the argument from the old proof in the present argument (the \u201cnew proof\u201d), we adopt the following conventions (the \u201cJCDL-conventions\u201d):\n\u2022 the language (and set of formulas) is assumed to be LJCDL;\n\u2022 occurrences of \u201cB \u201d from the old proof are replaced by occurrences of \u201cB\u0307 \u201d;\n\u2022 truth or validity for CDL is replaced by truth or validity for JCDL;\n\u2022 use of Theorem 3.4 or 3.4 is replaced by use of Theorem 5.16;\n\u2022 use of Theorem 3.6 is replaced by Theorem 5.18;\n\u2022 derivability in CDL is replaced by derivability in JCDL\n\u2022 use of the non-subscripted turnstile ` denotes `JCDL;\n\u2022 use of Theorem 3.11 is replaced by Theorem 5.11; and\n\u2022 use of a derivable principle (X) of CDL (perhaps by tacit use of Theorem 3.11) is replaced by use of the corresponding derivable principle (eX) of JCDL (with corresponding tacit use of Theorem 5.11 when appropriate).\nHaving established the above JCDL-conventions and the \u201cold/new proof\u201d terminology, we proceed. For soundness, we proceed by induction on the length of derivation. In the induction base, we must show that each axiom scheme is valid. (CL) is straightforward, so we proceed with the remaining schemes. Let (M,w) be an arbitrary well-ordered pointed Fitting model. We make tacit use of Theorems 2.3(3) and 5.15.\n(eCert) is valid |= t :\u03c8\u03d5\u2192 B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5. Assume (M,w) satisfies t :\u03c8\u03d5. Then w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K.

Hence minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d52K and, by Application (Definition 5.12), w \u2208 A(t \u00b7 s, \u03d52).

Then w \u2208 A(t,\u22a5) and minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u22a5K. It follows from the latter by the old proof that minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K \u2286 J\u22a5K.

And it follows from t :\u03c8\u03c7 that w \u2208 A(t, \u03c7) and minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03c7K. By the old proof, we have by minJ\u03c8K * J\u03d5K and minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03c7K that minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K \u2286 J\u03c7K. Since w \u2208 A(t, \u03c7), we conclude that (M,w) satisfies t :\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7.\n(eInc) is valid: |= t :\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7\u2192 B\u0307\u03c8(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c7). Suppose (M,w) satisfies t :\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7. Then w \u2208 A(t, \u03c7) and minJ\u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5K \u2286 J\u03c7K. It follows from the latter by the old proof that minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5\u2192 \u03c7K. Conclusion: (M,w) satisfies B\u0307\u03c8(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c7).\n(eComm) is valid: |= t :\u03c8\u2227\u03d5\u03c7\u2192 t :\u03d5\u2227\u03c8\u03c7.

Conclusion: (M,w) satisfies t :\u03d5\u2227\u03c8\u03c7.\n(ePI) is valid: |= t :\u03c8\u03c7\u2192 B\u0307\u03d5(t :\u03c8\u03c7). Suppose (M,w) satisfies t :\u03c8\u03c7. Then w \u2208 A(t, \u03c7) and minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03c7K. The latter implies that (M,v) satisfies B\u0307\u03c8\u03c7 for any given v \u2208 W . Since M is well-ordered, we have v \u2208 cc(w) for each v \u2208 W , and therefore it follows from w \u2208 A(t, \u03c7) by Admissibility Indefeasibility (Definition 5.12) that A(t, \u03c7) = W . But then for each v \u2208 W , we have v \u2208 A(t, \u03c7) and M, v |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03c7. Applying Theorem 5.14, we have for each v \u2208 W that M,v |= t :\u03c8\u03c7. Therefore, Jt :\u03c8\u03c7K = W , from which it follows that minJ\u03d5K \u2286 Jt :\u03c8\u03c7K. Applying Theorem 5.16, we conclude that (M,w) satisfies B\u0307\u03d5(t :\u03c8\u03c7).\n(eNI) is valid: |= \u00act :\u03c8\u03c7\u2192 B\u0307\u03d5(\u00act :\u03c8\u03c7).

Since M is well-ordered, we have v \u2208 cc(w) for each v \u2208 W , and so it follows from w /\u2208 A(t, \u03d5) by Admissibility Indefeasibility (Definition 5.12) that A(t, \u03d5) = \u2205. Therefore, J\u00act :\u03c8\u03c7K = W , from which it follows that minJ\u03d5K \u2286 J\u00act :\u03c8\u03c7K. Applying Theorem 5.16, we conclude that (M,w) satisfies B\u0307\u03d5(\u00act :\u03c8\u03c7).\nCase: minJ\u03c8K * J\u03c7K. It follows that M, v |= \u00act :\u03c8\u03c7 for each v \u2208 cc(w) = W . Therefore, J\u00act :\u03c8\u03c7K = W , from which it follows that minJ\u03d5K \u2286 J\u00act :\u03c8\u03c7K.

Suppose (M,w) satisfies t :\u03c8\u03d5 and B\u0307\u03c7\u03d5. Then w \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and minJ\u03c7K \u2286 J\u03d5K. Conclusion: (M,w) satisfies t :\u03c7\u03d5.\nThis completes the induction base. For the induction step, we must show that validity is preserved under the rules of (MP) and (eMN). The argument for (MP) is standard, so let us focus on (eMN). We assume |= \u03d5 for the JCDL-derivable \u03d5 (this is the \u201cinduction hypothesis\u201d), and we prove that |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5. Proceeding, since |= \u03d5, it follows that J\u03d5K = W and hence that minJ\u03c8K \u2286 J\u03d5K. By Certification (Definition 5.12, A(c\u03d5, \u03d5) = W . But then (M,w) satisfies c\u03d5 :\n\u03c8\u03d5 = B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5. Soundness has been proved. Since JCDL is sound with respect to the class of well-ordered Fitting models we note that JCDL is consistent (i.e., 0JCDL \u22a5). In particular, take any pointed Fitting model (M,w) containing only the single world w. It is simple to construct such a model: take\nM := ({w}, {(w,w)}, {(w, \u2205)}, A) ,\nwhere A is the \u201ctotal\u201d admissibility function defined by setting A(t, \u03d5) := W for all (t, \u03d5) \u2208 TJCDL\u00d7LJCDL. It is obvious that the requisite properties from Definition 5.12 obtain. Since there is only one world, M is well-ordered. Further, by soundness, we have that `JCDL \u03d5 implies M,w |= \u03d5. Therefore, since M,w 6|= \u22a5 by Definition 5.13, it follows that 0JCDL \u22a5. That is, JCDL is consistent. We make use of this fact tacitly in what follows.\nFor completeness, take a formula \u03b8 such that 0 \u00ac\u03b8. Define consistency, inconsistency, maximal consistency in (\u201cmaxcons in\u201d) a set of formulas, the set sub(\u03d5) of subformulas of \u03d5 (including \u03d5 itself), the set sub(S) containing all subformulas of each formula in the set S (including the formulas themselves), and the Boolean closure \u2295S as in the old proof (but of course using the JCDL-conventions). For a set S of formulas, we define:\n~BS := S \u222a {B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 | t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 S} , \u00b1S := S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2208 S} , B\u03070S := S ,\nB\u0307i+1S := \u00b1{B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 | \u03c8 \u2208 S and \u03d5 \u2208 B\u0307iS} , B\u0307\u03c9S := \u22c3 0<i<\u03c9 B\u0307iS ,\nC0 := \u00b1 ~B sub({\u03b8,\u22a5,>}) , C1 := \u2295C0 , B\u0307 := B\u0307\u03c9C1 ,\nC := C1 \u222a B\u0307 , T0 := \u00b1{t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 LJCDL | t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C0} .\nKey differences from the old proof:\n\u2022 the new operator ~BS adds the \u201ccertified version\u201d B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 = c\u03d5 :\u03c8\u03d5 of each formula t :\u03c8\u03d5 in S,\n\u2022 C0 has been changed by adding the operator ~B,\n\u2022 every \u201cB \u201d in the old proof has been replaced by \u201cB\u0307 \u201d,\n\u2022 we use the JCDL-conventions (e.g., we are working in the language of JCDL), and\n\u2022 the set T0 (used later) is new.\nWe then define:\nW := {x \u2286 C | x is maxcons in C} , x\u0304 := \u2227 (x \u2229 C0) for x \u2208W , x\u03c8 := {\u03d5 | B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x} for x \u2208W and \u03c8 \u2208 C1 , \u2264 := {(x, y) \u2208W \u00d7W | \u2203\u03c8 \u2208 (x \u2229 y \u2229 C1), y\u03c8 \u2286 x} ,\nV (x) := P \u2229 x for x \u2208W , x\u0302 := \u2227 (x \u2229 T0) for x \u2208W ,\nA(t, \u03d5) := {x \u2208W | \u2203\u03c8 \u2208 LJCDL, ` x\u0302\u2192 t :\u03c8\u03d5} , M := (W,\u2264, V, A) .\nKey differences from the old proof:\n\u2022 every \u201cB \u201d in the old proof has been replaced by \u201cB\u0307 \u201d,\n\u2022 the mapping taking a world x \u2208W to a formula x\u0302 is new,\n\u2022 the function A of type (TJCDL \u00d7LJCDL)\u2192 \u2118(W ) is new, and\n\u2022 M has been expanded to contain A.\nThe arguments in the old proof (modulo the JCDL-conventions) are used to prove W is finite and nonempty, \u2264 is reflexive and transitive, \u2264 is total on each connected component, and \u2264 is well-founded.

(11)\nProceeding, suppose y \u2208 cc(x). Since \u2264 is total on each connected component, we may assume without loss of generality that x \u2264 y. (The case where y \u2264 x is argued similarly.) Now x \u2264 y implies there exists \u03b4 \u2208 (x \u2229 y \u2229 C1) such that y\u03b4 \u2286 x. For the left-to-right direction: suppose t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x \u2229 C1. If we had t :\u03c8\u03d5 /\u2208 y, then it would follow by maximal consistency that \u00act :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 y, hence B\u0307\u03b4(\u00act :\u03c8\u03d5) \u2208 y by (eNI), hence \u00act :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x by y\u03b4 \u2286 x, thereby contradicting the consistency of x. So it must be the case that t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 y after all. Now for the right-to-left direction: suppose t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 y \u2229 C1. It follows by (ePI) that B\u0307\u03b4(t :\u03c8\u03d5) \u2208 y. Since y\u03b4 \u2286 x, we obtain t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x. So (11) indeed obtains.\nIn order to conclude that M is a Fitting model, we must prove that A satisfies the properties required of an admissibility function (Definition 5.12). We state and prove these in turn.\n\u2022 Certification: A(c\u03d5, \u03d5) = W . Take an arbitrary x \u2208 W . We have ` x\u0302 \u2192 B\u0307\u03d5\u03d5 by (Succ). Since B\u0307\u03d5\u03d5 = c\u03d5 :\u03d5\u03d5, it follows that ` x\u0302 \u2192 c\u03d5 :\u03d5\u03d5. Applying the definition of A, we obtain x \u2208 A(c\u03d5, \u03d5). Since x \u2208 W was chosen arbitrarily, we conclude that A(c\u03d5, \u03d5) = W .\n\u2022 Application: A(t, \u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52) \u2229A(s, \u03d51) \u2286 A(t \u00b7 s, \u03d52). Assume x \u2208 A(t, \u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52) \u2229 A(s, \u03d51). Applying the definition of A, this means there exists \u03c81 \u2208 LJCDL and \u03c82 \u2208 LJCDL such that ` x\u0302 \u2192 t :\u03c81(\u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52) and ` x\u0302 \u2192 s :\u03c82\u03d51. Now we have each of ` B\u03d51\u2227\u03d52(\u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52) and ` B\u03d51\u2227\u03d52\u03d51 by (Succ) and modal reasoning. So it follows that\n` x\u0302\u2192 t :\u03c81(\u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52) \u2227B\u03d51\u2227\u03d52(\u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52) \u2227 s :\u03c82\u03d51 \u2227B\u03d51\u2227\u03d52\u03d51 .\nApplying (eA), we obtain ` x\u0302\u2192 t :\u03d51\u2227\u03d52(\u03d51 \u2192 \u03d52) \u2227 s :\u03d51\u2227\u03d52\u03d51 ,\nfrom which it follows by (eK) that ` x\u0302\u2192 (t \u00b7 s) :\u03d51\u2227\u03d52\u03d52. Applying the definition of A, it follows that x \u2208 A(t \u00b7 s, \u03d52).\n\u2022 Sum: A(t, \u03d5) \u222aA(s, \u03d5) \u2286 A(t+ s, \u03d5). Suppose x \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) \u222a A(s, \u03d5). Applying the definition of A, this means there exists \u03c8t \u2208 LJCDL such that ` x\u0302\u2192 t :\u03c8t\u03d5 or there exists \u03c8s \u2208 LJCDL such that ` x\u0302\u2192 s :\u03c8s\u03d5. Applying (eSum), it follows that ` x\u0302\u2192 (t+s) :\u03c8\u03d5 for some \u03c8 \u2208 {\u03c8t, \u03c8s}. But then we obtain by the definition of A that x \u2208 A(t+s, \u03d5).\n\u2022 Admissibility Indefeasibility: if x \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and y \u2208 cc(x), then y \u2208 A(t, \u03d5). Suppose x \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and y \u2208 cc(x). It follows from x \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) by the definition of A that there exists \u03c8 \u2208 LJCDL such that ` x\u0302 \u2192 t :\u03c8\u03d5. But y \u2208 cc(x), and so it follows by (11) that y\u0302 = x\u0302. Therefore ` y\u0302 \u2192 t :\u03c8\u03d5, from which it follows by the definition of A that y \u2208 A(t, \u03d5).\nSo A satisfies the properties required of an admissibility function. Since W is nonempty, A satisfies the properties of an admissibility function, and \u2264 is a locally wellordered, it follows that M is a locally well-ordered Fitting model. The arguments in the old proof (modulo the JCDL-conventions) are then used to prove that the Consistency Lemma holds and that the Minimality Lemma holds.\nBy the old proof (modulo the JCDL-conventions), all of the induction base and step cases of the Truth Lemma hold, except for the induction step case for formulas t :\u03c8\u03d5. What remains is to check this remaining case. Before we do this, note: by the definition of C1 as the Boolean closure of C0, it follows from t :\n\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C1 that t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C0 and therefore t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 T0. We now proceed with the argument.\n\u2022 Induction step t :\u03c8\u03d5 (left to right): if x \u2208W and t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x \u2229 C1, then M,x |= t :\u03c8\u03d5. Assume t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x \u2229 C1. By (eCert) and the definition of C1, it follows that B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x \u2229 C1. Using the old proof (modulo the JCDL-conventions and using Theorem 5.16 in place of Theorem 3.4), we obtain M,x |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5. Also, since t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x\u2229C1 implies t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x\u2229 T0, it follows that ` x\u0302\u2192 t :\u03c8\u03d5, from which we obtain x \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) by the definition of A. So since x \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) and M,x |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5, it follows by Theorem 5.14 that M,x |= t :\u03c8\u03d5.\n\u2022 Induction step t :\u03c8\u03d5 (right to left): if x \u2208W , t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C1, and M,x |= t :\u03c8\u03d5, then t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x. Assume t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C1 and M,x |= t :\u03c8\u03d5. By Theorem 5.14, it follows that M,x |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 and x \u2208 A(t, \u03d5). Using the old proof (modulo the JCDL-conventions and using Theorem 5.16 in place of Theorem 3.4), it follows from M,x |= B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 that B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x. Applying the definition of A, it follows from x \u2208 A(t, \u03d5) that there exists \u03c7 \u2208 LJCDL such that ` x\u0302 \u2192 t :\u03c7\u03d5. But then we have ` x\u0302 \u2192 t :\u03c7\u03d5 \u2227 B\u0307\u03c8\u03d5. Applying (eA), we obtain ` x\u0302 \u2192 t :\u03c8\u03d5. Since t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 C1 implies t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 T0, it follows from ` x\u0302 \u2192 t :\u03c8\u03d5 by the maximal consistency of x in C \u2287 T0 that t :\u03c8\u03d5 \u2208 x.\nThis completes the proof of the Truth Lemma. We then apply the argument as in the old proof (modulo the JCDL-conventions and using Theorem 5.18 in place of Theorem 3.6) to conclude that JCDL is complete with respect to the class of well-ordered Fitting models."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change: partial meet contraction and revision functions", "author": ["C.E.
