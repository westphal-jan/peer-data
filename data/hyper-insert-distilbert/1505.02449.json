For a formal, mechanical proof, this can be problematic, not only because we need to account for the logical validity of the transformation, but because if we want a computational system to find a proof like a mathematician would, we need to be able to incorporate something like the esoteric transformations going on inside the mathematician\u2019s mind into the mechanical search.\n\u22c6 The final publication is available at http://link.springer.com. \u22c6\u22c6 This work has been supported by a scholarship from the Mexican Council of Science\nand Technology (CONACYT).\nThe importance of representational changes in mathematics is evidenced in historically notable works like Kurt Go\u0308del\u2019s incompleteness theorems, where the proof involves matching (or encoding) meta-theoretical concepts like \u2018sentence\u2019 and \u2018proof\u2019 as natural numbers, or more recently Andrew Wiles\u2019 proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, which involves matching the Galois representations of elliptic curves with modular forms. This phenomenon is also seen in refinement based formal methods (e.g. VDM and B): one starts with a highly abstract representation that is easy to reason with, and then it is step-wise refined to a very concrete representation that can be implemented as a computer program. All of these transformations are justified by a general notion of morphism.\nIn this paper we give an overview of a general mathematical framework suitable for reasoning about representational changes in type-theoretic higher-order logics (these are transformations/morphisms between structures that land us in different theories). We see that the operation of Isabelle\u2019s transfer methods [6] fit into this notion of transformation. It is a way of mechanising inference between two domains, if the system is provided with a transformation by the user. We present a set of transformations we have identified as essential for reasoning in discrete mathematics, and show how we have used the transfer tool to implement mechanical proofs in Isabelle that use these transformations. We show our work towards automating the search for representation as a tactic for use within proofs in discrete mathematics in Isabelle."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "Isabelle/HOL is a theorem proving framework based on a simple type-theoretical higher-order logic [9]. It is one of the most widely used proof assistants for the mechanisation of proofs. Apart from ensuring the correctness of proofs written in its formal language, Isabelle has powerful automatic tactics like simp and auto, and through time it has been enriched with some internally-verified theorem provers like metis [7] and smt [11], along with a connection from the internal provers to some very powerful external provers like E, SPASS, Vampire, CVC3 and Z3 through the Sledgehammer tool [10].\nThe Transfer package was first released for Isabelle 2013-1 as a general mechanism for defining quotient types and transferring knowledge from the old \u2018representation\u2019 type into the new \u2018abstract\u2019 type [6]. However, their generalisation is not restricted to the definition of new quotient types, but allows the user to relate any two types by theorems of a specific shape called transfer rules. Some of these rules can be defined automatically when the user defines a new quotient type, but the user is free to add them manually, provided that they prove a preservation theorem. Central to this package, the transfer and transfer \u2032 tactics try to automatically match the goal sentence to a new one related by either equivalence or implication, inferring this relation from the transfer rules.\nWe have taken full advantage of the generality of the transfer package as a means of automating the translation between sentences across domains which are related by what we consider an appropriate and general notion of structural transformation. In Section 4 we give an overview of our notion of transformation\nand how the tactics of the transfer package are useful mechanisms for exploiting the knowledge of a structural transformation."}, {"heading": "3 Overall vision", "text": "The worlds of mathematical entities are interconnected. Numbers can be represented as sets, pairs of sets, lists of digits, bags of primes, etc. Some representations are only foundational and the reasoner often finds it more useful to discard the representation for practical use (e.g., natural number 3 is represented by {\u2205, {\u2205}, {\u2205, {\u2205}}} in the typical ZF foundations, but this representation is rarely used in practice), and some are emergent ; they only come about after a fair amount of accumulated knowledge about the objects themselves, but are more helpful as reasoning tools (e.g., natural numbers as bags of primes). Overall, we think that there is no obvious notion of \u2018better representation\u2019, and it\u2019s up to the reasoner to choose, depending on the task at hand. Thus, we envision a system where the representation of entities can be fluidly transformed.\nWe have looked at problems in discrete mathematics and the transformations commonly used for solving them. Below, we give one motivating example and show how we have mechanised the transformation in question inside Isabelle/HOL. Other motivating examples are briefly mentioned."}, {"heading": "Numbers as bags of primes", "text": "Let us start with an example of the role of representation in number theory. Consider the following problem:\nProblem 1. Let n be a positive integer. Assume that, for every prime p, if p divides n then p2 also divides n. Prove that n is the product of a square and a cube.\nA standard solution to this problem is to take a set of primes pi such that n = pa11 p a2 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 p ak k . Then we notice that the condition \u201cif p divides n then p\n2 also divides n\u201d means that ai 6= 1, for each ai. Then, we need to find x1, x2, . . . , xk and y1, y2, . . . , yk where\n(px11 p x2 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 p xk n ) 2(py11 p y2 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 p yk n ) 3 = pa11 p a2 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 p ak n\nor simply\n2(x1, x2, . . . , xk) + 3(y1, y2, . . . , yk) = (a1, a2, . . . , ak).\nThus, we only need to prove that for every ai 6= 1 there is a pair xi, yi such that 2xi + 3yi = ai. The proof of this is routine.\nThe kind of reasoning used for this problem is considered standard by mathematicians. However, it is not so simple in current systems for automated theorem proving. The non-standard step is the \u2018translation\u2019 from an expression containing various applications of the exponential function into a simpler form in a linear arithmetic of lists, validated by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.\nThe informal nature of the argument, in the usual mathematical presentation, leaves it open whether the reasoning is best thought as happening in an arithmetic of lists where the elements are the exponents of the primes, or perhaps a theory of bags (multisets) where the elements are prime numbers. The reader might find it very easy to fluidly understand how these representations match with each other and how they are really just different aspects of the same thing. Such ease supports our overall argument and vision: that to automate mathematical reasoning, we require a framework in which data structures are linked robustly by logically valid translations, where the translation from one to another is easily conjured up.\nThe numbers-as-bags-of-primes transformation that links each positive integer to the bag of its prime factors is valid because there are operations on each side (numbers and multisets) that correspond to one another. For example, \u2018divides\u2019 corresponds to \u2018sub(multi)set\u2019, \u2018least common multiple\u2019 corresponds to \u2018union\u2019, \u2018product\u2019 corresponds to \u2018multiset addition\u2019, etc. Furthermore, all the predicates used in the statement of problem 1 have correspondences with wellknown predicates regarding bags of primes. Thus, the problem can be translated as a whole. Other representations may not be very productive, e.g., try thinking about exponentiation in terms of lists of digits.\nTable 1 shows more examples of number theory problems with their corresponding problem about multisets."}, {"heading": "Numbers as sets", "text": "Many numerical problems have combinatorial proofs. Theses are proofs where numbers are interpreted to be cardinalities of sets, and the whole problem can be converted to a problem about sets.\nEnumerative combinatorics studies how sets relate to their cardinalities. As such, its theorems provide the link that allows us to translate numerical problems into finite set-theoretical problems.\nTable 2 shows examples of arithmetic problems with their corresponding finite set theory problems. While the proofs of the numerical versions are not obvious at all (some of which are important results in basic combinatorics), the proofs of their finite set versions can be considered routine."}, {"heading": "Interconnectedness", "text": "We want to stress the importance of having fluidity of representations. For example, we talked about the ease with which we could think that the numbersas-bags-of-primes transformation is actually a transformation of numbers to a theory of lists, where elements of the list are the exponents of the ordered prime factors. Inspired by this, we have mechanised many other simple transformations, but whose composition allows us to translate fluently from one representation to another. Our global vision of transformations useful in discrete mathematics, which we have mechanised4, is represented in Figure 1. It is worth mentioning that the diagram is not commutative and that it abstracts logical relations (information may be lost, so some paths can only be traversed in one direction).\nIn the next section we show how a notion of transformation that accounts for this kind of correspondence between structures can be applied in formal proofs using Isabelle\u2019s Transfer tool."}, {"heading": "4 On Transformations and the Transfer tool", "text": "In this section we give a brief overview of a very general theory of transformations. We do not claim originality of the essence of this theory. However, we believe that the presentation we give brings clarity to the problem. We explain how Isabelle\u2019s Transfer tool relates to it. Consider the following definitions:\nDefinition 1. A domain is a class of entities and a set of types, where each entity of the domain corresponds to exactly one type.\n4 These can be found in http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1052074/AutoTransfer/. They are updated regularly.\nDefinition 2. A transformation from a domain X to a domain Y is a collection R where every R \u2208 R is a relation R : X \u2192 Y \u2192 B between a type X of domain X and a type Y of domain Y .5\nThis relational notion of a transformation makes it possible to account for partial and multivalued mappings in a logic like Isabelle\u2019s HOL.\nWe consider a structure to be the class conformed by all the entities of the closure of a domain under a set of type constructors. In this work, we focus on structures containing type B, generated with the function type constructor \u2192, because the basis of a higher order logic can be fully expressed under such a structure. Then, if our domain has entities of types A and B, its structure under \u2192 has all the entities of types A \u2192 B, A \u2192 B \u2192 A, etc.\nPreservation of structure is captured with the use of structural relators, which can be thought of as rules for extending relations (transformations) to the structures of their domains. In particular, given that our work is based on Isabelle/HOL and on the Transfer package, we focus on one relator.\nDefinition 3. The standard functional extension of two relations RA : A \u2192 A\u2032 \u2192 B and RB : B \u2192 B\u2032 \u2192 B (written RA Z\u21d2 RB) is a relation that relates two functions f : A \u2192 B and f \u2032 : A\u2032 \u2192 B\u2032 whenever they satisfy the following property:\n\u2200 a : A. \u2200 a\u2032 : A\u2032. [RA a a \u2032 \u2212\u2192 RB (f a) (f \u2032 a\u2032)]\nWe call the operator Z\u21d2 the standard function relator. Intuitively, (RA Z\u21d2 RB) f g means that f and g send arguments related by RA to values related by RB. This relator allows us to express how functions (and by extension relations) map to each other in a way that the structure of the domain is preserved.\nFor the numbers-as-bags-of-primes transformation, consider relation F : N \u2192 N multiset \u2192 B, that relates every positive integer with the multiset of its prime factors.\n5 B stands for type of booleans.\nExample 1. Let \u2217 : N \u2192 N \u2192 N be the usual multiplication and \u228e : N multiset \u2192 N multiset \u2192 N multiset the \u2018addition\u2019 of multisets (in which the multiplicities are added per element). Then we have (F Z\u21d2 (F Z\u21d2 F)) \u2217 \u228e (also written (F Z\u21d2 F Z\u21d2 F) \u2217 \u228e). Note that, by expanding the definition of Z\u21d2 in (F Z\u21d2 (F Z\u21d2 F)) \u2217 \u228e we get\n\u2200n1. \u2200N1. F n1N1 \u2212\u2192 (\u2200n2. \u2200N2. F n2 N2 \u2212\u2192 F (n1 \u2217 n2) (N1 \u228eN2))\nwhich is equivalent to\n\u2200n1, n2. \u2200N1, N2. (F n1 N1 \u2227 F n2 N2) \u2212\u2192 F (n1 \u2217 n2) (N1 \u228eN2)\nThis demonstrates how nesting the operator Z\u21d2 preserves its intuitive definition: \u2018related arguments map to related values\u2019. In this particular case, this is true due to the law of exponents papb = pa+b.\nFurthermore, the matching of relations can also be expressed with the help of Z\u21d2, using a boolean relation, as demonstrated by the example below with equivalence (boolean equality) eq : B \u2192 B \u2192 B.\nExample 2. Let div : N \u2192 N \u2192 B be the relation such that div nm whenever n divides m (also written n|m), and \u2286: N multiset \u2192 N multiset \u2192 B the relation such that a \u2286 b whenever the multiplicity of each element of a is lesser or equal to its multiplicity in b. Then, we have (F Z\u21d2 F Z\u21d2 eq) div \u2286, because n divides m if and only if every prime is contained at least as many times in the multiset-factorisation of m as it is in n.\nLogical matches (preservation of truth values) can also be expressed across structures, e.g., (eq Z\u21d2 eq Z\u21d2 eq) imp imp represents that implication imp preserves truth if its arguments are replaced by equivalent ones. Other interesting logical matches can be expressed as well.\nThe general notion of transformation above tells us how theories will relate to one another. Isabelle\u2019s Transfer method is an algorithm for transforming a sentence using knowledge about one of these transformations. The simple standard function relator is at the basis of the method. We give a short introduction next."}, {"heading": "4.1 Transforming sentences with the Transfer tool", "text": "When trying to prove a sentence \u03b2 we want to find another sentence \u03b1 such that \u03b1 \u2212\u2192 \u03b2, along with a proof for \u03b1. In particular, if \u03b2 talks about a domain B and we know a structural transformation from a domain A to B, we might be able to find an \u03b1 about A, such that \u03b1 \u2212\u2192 \u03b2.\nIsabelle\u2019s Transfer tool provides a method for finding such \u03b1. The user has to provide theorems of the forms R1 a b or (R1 Z\u21d2 R2) f g (and their proofs), i.e., instances of a structural transformation, and the tactics transfer and transfer\u2032 will try to automatically infer a sentence \u03b1 such that \u03b1 \u2190\u2192 \u03b2 (in the case of transfer), or a weaker one such that \u03b1 \u2212\u2192 \u03b2 (in the case of transfer\u2032).\nRecall that the intuitive interpretation of (R1 Z\u21d2 R2) f g is \u2018arguments related by R1 are mapped to values related by R2 by f and g. Thus, the first step of the transfer method is to search for a theorem of the structural transformation with the shape (R1 Z\u21d2 eq) p q in the case of transfer and (R1 Z\u21d2 imp) p q in the case of transfer\u2032, where q is the property wrapping the sentence we want to prove. Finding it would imply that we can replace q by p provided that we can find that their arguments are related by R1. Thus, the method searches recursively for rules in the structural transformation to prove this. The algorithm is analogous to type inference. It is based on the following derivation rules:\nA \u2217 C \u22a2 (R1 Z\u21d2 R2) f g A \u2217C \u22a2 R1 x y\nelim A \u2217\nC \u22a2 R2 (f x) (g y)\nA \u2217 C , R1 x y \u22a2 R2 (f x) (g y)\nintro A \u2217\nC \u22a2 (R1 Z\u21d2 R2) (\u03bbx. f x) (\u03bby. g y)\nwhere A \u2217 C represents knowledge about the structural transformation. Practically, the user provides knowledge specific to this transformation (a set of theorems called transfer rules), and the algorithm includes in the search other general transfer rules such as (eq Z\u21d2 eq Z\u21d2 eq) imp imp. For more details of the actual implementation of the algorithm see [6]."}, {"heading": "5 Mechanising transformations in Isabelle\u2019s HOL", "text": "In Section 3 we presented some problems in discrete mathematics which involve structural transformation.

The transfer tool allows us to use the transformations in proofs.\nIn this section we present a couple of examples from a larger catalogue of the transformations we have mechanised in Isabelle. The transformations we have formalised, as suggested in Figure 1, are the following:\n1. numbers-as-bags-of-primes, where each natural number is related to the multiset of its prime factorisation. 2. numbers-as-sets, where numbers are related to sets by the cardinality function. 3. sets-as-B-functions, where sets are seen as boolean-valued functions. 4. multisets-as-N-functions, where multisets are seen as natural-valued func-\ntions6. 5. sets-as-lists, where sets are related to lists of their elements. 6. bits-from-integers, where type bit is created as an abstract type from the\nintegers.\n6 This one is actually by construction using typedef and the Lifting package, which automatically declares transfer rules from definitions lifted by the user from an old type to the newly declared type.\n7. bits-as-booleans, where bits are matched to booleans. 8. Q-automorphisms, where rational numbers are stretched and contracted,\nparametric on a factor. 9. zero-or-some, where natural 0 is related to bit 0 and positive natural num-\nbers are related to bit 1. 10. multisets-as-lists, where multisets are related to lists of their elements. 11. set-to-multiset, where the functional representations of multisets and sets\nare related (this one, we get it for free from the zero-or-some transformation). 12. naturals-as-integers, where naturals are matched to integers (this one was\nbuilt by the developers of the transfer package, not us). 13. integers-as-rationals, where integers are matched to rational numbers.\nNotice that composition of transformations leads to other natural transformations, like the simple relation between sets and multisets.7\nEvery transformation starts with a declaration and proof of transfer rules, which are sentences satisfied by the structural transformation."}, {"heading": "5.1 Numbers as bags of primes", "text": "The relation at the centre of this transformation is F : N \u2192 N multiset \u2192 B, which relates every positive number to the multiset of its prime factors.

Some of them are defined only for use of the transformation, like disjU and plus (the predicative version of disjoint union of sets and addition of natural numbers, respectively), or bounded quantifiers. These are necessary for the transfer method to find matches, but theorems will not generally be stated in such terms. Our tactic normalises the language of the goal to suit the specific transformation that is going to be applied."}, {"heading": "6.2 Reversing transformations", "text": "We have implemented a tool to automatically reverse transformations. Let us explain this.\nIf we want to transform a sentence p a to an equivalent one, the Transfer method will search for transfer rules (R Z\u21d2 eq) q p and R b a for some R, q and b. If found, it will transform the sentence to the equivalent one q b. The fact that the sentences are equivalent means that if we had started with q b as a goal, it would have been valid to transform it to p a. This means that, in theory, the same transfer rules can be used to do inference in one direction or the other, at least when the rules are regarding equivalence. The Transfer method does not do so: if one wants to use a transformation in both directions one has to define two distinct transformations, i.e., two distinct sets of transfer rules (in our example above one needs transfer rules (R\u2032 Z\u21d2 eq) p q and R\u2032 a b, where R\u2032 is the reverse of R). A transfer rule always has a \u2018reverse\u2019 version (although only equivalent ones retain full information), so we should be able to get these automatically. We have built a conversion tool that, given a set of transfer rules, will generate all their reverse rules (in a logically valid way, i.e., the reverse version is always equivalent to the original).\nOur program uses the following rewrite rules:\nRa b \u21d2 (swapR) b a\nswap (R1 Z\u21d2 R2) \u21d2 (swapR1 Z\u21d2 swapR2)\nwhere swap simply swaps the place of the arguments of a function. It is easy to see that these rules are valid. Moreover, swapR equals R when R is symmetric, which means that in some relations we can drop the swap function. Thus, our program drops swap from eq and turns swap imp and swap revimp into revimp and imp, respectively.\nBy reversing every transformation we can traverse every path in Figure 1 in any direction (which does not mean that every sentence has a transformation to an equivalent one)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Search between representations", "text": "Our tactic searches the space of representations by applying each transformation, then reasoning within the theory where it arrived, and, if there are still open subgoals it will repeat the process iteratively.\nRecall that transformations are relational. As such, the process is nondeterministic for each transformation, so there will be many branches per transformation. Apart from being non-deterministic, the transfer method will allow transformations of a sentence where some matches are left open, i.e., in the place of some constant we get a schematic variable that the user can instantiate manually, and prove their validity with the new instantiation. This can be handy, but our tactic favours branches with the lowest number of open subgoals, thus favouring complete matches; e.g., matches that will not leave any proof obligations open.\nWe have also noticed that the order in which the transformations are searched is crucial and have set an ad hoc order that favours the transformations we consider more interesting. Heuristics deserve further work, but that remains as a task for the future.\nDiscarding false representations. Recall that our transformations do not necessarily yield equivalent sentences when applying the transfer algorithm (unless we restrict it to do so). Actually, the numbers-as-sets transformation can only be applied in useful ways if we allow the reduction of the goal to a strictly stronger subgoal (because, e.g., A \u2286 B implies that |A| \u2264 |B|, but not the other way around, meaning that we can prove |A| \u2264 |B| by showing first A \u2286 B, but we cannot prove A \u2286 B by showing |A| \u2264 |B|). This can lead to false subgoals. Thus, our tactic calls the counterexample checker nitpick [1] and discards branches where a counterexample is found for one of its goals."}, {"heading": "6.4 Overview", "text": "In a single step in the search, our tactic does the following:\n1. Normalise to transformation-specific language. 2. Apply transformation. 3. If working with a transformation that generates a stronger subgoal, search\nfor counterexamples and discard if they are found. 4. Apply auto tactic to transformed sentence.\nThe tactic can be applied recursively to search for a transformation to a domain more than one step away. When searching, the obvious stop condition is that the theorem has been proved, although there can be other good reasons to stop in a domain to allow the user to reason interactively.\nEach of the 4 steps mentioned can have plenty of branches, so there is search involved. Branches with the least number subgoals are favoured, and the order in which the transformations are applied matters, but there are no clever heuristics involved.\nEven though our observations about the trace of the search have led us to the current design and implementation of the tactic, the design is not yet complete and its implementation (although functional) is very much subject to change. There are still open questions regarding what search strategies, stop conditions, and reasoning tactics (between transformations) are the best, because these are subject to what evaluation criterion we should use. In Section 8 we discuss why this is problematic and how we are confronting it."}, {"heading": "7 Related Work", "text": "Although representation is widely recognised as a crucial aspect of reasoning, to our knowledge there has been no attempt to incorporate the automatic search of representation into reasoning tools."}, {"heading": "Institutions and HETS", "text": "The concept of Institution was introduced to as a general notion of logical system [5]. The Heterogeneous Tool Set (HETS) [8] was developed mainly to manage and integrate heterogeneous specifications. Based on the theory of Institutions, it links various logics, including Isabelle\u2019s HOL and FOL, and provides a way of translating between them. The uses of HETS have been to bring together various aspects of complex systems where different programming languages and reasoning tools are used for different parts of the system. We do not know of any uses of HETS where heterogeneity is taken advantage of as a means of finding proofs in one representation where other representations fail."}, {"heading": "Little Theories and IMPS", "text": "\u201cLittle Theories\u201d is the notion that reasoning is best done when it is modular [3]. IMPS is a an interactive proof system implemented based on the principles of Little Theories [4].

Thus, it concerns different levels of abstraction of a theory, and not directly representation of the entities of the theory."}, {"heading": "Uses of the Transfer package", "text": "The use of the Transfer package has changed how new quotient types and subtypes are defined. This is what the Lifting package does [6]. As part of the lifting package, there is a way of automatically transferring definitions from an old type to a new type (e.g., multisets are defined as an abstract type from the type of N-valued functions).\nThe Lifting package has been the main application of the Transfer package, although the generality of their approach is acknowledged by the developers. Embodying this generality, they have built an Isabelle theory of transference from integers to natural numbers, very much in the spirit of the various transformations we have built ourselves."}, {"heading": "8 Evaluation, Future Work and Conclusion", "text": "The main contributions presented in this paper are:\n\u2013 We mechanised various useful transformations observed in proofs of discrete mathematics. \u2013 We have proved example theorems using these transformations. \u2013 We have identified some requirements for search over the space of represen-\ntations, and implemented both a tool (for reversing transformations) and a tactic fulfilling the requirements.\nOur tactic has yet to be evaluated properly. Below we examine some of the difficulties associated with this task.\nWhat makes one proof better than another? There is no definite answer for this question. Simple measures, such as length, are important, but unsatisfactory as a whole. At the very least, we can agree that some proof is better than no proof. Thus, the simplest scenario for evaluation would be that in which our tactic that reasons within many representations finds proofs which cannot be found otherwise. Unfortunately, the current state of automatic theorem provers does not seem to be conducive to this. All the examples in which we have tested our techniques belong to either of the following classes:\n1. They are so simple that they can be proved automatically8 without the need of a transformation. 2. They are too complicated and require an intervention from the user to complete the proof, even after automatically applying a transformation.9\nThus, the proof-or-no-proof criterion is not applicable . Then, it is necessary to work on close analysis of interactive proofs with transformations and without them.\nA venture for future research is the potential application of this framework for the transformation of geometric problems into algebraic representations, e.g., Gro\u0308bner bases [2], where there has been plenty of success in automated reasoning, or into SAT/SMT, which also have been an area of success in automation.10\nInterestingly, we have an example (Pascal\u2019s theorem) that belongs to the class of problems where Isabelle\u2019s automatic tactics can find a proof, but where its proof using a transformation deserves attention. It is provable automatically (from the definition of the choose operator included in Isabelle\u2019s combinatorics library by its developers), but can be transformed using the numbers-as-sets transformations and proved only interactively there. Arguably, a combinatorial proof could be highly valued by mathematicians (or a scientist who analyses\n8 using Isabelle tactics like auto 9 The examples of this second (more interesting) class have been selected from either maths textbooks for undergraduate students, or from training material for contests such as the Mathematical Olympiads. 10 We thank the anonymous referees of this paper for suggested these possibilities. They remain as future work.\nproofs), making this an example where the interactive proof deserves equal, or even more, attention than the automatic proof.\nFurthermore, even in the case in which we had automatic proofs using the usual tactics (like Pascal\u2019s theorem, mentioned above), we have to consider that these tactics depend on background knowledge (in our case, this amounts to Isabelle\u2019s libraries, which have been vastly populated by users). This raises the question: are there ways in which we can measure success independently of the background theories? We think that this is partially achievable by building simpler theories, with some equal level of measurable simplicity, and testing tactics that incorporate representational change there. Even if impractical by itself, this might bring some scientific insight that might lead to better reasoning tactics and theorem provers in the future."}], "references": [{"title": "Nitpick: A counterexample generator for higher-order logic based on a relational model finder", "author": ["Jasmin Christian Blanchette", "Tobias Nipkow"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Gr\u00f6bner bases and applications, volume 251", "author": ["Bruno Buchberger", "Franz Winkler"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1998}, {"title": "IMPS} : an Interactive Mathematical Proof System", "author": ["William M Farmer", "Joshua D Guttman", "F Javier Thayer"], "venue": "Journal of Automated Reasoning,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 1993}, {"title": "Institutions: Abstract model theory for specification and programming", "author": ["Joseph A Goguen", "Rod M Burstall"], "venue": "Journal of the ACM (JACM),", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 1992}, {"title": "Kun\u010dar.
