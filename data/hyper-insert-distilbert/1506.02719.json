As suggested by the name, this mechanism generalizes the standard second-price auction of Vickrey (1961) to multiple items. In the case of sponsored search advertisement, these items correspond to ad slots which have been ranked by their position. Given this ranking, the GSP auction works as follows: first, each advertiser places a bid; next, the seller, based on the bids placed, assigns a score to each bidder. The highest scored advertiser is assigned to the slot in the best position, that is, the one with the highest likelihood of being clicked on. The second highest score obtains the second best item and so on, until all slots have been allocated or all advertisers have been assigned to a slot. As with second-price auctions, the bidder\u2019s payment is independent of his bid. Instead, it depends\nsolely on the bid of the advertiser assigned to the position below.\nIn spite of its similarity with second-price auctions, the GSP auction is not an incentive-compatible mechanism, that is, bidders have an incentive to lie about their valuations. This is in stark contrast with second-price auctions where truth revealing is in fact a dominant strategy. It is for this reason that predicting the behavior of bidders in a GSP auction is challenging. This is further worsened by the fact that these auctions are repeated multiple times a day. The study of all possible equilibria of this repeated game is at the very least difficult. While incentive compatible generalizations of the second-price auction exist, namely the Vickrey-Clark-Gloves (VCG) mechanism, the simplicity of the payment rule for GSP auctions as well as the large revenue generated by them has made the adoption of VCG mechanisms unlikely.\nSince its introduction by Google, GSP auctions have generated billions of dollars across different online advertisement companies. It is therefore not surprising that it has become a topic of great interest for diverse fields such as Economics, Algorithmic Game Theory and more recently Machine Learning.\nThe first analysis of GSP auctions was carried out independently by Edelman et al. (2005) and Varian (2007). Both publications considered a full information scenario, that is one where the advertisers\u2019 valuations are publicly known. This assumption is weakly supported by the fact that repeated interactions allow advertisers to infer their adversaries\u2019 valuations. Varian (2007) studied the so-called Symmetric Nash Equilibria (SNE) which is a subset of the Nash equilibria with several favorable properties. In particular, Varian showed that any SNE induces an efficient allocation, that is an allocation where the highest positions are assigned to advertisers with high values. Furthermore, the revenue earned by the seller when advertisers play an SNE is always at least as much as the one obtained by VCG. The authors also presented some empirical results showing that some bidders indeed play by using an SNE. However, no theoretical justification can be given for the choice of\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n02 71\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 8\nJ un\n2 01\nthis subset of equilibria (Bo\u0308rgers et al., 2013; Edelman and Schwarz, 2010). A finer analysis of the full information scenario was given by Lucier et al. (2012). The authors proved that, excluding the payment of the highest bidder, the revenue achieved at any Nash equilibrium is at least one half that of the VCG auction.\nSince the assumption of full information can be unrealistic, a more modern line of research has instead considered a Bayesian scenario for this auction. In a Bayesian setting, it is assumed that advertisers\u2019 valuations are i.i.d. samples drawn from a common distribution. Gomes and Sweeney (2014) characterized all symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibria and showed that any symmetric equilibrium must be efficient. This work was later extended by Sun et al. (2014) to account for the quality score of each advertiser. The main contribution of this work was the design of an algorithm for the crucial problem of revenue optimization for the GSP auction. Lahaie and Pennock (2007) studied different squashing ranking rules for advertisers commonly used in practice and showed that none of these rules are necessarily optimal in equilibrium. This work is complemented by the simulation analysis of Vorobeychik (2009) who quantified the distance from equilibrium of bidding truthfully. Lucier et al. (2012) showed that the GSP auction with an optimal reserve price achieves at least 1/6 of the optimal revenue (of any auction) in a Bayesian equilibrium. More recently, Thompson and Leyton-Brown (2013) compared different allocation rules and showed that an anchoring allocation rule is optimal when valuations are sampled i.i.d. from a uniform distribution. With the exception of Sun et al. (2014), none of these authors have proposed an algorithm for revenue optimization using historical data.\nZhu et al. (2009) introduced a ranking algorithm to learn an optimal allocation rule. The proposed ranking is a convex combination of a quality score based on the features of the advertisement as well as a revenue score which depends on the value of the bids. This work was later extended in (He et al., 2014) where, in addition to the ranking function, a behavioral model of the advertisers is learned by the authors.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a learning formulation of the problem of selecting reserve prices in a GSP auction. In Section 3, we discuss previous work related to this problem. Next, we present and analyze two learning algorithms for this problem in Section 4, one based on density estimation extending to this setting an algorithm of Guerre et al. (2000), and a novel discriminative algorithm taking into account the loss function and benefiting from favorable learning guarantees. Section 5 provides a convergence analysis of the empirical equilibrium bidding function to the true equilibrium bidding function in a GSP. On its own, this result is of great interest as it justifies the common assumption of buyers playing a symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium. Finally, in\nSection 6, we report the results of experiments comparing our algorithms and demonstrating in particular the benefits of the second algorithm."}, {"heading": "2 MODEL", "text": "For the most part, we will use the model defined by Sun et al. (2014) for GSP auctions with incomplete information. We consider N bidders competing for S slots with N \u2265 S. Let vi \u2208 [0, 1] and bi \u2208 [0, 1] denote the per-click valuation of bidder i and his bid respectively. Let the position factor cs \u2208 [0, 1] represent the probability of a user noticing an ad in position s and let ei \u2208 [0, 1] denote the expected click-through rate of advertiser i. That is ei is the probability of ad i being clicked on given that it was noticed by the user. We will adopt the common assumption that cs > cs+1 (Gomes and Sweeney, 2014; Lahaie and Pennock, 2007; Sun et al., 2014; Thompson and Leyton-Brown, 2013). Define the score of bidder i to be si = eivi. Following Sun et al. (2014), we assume that si is an i.i.d. realization of a random variable with distribution F and density function f . Finally, we assume that advertisers bid in an efficient symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium. This is motivated by the fact that even though advertisers may not infer what the valuation of their adversaries is from repeated interactions, they can certainly estimate the distribution F .\nDefine \u03c0 : s 7\u2192 \u03c0(s) as the function mapping slots to advertisers, i.e. \u03c0(s) = i if advertiser i is allocated to position s. For a vector x = (x1, . . . , xN ) \u2208 RN , we use the notation x(s) := x\u03c0(s). Finally, denote by ri the reserve price for advertiser i. An advertiser may participate in the auction only if bi \u2265 ri. In this paper we present an analysis of the two most common ranking rules (Qin et al., 2014):\n1. Rank-by-bid. Advertisers who bid above their reserve price are ranked in descending order of their bids and the payment of advertiser \u03c0(s) is equal to max(r(s), b(s+1)).\n2. Rank-by-revenue. Each advertiser is assigned a quality score qi := qi(bi) = eibi1bi\u2265ri and the ranking is done by sorting these scores in descending order. The payment of advertiser \u03c0(s) is given by max ( r(s), q (s+1)\ne(s)\n) .\nIn both setups, only advertisers bidding above their reserve price are considered. Notice that rank-by-bid is a particular case of rank-by-revenue where all quality scores are equal to 1. Given a vector of reserve prices r and a bid vector b, we define the revenue function to be\nRev(r,b)\n= S\u2211 s=1 cs (q(s+1) e(s) 1q(s+1)\u2265e(s)r(s)+r (s)1q(s+1)<e(s)r(s)\u2264q(s) )\nUsing the notation of Mohri and Medina (2014), we define the loss function\nL(r,b) = \u2212Rev(r,b).\nGiven an i.i.d. sample S = (b1, . . . ,bn) of realizations of an auction, our objective will be to find a reserve price vector r\u2217 that maximizes the expected revenue. Equivalently, r\u2217 should be a solution of the following optimization problem:\nmin r\u2208[0,1]N\nEb[L(r,b)]. (1)"}, {"heading": "3 PREVIOUS WORK", "text": "It has been shown, both theoretically and empirically, that reserve prices can increase the revenue of an auction (Myerson, 1981; Ostrovsky and Schwarz, 2011). The choice of an appropriate reserve price therefore becomes crucial. If it is chosen too low, the seller might lose some revenue. On the other hand, if it is set too high, then the advertisers may not wish to bid above that value and the seller will not obtain any revenue from the auction.\nMohri and Medina (2014), Pardoe et al. (2005), and CesaBianchi et al. (2013) have given learning algorithms that estimate the optimal reserve price for a second-price auction in different information scenarios. The scenario we consider is most closely related to that of Mohri and Medina (2014). An extension of this work to the GSP auction, however, is not straightforward. Indeed, as we will show later, the optimal reserve price vector depends on the distribution of the advertisers\u2019 valuation. In a second-price auction, these valuations are observed since the corresponding mechanism is an incentive-compatible. This does not hold for GSP auctions. Moreover, for second-price auctions, only one reserve price had to be estimated. In contrast, our model requires the estimation of up to N parameters with intricate dependencies between them.\nThe problem of estimating valuations from observed bids in a non-incentive compatible mechanism has been previously analyzed. Guerre et al. (2000) described a way of estimating valuations from observed bids in a first-price auction. We will show that this method can be extended to the GSP auction. The rate of convergence of this algorithm, however, in general will be worse than the standard learning rate of O ( 1\u221a n ) .\nSun et al. (2014) showed that, for advertisers playing an efficient equilibrium, the optimal reserve price is given by ri =\nr ei where r satisfies\nr = 1\u2212 F (r) f(r) .\nThe authors suggest learning r via a maximum likelihood technique over some parametric family to estimate f and\nF , and to use these estimates in the above expression. There are two main drawbacks for this algorithm. The first is a standard problem of parametric statistics: there are no guarantees on the convergence of their estimation procedure when the density function f is not part of the parametric family considered. While this problem can be addressed by the use of a non-parametric estimation algorithm such as kernel density estimation, the fact remains that the function f is the density for the unobservable scores si and therefore cannot be properly estimated. The solution proposed by the authors assumes that the bids in fact form a perfect SNE and so advertisers\u2019 valuations can be recovered using the process described by Varian (2007). There is however no justification for this assumption and, in fact, we show in Section 6 that bids played in a Bayes-Nash equilibrium do not in general form a SNE."}, {"heading": "4 LEARNING ALGORITHMS", "text": "Here, we present and analyze two algorithms for learning the optimal reserve price for a GSP auction when advertisers play a symmetric equilibrium."}, {"heading": "4.1 DENSITY ESTIMATION ALGORITHM", "text": "First, we derive an extension of the algorithm of Guerre et al. (2000) to GSP auctions. To do so, we first derive a formula for the bidding strategy at equilibrium. Let zs(v) denote the probability of winning position s given that the advertiser\u2019s valuation is v. It is not hard to verify that\nzs(v) = ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) (1\u2212 F (v))s\u22121F p(v),\nwhere p = N \u2212 s. Indeed, in an efficient equilibrium, the bidder with the s-th highest valuation must be assigned to the s-th highest position. Therefore an advertiser with valuation v is assigned to position s if and only if s\u22121 bidders have a higher valuation and p have a lower valuation.\nFor a rank-by-bid auction, Gomes and Sweeney (2014) showed the following results.\nTheorem 1 (Gomes and Sweeney (2014)). A GSP auction has a unique efficient symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium with bidding strategy \u03b2 if and only if \u03b2 is strictly increasing and satisfies the following integral equation: S\u2211 s=1 cs \u222b v 0 dzs(t) dt tdt (2)\n= S\u2211 s=1 cs ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) (1\u2212 F (v))s\u22121 \u222b v 0 \u03b2(t)pF p\u22121(t)f(t)dt.\nFurthermore, the optimal reserve price r\u2217 satisfies\nr\u2217 = 1\u2212 F (r\u2217) f(r\u2217) . (3)\nThe authors show that, if the click probabilities cs are sufficiently diverse, then, \u03b2 is guaranteed to be strictly increasing. When ranking is done by revenue, Sun et al. (2014) gave the following theorem.\nTheorem 2 (Sun et al. (2014)). Let \u03b2 be defined by the previous theorem. If advertisers bid in a Bayes-Nash equilibrium then bi =\n\u03b2(vi) ei . Moreover, the optimal reserve price vector r\u2217 is given by r\u2217i = r ei where r satisfies equation (3).\nWe are now able to present the foundation of our first algorithm. Instead of assuming that the bids constitute an SNE as in (Sun et al., 2014), we follow the ideas of Guerre et al. (2000) and infer the scores si only from observables bi. Our result is presented for the rank-by-bid GSP auction but an extension to the rank-by-revenue mechanism is trivial.\nLemma 1. Let v1, . . . , vn be an i.i.d. sample of valuations from distribution F and let bi = \u03b2(vi) be the bid played at equilibrium. Then the random variables bi are i.i.d. with distribution G(b) = F (\u03b2\u22121(b)) and density g(b) = f(\u03b2\n\u22121(b)) \u03b2\u2032(\u03b2\u22121(b)) . Furthermore,\nvi = \u03b2 \u22121(bi) (4)\n=\n\u2211S s=1 cs ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) (1\u2212G(bi))s\u22121bipG(bi)p\u22121g(bi)\u2211S s=1 cs ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) dz db (bi)\n\u2212 \u2211S s=1cs(s\u22121)(1\u2212G(bi))s\u22122g(bi) \u222b bi 0 pG(u)p\u22121ug(u)du\u2211S\ns=1 cs ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) dz db (bi)\n,\nwhere zs(b) := zs(\u03b2\u22121(b)) and is given by ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) (1 \u2212 G(b))s\u22121G(b)p\u22121.\nProof. By definition, bi = \u03b2(vi) is a function of only vi. Since \u03b2 does not depend on the other samples either, it follows that (bi)Ni=1 must be an i.i.d. sample. Using the fact that \u03b2 is a strictly increasing function we also have G(b) = P (bi \u2264 b) = P (vi \u2264 \u03b2\u22121(b)) = F (\u03b2\u22121(b)) and a simple application of the chain rule gives us the expression for the density g(b). To prove the second statement observe that by the change of variable v = \u03b2\u22121(b), the right-hand side of (2) is equal to\nS\u2211 s=1 ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) (1\u2212G(b))s\u22121 \u222b \u03b2\u22121(b) 0 p\u03b2(t)F p\u22121(t)f(t)dt\n= S\u2211 s=1 ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) (1\u2212G(b))s\u22121 \u222b b 0 puG(u)p\u22121(u)g(u)du.\nThe last equality follows by the change of variable t = \u03b2(u) and from the fact that g(b) = f(\u03b2\n\u22121(b)) \u03b2\u2032(\u03b2\u22121(b)) . The same\nchange of variables applied to the left-hand side of (2)\nyields the following integral equation: S\u2211 s=1 ( N\u22121 s\u22121 )\u222b b 0 \u03b2\u22121(u) dz du (u)du\n= S\u2211 s=1 ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) (1\u2212G(b))s\u22121 \u222b b 0 upG(u)p\u22121(u)g(u)du.\nTaking the derivative with respect to b of both sides of this equation and rearranging terms lead to the desired expression.\nThe previous Lemma shows that we can recover the valuation of an advertiser from its bid. We therefore propose the following algorithm for estimating the value of r.\n1. Use the sample S to estimate G and g. 2. Plug this estimates in (4) to obtain approximate sam-\nples from the distribution F . 3. Use the approximate samples to find estimates f\u0302 and F\u0302 of the valuations density and cumulative distribution functions respectively.\n4. Use F\u0302 and f\u0302 to estimate r.\nIn order to avoid the use of parametric methods, a kernel density estimation algorithm can be used to estimate g and f . While this algorithm addresses both drawbacks of the algorithm proposed by Sun et al. (2014), it can be shown (Guerre et al., 2000)[Theorem 2] that if f isR times continuously differentiable, then, after seeing n samples, \u2016f \u2212 f\u0302\u2016\u221e is in \u2126 ( 1\nnR/(2R+3)\n) independently of the algo-\nrithm used to estimate f . In particular, note that for R = 1 the rate is in \u2126\n( 1\nn1/4\n) . This unfavorable rate of conver-\ngence can be attributed to the fact that a two-step estimation algorithm is being used (estimation of g and f ). But, even with access to bidder valuations, the rate can only be improved to \u2126 ( 1\nnR/(2R+1)\n) (Guerre et al., 2000). Furthermore,\na small error in the estimation of f affects the denominator of the equation defining r and can result in a large error on the estimate of r."}, {"heading": "4.2 DISCRIMINATIVE ALGORITHM", "text": "In view of the problems associated with density estimation, we propose to use empirical risk minimization to find an approximation to the optimal reserve price. In particular, we are interested in solving the following optimization problem:\nmin r\u2208[0,1]N n\u2211 i=1 L(r,bi). (5)\nWe first show that, when bidders play in equilibrium, the optimization problem (1) can be considerably simplified. Proposition 1. If advertisers play a symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium then\nmin r\u2208[0,1]N Eb[L(r,b)] = min r\u2208[0,1] Eb[L\u0303(r,b)],\nwhere q\u0303i := q\u0303i(bi) = eibi and L\u0303(r,b) = \u2212 S\u2211 s=1 cs e(s) ( q\u0303(s+1)1q\u0303(s+1)\u2265r+r1q\u0303(s+1)<r\u2264q\u0303(s) ) .\nProof. Since advertisers play a symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium, the optimal reserve price vector r\u2217 is of the form r\u2217i = r ei\n. Therefore, letting D = {r|ri = r ei , r \u2208 [0, 1]} we have minr\u2208[0,1]N Eb[L(r,b)] = minr\u2208D Eb[L(r,b)]. Furthermore, when restricted to D, the objective function L is given by\n\u2212 S\u2211 s=1 cs e(s) ( q(s+1)1q(s+1)\u2265r + r1q(s+1)<r\u2264q(s) ) .\nThus, we are left with showing that replacing q(s) with q\u0303(s) in this expression does not affect its value. Let r \u2265 0, since qi = q\u0303i1q\u0303i\u2265r, in general the equality q\n(s) = q\u0303(s) does not hold. Nevertheless, if s0 denotes the largest index less than or equal to S satisfying q(s0) > 0, then q\u0303(s) \u2265 r for all s \u2264 s0 and q(s) = q\u0303(s). On the other hand, for S \u2265 s > s0, 1q(s)\u2265r = 1q\u0303(s)\u2265r = 0. Thus, S\u2211 s=1 cs e(s) ( q(s+1)1q(s+1)\u2265r + r1q(s+1)<r\u2264q(s)\n) =\ns0\u2211 s=1 cs e(s) ( q(s+1)1q(s+1)\u2265r + r1q(s+1)<r\u2264q(s) ) =\ns0\u2211 s=1 cs e(s) ( q\u0303(s+1)1q\u0303(s+1)\u2265r + r1q\u0303(s+1)<r\u2264q\u0303(s) ) = \u2212L\u0303(r,b),\nwhich completes the proof.\nIn view of this proposition, we can replace the challenging problem of solving an optimization problem in RN with solving the following simpler empirical risk minimization problem\nmin r\u2208[0,1] n\u2211 i=1 L\u0303(r,bi) = min r\u2208[0,1] n\u2211 i=1 S\u2211 s=1 Ls,i(r, q\u0303 (s), q\u0303(s+1)),\n(6)\nAlgorithm 1 Minimization algorithm\nRequire: Scores (q\u0303(s)i ), 1 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 s \u2264 S. 1: Define (p(1)is , p (2) is ) = (q\u0303 (s) i , q\u0303 (s+1) i ); m = nS;\n2: N := \u22c3n i=1 \u22c3S s=1{p (1) is , p (2) is }; 3: (n1, ..., n2m) = Sort(N ); 4: Set di := (d1, d2) = 0 5: Set d1 = \u2212 \u2211n i=1 \u2211S s=1 cs ei p (2) is ; 6: Set r\u2217 = \u22121 and L\u2217 =\u221e 7: for j = 2, . . . , 2m do 8: if nj\u22121 = p (2) is then 9: d1 = d1 + cs ei p (2) is ; d2 = d2 \u2212 cs ei ;\n10: else if nj\u22121 = p (1) is then 11: d2 = d2 + cs es 12: end if 13: L = d1 \u2212 njd2; 14: if L < L\u2217 then 15: L\u2217 = L; r\u2217 = nj ; 16: end if 17: end for 18: return r\u2217;\nwhere Ls,i(r, q\u0303(s)), q\u0303(s+1)) := \u2212 cse(s) (q\u0303 (s+1) i 1q\u0303(s+1)i \u2265r \u2212 r1\nq\u0303 (s+1) i <r\u2264q\u0303 (s) i ). In order to efficiently minimize this highly non-convex function, we draw upon the work of Mohri and Medina (2014) on minimization of sums of vfunctions.\nDefinition 1. A function V : R3 \u2192 R is a v-function if it admits the following form:\nV (r, q1, q2) =\u2212a(1)1r\u2264q2\u2212a(2)r1q2<r\u2264q1+ [ r \u03b7 \u2212a(3) ] 1q1<r<(1+\u03b7)q1 ,\nwith 0 \u2264 a(1), a(2), a(3), \u03b7 \u2264 \u221e constants satisfying a(1) = a(2)q2, \u2212a(2)q11\u03b7>0 = ( 1 \u03b7 q1 \u2212 a (3) ) 1\u03b7>0. Under the convention that 0 \u00b7 \u221e = 0.\nAs suggested by their name, these functions admit a characteristic \u201cV shape\u201d. It is clear from Figure 1 that Ls,i is a v-function with a(1) = cs\ne(s) q\u0303 (s+1) i , a (2) = cs e(s)\nand \u03b7 = 0. Thus, we can apply the optimization algorithm given by Mohri and Medina (2014) to minimize (6) inO(nS log nS) time. Algorithm 1 gives the pseudocode of that the adaptation of this general algorithm to our problem. A proof of the correctness of this algorithm can be found in (Mohri and Medina, 2014).\nWe conclude this section by presenting learning guarantees for our algorithm. Our bounds are given in terms of the Rademacher complexity and the VC-dimension.\nDefinition 2. Let X be a set and let G := {g : X \u2192 R} be a family of functions. Given a sample S = (x1, . . . , xn) \u2208\nX , the empirical Rademacher complexity ofG is defined by\nR\u0302S(G) = 1 n E\u03c3 [ sup g\u2208G 1 n n\u2211 i=1 \u03c3ig(xi) ] ,\nwhere \u03c3is are independent random variables distributed uniformly over the set {\u22121, 1}.\nProposition 2. Let m = mini ei > 0 and M = \u2211S s=1 cs. Then, for any \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 over the draw of a sample S of size n, each of the following inequalities holds for all r \u2208 [0, 1]:\nE[L\u0303(r,b)] \u2264 1 n n\u2211 i=1 L\u0303(r,bi) + C(M,m, n, \u03b4) (7)\n1\nn n\u2211 i=1 L\u0303(r,bi) \u2264 E[L\u0303(r,b)] + C(M,m, n, \u03b4), (8)\nwhere C(M,m, n, \u03b4) = 1\u221a n\n+ \u221a\nlog(en) n +\n\u221a M log(1/\u03b4)\n2mn .\nProof. Let \u03a8: S 7\u2192 supr\u2208[0,1] 1n \u2211n i=1 L\u0303(r,bi) \u2212 E[L\u0303(r,b)]. Let Si be a sample obtained from S by replacing bi with b\u2032i. It is not hard to verify that |\u03a8(S) \u2212 \u03a8(Si)| \u2264 Mnm . Thus, it follows from a standard learning bound that, with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4,\nE[L\u0303(r,b)] \u2264 1 n n\u2211 i=1 L\u0303(r,bi) + R\u0302S(R) + \u221a M log(1/\u03b4) 2mn ,\nwhere R = {Lr : b 7\u2192 L\u0303(r,b)|r \u2208 [0, 1]}. We proceed to bound the empirical Rademacher complexity of the class R. For q1 > q2 \u2265 0 let L(r, q1, q2) = q21q2>r + r1q1\u2265r\u2265q2 . By definition of the Rademacher complexity we can write\nR\u0302S(R) = 1 n E\u03c3 [ sup r\u2208[0,1] n\u2211 i=1 \u03c3iLr(bi) ]\n= 1 n E\u03c3 [ sup r\u2208[0,1] n\u2211 i=1 \u03c3i S\u2211 s=1 cs es L(r, q\u0303 (s) i , q\u0303 (s+1) i ) ] \u2264 1 n E\u03c3 [ S\u2211 s=1 sup r\u2208[0,1] n\u2211 i=1 \u03c3i\u03c8s(L(r, q\u0303 (s) i , q\u0303 (s+1) i )) ] ,\nwhere \u03c8s is the csm -Lipschitz function mapping x 7\u2192 cs e(s) x. Therefore, by Talagrand\u2019s contraction lemma (Ledoux and Talagrand, 2011), the last term is bounded by S\u2211 s=1 cs nm E\u03c3 sup r\u2208[0,1] n\u2211 i=1 \u03c3iL(r, q\u0303 (s) i , q\u0303 (s+1) i )= S\u2211 s=1 cs m R\u0302Ss(R\u0303),\nwhere Ss = ( (q\u0303 (s) 1 , q\u0303 (s+1) 1 ), . . . , (q\u0303 (s) n , q\u0303 (s+1) n ) ) and R\u0303 := {L(r, \u00b7, \u00b7)|r \u2208 [0, 1]}. The loss L(r, q\u0303(s), q\u0303(s+1)) in fact evaluates to the negative revenue of a second-price auction\nwith highest bid q\u0303(s) and second highest bid q\u0303(s+1) (Mohri and Medina, 2014). Therefore, by Propositions 9 and 10 of Mohri and Medina (2014) we can write\nR\u0302Ss(R\u0303) \u2264 1 n E\u03c3 [ sup r\u2208[0,1] n\u2211 i=1 r\u03c3i ] + \u221a 2 log en n\n\u2264 ( 1\u221a\nn +\n\u221a 2 log en\nn\n) ,\nwhich concludes the proof.\nCorollary 1. Under the hypotheses of Proposition 2, let r\u0302 denote the empirical minimizer and r\u2217 the minimizer of the expected loss. Then, for any \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4, the following inequality holds:\nE[L\u0303(r\u0302,b)]\u2212 E[L\u0303(r\u2217,b)] \u2264 2C ( M,m, n, \u03b4\n2\n) .\nProof. By the union bound, (7) and (8) hold simultaneously with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4 if \u03b4 is replaced by \u03b4/2 in those expression. Adding both inequalities and using the fact that r\u0302 is an empirical minimizer yields the result.\nIt is worth noting that our algorithm is well defined whether or not the buyers bid in equilibrium. Indeed, the algorithm consists of the minimization over r of an observable quantity. While we can guarantee convergence to a solution of (1) only when buyers play a symmetric BNE, our algorithm will still find an approximate solution to\nmin r\u2208[0,1]\nEb[L(r,b)],\nwhich remains a quantity of interest that can be close to (1) if buyers are close to the equilibrium."}, {"heading": "5 CONVERGENCE OF EMPIRICAL EQUILIBRIA", "text": "A crucial assumption in the study of GSP auctions, including this work, is that advertisers bid in a Bayes-Nash equilibrium (Lucier et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2014). This assumption is partially justified by the fact that advertisers can infer the underlying distribution F using as observations the outcomes of the past repeated auctions and can thereby implement an efficient equilibrium.\nIn this section, we provide a stronger theoretical justification in support of this assumption: we quantify the difference between the bidding function calculated using observed empirical distributions and the true symmetric bidding function in equilibria. For the sake of notation simplicity, we will consider only the rank-by-bid GSP auction.\nLet Sv = (v1, . . . , vn) be an i.i.d. sample of values drawn from a continuous distribution F with density function f .\nAssume without loss of generality that v1 \u2264 . . . \u2264 vn and let v denote the vector defined by vi = vi. Let F\u0302 denote the empirical distribution function induced by Sv and let F \u2208 Rn and G \u2208 Rn be defined by Fi = F\u0302 (vi) = i/n and Gi = 1\u2212 Fi.\nWe consider a discrete GSP auction where the advertiser\u2019s valuations are i.i.d. samples drawn from a distribution F\u0302 . In the event where two or more advertisers admit the same valuation, ties are broken randomly. Denote by \u03b2\u0302 the bidding function for this auction in equilibrium (when it exists). We are interested in characterizing \u03b2\u0302 and in providing guarantees on the convergence of \u03b2\u0302 to \u03b2 as the sample size increases.\nWe first introduce the notation used throughout this section.\nDefinition 3. Given a vector F \u2208 Rn, the backwards difference operator \u2206 : Rn \u2192 Rn is defined as:\n\u2206Fi = Fi \u2212 Fi\u22121,\nfor i > 1 and \u2206F1 = F1.\nWe will denote \u2206\u2206Fi by \u22062Fi. Given any k \u2208 N and a vector F, the vector Fk is defined as Fki = (Fi)\nk. Let us now define the discrete analog of the function zs that quantifies the probability of winning slot s.\nProposition 3. In a symmetric efficient equilibrium of the discrete GSP, the probability z\u0302s(v) that an advertiser with valuation v is assigned to slot s is given by\nz\u0302s(v)\n= N\u2212s\u2211 j=0 s\u22121\u2211 k=0 ( N \u2212 1 j, k,N\u22121\u2212j\u2212k ) Fji\u22121G k i (N \u2212 j \u2212 k)nN\u22121\u2212j\u2212k ,\nif v = vi and otherwise by\nz\u0302s(v) = ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) lim v\u2032\u2192v\u2212 F\u0302 (v\u2032)p(1\u2212 F\u0302 (v))s\u22121 =: z\u0302\u2212s (v),\nwhere p = N \u2212 s.\nIn particular, notice that z\u0302\u2212s (vi) admits the simple expression\nz\u0302\u2212s (vi) = ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) Fpi\u22121G s\u22121 i\u22121 ,\nwhich is the discrete version of the function zs. On the other hand, even though z\u0302s(vi) does not admit a closedform, it is not hard to show that\nz\u0302s(vi) = ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) Fpi\u22121G s\u22121 i +O ( 1 n ) . (9)\nWhich again can be thought of as a discrete version of zs. The proof of this and all other propositions in this section\nare deferred to the Appendix. Let us now define the lower triangular matrix M(s) by:\nMij(s) = \u2212 ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) n\u2206Fpj\u2206G s i s ,\nfor i > j and\nMii(s) = N\u2212s\u22121\u2211 j=0 s\u22121\u2211 k=0 ( N \u2212 1 j, k,N\u22121\u2212j\u2212k ) Fji\u22121G k i (N\u2212j\u2212k)nN\u22121\u2212j\u2212k .\nProposition 4. If the discrete GSP auction admits a symmetric efficient equilibrium, then its bidding function \u03b2\u0302 satisfies \u03b2\u0302(vi) = \u03b2i, where \u03b2 is the solution of the following linear equation.\nM\u03b2 = u, (10) with M = \u2211S s=1 csM(s) and ui = \u2211S s=1 ( cszs(vi)vi \u2212\u2211i\nj=1 z\u0302 \u2212 s (vj)\u2206vj\n) .\nTo gain some insight about the relationship between \u03b2\u0302 and \u03b2, we compare equations (10) and (2). An integration by parts of the right-hand side of (2) and the change of variable G(v) = 1\u2212 F (v) show that \u03b2 satisfies\nS\u2211 s=1 csvzs(v)\u2212 \u222b v 0 dzs(t) dt tdt\n= S\u2211 s=1 cs ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) G(v)s\u22121 \u222b v 0 \u03b2(t)dF p. (11)\nOn the other hand, equation (10) implies that for all i\nui = S\u2211 s=1 cs [ Mii(s)\u03b2i \u2212 ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) n\u2206Gsi s i\u22121\u2211 j=1 \u2206Fpj\u03b2j ] . (12) Moreover, by Lemma 2 and Proposition 10 in the Appendix, the equalities \u2212n\u2206G s i\ns = G s\u22121 i +O ( 1 n ) and\nMii(s) = 1\n2n ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) pFp\u22121i\u22121G s\u22121 i +O ( 1 n2 ) ,\nhold. Thus, equation (12) resembles a numerical scheme for solving (11) where the integral on the right-hand side is approximated by the trapezoidal rule. Equation (11) is in fact a Volterra equation of the first kind with kernel\nK(t, v) = S\u2211 s=1 ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) G(v)s\u22121pF p\u22121(t).\nTherefore, we could benefit from the extensive literature on the convergence analysis of numerical schemes for this type of equations (Baker, 1977; Kress et al., 1989; Linz, 1985). However, equations of the first kind are in general\nill-posed problems (Kress et al., 1989), that is small perturbations on the equation can produce large errors on the solution. When the kernel K satisfies mint\u2208[0,1]K(t, t) > 0, there exists a standard technique to transform an equation of the first kind to an equation of the second kind, which is a well posed problem. Thus, making the convergence analysis for these types of problems much simpler. The kernel function appearing in (11) does not satisfy this property and therefore these results are not applicable to our scenario. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no quadrature method for solving Volterra equations of the first kind with vanishing kernel.\nIn addition to dealing with an uncommon integral equation, we need to address the problem that the elements of (10) are not exact evaluations of the functions defining (11) but rather stochastic approximations of these functions. Finally, the grid points used for the numerical approximation are also random.\nIn order to prove convergence of the function \u03b2\u0302 to \u03b2 we will make the following assumptions\nAssumption 1. There exists a constant c > 0 such that f(x) > c for all x \u2208 [0, 1].\nThis assumption is needed to ensure that the difference between consecutive samples vi \u2212 vi\u22121 goes to 0 as n\u2192\u221e, which is a necessary condition for the convergence of any numerical scheme.\nAssumption 2. The solution \u03b2 of (10) satisfies vi,\u03b2i \u2265 0 for all i and maxi\u22081,...,n \u2206\u03b2i \u2264 C\u221an , for some universal constant C.\nSince \u03b2i is a bidding strategy in equilibrium, it is reasonable to expect that vi \u2265 \u03b2i \u2265 0. On the other hand, the assumption on \u2206\u03b2i is related to the smoothness of the solution. If the function \u03b2 is smooth, we should expect the approximation \u03b2\u0302 to be smooth too. Both assumptions can in practice be verified empirically, Figure 2 depicts the quantity maxi\u22081,...,n \u2206\u03b2i as a function of the sample size n.\nAssumption 3. The solution \u03b2 to (2) is twice continuously differentiable.\nThis is satisfied if for instance the distribution function F is twice continuously differentiable. We can now present our main result.\nTheorem 3. If Assumptions 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied, then, for any \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4 over the draw of a sample of size n, the following bound holds for all i \u2208 [1, n]:\n|\u03b2\u0302(vi)\u2212 \u03b2(vi)| \u2264 eC [ log( 2\u03b4 ) N 2\n\u221a n\nq ( n, 2\n\u03b4\n)3 + Cq(n, 2\u03b4 )\nn3/2\n] .\nwhere q(n, \u03b4) = 2c log(nc/2\u03b4) with c defined in Assumption 1, and where C is a universal constant.\nThe proof of this theorem is highly technical, thus, we defer it to Appendix F."}, {"heading": "6 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "Here we present preliminary experiments showing the advantages of our algorithm.

Here, F1 is truncated to have support in [0, 1.5] and the support of F2 = [0, 2.5]. We consider a GSP with N = 4 advertisers with S = 3 slots and position factors c1 = 1, c2 =, 45 and c3 = 1. Based on the results of Section 5 we estimate the bidding function \u03b2 with a sample of 2000 points and we show its plot in Figure 4. We proceed to evaluate the method proposed by Sun et al. (2014) for\nrecovering advertisers valuations from bids in equilibrium. The assumption made by the authors is that the advertisers play a SNE in which case valuations can be inferred by solving a simple system of inequalities defining the SNE (Varian, 2007). Since the authors do not specify which SNE the advertisers are playing we select the one that solves the SNE conditions with equality.\nWe generated a sample S consisting of n = 300 i.i.d. outcomes of our simulated auction. Since N = 4, the effective size of this sample is of 1200 points. We generated the outcome bid vectors bi, . . . ,bn by using the equilibrium bidding function \u03b2. Assuming that the bids constitute a SNE we estimated the valuations and Figure 5 shows an histogram of the original sample as well as the histogram of the estimated valuations. It is clear from this figure that this procedure does not accurately recover the distribution of the valuations. By contrast, the histogram of the estimated valuations using our density estimation algorithm is shown in Figure 5(c). The kernel function used by our algorithm was a triangular kernel given by K(u) = (1 \u2212 |u|)1|u|\u22641. Following the experimental setup of Guerre et al. (2000) the bandwidth h was set to h = 1.06\u03c3\u0302n1/5, where \u03c3\u0302 denotes the standard deviation of the sample of bids.\nFinally, we use both our density estimation algorithm and discriminative learning algorithm to infer the optimal value of r.

We show that the algorithm admits an efficient O(nS log(nS)) implementation. Furthermore, our theoretical guarantees are more favorable than those presented for the previous algorithm of Sun et al.

Moreover, even though it is necessary for advertisers to play in equilibrium for our algorithm to converge to optimality, when bidders do not play an equilibrium, our algorithm is still well defined and minimizes a quantity of interest albeit over a smaller set. We also presented preliminary experimental results showing the advantages of our algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply learning algorithms to the problem of reserve price selection in GSP auctions. We believe that the use of learning algorithms in revenue optimization is crucial and that this work may preface a rich research agenda including extensions of this work to a general learning setup where auctions and advertisers are represented by features. Additionally, in our analysis, we considered two different ranking rules. It would be interesting to combine the algorithm of Zhu et al. (2009) with this work to learn both a ranking rule and an optimal reserve price.

For the most part, we adapt the analysis of Gomes and Sweeney (2014) to a discrete setting.\nProposition 3. In a symmetric efficient equilibrium of the discrete GSP, the probability z\u0302s(v) that an advertiser with\nvaluation v is assigned to slot s is given by\nz\u0302s(v)\n= N\u2212s\u2211 j=0 s\u22121\u2211 k=0 ( N \u2212 1 j, k,N\u22121\u2212j\u2212k ) Fji\u22121G k i (N \u2212 j \u2212 k)nN\u22121\u2212j\u2212k ,\nif v = vi and otherwise by\nz\u0302s(v) = ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) lim v\u2032\u2192v\u2212 F\u0302 (v\u2032)p(1\u2212 F\u0302 (v))s\u22121 =: z\u0302\u2212s (v),\nwhere p = N \u2212 s.\nProof. Since advertisers play an efficient equilibrium, these probabilities depend only on the advertisers\u2019 valuations. Let Aj,k(s, v) denote the event that j buyers have a valuation lower than v, k of them have a valuation higher than v and N \u2212 1 \u2212 j \u2212 k a valuation exactly equal to v. Then, the probability of assigning s to an advertiser with value v is given by\nN\u2212s\u2211 j=0 s\u22121\u2211 k=0\n1\nN \u2212 i\u2212 j Pr(Aj,k(s, v)). (14)\nThe factor 1N\u2212i\u2212j appears due to the fact that the slot is randomly assigned in the case of a tie. When v = vi, this probability is easily seen to be:(\nN \u2212 1 j, k,N\u22121\u2212j\u2212k\n) Fji\u22121G k i\nnN\u22121\u2212j\u2212k .\nOn the other hand, if v \u2208 (vi\u22121, vi) the event Aj,k(s, v) happens with probability zero unless j = N \u2212 s and k = s\u2212 1. Therefore, (14) simplifies to(\nN\u22121 s\u22121\n) F\u0302 (v)p(1\u2212 F\u0302 (v))s\u22121\n= ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) lim v\u2032\u2192v\u2212 F\u0302 (v\u2032)p(1\u2212 F\u0302 (v))s\u22121.\nProposition 6. Let E[PPE(v)] denote the expected payoff of an advertiser with value v at equilibrium. Then E[PPE(vi)] = S\u2211 s=1 cs [ z\u0302s(vi)vi \u2212 \u2211 j=1 z\u0302\u2212s (vi)(vi \u2212 vi\u22121) ] .\nProof. By the revelation principle (Gibbons, 1992), there exists a truth revealing mechanism with the same expected payoff function as the GSP with bidders playing an equilibrium. For this mechanism, we then must have\nv \u2208 arg max v\u2208[0,1] S\u2211 s=1 csz\u0302s(v)v \u2212 E[PPE(v)].\nBy the envelope theorem (see Theorem 4), we have S\u2211 s=1 csz\u0302s(vi)vi\u2212E[PPE(vi)] = \u2212E[PPE(0)]+ S\u2211 s=1 \u222b vi 0 z\u0302s(t)dt.\nSince the expected payoff of an advertiser with valuation 0 should be zero too, we see that\nE[PPE(vi)] = csz\u0302s(vi)vi \u2212 \u222b vi\n0\nz\u0302s(t)dt.\nUsing the fact that z\u0302s(t) \u2261 z\u0302\u2212s (vi) for t \u2208 (vi\u22121, vi) we obtain the desired expression.\nProposition 4. If the discrete GSP auction admits a symmetric efficient equilibrium, then its bidding function \u03b2\u0302 satisfies \u03b2\u0302(vi) = \u03b2i, where \u03b2 is the solution of the following linear equation:\nM\u03b2 = u. where M = \u2211S s=1 csM(s) and\nui = S\u2211 s=1 ( cszs(vi)vi \u2212 i\u2211 j=1 z\u0302\u2212s (vj)\u2206vj ) .\nProof. Let E[P \u03b2\u0302(vi)] denote the expected payoff of an advertiser with value vi when all advertisers play the bidding function \u03b2\u0302. Let A(s, vi, vj) denote the event that an advertiser with value vi gets assigned slot s and the s-th highest valuation among the remaining N \u2212 1 advertisers is vj . If the event A(s, vi, vj) takes place, then the advertiser has a expected payoff of cs\u03b2(vj). Thus,\nE[P \u03b2(vi)] = S\u2211 s=1 cs i\u2211 j=1 \u03b2(vj) Pr(A(s, vi, vj)).\nIn order for event A(s, vi, vj) to occur for i 6= j, N \u2212 s advertisers must have valuations less than or equal to vj with equality holding for at least one advertiser. Also, the valuation of s\u2212 1 advertisers must be greater than or equal to vi. Keeping in mind that a slot is assigned randomly in the event of a tie, we see that A(s, vi, vj) occurs with probability N\u2212s\u22121\u2211 l=0 s\u22121\u2211 k=0 ( N\u22121 s\u22121 )( s\u22121 k )( N\u2212s l ) Flj\u22121 nN\u2212s\u2212l Gs\u22121\u2212ki (k + 1)nk\n= ( N\u22121 s\u22121 )N\u2212s\u22121\u2211 l=0 ( N\u2212s l ) Flj\u22121 nN\u2212s\u2212l s\u22121\u2211 k=0 ( s\u22121 k ) Gs\u22121\u2212ki (k + 1)nk\n= ( N\u22121 s\u22121 )(( Fj\u22121 + 1 n )N\u2212s \u2212 FN\u2212sj\u22121 )(n(Gsi\u22121 \u2212Gsi )s ) = \u2212 ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) n\u2206Fj\u2206Gi s ,\nwhere the second equality follows from an application of the binomial theorem and Proposition 5. On the other hand if i = j this probability is given by: N\u2212s\u22121\u2211 j=0 s\u22121\u2211 k=0 ( N \u2212 1 j, k,N \u2212 1\u2212 j \u2212 k ) Fji\u22121G k i (N \u2212 j \u2212 k)nN\u22121\u2212j\u2212k\nIt is now clear that M(s)i,j = Pr(A(s, vi, vj)) for i \u2265 j. Finally, given that in equilibrium the equality E[PPE(v)] = E[P \u03b2\u0302(v)] must hold, by Proposition 6, we see that \u03b2 must satisfy equation (10).\nWe conclude this section with a simpler expression for Mii(s). By adding and subtracting the term j = N \u2212 s in the expression defining Mii(s) we obtain Mii(s) = z\u0302s(vi)\u2212 s\u22121\u2211 k=0 ( N\u22121 N\u2212s, k, s\u22121\u2212k ) Fpi\u22121G k i (s\u2212 k)ns\u22121\u2212k\n= z\u0302s(vi)\u2212 ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) s\u22121\u2211 k=1 ( s\u2212 1 k ) Fpi\u22121G k i (s\u2212 k)ns\u22121\u2212k\n= z\u0302s(vi) + ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) Fpi\u22121 n\u2206Gi s , (15)\nwhere again we used Proposition 5 for the last equality."}, {"heading": "D HIGH PROBABILITY BOUNDS", "text": "In order to improve the readability of our proofs we use a fixed variableC to refer to a universal constant even though this constant may be different in different lines of a proof.\nTheorem 5.

It is clear that the new equation is obtained from (10) by subtracting row i\u22121 from row i. Therefore \u03b2 must also satisfy this equation. The expression for dMij follows directly from the definition of Mij . Finally,\nz\u0302s(vi)vi \u2212 i\u2211\nj=1\nz\u0302\u2212s (vj)(vj \u2212 vj\u22121)\n\u2212 ( z\u0302s(vi\u22121)vi\u22121 \u2212 i\u22121\u2211 j=1 z\u0302\u2212s (vj)(vj \u2212 vj\u22121) )\n= vi ( z\u0302s(vi)\u2212 z\u0302\u2212s (vi) ) + z\u0302\u2212s (vi)vi \u2212 z\u0302s(vi\u22121)vi\u22121 \u2212 z\u0302\u2212s (vi)(vi \u2212 vi\u22121).\nSimplifying terms and summing over s yields the desired expression for dui.\nA straightforward bound on the difference |\u03b2i\u2212\u03b2(vi)| can be obtain by bounding the following quantity: difference\ni\u2211 j=1 dMi,j(\u03b2(vi)\u2212 \u03b2i) = i\u2211 j=1 dMi,j\u03b2(vi)\u2212 dui, (23)\nand by then solving the system of inequalities defining i = |\u03b2(vi) \u2212 \u03b2i|. In order to do this, however, it is always assumed that the diagonal terms of the matrix satisfy mini ndMii \u2265 c > 0 for all n, which in view of (19) does not hold in our case. We therefore must resort to a different approach. We will first show that for values of i \u2264 n3/4 the values of \u03b2i are close to vi and similarly \u03b2(vi) will be close to vi. Therefore for i \u2264 n3/4 we can show that the difference |\u03b2(vi) \u2212 \u03b2i| is small. We will see that the analysis for i n3/4 is in fact more complicated; yet, by a clever manipulation of the system (10) we are able to obtain the desired bound.\nProposition 12. If cS > 0 then there exists a constant C > 0 such that:\nS\u2211 s=1 csMii(s) \u2265 C ( i n )N\u2212S\u22121 1 2n\nProof. By definition of Mii(s) it is immediate that\ncsMii(s) \u2265 cs 2n ( N \u2212 1 s\u2212 1 ) pFp\u22121i\u22121 (Gi) s\u22121\n= 1\n2n Cs ( i\u2212 1 n )p\u22121( 1\u2212 i n )s\u22121 ,\nwith CS = csp ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) . The sum can thus be lower bounded as follows S\u2211 s=1 csM(s)ii \u2265 1 2n max { C1 ( i\u2212 1 n )N\u22122 , (24)\nCS ( i\u2212 1 n )N\u2212S\u22121( 1\u2212 i n )S\u22121} .\nWhen C1 ( i\u22121 n )N\u22122 \u2265 CS ( i\u22121 n )N\u2212S\u22121( 1\u2212 in )S\u22121 , we have K i\u22121n \u2265 1 \u2212 i n , with K = (C1/CS)\n1/(S\u22121). Which holds if and only if i > n+KK+1 . In this case the max term of (24) is easily seen to be lower bounded by C1(K/K + 1)N\u22122. On the other hand, if i < n+KK+1 then we can lower\nbound this term by CS(K/K + 1)s\u22121 ( i n )N\u2212S\u22121 . The result follows immediately from these observations.\nProposition 13.

(26)\nProof. It is immediate by replacing the expression for dui from the previous corollary into (22) and rearranging terms.\nWe can now present the main result of this section.\nProposition 14. Under Assumption 2, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, the solution \u03c8 of equation (26) satisfies \u03c8i \u2264 C i 2\nn2 q(n, \u03b4).\nProof. By doing forward substitution on equation (26) we have:\ndMi,i\u22121\u03c8i\u22121 + dMii\u03c8i\n= pi + i\u22122\u2211 j=1 dMij\u03c8j\n= pi + S\u2211 s=1 cs n\u22062Gsi s i\u22122\u2211 j=1 \u2206Fpj\u03c8j . (27)\nA repeated application of Lemma 2 shows that\npi \u2264 C 1\nn\niN\u2212S nN\u2212S i\u2211 j=1 \u2206vj ,\nwhich by Proposition 7 we know it is bounded by\npi \u2264 C 1\nn\niN\u2212S\u22121 nN\u2212S\u22121 i2 n2 q(n, \u03b4).\nSimilarly for j \u2264 i\u2212 2 we have\nn\u22062Gsi s \u2206Fpj \u2264 C 1 n iN\u2212S\u22121 nN\u2212S\u22121 1 n .\nFinally, Assumption 2 implies that\u03c8 \u2265 0 for all i and since dMi,i\u22121 > 0, the following inequality must hold for all i:\ndMii\u03c8i \u2264 dMi,i\u22121\u03c8i\u22121 + dMii\u03c8i\n\u2264 C 1 n\niN\u2212S\u22121 nN\u2212S\u22121 ( i2 n2 q(n, \u03b4) + 1 n i\u22122\u2211 j=1 \u03c8j ) .\nIn view of Proposition 12 we know that dMii \u2265 C 1n iN\u2212S\u22121 nN\u2212S\u22121 , therefore after dividing both sides of the inequality by dMii, it follows that\n\u03c8i \u2264 C i2\nn2 q(n, \u03b4) +\n1\nn i\u22122\u2211 j=1 \u03c8j .\nApplying Lemma 3 with A = C i 2\nn2 , r = 0 and B = C n we\narrive to the following inequality:\n\u03c8i \u2264 C i2\nn2 q(n, \u03b4)eC\ni n \u2264 C \u2032 i\n2\nn2 q(n, \u03b4).\nWe now present an analogous result for the solution \u03b2 of (2).Let CS = cs ( N\u22121 s\u22121 ) and define the functions\nFs(v) = CsF N\u2212s(v) Gs(v) = G(v) s\u22121.\nIt is not hard to verify that zs(v) = Fs(v)Gs(v) and that the integral equation (2) is given by\nS\u2211 s=1 \u222b v 0 t(Fs(t)Gs(t)) \u2032dt = S\u2211 s=1 Gs(v) \u222b v 0 \u03b2(t)F\u2032s(t)dt\n(28) After differentiating this equation and rearranging terms we obtain\n0 = (v \u2212 \u03b2(v)) S\u2211 s=1 Gs(v)F \u2032 s(v)\n+ S\u2211 s=1 G\u2032s(v) \u222b v 0 \u03b2(t)F\u2032s(t)dt+ vG \u2032 s(v)Fs(v)\n= (v \u2212 \u03b2(v)) S\u2211 s=1 Gs(v)F \u2032 s(v)\n+ S\u2211 s=1 G\u2032s(v) \u222b v 0 (t\u2212 \u03b2(t))F\u2032s(t)dt+ G\u2032s(v) \u222b v 0 Fs(t)dt,\nwhere the last equality follows from integration by parts. Notice that the above equation is the continuous equivalent of equation (26). Letting \u03c8(v) := v \u2212 \u03b2(v) we have that \u03c8(v) = \u2212 \u2211S s=1 G \u2032 s(v) \u222b v 0 Fs(t)dt+ G \u2032 s(v) \u222b v 0 \u03c8(t)F\u2032s(t)dt\u2211S\ns=1 Gs(v)F \u2032 s(v)\n(29) Since limv\u21920 Gs(v) = limv\u21920 G\u2032s(v)/f(v) = 1 and\nlimv\u21920 Fs(v) = 0, it is not hard to see that\n\u2212 \u03c8(0)\n= lim v\u21920\n\u2211S s=1 G \u2032 s(v) \u222b v 0 Fs(t)dt+ G \u2032 s(v) \u222b v 0 \u03c8(t)F\u2032s(t)dt\u2211S\ns=1 Gs(v)F \u2032 s(v)\n= lim v\u21920\nf(v) (\u2211S\ns=1 G\u2032s(v) f(v) \u222b v 0 Fs(t)dt+ G\u2032s(v) f(v) \u222b v 0 \u03c8(t)F\u2032s(t)dt ) \u2211S s=1 Gs(v)F \u2032 s(v)\n= lim v\u21920\nf(v) (\u2211S\ns=1 \u222b v 0 Fs(t)dt+ \u222b v 0 \u03c8(t)F\u2032s(t)dt ) \u2211S s=1 F \u2032 s(v)\nSince the smallest power in the definition of Fs is attained at s = S, the previous limit is in fact equal to:\nlim v\u21920\nf(v) ( \u222b v\n0 FS(t)dt+ \u222b v 0 \u03c8(t)F\u2032S(t)dt ) F\u2032S(v)\n= lim v\u21920\n\u222b v 0 FN\u2212S(t)dt+ \u222b v 0\n(N\u2212S)\u03c8(t)FN\u2212S\u22121(t)f(t)dt (N\u2212S)FN\u2212S\u22121(v)\nUsing L\u2019Hopital\u2019s rule and simplifying we arrive to the following:\n\u03c8(0) = \u2212 lim v\u21920\nF 2(v)\n(N \u2212 S)(N \u2212 S \u2212 1)f(v) +\n\u03c8(v)F (v)\n(N \u2212 S \u2212 1) Moreover, since \u03c8 is a continuous function, it must be bounded and therefore, the previous limit is equal to 0. Using the same series of steps we also see that:\n\u2212 \u03c8\u2032(0)\n= lim v\u21920\n\u03c8(v)\nv\n= lim v\u21920\n\u222b v 0 FN\u2212S(t)dt+ \u222b v 0\n(N\u2212S)\u03c8(t)FN\u2212S\u22121(t)f(t)dt v(N \u2212 S)FN\u2212S\u22121(v)\nBy L\u2019Hopital\u2019s rule again we have the previous limit is equal to\nlim v\u21920 FN\u2212S(v) + (N \u2212 S)\u03c8(v)FN\u2212S\u22121(v)f(v) (N\u2212S)(N\u2212S\u22121)FN\u2212S\u22122(v)f(v)v + (N\u2212S)FN\u2212S\u22121(v) (30) Furthermore, notice that\nlim v\u21920 FN\u2212S(v) + (N \u2212 S)\u03c8(v)FN\u2212S\u22121(v)f(v) (N \u2212 S)(N \u2212 S \u2212 1)FN\u2212S\u22122(v)f(v)v\n= lim v\u21920\nF 2(v)\n(N \u2212 S)(N \u2212 S \u2212 1)f(v)v +\n\u03c8(v)F (v)\n(N \u2212 S \u2212 1)v = 0.\nWhere for the last equality we used the fact that limv\u21920 F (v) v = f(0) and \u03c8(0) = 0. Similarly, we have:\nlim v\u21920 FN\u2212S(v) + (N \u2212 S)\u03c8(v)FN\u2212S\u22121(v)f(v) (N \u2212 S)FN\u2212S\u22121(v)\n= lim v\u21920\nF (v)\nN \u2212 S + \u03c8(v)f(v) = 0\nSince the terms in the denominator of (30) are positive, the two previous limits imply that the limit given by (30) is in fact 0 and therefore \u03c8\u2032(0) = 0. Thus, by Taylor\u2019s theorem we have |\u03c8(v)| \u2264 Cv2 for some constant C. Corollary 4. The following inequality holds with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4 for all i \u2264 1\nn3/4\n|\u03c8i \u2212 \u03c8(vi)| \u2264 C 1\u221a n q(n, \u03b4).\nProof. Follows trivially from the bound on \u03c8(v), Proposition 14 and the fact that i 2\nn2 \u2264 1\u221a n .\nHaving bounded the magnitude of the error for small values of i one could use the forward substitution technique used in Proposition 14 to bound the errors i = |\u03c8i \u2212 \u03c8(vi)|. Nevertheless, a crucial assumption used in Proposition 14 was the fact that \u03c8i \u2265 0. This condition, however is not necessarily verified by i. Therefore, a forward substitution technique will not work. Instead, we leverage the fact that |dMi,i\u22121\u03c8i\u22121 \u2212 dMi,i\u03c8i| is in O ( 1 n2 ) and show that the solution \u03c8 of a surrogate linear equation is close to both \u03c8 and \u03c8 implying that \u03c8i and \u03c8(vi) will be close too. Therefore let dM\u2032 denote the lower triangular matrix with dM\u2032i,j = dMi,j for j \u2264 i\u2212 2, dM\u2032i,i\u22121 = 0 and dM\u2032ii = 2dMii. Thus, we are effectively removing the problematic term dMi,i\u22121 in the analysis made by forward substitution. The following proposition quantifies the effect of approximating the original system with the new matrix dM\u2032.\nProposition 15. Let \u03c8 be the solution to the system of equations\ndM\u2032\u03c8 = p.\nThen, for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} it is true that\n|\u03c8i \u2212\u03c8| \u2264 ( 1\u221a\nn + q(n, \u03b4) n3/2\n) eC .\nProof. We can show, in the same way as in Proposition 14, that \u03c8i \u2264 C i 2\nn2 q(n, \u03b4) with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4 for all i. In particular, for i < n3/4 it is true that\n|\u03c8i \u2212\u03c8i| \u2264 C 1\u221a n q(n, \u03b4).\nOn the other hand by forward substitution we have\ndM\u2032ii\u03c8i = pi \u2212 i\u22121\u2211 j=1 dM\u2032ij\u03c8j\nand\ndMii\u03c8i = pi \u2212 i\u22121\u2211 j=1 dMij\u03c8j .\nBy using the definition of dM\u2032 we see the above equations hold if and only if\n2dMii\u03c8i = pi \u2212 i\u22122\u2211 j=1 dMij\u03c8j 2dMii\u03c8i = dMii\u03c8i + pi \u2212 dMi,i\u22121 \u2212 i\u22122\u2211 j=1 dMij\u03c8j .\nTaking the difference of these two equations yields a recurrence relation for the quantity ei = \u03c8i \u2212\u03c8i.\n2dMiiei = dMii\u03c8i \u2212 dMi,i\u22121\u03c8i\u22121 \u2212 i\u22122\u2211 j=1 dMijej .\nFurthermore we can bound dMii\u03c8i\u2212dMi,i\u22121\u03c8i\u22121 as follows:\n|dMii\u03c8i \u2212 dMi,i\u22121\u03c8i\u22121| \u2264 |dMii \u2212 dMi,i\u22121|\u03c8i\u22121 + |\u03c8i \u2212\u03c8i\u22121|dMii.\n\u2264 C i p np q(n, \u03b4) n2 + C\u221a n dMii.\nWhere the last inequality follows from Assumption 2 and Proposition 13 as well as from the fact that \u03c8i \u2264 i2 n2 q(n, \u03b4). Finally, using the same bound on dMij as in Proposition 14 gives us\n|ei| \u2264 C (q(n, \u03b4)\nni + 1\u221a n + 1 n i\u22122\u2211 j=1 ei )\n\u2264 C 1\u221a n + C n i\u22122\u2211 j=1 ei.\nApplying Lemma 3 with A = C\u221a n , B = Cn and r = n 3/4 we obtain the final bound\n|\u03c8i \u2212\u03c8i| \u2264 ( 1\u221a\nn + q(n, \u03b4) n3/2\n) eC ."}, {"heading": "F PROOF OF THEOREM 3", "text": "Proposition 16.

After replacing the values of Gs and Fs by its definitions, Proposition 10 and the fact that \u03c8(vi) \u2264 Cv2i \u2264 C i 2 n2 q 2(n, \u03b4) imply that with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4\n\u03a53(s, vi) \u2264 C ip np log(2/\u03b4)p\u22122\u221a n q(n, \u03b4/2)3.\nWe proceed to bound the term \u03a52. The bound for \u03a51 can be derived in a similar manner. By using the definition of Gs and Fs we see that \u03a52 = ( N\u22121 s\u22121 )( \u03a5 (1) 2 + \u03a5 (2) 2 ) where\n\u03a5 (1) 2 (s, i) = (n2\u22062Gsi s \u2212 (s\u2212 1)G(vi)s\u22122 ) i\u22122\u2211 j=1 \u2206Fpi \u03c8\u0302i\n\u03a5 (2) 2 (s, i)\n= ( i\u22122\u2211 j=1 \u2206Fpi \u03c8\u0302\u2212 \u222b vi 0 \u03c8(t)pF p\u22121(t)f(t)dt ) (s\u22121)G(vi)s\u22122.\nIt follows from Propositions 8 and 9 that |\u03a52(s, i)| \u2264 C i p\nnp log(2/\u03b4)p/2\u221a n q(n, \u03b4/2)2. And the same inequality holds for \u03a51. Replacing these bounds in (32) and using the fact ip\nnp \u2264 iN\u2212S nN\u2212S yields the desired inequality.\nProposition 17. For any \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4\nmax i |\u03c8(vi)\u2212\u03c8i|\n\u2264 eC ( log(2/\u03b4)N/2\u221a\nn q(n, \u03b4/2)3 +\nCq(n, \u03b4/2)\nn3/2 ) Proof.

Since dM \u2032 ii = 2Mii \u2265 2C i N\u2212S\u22121 nN\u2212S\u22121 1 n , after dividing the above inequality by dM\u2032ii we obtain\ni \u2264 C log(2/\u03b4)N/2\u221a n q(n, \u03b4/2)3 \u2212 C n i\u22122\u2211 j=1 j .\nUsing Lemma 3 again we conclude that\ni \u2264 eC ( log(2/\u03b4)N/2\u221a\nn q(n, \u03b4/2)3 +\nCq(n, \u03b4/2)\nn3/2\n)\nTheorem 3.

Our theoretical guarantees are more favorable than those previously presented in the literature. Additionally, we show that even if bidders do not play at an equilibrium, our second algorithm is still well defined and minimizes a quantity of interest. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply learning algorithms to the problem of reserve price optimization in GSP auctions. Finally, we present the first convergence analysis of empirical equilibrium bidding functions to the unique symmetric Bayesian-Nash equilibrium of a GSP.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
