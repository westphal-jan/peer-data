This goes back to the \u2018systems of spheres\u2019 in [23, 15]. Dynamic doxastic logic was proposed and investigated in [26] in order to provide a link between the (non-modal logical) belief revision and modal logics with explicit knowledge and belief operators. A similar approach was pursued in belief revision in dynamic epistemic logic [5, 34, 30, 8, 37], that continues to develop strongly [11, 31]. We focus on the proper notion of structural equivalence on models encoding knowledge and belief simultaneously. A prior investigation into that is [12], which we relate our results to at the end of the paper. Our motivation is to find suitable structural notions to reduce the complexity of planning problems. Such plans are sequences of actions, such as iterated belief revision. It is the dynamics of knowledge and belief that, after all, motivates our research.\nThe semantics of belief depends on the structural properties of models. To relate the structural properties of models to a logical language we need a notion of structural similarity, known as bisimulation. A bisimulation relation relates a modal operator to an accessibility\n\u2217DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark, {mibi,tobo,mhje}@dtu.dk \u2020LORIA, CNRS / Universite\u0301 de Lorraine, hans.van-ditmarsch@loria.fr\nML MRMC\nrelation. Plausibility models do not have an accessibility relation as such but a plausibility relation. This induces a set of accessibility relations: the most plausible worlds are the accessible worlds for the modal belief operator; and the plausible worlds are the accessible worlds for the modal knowledge operator. But it contains much more information: to each modal operator of conditional belief (or of degree of belief) one can associate a possibly distinct accessibility relation.This raises the question of how to represent the bisimulation conditions succinctly. Can this be done by reference to the plausibility relation directly, instead of by reference to these, possibly many, induced accessibility relations? It is now rather interesting to observe that relative to the modalities of knowledge and belief, the plausibility relation is already in some way too rich.\nThe plausibility model ML on the left in Figure 1 consists of five worlds. The proposition p is true in the top ones and false in the bottom ones. The reverse holds for q: true at the bottom and false at the top. The a relations in the model correspond to the plausibility order w3 >a w2 >a w1, interpreted such that the smaller of two elements in the order is the most plausible of the two. Further, everything that is comparable with the plausibility order is considered epistemically possible. We can then view the model as a standard multi-agent S5 plus an ordering on the epistemic possibilities. As w1 is the most plausible world for a, she believes p and that b believes \u00acp \u2227 q. This works differently from the usual doxastic modal logic, where belief corresponds to the accessibility relation. In the logics of belief that we study, belief is what holds in the most plausible world(s) in an epistemic equivalence class. For a the most plausible world in all three p-worlds is w1, so a believes the same formulas in all of them.\nIn w2 agent b knows p. If a is given the information that b does not consider q possible (that is, the information that neither w1 nor w3 is the actual world), then a believes that b knows p \u2013 or conditional on Kb\u00acq, a believes Kbp. Such a statement is an example of the logic of conditional belief LC defined in Section 3. In LC we write this statement as BKb\u00acqa Kbp.\nNow examine w3. We will show that w1 and w3 are modally equivalent for L C : they agree on all formulas of that language\u2014no information expressible in LC distinguishes the two worlds. This leads to the observation that no matter where we move w3 in the plausibility ordering for a, modal equivalence is preserved. Similarly, we can move w2 anywhere we like except making it more plausible than w1. If we did, then a would believe Kbp unconditionally, and the the formulas true in the model would have been changed.\nIt turns out that moving worlds about in the plausibility order can be done for all models, as long as we obey one (conceptually) simple rule: Grouping worlds into \u201cmodal equivalence classes\u201d of worlds modally equivalent to each other, we are only required to preserve the ordering between the most plausible worlds in each modal equivalence class. Only the most\nplausible world in each class matters. Another crucial observation is that standard bisimulation in terms of \u2265a does not give correspondence between bisimulation and modal equivalence. For instance, while w1 and w3 are modally equivalent, they are not \u201cstandardly\u201d bisimilar with respect to \u2265a: w3 has a \u2265a-edge to a Kbp world (w2), whereas w1 does not. Thus, the straightforward, standard definition of bisimulation does not work, because no modality in the language corresponds to the plausibility relation. Instead we have an infinite set of modalities corresponding to relations derived from the plausibility relation. One of the major contributions of this paper is a solution to exactly this problem.\nMaking w3 as plausible as w1 and appropriately renaming worlds gets us MR of Figure 1. Here the modally equivalent worlds u1 and u3 are equally plausible, modally equivalent and standardly bisimilar. This third observation gives a sense of how we solve the problem generally. Rather than using \u2265a directly, our definition of bisimulation checks accessibility with respect to a relation \u2265Ra derived from \u2265a and the bisimulation relation R itself. Postponing details for later we just note that in the present example the derived relation for ML is exactly the plausibility relation for MR. This indicates what we later prove: This new derived relation reestablishes the correspondence between bisimilarity and modal equivalence.\nThe modelMC of Figure 1 is the bisimulation contraction of the right model using standard bisimilarity. It is the bisimulation contraction of both models with the bisimulation notion informally defined in the previous paragraph. In previous work on planning with single-agent plausibility models [2], finding contractions of plausibility models is needed for decidability and complexity results. In this paper we do this for the first time for multi-agent plausibility models, opening new vistas in applications of modal logic to automated planning.\nOverview of content In Section 2 we introduce plausibility models and the proper and novel notion of bisimulation on these models, and prove various properties of bisimulation. In Section 3 we define the three logics of conditional belief, degrees of belief, and safe belief, and provide some further historical background on these logics. In Section 4 we demonstrate that bisimilarity corresponds to logical equivalence (on image-finite and preimage-finite models) for all three core logics, so that, somewhat remarkably, one could say that the content of a given model can equally well be described in any of these logics. Then, in Section 5 we determine the relative expressivity of the three logics, including more expressive combinations of their primitive modalities. The main result here is that the logics of conditional and degrees of belief are incomparable, and that the logics of degrees of belief and safe belief are incomparable, but that the logic of safe belief is (strictly) more expressive than the logic of conditional belief. In Section 6, we put our result in the perspective of other recent investigations, mainly the study by Lorenz Demey [12], and in the perspective of possible applications: decidable planning."}, {"heading": "2 Plausibility models and bisimulation", "text": "A well-preorder on a set X is a reflexive and transitive binary relation D on X such that every non-empty subset has D-minimal elements. The set of minimal elements (for D) of some Y \u2286 X is the set MinD Y defined as {y \u2208 Y | y\n\u2032 D y for all y\u2032 \u2208 Y }.1 As any twoelement subset Y = {x, y} of X also has minimal elements, we have that z D y or y D z. Thus all elements in X are D-comparable. Given subsets Y,Z \u2286 X, we define Y D Z if and only if y D z for all y \u2208 Y and all z \u2208 Z.\nGiven any binary relation R on X, we use R= to denote the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive closure of R (the equivalence closure of R). For any equivalence relation R on X,\n1This notion of minimality is non-standard and taken from [8]. Usually a minimal element of a set is an element that is not greater than any other element.\nwe write [x]R for {x \u2032 \u2208 X | (x, x\u2032) \u2208 R}. A binary relation R on X is image-finite if and only if for every x \u2208 X, {x\u2032 \u2208 X | (x, x\u2032) \u2208 R} is finite. A relation is preimage-finite if and only if for every x \u2208 X, {x\u2032 \u2208 X | (x\u2032, x) \u2208 R} is finite. We say R is (pre)image-finite if it is both image-finite and preimage-finite.\nDefinition 1 (Plausibility model) A plausibility model for a countably infinite set of propositional symbols P and a finite set of agents A is a tuple M = (W,\u2265, V ), where\n\u2022 W is a set of worlds called the domain, denoted D(W );\n\u2022 \u2265: A \u2192 P(W \u00d7W ) is a plausibility function, such that for each a \u2208 A, \u2265(a) is a set of mutually disjoint well-preorders covering W , called the plausibility relation (for agent a); each \u2265(a) is required to be (pre)image-finite;\n\u2022 V : W \u2192 2P is a valuation.\nFor w \u2208 W , (M,w) is a pointed plausibility model. \u22a3\nFor \u2265(a) we write \u2265a. If w \u2265a v then v is at least as plausible as w (for agent a), and the \u2265a-minimal elements are the most plausible worlds. For the symmetric closure of \u2265a we write \u223ca: this is an equivalence relation on W called the epistemic relation (for agent a). If w \u2265a v but v 6\u2265a w we write w >a v (v is more plausible than w), and for w \u2265a v and v \u2265a w we write w \u2243a v (w and v are equiplausible). Instead of w \u2265a v (w >a v) we may write v \u2264a w (v <a w).\nNote that we have required each relation \u2265 (a) to be (pre)image-finite. This amounts to requiring that all equivalence classes of \u223ca are finite, while still allowing infinite domains. This requirement is not part of the definition of plausibility models provided in [8]. We require it here, since it leads to simplifications without any significant reduction in generality:\n1. We will show full correspondence between bisimilarity and modal equivalence for three different logics over plausibility models. As is the case in standard modal logic, this correspondence can only be achieved for (pre)image-finite models (the direction from modal equivalence to bisimilarity only hold for such models, see e.g. [9]). Simply assuming (pre)image-finiteness from the outset simplifies the presentation, as we do not have to repeat this restriction in a large number of places.\n2. Some of our later results are going to rely on the existence of a largest autobisimulations (see below). Usually it is quite trivial to show the existence of a largest bisimulation, since the union of any set of bisimulations is a bisimulation. However, we need a nonstandard notion of bisimulation for our purposes, and for such bisimulations closure under union is far from a trivial result.2 Given our first correspondence result between bisimilarity and modal equivalence, we are however going to get this result for free (see Section 4.1).\nWe now proceed to define a notion of autobisimulation on a plausibility model. This notion is non-standard, because there is no one-to-one relation between the plausibility relation for an agent and a modality for that agent in the logics defined later. In the definition below (and from now on), we allow ourselves some further notational abbreviations. Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) denote a plausibility model. Let a \u2208 A and w \u2208 W , then we write [w]a instead of [w]\u223ca . Now let Z \u2286 [w]a, then we write MinaZ instead of Min\u2265a Z. For any binary relation R on W , we write w \u2265Ra v for Mina([w]R= \u2229 [w]a) \u2265a Mina([v]R= \u2229 [v]a). When w \u2265 R a v and v \u2265 R a w, we write w \u2243Ra v.\n2Without the restriction to (pre)image-finite models, we were unable to prove the existence of a largest bisimulation. We leave this challenge open to future research(ers).\nDefinition 2 (Autobisimulation) Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) be a plausibility model. An autobisimulation on M is a non-empty relation R \u2286 W \u00d7W such that for all (w,w\u2032) \u2208 R and for all a \u2208 A:\n[atoms] V (w) = V (w\u2032);\n[forth\u2265] If v \u2208 W and w \u2265 R a v, there is a v \u2032 \u2208 W such that w\u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032 and (v, v\u2032) \u2208 R;\n[back\u2265] If v \u2032 \u2208 W and w\u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032, there is a v \u2208 W such that w \u2265Ra v and (v, v \u2032) \u2208 R;\n[forth\u2264] If v \u2208 W and w \u2264 R a v, there is a v \u2032 \u2208 W such that w\u2032 \u2264Ra v \u2032 and (v, v\u2032) \u2208 R;\n[back\u2264] If v \u2032 \u2208 W and w\u2032 \u2264Ra v \u2032, there is a v \u2208 W such that w \u2264Ra v and (v, v \u2032) \u2208 R.\nA total autobisimulation onM is an autobisimulation withW as both domain and codomain.\u22a3\nOur bisimulation relation is non-standard in the [back] and [forth] clauses. A standard [forth] condition based on an accessibility relation \u2265a would be\nIf v \u2208 W and w \u2265a v, there is a v \u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 such that w\u2032 \u2265a v \u2032 and (v, v\u2032) \u2208 R.\nHere, R only appears in the part \u2018(v, v\u2032) \u2208 R\u2019. But in the definition of autobisimulation for plausibility models, in [forth\u2265], the relation R also features in the condition for applying [forth\u2265] and in its consequent, namely as the upper index in w \u2265 R a v and w \u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032. This means that R also determines which v are accessible from w, and which v\u2032 are accessible from w\u2032. This explains why we define an autobisimulation on a single model before a bisimulation between distinct models: We need the bisimulation relation R to determine the plausibility relation \u2265Ra from the plausibility relation \u2265a on any given model first, before structurally comparing distinct models.\nExample 1 The models ML and MR of Figure 1 are reproduced in Figure 2. Consider the relation R = Rid \u222a {(w1, w3), (w3, w1), (w4, w5), (w5, w4)}, where Rid is the identity relation on W . With this R, we get that w1 and w3 are equiplausible for \u2265 R a :\nw1 \u2243 R a w3 iff\nMina([w1]R= \u2229 [w1]a) \u2243a Mina([w3]R= \u2229 [w3]a) iff\nMina{w1, w3} \u2243a Mina{w1, w3} iff\nw1 \u2243a w1\nWe also get that w2 \u2265 R a w3:\nw2 \u2265 R a w3 iff\nMina([w2]R= \u2229 [w2]a) \u2265a Mina([w3]R= \u2229 [w3]a) iff\nMina{w2} \u2265a Mina{w1, w3} iff\nw2 \u2265a w1\nThis gives \u2265Ra = {(w1, w3), (w3, w1), (w2, w3), (w2, w1)} \u222a Rid. For b, we get \u2265 R b = \u2265b. The autobisimulation R on ML is shown in Figure 2. It should be easy to check that R is indeed an autobisimulation. To help, we will justify why (w4, w5) is in R: For \u2265 R b , we have that, as (w1, w3) \u2208 R and w1 \u2265 R b w4, there must be a world v such that w3 \u2265 R b v and (w4, v) \u2208 R. This v is w5. Note that R is the largest autobisimulation. Based on [atoms] there are only two possible candidate pairs that could potentially be added to R (modulo symmetry), namely (w1, w2) and (w2, w3). But w2 does not have a b-edge to a q world, whereas both w1 and w3 do. There is therefore nothing more to add.\nThe largest autobisimulation for MR is completely analogous, as shown in Figure 2. \u22a3\nLemma 1 LetM = (W,\u2265, V ) and R be a binary relation onW . If (w,w\u2032) \u2208 R= and w \u223ca w \u2032 then w \u2243Ra w \u2032. \u22a3\nProof From (w,w\u2032) \u2208 R= and w \u223ca w \u2032 we get [w]R= = [w \u2032]R= and [w]a = [w \u2032]a and hence [w]R= \u2229 [w]a = [w \u2032]R= \u2229 [w \u2032]a. Thus also Mina([w]R= \u2229 [w]a) = Mina([w \u2032]R= \u2229 [w\n\u2032]a), immediately implying w \u2243Ra v.\nLemma 2 Let \u2265a be a set of mutually disjoint well-preorders covering a plausibility model M = (W,\u2265, V ) and let R be a binary relation on M . Then \u2265Ra is a set of well-preorders inducing the same partition, that is, \u2265Ra partitions W into a well-preorder on each \u223caequivalence class. \u22a3\nProof The relation \u2265a partitions W into a well-preorder on each \u223ca-equivalence class. We need to show that \u2265Ra does the same. Hence we need to prove: 1) \u2265 R a is reflexive; 2) \u2265 R a is transitive; 3) any \u223ca-equivalence class has \u2265 R a -minimal elements; 4) if two worlds are related by \u2265Ra they are also related by \u223ca. Reflexivity of is trivial. Transitivity : Let (w, v), (v, u) \u2208 \u2265Ra . Then Mina([w]R= \u2229 [w]a) \u2265a Mina([v]R= \u2229 [v]a), and Mina([v]R= \u2229 [v]a) \u2265a Mina([u]R= \u2229 [u]a). Using that for any sets X,Y,Z, if X \u2265a Y and Y \u2265a Z then X \u2265a Z (transitivity of \u2265a for sets is easy to check), we obtain that Mina([w]R= \u2229 [w]a) \u2265a Mina([u]R= \u2229 [u]a) and therefore (w, u) \u2208 \u2265 R a . Minimal elements: Consider a \u223ca-equivalence class W \u2032\u2032 \u2286 W , and letW \u2032 \u2286 W \u2032\u2032 be a non-empty subset. Suppose W \u2032 does not have \u2265Ra minimal elements. Then for all w \u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 there is a w\u2032\u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 such that w\u2032\u2032 <Ra w \u2032, i.e. Mina([w \u2032\u2032]R=\u2229[w \u2032\u2032]a) <a Mina([w \u2032]R=\u2229[w \u2032]a). As w \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]R=\u2229[w \u2032]a, we get {w\u2032} \u2265a Mina([w \u2032]R= \u2229 [w \u2032]a) and then Mina([w \u2032\u2032]R= \u2229 [w \u2032\u2032]a) <a {w \u2032}. In other words, for all w\u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 there is a u \u2208 W , namely any u \u2208 Mina([w \u2032\u2032]R= \u2229 [w \u2032\u2032]a), such that u <a w \u2032. This contradicts \u2265a being a well-preorder on W \u2032\u2032. We have now shown 1), 2) and 3). Finally we show 4): Assume w \u2265Ra v, that is, Mina([w]R= \u2229 [w]a) \u2265a Mina([v]R= \u2229 [v]a). This implies the existence of an x \u2208 Mina([w]R= \u2229 [w]a) and a y \u2208 Mina([w]R= \u2229 [v]a) with x \u2265a y. By choice of x and y we have x \u223ca w and y \u223ca v. From x \u2265a y we get x \u223ca y. Hence we have w \u223ca x \u223ca y \u223ca v, as required.\nProposition 1 On any plausibility model there exists a largest autobisimulation. Furthermore, the largest autobisimulation is an equivalence relation. \u22a3\nWe postpone the proof of this result to Section 4.1, since it is going to follow from the correspondence between bisimilarity and modal equivalence for our language of conditional belief (Theorem 1). Let us already now reassure the reader that we are not risking any circular reasoning here: None of the results that lead to Theorem 1 and hence to Proposition 1 rely on largest autobisimulations.\nDefinition 3 (Bisimulation) Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) and M \u2032 = (W \u2032,\u2265\u2032, V \u2032) be plausibility models and let M \u2032\u2032 = M \u2294M \u2032 be the disjoint union of the two. Given an autobisimulation R on M \u2032\u2032, if R\u2032 = R \u2229 (W \u00d7W \u2032) is non-empty, then R\u2032 is called a bisimulation between M and M \u2032. A bisimulation between (M,w) and (M \u2032, w\u2032) is a bisimulation between M and M \u2032 containing (w,w\u2032). \u22a3\nExample 2 Take another look at MC and MR of Figure 1. Let M \u2032 = MC \u2294 MR and consider possible autobisimulations here. From Figure 2 we have the existence of a largest autobisimulation on MR. For MC , the largest autobisimulation is just the identity. Naming them RR and RC respectively, we (trivially) have that RR\u222aRC is an autobisimulation on M\n\u2032. The question is whether we can extend RR \u222a RC to an autobisimulation on M\n\u2032 connecting the submodels MR to MC . We can. This new autobisimulation is R = R\n\u2032 \u222aRR \u222aRC , where R\u2032(u1) = R \u2032(u3) = {v1}, R \u2032(u2) = {v2} and R \u2032(u4) = R \u2032(u5) = {v3}. Now we easily get a bisimulation between MR and MC as R \u2229 (D(MR) \u00d7 D(MC)) = R \u2032. Figure 3 shows the bisimulation R\u2032. \u22a3\nDefinition 4 (Bisimulation contraction) Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) be a plausibility model and let R be the largest autobisimulation on M . The bisimulation contraction of M is the model M \u2032 = (W \u2032,\u2265\u2032, V \u2032) such that W \u2032 = {[w]R | w \u2208 W}, V\n\u2032([w]R) = V (w), and for all agents a and worlds w, v \u2208 W :\n[w]R \u2265 \u2032 a [v]R iff for some w \u2032 \u2208 [w]R and v \u2032 \u2208 [v]R: w \u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032. \u22a3\nExample 3 We now compute the simulation contraction M \u2032R = (W \u2032,\u2265\u2032, V \u2032) of MR = (W,\u2265\n, V ). For \u2265\u2032a and \u2265 \u2032 b take the reflexive closures.\nW \u2032 = {{u1, u3}, {u2}, {u4, u5}} \u2265\u2032a = {({u2}, {u1, u3})} \u2265\u2032b = {{u1, u3}, {u4, u5})} V \u2032({u1, u3}) = {p} V \u2032({u2}) = {p} V \u2032({u4, u5}) = {q}\nModel MC is isomorphic to both the bisimulation contraction of ML and the bisimulation contraction of MR. \u22a3\nProposition 2 The bisimulation contraction of a plausibility model is a plausibility model and is bisimilar to that model. \u22a3\nThis proposition is not hard to prove, so we do not provide a full proof, but only sketch the overall idea. First, to prove that the bisimulation contraction (W \u2032,\u2265\u2032, V \u2032) of a plausibility model (W,\u2265, V ) is a plausibility model, we simply have to prove that the relations \u2265\u2032a are well-preorders on each \u223c\u2032a equivalence class. That is shown by first proving reflexivity of \u2265\u2032a, then transitivity of \u2265 \u2032 a, and finally by proving that any non-empty subset has minimal elements with respect to \u2265\u2032a. To show that (W,\u2265, V ) is bisimilar to (W \u2032,\u2265\u2032, V \u2032), we define the (functional) relation S : W \u2192 W \u2032 as S = {(w, [w]R) | w \u2208 W} and show that this is a bisimulation relation (that it satisfied [atoms] and the [back] and [forth] conditions).\nDefinition 5 (Normal plausibility relation, normal model) Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) be a plausibility model and let R be the largest autobisimulation on M . For all agents a, the relation \u2265Ra is the normal plausibility relation for agent a in M , for which we may also write a. The model is normal if for all a, \u2265a = \u2265 R a . Any model M can be normalised by replacing all \u2265a by \u2265 R a . \u22a3\nExample 4 Consider again the models ML and MR of Figure 2. From the largest bisimulation on ML (shown by dotted edges), we can conclude that MR is the normalisation of ML (modulo a renaming of the worlds wi to ui, for i = 1, . . . , 5). \u22a3\nProposition 3 The bisimulation contraction of a plausibility model is normal. \u22a3\nProof Let M be a plausibility model, and let M \u2032 = (W \u2032,\u2265\u2032, V \u2032) be the bisimulation contraction of M . The largest autobisimulation on M \u2032 is the identity relation Rid. For each agent a, we now have that \u2265\u2032Rida = \u2265a. Therefore, M \u2032 is normal."}, {"heading": "3 Logical language and semantics", "text": "In this section we define the language and the semantics of our logics.\nDefinition 6 (Logical language) For any countably infinite set of propositional symbols P and finite set of agents A we define language LCDSPA by:\n\u03d5 ::= p | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5 | Ka\u03d5 | B \u03d5 a\u03d5 | B n a\u03d5 | a\u03d5\nwhere p \u2208 P , a \u2208 A, and n \u2208 N. \u22a3\nThe formula Ka\u03d5 stands for \u2018agent a knows (formula) \u03d5\u2019, B \u03c8 a \u03d5 stands for \u2018agent a believes \u03d5 on condition \u03c8\u2019, Bna\u03d5 stands for \u2018agent a believes \u03d5 to degree n\u2019, and a\u03d5 stands for \u2018agent a safely believes \u03d5\u2019. (The semantics of these constructs is defined below.) The duals of Ka, B \u03d5 a and a are denoted K\u0302a, B\u0302 \u03d5 a and \u2666a. We use the usual abbreviations for the boolean connectives as well as for \u22a4 and \u22a5, and the abbreviation Ba for B \u22a4 a . In order to refer to the type of modalities in the text, we call Ka a knowledge modality, B \u03c8 a a conditional belief modality, Bna a degree of belief modality, and a a safe belief modality. In LCDSPA , if A is clear from the context, we may omit that and write L CDS P , and if P is clear from the context, we may omit that as well, so that we get LCDS. The letter C stands for \u2018conditional\u2019, D for \u2018degree\u2019, and S for \u2018safe\u2019. Let X be any subsequence of CDS, then LX is the language with, in the inductive definition, only the modalities X (and with knowledge Ka) for all agents. In our work we focus on the logic of conditional belief with language L\nC , the logic of degrees of belief with language LD, and the logic of safe belief with language LS.\nDefinition 7 (Satisfaction Relation) Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) be a plausibility model for P and A, let be the normal plausibility relation for M , and let w \u2208 W , p \u2208 P , a \u2208 A, and \u03d5,\u03c8 \u2208 LCDS .

Given are models M = (W,\u2265, V ) and M \u2032 = (W \u2032,\u2265\u2032, V \u2032), and w \u2208 W and w\u2032 \u2208 W \u2032. We say that (M,w) and (M \u2032, w\u2032) are modally equivalent in LXP , notation (M,w) \u2261 X P (M\n\u2032, w\u2032), if and only if for all \u03d5 \u2208 LXP , M,w |= \u03d5 if and only if M\n\u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03d5. If P is obvious from the context we may write (M,w) \u2261X (M \u2032, w\u2032). \u22a3\nThe logic of conditional belief\nThe logic LC of conditional belief appears in [28, 6, 30, 8], where particularly the latter two are foundational for dynamic belief revision (older roots are Lewis\u2019 counterfactual conditionals [23]). An axiomatisation is found in [28]. In this logic, defeasible belief Ba\u03d5 is definable as B\u22a4a \u03d5, while Ka\u03d5 is definable as B \u00ac\u03d5 a \u22a5.\nExample 5 Consider Figure 1. In the the plausibility model MC we have, for instance: MC |= Kap \u2192 (BaBbq \u2227 \u00acKaBbq): If a knows p (true in v1 and v2), a believes, but does not know, that b believes q. Another example is MC |= B \u00acBbq a Kb\u00acq: Conditional on b not believing q, a believes that b knows \u00acq. Only in v2 does \u00acBbq hold; there Kb\u00acq holds. A final example is MC |= Kap \u2192 B K\u0302bq a Bbq: From v1 and v2 (where Kap holds), formula K\u0302bq only\nholds in v1, and conditional to that, the one and only most plausible world v1 satisfies Bbq. We can repeat this exercise in ML and MR, as all three models are bisimilar and therefore, as will be proved in the next section, logically equivalent. \u22a3\nThe logic of degrees of belief\nThe logic LD of degrees of belief, also known as the logic of graded belief, goes back to [15, 27], although these could more properly be said to be semantic frameworks to model degrees of belief (there is no relation between the logic of degrees of belief and Fine\u2019s logic of graded belief [13] and subsequent works, wherein we count the number of pairs (v,w) \u2208 R between two worlds v and w, or, alternatively, label the accessibility relation with that number). Logics of degrees of belief have seen some popularity in artificial intelligence and AGM style belief revision, see e.g. [32, 33, 20]. Belief revision based on degrees of belief have been proposed by [5, 34]. The typical distinction between conviction (arbitrarily strong belief) and knowledge, as in [21, 22], is absent in our logic LD, wherein the strongest form of belief defines knowledge. Reasoning with degrees of belief is often called quantitative, where conditional belief can then be called qualitative. In other communities both are called qualitative, and quantitive epistemic reasoning approaches are in that case those that combine knowledge and probabilities [16]. The zeroth degree of belief B0a\u03d5 defines defeasible belief Ba\u03d5. How Spohn\u2019s work relates to dynamic belief revision as in [6] is discussed in detail in [35]. There have also been various proposals combining knowledge and belief (B\u22a4a \u03d5 or B 0 a\u03d5) in a single framework, without considering either conditional or degrees of belief, where the dynamics are temporal modalities, see [19, 18, 14]. For purposes of further discussions and the proofs in Section 4.2 we define belief layers as follows:\nDefinition 9 (Belief Layers) Let M = (W,\u2265, V ). For w \u2208 W , a \u2208 A and n \u2208 N, the nth (belief) layer of w for a is defined as Ena [w]a = Min a([w]a \\Min n\u22121 a [w]a), where we use the special case Min\u22121a [w]a = \u2205. \u22a3\nThis immediately gives the following lemma:\nLemma 3 For M = (W,\u2265, V ), w \u2208 W , a \u2208 A and n \u2208 N, we have Minna [w]a = E n a [w]a \u222a Minn\u22121a [w]a. For n such that Min n a [w]a = [w]a we have E n+1 a [w]a = \u2205. We name the smallest such n the maximum degree (for a at w). If n is the maximum degree for a at w, we have M,w |= Ka\u03d5 \u2194 B n a\u03d5. \u22a3\nIn [5, 34, 20] different layers can contain bisimilar worlds. In our approach they cannot, because we define belief degrees on the normal plausibility relation. Unlike [27] our semantics does not allow empty layers in between non-empty layers. If Ena [w]a 6= \u2205 and E n+2 a [w]a 6= \u2205, then En+1a [w]a 6= \u2205. Layers above the maximum degree will be empty, i.e. if there is a maximum degree n for a at w, as there will always be in our (pre)image-finite models, then for all degrees k > n, we have Eka [w]a = \u2205.\nExample 6 In Figure 1, we have that MC |= B 0 aB 0 b q but not MC |= B 1 aB 0 b q. The maximum degree of belief for a in MC is at either v1 and v2, where it is 1, so MC |= Ka\u03d5 \u2194 B 1 a\u03d5. This is also true in the other two models. Consider now the models P and P \u2032 in Figure 4 and an\nalternative definition of Bna not using a but \u2265a (as in [5, 34, 20, 8]). In the \u2265a-semantics we have P |= B2a\u00acq, as q is false in {y, z, w}. Only when we reach the third degree of belief does q become uncertain: P 6|= B3a\u00acq. With a-semantics, 2 is the maximum degree so P 6|= B 2 a\u00acq. This can be seen in the bisimilar model P \u2032, where P \u2032 6|= B2a\u00acq. \u22a3\nThe logic of safe belief\nThe logic LS of safe belief goes back to Stalnaker [28] and has been progressed by Baltag and Smets (for example, how it relates to conditional belief and knowledge) in [8], which also gives a detailed literature review involving the roots of conditional belief, degrees of belief, and safe belief. An agent has safe belief in a formula \u03d5 iff the agent will continue to believe \u03d5 no matter what true information conditions its belief, i.e. M,w |= a\u03d5 iff M,w |= B \u03c8 a \u03d5 for all -free \u03c8 s.t. M,w |= \u03c8. In [8] safe belief is defined as M,w |= a\u03d5 iff M,v |= \u03d5 for all v s.t. w \u2265a v. For both [28] and [8] true information are subsets of the domain containing the actual world. When this is what true information is, there is a correspondence between the two definitions (as indeed noted by Baltag and Smets). The complications of this choice are addressed in detail in [12]. For us, there is not a correspondence between the two definitions, because we can only condition on modally definable subsets. When we, as we do, define safe belief using a, this correspondence is reestablished.\nExample 7 Consider for a final time the models of Figure 1. We have MC , v1 |= aK\u0302bq, whereas MC , v2 6|= aK\u0302bq. Now consider ML and the \u2265a-version of safe belief for which we have ML, w3 6|= aK\u0302bq. For [28, 8] this is as it should be: For the subset {w2, w3} (which includes the actual world w3 as required) we have Mina({w2, w3} \u2229 [w3]a) = {w2} where ML, w2 6|= K\u0302bq. Using the a-version of safe belief, we have ML, w3 |= aK\u0302bq. For us, this is as it should be: As our conditional belief picks using J\u03c8K \u2229 [w]a, any set containing w3 must include the modally equivalent world w1. This corresponds to first normalising ML to get MR. In that model, u2 is strictly less plausible than u3. \u22a3\nThe semantics we propose for degrees of belief and safe belief are non-standard. Still, as we show in the following, these non-standard semantics and the standard semantics for conditional belief are all bisimulation invariant. This makes the results in Section 5 showing a non-trivial expressivity hierarchy between these logics even more remarkable.\n4 Bisimulation characterisation for LC, LD and LS"}, {"heading": "4.1 Bisimulation correspondence for conditional belief", "text": "In the following we prove that for the language LC bisimilarity implies modal equivalence and vice versa. This shows that our notion of bisimulation is proper for the language and models at hand.\nProposition 4 Bisimilarity implies modal equivalence for LC . \u22a3\nProof Assume (M1, w1)\u2194(M2, w2). Then, by definition, there exists an autobisimulation R on the disjoint union of M1 and M2 with (w1, w2) \u2208 R. Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) denote the disjoint union of M1 and M2. We then need to prove that (M,w1) and (M,w2) are modally equivalent in LC . We will show that for all \u03d5 in LC , for all (w,w\n\u2032) \u2208 R, if M,w |= \u03d5 then M,w\u2032 |= \u03d5. This implies the required (the other direction being symmetric). The proof is by induction on the syntactic complexity of \u03d5. The propositional cases are easy, so we only consider the cases \u03d5 = Ka\u03c8 and \u03d5 = B \u03b3 a\u03c8. Consider first \u03d5 = Ka\u03c8. In this case we assume M,w |= Ka\u03c8, that is, M,v |= \u03c8 for all v with w \u223ca v. Let v \u2032 be chosen arbitrarily with\nw\u2032 \u223ca v \u2032. We need to prove M,v\u2032 |= \u03c8. From Lemma 2 we have that \u2265Ra is a well-preorder on each \u223ca-equivalence class. Since w \u2032 \u223ca v \u2032 we hence get that either w\u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032 or v\u2032 \u2265Ra w\n\u2032. We can assume w\u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032, the other case being symmetric. Then since (w,w\u2032) \u2208 R and w\u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032, [back\u2265] gives us a v s.t. (v, v \u2032) \u2208 R and w \u2265Ra v. Lemma 2 now implies w \u223ca v, and hence M,v |= \u03c8. Since (v, v\u2032) \u2208 R, the induction hypothesis gives us M,v\u2032 |= \u03c8, and we are done. Now consider the case \u03d5 = B\u03b3a\u03c8. This case is more involved. Assume M,w |= B \u03b3 a\u03c8, that is, M,v |= \u03c8 for all v \u2208 Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a). Letting v \u2032 \u2208 Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w\n\u2032]a), we need to show M,v\u2032 |= \u03c8 (if Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w\n\u2032]a) is empty there is nothing to show). The standard approach is to use one of the back conditions to find a v with (v, v\u2032) \u2208 R and then show that M,v |= \u03c8. From this M,v\u2032 |= \u03c8 will follow, using the induction hypothesis. It is tempting to directly apply [back\u2265] to w \u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032 (or [back\u2264] to w \u2032 \u2264Ra v \u2032) to produce such a v with (v, v\u2032) \u2208 R. But unfortunately, we will not be able to conclude that such a v is in Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229[w]a), and hence not that M,v |= \u03c8. More work is needed. Instead we will first find a y in Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a), then find a y\u2032 with (y, y\u2032) \u2208 R, and only then apply [back\u2265] to y \u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032 to produce the required v. The point is here that our initial choice of y in Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a) will ensure that v is in Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a).\nAs mentioned, we want to start out choosing a y in Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a), so we need to ensure that this set is non-empty. By choice of v\u2032 we have v\u2032 \u2208 J\u03b3KM and v \u2032 \u223ca w \u2032. From v\u2032 \u223ca w \u2032 we get that w\u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032 or w\u2032 \u2264Ra v \u2032, using Lemma 2. Since also (w,w\u2032) \u2208 R, we can apply [back\u2265] or [back\u2264] to get a u such that (u, v \u2032) \u2208 R and either w \u2265Ra u or w \u2264 R a u. From (u, v\u2032) \u2208 R and v\u2032 \u2208 J\u03b3KM , we get u \u2208 J\u03b3KM , using the induction hypothesis. From the fact that either w \u2265Ra u or w \u2264 R a u we get w \u223ca u, using Lemma 2. Hence we have u \u2208 J\u03b3KM\u2229[w]a. This shows the set J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a to be non-empty. Hence also Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a) is non-empty, and we are free to choose a y in that set. Since y \u223ca w, Lemma 2 gives us that either y \u2265 R a w or w \u2265Ra y, so we can apply [forth\u2264] or [forth\u2265] to find a y \u2032 with (y, y\u2032) \u2208 R and either y\u2032 \u2265Ra w \u2032 or w\u2032 \u2265Ra y \u2032.\nClaim 1. y\u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032.\nProof of claim 1. We need to prove Mina([y \u2032]R= \u2229 [y \u2032]a) \u2265a Mina([v \u2032]R= \u2229 [v \u2032]a). We first prove that [y\u2032]R= \u2229 [y \u2032]a \u2286 J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w \u2032]a:\n\u2022 [y\u2032]R= \u2229 [y \u2032]a \u2286 J\u03b3KM : Assume y \u2032\u2032 \u2208 [y\u2032]R= \u2229 [y \u2032]a. Then (y \u2032, y\u2032\u2032) \u2208 R=. Since we also have (y, y\u2032) \u2208 R, we get (y, y\u2032\u2032) \u2208 R=. From (y, y\u2032\u2032) \u2208 R= and y \u2208 J\u03b3KM a finite sequence of applications of the induction hypothesis gives us y\u2032\u2032 \u2208 J\u03b3KM .\n\u2022 [y\u2032]R= \u2229 [y \u2032]a \u2286 [w \u2032]a: Assume y \u2032\u2032 \u2208 [y\u2032]R= \u2229 [y \u2032]a. Then y \u2032\u2032 \u223ca y \u2032. Since we have either y\u2032 \u2265Ra w \u2032 or w\u2032 \u2265Ra y \u2032, we must also have y\u2032 \u223ca w \u2032, by Lemma 2. Hence y\u2032\u2032 \u223ca y \u2032 \u223ca w \u2032\nimplying y\u2032\u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a.\nSince v\u2032 is chosen minimal in J\u03b3KM\u2229[w \u2032]a and [y \u2032]R=\u2229[y \u2032]a \u2286 J\u03b3KM\u2229[w \u2032]a we get Mina([y \u2032]R=\u2229 [y\u2032]a) \u2265a {v \u2032} \u2265a Mina([v \u2032]R= \u2229 [v \u2032]a), as required. This concludes the proof of the claim.\nBy choice of y\u2032 we have (y, y\u2032) \u2208 R, and by Claim 1 we have y\u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032. We can now finally, as promised, apply [back\u2265] to these premises to get a v s.t. (v, v \u2032) \u2208 R and y \u2265Ra v.\nClaim 2. Mina([v]R= \u2229 [v]a) \u2286 Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a).\nProof of claim 2. Let x \u2208 Mina([v]R= \u2229 [v]a). We need to prove x \u2208 Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a). We do this by proving x \u2208 J\u03b3KM , x \u2208 [w]a and {x} \u2264a Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a):\n\u2022 x \u2208 J\u03b3KM : By choice of x we have (v, x) \u2208 R =. From (v, x) \u2208 R= and (v, v\u2032) \u2208 R we get\n(v\u2032, x) \u2208 R=. From (v\u2032, x) \u2208 R= and v\u2032 \u2208 J\u03b3KM a finite sequence of applications of the induction hypothesis gives us x \u2208 J\u03b3KM .\n\u2022 x \u2208 [w]M : By choice of x we have x \u223ca v. Since y \u2265 R a v, Lemma 2 implies v \u223ca y. By\nchoice of y we have y \u223ca w, so in total we get x \u223ca v \u223ca y \u223ca w, as required.\n\u2022 {x} \u2264a Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a):\n{x} \u2264a Mina([v]R= \u2229 [v]a) by choice of x \u2264a Mina([y]R= \u2229 [y]a) since y \u2265 R a v\n\u2264a {y} \u2264a Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a) since y \u2208 Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a).\nThis concludes the proof of the claim.\nNow we are finally ready to prove M,v\u2032 |= \u03c8. Let z \u2208 Mina([v]R= \u2229 [v]a). Then z \u2208 Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [w]a), by Claim 2. Hence M,z |= \u03c8, by assumption. Since (v, z) \u2208 R\n= and (v, v\u2032) \u2208 R we get (z, v\u2032) \u2208 R=, and hence a finite sequence of applications of the induction hypothesis gives us M,v\u2032 |= \u03c8.\nWe proceed now to show the converse, that modal equivalence with regard to LC implies bisimulation. The proof has the same structure as the Hennessy-Millner approach, though appropriately modified for our purposes. Given a pair of image-finite models M and M \u2032, the standard approach is to construct a relation R \u2286 D(M) \u00d7 D(M \u2032) s.t. (w,w\u2032) \u2208 R if M,w \u2261 M \u2032, w\u2032. Using \u2666-formulas, it is then shown that R fulfils the requirements for being a bisimulation, as such formulas denote what is true at worlds accessible by whatever accessibility relation is used in the model. This means that modally equivalent worlds have modally equivalent successors, which is then used to show that R fulfils the required conditions. For our purposes this will not do, as we only have K\u0302a-formulas (i.e. for \u223ca). Instead, our equivalent to \u2666-formulas are of the form B\u0302\u03c8a \u03d5, each such formula corresponding to accessibility to the most plausible \u03c8-worlds from all worlds in an equivalence class. What we want are formulas corresponding to specific links between worlds, so we first establish that such formulas exists. We thus have formulas with the same function as \u2666-formulas serve in the standard approach.\nProposition 5 Modal equivalence with respect to LC implies bisimilarity. \u22a3\nProof Assume (M1, w) \u2261 C (M2, w \u2032). We wish to show that (M1, w)\u2194(M2, w \u2032). Let M = M1 \u2294 M2 be the disjoint union of M1 and M2. We then need to show that Q = {(v, v \u2032) \u2208 D(M) \u00d7 D(M) | M,v \u2261C M,v\u2032} is an autobisimulation on M . Note that as \u2261C is an equivalence relation, so is Q. We first show that \u2666-like formulas talking about the \u2265Qa - relations between specific worlds in M exist.\nClaim 1. Let w and w\u2032 be worlds of the model M = (W,\u2265, V ) where w \u2265Qa w\u2032. Further let \u03d5 \u2208 LC be any formula true in w\u2032. There then exists a formula \u03c8 \u2208 LC such that ([w]Q \u222a [w \u2032]Q) \u2229 [w]a = J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a and M,w |= B\u0302 \u03c8 a \u03d5.\nProof of Claim 1. If two worlds s and s\u2032 are not modally equivalent, there exists some distinguishing formula \u03a8s,s\u2032 with M,s |= \u03a8s,s\u2032 and M,s\n\u2032 6|= \u03a8s,s\u2032. As \u223ca is image-finite (since both \u2265a and its converse are) the following formula is finite:\n\u03a8t = \u2227 {\u03a8t,t\u2032 | t \u223ca t \u2032 \u2227 (t, t\u2032) 6\u2208 Q}\nThe formula \u03a8t distinguishes t from all the worlds in [t]a that it is not modally equivalent to. If there are no such worlds, \u03a8t is the empty conjunction equivalent to \u22a4.\nWe now return to our two original worlds w and w\u2032. With the assumption that M,w\u2032 |= \u03d5, we show that \u03c8 = \u03a8w\u2228\u03a8w\u2032 is a formula of the kind whose existence we claim. First note that\nJ\u03a8wKM \u2229 [w]a contains only those worlds in [w]a that are modally equivalent to w, exactly as [w]Q \u2229 [w]a does. As J\u03a8wKM \u222a J\u03a8w\u2032KM = J\u03a8w \u2228 \u03a8w\u2032KM we have ([w]Q \u222a [w \u2032]Q) \u2229 [w]a = J\u03a8w\u2228\u03a8w\u2032KM\u2229[w]a. To get M,w |= B\u0302 \u03c8 a \u03d5 we need to show that \u2203v \u2208 Mina(J\u03a8w \u2228\u03a8w\u2032KM\u2229[w]a) s.t. M,v |= \u03d5. Pick an arbitrary v \u2208 Mina([w \u2032]Q \u2229 [w\n\u2032]a). We will now show that this has the required properties.\nLet T = J\u03a8w\u2228\u03a8w\u2032KM\u2229[w]a. Since T = ([w]Q\u222a[w \u2032]Q)\u2229[w]a, Lemma 1 gives u \u2243 Q a w or u \u2243 Q a w\u2032 for all u \u2208 T . Together with w \u2265Qa w\u2032, this gives w\u2032 \u2208 Min\u2265Qa T . Choose u \u2208 T arbitrarily. We then have u \u2265Qa w\u2032 and, by definition, that Mina([u]Q \u2229 [u]a) \u2265a Mina([w \u2032]Q \u2229 [w\n\u2032]a). By choice of v we can then conclude {v} \u2264a Mina([w \u2032]Q \u2229 [w \u2032]a) \u2264a Mina([u]Q \u2229 [u]a) \u2264a {u}. As u was chosen arbitrarily in T , this shows v \u2208 Mina T . As v \u2208 [w \u2032]Q we have M,v \u2261 C M,w\u2032 and by assumption of M,w\u2032 |= \u03d5 that M,v |= \u03d5. We now have v \u2208 Mina(J\u03a8w \u2228\u03a8w\u2032KM \u2229 [w]a) and M,v |= \u03d5, completing the proof of the claim.\nWe now proceed to show that Q fulfils the conditions for being an autobisimulation on M (Definition 2). [atoms] is trivial. Next we show [forth\u2265]. Let (w,w \u2032) \u2208 Q (i.e. (M,w) \u2261C (M,w\u2032)) and w \u2265Qa v. We then have that [forth\u2265] is fulfilled if \u2203v \u2032 \u2208 W , s.t. w\u2032 \u2265Qa v\u2032 and (v, v\u2032) \u2208 Q (i.e. (M,v) \u2261C (M,v\u2032)). To this end, we show that assuming for all v\u2032 \u2208 W , w\u2032 \u2265Qa v\u2032 implies (M,v) 6\u2261C (M,v\u2032) leads to a contradiction. This is analogous to how Q is shown to be a bisimulation in standard Hennesey-Millner proofs.\nWe first show that \u2265Qa is image-finite. First recall that by assumption on plausibility models, \u2265a is (pre)image finite, that is, both \u2265a and \u2264a are image-finite. It follows that \u223ca = \u2265a \u222a \u2264a is image-finite as well. If a relation is image-finite, then so is any subset of the relation. Therefore, as \u2265Qa \u2286 \u223ca, \u2265 Q a must be image-finite. Hence the set of \u2265 Q a -successors of w\u2032, S = {v\u2032 | w\u2032 \u2265Qa v\u2032} = {v\u20321, . . . , v \u2032 n} is also finite. Having assumed that v and none of the v\u2032is are modally equivalent, we have that there exists a number of distinguishing formulae \u03d5v\n\u2032 i , one for each v\u2032i, such that M,v |= \u03d5 v\u2032i and M,v\u2032i 6|= \u03d5 v\u2032i . Therefore, M,v |= \u03d5v \u2032 1 \u2227\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2227\u03d5v \u2032 n .\nFor notational ease, let \u03d5 = \u03d5v \u2032 1 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 \u03d5v \u2032 n .\nWith M,v |= \u03d5, Claim 1 gives the existence of a formula \u03c8, such that ([w]Q\u222a[v]Q)\u2229[w]a = J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a and M,w |= B\u0302 \u03c8 a \u03d5. Due to modal equivalence of w and w\u2032, we must have M,w\u2032 |= B\u0302\u03c8a \u03d5. This we have iff \u2203u\u2032 \u2208 Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w \u2032]a), s.t. M,u\n\u2032 |= \u03d5. By construction of \u03d5, no world v\u2032i exists such that w \u2032 \u2265Qa v\u2032i and M,v \u2032 i |= \u03d5, so we must have u \u2032 > Q a w \u2032. As u\u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a, the definition of > Q a gives Mina([u \u2032]Q \u2229 [w \u2032]a) >a Mina([w \u2032]Q \u2229 [w \u2032]a), so we get \u2203w\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Mina([w \u2032]Q \u2229 [w \u2032]a) s.t. u \u2032 >a w \u2032\u2032. As u\u2032 \u2208 Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w \u2032]a), we must therefore have w\u2032\u2032 6\u2208 J\u03c8KM , and then also w \u2032 6\u2208 J\u03c8KM . But as M,w |= \u03c8, we get the sought after contradiction (we initially assumed (M,w) \u2261C (M,w\u2032)). We get [back\u2265] immediately from Q being an equivalence relation.\nNow we get to [forth\u2264]. Let (w,w \u2032) \u2208 Q and w \u2264Qa v. We have that [forth\u2264] is fulfilled if \u2203v\u2032 \u2208 W , s.t. w\u2032 \u2264Qa v\u2032 and (v, v\u2032) \u2208 Q.\nClaim 2. There exists a v\u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a satisfying (v, v \u2032) \u2208 Q.\nProof of Claim 2. Suppose not. Then v does not have a modally equivalent world in [w\u2032]a. Thus there must be some formula \u03d5 holding in v that holds nowhere in [w\u2032]a. Since v \u2208 [w]a (using Lemma 2), this implies that M,w |= K\u0302a\u03d5 and M,w\n\u2032 6|= K\u0302a\u03d5. However, this contradicts (w,w\u2032) \u2208 Q, concluding the proof of the claim.\nLet v\u2032 be chosen as guaranteed by Claim 2. It now suffices to show w\u2032 \u2264Qa v\u2032. From (v, v\u2032) \u2208 Q and v \u2265Qa w, [forth\u2265] gives a w \u2032\u2032 s.t. v\u2032 \u2265Qa w\u2032\u2032 and (w,w\u2032\u2032) \u2208 Q. From v\u2032 \u2265 Q a w\n\u2032\u2032 we get v\u2032 \u223ca w \u2032\u2032, using Lemma 2. Since v\u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a we further get w \u2032 \u223ca v \u2032 \u223ca w \u2032\u2032. Since (w,w\u2032\u2032) \u2208 Q and (w,w\u2032) \u2208 Q we also get (w\u2032, w\u2032\u2032) \u2208 Q. From w\u2032 \u223ca w \u2032\u2032 and (w\u2032, w\u2032\u2032) \u2208 Q Lemma 1 gives\nus w\u2032 \u2243Qa w\u2032\u2032. From this and v\u2032 \u2265 Q a w \u2032\u2032 we get v\u2032 \u2265Qa w\u2032 and hence w\u2032 \u2264 Q a v \u2032, as required. This concludes proof of [forth\u2264]. As for [back\u2265] getting to [back\u2264] is easy and left out.\nTheorem 1 (Bisimulation characterisation for LC) Let (M,w), (M \u2032, w\u2032) be plausibility models. Then:\n(M,w)\u2194(M \u2032, w\u2032) iff (M,w) \u2261C (M \u2032, w\u2032) \u22a3\nProof From Proposition 4 and Proposition 5.\nWe can now finally give the promised proof of Proposition 1.\nProof (of Proposition 1) First note that neither the semantics of LC nor the proofs of Proposition 4 and 5 rely on the existence of largest autobisimulations. Hence we can use these in proving the proposition. Given a plausibility model M = (W,\u2265, V ) we define a relation R by R = {(w, v) \u2208 W 2 | M,w \u2261C M,v}. Since modal equivalence implies bisimilarity (Theorem 5), R is a bisimulation relation (indeed, R is exactly the relation shown to be an autobisimulation in the proof of Proposition 5). Now we have to show that R is the largest autobisimulation. If it was not, there would exist an autobisimulation R\u2032 with R\u2032\u2212R 6= \u2205. By definition of R, R\u2032 would then contain at least one pair (w, v) with M,w 6\u2261C M,v. However, since bisimilarity implies modal equivalence (Proposition 4), this contradicts R\u2032 being an autobisimulation. Hence R must be the largest autobisimulation. It only remains to prove that R is an equivalence relation. However, this is trivial given its definition in terms of modal equivalence."}, {"heading": "4.2 Bisimulation correspondence for degrees of belief", "text": "We now show bisimulation characterisation results for the logic of degrees of belief LD. Let M = (W,\u2265, V ). Recalling Definition 7, for some world w \u2208 W , the set Min0a[w]a is the minimal worlds with respect to a in the \u223ca-equivalence class of w. For a given w and a, we refer to the generalised definition Minna [w]a as (belief) sphere n of w for a. The distinction between Minna and Mina is important to keep straight! The former Min\u2014used to give semantics of the Bna modality of L\nD\u2014is with respect to the relation a. The latter Min is with respect to \u2265a, used to give the semantics of L\nC . Dealing as we do in this section with LD, we first state some necessary observations about the properties of what we call beliefs spheres. When convenient we will simply say that v is in (belief) sphere n for a, understanding that this actually means v \u2208 Minna [v]a.\nIt follows easily from the definitions, that for any world w, sphere n for a is wholly contained within sphere n+ 1 for a, i.e. Minna [w]a \u2286 Min n+1 a [w]a.\nLemma 4 Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) be a plausibility model and consider w, v \u2208 W . If w \u223ca v and w 6\u2208 Minna [w]a, we have the following two properties:\n(i) If v \u2208 Minna [w]a, then w \u227ba v.\n(ii) If v \u2208 Minn+1a [w]a then w a v . \u22a3\nProof The truth of (i) easily comes from the definition of Minna . For (ii), we consider two exhaustive cases for v. Either v \u2208 Minn+1a [w]a \\Min n a [w]a in which case w a v follows from\na-minimality, since by assumption w \u2208 [w]a \\Min n a [w]a. Otherwise v \u2208 Min n a [w]a, and so\nfrom w 6\u2208 Minna [w]a and (i) it follows that w \u227ba v and hence also w a v.\nNow getting to the meat of this section, showing bisimulation correspondence for LD, we first show that bisimilar worlds belong to spheres of all the same degrees.\nLemma 5 If (M1, w1)\u2194(M2, w2) then for all n \u2208 N, w1 \u2208 Min n a [w1]a iff w2 \u2208 Min n a [w2]a.\nProof Assume (M1, w1)\u2194(M2, w2). By definition there exists an autobisimulation R on the disjoint union of M1 and M2 with (w1, w2) \u2208 R. Using Proposition 1, let Rmax denote the largest bisimulation on the disjoint union of M1 and M2 (so a=\u2265 Rmax a ). Then R \u2286 Rmax. We are going to show by contradiction that for any (w,w\u2032) \u2208 Rmax (which includes (w1, w2)) and n \u2208 N, w \u2208 Minna [w]a iff w \u2032 \u2208 Minna [w \u2032]a. Suppose that this does not hold. Then there must be some pair of worlds w and w\u2032 such that (w,w\u2032) \u2208 Rmax and either i) w \u2208 Min n a [w]a and w\u2032 6\u2208 Minna [w \u2032]a, or ii) w 6\u2208 Min n a [w]a and w \u2032 \u2208 Minna [w \u2032]a for some n. Let n be the smallest natural number for which we have either i) or ii). Because the cases are symmetrical, we deal only with i). Using the alternative definition Minna [w]a = E n a [w]a \u222a Min n\u22121 a [w]a we can deal with both n > 0 and n = 0 simultaneously. By assumption of the smallest n we have w 6\u2208 Minn\u22121a [w]a, since w \u2032 6\u2208 Minna [w \u2032]a implies w\u2032 6\u2208 Minka[w \u2032]a for all 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n (so we could otherwise have chosen a smaller n). Therefore w \u2208 Ena [w]a and w \u2032 6\u2208 Ena [w \u2032]a. Because w \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032] \\ Minna [w\n\u2032]a, we know that n is not the maximum degree, so there must be some world v\u2032 \u2208 Ena [w\n\u2032]a which by definition means that v\u2032 6\u2208 Minn\u22121a [w \u2032]a. With v \u2032 \u2208 Ena [w \u2032]a \u2286 Min n a [w \u2032]a and and w \u2032 6\u2208 Minna [w\n\u2032]a, Lemma 4 gives w\u2032 \u227ba v \u2032, i.e. w\u2032 a v \u2032 and v\u2032 6 a w\n\u2032. By [back\u2265] there is a v s.t. w a v and (v, v\u2032) \u2208 Rmax. Because v \u2032 6\u2208 Minn\u22121a [w \u2032]a we cannot have v \u2208 Min n\u22121 a [w]a, as we could then again have chosen a smaller n making either i) or ii) true. Thus v \u2208 [w]a \\Min n\u22121 a [w]a. As w \u2208 Minna [w]a, Lemma 4 gives v a w, so by [forth\u2265] there is a u \u2032 s.t. v\u2032 a u\n\u2032 and (w, u\u2032) \u2208 Rmax.\nWith (w,w\u2032) \u2208 Rmax and (w, u \u2032) \u2208 Rmax, we have (w \u2032, u\u2032) \u2208 Rmax. As w \u2032 \u223ca u \u2032 (we have w\u2032 a v \u2032 and v\u2032 a u \u2032), Lemma 1 gives w\u2032 \u2243Rmaxa u \u2032, i.e. w\u2032 a u \u2032 and w\u2032 a u\n\u2032. As w\u2032 6\u2208 Minna [w \u2032]a, we then have u \u2032 6\u2208 Minna [w \u2032]a. As u \u2032 6\u2208 Minna [w \u2032]a while v \u2032 \u2208 Ena [w \u2032]a \u2286 Min n a [w\n\u2032]a, Lemma 4 then gives u\u2032 \u227ba v \u2032. But this contradicts v\u2032 a u \u2032, concluding the proof.\nProposition 6 Bisimilarity implies modal equivalence for LD. \u22a3\nProof Assume (M1, w1)\u2194(M2, w2). Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) denote the disjoint union of M1 and M2. Then there exists an autobisimulation R on M with (w1, w2) \u2208 R. Using Proposition 1, let Rmax denote the largest autobisimulation on M . Then R \u2286 Rmax. We need to prove that (M,w1) \u2261\nD (M,w2). We will show that for all (w,w\u2032) \u2208 Rmax, for all \u03d5 \u2208 L\nD, M,w |= \u03d5 iff M,w\u2032 |= \u03d5 (which then also means that it holds for all (w,w\u2032) \u2208 R). We proceed by induction on the syntactic complexity of \u03d5. The propositional and knowledge cases are already covered by Proposition4, so we only go for \u03d5 = Bna\u03c8.\nAssume M,w |= Bna\u03c8. We need to prove that M,w \u2032 |= Bna\u03c8, that is M,v \u2032 |= \u03c8 for all v\u2032 \u2208 Minna [w \u2032]a. Picking an arbitrary v \u2032 \u2208 Minna [w \u2032]a, we have [w \u2032]a = [v\n\u2032]a from Lemma 2, and either w\u2032 a v \u2032 or w\u2032 a v \u2032 (so we also have v\u2032 \u2208 Minna [v\n\u2032]a). Using [back\u2265] or [back\u2264] as appropriate, we get that there is a v such that w a v or w a v, and (v, v\n\u2032) \u2208 Rmax. From this, v\u2032 \u2208 Minna [v \u2032]a, and Lemma 5 we get v \u2208 Min n a [v]a, allowing us to conclude v \u2208 Min n a [w]a from [w]a = [v]a. With the original assumption of M,w |= B n a\u03c8 we get M,v |= \u03c8. As (v, v\u2032) \u2208 Rmax, the induction hypothesis gives M,v \u2032 |= \u03c8. As v\u2032 was chosen arbitrarily in Minna [w \u2032]a this gives M,w \u2032 |= Bna\u03c8. Showing that M,w \u2032 |= Bna\u03c8 implies M,w |= B n a\u03c8 is completely symmetrical and therefore left out.\nWe now get to showing that modal equivalence for the language of degrees of belief implies bisimilarity. Trouble is, that the Bna modality uses the largest autobisimulation for deriving the relation a. This makes it difficult to go the Hennesey-Millner way of showing by contradiction that the modal equivalence relation Q is an autobisimulation.\nInstead, we establish that modal equivalence for LD implies modal equivalence for LC . We go about this by way of a model and world dependent translation of LC formulas into LD formulas (Definition 10). This translation has two properties. First, the translated formula is true at M,w iff the untranslated formula is (Lemma 7)\u2014a quite uncontroversial property. More precisely, letting M = (W,\u2265, R) be a plausibility model, then for any w \u2208 W , \u03b3 \u2208 LC where \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) is the translation at M,w: M,w |= \u03b3 \u21d4 M,w |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3). Assume further that we have some M \u2032, w\u2032 such that (M,w) \u2261D (M \u2032, w\u2032). As \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) is a formula of L\nD we can conclude M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3). So in all we get that\nM,w |= \u03b3 \u21d4 M,w |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) \u21d4 M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) (*)\nThe second property is that the translation of \u03b3 is the same for worlds modally equivalent for LD (Lemma 8): If (M,w) \u2261D (M \u2032, w\u2032) then \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) = \u03c3M \u2032,w\u2032(\u03b3). This then gives\nM \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) \u21d4 M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c3M \u2032,w\u2032(\u03b3) \u21d4 M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03b3 (**)\nCombining (*) and (**) gives that if (M,w) \u2261D (M \u2032, w\u2032) thenM,w |= \u03b3 iff M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03b3 for any \u03b3 \u2208 LC , i.e. that (M,w) \u2261C (M \u2032, w\u2032). As shown in the previous section, modal equivalence for LC implies bisimilarity (Proposition 5), and we can therefore finally conclude that modal equivalence for LD implies bisimilarity (Proposition7).\nLemma 6 For a plausibility model M , a world w \u2208 D(M), agent a \u2208 A and a formula \u03c8 of LC , if J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a 6= \u2205, there is a unique natural number k for which Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a) \u2286 Eka [w]a (= Min a([w]a \\Min k\u22121 a [w]a)).\nProof Let S = J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a. We first show that all worlds in Mina S are equiplausible with respect to a.\nTake any two worlds v1, v2 \u2208 Mina S. We wish to show v1 \u2243 R a v2, i.e. Mina([v1]R \u2229 [v1]a) \u2243a Mina([v2]R\u2229[v2]a), whereR is the largest autobisimulation onM . With Proposition4 (bisimilarity implies modal equivalence for LC) and for i = 1, 2, we have that [vi]R \u2286 J\u03c8KM . Hence [vi]R\u2229[vi]a = [vi]R\u2229[w]a \u2286 J\u03c8KM\u2229[w]a = S. With vi \u2208 Mina S and vi \u2208 [vi]R\u2229[vi]a \u2286 S, we have vi \u2208 Mina([vi]R \u2229 [vi]a) (if an element of a set A is minimal in a set B \u2287 A, then it is also minimal in A). From this we can conclude that Mina([vi]R \u2229 [vi]a) \u2243a {vi}. Since v1 \u2243a v2 we get Mina([v1]R \u2229 [v1]a) \u2243a {v1} \u2243a {v2} \u2243a Mina([v2]R \u2229 [v2]a), concluding the proof of v1 \u2243 R a v2.\nDue to (pre)image-finiteness ofM , [w]a is finite. This means that for any v \u2208 [w]a there is a unique natural number k for which v \u2208 Eka [w]a. As all worlds in Mina S are a-equiplausible, we have that Mina S \u2286 E k a [w]a for some unique k.\nHaving established that if J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a 6= \u2205 then there does indeed exist a unique k st. Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a) \u2286 E k a [w]a, we have that the following translation is well-defined.\nDefinition 10 (Translation \u03c3M,w) Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) be a plausibility model and \u03b3 \u2208 L C be given. We write \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) for the translation of \u03b3 at M,w into a formula of L D defined as follows:\n\u03c3M,w(p) = p\n\u03c3M,w(\u00ac\u03d5) = \u00ac\u03c3M,w(\u03d5)\n\u03c3M,w(\u03d51 \u2227 \u03d52) = \u03c3M,w(\u03d51) \u2227 \u03c3M,w(\u03d52)\n\u03c3M,w(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) =\n{ Bka \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) | v \u2208 [w]a} \u2227 B\u0302 k a \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a} if J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a 6= \u2205\nKa \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a} if J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a = \u2205\nwhere k is the natural number such that Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a) \u2286 E k a [w]a. As Ka\u03d5 is definable in LC as B\u00ac\u03d5a \u22a5, we need no Ka\u03d5-case in the translation. \u22a3\nWe need (pre)image-finiteness of M because the translation of \u03c3M,w(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) is based on\neither [w]a or Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a). For \u03c3M,w(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) to be finite, we need finiteness of [w]a.\nWe now get to showing the first of the promised properties of the translation, namely that the translated formula is true at M,w iff the untranslated formula is.\nLemma 7 Given a plausibility model M = (W,\u2265, V ) and \u03b3 \u2208 LC we have M,w |= \u03b3 iff M,w |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) for all w \u2208 W .\nProof We show both directions by induction on the modal depth of \u03b3. For the base case of a modal depth of 0, we have \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) = \u03b3 easily, giving M,w |= \u03b3 iff M,w |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3). The p-, \u00ac-, \u2227-cases being quite easy, we deal only with \u03b3 = B\u03c8a \u03d5 in the induction step. For that case there are to subcases; whether \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) is a Ka-formula or not.\n(\u21d2) : M,w |= \u03b3 implies M,w |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3).\nTake first the case J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a = \u2205 where \u03c3M,w(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) = Ka \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a}. If J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a = \u2205, then M,v |= \u00ac\u03c8 for all v \u2208 [w]a. Applying the induction hypothesis gives M,v |= \u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03c8) for all v \u2208 [w]a. Then we also have M,u |= \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a} for all\nu \u2208 [w]a and finally M,w |= Ka \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a}.\nNow take the case J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a 6= \u2205. Letting S = Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a) and k be chosen as in the translation, i.e. such that S \u2286 Eka [w]a, we wish to prove that M,w |= B \u03c8 a \u03d5\nimplies M,w |= Bka \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) | v \u2208 [w]a} \u2227 B\u0302 k a \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a}. We first show\nM,w |= B\u0302ka \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a}. Because M,v |= \u03c8 for all v \u2208 S, the induction hypothesis\ngives M,v |= \u03c3M,v(\u03c8) for all v \u2208 S. From this we can conclude M,u |= \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8) | v \u2208 S}\nfor all u \u2208 S, and thus also M,u |= \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a} for all u \u2208 S. From Lemma 6 we\nhave S \u2286 Minka[w]a, so M,u |= \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a} for some u \u2208 Min k a[w]a. This gives\nM,w |= B\u0302ka \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a}. Next is M,w |= B k a \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) | v \u2208 [w]a}.\nClaim. If M,w |= B\u03c8a \u03d5, then for all v \u2208 Eka [w]a \u2229 J\u03c8KM , M,v |= \u03d5.\nProof of claim. We show the claim by contradiction, assuming that at least one world in Eka [w]a \u2229 J\u03c8KM is a \u00ac\u03d5-world. Let v be this \u03c8 \u2227 \u00ac\u03d5-world. As v \u2208 E k a [w]a, we have {v} \u2243Rmaxa E k a [w]a \u2243 Rmax a S, and specifically that \u2200s \u2208 S : v \u2243 Rmax a s. This means \u2200s \u2208 S : Min([v]Rmax \u2229 [v]a) \u2243a Mina([s]Rmax \u2229 [s]a). Because \u2200s \u2208 S : Mina([s]Rmax \u2229 [s]a) \u2243a S, we have Min([v]Rmax \u2229 [v]a) \u2243a S and thus some v \u2032 \u2208 Min([v]Rmax \u2229 [v]a) such that {v \u2032} \u2243a S. Combining v\u2032 \u2208 [v]Rmax with Theorem 1 gives M,v \u2261 C M,v\u2032 and thus that M,v\u2032 |= \u03c8 \u2227 \u00ac\u03d5. Putting v\u2032 \u2208 J\u03c8KM together with {v \u2032} \u2243a S, means that v \u2032 \u2208 S. As M,v\u2032 |= \u00ac\u03d5, we have a contradiction of M,w |= B\u03c8a \u03d5, concluding the proof of the claim.\nWith M,w |= B\u03c8a \u03d5, we now have M,v |= \u03d5 for all v \u2208 Eka [w]a \u2229 J\u03c8KM , and thus M,v |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 for all v \u2208 Eka [w]a. Lemma 6 gives S \u2286 E k a [w]a, and by definition we have E k a [w]a \u2229 Mink\u22121a [w]a = \u2205, that is, there are no \u03c8-worlds below layer k, so M,v |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 for all v \u2208 Minka[w]a. Using the induction hypothesis gives M,v |= \u03c3M,v(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) for all v \u2208 Min k a[w]a\nand therefore M,w |= Bka \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) | v \u2208 [w]a}, finalising left-to-right direction of the proof.\n(\u21d0) : M,w |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) implies M,w |= \u03b3.\nWe show the stronger claim that M,w |= \u03c3M,w\u2032(\u03b3) for some w \u2032 \u2208 D(M) implies M,w |= \u03b3. Let \u03b3 = B\u03c8a \u03d5 and suppose that M,w |= \u03c3M,w\u2032(\u03b3) for some w \u2032 \u2208 D(M). We then need to\nshow M,w |= B\u03c8a \u03d5. First take the case where J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w \u2032]a = \u2205. Then \u03c3M,w\u2032(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) =\nKa \u2228 {\u03c3M,v\u2032(\u00ac\u03c8) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a}, i.e. M,w |= Ka \u2228 {\u03c3M,v\u2032(\u00ac\u03c8) | v\n\u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a}. This means that M,v |= \u2228 {\u03c3M,v\u2032(\u00ac\u03c8) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a} for all v \u2208 [w]a, i.e. for any v \u2208 [w]a there is a v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a such that M,v |= \u03c3M,v\u2032(\u00ac\u03c8). Applying the induction hypothesis, we get M,v |= \u00ac\u03c8 for all v \u2208 [w]a. Thus J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a = \u2205 and we trivially have M,w |= B \u03c8 a \u03d5.\nNow take the case J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w \u2032]a 6= \u2205. Letting S \u2032 = Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w \u2032]a) and k \u2032 be s.t. S\u2032 \u2286 Ek \u2032\na [w \u2032]a, we have M,w |= B\nk\u2032 a \u2228 {(\u03c3M,v\u2032(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a} \u2227 B\u0302 k\u2032 a \u2228 {\u03c3M,v\u2032(\u03c8) | v\n\u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a}. From M,w |= Bk \u2032\na\n\u2228 {\u03c3M,v\u2032(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a} we have M,v |= \u2228 {\u03c3M,v\u2032(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a}\nfor all v \u2208 Mink \u2032\na [w]a, i.e. for any v \u2208 [w]a there is a v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a such that M,v |= \u03c3M,v\u2032(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5).\nApplying the induction hypothesis, we get M,v |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 for all v \u2208 Mink \u2032\na [w]a. From M,w |= B\u0302k \u2032\na\n\u2228 {\u03c3M,v\u2032(\u03c8) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a} we have M,v |= \u2228 {\u03c3M,v\u2032(\u03c8) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a} for some\nv \u2208 Mink \u2032\na [w]a, i.e. there is a v \u2208 [w]a and a v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a such that M,v |= \u03c3M,v\u2032(\u03c8). Applying\nthe induction hypothesis gets us M,v |= \u03c8. Thus we have M,w |= Bk \u2032 a (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5)\u2227 B\u0302 k\u2032\na \u03c8 (where \u03c8,\u03d5 \u2208 LC).\nFrom M,w |= B\u0302k \u2032\na \u03c8 we have that J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a 6= \u2205, so Lemma 6 gives the existence of a k, s.t. Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a) \u2286 Min k a[w]a. We also have from M,w |= B\u0302 k\u2032 a \u03c8 that k \u2264 k \u2032, so Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a) \u2286 Min k\u2032 a [w]a. With M,w |= B k\u2032\na (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) we get M,v |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 for all v \u2208 Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a), then M,v |= \u03d5 for all v \u2208 Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a), and finally M,w |= B\u03c8a \u03d5.\nWe have now gotten to the second of the two promised properties; that the translation is the same for worlds modally equivalent for LD.\nLemma 8 Given plausibility models M and M \u2032, for any w \u2208 D(M) and w\u2032 \u2208 D(M \u2032), if (M,w) \u2261D (M \u2032, w\u2032) then for any formula \u03b3 \u2208 LC , \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) = \u03c3M \u2032,w\u2032(\u03b3).\nProof We show this by another induction on the modal depth of \u03b3. For the base case of modal depth 0 we trivially have \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) = \u03c3M \u2032,w\u2032(\u03b3).\nFor the induction step we, as before, only deal with \u03b3 = B\u03c8a \u03d5. Note first that every world in [w]a is modally equivalent to at least one world in [w\n\u2032]a. If that wasn\u2019t the case, there would be some formula LD-formula \u03d5 true somewhere in [w]a and nowhere in [w\n\u2032]a. Then M,w |= K\u0302a\u03d5 while M \u2032, w\u2032 6|= K\u0302a\u03d5, contradicting (M,w) \u2261 D (M \u2032, w\u2032). A completely analogous argument gives that every world in [w\u2032]a is modally equivalent to at least one world in [w]a. Thus J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a = \u2205 iff J\u03c8K \u2032 M \u2229 [w \u2032]a = \u2205. We thus have two cases, either both \u03c3M,w(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) and \u03c3M \u2032,w\u2032(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) are Ka-formulas, or both are B k a -formulas.\nWe deal first with the case where both translations are Ka-formulas. Here we have \u03c3M,w(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) = Ka \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03d5) | v \u2208 [w]a} and \u03c3M \u2032,w\u2032(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) = Ka \u2228 {\u03c3M \u2032,v\u2032(\u00ac\u03d5) | v\n\u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a}. As already shown, for all v \u2208 [w]a there is a v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a such that (M,w) \u2261 D (M \u2032, v\u2032), and vice versa. The induction hypothesis gives \u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03d5) = \u03c3M \u2032,v\u2032(\u00ac\u03d5) for all these vs and v \u2032s. Then\u2228\n{\u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03d5) | v \u2208 [w]a} = \u2228 {\u03c3M \u2032,v\u2032(\u00ac\u03d5) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a} and thus \u03c3M,w(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) = \u03c3M \u2032,w\u2032(B \u03c8 a \u03d5).\nTake now the case where both translations are Bka -formulas. A similar argument as above gives \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) | v \u2208 [w]a} = \u2228 {\u03c3M \u2032,v\u2032(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a} and \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u03c8) | v \u2208\n[w]a} = \u2228 {\u03c3M \u2032,v\u2032(\u03c8) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a}. Letting k and k \u2032 be the indices chosen in the translation of \u03c3M,w(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) and \u03c3M \u2032,w\u2032(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) respectively, we have \u03c3M,w(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) = \u03c3M \u2032,w\u2032(B \u03c8 a \u03d5) if k = k\u2032. Assume towards a contradiction that k > k\u2032. Lemma 6 now gives Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a) \u2229 Mink \u2032\na [w]a = \u2205, soM,v |= \u00ac\u03c8 for all v \u2208 Min k\u2032\na [w]a. With Lemma 7 we have M,v |= \u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03c8) for all v \u2208 Mink \u2032\na [w]a and thus also that M,w |= B k\u2032 a \u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a}. From Lemma\n6 we also have Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w \u2032]a) \u2286 Min\nk\u2032 a [w \u2032]a, so M \u2032, v\u2032 6|= \u00ac\u03c8 for some v\u2032 \u2208 Mink \u2032 a [w \u2032]a.\nFrom here we use Lemma 7 to conclude M \u2032, v\u2032 6|= \u03c3M \u2032,v\u2032(\u00ac\u03c8) for some v \u2032 \u2208 Mink\n\u2032\na [w \u2032]a and\nthus M \u2032, w\u2032 6|= Bk \u2032\na\n\u2228 {\u03c3M \u2032,v\u2032(\u00ac\u03c8) | v \u2032 \u2208 [w\u2032]a}. By the work done so far, this also means\nM \u2032, w\u2032 6|= Bk \u2032\na\n\u2228 {\u03c3M,v(\u00ac\u03c8) | v \u2208 [w]a} which contradicts (M,w) \u2261\nD (M \u2032, w\u2032). The case when k\u2032 > k is completely symmetrical, and the proof if thus concluded.\nProposition 7 Modal equivalence for LD implies bisimilarity. \u22a3\nProof Let M = (W,\u2265, V ) and M \u2032 = (W \u2032,\u2265\u2032, V \u2032) be two plausibility models. We first show that if (M,w) \u2261D (M \u2032, w\u2032) then (M,w) \u2261C (M \u2032, w\u2032). Assume (M,w) \u2261D (M \u2032, w,\u2032 ) and let \u03b3 be any formula of LC .\nM,w |= \u03b3 \u21d4 M,w |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) (Lemma 7)\n\u21d4 M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c3M,w(\u03b3) (by assumption) \u21d4 M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c3M \u2032,w\u2032(\u03b3) (Lemma 8) \u21d4 M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03b3 (Lemma 7)\nPutting this together with Theorem 5 (modal equivalence for LC implies bisimilarity), we have that two worlds which are modally equivalent in LD are also modally equivalent in LC and therefore bisimilar.\nTheorem 2 (Bisimulation characterisation for LD) Let (M,w), (M \u2032, w\u2032) be plausibility models. Then:\n(M,w)\u2194(M \u2032, w\u2032) iff (M,w) \u2261D (M \u2032, w\u2032) \u22a3\nProof From Proposition 6 and Proposition 7."}, {"heading": "4.3 Bisimulation correspondence for safe belief", "text": "We now show bisimulation characterisation results for the logic of degrees of belief LS .\nProposition 8 Bisimilarity implies modal equivalence for LS . \u22a3\nProof AssumeM1\u2194M2. Then there is an autobisimulation R \u2032 on the disjoint union M1\u2294M2 with R\u2032 \u2229 (D(M1)\u00d7D(M2)) 6= \u2205. Extend R\u2032 into the largest autobisimulation R on M1 \u2294M2 (using Proposition 1). Define R1 = R \u2229 (D(M1)\u00d7D(M1)) and R2 = R \u2229 (D(M2)\u00d7D(M2)).\nClaim. Let i \u2208 {1, 2} and w \u2208 D(Mi). Then\n(i) Ri is the largest autobisimulation on Mi.\n(ii) Mina([w]R= \u2229 [w]a) = Mina([w]R= i \u2229 [w]a).\n(iii) For any v, w \u2265Ra v iff w \u2265 Ri a v.\nProof of claim. To prove (i), let Si denote the largest autobisimulation on Mi. If we can show Si \u2286 Ri we are done. Since Si is an autobisimulation on Mi, it must also be an autobisimulation on M1 \u2294M2. Thus, clearly, Si \u2286 R, since R is the largest autobisimulation on M1 \u2294 M2. Hence, since Si \u2286 D(Mi) \u00d7 D(Mi), we get Si = Si \u2229 (D(Mi) \u00d7 D(Mi)) \u2286 R \u2229 (D(Mi)\u00d7D(Mi)) = Ri. This shows Si \u2286 Ri, as required.\nWe now prove (ii). Since w \u2208 D(Mi) we get [w]a \u2286 D(Mi). Since Ri = R \u2229 (D(Mi) \u00d7 D(Mi)) this implies [w]R \u2229 [w]a = [w]Ri \u2229 [w]a. Now note that since R is the largest autobisimulation on M1 \u2294M2 and Ri is the largest autobisimulation on Mi, we have R = R\n= and Ri = R = i , by Proposition 1 (the largest autobisimulation is an equivalence relation). Hence\nfrom [w]R \u2229 [w]a = [w]Ri \u2229 [w]a we can conclude [w]R= \u2229 [w]a = [w]R=i \u2229 [w]a, and then finally Mina([w]R= \u2229 [w]a) = Mina([w]R=i \u2229 [w]a).\nWe now prove (iii). Note that if w \u2265Ra v or w \u2265 Ri a then w \u223ca v (by Lemma 2). So in proving w \u2265Ra v \u21d4 w \u2265 Ri a v for w \u2208 D(Mi), we can assume that also v \u2208 D(Mi). We then get:\nw \u2265Ra v \u21d4 Mina([w]R= \u2229 [w]a) \u2265a Mina([v]R= \u2229 [v]a) \u21d4 Mina([w]R=i \u2229 [w]a) \u2265a Mina([v]R=i \u2229 [v]a) by (ii), since w, v \u2208 D(Mi) \u21d4 w \u2265Ria v.\nThis completes the proof of the claim.\nWe will now show that for all \u03d5 and all (w1, w2) \u2208 R \u2229 (D(M1) \u00d7 D(M2)), if M1, w1 |= \u03d5 then M2, w2 |= \u03d5 (the other direction being symmetric). The proof is by induction on the syntactic complexity of \u03d5. The propositional and knowledge cases are already covered by Proposition 4, so we only need to consider the case \u03d5 = a\u03c8. Hence assume M1, w1 |= a\u03c8 and (w1, w2) \u2208 R \u2229 (D(M1) \u00d7D(M2)). We need to prove M2, w2 |= a\u03c8. Pick an arbitrary v2 \u2208 D(M2) with w2 a v2. If we can show M2, v2 |= \u03c8, we are done. By (i), R2 is the largest autobisimulation on M2. Hence w2 a v2 by definition means w2 \u2265 R2 a v2. Using (iii), we can from w2 \u2265 R2 a v2 conclude w2 \u2265 R a v2. Since R is an autobisimulation, we can now apply [back\u2265] to (w1, w2) \u2208 R and w2 \u2265 R a v2 to get a v1 with w1 \u2265 R a v1 and (v1, v2) \u2208 R. Using (iii) again we can conclude from w1 \u2265 R a v1 to w1 \u2265 R1 a v1, since w1 \u2208 D(M1). By (i), R1 is the largest autobisimulation on M1, so w1 \u2265 R1 a v1 is by definition the same as w1 a v1. Since we have assumed M1, w1 |= a\u03c8, and since w1 a v1, we get M1, v1 |= \u03c8. Since (v1, v2) \u2208 R, the induction hypothesis gives us M2, v2 |= \u03c8, and we are done.\nAs for the previous logics, the converse also holds, that is, modal equivalence with regard to LS implies bisimulation. This is going to be proved as follows. First we prove that any conditional belief formula \u03d5C can be translated into a logically equivalent safe belief formula \u03d5S . This implies that if two pointed models (M,w) and (M\n\u2032, w\u2032) are modally equivalent in LS , they must also be modally equivalent in LC : Any formula \u03d5C \u2208 L\nC is true in (M,w) iff its translation \u03d5S \u2208 L S is true in (M,w) iff \u03d5S is true in (M \u2032, w\u2032) iff \u03d5C is true in (M\n\u2032, w\u2032). Now we can reason as follows: If two pointed models (M,w) and (M \u2032, w\u2032) are modally equivalent in LS then they are modally equivalent in LC and hence, by Theorem 5, bisimilar. This is the result we were after. We postpone the full proof until Section 5.1, which is where we provide the translation of conditional belief formulas into safe belief formulas (as part of a systematic investigation of the relations between the different languages and their relative expressivity). Here we only state the result:\nProposition 9 Modal equivalence for LS implies bisimilarity. \u22a3\nProof See Section 5.1.\nAs for the two previous languages, LC and LD, we now get the following bisimulation characterisation result.\nTheorem 3 (Bisimulation characterisation for LS) Let (M,w), (M \u2032, w\u2032) be plausibility models. Then:\n(M,w)\u2194(M \u2032, w\u2032) iff (M,w) \u2261S (M \u2032, w\u2032) \u22a3\nProof From Proposition 8 and Proposition 9."}, {"heading": "4.4 Combining characterisation results", "text": "By combining Theorems 4, 6 and 8 from the previous subsections we immediately have the following result.\nCorollary 1 Bisimilarity corresponds to modal equivalence in the logics of conditional belief, degrees of belief, and safe belief, and in any logic containing two or all three of these belief modalities; and modal equivalence in one of these logics corresponds to modal equivalence in any other. \u22a3\nFor example, we also have that (M,w)\u2194(M \u2032, w\u2032) iff (M,w) \u2261CDS (M \u2032, w\u2032), or that (M,w)\u2194(M \u2032, w\u2032) iff (M,w) \u2261DS (M \u2032, w\u2032). Also, to be explicit, we now have that\n\u2022 (M,w) \u2261C (M \u2032, w\u2032) iff (M,w) \u2261D (M \u2032, w\u2032)\n\u2022 (M,w) \u2261C (M \u2032, w\u2032) iff (M,w) \u2261S (M \u2032, w\u2032)\n\u2022 (M,w) \u2261D (M \u2032, w\u2032) iff (M,w) \u2261S (M \u2032, w\u2032)\nIn other words, the information content of a pointed plausibility model is equally well described in any of these logics. This seems to suggest that it does not matter which logic you use to describe the information content of such a model, apart from the usual considerations of succinctness. Still, this is not the case: our logics are not equally expressive. This will now be addressed in the next section."}, {"heading": "5 Expressivity", "text": "In this section we will determine the expressivity hierarchy of the logics under consideration. Abstractly speaking, expressivity is a yardstick for measuring whether two logics are able to capture the same properties of a class of models. More concretely in our case, we will for instance be interested in determining whether the conditional belief modality can be expressed using the degrees of belief modality (observe that the translation in Section 4.2 depends on a particular model). With such results at hand we can for instance justify the inclusion or exclusion of a modality, and it also sheds light upon the strengths and weaknesses of our doxastic notions. To start things off we now formally introduce the notion of expressivity found in [38].\nDefinition 11 Let L and L\u2032 be two logical languages interpreted on the same class of models.\n\u2022 For \u03d5 \u2208 L and \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 L\u2032, we say that \u03d5 and \u03d5\u2032 are equivalent (\u03d5 \u2261 \u03d5\u2032) iff they are true in the same pointed models of said class.3\n\u2022 L\u2032 is at least as expressive as L (L \u2266 L\u2032) iff for every \u03d5 \u2208 L there is a \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 L\u2032 s.t. \u03d5 \u2261 \u03d5\u2032.\n\u2022 L and L\u2032 are equally expressive (L \u2261 L\u2032) iff L \u2266 L\u2032 and L\u2032 \u2266 L.\n\u2022 L\u2032 is more expressive than L (L < L\u2032) iff L \u2266 L\u2032 and L\u2032 6\u2266 L.\n\u2022 L and L\u2032 are incomparable (L \u22b2\u22b3 L\u2032) iff L 6\u2266 L\u2032 and L\u2032 6\u2266 L. \u22a3\n3With our usage of \u2261 it is clear from context whether we\u2019re referring to modal equivalence, formulas or languages.\nBelow we will show several cases where L 6\u2266 L\u2032; i.e. that L\u2032 is not at least as expressive as L. Our primary modus operandi (obtained by logically negating L \u2266 L\u2032) will be to show that there is a \u03d5 \u2208 L, where for any \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 L\u2032 we can find two pointed models (M,w), (M \u2032, w\u2032) such that\nM,w |= \u03d5, M \u2032, w\u2032 6|= \u03d5 and (M,w |= \u03d5\u2032 \u21d4 M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03d5\u2032)\nIn other words, for some \u03d5 \u2208 L, no matter the choice of \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 L\u2032, there will be models which \u03d5 distinguishes but \u03d5\u2032 does not, meaning that \u03d5 6\u2261 \u03d5\u2032.\nOur investigation will be concerned with the 7 distinct languages that are obtained by considering each LX such that X is a non-empty subsequence of CDS. In Section 5.1 our focus is on safe belief, and in Section 5.2 on degrees of belief. Using these results, we provide in Section 5.3 a full picture of the relative expressivity of each of these logics, for instance showing that we can formulate 5 distinct languages up to equal expressivity. We find this particularly remarkable in light of the fact that our notion of bisimulation is the right fit for all our logics."}, {"heading": "5.1 Expressivity of Safe Belief", "text": "Our first result relates to expressing conditional belief in terms of safe belief. Similar results can be found elsewhere in the literature, for instance in [12, Fact 31] and [7] where it is stated without proof. Below we prove that the identity found in [12] is also a valid identity in our logics, which is not a given as our semantics differ in essential ways. In particular the semantics of safe belief in [12] is a standard modality for \u2265a, whereas our semantics uses the derived relation a. A more in-depth account of this matter is provided in Section 6. Returning to the matter at hand, we point out that our work in Section 4 actually serves our investigations here, as evident from the crucial role of Corollary 1 in the following proof.\nProposition 10 The formula B\u03c8a \u03d5 \u2194 (K\u0302a\u03c8 \u2192 K\u0302a(\u03c8 \u2227 a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5))) is valid.\nProof We let M = (W,\u2265, V ) be any plausibility model with w \u2208 W , and further let a denote the normal plausibility relation for an agent a in M . We will show that M,w |= B \u03c8 a \u03d5 \u2194 (K\u0302a\u03c8 \u2192 K\u0302a(\u03c8 \u2227 a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5))). To this end we let X = Mina(J\u03c8KM \u2229 [w]a). Immediately we have that if X = \u2205 then no world in [w]a satisfies \u03c8, thus trivially yielding both M,w |= B\u03c8a \u03d5 and M,w |= K\u0302a\u03c8 \u2192 K\u0302a(\u03c8 \u2227 a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5)). For the remainder we therefore assume X is non-empty. We now work under the assumption that M,w |= B\u03c8a \u03d5 and show that this implies M,w |= K\u0302a\u03c8 \u2192 K\u0302a(\u03c8 \u2227 a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5)).\nClaim 1. Let x \u2208 X be arbitrarily chosen, then M,x |= \u03c8 \u2227 a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5).\nProof of claim 1. From x \u2208 X we have first that M,x |= \u03c8 \u2227 \u03d5 and w \u223ca x. Since M,x |= \u03c8 this means we have proven Claim 1 if M,x |= a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) can be shown. To that effect, consider any y \u2208 W s.t. x a y, for which we must prove M,y |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5. When M,y 6|= \u03c8 this is immediate, and so we may assume M,y |= \u03c8. Since x a y we have Mina([x]R= \u2229 [x]a) \u2265a Mina([y]R= \u2229 [y]a) with R being the largest autobisimulation on M . As R is an autobisimulation we have worlds x\u2032, y\u2032 in M such that (y, y\u2032) \u2208 R, x \u2265a x\n\u2032 and x\u2032 \u2265a y\n\u2032. Applying Corollary 1 and M,y |= \u03c8 it follows that M,y\u2032 |= \u03c8. Using \u2265a-transitivity we have x \u2265a y \u2032 and hence w \u223ca x \u223ca y \u2032, allowing the conclusion that y\u2032 \u2208 X. By assumption this meansM,y\u2032 |= \u03c8\u2227\u03d5, and so applying once more Corollary 1 it follows thatM,y |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 thus completing the proof of this claim.\nTo show M,w |= K\u0302a\u03c8 \u2192 K\u0302a(\u03c8 \u2227 a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5)) we take any x \u2208 X, for which we have w \u223ca x by definition of X. Combining this with Claim 1 it follows that M,w |= K\u0302a(\u03c8\u2227 a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5)).\nConsequently this also means that M,w |= K\u0302a\u03c8 \u2192 K\u0302a(\u03c8 \u2227 a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5)), thus completing the proof of this direction.\nFor the converse assume now that M,w |= K\u0302a\u03c8 \u2192 K\u0302a(\u03c8 \u2227 a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5)). As X 6= \u2205 there is a world u \u2208 W s.t. w \u223ca u and M,u |= \u03c8 \u2227 a(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5). Therefore we have M,u\n\u2032 |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 for all u a u \u2032.\nClaim 2. Let x \u2208 X be arbitrarily chosen, then M,x |= \u03d5.\nProof of claim 2. Since x \u2208 X we have by definition that M,x |= \u03c8. It is sufficient to prove that u a x because this implies M,x |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 and hence M,x |= \u03d5 as required. To show u a x we assume towards a contradiction that u 6 a x. Now let R denote the largest bisimulation on M and consider any x\u2032 \u2208 Mina([x]R= \u2229 [x]a). As R\n= and \u223ca are both reflexive, we have x \u2265a x \u2032. From u 6 a x we therefore have a u \u2032 \u2208 Mina([u]R= \u2229 [u]a) s.t. u\u2032 6\u2265a x \u2032, u \u223ca u \u2032 and (u, u\u2032) \u2208 R (thus also x\u2032 >a u \u2032). Since u\u2032 \u223ca u and u \u223ca w we have also u\u2032 \u223ca w, and additionally from x \u2265a x \u2032 and x\u2032 >a u \u2032 we can conclude that x \u2265a u \u2032 and u\u2032 6\u2265a x. Using M,u |= \u03c8 and (u, u \u2032) \u2208 R we apply Corollary 1 which implies M,u\u2032 |= \u03c8. As x \u2208 X, u\u2032 \u223ca w and x \u2265a u \u2032 it must be the case that u\u2032 \u2208 X. From u\u2032 6\u2265a x we also have that x 6\u2208 X, but this this contradicts our initial assumption that x \u2208 X. We therefore have u a x and hence that M,x |= \u03d5 which completes the proof of the claim.\nRecalling that M,w |= B\u03c8a \u03d5 iff M,x |= \u03d5 for all x \u2208 X, Claim 2 readily shows this direction, and thereby completes the proof.\nThis result shows there is an equivalence-preserving translation from formulas in LC to formulas in LS, and so we have the following results.\nCorollary 2 For any \u03d5 \u2208 LC there is a formula \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 LS s.t. \u03d5 \u2261 \u03d5\u2032. \u22a3\nCorollary 3 LC \u2266 LS , LS \u2261 LCS and LDS \u2261 LCDS. \u22a3\nFrom Corollary 3 we have that any expressivity result for LS also holds for LCS , and similarly for LDS and LCDS. In other words, the conditional belief modality is superfluous in terms of expressivity when the safe belief modality is at our disposal. What is more, we can now finally give a full proof of Proposition 9.\nProof (of Proposition 9) Let (M,w) and (M \u2032, w\u2032) be plausibility models which are modally equivalent in LS . For any \u03d5C \u2208 L C it follows from Corollary 2 that there is a \u03d5S \u2208 L S s.t. \u03d5C \u2261 \u03d5S . Therefore\nM,w |= \u03d5C \u21d4 M,w |= \u03d5S \u2261S \u21d0=\u21d2 M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03d5S \u21d4 M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03d5C\nand hence (M,w) \u2261C (M \u2032, w\u2032). Using Theorem 5 we can conclude (M,w)\u2194(M \u2032, w\u2032) as required.\nWe now proceed to show that LCD is not at least as expressive as LS . In doing so we need only work with A = {a}, meaning that the result holds even in the single-agent case. This is also true for our results in Section 5.2.\nLemma 9 Let p, q be two distinct symbols in P , and let M = (W,\u2265, V ) and M \u2032 = (W \u2032,\u2265\u2032 , V \u2032) denote the two plausibility models presented in Figure 5. Then for P \u2032 = P \\{q} we have that (M,w3) \u2261 CD P \u2032 (M \u2032, w\u20323).\nProof We prove the stronger result that for any \u03d5 \u2208 LCDP \u2032 :\nfor each i \u2208 {1, 2, 3} : (M,wi |= \u03d5) \u21d4 (M \u2032, w\u2032i |= \u03d5)\nWe proceed by induction on \u03d5 and let i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. When \u03d5 is a propositional symbol r in P \u2032, we have that r 6= q and so r \u2208 V (wi) iff r \u2208 V\n\u2032(w\u2032i), thus completing the base case. Negation and conjunction are readily shown using the induction hypothesis.\nFor \u03d5 = Ka\u03c8 we have that M,wi |= Ka\u03c8 iff M,v |= \u03c8 for all v \u2208 {w1, w2, w3}, since [wi]a = {w1, w2, w3}. Applying the induction hypothesis to each element this is equivalent to M \u2032, v\u2032 |= \u03c8 for all v\u2032 \u2208 {w\u20321, w \u2032 2, w \u2032 3} iff M \u2032, w\u2032i |= Ka\u03c8 (as [w \u2032 i]a = {w \u2032 1, w \u2032 2, w \u2032 3}), which completes this case. Continuing to consider \u03d5 = B\u03b3a\u03c8 we can simplify notation slightly, namely Mina(J\u03b3KM \u2229 [wi]a) = MinaJ\u03b3KM since [wi]a = W . The same holds for each world w \u2032 i of M \u2032.\nClaim 1. For M and M \u2032 we have that wi \u2208 MinaJ\u03b3KM iff w \u2032 i \u2208 MinaJ\u03b3KM \u2032 .\nProof of Claim 1. For M we have that w3 >a w2 and w2 >a w1, and similarly w \u2032 3 > \u2032 a w \u2032 2 and w\u20322 > \u2032 a w \u2032 1 for M \u2032. Thus the claim follows from the argument below.\nwi \u2208 MinaJ\u03b3KM \u21d4\nM,wi |= \u03b3 and there is no j <a i s.t. M,wj |= \u03b3 (IH) \u21d0=\u21d2\nM \u2032, w\u2032i |= \u03b3 and there is no j <a i s.t. M \u2032, w\u2032j |= \u03b3 \u21d4\nw\u2032i \u2208 MinaJ\u03b3KM \u2032\nWe now have that M,wi |= B \u03b3 a\u03c8 iff M,v |= \u03c8 for all v \u2208 MinaJ\u03b3KM . Applying both the induction hypothesis and Claim 1, we have that this is equivalent to M,v\u2032 |= \u03c8 for all v\u2032 \u2208 MinaJ\u03b3KM \u2032 iff M \u2032, w\u2032i |= B \u03b3 a\u03c8.\nFinally we consider the case of \u03d5 = Bna\u03c8. To this end we note that the union of {(w \u2032 1, w \u2032 3)} and the identity relation on W is the largest bisimulation on M \u2032 (this relation cannot be extended and still satify [atoms]). As w\u20321 and w \u2032 3 are bisimilar, it follows from Corollary 1 that M \u2032, w\u20321 |= \u03c8 iff M \u2032, w\u20323 |= \u03c8 (\u2217). Claim 2. For n \u2208 N we have that M,w |= \u03c8 for all w \u2208 Minna [wi] iff M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c8 for all w\u2032 \u2208 Minna [w \u2032 i].\nProof of Claim 2. We treat three exhaustive cases for n.\n\u2022 n = 0: M,w |= \u03c8 for all w \u2208 Min0a[wi] \u21d4 M,w1 |= \u03c8 (IH) \u21d0=\u21d2 M \u2032, w\u20321 |= \u03c8 (\u2217) \u21d0\u21d2 M \u2032, w\u20323 |= \u03c8.\nTherefore M,w |= \u03c8 for all w \u2208 Min0a[wi] is equivalent to M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c8 for all w\u2032 \u2208 {w\u20321, w \u2032 3}, and as Min 0 a[w \u2032 i] = {w \u2032 1, w \u2032 3} this concludes this case.\n\u2022 n = 1: Since Min1a[wi] = {w1, w2} we have that M,w |= \u03c8 for all w \u2208 {w1, w2} (IH) \u21d0=\u21d2\nM \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c8 for all w\u2032 \u2208 {w\u20321, w \u2032 2}. Using (\u2217) this is equivalent to M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c8 for all w\u2032 \u2208 {w\u20321, w \u2032 2, w \u2032 3}. By this argument and the fact that Min 1 a[w \u2032 i] = {w \u2032 1, w \u2032 2, w \u2032 3}, we can conclude M,w |= \u03c8 for all w \u2208 Min1a[wi] \u21d4 M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c8 for all w\u2032 \u2208 Min1a[w \u2032 i] as required.\n\u2022 n \u2265 2: We have that Minma [wi] = {w1, w2, w3} and Min m a [w \u2032 i] = {w \u2032 1, w \u2032 2, w \u2032 3}, hence this\nis exactly as the case of \u03d5 = K\u03c8. \u22a3\nWe have that M,wi |= B n a\u03c8 iff M,w |= \u03c8 for all w \u2208 Min n a [wi]. Applying Claim 2 this\nis equivalent to M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c8 for all w\u2032 \u2208 Minna [w \u2032 i] iff M \u2032, w\u2032i |= B n a\u03c8, thereby completing the final case of the induction step. It follows that (M,w3) \u2261 CD P \u2032 (M \u2032, w\u20323) as required.\nProposition 11 LS 6\u2266 LCD.\nProof Consider the formula \u2666ap of L S with p \u2208 P , and take some arbitrary formula \u03d5CD \u2208 LCDP . As \u03d5CD is finite and P is countably infinite, there will be some q 6= p not occurring in \u03d5CD. Letting P \u2032 = P \\ {q} this means that \u03d5CD \u2208 L CD P \u2032 . This choice of p and q can always be made, and consequently there also exists models M and M \u2032 as given in Figure 5. The largest bisimulation on M is the identity as no two worlds have the same valuation. At the same time {(w\u20321, w \u2032 1), (w \u2032 1, w \u2032 3), (w \u2032 2, w \u2032 2), (w \u2032 3, w \u2032 1), (w \u2032 3, w \u2032 3)} is the largest bisimulation on M\n\u2032. This gives rise to the normal plausibility relations a (for M) and \u2032 a (for M\n\u2032) depicted in Figure 5 using dashed edges.\nSince w3 a w2 and M,w2 |= p it follows that M,w3 |= \u2666ap. Furthermore we have that the image of w\u20323 under \u2032 a is {w \u2032 1, w \u2032 3}. This means that there is no v \u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 s.t. w\u20323 \u2032 a v\n\u2032 and M \u2032, v\u2032 |= p, and consequently M \u2032, w\u20323 6|= \u2666ap. At the same time we have by Lemma 9 that M,w3 |= \u03d5CD iff M \u2032, w\u20323 |= \u03d5CD. Therefore using the formula \u2666ap of L S, for any formula of \u03d5CD \u2208 L CD there are models which \u2666ap distinguishes but \u03d5CD does not, and so \u2666ap 6\u2261 \u03d5CD. Consequently we have LS 6\u2266 LCD as required.\nTo further elaborate on this result, what is really being put to use here is the ability of the safe belief modality to (at least in part) talk about propositional symbols that do not occur in a formula. This is an effect of the derived relation a depending on the largest bisimulation."}, {"heading": "5.2 Expressivity of Degrees of Belief", "text": "We have now settled that safe belief is more expressive than conditional belief, and further that the combination of the conditional belief modality and the degrees of belief modality does not allow us to express the safe belief modality. A hasty conclusion would be that the safe belief modality is the one modality to rule them all, but this is not so. In fact LS (equivalent to LCS cf. Corollary 3) falls short when it comes to expressing degrees of belief, which we now continue to prove.\nLemma 10 Let p, q be two distinct symbols in P , and let M = (W,\u2265, V ) and M \u2032 = (W \u2032,\u2265\u2032 , V \u2032) denote the two plausibility models presented in Figure 6. Then for P \u2032 = P \\{q} we have that (M,x1) \u2261 S P \u2032 (M \u2032, x\u2032).\nProof We will show the following stronger version of this lemma: For i \u2208 {1, 2} : (M,xi) \u2261 S P \u2032 (M \u2032, x\u2032) and (M,y) \u2261SP \u2032 (M \u2032, y\u2032). We proceed by induction on \u03d5 \u2208 LSP \u2032 , showing that:\nfor i \u2208 {1, 2} : M,xi |= \u03d5 iff M \u2032, x\u2032 |= \u03d5 and M,y |= \u03d5 iff M \u2032, y\u2032 |= \u03d5 (1)\nFor the base case we have \u03d5 = r for some r \u2208 P \\{q}. Because r 6= q it is clear that r \u2208 V (x1) iff r \u2208 V \u2032(x\u2032). Since we also have V (x2) = V\n\u2032(x\u2032) and V \u2032(y) = V (y\u2032) this completes the base case. The cases of negation and conjunction are readily established using the induction hypothesis, and \u03d5 = Ka\u03c8 is shown just as we did in the proof of Lemma 9. Before proceeding we recall that A = {a} and note that for any w \u2208 W we have [w]a = {x1, x2, y}, as well as [w\u2032]a = {x\n\u2032, y\u2032} for any w\u2032 \u2208 W \u2032. Moreover, the largest bisimulation on M and M \u2032 respectively is the identity relation, meaning that \u2265a= a and \u2265 \u2032 a= \u2032 a. For the case of \u03d5 = a\u03c8 we can therefore argue as follows.\nM,x1 |= a\u03c8 \u21d4 M,x1 |= \u03c8 (IH) \u21d0=\u21d2 M \u2032, x\u2032 |= \u03c8 \u21d4 M \u2032, x\u2032 |= a\u03c8\nM,x2 |= a\u03c8 \u21d4 (\u2200i \u2208 {1, 2} : M,xi |= \u03c8) (IH) \u21d0=\u21d2 M \u2032, x\u2032 |= \u03c8 \u21d4 M \u2032, x\u2032 |= a\u03c8\nM, y |= a\u03c8 \u21d4 (\u2200w \u2208 W : M,w |= \u03c8) (IH) \u21d0=\u21d2 (\u2200w\u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 : M \u2032, w\u2032 |= \u03c8) \u21d4 M \u2032, y\u2032 |= a\u03c8\nIn fact the last line is essentially the case of Ka\u03c8, as the image of y under a is W (and W \u2032 is the image of y\u2032 under \u2032a). This concludes our proof by induction, shows (1) and allows us to conclude that (M,x1) \u2261 S P \u2032 (M \u2032, x\u2032).\nProposition 12 LD 6\u2266 LS .\nProof Consider the formula B1ap \u2208 L D with p \u2208 P , and additionally take any formula \u03d5S \u2208 L S P . As \u03d5S is finite and P is countably infinite, there will be some q 6= p which does not occur in \u03d5S . With P \u2032 = P \\ {q} we therefore have \u03d5S \u2208 L S P \u2032 . As we can always make such a choice of p and q, this means that there always exists models (M,x1), (M \u2032, x\u2032) of the form given in Figure 6. As in the proof of Lemma 10 the largest bisimulation on M and M \u2032 is the identity and so Min1a[x1]a = {x1, x2} and Min 1 a[x \u2032]a = {x \u2032, y\u2032}. Consequently M,x1 |= B 1 ap whereas M \u2032, x\u2032 6|= B1ap. Since \u03d5S \u2208 L S P \u2032 it follows from Lemma 10 that M,x |= \u03d5S iff M\n\u2032, x\u2032 |= \u03d5S . What this proves is that using the formula B1ap of L\nD, no matter the choice of formula \u03d5S of LS there will be models which B1ap distinguishes but \u03d5S does not, hence B 1 ap 6\u2261 \u03d5S . From this follows LD 6\u2266 LS as required.\nWe find that this result is quite surprising. Again it is a consequence of our use of the largest bisimulation when defining our semantics. The purpose of x1 in model M (which is otherwise identical to M \u2032) is to inject an additional belief sphere without adding any factual content from P \u2032, as that could allow the safe belief formula \u03d5S to distinguish x1 from x2.\nAt this point it might seem as if all hope was lost for the conditional belief modality, however our final direct result somewhat rebuilds the reputation of this hard-pressed modality. To this end we define for any k \u2208 N the language LDk, which contains every formula of LD for which if Bna\u03d5 occurs then n \u2264 k. In other words formulas of L Dk talk about belief to at most degree k, which comes in handy as we investigate the relative expressive power of LD and LC .\nLemma 11 Let k \u2208 N be given, and let (Mk, w0) and (N k, w\u20320) denote the two plausibility models presented in Figure 7. Then we have that (Mk, w0) and (N k, w\u20320) are modally equivalent in LDk.\nProof We prove a stronger version of this lemma, namely that (Mk, wi) \u2261 Dk (Nk, w\u2032i) for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k, (Mk, x) \u2261Dk (Nk, x\u2032) and (Mk, y) \u2261Dk (Nk, y\u2032). Key to this proof is the fact that x (resp. y) has the same valuation as x\u2032 (resp. y\u2032), and that x is more plausible than y whereas y\u2032 is more plausible than x\u2032. We proceed by induction on \u03d5 \u2208 LDk. In the base case \u03d5 is a propositional symbol, and so as the valuation of each wi matches that of w\u2032i (0 \u2264 i \u2264 k), x matches x\n\u2032 and y matches y\u2032 this completes the base case. The cases of negation and conjunction readily follow using the induction hypothesis, and for \u03d5 = Ka\u03c8 the argument is essentially that used in the proof of Lemma 9.\nLastly we consider \u03d5 = Bja\u03c8 for any 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k, and recall that this is sufficient as \u03d5 \u2208 LDkP . As neither model contains two worlds with the same valuation, the largest autobisimulation on either model is the identity, and so both models are normal. With the epistemic relation of agent a being total, we have for all w \u2208 W that Minja[w]a = {w0, . . . , wj} and similarly for all w\u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 that Minja[w \u2032]a = {w \u2032 0, . . . , w \u2032 j}. We therefore have\n\u2200w \u2208 W : Mk, w |= Bja\u03c8 \u21d4 \u2200v \u2208 {w0, . . . , wj} : M k, v |= \u03c8\n(IH) \u21d0=\u21d2\n\u2200v\u2032 \u2208 {w\u20320, . . . , w \u2032 j} : N k, v\u2032 |= \u03c8 \u21d4 \u2200w\u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 : Nk, w\u2032 |= Bja\u03c8\nas required. Observe that we can apply the induction hypothesis since j \u2264 k, and that importantly x, y are not in Minja[w]a, and x \u2032, y\u2032 are not in Minja[w \u2032]a. Thus we have shown that (Mk, w0) \u2261 Dk (Nk, w\u20320) thereby completing the proof.\nProposition 13 LC 6\u2266 LD.\nProof Consider now Bqar belonging to LC and any formula \u03d5D \u2208 L D. Since \u03d5D is finite we can choose some k \u2208 N such that \u03d5D \u2208 L Dk. Because p0, . . . , pk, q, r is taken from the countably infinite set P , no matter the choice of k there exists pointed plausibility models (Mk, w0) and (N k, w\u20320) as presented in Figure 7.\nTo determine the truth of Bqar in (Mk, w0) and (N k, w\u20320) respectively we point out that [[q]]Mk = {x, y} and [[q]]Nk = {y \u2032, x\u2032}. Therefore we have that Mina([[q]]Mk \u2229 [w0]a) = {x} and Mina([[q]]Nk \u2229 [w \u2032 0]a) = {y \u2032}. Since Mk, x |= r and Nk, y\u2032 6|= r, it follows Mk, w0 |= B q ar whereas Nk, w\u20320 6|= B q ar. By Lemma 11 we have that Mk, w0 |= \u03d5D iff N\nk, w\u20320 |= \u03d5D. With this we have shown that taking the formula Bqar of LC , there is for any \u03d5D \u2208 L\nD pointed plausibility models which Bqar distinguishes but \u03d5D does not, thus B q ar 6\u2261 \u03d5D. It follows that LC 6\u2266 LD as required.\nWe have now shown that the degrees of belief modality cannot capture the conditional belief modality.

Our expressivity results can be summarised as (Theorem 4)\nLC < LS LC \u22b2\u22b3 LD LD \u22b2\u22b3 LS\nThe logic of conditional belief is less expressive than the logic of safe belief, the logic of conditional belief and the logic of degrees of belief are incomparable, as are the logic of degrees of belief and the logic of safe belief.\nOur results on bisimulation characterisation suggest that, in some sense, the three logics are the same, whereas our results on expressive power suggest that, in another sense, the three logics are different. It is therefore a good moment to explain how to interpret our results.\nThe bisimulation characterisation result in Corollary 1 says that the information content of a given plausibility model is equally well described in the three logics. Now consider an even more specific case: a finite model; and consider a characteristic formula of that model (these can be shown to exist for plausibility models along the lines of [29, 36]\u2014where we note that we take models, not pointed models). For a model M this gives us, respectively, formulas \u03d5CM , \u03d5 D M , and \u03d5 S M . Then the bisimulation characterisation results say that \u03d5 C M , \u03d5 D M , and \u03d5 S M are all equivalent. Now a characteristic formula is a very special formula with a unique model (modulo bisimilarity). For other formulas that do not have a singleton denotation (again, modulo bisimilarity) in the class of plausibility models, this equivalence cannot be achieved. That is the expressivity result. For example, given that LC < LS , there is a safe belief formula that is not equivalent to any conditional belief formula. This formula should then describe a property that has several non-bisimilar models. It is indeed the case that the formula \u2666ap used in the proof of Proposition 11 demonstrating LC < LS has many models! It is tempting to allow ourselves a simplication and to say that the expressivity hierarchy breaks down if we restrict ourselves to formulas with unique models.4\nFinally, we must point out that in the publication on single-agent bisimulation [4, p. 285], we posed the following conjecture:\nIn an extended version of the paper we are confident that we will prove that the logics of conditional belief and knowledge, of degrees of belief and knowledge, and both with the addition of safe belief are all expressively equivalent.\nIt therefore seems appropriate to note that we have proved our own confident selves resoundingly wrong!"}, {"heading": "6 Comparison and applications", "text": "We compare our bisimulation results to those in Demey\u2019s work [12], our expressivity results to those obtained in Baltag and Smets\u2019 [7], and finally discuss the relevance of our results for epistemic planning [10].\nBisimulation Prior to our work Demey discussed the model theory of plausibility models in great detail in [12]. Our results add to the valuable original results he obtained. Demey does not consider degrees of belief; he considers knowledge, conditional belief and safe belief. Our plausibility models are what [12] refers to as uniform and locally connected epistemic\n4If we consider infinitary versions of the modalities in our logical languages, in other words, common knowledge and common belief modalities, we preserve the bisimulation characterisation results (for a more refined notion of bisimulation) but it is then to be expected that all three logics become equally expressive (oral communication by Tim French).\nplausibility models; he also considers models with fewer restrictions on the plausibility function. But given [12, Theorem 35], these types of models are for all intents and purposes equivalent to ours. The semantics for conditional belief and knowledge are as ours, but his semantics for safe belief is different (namely as in [7]). The difference is that in his case an agent safely believes \u03d5 if \u03d5 is true in all worlds as least as plausible as the current world, whereas in our case it is like that but in the normalised model. This choice of semantics has several highly significant implications as we will return to shortly.\nIn line with his interpretation of safe belief as a standard modality, Demey\u2019s notion of bisimulation for plausibility models is also standard. For example, whereas we require that\n[forth\u2265] If v \u2208 W and w \u2265 R a v, \u2203v \u2032 \u2208 W such that w\u2032 \u2265Ra v \u2032 and (v, v\u2032) \u2208 R,\nwhere we recall that w \u2265Ra v means Mina([w]R \u2229 [w]a) \u2265a Mina([v]R \u2229 [v]a), he requires that\n[forth\u2265] If v \u2208 W and w \u2265a v, \u2203v \u2032 \u2208 W such that w\u2032 \u2265a v \u2032 and (v, v\u2032) \u2208 R.\nHe obtains correspondence for bisimulation and modal equivalence in the logic of safe belief in [12, Footnote 12 and Theorem 32]. Our notion of bisimulation is less restrictive, as we will now illustrate by way of the examples in Figure 9.\nConsider model Mi in Figure 9. This is a single-agent model on a single proposition p containing i worlds, where the image of a world wj under \u2265a is {w1, . . . , wj}. The valuation is such that if the index of a world is even then p holds, and otherwise p does not hold. Now, using Demey\u2019s notion of bisimulation entails that the largest autobisimulation on Mi is the identity, and thus Mi is a bisimulation contraction. For example, we can find a formula that distinguishes (Mi, wi) from (Mi+2, wi+2). For safe belief we now have Demey\u2019s semantics (see above) M,w |= a\u03d5 iff M,v |= \u03d5 for all v with w \u2265a v. We now define \u03d50 = \u22a4 and for any natural number n \u2265 1 we let:\n\u03d5n =\n{ \u2666a(\u03d5n\u22121 \u2227 p) if n is even;\n\u2666a(\u03d5n\u22121 \u2227 \u00acp) if n is odd;\nfor example \u03d54 = \u2666a(\u2666a(\u2666a(\u2666a(\u22a4 \u2227 \u00acp) \u2227 p) \u2227 \u00acp) \u2227 p).\nWe now have that for any i \u2265 1, Mi, wi |= \u03d5i \u2227 \u00ac\u03d5i+1, which makes this a distinguishing formula between (Mi, wi) from (Mi+2, wi+2). In fact, the semantics of a allow us to count the number of worlds in Mi. In this sense Demey\u2019s logic is immensely expressive.\nAgain referring to Figure 9, consider M3, the model with a most plausible \u00acp world, a less plausible p world and an even less plausible \u00acp world. In the logic LC of conditional belief w1 and w3 of M3 are modally equivalent. Hence they also ought to be bisimilar. But in Demey\u2019s notion of bisimilarity they are not. Hence we have a mismatch between modal\nequivalence and bisimilarity, which is not supposed to happen: it is possible for two worlds to be modally equivalent but not bisimilar. Demey also was aware of this, of course. To remedy the problem one can either strengthen the notion of modal equivalence or weaken the notion of bisimilarity. Demey chose the former (namely by adding the safe belief modality to the conditional belief modality), we chose the latter. Thus we regain the correspondence between bisimilarity and modal equivalence. Baltag and Smets [7] achieve the same via a different route: they include in the language special propositional symbols, so-called S-propositions. The denotation of an S-proposition can be any subset of the domain. This therefore also makes the language much more expressive.\nWe believe that in particular for application purposes, weakening the notion of bisimulation, as we have done, is preferable over strengthening the logic, as in [7, 12]. This come at the price of a more complex bisimulation definition (and, although we did not investigate this, surely a higher complexitity of determining whether two worlds are bisimilar), but, we venture to observe, also a very elegant bisimulation definition given the ingenious use of the bisimulation relation itself in the definition of the forth and back conditions of bisimulation. We consider this one of the highlights of our work.\nExpressivity In [7] one finds many original expressivity results. Our results copy those, but also go beyond. We recall Table 1 for the full picture of our results, and the main results of those namely LC < LS , LC \u22b2\u22b3 LD, and LD \u22b2\u22b3 LS. The first, LC < LS , is originally found in [7, page 34, Equation 1.7], and we obtained it using the same embedding translation. However, it may be worth to point out that in our case this translation still holds for the (in our opinion) more proper bisimulation preserving notion of safe belief. Baltag and Smets\u2019 S-propositions are arbitrary subsets of the domain, the (unnecessarily) far more expressive notion of safe belief. Baltag and Smets also discuss degrees of belief but do not obtain expressivity results for that, so LC \u22b2\u22b3 LD may be considered novel and interesting. In artificial intelligence, the degrees of belief notion seems more widely in use than the conditional belief notion, so an informed reader had better be aware of the incomparability of both logics and may choose the logic to suit his or her needs. The result that LD \u22b2\u22b3 LS could possibly also be considered unexpected, and therefore valuable.\nPlanning An application area of plausibility models is epistemic planning. A consequence of Demey\u2019s notion of bisimulation is that even for single-agent models on a finite set of propositions, the set of distinct, contraction-minimal pointed plausibility models is infinite. For example, we recall that in Figure 9 any two pointed plausibility models in {(Mi, wi) | i \u2208 N} are non-bisimilar. With our notion of bisimulation, there are in the single-agent case only finitely many distinct pointed plausibility models up to bisimulation. This was already reported in [4]. Our motivation for this bisimulation investigation was indeed prompted by the application of doxastic logics in planning.\nIn planning, an agent attempt to find a sequence of action, a plan, that achieves a given goal. A planning problem implicitly represents a state-transition system, where transitions are induced by actions. By exploring this state-space we can reason about actions and synthesise plans. A growing community investigates planning by applying dynamic epistemic logics [10, 24, 1], where actions are epistemic actions. Planning with doxastic modalities has also been considered [2]. This is done by identifying states with (pointed) plausibility models, and the goal with a formula of the doxastic language. Epistemic actions can be public actions, like hard and soft announcements [30], but also non-public actions, such as event models [7].\nWith the state-space consisting of plausibility models, model theoretic results become pivotal when deciding the plan existence problem. Unlike Demey\u2019s approach, our framework leads to a finite state-space in the single-agent case and therefore the single-agent plan existence problem is decidable [10]. At the same time we know that even in a purely epistemic\nsetting the multi-agent plan existence problem is undecidable [10]. But by placing certain restrictions on the planning problem it is possible to find decidable fragments even in the multi-agent case, for example, event models with propositional preconditions [39]."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Hans van Ditmarsch is also affiliated to IMSc (Institute of Mathematical Sciences), Chennai, as research associate.

Such models are used to interpret the notions of conditional belief, degrees of belief, and safe belief. The logic of conditional belief contains that modality and also the knowledge modality, and similarly for the logic of degrees of belief and the logic of safe belief. With respect to these logics, plausibility models may contain too much information. A proper notion of bisimulation is required that characterises them. We define that notion of bisimulation and prove the required characterisations: on the class of image-finite and preimage-finite models (with respect to the plausibility relation), two pointed Kripke models are modally equivalent in either of the three logics, if and only if they are bisimilar. As a result, the information content of such a model can be similarly expressed in the logic of conditional belief, or the logic of degrees of belief, or that of safe belief. This, we found a surprising result. Still, that does not mean that the logics are equally expressive: the logics of conditional and degrees of belief are incomparable, the logics of degrees of belief and safe belief are incomparable, while the logic of safe belief is more expressive than the logic of conditional belief. In view of the result on bisimulation characterisation, this is an equally surprising result.
