Description Logics (DLs) are a well-studied family of knowledge representation formalisms [Baader et al., 2007]. They constitute the logical backbone of the standard Semantic Web ontology language OWL 2,1 and its profiles, and have been successfully applied to represent the knowledge of many and diverse application domains, particularly in the bio-medical sciences.\nDLs describe the domain knowledge using concepts (such as Patient) that represent sets of individuals, and roles (hasRelative) that represent connections between individuals. Ontologies are collections of axioms formulated over these concepts and roles, which restrict their possible interpretations. The typical axioms considered in DLs are assertions, like bob:Patient, providing knowledge about specific individuals; and general concept inclusions (GCIs), such as Patient \u2291 Human, which express general relations between concepts. Different DLs are characterized by the constructors\n1http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/\nallowed to generate complex concepts and roles from atomic ones. ALC [Schmidt-Schau\u00df and Smolka, 1991] is a prototypical DL of intermediate expressivity that contains the concept constructors conjunction (C \u2293 D), negation (\u00acC), and existential restriction (\u2203r.C for a role r). If additionally qualified number restrictions (>n r.C for n \u2208 N) are allowed, the resulting logic is denoted by ALCQ. Common reasoning problems in ALCQ, such as consistency of ontologies or subsumption between concepts, are known to be EXPTIMEcomplete [Schild, 1991; Tobies, 2001].\nFuzzy Description Logics (FDLs) have been introduced as extensions of classical DLs to represent and reason with vague knowledge. The main idea is to consider all the truth values from the interval [0, 1] instead of only true and false. In this way, it is possible give a more fine-grained semantics to inherently vague concepts like LowFrequency or HighConcentration, which can be found in biomedical ontologies like SNOMED CT,2 and Galen.3 The different members of the family of FDLs are characterized not only by the constructors they allow, but also by the way these constructors are interpreted.\nTo interpret conjunction in complex concepts like\n\u2203hasHeartRate.LowFrequency \u2293 \u2203hasBloodAlcohol.HighConcentration,\na popular approach is to use so-called tnorms [Klement et al., 2000]. The semantics of the other logical constructors can then be derived from these t-norms in a principled way, as suggested by H\u00e1jek [2001]. Following the principles of mathematical fuzzy logic, existential restrictions are interpreted as suprema of truth values. However, to avoid problems with infinitely many truth values, reasoning in fuzzy DLs is often restricted to so-called witnessed models [H\u00e1jek, 2005], in which these suprema are required to be maxima; i.e., the degree is witnessed by at least one domain element.\nUnfortunately, reasoning in most FDLs becomes undecidable when the logic allows to use GCIs and negation under witnessed model semantics [Baader and Pe\u00f1aloza, 2011; Cerami and Straccia, 2013; Borgwardt et al., 2015]. One of the few exceptions known are FDLs using the\n2http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/ 3http://www.opengalen.org/\nG\u00f6del t-norm defined as min{x, y} to interpret conjunctions [Borgwardt et al., 2014]. Despite not being as wellbehaved as finitely valued FDLs, which use a finite total order of truth values instead of the infinite interval [0, 1] [Borgwardt and Pe\u00f1aloza, 2013], it has been shown using an automata-based approach that reasoning in G\u00f6del extensions of ALC exhibits the same complexity as in the classical case, i.e. it is EXPTIME-complete. A major drawback of this approach is that it always has an exponential runtime, even when the input ontology has a simple form.\nIn this paper, we extend the results of [Borgwardt et al., 2014] to deal with qualified number restrictions, showing again that the complexity of reasoning remains the same as for the classical case; i.e., it is EXPTIME-complete. To this end, we focus only on the problem of local consistency, which is a generalization of the classical concept satisfiability problem. We follow a more practical approach that combines the automata-based construction from [Borgwardt et al., 2014] with reduction techniques developed for finitely valued FDLs [Straccia, 2004; Bobillo et al., 2009; Bobillo and Straccia, 2013]. We exploit the forest model property of classical ALCQ [Kazakov, 2004] to encode order relationships between concepts in a fuzzy interpretation in a manner similar to the Hintikka trees from [Borgwardt et al., 2014]. However, instead of using automata to determine the existence of such trees, we reduce the fuzzy ontology directly into a classical ALCQ ontology whose local consistency is equivalent to that of the original ontology. This enables us to use optimized reasoners for classical DLs. In addition to the cut-concepts of the form C > q for a fuzzy concept C and a value q, which are used in the reductions for finitely valued DLs [Straccia, 2004; Bobillo et al., 2009; Bobillo and Straccia, 2013], we employ order concepts C 6 D expressing relationships between fuzzy concepts. Contrary to the reductions for finitely valued G\u00f6del FDLs presented by Bobillo et al. [2009; 2012], our reduction produces a classical ontology whose size is polynomial in the size of the input fuzzy ontology. Thus, we obtain tight complexity bounds for reasoning in this FDL [Tobies, 2001]. An extended version of this paper appears in [Borgwardt and Pe\u00f1aloza, 2015]."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "For the rest of this paper, we focus solely on vague statements that take truth degrees from the infinite interval [0, 1], where the G\u00f6del t-norm, defined by min{x, y}, is used to interpret logical conjunction. The semantics of implications is given by the residuum of this t-norm; that is,\nx \u21d2 y :=\n{\n1 if x 6 y, y otherwise.\nWe use both the residual negation \u2296x := x \u21d2 0 and the involutive negation \u223cx := 1\u2212 x in the rest of this paper.\nWe first recall some basic definitions from [Borgwardt et al., 2014], which will be used extensively in the proofs throughout this work. An order structure S is a finite set containing at least the numbers 0, 0.5, and 1, together with an involutive unary operation\ninv : S \u2192 S such that inv(x) = 1\u2212x for all x \u2208 S\u2229 [0, 1]. A total preorder over S is a transitive and total binary relation 4 \u2286 S \u00d7 S. For x, y \u2208 S, we write x \u2261 y if x 4 y and y 4 x. Notice that \u2261 is an equivalence relation on S. The total preorders considered in [Borgwardt et al., 2014] have to satisfy additional properties; for instance, that 0 and 1 are always the least and greatest elements, respectively. These properties can be found in our reduction in the axioms of red(U) (see Section 3 for more details).\nThe syntax of the FDL G-IALCQ is the same as that of classical ALCQ, with the addition of the implication constructor (denoted by the use of I at the beginning of the name). This constructor is often added to FDLs, as the residuum cannot, in general, be expressed using only the t-norm and negation operators, in contrast to the classical semantics. In particular, this holds for the G\u00f6del t-norm and its residuum, which is the focus of this work. Let now NC, NR, and NI be mutually disjoint sets of concept, role, and individual names, respectively. Concepts of G-IALCQ are built using the syntax rule\nC,D ::= \u22a4 | A | \u00acC | C \u2293D | C \u2192 D | \u2200r.C | >n r.C,\nwhere A \u2208 NC, r \u2208 NR, C,D are concepts, and n \u2208 N. We use the abbreviations\n\u22a5 := \u00ac\u22a4,\nC \u2294D := \u00ac(\u00acC \u2293 \u00acD),\n\u2203r.C := >1 r.C, and\n6n r.C := \u00ac(>(n+ 1) r.C)\nNotice that Bobillo et al. consider a different definition of atmost restrictions, which uses the residual negation; that is, they define 6n r.C := (>(n + 1) r.C) \u2192 \u22a5 [2012]. This has the strange side effect that the value of 6n r.C is always either 0 or 1 (see the semantics below). However, this discrepancy in definitions is not an issue since our algorithm can handle both cases.\nThe semantics of this logic is based on interpretations. A G-interpretation is a pair I = (\u2206I , \u00b7I), where \u2206I is a nonempty set called the domain, and \u00b7I is the interpretation function that assigns to each individual name a \u2208 NI an element aI \u2208 \u2206I , to each concept name A \u2208 NC a fuzzy set AI : \u2206I \u2192 [0, 1], and to each role name r \u2208 NR a fuzzy binary relation rI : \u2206I \u00d7 \u2206I \u2192 [0, 1]. The interpretation of complex concepts is obtained from the semantics of first-order fuzzy logics via the well-known translation from DL concepts to first-order logic [Straccia, 2001; Bobillo et al., 2012], i.e. for all d \u2208 \u2206I ,\n\u22a4I(d) := 1\n(\u00acC)I(d) := 1\u2212 CI(d)\n(C \u2293D)I(d) := min{CI(d), DI(d)}\n(C \u2192 D)I(d) := CI(d) \u21d2 DI(d)\n(\u2200r.C)I(d) := inf e\u2208\u2206I rI(d, e) \u21d2 CI(e)\n(>n r.C)I(d) := sup e1,...,en\u2208\u2206 I\npairwise different\nn\nmin i=1\nmin{rI(d, ei), C I(ei)}\nRecall that the usual duality between existential and value restrictions that appears in classical DLs does not hold in G-IALCQ.\nA classical interpretation is defined similarly, with the set of truth values restricted to 0 and 1. In this case, the semantics of a conceptC is commonly viewed as a set CI \u2286 \u2206I instead of the characteristic function CI : \u2206I \u2192 {0, 1}.\nIn the following, we restrict all reasoning problems to socalled witnessed G-interpretations [H\u00e1jek, 2005], which intuitively require the suprema and infima in the semantics to be maxima and minima, respectively. More formally, the G-interpretation I is witnessed if, for every d \u2208 \u2206I , n > 0, r \u2208 NR, and concept C, there exist e, e1, . . . , en \u2208 \u2206I (where e1, . . . , en are pairwise different) such that\n(\u2200r.C)I(d) = rI(d, e) \u21d2 CI(e) and\n(>n r.C)I(d) = n\nmin i=1\nmin{rI(d, ei), C I(ei)}.\nThe axioms of G-IALCQ extend classical axioms by allowing to compare degrees of arbitrary assertions in so-called ordered ABoxes [Borgwardt et al., 2014], and to state inclusions relationships between fuzzy concepts that hold to a certain degree, instead of only 1. A classical assertion is an expression of the form a :C or (a, b):r for a, b \u2208 NI, r \u2208 NR, and a concept C. An order assertion is of the form \u3008\u03b1 \u22b2\u22b3 q\u3009 or \u3008\u03b1 \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2\u3009 where \u22b2\u22b3 \u2208 {<,6,=,>, >}, \u03b1, \u03b2 are classical assertions, and q \u2208 [0, 1]. A (fuzzy) general concept inclusion axiom (GCI) is of the form \u3008C \u2291 D > q\u3009 for concepts C,D and q \u2208 [0, 1]. An ordered ABox is a finite set of order assertions, a TBox is a finite set of GCIs, and an ontology O = (A, T ) consists of an ordered ABox A and a TBox T . A G-interpretation I satisfies (or is a model of) an order assertion \u3008\u03b1 \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2\u3009 if \u03b1I \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2I (where (a :C)I := CI(aI), ((a, b):r)I := rI(aI , bI), and qI := q); it satisfies a GCI \u3008C \u2291 D > q\u3009 if CI(d) \u21d2 DI(d) > q holds for all d \u2208 \u2206I ; and it satisfies an ordered ABox, TBox, or ontology if it satisfies all its axioms. An ontology is consistent if it has a (witnessed) model.\nGiven an ontology O, we denote by rol(O) the set of all role names occurring in O and by sub(O) the closure under negation of the set of all subconcepts occurring in O. We consider the concepts \u00ac\u00acC and C to be equal, and thus the latter set is of quadratic size in the size of O. Moreover, we denote by VO the closure under the involutive negation x 7\u2192 1 \u2212 x of the set of all truth degrees appearing in O, together with 0, 0.5, and 1. This set is of size linear on the size of O. We sometimes denote the elements of VO \u2286 [0, 1] as 0 = q0 < q1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < qk\u22121 < qk = 1.\nWe stress that we do not consider the general consistency problem in this paper, but only a restricted version that uses only one individual name. An ordered ABox A is local if it contains no role assertions (a, b):r and there is a single individual name a \u2208 NI such that all order assertions in A only use a. The local consistency problem, i.e. deciding whether an ontology (A, T ) with a local ordered ABox A is consistent, can be seen as a generalization of the classical concept satisfiability problem [Borgwardt and Pe\u00f1aloza, 2013].\nOther common reasoning problems for FDLs, such as concept satisfiability and subsumption can be reduced to local\nconsistency [Borgwardt et al., 2014]: the subsumption between C and D to degree q w.r.t. a TBox T is equivalent to the (local) inconsistency of ({\u3008a :C \u2192 D < q\u3009}, T ), and the satisfiability of C to degree q w.r.t. T is equivalent to the (local) consistency of ({\u3008a :C > q\u3009}, T ).\nIn the following section we show how to decide local consistency of a G-IALCQ ontology through a reduction to classical ontology consistency."}, {"heading": "3 Deciding Local Consistency", "text": "Let O = (A, T ) be a G-IALCQ ontology where A is a local ordered ABox that uses only the individual name a. The main ideas behind the reduction to classical ALCQ are that it suffices to consider tree-shaped interpretations, where each domain element has a unique role predecessor, and that we only have to consider the order between values of concepts, instead of their precise values. This insight allows us to consider only finitely many different cases [Borgwardt et al., 2014].\nTo compare the values of the elements of sub(O) at different domain elements, we use the order structure\nU := VO \u222a sub(O) \u222a sub\u2191(O) \u222a {\u03bb,\u00ac\u03bb},\nwhere sub\u2191(O) := {\u3008C\u3009\u2191 | C \u2208 sub(O)}, inv(\u03bb) := \u00ac\u03bb, inv(C) := \u00acC, and inv(\u3008C\u3009\u2191) := \u3008\u00acC\u3009\u2191, for all concepts C \u2208 sub(O). The idea is that total preorders over U describe the relationships between the values of sub(O) and VO at a single domain element. The elements of sub\u2191(O) allow us to additionally refer to the relevant values at the unique role predecessor of the current domain element (in a tree-shaped interpretation). The value \u03bb represents the value of the role connection from this predecessor. For convenience, we define \u3008q\u3009\u2191 := q for all q \u2208 VO .\nIn order to describe such total preorders in a classical ALCQ ontology, we employ special concept names of the form \u03b1 6 \u03b2 for \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 U . This differs from previous reductions for finitely valued FDLs [Straccia, 2004; Bobillo and Straccia, 2011; Bobillo et al., 2012] in that we not only consider cut-concepts of the form q 6 \u03b1 with q \u2208 VO , but also relationships between different concepts.4 For convenience, we introduce the abbreviations \u03b1 > \u03b2 := \u03b2 6 \u03b1 , \u03b1 < \u03b2 := \u00ac\u03b1 > \u03b2 , and similarly for = and >. Furthermore, we define the complex expressions\n\u2022 \u03b1 > min{\u03b2, \u03b3} := \u03b1 > \u03b2 \u2294 \u03b1 > \u03b3 ,\n\u2022 \u03b1 6 min{\u03b2, \u03b3} := \u03b1 6 \u03b2 \u2293 \u03b1 6 \u03b3 ,\n\u2022 \u03b1 > \u03b2 \u21d2 \u03b3 := (\u03b2 6 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b1 > 1 )\u2293(\u03b2 > \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b1 > \u03b3 ),\n\u2022 \u03b1 6 \u03b2 \u21d2 \u03b3 := \u03b2 6 \u03b3 \u2294 \u03b1 6 \u03b3 ,\nand extend these notions to the expressions \u03b1 \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2 \u21d2 \u03b3 etc., for \u22b2\u22b3 \u2208 {<,=, >}, analogously.\nFor each concept C \u2208 sub(O), we now define the classical\n4For the rest of this paper, expressions of the form \u03b1 6 \u03b2 denote (classical) concept names.\nALCQ TBox red(C), depending on the form ofC, as follows.\nred(\u22a4) := {\u22a4 \u2291 \u22a4 > 1}\nred(\u00acC) := \u2205\nred(C \u2293D) := {\u22a4 \u2291 C \u2293D = min{C,D}}\nred(C \u2192 D) := {\u22a4 \u2291 C \u2192 D = C \u21d2 D }\nred(\u2200r.C) := {\u22a4 \u2291 \u2203r. \u3008\u2200r.C\u3009\u2191 > \u03bb \u21d2 C \u2293\n\u2200r. \u3008\u2200r.C\u3009\u2191 6 \u03bb \u21d2 C }\nred(>n r.C) := {\u22a4 \u2291 >n r. \u3008>n r.C\u3009\u2191 6 min{\u03bb,C} \u2293\n\u00ac>n r. \u3008>n r.C\u3009\u2191 < min{\u03bb,C}}\nIntuitively, red(C) describes the semantics of C in terms of its order relationships to other elements of U . Note that the semantics of the involutive negation \u00acC = inv(C) is already handled by the operator inv (see also the last line of the definition of red(U) below).\nThe reduced classical ALCQ ontology red(O) is defined as follows:\nred(O) := (red(A), red(U) \u222a red(\u2191) \u222a red(T )),\nred(A) := {a :C \u22b2\u22b3 q | \u3008a :C \u22b2\u22b3 q\u3009 \u2208 A} \u222a\n{a :C \u22b2\u22b3 D | \u3008a :C \u22b2\u22b3 a :D\u3009 \u2208 A},\nred(U) := {\u03b1 6 \u03b2 \u2293 \u03b2 6 \u03b3 \u2291 \u03b1 6 \u03b3 | \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 U} \u222a\n{\u22a4 \u2291 \u03b1 6 \u03b2 \u2294 \u03b2 6 \u03b1 | \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 U} \u222a\n{\u22a4 \u2291 0 6 \u03b1 \u2293 \u03b1 6 1 | \u03b1 \u2208 U} \u222a\n{\u22a4 \u2291 \u03b1 \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2 | \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 VO, \u03b1 \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2} \u222a\n{\u03b1 6 \u03b2 \u2291 inv(\u03b2) 6 inv(\u03b1) | \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 U},\nred(\u2191) := {\u03b1 \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2 \u2291 \u2200r. \u3008\u03b1\u3009\u2191 \u22b2\u22b3 \u3008\u03b2\u3009\u2191 |\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 VO \u222a sub(O), r \u2208 rol(O)},\nred(T ) := {\u22a4 \u2291 q 6 C \u21d2 D | \u3008C \u2291 D > q\u3009 \u2208 T } \u222a \u22c3\nC\u2208sub(O)\nred(C).\nWe briefly explain this construction. The reductions of the order assertions and fuzzy GCIs in O are straightforward; the former expresses that the individual a must belong to the corresponding order concept C \u22b2\u22b3 q or C \u22b2\u22b3 D, while the latter expresses that every element of the domain must satisfy the restriction provided by the fuzzy GCI. The axioms of red(U) intuitively ensure that the relation \u201c6\u201d forms a total preorder that is compatible with all the values in VO, and that inv is an antitone operator. Finally, the TBox red(\u2191) expresses a connection between the orders of a domain element and those of its role successors.\nThe following lemmata show that this reduction is correct; i.e., that it preserves local consistency.\nLemma 1. If red(O) has a classical model, then O has a G-model.\nProof. By [Kazakov, 2004], red(O) must have a tree model I, i.e. we can assume that \u2206I is a prefix-closed subset of N\u2217, aI = \u03b5, for all n1, . . . , nk \u2208 N, k > 1, with u := n1 . . . nk \u2208 \u2206I , the element u\u2191 := n1 . . . nk\u22121 \u2208 \u2206I\nis an r-predecessor of u for some r \u2208 rol(O), and there are no other role connections. For any u \u2208 \u2206I , we denote by 4u the corresponding total preorder on U , that is, we define \u03b1 4u \u03b2 iff u \u2208 \u03b1 6 \u03b2\nI , and by \u2261u the induced equivalence relation.\nAs a first step in the construction of a G-model of O, we define the auxiliary function v : U\u00d7\u2206I \u2192 [0, 1] that satisfies the following conditions for all u \u2208 \u2206I :\n(P1) for all q \u2208 VO , we have v(q, u) = q,\n(P2) for all \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 U , we have v(\u03b1, u) 6 v(\u03b2, u) iff \u03b1 4u \u03b2,\n(P3) for all \u03b1 \u2208 U , we have v(inv(\u03b1), u) = 1\u2212 v(\u03b1, u),\n(P4) if u 6= \u03b5, then for all C \u2208 sub(O) it holds that v(C, u\u2191) = v(\u3008C\u3009\u2191, u).\nWe define v by induction on the structure of \u2206I starting with \u03b5. Let U/\u2261\u03b5 be the set of all equivalence classes of \u2261\u03b5. Then 4\u03b5 yields a total order 6\u03b5 on U/\u2261\u03b5. Since I satisfies red(U), we have\n[0]\u03b5 <\u03b5 [q1]\u03b5 <\u03b5 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 <\u03b5 [qk\u22121]\u03b5 <\u03b5 [1]\u03b5\nw.r.t. this order. For every [\u03b1]\u03b5 \u2208 U/\u2261\u03b5, we now set inv([\u03b1]\u03b5) := [inv(\u03b1)]\u03b5. This function is well-defined by the axioms in red(U). On all \u03b1 \u2208 [q]\u03b5 for q \u2208 VO, we now define v(\u03b1, \u03b5) := q, which ensures that (P1) holds. For the equivalence classes that do not contain a value from VO , note that by red(U), every such class must be strictly between [qi]\u03b5 and [qi+1]\u03b5 for qi, qi+1 \u2208 VO. We denote the ni equivalence classes between [qi]\u03b5 and [qi+1]\u03b5 as follows:\n[qi]\u03b5 <\u03b5 E i 1 <\u03b5 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 <\u03b5 E i ni <\u03b5 [qi+1]\u03b5.\nFor every \u03b1 \u2208 Eij , we set v(\u03b1, \u03b5) := qi + j ni+1 (qi+1 \u2212 qi), which ensures that (P2) is also satisfied. Furthermore, observe that 1\u2212 qi+1 and 1\u2212 qi are also adjacent in VO and we have\n[1\u2212 qi+1]\u03b5 <\u03b5 inv(E i ni ) <\u03b5 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 <\u03b5 inv(E i 1) <\u03b5 [1\u2212 qi]\u03b5\nby the axioms in red(U). Hence, it follows from the definition of v(\u03b1, \u03b5) that (P3) holds.\nLet now u \u2208 \u2206I be such that the function v, satisfying the properties (P1)\u2013(P4), has already been defined for u\u2191. Since I is a tree model, there must be an r \u2208 NR such that (u\u2191, u) \u2208 rI . We again consider the set of equivalence classes U/\u2261u and set v(\u03b1, u) := q for all q \u2208 VO and \u03b1 \u2208 [q]u, and v(\u03b1, u) := v(C, u\u2191) for all C \u2208 sub(O) and \u03b1 \u2208 [\u3008C\u3009\u2191]u. To see that this is well-defined, consider the case that [\u3008C\u3009\u2191]u = [\u3008D\u3009\u2191]u, i.e. u \u2208 \u3008C\u3009\u2191 = \u3008D\u3009\u2191 I\n. From the axioms in red(\u2191) and the fact that (u\u2191, u) \u2208 rI , it follows that u\u2191 \u2208 C = D I , and thus [C]u\u2191 = [D]u\u2191 . Since (P2) is satisfied for u\u2191, we get v(C, u\u2191) = v(D, u\u2191). The same argument shows that [q]u = [\u3008q\u3009\u2191]u = [\u3008C\u3009\u2191]u implies v(q, u\u2191) = v(C, u\u2191). For the remaining equivalence classes, we can use a construction analogous to the case for \u03b5 by considering the two unique neighboring equivalence classes that contain an element of VO \u222a sub(O) (for which v has already been defined). This construction ensures that (P1)\u2013(P4) hold for u.\nBased on the function v, we define the G-interpretation If over the domain \u2206If := \u2206I , where aIf := aI = \u03b5;\nAIf (u) :=\n{\nv(A, u) if A \u2208 sub(O), 0 otherwise; and\nrIf (u,w) :=\n{\nv(\u03bb,w) if (u,w) \u2208 rI , 0 otherwise.\nWe show by induction on the structure of C that\nCIf (u) = v(C, u) for all C \u2208 sub(O) and u \u2208 \u2206I . (1)\nFor concept names, this holds by the definition of If . For \u22a4, we know that \u22a4If (u) = 1 = v(\u22a4, u) by the definition of red(\u22a4) and (P2). For \u00acC, we have\n(\u00acC)If (u) = 1\u2212 CIf (u) = 1\u2212 v(C, u) = v(\u00acC, u)\nby the induction hypothesis and (P3). For conjunctionsC\u2293D, we know that\n(C \u2293D)If (u) = min{CIf (u), DIf (u)}\n= min{v(C, u), v(D, u)}\n= v(C \u2293D, u)\nby the definition of red(C \u2293D) and (P2). Implications can be treated similarly.\nConsider a value restriction \u2200r.C \u2208 sub(O). For every w \u2208 \u2206I with (u,w) \u2208 rI , we have w \u2208 \u3008\u2200r.C\u3009\u2191 6 \u03bb \u21d2 C I since I satisfies red(\u2200r.C). By the induction hypothesis, the fact that w\u2191 = u, (P2), and (P4), this implies that v(\u2200r.C, u) 6 v(\u03bb,w) \u21d2 v(C,w) = rIf (u,w) \u21d2 CIf (w), and thus\n(\u2200r.C)If (u) = inf w\u2208\u2206I, (u,w)\u2208rI rIf (u,w) \u21d2 CIf (w)\n> v(\u2200r.C, u).\nFurthermore, by the existential restriction introduced in red(\u2200r.C), we know that there exists a w0 \u2208 \u2206I such that (u,w0) \u2208 rI and w0 \u2208 \u3008\u2200r.C\u3009\u2191 > \u03bb \u21d2 C I\n. By the same arguments as above, we get\nv(\u2200r.C, u) > rIf (u,w0) \u21d2 C If (w0)\n> (\u2200r.C)If (u),\nwhich concludes the proof of (1) for \u2200r.C. As a by-product, we have found in the element w0 the witness required for satisfying the concept \u2200r.C at u.\nConsider now >n r.C \u2208 sub(O). For any n-tuple (w1, . . . , wn) of different domain elements with (u,w1), . . . , (u,wn) \u2208 rI , by red(>n r.C) there must be an index i, 1 6 i 6 n, such that wi /\u2208 \u3008>n r.C\u3009\u2191 < min{\u03bb,C} I\n. Using arguments similar to those introduced above, we obtain that\nv(>n r.C, u) > min{rIf (u,wi), C If (wi)\n> n\nmin j=1\nmin{rIf (u,wj), C If (wj)}.\nOn the other hand, we know that there are n different elements w01 , . . . , w 0 n \u2208 \u2206 I such that (u,w0j ) \u2208 r I and\nwj \u2208 \u3008>n r.C\u3009\u2191 6 min{\u03bb,C} I\nfor all j, 1 6 j 6 n. As in the case of \u2200r.C above, we conclude that\nv(>n r.C, u) 6 n\nmin j=1\nmin{rIf (u,w0j ), C If (w0j )}\n6 (>n r.C)If (u) 6 v(>n r.C, u),\nas required. Furthermore, w01 , . . . , w 0 n are the required witnesses for >n r.C at u. This concludes the proof of (1). It remains to be shown that If is a model of O. For every \u3008a :C \u22b2\u22b3 q\u3009 \u2208 A, we have aI = \u03b5 \u2208 [C \u22b2\u22b3 q]I , and thus CIf (aIf ) = v(C, \u03b5) \u22b2\u22b3 v(q, \u03b5) = q by (1), (P1), and (P2). A similar argument works for handling order assertions of the form \u3008a :C \u22b2\u22b3 a :D\u3009. To conclude, consider an arbitrary GCI \u3008C \u2291 D > q\u3009 \u2208 T and u \u2208 \u2206I . By the definition of red(T ) and (P1), we have v(q, u) 6 v(C, u) \u21d2 v(D, u). Thus, (1) and (P2) yield CIf (u) \u21d2 DIf (u) > q. Thus, If satisfies all the axioms in O, which concludes the proof.\nFor the converse direction, we now show that it is possible to unravel every G-model of O into a classical tree model of red(O).\nLemma 2. If O has a G-model, then red(O) has a classical model.\nProof. Given a G-model I of O, we define a classical interpretation Ic over the domain \u2206Ic of all paths of the form \u033a = r1d1 . . . rmdm with ri \u2208 NR, di \u2208 \u2206I , m > 0. We set aIc := \u03b5 and\nrIc := {(\u033a, \u033ard) | \u033a \u2208 \u2206Ic , d \u2208 \u2206I}\nfor all r \u2208 NR. We denote by tail(r1d1 . . . rmdm) the element dm if m > 0, and aI if m = 0. Similarly, we set prev(r1d1 . . . rmdm) to dm\u22121 if m > 1, and to aI if m = 1. Finally, role(r1d1 . . . rmdm) denotes rm whenever m > 0. For any \u03b1 \u2208 U and \u033a \u2208 \u2206Ic , we define \u03b1I(\u033a) as\nCI(tail(\u033a)) if \u03b1 = C \u2208 sub(O);\nCI(prev(\u033a)) if \u03b1 = \u3008C\u3009\u2191, C \u2208 sub(O);\nq if \u03b1 = q \u2208 VO;\nrole(\u033a)I(prev(\u033a), tail(\u033a)) if \u03b1 = \u03bb;\n1\u2212 role(\u033a)I(prev(\u033a), tail(\u033a)) if \u03b1 = \u00ac\u03bb.\nNote that for \u033a = \u03b5 this expression is only defined for \u03b1 \u2208 VO \u222a sub(O). We fix the value of \u03b1I(\u03b5) for all other \u03b1 arbitrarily, in such a way that for all \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 U we have \u03b1I(\u03b5) 6 \u03b2I(\u03b5) iff inv(\u03b2)I(\u03b5) 6 inv(\u03b1)I(\u03b5). We can now define the interpretation of all concept names \u03b1 6 \u03b2 with \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 U as\n\u03b1 6 \u03b2 Ic := {\u033a | \u03b1I(\u033a) 6 \u03b2I(\u033a)}.\nIt is easy to see that we have \u033a \u2208 \u03b1 \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2 Ic iff \u03b1I(\u033a) \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2I(\u033a) also for all other order expressions \u22b2\u22b3, and that Ic satisfies red(U). We now show that Ic satisfies the remaining parts of red(O).\nFor any order assertion \u3008a :C \u22b2\u22b3 a :D\u3009 \u2208 A we have CI(aI) \u22b2\u22b3 DI(aI). This implies that CI(\u03b5) \u22b2\u22b3 DI(\u03b5),\nand thus aI = \u03b5 \u2208 C \u22b2\u22b3 D Ic , as required. A similar argument works for assertions of the form \u3008a :C \u22b2\u22b3 q\u3009. Consider now a GCI \u3008C \u2291 D > q\u3009 \u2208 T and any \u033a \u2208 \u2206Ic . We know that CI(tail(\u033a)) \u21d2 DI(tail(\u033a)) > q, and thus \u033a \u2208 q 6 C \u21d2 D\nIc . For red(\u2191), consider any \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 VO \u222a sub(O), r \u2208 rol(O), and \u033a \u2208 \u03b1 \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2 Ic . Thus, it holds that \u03b1I(\u033a) \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2I(\u033a). Every r-successor of \u033a in Ic must be of the form \u033ard. Since \u3008\u03b1\u3009I\u2191 (\u033ard) = \u03b1\nI(\u033a) \u22b2\u22b3 \u03b2I(\u033a) = \u3008\u03b2\u3009I\u2191 (\u033ard), we know that all r-successors of \u033a satisfy \u3008\u03b1\u3009\u2191 \u22b2\u22b3 \u3008\u03b2\u3009\u2191 .\nIt remains to be shown that Ic satisfies red(C) for all concepts C \u2208 sub(O). For C = \u22a4, the claim follows from the fact that \u22a4I(\u033a) = \u22a4I(tail(\u033a)) = 1. For \u00acC, the result is trivial, and for conjunctions and implications, it follows from the semantics of \u2293 and \u2192 and the properties of min and \u21d2, respectively.\nConsider the case of \u2200r.C and an arbitrary domain element \u033a \u2208 \u2206Ic , and set d := tail(\u033a). Since I is witnessed, there must be an e \u2208 \u2206I such that\n\u3008\u2200r.C\u3009I\u2191 (\u033are) = (\u2200r.C) I(d)\n= rI(d, e) \u21d2 CI(e)\n= \u03bbI(\u033are) \u21d2 CI(\u033are).\nSince (\u033a, \u033are) \u2208 rIc , this shows that \u2203r. \u3008\u2200r.C\u3009\u2191 > \u03bb \u21d2 C is satisfied by \u033a in Ic. Additionally, for any r-successor \u033are of \u033a we have\n\u3008\u2200r.C\u3009I\u2191 (\u033are) = (\u2200r.C) I(d)\n6 rI(d, e) \u21d2 CI(e)\n= \u03bbI(\u033are) \u21d2 CI(\u033are),\nand thus \u2200r. \u3008\u2200r.C\u3009\u2191 6 \u03bb \u21d2 C is also satisfied. For at-least restrictions >n r.C, we similarly know that there are n different elements e1, . . . , en such that, for all i, 1 6 i 6 n,\n\u3008>n r.C\u3009I\u2191 (\u033arei) = (>n r.C) I(d)\n= n\nmin j=1\nmin{rI(d, ej), C I(ej)}\n6 min{rI(d, ei), C I(ei)}\n= min{\u03bbI(\u033arei), C I(\u033arei)}.\nSince also the elements \u033are1, . . . , \u033aren are different, this shows that the at-least restriction >n r. \u3008>n r.C\u3009\u2191 6 min{\u03bb,C} is satisfied by Ic at \u033a. On the other hand, for all n-tuples (\u033are1, . . . , \u033aren) of different r-successors of \u033a and all i, 1 6 i 6 n, we must have\n\u3008>n r.C\u3009I\u2191 (\u033arei) = (>n r.C) I(d)\n> n\nmin j=1\nmin{rI(d, ej), C I(ej)}\n= n\nmin j=1\nmin{\u03bbI(\u033arej), C I(\u033arej)},\nand thus there must be at least one j, 1 6 j 6 n, such that\n\u033arej \u2208 \u3008>n r.C\u3009\u2191 > min{\u03bb,C} Ic .\nIn other words, there can be no n different elements of the form \u033are that satisfy \u033are \u2208 \u3008>n r.C\u3009\u2191 < min{\u03bb,C} Ic , i.e. \u033a /\u2208 >n r. \u3008>n r.C\u3009\u2191 < min{\u03bb,C} Ic .\nIn contrast to the reductions for finitely valued G\u00f6del FDLs [Bobillo et al., 2009; Bobillo et al., 2012], the size of red(O) is always polynomial in the size of O. The reason is that we do not translate the concepts occurring in the ontology recursively, but rather introduce a polynomialsized subontology red(C) for each relevant subconcept C. Moreover, we do not need to introduce role hierarchies for our reduction, since the value of role connections is expressed using the special element \u03bb. EXPTIME-completeness of concept satisfiability in classical ALCQ [Schild, 1991; Tobies, 2001] now yields the following result.\nTheorem 3. Local consistency in G-IALCQ is EXPTIMEcomplete."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions", "text": "Using a combination of techniques developed for infinitely valued G\u00f6del extensions of ALC [Borgwardt et al., 2014] and for finitely valued G\u00f6del extensions of SROIQ [Bobillo et al., 2009; Bobillo et al., 2012], we have shown that local consistency in infinitely valued G-IALCQ is EXPTIME-complete. Our reduction is more practical than the automatabased approach proposed by Borgwardt et al. [2014] and does not exhibit the exponential blowup of the reductions developed by Bobillo et al. [2009; 2012]. Beyond the complexity results, an important benefit of our approach is that it does not need the development of a specialized fuzzy DL reasoner, but can use any state-of-the-art reasoner for classical ALCQ without modifications. For that reason, this new reduction aids to shorten the gap between efficient classical and fuzzy DL reasoners.\nIn future work, we want to extend this result to full consistency, possibly using the notion of a precompletion as introduced in [Borgwardt et al., 2014]. Our ultimate goal is to provide methods for reasoning efficiently in infinitely valued G\u00f6del extensions of the very expressive DL SROIQ, underlying OWL 2 DL. We believe that it is possible to treat transitive roles, inverse roles, role hierarchies, and nominals using the extensions of the automata-based approach developed originally for finitely valued FDLs in [Borgwardt and Pe\u00f1aloza, 2013; Borgwardt and Pe\u00f1aloza, 2014; Borgwardt, 2014].\nAs done previously in [Bobillo et al., 2012], we can also combine our reduction with the one for infinitely-valued Zadeh semantics. Although Zadeh semantics is not based on t-norms, it nevertheless is important to handle it correctly, as it is one of the most widely used semantics for fuzzy applications. It also has some properties that make it closer to the classical semantics, and hence become a natural choice for simple applications.\nA different direction for future research would be to integrate our reduction directly into a classical tableaux reasoner. Observe that the definition of red(C) is already\nvery close to the rules employed in (classical and fuzzy) tableaux algorithms (see, e.g. [Baader and Sattler, 2001; Bobillo and Straccia, 2009]).

In this paper, we extend previous decidability results for G-IALC to deal also with qualified number restrictions.
