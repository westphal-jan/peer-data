Search engines index and categorize web pages according to their contents using crawlers and rank them accordingly. For given user query they retrieve millions of webpages and display them to users according to web-page rank. Every search engine has their own algorithms based on certain parameters for ranking web-pages. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is that technique by which webmasters try to improve ranking of their websites by optimizing it according to search engines ranking parameters.\nIt is the aim of this research to identify the most popular SEO techniques used by search engines for ranking web-pages and to establish their importance for indexing and categorizing web data. The research tries to establish that using more SEO parameters in ranking algorithms helps in retrieving better search results thus increasing user satisfaction.\nIn the accomplished research, a web based Meta search engine is proposed to aggregates search results from different search engines and rank web-pages based on new page ranking algorithm which will assign heuristic page rank to web-pages based on SEO parameters such as title tag, Meta description, sitemap etc. The research also provides insight into techniques which webmasters can use for better ranking their websites in Google and Bing.\nInitial results has shown that using certain SEO parameters in present ranking algorithm helps in retrieving more useful results for user queries. These results generated from Meta search engine outperformed existing search engines in terms of better retrieved search results and high precision.\n4 Table of content\nList of Figures

This has already changed the way people socialize, do business, entertain themselves and use it for finding information (Berners-Lee and Fischetti, 2000). The tremendous growth and amorphous nature of the Web makes it hard for users to find relevant information. Evolution of search engines changed the way user interacts with the web. Users rely on search engines for extracting relevant information from among enormous data on the web (Berman and Katona, 2011). This trend has made search engines as information-seeking vehicle and online advertisement medium. Search engines index web-pages and categorize them according to its content. For any user query, search engines returns millions of results, ranked according to their ranking parameters (Evans, 2007). According to Jansen and Spink (2006, cited in Evans, 2007) 73% users never look beyond first page of search results. This has resulted in websites competing for higher rank in search engines.\nIn order to achieve higher ranking in search engine results, webmasters use certain techniques for optimizing their websites, known as SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO can be defined as an art which helps websites to be more visible to search engines. Understanding those factors which influence page ranking of search results is crucial for webmasters/developers (Evan, 2007). Although the market of SEO has crossed million dollar mark, not much research is done in this area (Berman and Katona, 2011; Gupta and Aggarwal, 2012). A study conducted by (Pringle et al., 1998) suggests the use of certain SEO parameters to improve web-page ranking in search engines. Clay (2005) in his paper claims Pringle\u2019s study to be \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018inexplicit\u2019 for new era of search engines. In another research (Berman and Katona, 2011) do conclude that, using SEO improves the search engine\u2019s ranking and its user\u2019s satisfaction but\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 3\ntheir approach was based on Black Hat1 techniques. The main motivation of this research is to analyse those White Hat2 SEO techniques which is useful in indexing and categorising web data, hand out these techniques to webmasters for better optimizing their websites and develop a Meta search engine for the company (Abster-iT) which uses these techniques for providing better results to users query. The focus of this paper is on white hat SEO techniques, which will be plainly called SEO throughout the paper."}, {"heading": "1.2 Research Aims and Objective", "text": "The undertaken research tries to find important SEO techniques used for ranking result pages by search engine; how they are important in indexing and categorizing web-data and by using them, optimize search results from search engine: Google and Bing, to show their importance in generating better results to user query.

Some research focuses on using Meta search engines for understanding optimization parameters. Resource materials from interviews and online lectures helped in finding some relevant SEO methods. Practical work is conducted in two Steps: Step 1 aimed to find SEO techniques used by search engines for indexing, categorizing and ranking webpages. Step 2 involves designing and implementing Meta search engine which collects search results from Google and Bing search engines. These results are then merged and ranked using page ranking algorithm which is trained to rank optimized3 webpages higher in ranking.\nAs part of experiment, 50 students were selected from university library and asked to use Google, Bing and iral Meta search engine for same \u2018query4\u2019 and rate their performance5.

These are powerful tools used to assist the users to find the information in a large pool of data in World Wide Web (Dreilinger and Howe, 1997). According to Beigi et al.1998, Explosive growth of world wide web resulted in motivation of development of search engines to assist the users for finding desired information from pool of unmanageable data. Search engines presents information in real time by using numerous algorithms and are thus better than web directories; which stores information in databases and match query for retrieving results. Some popular search engines are Google, Yahoo, Bing, MSN and Alta Vista.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 6"}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Evolution", "text": "In the early years when World Wide Web was relatively small finding information on the internet was done by using Web-directories. By 1990\u2019s it was observed that human powered categorization model was insufficient for faster and better search in World Wide Web (Metaxas, 2009). As elaborated in (Bowmen, 1994) Archie; the first ever search engine created by Alan Emtage, 1990; index files and menu name of FTP by using script based information gatherer. This system supports only name based searches by matching user query to its database. Other models developed were Veronica, which suffers from same problem of indexing. It served the same purpose as Archie while working on plain text file working for Gopher (Weiss, et al., 1996). These early developments of search engines focused mainly on its ability to index web resources and retrieve the best results for users query. Studies on web search engines were small and publications like (Wildstrom, 1995; Shirky, 1995; Taubes, 1995) are descriptive in nature.\nWith the introduction of web crawlers, the World Wide Web Worm (McBryan, 1994) indexing of documents becomes effective and efficient. The WWWW was used to index the URLs and HTML files; using title string. By 1996, Infoseek and Lycos search tools make huge collection of documents by indexing WWW; allowing users to search using keyword-based queries (Gauch, Wang and Gomez, 1997). With emergence of Google (Brin and Page, 1998) led new standards in search engines. The unique way of ranking retrieved page increases its quality.\nSearch engines has received good attention lately (Funkhouser et al., 2003;\nCohen et al., 2003; Strohman et al., 2004; Theobald and Weikum, 2002; Lei\net al., 2006; Bajracharya et al., 2006; Ferragina and Gulli, 2008; Horowitz and Kamvar, 2010; Hogan et al., 2011) describes about new algorithms to search dynamic web pages, 3d objects and images.\nFuzzy logic based experimental search engines are described in (Widyantoro and Yen, 2001; Liu et al., 2006; Aquin and Motta, 2011). Wolfram Alpha are\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 7\nnew generation answer engines which performs computation using information retrieval and NLP to answer the query rather than providing list of documents (Gray, 2012)."}, {"heading": "2.2.3 Classification", "text": "According to Lin, Tang and Chun (2011), search engines can be classified in three categories; robot based, directory based and Meta search engines; according to information collection and service deliverably. Robot based search engines use software robots to collect and index web sites, download documents in their databases having large indexes. Upon receiving a query they search their database to generate results relevant to query. Examples are Infoseek (1994), Alta Vista and WebCrawler. Directory based search engines organize resources in tree structured directories sorted according to subject area. They collect information by artificial based or by the authors of the websites. Meta search engines are based on multiple individual search engines to extract the data."}, {"heading": "2.2.4 Limitations", "text": "Size of internet and its exponential growth (Gebert et al., 2012) has makes it impossible for any single search engine to index more than 1/3rd of \u2018index able\u2019 web (Information retrieval on internet).

The purpose of creating a Meta search engine is to save lot of time by initiating a search which can be processed by different search engines simultaneously thus saving lot of time in studying different search engines, generating broad range of results (Mahabhashayam and Singitham, 2). The idea of developing a Meta search engine due to the fact that World Wide Web is a huge unstructured corpus of information which can be really difficult to index the web-pages for research. Incorporating various search engines such as Google, MSN and Bing under one Meta search engine helps to cover a large portion of World Wide Web, satisfying goals of maximizing search quality and minimizing resource consumption (Zilberstein, 1995 cited in Dreilinger and Howe, 1997). Other important factor is web-crawling, process used by search engines to index websites in their databases. Web-crawling is a long and expensive process (Menczer et al., 2001). Both storage cost of the database and time frame is important factors in it. As the content of websites keep changing from time to time thus keeping the updated information is rigid. Meta Search engine thus helps to eradicate this problem of crawling and indexing.

The concept of Meta search engine came from All-in-one Search page (Cross, 1996) in which users has to select search engines from pool of Search engine\u2019s. Using intelligent agents to retrieve search results were discussed in (Balabanovic et al., 1995; Knoblock et al., 1994; Chen and Liu, 2005). Selecting most promising search engine for information retrieval, SavvySearch (Dreilinger, 1996) was developed in which, query was send parallel to 2-3 search engines but results displayed were not merged. Neural network based intelligent Meta search engines (Gauch et al., 1996; Shu and Kak, 1999; Mahabhashyam and Singitham, Tadpole; Hamdi, 2011). The ProFusion System (Gauch et al., 1996) supports automatic and manual query dispatching, combing several features of other Meta search engines. Experimental Meta search engines focus on system architecture such as sorting algorithms (Huang et al., 2000) and adaptive behaviour (Fan and Gauch, 1999).\nWork of Aslam and Montague (2001) uses two models of Meta search engine. Their study was based to enhance the performance of Metasearch engines using two different algorithms, Borda-fuse and Bayes-fuse. ProThes (Braslavaski et al., 2004) revamped the design of Metasearch engine by including a thesaurus component.\nThere are various Meta search engines available on the internet, categorized as following:\n1.

It essentially involves in providing a higher ranking in search results when a user submit related query to search engines. This ranking is essential for generating higher traffic to the web-sites. As online search engines are popular tools for discovering information on the web, this has created new form of advertisement i.e. online ads.\nSearch engines generate their revenue from advertisement and sponsored links. To accommodate advertisers, search engine usually divide their result pages into organic and a sponsored part. These sponsored links are costly and not every website owner can bid for it. In order to gets a higher page ranking from among millions of websites, owners/developers of websites need to invest time in organic listing (Rutz and Bucklin, 2007). The collection of techniques for improving the organic rank of websites is called as search engine optimization (Berman and Katona, 2011). There are two type of SEO techniques mentioned in Kisiel, (2010) White hat SEO and Black hat SEO. Improving site content and user satisfaction comes under white hat techniques, while black hat techniques are used to increase the ranking of websites by eliciting external linking. Search engines are very cautious about SEO techniques and have special guidelines, failing which they remove sites from search results (Fortunato et al., 2006)."}, {"heading": "2.4.2 Previous Work", "text": "Most of the research is based on economic aspects of search engine optimization.

The benefit of SEO techniques for\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 11\ngenerating the volume of traffics to company sites and thus increasing revenue was proposed by (Kisiel, 2010). Research by (Berman and Katona, 2011) concluded that, some level of SEO can be useful for search engines as it make it easy for indexing and categorizing web-sites thus providing better results to consumers. Article by (Joran et al., 2010) proposes the idea of academic search engine optimization (ASEO). It proposed new techniques to optimize scholarly literature for Google Scholar and other academic search engines. Analysing search engines ability to identify relevant websites using robust and quality algorithms and optimizing web-sites were achieved in experiments by (Xing and Lin, 2006).\nSome old studies on ranking search results using regression analysis and decision tress from search engines like AltaVista, Excite, InfoSeek and Lycos were conducted by (Pringle et al., 1998). Their study concludes using keywords, Meta fields, informative titles, headings and Meta text as important factors for ranking in search results. This study is quite old and most of the search engines are out of business (Clay, 2005). In other study by (Bifet et al., 2005) they used different factors for their ranking functions using SVM and compared their ranking with actual Google results for particular keywords, ex. \u2018Art\u2019. The results highlighted other factors for ranking the websites in Google, moreover there SVM did not work and queries were arbitrary in nature (Evans, 2007). Using simple linear regression on predicting absolute PageRank (Khaki-Sedigh and Roudaki, 2003; Fortunato et al., 2006) were conducted. Factors such as number of in-bound link (also known as backlink, referencing between web-sites) for PageRanking were done in Fortunato et al. (2006).\nSome commercial studies conducted by SEO firms (Seoconsult.com, SearchEngineWatch.com, HighRanking.com, etc.), have partial knowledge of all the factors responsible for SEO.

Keywords are important and essential for optimization of any web-site (Viney, 2008). A thorough research for keywords should be done before choosing a domain name as it accounts for 20% of SEO efforts (Viney, 2008). According to (Jones, 2010 p.14) it is the first step for optimization and arguably the most important one. An effective keyword is one which has less competition (no. of websites having same keyword) and high volume (number of search for a particular keyword over a period of time) of search. Keywords can either be head terms (one or two words with high search volume) or tail terms (three or more words with less search volume) (Jones, 2010 p.16). As an example, \u2018computer\u2019 is a head term; keyword \u2018cheap computer for student\u2019 is considered as a tail term.\nGoogle suggestion tools are useful for finding the density of any keywords and its global search volume (Clifton, 2012 pp.12). Different other tools; Compete.com for analysing keyword competition, Keywordspy.com for keyword research on pay-per-click basis, Wordtracker.com for keyword suggestion are mentioned in (Jones, 2010 pp.14-35)."}, {"heading": "2.4.3.2 On-page optimization", "text": "These are the techniques which are implied on websites/web-pages for optimization.

It is the first element to get crawled by SE\u2019s (Odom and Lynell, 2012 pp.23-28). Google use page title in its result page as a summary. It is written in HTML as, <title> content goes here</title>\nTitle tag in homepage may contain the business/website name. There is no limit in title tag length but according to World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards, length should not increase more than 64 characters including spaces.\nb) Meta Keywords: They are used to define the content of a web-page. They provide bunch of keywords specific to sites content. Most search engines (Google, Yahoo) penalize for abusing its use. They are widely used to provide synonyms to title tags (Odom and Lynell, 2012).\nSyntax: <meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"keyword1, keyword2, keyuword3\">\nc) Meta Description: These tags are used to describe web-pages in a short plain language text.

In related experiment conducted by (Brin and Page, 1998) it took 9 days for indexing 26 million pages at an average 48.5 pages/second and using 3 crawlers at one time. Developing and training of web crawler take long time.\nIndexing- For indexing this large amount of data, major data structure is needed. Problem like disk seek and is common in large databases. Normalization of data units is must as crawler can crawl same content twice. Sorting and removing duplicate is another major concern.\n9 A type of query language to select nodes from XML documents.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 32\nSpam- Web crawlers often index spam web-pages which results in duplicate unwanted data.

Meta search engines like Helios (Gulli, 2005) and Tadpole (Mahabhashyam and Singitham, 2004) used dynamic search selector. In present model a dynamic search selector can be integrated after query processor, to send query to appropriate search engine.\nLimitation: Using dynamic engine selector requires training particular set of data which requires additional time.

In literature review it was noted that search engine optimization is a broad branch of science with little research conducted. Many deficiencies were highlighted such as; how to use SEO in effective manner, what parameters are important in optimizing, relation between SEO and information retrieval. Most of the literature gives a vague idea of SEO techniques and fails to relate its importance to search engines. This art of SEO came to existence after Google rolled out from Stratford University lab and became a market leader in search business. Larry and Page (1998) uses new methods and approaches to retrieve information from clustered web. This was the beginning of new area of science in information retrieval namely SEO.\nMain aim of SEO is to help search crawler for finding relevant information on the web. This helps in generic indexing and categorizing of web-pages which helps user to find relevant information using search engines. Other researcher used methods like developing Meta search engine for better performance of user query. Different Meta search engines are developed to this date for generating results based on user preferences, location and using click through data. On the other hand research on SEO only focuses on ranking web pages higher in search engines. They failed to relate the importance of SEO in information retrieval for search engines.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 56\nIn above research, researcher developed useful insight about working of search engines, way they index and categorize data from WWW and presents data to user\u2019s query using information retrieval methods. Experiments produced in this research show the importance of SEO for not only marketing purpose but its effectiveness in information retrieval."}, {"heading": "5.3 Evaluation of Experiments and Results", "text": "Main objective of conducting experiment was to highlight the importance of search engine optimizing techniques in search engines. SEO is always considered as an art for ranking websites higher in search engines result page. Experiments conducted in this research have shown its importance not only in ranking but its significance in categorizing web-pages.\niral Meta search engine is developed to extract information from existing search engines, Google and Bing and display results based on search engine optimizing parameters. Results from this Meta search engine when compared to users query shows significant findings. It was noted that web-pages those were optimized precisely were indexed by both search engines and categorized according to searched term meaning. These web-pages contain useful information about user\u2019s search query. Analysis of this results shows that iral Meta search engine outperformed Google and Bing with high precession rate of 0.43.\nThe above experiment also provides important SEO techniques used by search engines. In a comparison it was seen both search engine has its own priorities for SEO factors. This factors affects in indexing and ranking of websites thus for same search query search engines displays different results. From analysis of results it can be rightly said that SEO factors (mostly meta data, keywords) are not only important for ranking of web-pages but also plays important role in categorizing web data.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 57"}, {"heading": "5.4 Evaluation of Dissertation Objectives", "text": "All the objectives of this dissertation are successfully met.

There were certain limitations in this dissertation. The design of iral Meta search engine includes Google and Bing API for generating results. It has limitations of 100 queries per day. Due to limitation of time, only 10 results from Google and Bing search were analysed. Precision and Recall of iral Meta search is high based on first 10 results analysis. Only two query terms were included in experiments. For manual results a batch of 50 students was selected and asked to rank search engines. Every individual has its own preferences and understanding. Results may vary if a large user base is involved. The set of best SEO parameters is designed after analysing small fraction of World Wide Web.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 58"}, {"heading": "5.7 Area of Improvement", "text": "There are certain limitations in this research mentioned above. To start with, design of Meta search engine can be more efficient and effective if written in object oriented programming language. For finding results more number of keywords should be included. For analysing data and training for search results parameters more time should be allocated in this section.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 59"}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Recommendation", "text": ""}, {"heading": "6.1 Conclusion", "text": "The initial objective of this dissertation was to identify important search engine optimizing techniques used by webmasters to increase ranking of websites in search engine result page. The research question for this dissertation was raised in a study by (Pringle et al., 1998) on the importance of SEO techniques in ranking search engines results. Another study by (Berman and Katona, 2011) uses black hat SEO methods and suggests it does increase page rank of websites and users satisfaction. There are two types of SEO techniques: Black hat methods and White hat methods. This research is based on the study of white hat SEO techniques.\nIn order to answer the research question and breaking new finding, number of objectives and milestone were acknowledged making sure the research remains on right track. Initial steps include interviewing website developers and using web-mining techniques to identify search engine optimizing techniques.\nAs part of this dissertation, an intelligent Meta search engine (namely, iral) is developed which aggregate results from two search engines, Google and Bing. To understand the importance of SEO factors, webpages form this Meta search engine are ranked according to certain SEO parameters using a new ranking algorithm.\nExperimental results have proved that iral Meta search engine with average precision of 0.48 has outperformed Google (0.44) and Bing (0.31) search engines. Initial results were promising and findings revealed that search engine optimization is useful in categorizing web data effectively and ranking based on these parameters can achieve results more beneficial for user query thus increasing user satisfaction.\nThe iral Meta search engine is online for users and there is interesting possibility for learning lifetime. The system will improve over the time and interactive feedbacks from user will help in future changes.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 60\nInterestingly, it was observed that high level of web-page optimization is useful when search algorithms of search engines are less accurate.\nThis research has also addressed important SEO techniques and their weightage in indexing and ranking webpages by Google and Bing search engines. This finding will help webmasters and developers for better optimizing their websites for search engines, ultimately increasing their ranking. Results also provides important recommendation to webmasters that optimization to certain level helps website ranking and indexing but using black hat SEO techniques may cause webpage been banned from search engines."}, {"heading": "6.2 Recommendation and Future Work", "text": "It was observed in the research that SEO techniques are not only important in website ranking but it plays a vital role in its indexing and categorizing web data. The use of SEO can be helpful in field of information retrieval. Although this research has given a vague idea of using SEO for information retrieval, new research can aim for working in this field. A web crawler can be designed which can extract information from websites and rank them according to optimizing factors discussed in this research.\nOn the other note the design of iral Meta search engine can be improved by connecting more search engines to it. Design can include a dynamic engine selector which can aim to select search engines specific to user query. Such as for video it can select YouTube and Blinkz, for file search Torrent and Google. This will help in generating more specific results to user queries. iral Meta search engine can motivate the design of other Meta search engines and can develop them using new techniques (like changing retrieval function) by relating what have been achieved in this study.\nOther research can include optimizing websites using SEO factors presented in this research. This will help to understand the ever-changing ranking strategies of search engines.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 61"}, {"heading": "7 References", "text": " Aslam, J.

System Request Form: Date: March 1st, 2012\nProject Name: iral Meta search engine Is it a New System: Yes Development Time Limit: 1 Months 2 weeks Proposer/Customer: Abster-it, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Project Supervisor: Prof. Alamgir Hossain, Professor of Computer Science, Northumbria University, UK Project Developer: Jai Manral, Northumbria University, Newcastle, UK Business need: Web search engines have gained the title of most useful and high profile resources available on the internet. The market capital of web search engines has risen to billions of dollars. Products Details: A web based Meta search engine which aims to provide better searching experience to users and capture the web search market in United Kingdom. Main Functionality: The proposed meta-search engine, iral, solves the problem of manually searching different web based search engines for finding relevant data by providing a central place and interface where users can search several search engines at once. This benefits users by saving them time from having to individually learn and visit multiple search engines. By means of this model, the meta-searcher can map users' queries into specific sources more accurately, and it can achieve good precision and recall. Moreover, it will benefit the selection of target source and computing priority. Because new search engines emerge frequently and old ones are updated when their function and content change, the data model needs good adaptivity and scalability to keep in step with the rapidly developing World Wide Web. Other key features:\n\u2022 Ability to access a cross section of results from several search engines. \u2022 The ability to access multiple databases provides the most up-to-date\nresults. \u2022 No need of indexing the web. \u2022 No need of maintaining a database.\nExpected Value: Tangible Benefit \u2022 Provide 24/7 access to the system from any location using internet. \u2022 Provide easy access to users for searching the web. \u2022 Provide relevant results from multiple search engines. \u2022 Enhance the user experience of searching the web. \u2022 Financial gain for Abster-it and Developer (Jai Manral) Intangible Benefit \u2022 Increase university\u2019s reputation and can help in developing new ideas and projects.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 2\n\u2022 Allow the developers to increase their development skills \u2022 Helps in future research in areas like meta search engine, information retrieval, page\nranking and SEO. Special issues or constraints: \u2022 Must finish by 20th April, 2012 \u2022 Failure in meeting deadline may causes discontinuation of the project and funding. Deliverables: 1. Requirement, design and quality assurance documents. 2. Working solution with all components completed and tested. Timeline: \u2022 7-10 days for planning \u2022 1 weeks for analysis \u2022 2 weeks for design \u2022 2 weeks for implementation IPR: Abster-iT, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK\nDelivery date of 1st phase for testing: 16th April, 2012\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 3\n2. Problem Description:\nThe extraordinary growth of the internet has made it difficult, if not impossible, for search engines to keep up with its immense size and pace. Thus far, the major search engines have only been able to index a fraction of all the data that is available on the internet. Therefore, chances of finding relevant search results occasionally fails if users rely on only one search engine. Thus, the key to effective internet searching is not to rely on one, but rather on multiple search engines.\nHowever, it can be time consuming and tedious to individually visit and perform a search on multiple search engines.\n3. System Objectives and Advantages:\n3.1 System Objectives:\nA Meta search engine (MSE) is a search engine that collects results from other search engines, and then presents a summary of that information as the results of a search. The MSE iral is a Web service that offers such functionality. In practice, one can adopt different approaches to achieve the same goal; one could build a unique Web service that fulfils all tasks and does everything. With a smaller granularity, iral Meta search engine is a service for each search engine and an extra one that will use all the other to retrieve the results and compile them.\nUsability: The system is a cloud based application which can be easily accessible from any location just using the internet connection. The application can be used using the smartphones and other electronic pads.\nFunctionality: The system is easy to use. Users can go directly to systems web-domain, there is no login id or password required for searching. The user interface is simple; a text box is displayed for users to enter their quires.\nSecure: Security of the data is an important aspect and this system will be capable of keeping the data safe and secure from the unauthorized personals.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 4\nTransparency: This system provides transparency of"}, {"heading": "8.1 3.2 System Advantages:", "text": "Meta search engine iral accept users query, and send it out to multiple search engines in parallel. It is quite fast, using private \"backdoor\" servers made available by the search engines they query. There are several advantages to using iral Meta search engine; most obvious advantage is that user can get results from multiple search engines without having to visit each in turn. Apart from the time savings, it gives search a broader scope, since each individual search engine's index differs from all others.\n\u2022 Querying multiple engines simultaneously. \u2022 Broader overview of a topic. \u2022 Helps in optimizing the time spent on searching the web for\ninformation. \u2022 It eliminates user chances of missing out the information on various\nother regular search engines when user is accessing only one of them. \u2022 The Meta search gives a quicker view of the high ranking results in search engines. \u2022 Eliminating duplicate results also saves time.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 5\n4.

Conclusion\nMeta-search engines, also known as multiple search engines, metasearchers, or metacrawlers, are special search tools that present the results by accessing multiple search engines and web directories. This way, they allow users to quickly receive combined results that are merged in one place at once. Thus, web users neither need to type the query several times nor have to access every single search engine by themselves. This job will be done for the users by meta-search engines, which might additionally suggest engines that the user had not considered before.\nBy performing a search query, meta-search engines transmit the typed terms simultaneously to multiple individual search engines. Multi-search engines don\u2019t do the crawling or maintain their own database like single search engines, but usually filter the results they found instead. Based on a specific algorithm, they eliminate duplicates and rank the results from their sources into a list. The list of collection will be displayed on the SERP, very similar to the search engines\u2019 results page that relies on the indices of other search engines.\nIn dependence on studies of Dogpile, findings show that within the four search engines Google, Yahoo Search, Bing and Ask overlap across their first results page was only 0.6% for a given query. On the contrary, each engine still finds a large amount of unique results search engines which means that they have a lack of duplication and each of them mostly don\u2019t see pages as equally important. In other words, the imputation that search engines are the same is a myth. Meta-search engines collect and thus, cover the best results of the sources, including overlap. This is crucial, since overlapped documents tend to be more relevant.\nThe economic feasibility given in this reports forecasts the financial benefits for Abster-iT in near future. It will be another service domain for the business which has chances for further development, can accrue a larger user base and attract online marketers.\nAppendix beginning from 2- 9\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 2\nAppendix 2: Application Codes\nGoogle API <script type=\"text/javascript\"> var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-31712426-1']); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']); (function() { var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Aim\nThe Aim of this research proposal is to analyse and implement the best techniques used in the search engine optimization for websites and to develop an information retrieval system using Meta search engine to see the optimization effects on the ranking of the websites in search engines using artificial fuzzy logics.\n2. Background"}, {"heading": "2.1 Motivation", "text": "In today\u2019s world online search engines plays a major role as source of information in the web for the users i.e. Consumers (Berman and Katona, 2011). Online search is ubiquitous and with the rise in the e-commerce the competition in the ranking, on the search engines has increased rapidly (Fuxue et al., 2011). With nearly 146 billion online searches every month, there is a high rise in the competition for websites to rank higher in the search engines. There are unlimited opportunities in this field but to take the advantage, it is important for the websites to rank higher in the search engines. In order for the websites to rank higher in the search results they need to follow some techniques which are known as Search Engine Optimization. As mentioned in (Frydenberg and Miko, 2011) SEO is the process of promoting a website so that it can be visible by the search engines.\nThere are various methods described for the optimization of the websites. As mentioned in (Fuxue et al., 2011) the SEO techniques are observed from four aspects: Structure of the web-pages, keywords used, content and links. There are other researchers which believe that keywords and back links are solely responsible for the ranking of the websites (Frydenberg and Miko, 2011). There are some researchers which focus mainly on the social networking (facebook, twitter) for the ranking of the websites (Chen et al., 2010). Malaga (2007) in his paper states that the keywords play the major role in the optimization techniques. The SEO techniques can be of two types which are the black hat techniques and the white hat techniques (Malaga, 2010). The purpose of this research is to find out the best white hat approaches and to rank them in order to their importance.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 70\nSearch engine from time to time generate the guidelines for the optimization but the process they adapt i.e. how they rank the optimization techniques is still not know.\nThe researcher of this project thus aims to find out the new techniques for optimizing the websites and the techniques used in ranking in search engine by using the artificial intelligence system. As there are different search engines available (Google, Yahoo, Bing, Microsoft) and each of them has different strategy of ranking the websites, (Hai et al., 2011), thus the researcher has planned to develop a Meta Search Engine, for the practical results for the experiment.\n2.2 Research Methods\nOnline businesses rely on search engines to generate traffic to their Web sites through the use of both organic and sponsored search results. (Frydenberg and Miko, 2011)\nAs (Stumme et al., 2006) stated that the enormous success of the search engine has make it necessary to improve the search ranks thus leading a competitive market and new challenges for the website optimizers to make their websites visible in the search results.\nSEO techniques requires an understanding of how exactly the search engines work and rank the pages for any particular keywords (Frydenberg and Miko, 2011).\nThere are various steps needed in order to make the study and achieve the desired the results:\nIn order to understand the optimization techniques the researcher of this report will create a set of the optimization techniques through vast study of the journals and data collected from the website development firms (Abster-iT and Portebella Rain Creative Design). The use of Web Mining is essential\nResearchers Meta Search Engine\nGoogleYahooBing\nDB DB DB\nShared Database\nquery response\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 71\nfor studying the optimization techniques. Web Mining according to (Stumme et al., 2006) can be sub divided in to three steps: Web Content Mining, Web Structure Mining and Web Content Mining. The researcher will undertake the web mining process in order to generate the techniques for optimization. The next step is to put these optimization techniques into the set, say Q, in the ranking order by using the fuzzy logics and neural networks.\nThe next step is to create the Meta Search Engine. The Meta search engine has been useful in the earlier experiments conducted by the researcher\u2019s such as Thorsten for their study of Optimizing Search Engines using Clickthrough Data. The point of using Meta search engine in this research is to get the best results from the various search engines such as Google, Yahoo, MSN and Bing, so that the research topic will not be based on the specific search engines optimization techniques. The other benefit of Meta search engine usage will be that the researcher will not have to develop the database and can cover the larger segment of the documents throughout the web (Joachims, 2002).\nNext step is to extract the data from Meta Search Engine and arrange them in the new ranking order using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It will be based on the non-linear ranking function and the parameters (ranks) of the vector will be based from the set Q, described earlier. As described in the Joachims (2002), the SVM algorithms are successfully used as ranking algorithm for the Meta search engine results. This will generate the new list of the refined web-pages according to the optimizing techniques.\nThe last step is to make the comparing of the resulted list to the list originated from the search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing) separately and find the ranking (optimizing) parameters they used for the information retrieval.\nThus the researcher will be able to find the best techniques needed to optimize the web-pages and improve their ranking in the search engines.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 72\n3. Objectives\nThe undertaken research tries to find important SEO techniques used for ranking result pages by search engine; how they are important in indexing and categorizing web-data and by using them, optimize search results from search engine: Google and Bing, to show their importance in generating better results to user query. It is important to achieve following objectives in order to accomplish the aim of this research:\n To find relevant literature from articles, web sources and interviews to understand the working of search engines, i.e. how they retrieve data from web, categorize them and present it to users.  To develop new ranking algorithm for retrieving better results to user query.  To demonstrate the weightage of those SEO factors important in optimizing websites and improve ranking in search engines result pages.  To develop an intelligent Meta search engine, this can retrieve better results than present search engines.  To help webmasters by providing important SEO techniques for their websites.\n4. Resources / Constraints\nAll the resources will be collected from the internet. The majority of the resources will be used from the research papers. For Web mining the detail study of the websites and the structure can be done using the internet and consulting to the Web-site Development firms (Abster-iT and Portobella Rain Creative Design). Creating of Meta search engine can be done on the software\u2019s provided by the university. This can be done on the computer labs at the Pandon Building. The Support Vector Machine and other fuzzy logics, including the neural networks can be designed in the Artificial Intelligence labs provided by the university.\nApart from the study materials the researcher needs to perform several interviews with the people who are in the business of websites. The researcher has therefore contacted some firms (Abster-iT and Portobella Rain Creative Designs) in and around the Newcastle for this purpose.\nIntelligent Search Optimization using Artificial fuzzy logic 2012\nJai Manral (10037359) Page 73\nThe major constrains of this research is that the field of optimization is vast and due to the limitation of the time it will be infeasible to obtain the perfect results. As the research is based on the United Kingdom thus, the search engines data which the researcher requires for this project will be extracted from the UK servers. This can alter the results if the same research is performed from different part of the world. There will be limitation for the \u2018keywords\u2019 to be used in search engines and the number of websites to be monitored.\n5. Research Ethics\nThe materials to be used for the purpose of the research are in public domains. There is no external ethical requirement for the research work. All the data collected from the internet can be used publically and no handling of the confidential data is required. The data to be collected from the Web Designing Firms (Abster-iT and Portobella Rain Creative Design) are not confidential and can be used for the research purposes. There is no risk/ harm to the research participants and the University to carry out this project. All the materials such as the survey and the questionnaire are to be kept safely after the study has been completed. This research does not include any study which might cause the misuse of the findings to the society in person or in World Wide Web.\n6.
