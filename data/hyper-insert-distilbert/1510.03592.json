Due to the massive wide spread of commercial WiFi-enabled devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.), the location of WiFi devices can be used to localize people who\nStefano Rosati and Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan have contributed equally to this paper.\nown those devices. Such localizations are important for many applications, e.g. to deliver a mail package using UAVs for companies such as Amazon and Google, to provide internet connectivity using UAVs for companies like Facebook, and perhaps most importantly, in search and rescue operations to localize victims.\nLocalization of people could potentially be performed using bird\u2019s-eye view camera mounted on a UAV, as discussed in Symington et al. [2010]. However, this approach is limited to situations where the targets are clearly visible from the camera. Furthermore, it requires a great amount of image processing to separate the desired target from other objects.\nOur approach is to localize WiFi devices measuring the received signal strength. As specified by the 802.11x standards, a mobile-station (MS) periodically broadcasts a management frame, called Probe Request Frame (PRF), to actively scan the environment and discover access points. A WiFi device operating in monitor1 mode can receive and decode PRFs, extracting the MAC addresses of the source and measuring the corresponding signal strength index (RSSI).\nThe use of RSSI for localization purposes is problematic because there is no obvious connection between the measured signal strength and the distance between the transmitter and the receiver Benkic et al. [2008], Zarimpas et al. [2006] and Jianwu and Lu [2009].\nHowever, some authors have shown that the RSSI can actually be used in real situations to perform an estimation of the relative positions between the source and the receiving device Saxena et al. [2008]. Methods using Gaussian Processes (GP) are suited for modeling RSSI, since they can capture non-linearity and quantify uncertainty over a large region Ha\u0308hnel and Fox [2006], Ferris et al. [2007], Fink and Kumar [2010].\nAs shown in Zarimpas et al. [2006], by combining the RSSIs measured by several monitor nodes appropriately placed in a certain area, one can estimate and\n1More specifically, in RFMON (Radio Frequency MONitor) mode.\nar X\niv :1\n51 0.\n03 59\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 4\nO ct\n2 01\n5\ntrack the position of the MS transmitting the frames. Such a method, however, is limited by the need of a large number of monitor nodes to cover large areas.\nIn this paper, we show that active sensing and exploitation using UAV results in a fast and accurate localization. Our approach is based on the fact that the expected value of an RSSI measurement increases as the distance decreases. The UAV therefore tries to get to a location where the expected value of the RSSI measurements is highest.\nSince collecting measurements is costly, both in terms of time and energy, we use the machine-learning method called Bayesian optimization. Such method allows the UAV to collect observations in informative locations to find the WiFi device quickly and with high accuracy. More importantly, in our application, the environment is unknown and such \u201cblack-box\u201d approach is appropriate since it avoids making assumptions about the environment. Our approach therefore is completely data-driven.\nFig. 1 summarizes our approach for locating a single WiFi device. In the beginning, the UAV does a quick scan of the area to get an initial number of measurements. Based on such measurements, the UAV computes an estimate of the distribution of the RSSI over the whole region. The UAV then decides to fly to a new location either to \u201cexploit\u201d, i.e., move to a location which is more likely to give higher RSSI measurements, or \u201cexplore\u201d, i.e., it goes to previously unexplored locations. This decision is taken using a\nBayesian optimization method. This process is repeated, i.e. as soon as a new measurement is made, the UAV moves to a new location either to exploit or to explore. The algorithm terminates when the confidence in our estimate is reasonable."}, {"heading": "2 Goals", "text": "Our primary goal is to localize multiple WiFi devices in a given region. For simplicity, we will discuss localization of a single device. An extension to multiple devices is presented in Section A.1. We will denote the true location of the device by xtrue in a region X .\nTo localize the device, the UAV flies over the region X hoping to receive a measurement from the device. The measurements are received at random times. Let us suppose that by the time t, we have received nt measurements with time-stamps t1, t2, . . . , tnt such that t1 < t2 < . . . < tnt < t. Denote by xti the location of the UAV when the i\u2019th measurement was made and by yti the corresponding RSSI measurement. Note that the RSSI measurement is a random process Y that depends on many factors such as the current position of UAV, the true location of the device and the time of measurement, but for notation simplicity we only show dependency w.r.t. the position of the UAV at time t, i.e. xt.\nTherefore, at any time t, we have a sequence of triplets: {ti,xti , yti} for i = 1, 2, . . . , nt such that ti < ti+1 < t. Denote the set of triplets at time t by Dt.\nWe will now discuss the characteristics of our data and the challenges associated with localization."}, {"heading": "3 Data Characteristics and Challenges", "text": "The main characteristics of our data is that the measurement\u2019s strength is on average highest around the transmitting device.\nFig. 2 shows the measurements gathered from a laptop (Sony Vaio Pro-13 ultrabook) during an exhaustive scan of the region that took more than 60 minutes. The device is located in the center of the figure, and the size and color of points are according to the signal strength.\nUnfortunately, localizing the peak is challenging due to the fact that the relation between the signal strength and the distance is stochastic.\nThis is because the measured signal strength is affected by noise, by the power of the transmitter, by the implementation of the receiver, and by the channel characteristic that include reflection, multipath scattering and shadowing. Therefore, at different distances, the\ndistribution of the RSSI is different (thus making the measurements heteroscedastic). This is shown in Fig. 3 where we plot the signal strength as a function of distance for two devices. We clearly see that the two devices follow completely different profiles.\nSecondly, since the device is non-collaborative and unaware of the localization, the measurements are received at random times. More importantly, the chance of missing a measurement increases with the distance. This is shown in Fig. 4 where we plot the measurements arrival rate 1/(ti+1\u2212ti) as a function of the distance from the device. Clearly, when we are close to the device, we get measurements more often compared to when we are far from it. Therefore, in our problem the missing-at-random Little and Rubin [1986], assumption is violated, making the problem challenging.\nFinally, in our scenario, X could potentially be large and therefore it is crucial to develop an algorithm that is capable of collecting measurements where they really matter. We need to make good decisions with very few measurements, otherwise we may end up performing an exhaustive scan of X which will defeat the whole purpose.\nAs a result of these issues, naive methods such as hillclimbing do not work for our problem. Such methods needs a very good estimate of the gradient, and such estimate would require far more measurements that the ones that we have."}, {"heading": "4 Our Approach", "text": "The UAV first performs a rough scan of the whole area looking for the an initial number of RSSI measurements. This initial phase, in our scenario, takes around 3 minutes. As soon as the initial phase is completed, it starts the process of localization in which it repeatedly performs the following tasks whenever a new measurement is received.\n1. Using the data Dt at time t, the UAV computes the (predictive) distribution p(y|x\u2217,Dt). This is the probability density function of the measurements y at the candidate locations x\u2217 \u2208 X given the past measurements Dt. Gaussian process regression is used for this purpose.\n2. Given the distribution, it decides whether to exploit or to explore based on the expected improvement function. This step is based on the Bayesian-optimization framework Brochu et al. [2010].\n3.

It is also particularly suited for our application for many reasons. Firstly, GP regression works well in small-sample setting which is desirable in our setting since in the beginning of the search we do not have a lot of data. Secondly, GP regression not only gives us predictions but also uncertainty associated with them, which helps us choose between exploration and exploitation (see more details in the next section). Finally, hyperparameters of GP regression can be set easily using maximum likelihood estimation, allowing for an easy implementation (see end of this section).\nIn this paper, we use a regression model that gives us a Gaussian distribution at each candidate location x\u2217. In this paper, we assume that the measurements are sampled from a jointly Gaussian distribution. We make this choice since it leads to a computationally simple algorithm which can be implemented on the on-board computer in the UAV. Our model therefore takes the following form:\nyt = ft + t, for t = t1, t2, . . . (1)\nwhere t are i.i.d. Gaussian noise t \u223c N (0, \u03c32) with variance \u03c32, while ft is drawn from a GP ft \u223c GP(m(x), k(x,x\u2032)) with mean function m and covariance function k. The relationship between y and x is captured with a specific mean and covariance function. In this paper, we use the zero mean function and a squared-exponential covariance function defined\nbelow:\nk(x,x \u2032 ) = \u03c32f exp [ \u2212 1 l2 (x\u2212 x \u2032 )T (x\u2212 x \u2032 ) ] (2)\nwhere \u03c3f , l \u2208 R are kernel hyperparameters that control the spatial correlation. We denote the set of hyperparameters by \u03b8 = {\u03c3, \u03c3f , l}.\nThe distribution p(y|x\u2217,Dt,\u03b8) at a candidate location x\u2217 is a Gaussian distribution. Denote the vector of measurements received until time t by yt = [yt1 , yt2 , . . . , ytnt ]\nT . It follows from the property of GPs that any finite number of samples drawn from GP are jointly Gaussian, giving the following expression for the distribution of yt and any y:[\nyt y\n] \u223c N ( 0, [ Kt + \u03c3\n2I k\u2217 kT\u2217 k\u2217\u2217 + \u03c3 2\n]) (3)\nwhere Kt is a matrix with (i, j)\u2019th entry as k(xti ,xtj ), k\u2217 is a vector with i\u2019th entry as k(xti ,x\u2217) and k\u2217\u2217 = k(x\u2217,x\u2217).\nWe can write the expression for the distribution of y given yt (see page 16 of Rasmussen and Williams [2006]):\np(y|x\u2217,Dt,\u03b8) := N (\u00b5\u2217|t, \u03c32\u2217|t) (4)\nwhere \u00b5\u2217|t := k T \u2217 (Kt + \u03c3 2I)\u22121yt (5)\n\u03c32\u2217|t := k\u2217\u2217 \u2212 k T \u2217 (Kt + \u03c3 2I)\u22121k\u2217 (6)\nThe computational complexity of these operations is O(n\u2217n 3 t ) where n\u2217 is the number of candidate locations. We limit the number of candidate locations to around n\u2217 = 350. The cubic cost can be reduced by using one rank updates. Nevertheless, this computation is acceptable in our application since we do not have to measure more than 300 measurements for the whole search operation.\nThe distribution p(y|x\u2217,Dt,\u03b8) depends on specification of \u03b8. We set \u03b8 offline using the data from a scan of the region (such as Fig. 2). Specifically, given a measurement vector y taken at locations X, we maximize log p(y|X,\u03b8). The expression for the log-likelihood is also available in closed-form. Please see Rasmussen and Williams [2006] for details."}, {"heading": "4.2 Deciding UAV\u2019s Next Location using Bayesian Optimization", "text": "We use the Bayesian optimization framework to decide the next location to visit. The decision in made based on the distribution N (\u00b5\u2217|t, \u03c32\u2217|t). Intuitively, the decision trades-off the two competing goals:\n1. The UAV should visit regions that are similar to regions where high RSSI measurements were observed. This is the exploitation step.\n2. The UAV should also visit unexplored regions that could also potentially give rise to high RSSI measurements. This is the exploration step.\nBayesian optimization takes these two goals into account by using an acquisition function Brochu et al. [2010]. In this paper, we use the expectedimprovement (EI) acquisition function which measures the expected improvement over the location where the last highest RSSI measurement was observed. Let \u00b5+ be the greatest mean value among those computed \u2200x \u2208 Dt. Then the EI function is defined as follows:\nEI(x\u2217) := Ep(y|x\u2217,Dt) [ max { 0, \u00b5\u2217|t \u2212 \u00b5+ }] (7)\nFor Gaussian predictive distribution, EI has a closedform expression:\nEI(x\u2217) = (\u00b5\u2217|t \u2212 \u00b5+)\u03a6(u) + \u03c3\u2217|t\u03c6(u) (8)\nwhere u := (\u00b5\u2217|t\u2212\u00b5+)/\u03c3\u2217|t and we assume that \u03c3\u2217|t > 0, \u03a6 and \u03c6 are cumulative distribution function and probability density function of the standard Gaussian respectively. When \u03c3\u2217|t is 0, we set EI to be zero as well. This equation shows that EI will be large under two circumstances: either the test location has a high mean value \u00b5\u2217|t or it has a high \u03c3\u2217|t. Clearly, the two scenarios correspond to exploitation and exploration respectively.\nUsing the distribution, we can compute an estimate of xtrue. We use for such estimate the x\u2217 for which \u00b5\u2217|t is maximum."}, {"heading": "4.3 Practical Issues", "text": "Initialization using a quick scan: In the initialization phase, the UAV flies with a predetermined trajectory.

In particular, we stop when a few successive predictions fall inside the same neighborhood of some predetermined radius \u03b4.\nMinor details about navigation: There are two minor details for task 2 specific to our set-up. Firstly, the UAV we used in our experiment does not exactly go to the new specified location, rather it flies in a circle around this location with a pre-defined radius. However, the location xt where measurements yt is received is the actual position of the UAV at time t. Secondly, having made a decision to move to a new location, the UAV does not make any new decisions until\nit reaches to the new location. New measurements received during the flight are added to the dataset and are used for future decisions."}, {"heading": "5 Details of UAV", "text": "We can distinguish two main types of small UAVs: rotary-blade (i.e. multi-copters) and fixed-wing. Multi-copters fly using the lift force generated by one or more blades (small UAVs have typically four blades, thus they are called quadricopters) They can take off and land vertically, and hover in the air. However, they are slow, particularly sensitive to the wind, and therefore unsuited to cover long distances. In order to cover a large search areas, we adopted fixed-wing UAVs, because they fly at higher speeds and with a higher energy efficiency compared to quadricopters.\nFor the experiments we used a fixed-wing UAV, named eBee, developed by SenseFly SenseFly. The vehicle\u2019s body is made of expanded polypropylene (EPP), and it has a single rear-mounted propeller powered by an electric motor. The eBee platform is illustrated in Fig. 5. It has an integrated autopilot capable of flying with winds up to 12 m/s, at a cruising speed of about 57 km/h, with an autonomy of 45 minutes.\nWe installed an ARM-based computer-on-module named Gumstix Overo Tide Gumstix on the rear compartment of the plane, where the localization algorithm runs. The computer runs a customized Linux distribution (kernel version 3.5.0) and it is connected with two 802.11 radio interfaces via USB, and with the autopilot via serial port. The first 802.11 interface is set in monitor mode to sniff PRFs. The second one is used to connect the UAV computer to our ground station. The Gumstix computer interacts with the onboard autopilot to fly the UAV over specific locations decided from the localization algorithm."}, {"heading": "6 Results", "text": ""}, {"heading": "6.1 Hyperparameter Estimation for GP", "text": "As discussed earlier, the chosen hyperparameters are those that maximize the log likelihood log p(y|X,\u03b8).

Figure 6 (right) shows the MSE between new samples and the mean value that follows from the chosen hyperparameters. The left side of Figure 6 shows the log likelihood. We can clearly see that the hyperparameters that maximize the log likelihood also give a very low value of MSE, justifying the choice."}, {"heading": "6.2 Real-Data Based Simulations", "text": "This section reports simulation results, based on real measurements. Our results suggest that the proposed method is able to localize the device with an average error of 50 meters within 5 minutes. Specifically, we simulate the following:\n1. The trajectory followed by the UAV during the localization process.\n2. The RSSI measurements.\n3. The random times at which the signals are emitted.\nThe details of the last two are explained in the next two paragraphs.\nThe RSSI measurements are sampled from an empirical distribution obtained from the real data show in in Figure 3. Specifically, the range between [0, 600] meters has been divided in 20 bins. For each bin, we have derived the corresponding empirical distribution. This distribution is used to draw a RSSI sample for any distance that falls into the bin.\nThe times at which PRFs are transmitted are selected independently. The intertransmittion interval is a random variable uniformly distributed in the interval [\u2206T \u2212 \u03b5max,\u2206T + \u03b5max].\nFigure 7 shows the average localization error and the standard deviation as a function of the time, obtained from 1000 independent runs of the algorithm.\nThese results suggest that within 5 minutes the UAV is able to reach within 100 meters of the device. This is a huge improvement over the time taken to do a full scan of the region, e.g. the scan of Figure 2 took around an hour. In 5 minutes one would typically get only 10 to 30 RSSI measurements. According to the figure the average error at this time is below 50 meters.\nFigure 8 shows the UAV\u2019s trajectory during 10 independent runs. The initial locations are shown by a circle while the end locations are shown with a triangle.

After having located the first device, the algorithm repeats the Bayesian driven search for each other target, while the initialization phase is performed only once at the beginning. During the localization of the first target, the UAV can potentially collect packets coming from any other target. Therefore the algorithm has an advantage when the estimation of the second target\u2019s location starts, because the dataset is already rich.\nTo improve the localization efficiency, we designed a specific variant of the algorithm to locate multiple devices. The idea is to fly the UAV in specific locations to collect measurements that can be useful for localizing all the M devices.

Our main motive is to localize humans by localizing their WiFi devices, e.g. during search-and-rescue operations after a natural disaster. We use an active sensing approach that relies on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to collect signal-strength measurements at informative locations. The problem is challenging since the measurement is received at arbitrary times and they are received only when the UAV is in close proximity to the device. For these reasons, it is extremely important to make prudent decision with very few measurements. We use the Bayesian optimization approach based on Gaussian process (GP) regression. This approach works well for our application since GPs give reliable predictions with very few measurements while Bayesian optimization makes a judicious trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In field experiments conducted over a region of 1000 \u00d7 1000 m, we show that our approach reduces the search area to less than 100 meters around the WiFi device within 5 minutes only. Overall, our approach localizes the device in less than 15 minutes with an error of less than 20 meters.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
