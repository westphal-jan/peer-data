This unit, also called marker, can either be a morpheme, a word or a phrase. Since similes rely on comparison, they occur in several languages of the world. Depending on the marker used and of the semantic or structural nuances it introduces, two main simile classifications have been proposed. From her study of images built on figures of resemblance in Baudelaire's poetry, Bouverot (1969) distinguishes between type I and type II similes. Whereas type I similes are denoted by a finite number of comparatives, prepositions or conjunctions which traditionally convey a comparison, type II similes are observed after a verb or an adjective which semantically contains the idea of similitude or difference. Leech and Short (2007) propose a stricter distinction and separate conventional similes of the form \u201cX is like Y\u201d from quasi-similes which revolve around all other linguistic constructions. This partition seems to take into account the fact that some simile markers are often preferred in a particular language. For example, \u201elike\u201f in English or \u201ecomme\u201f in French are often presented as the prototypical simile markers and are more frequently used than the other markers.\nSimiles play an important role in literary texts not only as rhetorical devices and as figures of speech but also because of their evocative power, their aptness for description and the relative ease with which they can be combined with other figures of speech (Israel et al. 2004). Detecting all types of simile constructions in a particular text therefore seems crucial when analysing the style of an author. Few research studies however have been dedicated to the study of less prominent simile markers in fictional prose and their relevance for stylistic studies. The present paper studies the frequency of adjective and verb simile markers in a corpus of British and French novels in order to determine which ones are really informative and worth including in a stylistic analysis. Furthermore, are those adjectives and verb simile markers used differently in both languages?"}, {"heading": "2 Adjective and verb simile markers", "text": "Comparison being a semantic construction, there exist no comprehensive and finite lists of verb and adjective simile markers. The choice of the adjective and verb simile markers used in this experiment has been based on their ability to introduce phrasal similes, i.e. similes in which the compared term is a common noun. As far as verb markers are concerned, were ignored impersonal constructions which only accept indefinite pronouns as subjects such as in the French sentence \u201cJ\u201faime sa voix, on e\u00fbt dit une pluie de grelots\u201d.\nUnder the category of verb simile markers, were included modified forms not found in the literature such as \u201ebe/become\u2026.kind/sort/type of\u201f and \u201everb+ less/more than\u201f as well as their respective French equivalents \u201e\u00eatre/devenir\u2026.esp\u00e8ce/type/genre/sorte de\u201f and \u201everb+ plus/moins que\u201f. As a matter of fact, even though expressions such as \u201ekind of\u201f or \u201esort of\u201f are often cited among metaphorical markers (Goatly 1997), they were judged not specific enough to explicitly introduce a comparison on their own. In the case of the comparison markers \u201eless than\u201f and \u201emore than\u201f, the issue rather lies in the fact that they are also used in other types of constructions and conjoining them to a verb form seems a good compromise to restrict their polysemy.\nIn English, in addition to adjectives conveying the idea of comparison, adjective simile markers include adjectives formed by adding the suffix \u201e-like\u201f and by joining a noun to an adjective of colour. Those two types of adjectives are particularly interesting stylistically speaking because they can potentially be used to create neologisms. Table 1 lists all the adjective and simile markers used for the experiment."}, {"heading": "3 Corpus building and extraction method", "text": "To extract simile candidates, digital versions of various literary texts were collected mainly from the Project Gutenberg website 1 and from the Biblioth\u00e8que \u00e9lectronique du Qu\u00e9bec 2 , for British and French novels respectively. Most of the novels included in the corpus were written during the 19 th century so as to ensure linguistic homogeneity and because that century witnessed the novel imposing itself as a predominant literary genre. By observing a ration of least 3 novels per writer, we were able to put together a corpus of 1191 British novels authored by 62 writers and a corpus of 746 French penned by 57 novelists\nEach corpus was tagged and chunked using TreeTagger, a multilingual decision tree part-ofspeech tagger and a syntactic chunker (Schmid, 1994). The output of the tagger was further used to determine sentence boundaries. Each extracted sentence is considered a simile candidate if it contains one of the marker immediately followed by a noun-headed noun phrase."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "Since similes are realised first and foremost within a sentence, simile frequency was first calculated by dividing the number of occurrences of each simile marker in a particular novel by the total number of sentences in that novel. That measure however proves itself to not accurately reflect the distribution of verb and adjective simile markers as their use seems to not be influenced by the length of the novel. The frequency of each simile marker concerned in this experiment is therefore measured only by counting its occurrence in a specific novel.\nDue to their polysemous use and the noise they introduce in the generated data, markers such as \u201eremind of\u201f and \u201erappeler\u201f were not considered in the final analysis.\nThe discrepancy between the frequency count of each grammatical category in English and French tends to suggest that both languages work differently as far as simile creation is concerned. In English, verb simile markers appear to be more used than adjective ones. As a matter of fact, two main verb constructions largely surpass the other markers in number: the structures \u201eseem\u201f + NP and \u201ebe/become a sort/type/kind of...\u201f + NP which count more than 5,000 occurrences.\nExcluding adjectives formed by using \u201e-like\u201f or an adjective of colour as a suffix, \u201eakin (to)\u201f is the most used adjective simile marker with about 350 occurrences and is generally associated with nouns\n1 www.gutenberg.org 2 beq.ebooksgratuits.com\ndenoting feelings.\nAs far as French is concerned, the gap between the use of adjective and verb simile markers is less pronounced. Like its English counterpart, \u201esembler\u201f has a good place among most frequently used verb markers but is less predominant than \u201eressembler (\u00e0)\u201f. French writers also distinguish themselves by their preference for introducing similes with the adjectives \u201epareil (\u00e0)\u201f and \u201esemblable (\u00e0)\u201f .\nIn addition, in the French corpus, \u201esimilaire (\u00e0)\u201f is never used as a typical simile marker, just like 'identical (to)' in the British corpus. If \u201eidentique (to)\u201f appears in the French corpus, it has the smallest number of occurrences of all adjectives that are effectively used to create similes. Similarly, the inflected forms of \u201ecomparable\u201f are found in both corpora but are not so common. A possible explanation as Bouverot (1969) suggests could be the length of the word \u201ecomparable\u201f which surely affects the sentence rhythm.\nFrom the results of this experiment, it is possible to conclude that there seems to exist preferred verb and adjective simile markers in fictional prose. However, even though some writers use them systematically\u2014for example all texts by Balzac present in the corpus contain at least one occurrence of \u201epareil \u00e0 + NP\u201f\u2014the frequency use of these markers in those authors\u201f novels generally vary greatly from one text to another. Consequently, even though verb and adjective simile markers could be interesting stylistic indicators, taken individually, they do not seem to be able to characterise unequivocally one author\u201fs style but rather hint at a possible group tendency or an aesthetic idiosyncrasy."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work was supported by French state funds managed the ANR within the Investissements d'Avenir programme under the reference ANR-11IDEX-0004-02."}], "references": [{"title": "Comparaison et m\u00e9taphore", "author": ["D.
