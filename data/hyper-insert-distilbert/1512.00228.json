The solutions to a large number of real world problems may be modelled by clusterings. Also, clustering is commonly used as an auxiliary task in many fields, e.g. wireless sensor networks [21], speech recognition [25], stochastic optimization [18], data compression [12], document organization, etc. In traditional clustering, the feature space on which objects are represented is determined off-line, and the representation of every object for performing the clustering method is determined on this feature space. In the last decades, a generalization of the traditional\nclustering task, called biclustering1, has emerged. The underlying idea of biclustering is to collaboratively find adequate subspaces of features, in terms of which meaningful, high quality clusters may be discovered. A variety of biclustering algorithms have been proposed. We can find surveys about this topic in [20, 23, 24, 26, 37]. Biclustering has been applied in a wide range of problems, such as image segmentation [36], face clustering [17], image compression [19], genome expression data [5], etc. Cluster validation is the field of study dealing with the methodologies aiming to asses the quality of the results of a clustering algorithm, which we refer to as candidate clustering. The quality of a candidate clustering is assessed via one or several evaluation measures, which are expected to yield optimum scores for high quality candidate clusterings and farfrom-optimum scores for poor candidate clusterings, as well as comparable scores for two or several comparable candidate clusterings. Validation criteria are divided into internal, external or relative. Relative validation measures choose the best results of multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with different parameters, whether these results have been obtained by means of an internal or external measure. Internal validation measures assess the quality of a candidate clustering by analyzing exclusively the group structure and/or the objectto-object, object-to-cluster and cluster-to-cluster relations observed in it, whereas external validation measures compare the candidate clustering to an ideal clustering, also called gold standard. The gold standard is assumed to describe the correct clustering, i.e. the one that best fits the real world structure of the collection, and is usually the result of a manual annotation process conducted by one, or (desirably) several, human specialists. In the context of external evaluation measures, it is common to use the term cluster only to refer to the clusters in the candidate clustering, whereas the clusters in the gold standard are called classes, categories, or hidden clusters. For uniformity, throughout this work we will use the term classes for referring to the clusters of the gold standard. The large number of evaluation measures proposed has brought up the need of developing meta-evaluation criteria, which intend to assess the suitability of a given evaluation measure, or to compare two measures. Usually, these criteria are expressed as sets of conditions to be satisfied by \u201cgood\u201d evaluation measures. No set of conditions enjoys universal acceptation. Here, when treating measures for traditional clustering, we use the set of four conditions proposed by Amigo\u0301 et al. in [2] for traditional clustering, along with an additional condition proposed by the authors of this work in [32,33] for the overlapping clustering scenario, as the basis for meta-evaluation. We do so because the conditions proposed in [2] were shown to subsume the previously existing conditions. For an analogous reason, when treating measures for biclustering, we additionally use the set of conditions proposed by Patrikainen and Meila in [28]. Several studies have been conducted on external cluster validation in traditional clustering [2\u20134, 9, 13, 15, 22, 31, 32, 34]. Although measures defined for this purpose may be used to partially evaluate biclusterings from the object space perspective, they are unable to take into account the quality of the feature space clustering. According to Patrikainen and Meila [28], three different approaches have been followed in biclustering validation. On one hand, a number of authors have evaluated biclusterings from the object space perspective only, overlooking information about the feature space [1, 10, 29, 30, 37]. On the other hand,\n1A wide variety of terms have been used to refer to this task. While it is called biclustering in [35], it is also referred to as co-clustering [8], subspace clustering [28], (coupled) two-way clustering [7], simultaneous clustering [6], block clustering [16], direct clustering [16], projection/projected/projective clustering [1] and clustering on subsets of attributes [11].\nother authors only take into account the feature subspace perspective [27]. Finally, a third approach consists on evaluating the quality from each perspective separately and merging the partial scores into one final score [8]. In every case, a measure that only takes into account the object (feature) space yields the same value for any biclustering whose object (feature) clusters are fixed, regardless the clustering on the feature (object) space. To overcome this problem, new measures have been proposed which deal with both perspectives in a joint manner [14]. Traditional clustering may be viewed as a particular case of biclustering, where a fixed feature subspace is associated to every clustering. In light of this consideration, it is reasonable to expect that biclustering evaluation measures, when applied in this scenario, satisfy traditional clustering meta-evaluation conditions. However, as we will show later, that is not always the case. Motivated by this problem, in this paper we present a new measure for biclustering evaluation, MOCICE-BCubed F1, which builds on the measure CICE-BCubed F1, known to satisfy the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions on traditional clustering. The new measure correctly adapts to the biclustering scenario by applying the so-called micro-objects transformation, and it satisfies the most comprehensive set of biclustering meta-evaluation conditions, while also inheriting the compliance to all traditional clustering meta-evaluation conditions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review previous work in biclustering algorithm evaluation, focusing on the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions for traditional clustering and biclustering, existing micro-objectbased external evaluation measures and the fact that these measures fail to satisfy several meta-evaluation conditions when used for evaluating traditional clusterings. In Section 3, we describe the new proposed measure and prove its compliance to meta-evaluation conditions. Finally, we present our conclusions in Section 4."}, {"heading": "2 Background and previous work", "text": "Given the pair (O,F ), where O = {o1, o2, . . . , on} is usually viewed as a set of objects and F = {f1, f2, . . . , fm} is usually viewed as a set of features, a traditional clustering of (O,F ) is a set G = {G1, G2, . . . , Gt}, where Gi \u2286 O for every i \u2208 {1, . . . , t}, whereas a biclustering of (O,F ) is a set G\u0308 = {G\u03081, G\u03082, . . . , G\u0308t}, where G\u0308i = (G\u0304i, G\u030ai), G\u0304i \u2286 O and G\u030ai \u2286 F for every i \u2208 {1, . . . , t}. Traditional clusterings may be considered as a particular case of biclusterings, where G\u030ai = G\u030aj for every i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , t}. In particular, we can make G\u030ai = F for every i \u2208 {1, . . . , t}.\nA biclustering G\u0308 needs not satisfy \u222aG\u0308\u2208G\u0308G\u0304 = O nor \u222aG\u0308\u2208G\u0308G\u030a = F . Moreover, for two\nbiclusters G\u0308, G\u0308\u2032 \u2208 G\u0308, the conditions G\u0304\u2229 G\u0304\u2032 = \u2205 and G\u030a\u2229 G\u030a\u2032 = \u2205 are not enforced neither, i.e. overlapping is allowed on both the object space and the feature space.\nFormally, an evaluation measure for traditional clusterings is a function of the form\nf : \u03c1(\u03c1(O))\u00d7 \u03c1(\u03c1(O)) \u2212\u2192 R,\nwhere \u03c1(O) is the power set of O. Such a function takes a candidate clustering and a gold standard as arguments, and yields a score that indicates how good the candidate clustering is according to the gold standard. Higher scores are commonly interpreted as better, i.e. the measure is assumed to assess the similarity between the candidate clustering and the gold standard, but that is not a mandatory behaviour, as a measure may also assess the dissimilarity between the candidate clustering and the gold standard. In an analogous manner, an\nevaluation measure for biclusterings is a function of the form\nf : \u03c1(\u03c1(O)\u00d7 \u03c1(F ))\u00d7 \u03c1(\u03c1(O)\u00d7 \u03c1(F )) \u2212\u2192 R.\nSeveral authors have proposed sets of meta-evaluation conditions for traditional clusterings [9, 22, 34]. A set of four conditions is proposed in [2] which subsumes those previously existing. An additional condition was proposed in [32, 33] to account for special situations arising in overlapping clusterings. These conditions are enunciated as follows:\nA.1- Homogeneity [2]: Let C be a gold standard and let G1 be a clustering where one cluster Gk contains objects belonging to two classes Ci, Cj \u2208 C. Let G2 be a clustering identical to G1, except for the fact that instead of the cluster Gk, it contains two clusters G\n\u2032 k1\nand G\u2032k2 , one of them containing only objects belonging to Ci and the other containing only objects belonging to Cj. An evaluation measure that satisfies the homogeneity condition should score G1 worse than G2.\nA.2- Completeness [2]: Let C be a gold standard and let G1 be a clustering where two clusters G1 and G2 contain only objects belonging to one class Ck \u2208 C. Let G2 be a clustering identical to G1, except for the fact that instead of the clusters G1 and G2, it contains the cluster G1,2 = G1 \u222a G2. An evaluation measure that satisfies the completeness condition should score G1 worse than G2.\nA.3- Rag Bag [2]: Let C be a gold standard. Let G1 be a clustering where one cluster Gclean contains n objects belonging to one class Ci \u2208 C plus one object belonging to a different class Cj \u2208 C \u2212 {Ci} and one cluster Gnoise contains n objects belonging to n different classes. Let G2 be a clustering identical to G1, except for the fact that the object in Gclean that does not belong to the same class as all other objects is placed instead in Gnoise. An evaluation measure that satisfies the rag bag condition should score G1 worse than G2.\nA.4- Clusters size versus quantity [2]: Let C be a gold standard. Let G be a clustering where one cluster Glarge contains r + 1 objects belonging to one class Ci \u2208 C and r clusters G1, G2, . . . , Gr, contain each one two objects belonging to the same class. Let G1 be a clustering identical to G, except for the fact that instead of the two-object clusters G1, G2, . . . , Gr, it contains 2r singleton clusters containing the corresponding objects. Let G2 be a clustering identical to G, except for the fact that instead of the cluster Glarge, it contains one cluster of size r and one cluster of size 1. An evaluation measure that satisfies the clusters size versus quantity condition should score G1 worse than G2.\nA.5- Perfect match [32, 33]: An evaluation measure must yield the optimum score for a candidate clustering if and only if it is identical to the gold standard.\nRegarding biclustering algorithms, a set of five conditions are presented in [28] which describe what is considered as a good behavior, so good evaluation measures are expected to reward algorithms that exhibit such behavior. These conditions are enunciated as follows:\nB.1- Penalty for non-intersection area: Let G\u0308 be a biclustering and let G\u0308 \u2032 be a biclustering identical to G\u0308, except for the fact that one (or more) non-clustered object o \u2208 O \u2212( \u222aG\u0308\u2208G\u0308G\u0304 \u22c3 \u222aC\u0308\u2208C\u0308C\u0304 ) , is added to G\u0308 \u2032, either as a new singleton cluster, or as part of an\nexisting cluster. An evaluation measure that satisfies the penalty for non-intersection area condition should score G\u0308 \u2032 worse than G\u0308.\nB.2- Background independence: The score yielded for a pair of biclusterings must not depend on non-clustered objects. Let C\u0308X and G\u0308X be a gold standard and a candidate biclustering, respectively, on a collection X . Let X \u2032 be a collection such that X \u2282 X \u2032\nand let C\u0308X\u2032 and G\u0308X\u2032 represent C\u0308X and G\u0308X on X \u2032. An evaluation measure that satisfies the background independence condition should yield the same score for (G\u0308X , C\u0308X) and (G\u0308X\u2032 , C\u0308X\u2032).\nB.3- Scale invariance: For a positive integer k and a biclustering G\u0308, a k-scaled biclustering G\u0308 \u2032 of G\u0308 is a biclustering where, for every G\u0308\u2032 \u2208 G\u0308 \u2032, G\u0304\u2032 is the disjoint union of k copies of G\u0304 and G\u030a\u2032 is the disjoint union of k copies of G\u030a. Let G\u0308 and C\u0308 be a candidate biclustering and a gold standard, respectively, and let G\u0308 \u2032 and C\u0308\u2032 be k-scaled biclusterings of G\u0308 and C\u0308. An evaluation measure that satisfies the scale invariance condition should yield the same score for (G\u0308 \u2032, C\u0308\u2032) and (G\u0308, C\u0308).\nB.4- Copy invariance: Let C\u0308 be a gold standard and let G\u0308 be a candidate biclustering. For a positive integer k, let G\u0308 \u2032 be the disjoint union of k copies of G\u0308, and let C\u0308\u2032 be the disjoint union of k copies of C\u0308. An evaluation measure that satisfies the copy invariance condition should yield the same score for (G\u0308 \u2032, C\u0308\u2032) and (G\u0308, C\u0308).\nB.5- Multiple cluster coverage penalty : Let G\u0308 = {G\u0308} be a singleton biclustering. Let C\u0308 = {C\u03081, C\u03082, . . . , C\u0308t} be a gold standard such that G\u0304 = \u222aC\u0308\u2208C\u0308C\u0304 and G\u030a = \u222aC\u0308\u2208C\u0308C\u030a. An evaluation measure that satisfies the multiple cluster coverage penalty condition should not yield the optimum score for (G\u0308, C\u0308).\nWe now discuss several external evaluation strategies proposed for the biclustering scenario. We describe the micro-objects transformation and the measures that have been adapted to this approach, namely CE, RNIA, Rand\u2019s index, VI and E4SC. Patrikainen and Meila [28] propose to transform the candidate biclustering and the gold standard into traditional clusterings in order to apply existing evaluation measures for the latter. They do so by transforming (O,F ) into the new space (O \u00d7 F, \u2205), where O \u00d7 F is composed by pairs of the form (o, f), o \u2208 O, f \u2208 F , which they call micro-objects. Thus, a biclustering G\u0308 = {(G\u03041, G\u030a1), (G\u03042, G\u030a2), . . . , (G\u0304t, G\u030at)} is transformed into a clustering G\u0303 = {G\u03031, G\u03032, . . . , G\u0303t} where G\u0303i = G\u0304i \u00d7 G\u030ai for every i \u2208 {1, . . . , t}. Patrikainen and Meila introduce their proposals on non-overlapping biclusterings, which they propose to evaluate by applying the micro-objects transformation in combination with the measures Clustering Error (CE ), Relative Non-intersecting Area (RNIA), Rand\u2019s index and Variation of information (VI ). CE determines the best matching between the candidate clustering and the gold standard, and computes the total number of objects shared by every class-cluster pair, according to this matching, which is denoted by Dmax. Let U = (\u222aG\u2208GG) \u22c3 (\u222aC\u2208CC). CE is defined as\nCE(G, C) = |U | \u2212Dmax\n|U | (1)\nNow, let I = (\u222aG\u2208GG) \u22c2 (\u222aC\u2208CC). RNIA is defined as\nRNIA(G, C) = |U | \u2212 |I|\n|U | (2)\nThe traditional Rand\u2019s index assumes the candidate clustering and the gold standard to be partitions of the object universe and is defined as\nRand(G, C) = N00 +N11\nN (3)\nwhere N01 is the number of object pairs that co-occur in a cluster of G and co-occur in a class of C, N00 is the number of object pairs that do not co-occur in a cluster of G and do not co-occur in a class of C, and N is the total number of object pairs. Patrikainen and Meila count N on the universe U = (\u222aG\u2208GG)\u222a (\u222aC\u2208CC) and, to make the candidate clustering and the gold standard be partitions of U , they add as many singleton clusters as necessary. Finally, VI is based on information theory and assesses the amount of information gained and lost when transforming the candidate clustering into the gold standard, as follows:\nV I(G, C) = 1\n|U |\nt1\u2211\ni=1\nt2\u2211\nj=1\n|Gi \u2229 Cj| log |Gi| \u00b7 |Cj|\n|Gi \u2229 Cj|2 (4)\nwhere t1 = |G| and t2 = |C|. In a manner analogous as for Rand\u2019s index, they transform the candidate clustering and the gold standard into partitions of U by adding as many singleton clusters as necessary. Also following this approach, Gu\u0308nnemann et al. [14] propose to combine the microobjects transformation and a variant of the F1 measure called E4SC. They compute the macro-averaged F1 of the candidate clustering with respect to the gold standard, and vice versa, and compute the F1 measure of both scores, as shown in Eq. 8.\nP (A,B) = R(B,A) = |A \u2229 B|\n|A| (5)\nF1(G,C) = 2 \u00b7 P (G,C) \u00b7 R(G,C)\nP (G,C) +R(G,C) (6)\nmacroF1(G, C) = 1\n|G|\n\u2211\nG\u2208G\nmax C\u2208C {F1(G,C)} (7)\nE4SC(G, C) = 2 \u00b7 macroF1(G, C) \u00b7macroF1(C,G)\nmacroF1(G, C) +macroF1(C,G) (8)\nSince the micro-objects transformation turns the evaluation of biclusterings into that of traditional clusterings, it is reasonable to expect that the measures applied on the microobjects universe satisfy a wide range of meta-evaluation conditions for traditional clustering. However, the measures discussed so far fail to satisfy some of these conditions. Amigo\u0301 et al. [2] show that Rand\u2019s index and VI do not satisfy the Rag Bag (A.3) condition, whereas Rand\u2019s index additionally fails to satisfy the Clusters size versus quantity (A.4) condition. Moreover, as we will show, CE, RNIA and E4SC also fail to satisfy some of these conditions. The biclusterings presented in Figs. 1 and 2 are examples designed to test the compliance of the evaluation measures to the Homogeneity (A.1) and Rag Bag (A.3) conditions, respectively. Both figures show the projections of the biclusters on the object space, whereas their projections on the feature space are set to be {1\u2032, 2\u2032, 3\u2032} in all cases. For the sake of uniformity in our presentation, in all cases we consider that a biclustering G\u03081 being scored worse than a biclustering G\u03082 by a measure f means that f(G\u03081, C\u0308) < f(G\u03082, C\u0308), i.e. we view the scores yielded by evaluation measures as similarity values. Since CE and RNIA are defined as dissimilarities in the range [0, 1], in both cases we transform the scores into similarity values by making fsim(G\u0308, C\u0308) = 1\u2212 fdissim(G\u0308, C\u0308).\nTable 1 shows the scores yielded by CE, RNIA and E4SC for the pairs of traditional clusterings obtained by applying the micro-objects transformation to the biclusterings shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Every pair of values represents the scores yielded for G\u03081 and G\u03082, in that order. The emphasized cells highlight cases where the corresponding condition was not satisfied by the corresponding evaluation measure, as G\u03081 was scored equally or better than G\u03082."}, {"heading": "3 Our proposal", "text": "The basis of our new proposal is the measure CICE-BCubed F1, which was presented in [32, 33] for traditional clusterings, with an emphasis on adequately handling the occurrence of overlapping clusters. There, it was shown that CICE-BCubed F1 satisfies conditions A.1 to A.5. Building on that proposal, our new measure is designed to keep the elements of CICE-BCubed F1 that make it satisfy these conditions, while adapting it to the biclustering scenario in such a way that conditions B.1 to B.5 are also satisfied. We do so by adapting CICE-BCubed F1 to the micro-objects transformation.\nCICE-BCubed F1 is based on BCubed F1 [4]. They both redefine the traditional Information Retrieval measures Precision and Recall, whose values are combined into F1. The redefinitions introduced by CICE-BCubed and BCubed relate to traditional Precision and Recall in the sense that that they assess the likelihood of decisions made by the clustering algorithm to be correct and the likelihood of known correct decisions to be made by the algorithm, respectively. They differ in the nature of what is considered as a decision. While the original measures treat the action of placing an object in a cluster as a decision, BCubed and CICE-BCubed variants view a decision as the action of making two objects co-occur in a cluster. CICE-BCubed Precision and Recall differ from their BCubed counterparts in the fact that they add an extra term that prevents clusterings that are not identical to the gold standard from being given the maximum score. In order to evaluate a candidate clustering G = {G1, G2, . . . , Gt1} with respect to the gold standard C = {C1, C2, . . . , Ct2}, CICE-BCubed Precision computes a score for every pair of objects o, o\u2032 \u2208 O as follows\n\u03c2(o, o\u2032) = min(|G(o) \u2229 G(o\u2032)|, |C(o) \u2229 C(o\u2032)|) \u00b7 \u03a6(o, o\u2032)\n|G(o) \u2229 G(o\u2032)| (9)\nwhere G(o) = {G \u2208 G : o \u2208 G}, C(o) = {C \u2208 C : o \u2208 C}, and the function \u03a6(o, o\u2032), called Cluster Identity Index (CII), averages the degrees of similarity between every candidate cluster containing o and o\u2032 and its most similar class, measured through their Jaccard\u2019s coefficient, and is defined as\n\u03a6(o, o\u2032) = 1\n|G(o, o\u2032)|\n\u2211\nG\u2208G(o,o\u2032)\nmax C\u2208C(o,o\u2032)\n{ |G \u2229 C|\n|G \u222a C|\n} (10)\nwhere G(o, o\u2032) = {G \u2208 G : o \u2208 G and o\u2032 \u2208 G} and C(o, o\u2032) = {C \u2208 C : o \u2208 C and o\u2032 \u2208 C}.

Following an analogous strategy, CICE-BCubed Recall computes, for every pair of objects o, o\u2032 \u2208 O, the score\n\u03c4(o, o\u2032) = min(|G(o) \u2229 G(o\u2032)|, |C(o) \u2229 C(o\u2032)|) \u00b7 \u03a6(o, o\u2032)\n|C(o) \u2229 C(o\u2032)| (12)\nand combines all pairwise scores as\nRecall(G, C) = 1\n|O|\n\u2211\no\u2208O\n1\n| \u22c3\nC\u2208C(o) C|\n\u2211\no\u2032\u2208EC(o)\n\u03c4(o, o\u2032) (13)\nwhere EC(o) = {o \u2032 : o \u2208 C and o\u2032 \u2208 C for some C \u2208 C}. Finally, CICE-BCubed Precision and Recall are combined into CICE-BCubed F1 as\nF1(G, C) = 2 \u00b7 Precision(G, C) \u00b7 Recall(G, C)\nPrecision(G, C) +Recall(G, C) (14)\nWe now describe our adaptation of CICE-BCubed Precision and Recall for handling the evaluation of biclusterings. As we mentioned earlier, we apply a micro-objects transformation, by which a candidate biclustering G\u0308 = {G\u03081, G\u03082, . . . , G\u0308t1}, where G\u0308i = (G\u0304i, G\u030ai) for i \u2208 {1, . . . , t1}, is transformed into the candidate clustering G\u0303 = {G\u03031, G\u03032, . . . , G\u0303t1}, where G\u0303i = G\u0304i \u00d7 G\u030ai for i \u2208 {1, . . . , t1}. In an analogous manner, the gold standard C\u0308 = {(C\u03041, C\u030a1), (C\u03042, C\u030a2), . . . , (C\u0304t2 , C\u030at2)} is transformed into C\u0303 = {C\u03031, C\u03032, . . . , C\u0303t2}, with C\u0303i = C\u0304i \u00d7 C\u030ai for i \u2208 {1, . . . , t2}. For G\u0308 and C\u0308, we will define our new measure by redefining CICE-BCubed Precision and Recall and combining them into F1. We will refer to these redefinitions as Micro-objectspace-fitted CICE-BCubed, abbreviated toMOCICE-BCubed. First, note that CICE-BCubed Precision and Recall are defined under the assumption that every object in the universe O belongs to at least one candidate clustering and at least one class, i.e. \u222aG\u2208GG = \u222aC\u2208CC = O. This assumption is not valid for clusterings obtained from biclusterings by the micro-objects transformation. Instead, we define the (possibly different) sets\nU G\u0303 =\nt1\u22c3\ni=1\nG\u0303i and UC\u0303 = t2\u22c3\ni=1\nC\u0303i\nwhich are used for defining MOCICE-BCubed Precision and Recall as\nPrecision(G\u0308, C\u0308) = 1\n|U G\u0303 |\n\u2211\nx\u2208U G\u0303\n1\n| \u22c3\nG\u0303\u2208G\u0303(x) G\u0303|\n\u2211\ny\u2208E G\u0303 (x)\n\u03c2\u0303(x, y) (15)\nand\nRecall(G\u0308, C\u0308) = 1\n|U C\u0303 |\n\u2211\nx\u2208U C\u0303\n1\n| \u22c3\nC\u0303\u2208C\u0303(x) C\u0303|\n\u2211\ny\u2208E C\u0303 (x)\n\u03c4\u0303 (x, y) (16)\nwhere\n\u03c2\u0303(x, y) = min(|G\u0303(x) \u2229 G\u0303(y)|, |C\u0303(x) \u2229 C\u0303(y)|) \u00b7 \u03a6\u0303(x, y)\n|G\u0303(x) \u2229 G\u0303(y)| (17)\n\u03c4\u0303 (x, y) = min(|G\u0303(x) \u2229 G\u0303(y)|, |C\u0303(x) \u2229 C\u0303(y)|) \u00b7 \u03a6\u0303(x, y)\n|C\u0303(x) \u2229 C\u0303(y)| (18)\nand\n\u03a6\u0303(x, y) = 1\n|G\u0303(x, y)|\n\u2211\nG\u0303\u2208G\u0303(x,y)\nmax C\u0303\u2208C\u0303(x,y)\n{ |G\u0303 \u2229 C\u0303|\n|G\u0303 \u222a C\u0303|\n} (19)\nFinally, MOCICE-BCubed F1 is computed in the usual manner, combining MOCICEBCubed Precision and Recall as\nF1(G\u0308, C\u0308) = 2 \u00b7 Precision(G\u0308, C\u0308) \u00b7 Recall(G\u0308, C\u0308)\nPrecision(G\u0308, C\u0308) +Recall(G\u0308, C\u0308) (20)\nConsider a traditional clustering G = {G1, G2, . . . , Gt1} and a gold standard C = {C1, C2, . . . , Ct2}. As we mentioned previously, G and C may be seen as two biclusterings\nG\u0308 = {(G1, X), (G2, X), . . . , (Gt1 , X)} and C\u0308 = {(C1, X), (C2, X), . . . , (Ct2, X)}, where X \u2286 F is an arbitrary feature set. When applied to such biclustering scenario, MOCICE-BCubed F1 is equivalent to CICE-BCubed F1 on the clustering G\u0303 = {G1 \u00d7X,G2 \u00d7X, . . . , Gt1 \u00d7X} and the gold standard C\u0303 = {C1 \u00d7 X,C2 \u00d7X, . . . , Ct2 \u00d7X}, as \u222aG\u2208GG = O. Moreover, the following result on CICE-BCubed F1 holds.\nTheorem 1. Let G = {G1, G2, . . . , Gt1} and C = {C1, C2, . . . , Ct2} be a candidate clustering and a gold standard, respectively, on (O,F ). Let X \u2286 F be an arbitrary feature set and let\nG\u0303 = {G1 \u00d7X,G2 \u00d7X, . . . , Gt1 \u00d7X} and C\u0303 = {C1 \u00d7X,C2 \u00d7X, . . . , Ct2 \u00d7X}. Then,\nF1(G\u0303, C\u0303) = F1(G, C).\nProof. It is simple to see that |G\u0303((o, f))| = |G(o)| and |C\u0303((o, f))| = |C(o)| for every o \u2208 O and every f \u2208 X . Moreover, in Eq. 10, we have that for any G \u2208 G and any C \u2208 C,\n|(G\u00d7X) \u2229 (C \u00d7X)| |(G\u00d7X) \u222a (C \u00d7X)| = |X| \u00b7 |G \u2229 C| |X| \u00b7 |G \u222a C| = |G \u2229 C| |G \u222a C| .\nThus, \u03a6((o, f), (o\u2032, f \u2032)) = \u03a6(o, o\u2032) for every o \u2208 O and every f \u2208 X . In consequence, \u03c2((o, f), (o\u2032, f \u2032)) = \u03c2(o, o\u2032) and \u03c4((o, f), (o\u2032, f \u2032)) = \u03c4(o, o\u2032) for every o \u2208 O and every f \u2208 X .\nFurthermore, we have that E G\u0303 ((o, f)) = EG(o)\u00d7X and EC\u0303((o, f)) = EC(o)\u00d7X for every\no \u2208 O and every f \u2208 X . Finally, | \u22c3 G\u0303\u2208G\u0303((o,f)) G\u0303| = |X| \u00b7 | \u22c3 G\u2208G(o) G|, so\nPrecision(G\u0303, C\u0303) = 1\n|O| \u00b7 |X|\n\u2211\n(o,f)\u2208O\u00d7X 1\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u22c3\nG\u0303\u2208G\u0303((o,f))\nG\u0303 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2211\n(o\u2032,f \u2032)\u2208E G\u0303 ((o,f))\n\u03c2((o, f), (o\u2032, f \u2032))\n= 1\n|O| \u00b7 |X|\n\u2211\n(o,f)\u2208O\u00d7X\n|X|\n|X| \u00b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u22c3\nG\u2208G(o)\nG \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2211\no\u2032\u2208EG(o)\n\u03c2(o, o\u2032)\n= |X|\n|O| \u00b7 |X|\n\u2211\no\u2208O\n1\n| \u22c3\nG\u2208G(o) G|\n\u2211\no\u2032\u2208EG(o)\n\u03c2(o, o\u2032)\n= Precision(G, C)\nand, by an analogous reasoning, Recall(G\u0303, C\u0303) = Recall(G, C). In consequence, F1(G\u0303, C\u0303) = F1(G, C), so the proof is complete.\nAs a consequence of Theorem 1, we can say that transforming a clustering G and a gold standard C into biclusterings and computing MOCICE-BCubed F1 on them is equivalent to computing CICE-BCubed F1 on G and C, so under this transformation conditions A.1 to A.5 continue to be satisfied. In what follows, we will show that MOCICE-BCubed F1 also satisfies conditions B.1 to B.5.\nTheorem 2. MOCICE-BCubed F1 satisfies condition B.1 (Penalty for non-intersection area).\nProof. Let G\u0308 and G\u0308 \u2032 be a pair of candidate biclusterings satisfying the premises of condition B.1, and let C\u0308 be the gold standard. We have that Precision(G\u0308, C\u0308) < Precision(G\u0308 \u2032, C\u0308) because of the extra, incorrectly clustered, object(s) involved in G\u0308 \u2032. Moreover, Recall(G\u0308, C\u0308) = Recall(G\u0308 \u2032, C\u0308), so F1(G\u0308, C\u0308) < F1(G\u0308 \u2032, C\u0308), as required by the condition.\nTheorem 3. MOCICE-BCubed F1 satisfies condition B.2 (Background independence).\nProof. The result is a direct consequence of the manner in which U G\u0303 and U C\u0303 are defined.\nTheorem 4. MOCICE-BCubed F1 satisfies condition B.3 (Scale invariance).\nProof. Let G\u0308 be a candidate biclustering and let C\u0308 be a gold standard. Let G\u0308 \u2032 and C\u0308\u2032 be the k-scaled versions of G\u0308 and C\u0308, respectively, and let G\u0303, G\u0303 \u2032, C\u0303 and C\u0303\u2032 be the micro-object-space clusterings into which G\u0308, G\u0308 \u2032, C\u0308 and C\u0308\u2032 are transformed, respectively. It is simple to see that |G\u0303 \u2032(x)| = |G\u0303(x)| and |C\u0303\u2032(x)| = |C\u0303(x)| for any x. Moreover, for any G\u0303 \u2208 G\u0303 and any C\u0303 \u2208 C\u0303,\n|G\u0303\u2032 \u2229 C\u0303 \u2032| |G\u0303\u2032 \u222a C\u0303 \u2032| = k \u00b7 |G\u0303 \u2229 C\u0303| k \u00b7 |G\u0303 \u222a C\u0303| = |G\u0303 \u2229 C\u0303| |G\u0303 \u222a C\u0303| ,\nso the value yielded by \u03a6\u0303(x, y) for any pair x, y when evaluating (G\u0308 \u2032, C\u0308\u2032) is the same yielded when evaluating (G\u0308, C\u0308). As a consequence of the aforementioned facts, we have that the values yielded by \u03c2\u0303(x, y) and \u03c4\u0303(x, y) for any pair x, y when evaluating (G\u0308 \u2032, C\u0308\u2032) are also the same yielded when evaluating (G\u0308, C\u0308).

In consequence, F1(G\u0308 \u2032, C\u0308\u2032) = F1(G\u0308, C\u0308), so the proof is complete.\nTheorem 5. MOCICE-BCubed F1 satisfies condition B.4 (Copy invariance).\nProof. Let G\u0308 be a candidate biclustering and let C\u0308 be a gold standard. Let G\u0308 \u2032 and C\u0308\u2032 be the k-copied versions of G\u0308 and C\u0308, respectively, and let G\u0303, G\u0303 \u2032, C\u0303 and C\u0303\u2032 be the micro-object-space clusterings into which G\u0308, G\u0308 \u2032, C\u0308 and C\u0308\u2032 are transformed, respectively. For any x, we have that G\u0303 \u2032(x) is the disjoint union of k copies of G\u0303(x) and C\u0303\u2032(x) is the disjoint union of k copies of\nC\u0303(x).

The result is a direct consequence of MOCICE-BCubed F1 being equivalent to CICEBCubed F1 on the micro-objects space and CICE-BCubed F1 satisfying condition A.5 (Perfect match) which guarantees that the optimum score is given to a candidate clustering if and only if it is identical to the gold standard.\nSumming up, Theorems 2 to 6 show that MOCICE-BCubed F1 satisfies conditions B.1 to B.5."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper we have presented MOCICE-BCubed F1, a new external evaluation measure for biclustering algorithms. This measure is an adaptation, based on the micro-objects transformation, of CICE-BCubed F1, which had been previously shown to satisfy the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions for the traditional clustering task. We show that the new measure is equivalent to CICE-BCubed F1 when evaluating traditional clustering, viewed as a particular case of biclustering, thus inheriting the compliance to the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions for this task. This behaviour sets MOCICE-BCubed F1 apart from previously proposed micro-object-based measures, for which we provide counterexamples showing lack of compliance with several of these conditions. Moreover, we show that MOCICE-BCubed F1 also satisfies the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions specific to the biclustering task. Our main direction for future work has to do with the practical difficulty of handannotating gold standard collections for biclustering evaluation with both the object clusters and the associated feature subspaces. To that end, we intend to propose measures capable of using traditional clustering gold standards, of which there is a much larger availability, to evaluate biclusterings. That entails proposing hybrid mechanisms allowing the use of external criteria to evaluate the candidate biclustering from the object space perspective, and internal criteria to conduct the evaluation from the feature space perspective."}], "references": [{"title": "Finding Generalized Projected Clusters in High Dimensional Spaces", "author": ["C.

In this work, we present MOCICE-BCubed F1, a new external measure for evaluating biclusterings, in the scenario where gold standard annotations are available for both the object clusters and the associated feature subspaces. Our proposal relies on the so-called micro-objects transformation and satisfies the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions so far enunciated for biclusterings. Additionally, the proposed measure adequately handles the occurrence of overlapping in both the object and feature spaces. Moreover, when used for evaluating traditional clusterings, which are viewed as a particular case of biclustering, the proposed measure also satisfies the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions so far enunciated for this task.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
