Key Words: machine translation, negative sentence, negation"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Translating English negative sentences into Korean is fairly challenging since the ways of expressing negation in the two languages are not exactly the same. The generally accepted way of the negative sentence translation in EKMT was to simply negate the predicate of its corresponding affirmative sentence, which cannot give the accurate Korean equivalent for some English negative sentences, e.g. partial negatives. We did linguistic comparison between the ways of expressing negation in English and Korean and propose an algorithm for the accurate Korean equivalents to the English negative sentences in EKMT. 1. Linguistic comparison of English and Korean negation\nLinguistically, negation refers to a grammatical construction with negative polarity [1]. The negative sentence and its affirmative correspondent are closely related in English and so are they in Korean. This requires that we should consider the English negative sentences in close relation with their affirmative correspondents and Korean equivalents.\nEnglish and Korean negative sentences have the following features in common;\na. The negative sentences are declaratives, interrogatives or imperatives in both\nlanguages.\nb. The negative sentences have their affirmative correspondents, which can be made\nnegative by adding negative words.\nintensify or soften the negation.\ne. Negation is subdivided into general negation, partial negation, double negation and\nintensified negation.\nDespite these common features, there are still differences, the most important one of which is the way of adding negative words to the affirmative sentences. The table below gives the comparison between English and Korean negative sentences. The underlined words are the negative words and the bold words are the negation-related words in English and Korean.\nPart of\nSpeech\nNegative\nWords\nEnglish Negative\nSentences Korean Equivalents\nCorresponding\nAffirmative Sentences\nAdverb\nnot\nI did not believe at all that\nhe was coming.\n\ub098\ub294 \uadf8\uac00 \uc628\ub2e4\ub294\uac83\uc744 \uc804\ud600\n\ubbff\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.\nI believed that he was\ncoming.\nNot much is known about\nthe disease.\n\uadf8 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud558\uc5ec \ub9ce\uc740\uac83\uc774\n\uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.\nMuch is known about the\ndisease.\nNot many people have read\nthe report.\n\ub9ce\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \uadf8 \uae30\uc0ac\ub97c\n\uc77d\uc740\uac83\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4.\nMany people have read the\nreport.\nNot one of the students\ncould answer.\n\ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uac00\uc6b4\ub370\uc11c \ud55c\uc0ac\ub78c\ub3c4\n\ub300\ub2f5\ud560\uc218 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4.\nOne of the students could\nanswer.\nnever\nHe has never been there. \uadf8\ub294 \uac70\uae30\uc5d0 \uac00\ubcf8\uc801\uc774 \uc804\ud600\n\uc5c6\ub2e4.

She's like her brother.\nAs the table shows the negative words in English include adverbs, pronouns and determiners,\ntherefore the subject, predicate, object, adverbial modifiers or attributes can be negated, while in Korean the negation is expressed by adding agglutinative suffixes (the underlined words in Korean sentences) to the predicates and by adding other related words (the bold words in Korean sentences) to the sentences in some cases. This significant difference poses a main problem for the translation of the English negative sentences into Korean. 2. Classification of English negative sentences\nSome English sentences with negative words are not negative sentences, so they are not\ntranslated into Korean negative sentences.\nHe just stopped working for no reason. (\uadf8\ub294 \uc544\ubb34 \ub9ac\uc720\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc77c\uc744 \uadf8\ub9cc\ub450\uc5c8\ub2e4.) The victory was nothing less than a miracle. (\uadf8 \uc2b9\ub9ac\ub294 \uadf8\uc57c\ub9d0\ub85c \uae30\uc801\uc774\uc600\ub2e4.)\nequivalents have less difference except the negative words and the negation-related words.\nLittle did I know that my life was about to change. (\ub098\ub294 \ub098\uc758 \uc0dd\ud65c\uc774 \ubcc0\ud558\ub9ac\ub77c\ub294\uac83\uc744 \uac70\uc758\ub098 \uc54c\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.) I knew that my life was about to change. (\ub098\ub294 \ub098\uc758 \uc0dd\ud65c\uc774 \ubcc0\ud558\ub9ac\ub77c\ub294\uac83\uc744 \uc54c\uace0\uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.)\nConsidering the features described above, we concluded that it is very important to decide whether the sentence with a negative word is a negative sentence and what sort of negative sentence it is. a. If the subject, predicate or the object of the sentence is negated or a negative word itself, it is a negative sentence.\nNo one could hear me. (negative subject) We said nothing about her. (negative object) He has never been there. (negative predicate)\nHowever, if the negative word is not the subject, object or predicate of a sentence but a part of an idiomatic expression (e.g. for no reason, be nothing less than, etc), the Korean equivalent might not be a negative sentence. b. We subdivided the English negative sentences into single negative (one negative word in the sentence) and double negative sentences (two or more negative words in the sentence) according to the number of negative words in the sentence, and also into general negative, partial negative and intensified negative sentences according to the part of sentence which is negated.\nThe Korean equivalent of the general negative sentence can be made from its corresponding affirmative sentence by adding agglutinative suffix, while those of the partial negative and intensified negative sentences require other negation-related words as well. 3. Translation of English negative sentences 3.1 The determination of English negative sentence\nTo translate English negative sentence, the parser should decide; a. whether the sentence with a negative word is a negative sentence.\nAccording to which part of the sentence is negated, we subdivided the negative sentences\ninto six categories;\n Negative Subject \u2013 Affirmative Predicate \u2013 Affirmative Object (NS-AP-AO)  Negative Subject \u2013 Negative Predicate \u2013 Affirmative Object (NS-NP-AO)\n Affirmative Subject \u2013 Negative Predicate \u2013 Affirmative Object (AS-NP-AO)  Affirmative Subject \u2013 Negative Predicate \u2013 Negative Object (AS-NP-NO) If the sentence matches one of the above sentence structures, the parser decides that it is\na negative sentence.\nb. what sort of negative sentence it is.\nAccording to the number of negative words and the negated part of sentence we conclude\nthat;\n Single negative sentence is general negative, partial negative or intensified negative. The negative sentence with negative subject, negative object or negative predicate which is modified by the words like \u2018every, all, always, entirely, necessarily, etc\u2019 is a partial negative sentence.\n Single negative sentence with negative predicate which is not a partial negative\nsentence is a general negative sentence.\n Single negative sentence with negative subject or negative object which is not a\npartial negative sentence is an intensified negative sentence.\n Double negative sentence is an intensified negative sentence.\nc. which negative agglutinative suffixes and related words should be added to the corresponding Korean affirmative sentence.\nKorean language has various negative agglutinative suffixes to the predicate such as \u201c~\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4\u201d, \u201c~\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub2e4\u201d, \u201c~\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\u201d and \u201c~\uc9c0 \ub9d0\ub2e4\u201d. It is not easy to decide which one makes a natural expression in Korean. In 3.2 and 3.3, we describe the principles to choose correct suffixes and related words to the corresponding Korean affirmative sentences.\n3.2 Negative agglutinative suffixes to Korean predicate\nThe negative agglutinative suffixes to Korean predicate is decided by; a. The kind of predicate verb in English sentence and its tense and aspect\nIf the predicate is \u201ca copular verb + noun\u201d, add \u201c~\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4\u201d or \u201c~\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4\u201d to the predicate of the Korean affirmative sentence, and if the predicate is a lexical verb and the auxiliary verb do is used, add \u201c~\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\u201d or \u201c~\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub2e4\u201d.\nShe is not my younger sister. \uadf8 \ub140\uc790\ub294 \ub098\uc758 \ub140\ub3d9\uc0dd\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4. He doesn\u2019t get up early in the morning.\nHe has never been there. \uadf8\ub294 \uac70\uae30\uc5d0 \uac00\ubcf8\uc801\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4.\nb. The kind of English negative sentence\nIf the negative sentence is a general negative, the above rule is applied to choose a suffix\nto Korean predicate.\nIf it is an intensified negative, the Korean negative suffix is added as general negative\nsentence.\nNo trains will be affected by this accident. \ub82c\ucc28\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774 \uc0ac\uace0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud600 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744\uac83\uc774\ub2e4. He has made promises, but kept none of them. \uadf8\ub294 \uc57d\uc18d\uc744 \ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud558\ub098\ub3c4 \uc9c0\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.\nIf it is a partial negative, the agglutinative suffix \u201c~\u3134\uac83\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4\u201d is added.\nIt is not always true that combining two substances into one releases energy. \ub450 \ubb3c\uc9c8\uc744 \ud558\ub098\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uba74 \uc5d0\ub124\ub974\uae30\uac00 \ubc29\ucd9c\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294\uac83\uc774 \uc5b8\uc81c\ub098 \uc9c4\uc2e4\uc778\uac83\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4. If an auxiliary verb is negated in a partial negative sentence, the suffixes \u201c~\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\ub2e4\u201d or \u201c~\uc218\ub294 \uc5c6\ub2e4\u201d is added to the Korean equivalent of the lexical verb and change it according to the tense of the English predicate.\nThe particles will not necessarily move the same way under identical conditions. \ub9bd\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \uac19\uc740 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc774\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc744\uac83\uc774\ub2e4.\u25cb \ub9bd\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc870\uc5b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \uac19\uc740 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc77c\uac83\uc774\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\ub2e4. \u00d7\nc. The collocation of the Korean predicate\nIn Korean, the terminative predicates of sentences are verbs or adjectives. According to the characteristics of Korean verb or adjective collocation, the suffix \u201c~\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\u201d or \u201c~\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub2e4\u201d is added.\nTheir effort accomplished little or nothing. \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ub178\ub825\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \uc544\ubb34\uac83\ub3c4 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \u25cb \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ub178\ub825\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \uc544\ubb34\uac83\ub3c4 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \u00d7\nThe Korean equivalents of some English negative predicates are completely different from their Korean affirmatives, thus making them impossible to be negated by adding agglutinative suffixes. In this case, the Korean predicate is replaced by appropriate word.\nI don\u2019t know what these symbols mean.\nSome negatives sentences (e.g. intensified negatives and double negatives) are accurately translated in Korean not only by adding negative suffix to the Korean predicate but also by adding adverb and changing the particle to the subject or the object.\na. If it is a single negative (one negative word in the sentence), the negation-related words\nare added according to the English negative word. - If the predicate verb is negated by adverb \u201cnot\u201d, no related words are added.\nThe rooms don\u2019t have air-conditioners. \ubc29\ub4e4\uc5d0\ub294 \uacf5\uae30\uc870\ud654\uae30\uac00 \uc5c6\ub2e4.\n- If the negative word in the sentence is \u201cnever\u201d, \u201clittle\u201d or \u201cfew\u201d, the related adverbs are\nadded to the Korean equivalent. She never looked like her photograph. \uadf8 \ub140\uc790\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc0ac\uc9c4\uacfc \uc804\ud600 \ube44\uc2b7\ud574\ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.\nb. If it is a partial negative, the particle added to the subject of a Korean equivalent changes\nfrom \ub294(\uc740) to \uac00(\uc774).\nNot all my friends were at the wedding. \ub098\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uce5c\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 \uacb0\ud63c\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ucc38\uac00\ud55c\uac83\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\uc600\ub2e4.\nc. If it is an intensified negative in which the subject or the object is negated, the particle to\nthe Korean subject or object noun should be changed or other related words added. - If the subject or object is a negative pronoun or is negated by the determiner \u201cno\u201d, the\nparticle to the Korean subject or object noun should be changed. Not one person remembered my birthday. \ud55c \uc0ac\ub78c\ub3c4 \ub098\uc758 \uc0dd\uc77c\uc744 \uae30\uc5b5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Few students could answer the question. \uac70\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uadf8 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ub2f5\ud560\uc218 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4.

Conclusion\nNegative sentences don\u2019t account for large proportion in English text, but their translation is important. We did a comparative study on the negation in English and Korean to establish a new translation algorithm in EKMT and introduced it to English-to-Korean Machine Translation System \u201cRyongnamsan\u201d and conclude that it is effective. 7.
