With the deployment of deep packet inspection (DPI) in telecom networks, it is possible for the telco operators to obtain user online preference.

To better infer the user preference, social correlation in telco users network derived from Call Detailed Records (CDRs) with regard to online preference is investigated. Though widely verified in several online social networks, social correlation between online preference of users in mobile telco networks, where the CDRs derived relationship are of less social properties and user mobile internet surfing activities are not visible to neighbourhood, has not been explored at a large scale.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "Nowadays, the number of global mobile telco subscribers has exceeded the world population and people are getting used to communicating with others and the cyber space via mobile phones. A huge amount of mobile communication activities are recorded by the Telco operators. For examples, the Call Detail Records (CDRs) record users\u2019 communications with others; the users\u2019 surfing activities on internet content can also be obtained by using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) [5]. The CDRs, of which each row provides information about the caller, the callee, time duration and start time of a call, could help us derive a social network among users. The call records between any two users construct an edge between these two nodes in the social network. At the same time, user preference is widely used to characterize different types of customers. With the DPI logs, it is feasible to calculate user preference under predefined categories on mobile internet. Given the social networks based on CDRs and user preference based on DPI logs, it is natural for us to ask whether the social correlation theory [21] could be applied to the mobile telco social networks.\nSocial Correlation Theory, which suggests that there are correlations between behaviours or attributes or preference of connected users in a social network, has been widely verified in several online social networks (OSNs), such as Facebook, Twitter and even the Location Based Social Networks [15, 21, 8, 20]. Previous work on mobile telco social networks have discussed social correlation between connected users\u2019 mobility behaviors [22]. Some efforts studied user profiles and demographics in mobile telco context [4].\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n00 14\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.S I]\n1 M\nHowever, they do not consider the social correlation of user online preference which are of high value in practice. Moreover, unlike the OSNs where the user behaviours such as posting, commenting, etc. are visible to their connected users and could explicitly influence or be influenced by their adjacent users [1, 24], telco users\u2019 communications with others and mobile internet surfing activities are parallel. In other words, the online surfing activities of a user is usually invisible to others, even they may have social relationships. Finally, with mobile users relying more on OSN tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Wechat to maintain their daily social circles, the relationships based on CDRs are of less social properties. In this paper, we aim to leverage a large-scale mobile telco user network to study how the users\u2019 online preference correlates in such ambiguous social network.\nUser\u2019s preference is always represented as a predefined categories vector in which every entry records how the user prefers to the category corresponding to the entry. Conventionally, the categories are layered structured with the ones closer to the roots (in our context the lower layer categories) being of coarser granularity and so forth, which are shown in Figure 1. For telco operators, the Deep Packet Inspection deployed in their networks can examine the data part of a packet as it passes an inspection point. When a telco user click a page on his/her mobile phone using browser or an APP, a request packet might be sent via mobile cellular networks and the Universal Resource Locator (URL) data part of the request (usually the HTTP GET) packet, if any, might be recorded. By parsing the page content of the URL, the visiting can be classified into one of predefined categories and the times of visiting the corresponding category content will plus one. In this case, by using the visiting times of diverse categories to present the preference, we can obtain the user preference vectors.\nHowever, DPI in Telco operators has its limitations. The surfing activities using different access networks could not be inspected, e.g., roaming to other province, using WLAN or other telco companies\u2019 mobile networks. Moreover, if the interaction data is encrypted (e.g. using HTTPS) or based on complex protocols, it is impossible for telco operators to extract the valuable information via inspection. These are very common cases in APPs of smart mobile phones. Therefore, the user preference of telco operators are incompletely built. There are a significant proportion of users might be cold start users whose preference are nearly vacant. In our real-world data set, no more than 15% of recorded users that are in the CDRs have user preference extracted from DPI. It is critical for mobile telco operators to build preference profiles for their customers and connected users, which can help operators make better marketing strategies, provide better personalized services. Therefore, an interesting but chal-\nlenging problem is the extent to which preference of telco users can be inferred from available recorded preference and mobile social networks.\nIn this paper, we use a real-world data set from one operator in a middle size city of China as the basis of investigation. The data includes Call Details Records (CDRs) for 18 months. Beside the CDRs, the data contains users preference based on DPI parsing over predefined 643 categories for 6 months and the time period of DPI logs is in that of the CDRs. The interplay of user preference to content and user social communication with others is studied based on the data set. Through hypothesis testing, we find that correlation does exist in mobile telco social networks between the preference of connected users, i.e. the preference similarities between the connected user pairs are statistically significantly higher than those between the unconnected random user pairs. Furthermore, we observe that the social tie strength based on call interaction statistically correlate the preference similarities for the connected user pairs, which we called Tie Strength Augmented Social Correlation. Moreover, We discover that besides accumulative duration and number of calls, directed call cycle is one of the determinant features which should be considered for more \u201dpreference social correlated\u201d. We then develop a model to represent tie strength based on selected features of calls between the dyads of ties.\nConsidering application value of the user preference, we define the preference inference as a Top-K recommendation problem and the objective is to recommend user\u2019s Top-K preferred categories over 643 predefined categories. Collaborative filtering (CF) is most effective when user preference are obtained enough to significantly overlap with other users, but it performs poorly for data sparsity and cold start users. In the telco case, 643 categories covers a wide range of interests and preference distribution is sparse, so we employ users\u2019 latent feature space derived from Matrix Factorization (MF) models in collaborative filtering. Comparing to purely similarity based CF approaches, applying Social correlation into recommendation system can improve the performance of CF in cold start context which is common in telco cases. And there have been some efforts carried out on on social collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation solutions [25, 14, 27, 26, 13, 12, 9], in which the Top-K recommendations can be generated[26]. Therefore, we leverage the social correlation discovered in our cases and propsoed a Social Matrix Factorization CF model to generate Top-K categories for users. Moreover, to improve the accuracy of recommendation, the Tie Strength based on call patterns is incorporated based on above discoveries, resulting in a Tie Strength Augmented Social Recommendation (TSASoRec) model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the correlation between online preference in telco mobile users network and the first to incorporate tie strength derived from CDRs with social Top-K RS in real world telco mobile network. To assess the performance of the proposed TSASoRec Top-K RS, we undertake a comprehensive experiment on the data set. The proposed TSASoRec model, for both general users and cold-start users, outperforms SoRec model which leverages no tie strength derived from CDRs on accuracy metrics.\nOrganization Some related work is discussed in section 2, followed by the interesting correlation discoveries in Section 3. Then we formalize the Top-k RS problem with social\ntie strength model and present the solution in Section 4. Experiments are conducted to assess the proposed solution and the results are shown in Section 5. Finally, we conclude this work in Section 6."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "In this section, we begin with discussions about social correlation verification as well as social strength study at telco area in recent years. After that, we review the low-rank matrix factorization models with social networks, with comprehensive consideration of diverse recommendation objectives."}, {"heading": "2.1 Social Correlation and Social Strength", "text": "Social correlation has widely been investigated in the many aspects for many years. Research on network structure [7] divided social relations into weak ties and strong ties. Some researchers focus on the constituent of social correlation. Anagnostopoulos ,Kumar and Mahdian [1] seek the role that social influence plays in social correlation with two practical experiments: shuffle test and edge reverse. This is followed by Fond and Neville [10] presenting another randomization framework. Leskovec et al. [11] explore positive relations such as friend relations and negative relations e.g.competitive relations and adversarial relations in online social networks. Xiang et al. [23] move a step further and infer relation strength from interaction activity and user similarity.\nDue to ambiguous and invisible properties, researches on telco social networks are far less than that on online social networks. [16] focuses on the relation among telco users and draws the conclusion that the role of weak ties is to keep the stability of social networks using call duration, the overlap of friends, etc. Phithakkitnukoon and Dantu [17, 18] study the social closeness and communication patterns in the telecom network by a small sample (around 3,000 users and 46,000 call activities), building a model with the amount of time and the frequency of communication. They also divide the telecom network into three broad groups by different closeness.\nA CP-rank algorithm is proposed based on the finite Markov chain for any communication system [6]. [19] proposes a framework called ASG(Aggregated Social Graphs),which could calculate the social strength from multiple communication environments (e.g. Online Social Networks(OSN) and Telecom Networks) aggregating communication information and social information. The frequency of communication between users is found playing an vital role in the measurement of social strength [3]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Matrix Factorization and Social Networks", "text": "Matrix factorization is a widely used method in the model based recommendation of collaborative filtering. At first, there is no social networks involved until the emergence of the trust network. SoRec, STE and SocialMF [13, 12, 9] bring the trust network into the loss function of matrix factorization, and achieve better performance with respect to RMSE. Ma, Hao and Zhou [14] and Yu et al. [28] consider the discrepancy between social networks and trust networks and improve the SocialMF model with different ways of similarity calculation. [27] divides users\u2019 neighbour sets into subsets, believing that users would trust different subsets of users for different domains. However, the trust network used\nin the previous models just contains boolean relations,i.e. a user trusts another user or not.\nAdditionally, many recommendation models address the problem of predicting a single rate of a user, only considering the feedback from each individual user. In addition, there are some research concerning on the top-k recommendation,i.e.for each user,a list of a small number k items from all the available items is given by the recommendation system. [26] has showed that the existing social Matrix Factorization (MF) CF models could be conveniently tailored for Top-K recommendation by extending their training objective functions with a voting-based approach to consider both observed and missing ratings. The authors extended some classic matrix factorization models to improve the accuracy of top-k recommendation by including social network in the matrix factorization objective function and has the top-k hit ratio improved especially for the cold start users. Among all the modified MF models in [26], modified SoRec model is the best which is in contrast when predicting a single rate."}, {"heading": "3. HYPOTHESIS TEST", "text": "Social networks have already been studied by many researchers for many years, especially for those online social networks, which are explored in recent years. The correlation among users has already been verified in those social networks, which provide the basis to generate effective tools to help achieve better performance. However, the mobile telco social network which is constructed via mobile phone calls among telecom customers has been rarely explored due to its privacy and invisibility. Therefore, whether social correlation exists in telco network is worth to investigate."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Set", "text": "The data set which comes from one operator in a middle size city of China. To protect the privacy and anonymity, all data we got is anonymized by the operator in preprocessing stage so that no real user could be traced or tracked via data records. The Call Details Records (CDRs) start from January 2014 and end at June 2015, in which there are in average more than 6 million users with around 100 million records per month. Each row in CDRs contains caller number, callee number, start time and duration. By grouping the CDRs, the telco mobile social networks can be derived as a graph G = (V,E), where V is the set of users and E is the set of call connections among users. To eliminate some service numbers, we only keep the relationship that two users have reciprocal calls between them in 18 months. The user preference are calculated based on DPI logs from January 2014 to June 2014. Each row records how many times the user ui has visited the predefined categories respectively during that period. In the dataset, there are around 12 percent of users in G have preference profiles. Therefore, from G we choose a maximal connected subgraph Gs = (Vs, Es) in which all users have preference as our study target. For Gs, the |Vs| = 557541 and |Es| = 6497628.\nThe predefined categories vector are layered structured in which there are 23 trees with 643 leafs/entries across 4 layers, as shown in Figure 1. The categories at deeper layers have finer granularities for classification and vice verse. In the trees structure with 23 roots, each category is the super class semantically of all categories located in the branches of it. As shown in Figure 1), the category Sports at layer 1 semantically contains the categories Balls at layer 2, Lifting\nat layer 2, Basketball at layer 3 and NBA at layer 4 which are located in the branches of Sports node in the tree 7. If the user\u2019s request is meaningfully inspected and finally parsed into one category, e.g. the NBA , the counts that user have visited category NBA, e.g. 28, will add one and equal 29. To keep the up direction consistency, the counts of all super nodes from current category uptraced to the root category along the branch in the tree are also added one, respectively. That means, according to the structure of Figure 1, the NBA\u2019s super categories, including Basketball ,Balls and Sports will increase by one, respectively. Practically, most of URLs being visited can not be classified into the finest granularity categories (i.e. Layer 4 categories). We leave the downstream inconsistency of dataset unprocessed since it does not influence the similarity metrics much. Using normalization by the total visiting times of each user, we build the new vectors as user preference for our study."}, {"heading": "3.2 Social Correlation Inference", "text": "3.2.1 HierarchySim We now have user preference profiles for six months in\ntarget data. To reduce the influence of hot popular subcategories and elevate the significance of rarely accessed ones while computing the similarities of user preference, we update the preference vectors with their tf \u2212 idf values. Since the preference vectors are layered structured, the similarity between two users according to their preference should be measured in terms of both their structures and the preference weights associated with overlapped categories. We adapt the method introduced in [2] to our cases and decompose the similarity measurement between two users as a weighted sum of the similarities between each corresponding layer of preference vectors. As the deeper layers providing a finer granularity, they are given with a bigger weight. For the similarity score between the same layers of two users, it consists of two parts.\nThe first part is the sum of weights for all overlapped categories at one layer for two users. The weight for an overlapped category, representing two users\u2019 common preference on the category, is selected as the minimum preference score of two users on that category, as shown in Equation ??. Higher the value of LayerSim is the more similarity between two users may have. The weight could also be calculated by other similarity metrics, such as cosine similarity. We compare these metrics and find the minimum weight one achieves the best performance.\nLayerSim(u, u\u2032, l) = \u2211 c\u2208Cl min(u.wc, u \u2032.wc). (1)\nThe rest part is the entropy of each layer, which could effectively separate users by the diversity of their preference, as shown in Equation 2. H(u, l) is the entropy of user u at layer l, and P (c) is the probability that user u visits category c in his preference vector.\nH(u, l) = \u2212 \u2211 c\u2208Cl u.P (c)\u00d7 lgu.P (c). (2)\nFinally, the similarity score between two users could be calculated by Equation 3, where \u03b2 is the weight with the depth increase of the layer. Here we choose \u03b2 = 2l as the visiting times for different layers presents exponential distri-\nbution as the depth of layers increases.\nHierarchySim(u, u\u2032) = |l|]\u2211 l \u03b2 \u00d7 LevelSim(u, u \u2032, l) 1 + |H(u, l)\u2212H(u\u2032, l)| .\n(3)\n3.2.2 Social Correlation Verification To investigate the applicability of social correlation to\nmobile telco social network, we need verify whether the connected users achieve greater similarity score, e.g. using HierarchySim and other ones, than those unconnected users according to their preference. We build two set of samples to measure similarity scores, the connected user pairs set and the unconnected user pair. If there exists an edge in Es, the edge\u2019s users will be selected as a user pair in the connected user pairs set. S is used to represent the similarity scores of these user pairs. For the unconnected user pair set, we randomly selected two users having no edge in Es from Vs as user pair and use R to represent the set of similarity scores of unconnected user pair set. As the number of all the randomly selected unconnected user pairs is extremely huge, we only use a small part with 56820916 unconnected user pairs.\nWhen it comes to hypothesis testing, we found the distributions of similarity score in both S and R are not following the normal distribution which is a necessity for the Student\u2019s T test [21]. Therefore, we perform a Mann-Whitney U test, which just requires the independence of every two set, on S and R. The null hypothesis H0 is that the probability of a similarity score from S exceeding a similarity score from R equals the probability of a similarity score from R exceeding a similarity score from S; the alternative hypothesis H1 is that the probability of a similarity score from S exceeding a similarity score from R exceeds the probability of a similarity score from R exceeding a similarity score from S. The alternative hypothesis using in our experiment is stronger than the classic one which only requires that the two probabilities are different. If there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis, we verify that correlation theory exists in telco social networks between online preference of connected users.\nThe experiment result is shown in Table 1 with the significance level \u03b1 = 0.001 and the single-tailed testing. All five similarity methods achieve the conclusion that we should accept the alternative hypothesis and reject the null hypothesis as the probability values p for the significance level \u03b1 are zero. In addition, the U scores of each U test for different similarity methods indicate that the HierarchySim we propose is a better similarity method than those traditional ones due to the greater U score. This result verifies that the similarity between two familiar users is higher than two strangers(Figure 2); i.e. the social correlation between connected users\u2019 online preference does exists in telco social networks.\nMoreover, as the relationships among people cannot be simply divided into two sets with whether people communicate with each other or not. Behind the calls, there may exist different relationships and correlations. An interesting problem is the extent to which the connected user pairs could be classified by their call patterns meaningfully while being correlated with the similarities on preference. In other words, can we find social correlated tie strength model based on call patterns of the tie with regard to preference? Therefore, we\nHierarchySim\ntry to separate the set S into several sets with different tie strength represented by call patterns."}, {"heading": "3.3 Social Strength Inference", "text": "To effectively distinguish the relationships in set S, we extract information from the call records during eighteen months and build a series of features to describe the relationships among users. Here we only focus on those user pairs in set S. Since a telephone call has a direction from one to the other between two users, the features we listed Appendix A.1 have maintained with directed and undirected attributes.\nWith all the features extracted from the call records, we use the classic Kmeans clustering algorithm to generate three clusters. The reason why we set the K = 3 is that some social experts like Dunbar divide the relationship into three progressive aggregation, i.e. the closest, the normal and the marginal. Thus the original user pairs recording the two user\u2019s id and their HierarchySim in preference vector are extended with a cluster tag generated by the algorithm. Here the range of cluster tag is 0,1 and 2. Both experiments for K = 2 and K = 4 have been tried but neither of them achieve a better performance than that of K = 3 in the following experiment.\nWith K = 3 non-overlapping sets, we employ the MannWhitney U test to analysis the similarity scores in every two set. The null hypothesis H0 is just like what is proposed in the previous U test. The alternative hypothesis H1 is that the probability of a similarity score from set A exceeding a similarity score from set B is different from the probability of a similarity score from set B exceeding a similarity score from set A. The set A and set B are two set selected from the three non-overlapping set. And the similarity methods applied here is HierarchySim which achieves a better performance than other traditional similarity methods. The results of U test are shown in Table 2, with the significance\nlevel \u03b1 = 0.05 and two-tailed test testing. From the table, we can find precisely that every two sets have different distribution of similarity score, which means the three kinds of relationships do have different strength of social correlation.\nFurthermore, we are wondering whether two connected users with stronger tie strength have a higherHierarchySim score between their preference vectors. Using the features listed in Appendix A.1, the tiestrength testing metric is defined in Appendix A.2 which guarantees two users have more call interactions also have higher tiestrength score. For the 3 clusters we got, the tiestrength score of each cluster is the average value of all the scores of user pairs in that cluster. The probability distribution functions of three clusters is plotted in Figure 3 for judging the distinction of distribution spreads of the high, middle, and low tie strength clusters visually. It clearly shows that the high tie strength cluster (coloured in red) has a higher tie strength score, which indicates people with stronger relations do have a tendency to visit similar content categories on the Internet distinctively."}, {"heading": "4. TIE STRENGTH AUGMENTED SOCIAL RECOMMENDATION MODEL", "text": "Unlike conventional social CF recommendation systems which only take the existence of social relationships into account, social strength is incorporated into our Tie Strength Augmented Social Recommendation (TSASoRec) model,which improves the performance of recommendation results. When training and evaluating user data in our model, instead of only considering the categories users have visited, we are going to take the unvisited categories into account. This is because user may visit one category but the DPI could not inspected for the reasons mentioned previously. Base on our TSASoRec, people\u2019s untraced preference could be recognized, which could be used to solve the cold-start problem such as filling the vacancy of users preference vectors."}, {"heading": "4.1 Preliminaries", "text": "In the recommendation system, we have a set of users U = {u1, ..., uN} and a set of predefined categories C = {ci, ..., cM}. The probability values expressed by users accessing the predefined categories are given in a non-negative preference matrix P = [Pu,c]N\u00d7M . In preference matrix P , Pu,c denotes the possibility that user u accesses a webpage that is classified as predefined category c. As each Pu,c is the posterior probability calculated according to the records, so their values are in the rage of [0, 1]. But in the telco social network concerned, each user u has a set Nu of his neighbours and iu,v denotes the value of social strength u has on v as a real number greater than 0. Since zero means there is no call between two users in eighteen months, we regard these two users as strangers. The higher the value of social strength is, the closer the two users are. The social strength value are given in the matrix I = [Iu,v]N\u00d7N and non-zero entries Iu,v in I denote the degree of social strength of a relation from u to v. As we only consider users who called each other at least once in the history records, so I is symmetric only when there is a entry.\nAccording to the definition in the above paragraph, the task of recommendation is as follows:Given a user u \u2208 U, give the rank of all the predefined categories based on the preference values we predict for each predefined category using P and I.\nIn this paper, we employ matrix factorization techniques to get the latent features of users and predefined categories and give the rank of all the predefined categories based on the predicted preference values using these latent features. Let U \u2208 RN\u00d7K and V \u2208 RM\u00d7K be the latent user feature matrix and latent predefined category feature matrix, with row vectors Uu and Vc representing K-dimensional userspecific and category-specific latent feature vectors of user u and predefined category c, respectively. The goal of matrix factorization is to obtain those latent features, know unobservable features of both users and predefined category, and exploit them for predicting the preference values. As predicting the preference value that a user accesses a predefined category is hard to be accurate, it is more practical to give a list of ranked predefined categories in for providers to carry out personalized services or market campaigns."}, {"heading": "4.2 Social Strength Assignment", "text": "Both call duration and call times have been used in the models to describe the social tie strength of telecom users. Phithakkitnukoon and Dantu [17, 18]use Euclidean distance\nof normalized duration and times to define the closeness of users, which is shown in Equation 4.\nS(i, j) = \u221a (1\u2212 F (i, j))2 + (1\u2212 T (i, j))2. (4)\nF (i, j) is the call times from user i to j normalized with the max call times of user i,and T (i, j) is obtained in a similar way.\nFrom the definition of closeness, the closer relationship that two users have, the lower the value is. In contrast, social strength grows with stronger relationships among users. So we define social strength in a similar way as S(i, j):\nI(i, j) =\n\u221a F (i, j)2 + T (i, j)2\n2 . (5)\nIn Equation 5, the definitions of F (i, j) and T (i, J) are in line with Equation 4. We limit the range of I(i, j) in [0, 1] (0 means there is no correlation among users\u2019 preference and 1 shows the strongest relationship).\nWe argue that only considering call duration and call times is insufficient. For example, user i and user j produce a large number of explosive calls in only a few days, leading to a great deal of call times and call duration. This case is likely to happen in real life. There are also user i and user j who make regular calls just several times a day. A typical example of this is a pair of lovers, making calls every day to keep in touch. For the two user relations, the closeness defined in Equation 4 and the social tie strength defined in Equation 5 are unable to separate them apart.\nTo find out neglected features in the past, random forest algorithm is used to evaluate each features listed in Appendix A.1 for their contribution to theHierarchySim score. Usually, random forest algorithm is used for classification which is able to avoid over-fitting problem in decision tree. We mix the features to compare the error in unclassified data brought by this noise. If the precision drops by a large margin after a feature is mixed with random noise, it means that this feature has a great influence on the classification of the result, and also represents its high importance.\nThe result of ranking the feature importance is shown in Fig 4, and only 46 features are shown considering the visual effect. Surprisingly, a feature that describes the directed call cycle of ties is ranked as the most significant one, which is followed closely by the feature representing the sum of duration of calls for the user pairs. The number of calls between users doesn\u2019t seem to be so important as intuitive considering but also occupies an important position. To our surprise, most features describing both directed call cycle and undirected call cycle prove to have an significant influence on the level of similarity for users preference vectors. The discoveries of first-ranking significance of directed call cycle is\nexplainable. The direction reflects the affective requirement or affiliation from caller to the callee. And the cycle of directed call perfectly express the periodic steadiness as one facet of affection affiliation strength (closeness) of the callee to the caller, while undirected call cycle may introduce the churn to the steadiness or periodicity.\nRealizing that call cycle is one important feature to evaluate the tie strength in telco social network, we employ Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to extract the feature, in which call times series made up of call times within a day from user i to user j are processed. The first main lobe in the frequency domain is extracted as call cycle and the enhanced tie strength model is as follows:\nI(i, j) = Mf(i, j) \u2217 \u221a F (i, j)2 + T (i, j)2\n2 . (6)\nwhere Mf(i, j) indicates the call cycle of user i and user j in the specified period (It should be 18 months in our data set); Mf(i, j) is the value of the first main lobe; F (i, j) and T (i, j) are consistent with the definition in S(i, j). From Equation 6, a user pair with more stable call interaction would achieve a higher value when F (i, j) and T (i, j) are fixed. In this enhanced model, asymmetry is preserved and enhanced since Mf(i, j) and Mf(j, i) are unequal with different appeal."}, {"heading": "4.3 Model Training", "text": "Although some recommendation system proposed several years ago have already considered the social relations among users, only marking whether the two users know each other is not enough. Nowadays, people have formed different relationships among each other, which means the degree of mutual affective affiliation between people depends on their relationships, i.e. their social strength. In TSASoRec, the social recommendation is incorporated with social tie strength model derived from CDR patterns.\nUsing the tie strength weighed network I, as defined above, we train a matrix factorization model to generate the ranked list of predefined categories for users. Considering the preferences which may be miss-tagged, we give a bit punishment for those categories that are not observed in his preference. Our loss function is similar to that of SoRec [?], but there is a crucial difference of the social network constructed via our social strength model. We use the following training loss function [26] as follows:\nL = \u2211 allu \u2211 allc Wu,c(Pu,c \u2212 P\u0302u,c)2\n+ \u2211 allu \u2211 allv W (S)u,v (Iu,v \u2212 I\u0302u,v)2 +\u03bb(||U ||2F + ||V ||2F + ||Z||2F ).\n(7)\nWu,c =\n{ 1 Pu,c > 0\n\u03c9m otherwise (8)\nW (S)u,v = \u03b3 \u00b7\n{ 1 Iu,v > 0\n\u03c9 (S) m otherwise\n(9)\nwhere we use Wu,c and W (S) u,v to give different degree of punishment to predicted errors for different conditions with \u03b3\nworking as the weight of the social strength network compared to the preference data;here we use the Frobenius norm, denoted by ||\u00b7||F , to regularize the learned latent feature matrices U , V and Z; P\u0302u,c is the predicted preference value of user u in category c,\nP\u0302u,c = rm + UuV T c (10)\nwhere rm is defined as the global bias term for preference matrix and I\u0302u,v is the predicted social strength value of user u for user v,\nI\u0302u,v = im + UuZ T v (11)\nwhere we define the global bias term im for the social strength network.\nUsually, Equation 7 is minimized by the gradient decent approach, but it is not efficient enough for millions of users and the condition preparing every Ru,c and Iu,v. So we apply the alternative least square approach to optimize Equation 7."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENT", "text": "In this section, we present experiment results on a real life data set to generate the prediction of predefined categories and the impact of partial parameters. We focus on the topk hit ratio or recall as a more realistic measure than the traditional RMSE and MAE [26]. Like the classical social MF models, SoRec, STE and SocialMF, we also use rank K = 10, which is the number of the latent features. Unlike those existing experiments on Epinions which only consider 4-star and 5-star ratings as relevant ones, we take every preference values greater than zero into consideration. It means even when a user access the predefined category for only once, we would like to consider whether the user visits this category by mistake or just favours it incipiently. In all our experiments, we set \u03bb = 0.01 and \u03c9 (S) m = 0 as we neglect the situation that two users know each other but they don\u2019t call mutually in eighteen months."}, {"heading": "5.1 Date Set Revisit", "text": "Many recommendation systems with social network use Epinions Dataset or Flixster Dataset, as gathering a data set containing both a social network and ratings is really hard. Here we use the data set mentioned in Section 3.1 with preference vectors and the telco social network.\nThe preference part in the data set is really sparse as there is a large difference between the average number(7) and the total number(643) of predefined categories. The data set contains 557K users with at least one entry in the preference vector. Here we regard users with less than 5 predefined categories in their preference vectors as cold start users. With the telco social network in the data set, we have nearly 6.5M pairs of users who at least called each other once, which forms the Social Relation Matrix containing whether two users know each other. We also construct the social tie strength matrix using our social strength model and relevant features extracted from the data set.\n5.2 Top-K Hit-Ratio As cold-start problem is one of the concerns in preference inference problem, the traditional evaluation metrics e.g. the Mean Absolute Error(MAE) and the Root Mean Square Error(RMSE), are not used any more here. Instead,\ntop-k hit ratio and recall [26] are more suitable to be used as accuracy measures for the algorithm.\nTo get the top-k hit ratio and recall for each user u, we rank the categories according to the predicted values. First, only categories defined as relevant are considered in the computation process and a user should show his preference on this category e.g.,the probability that a user visits this category is above a certain threshold. For instance, the rating values of 4 and 5 stars are used as relevant, while other rating values and missing rating values are considered as irrelevant. Here we define the threshold for relevant categories as 0, which means a category is relevant even if it is accessed by a user only once.\nThe top-k hit ratio and recall can be defined as the fraction of relevant categories in the test set that is in the top-k of the ranking list, denoted by N(k, u), from among all the relevant categories in the test set for user u, denoted by N(u). For each user u, the top-k hit ratio [26] is given by\nH(k, u) = N(k, u)\nN(u) . (12)\nEquation 12 can be aggregated over all users to obtain the average top-k hit ratio, and recall is defined as\nrecall(k) = \u2211 uN(l, u)\u2211 uN(u)\n(13)\nwhich is a weighted average across users, with each user\u2019s weight proportional to the user\u2019s number of relevant categories of N(u). A higher top-(k) hit ratio and recall suggests more accurate top-k recommendations."}, {"heading": "5.3 Experiment Results", "text": "Figure 5 reports the recall values of different k on our data set using Social Relation Matrix and Social Strength Matrix. The parameters \u03b3 is set to 0.01 for experiments in our data set. Figure 5 shows that the results using our social strength matrix outperform the one with the traditional Social Relation Matrix when k = 5 and k = 10. And the performances of the two matrices is evenly matched when k grows.\nOur proposed TSASoRec improves the recall by 2% when k is small compared to the large k in the previous methods. This is quite significant as the recommended content on phone is limited by the size of screen which means too\nmuch content recommendation is infeasible. In the case of a small amount of content recommendation, our TSASoRec model can lead to better recommendation performance."}, {"heading": "5.4 Impact of \u03b3 on the Results", "text": "Parameter \u03b3 controls the weight of the social strength network on the call records of users. A greater value of \u03b3 in the loss function of Equation 7 indicates that the social strength network has more influence on the loss function. When \u03b3 becomes smaller, the loss function would close to the traditional PMF model without the consideration of social networks. However, when \u03b3 is given a very large value, the model would make users\u2019 latent feature vectors similar to their direct neighbours\u2019, which omits the specificity of users themselves.\nFigure 6 shows the recall values of k = 5 and k = 10 for a range of \u03b3 in our data set. And they show the same tendency for the impact of \u03b3 on recall. As shown in the figure, our model has the best results for \u03b3 = 0.08."}, {"heading": "5.5 Impact of \u03c9m on the Results", "text": "We bring in \u03c9m to give a punishment for the condition that users may be interested in one category without accessing such a webpage via their phone. It is worthy that we figure out the influence of \u03c9m on the results. Larger values of \u03c9m in Equation 8 indicate the possibility that users do not access a predefined category they prefer via phones. When \u03c9m declines to zero, our data displays users preference more adequately and vice versa.\nWe show the results of recall of k = 5 and k = 10 for a series of \u03c9m in Figure 7. It is clearly that the performance decrease as the increase of \u03c9m with the most likely possibility value of \u03c9m = 0.06."}, {"heading": "5.6 Performance on cold start users", "text": "Some users have a wide range of predefined categories, but they may express just a few, due to the unfamiliarity with phones or difficulties in finding the relevant wedpages. Filling vacancies in users preference vectors will help operators specify the marketing plan. We consider users who have express less than 5 categories as cold start users.\nFigure 8 shows that the results of cold start users using our proposed social strength model outperform the traditional social relation one by 4% and 1%when k = 5 and k = 10. The gain for cold start users is doubled compared to the gain for all users when k = 5 but decrease as k increases. This is similar to what we discussed in the previous subsection. In Figure 9, the performance of cold users reaches around 50% when k = 5 and excel that of normal users. We believe this is mainly due to the consideration of social strength in our model."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "Motivated by the question that whether there is a correlation between connected users\u2019 mobile internet interests in telco social network, we endeavoured into Call Detail Records (CDRs) and DPI logs of a real-world telco dataset. We discovered that it is statistically significant for users with call interactions sharing more similar preference than two strangers. On this basis, we further verified that the stronger call based social relation two users have, the more similar their preference may be. Based on feature engineering over features of recorded calls, we proposed a simple\nbut effective model that describes the strength of tie between two connected users, in which the directed cycle is introduced. We defined the preference inference problem as a Top-K Recommendation problem, and incorporated the model with the social matrix factorization CF model. The proposed Tie Strength Augmented Social Recommendation is evaluated by experiments which shows the improvement of performance on recommending Top-K preferred categories for both general users and cold-start users. TSASoRec performs better under the case of less number categories ranking or inferring, which help make better marketing strategies, enhance customer experience, provide priority guidance for service providers."}, {"heading": "7.

preference profiles of their customers and connected users, which can help operators make better marketing strategies, and provide more personalized services. With the deployment of deep packet inspection (DPI) in telecom networks, it is possible for the telco operators to obtain user online preference. However, DPI has its limitations and user preference derived only from DPI faces sparsity and cold start problems. To better infer the user preference, social correlation in telco users network derived from Call Detailed Records (CDRs) with regard to online preference is investigated. Though widely verified in several online social networks, social correlation between online preference of users in mobile telco networks, where the CDRs derived relationship are of less social properties and user mobile internet surfing activities are not visible to neighbourhood, has not been explored at a large scale. Based on a real world telecom dataset including CDRs and preference of more than 550K users for several months, we verified that correlation does exist between online preference in such ambiguous social network. Furthermore, we found that the stronger ties that users build, the more similarity between their preference may have. After defining the preference inferring task as a Top-K recommendation problem, we incorporated Matrix Factorization Collaborative Filtering model with social correlation and tie strength based on call patterns to generate Top-K preferred categories for users. The proposed Tie Strength Augmented Social Recommendation (TSASoRec) model takes data sparsity and cold start user problems into Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
