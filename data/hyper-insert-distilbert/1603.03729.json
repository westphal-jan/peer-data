The neutrosophic representation is described by three parameters: degree of truth \u03bc, degree of indeterminacy \u03c9 and degree of falsity \u03bd. In this paper we assume that the parameters . The representation space ( is a primary space for neutrosophic information. Starting from primary space, it can be derived other more nuanced representations belonging to multi-valued fuzzy spaces where the set of parameters defines fuzzy partitions of unity. In these multi-valued fuzzy spaces, at most four parameters of representation are different from zero while all the others are zero [7], [8], [9], [10]. In the following, the paper has the structure: Section 2 presents the construction of two multi-valued representation for bipolar information. The first is based on Belnap logical values, namely true, false, unknown and contradictory while the second is based on a new logic that was obtained by adding to the Belnap logic the fifth value: ambiguity; Section 3 presents two variants for penta valued representation of neutrosophic information based on truth, falsity, ignorance, contradiction and hesitancy; Section 4 presents a penta valued logic that uses the following values: true, false, unknown, contradictory and hesitant; Section 5 presents five operators for the penta valued structures constructed in section 3. Firstly, it\nwas defined two binary operators namely union and intersection, and secondly, three unary operators, namely complement, negation and dual.

All these three features have implicit values that can be calculated using the bipolar pair .
