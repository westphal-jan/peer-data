Ontology evolution is a form of ontology change (Flouris et al. 2008) where an ontology modification is triggered by changes in the domain or in the conceptualization. The response to the change is the application of (a set of) predefined operators.\nIn this paper I consider the special scenario where an ontology (called the receiver\u2019s ontology) has to be changed along the arrival of a sequence of triggering bits of ontology fragments coming from another ontology (sender\u2019s ontology). In the terminology of Flouris et al. (Flouris et al. 2008) the one-step change would be termed ontology merge as the purpose is to get a better understanding of the domain from merging two ontologies over the same domain. As in our setting the merge is directed I call the kind of change operation iterated ontology revision.\nOne instance of iterated ontology revision is given by iterated reinterpretation operators (Eschenbach and O\u0308zc\u0327ep 2010). In these operators, conflicts between the trigger and the receiver\u2019s ontology is explained by ambiguous use of terms. Consider an example of two online library systems with ontologies: the sender may use Article to denote publications in journals whereas the receiver may use Article to denote publications in\njournals or proceeding volumes. As the ontologies are assumed to be over the same domain, the receiver guesses relations on relations between her and the sender\u2019s uses and stipulates them as bridging axioms, e.g., stating that all articles in the sender\u2019s sense are articles in the receiver\u2019s sense.\nNow, a challenging aspect is to define adequateness criteria that iterated ontology revision operators should fulfill. I consider the classical iteration postulates of Darwiche and Pearl (Darwiche and Pearl 1994) as possible candidates and state whether they are fulfilled by the reinterpretation operators. Moreover I discuss, for each of them, whether it should be fulfilled at all. The main result of the paper is that reinterpretation operators fulfill the postulates sequences with atomic triggers. For sequences of complex triggers, a fulfillment is not guaranteed and indeed there are different reasons\u2014corresponding to different postulates\u2014why they should not be fulfilled in the particular scenario of ontology revision with well developed ontologies.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. After some logical preliminaries and general terminology (Sect. 2) the necessary definitions for reinterpretation operators are recapitulated (Sect. 3). Before the sections on related work and the conclusion, the adapted postulates for iterated revision, results on their fulfillment by reinterpretation operators, and a discussion of the results are given in Sect. 4."}, {"heading": "2 Terminology and Logical Preliminaries", "text": "The reinterpretation framework described in the following works for any FOL theory but we consider here finite knowledge bases formulated in description logics.\nA non-logical DL vocabulary consists of concept symbols (= atomic concepts) NC , role symbols NR, and individual constants Ni. Using these, more complex concept descriptions can be built up in a recursive fashion. The set of possible concept constructors depends on the specific DL. We consider in particular the basic constructors \u2293,\u2294,\u00ac, \u2203. C(V) is the set of all possible concept descriptions that can be built from the symbols in V in the given description logic.\nThe semantics is the usual Tarskian semantics based on interpretations I = (\u2206I , \u00b7I) with a domain \u2206I and denotation function \u00b7I which gives for every c \u2208 Ni an element cI \u2208 \u2206I , for every atomic concept A \u2208 NC a set AI \u2286 \u2206I and for every role symbol R \u2208 NR a binary re-\nlation RI \u2286 \u2206I \u00d7\u2206I . The denotation function is extended recursively to all concept descriptions in the usual manner. For the ones we use here, we have (C \u2293 D)I = CI \u2229 DI ; (C\u2294D)I = CI\u222aDI ; (\u00acC)I = \u2206I\\CI ; (\u2203R.C)I = {x \u2208 \u2206I | There is y \u2208 CI s.t. (x, y) \u2208 RI}. Here C,D \u2208 C(V) and R \u2208 NR. From concept descriptions one can built axioms which can be evaluated as true in (satisfied by) or false in (satisfied by) an interpretation. We consider TBox (terminological Box) axioms of the form\n\u2022 C \u2291 D (concept subsumption) for C,D \u2208 C(V) with semantics: I |= C \u2291 D iff CI \u2286 DI ;\n\u2022 R1 \u2291 R2 (role subsumption) for R1, R2 \u2208 NR with semantics I |= R1 \u2291 R2 iff (R1)I \u2286 (R2)I\nMoreover, we consider ABox axioms (assertional axioms) of the form C(a) and R(a, b) for C \u2208 C(V), a, b \u2208 Ni and R \u2208 NR. The semantics is I |= C(a) iff aI \u2208 CI and I |= R(a, b) iff (a, b) \u2208 RI . We call ABox axioms of the form A(a) and \u00acA(a) with A \u2208 Ni concept assertions or concept-based literals. A\u0302 stands for A or \u00acA. Additionally, equalities a . = b, a, b \u2208 Ni may be allowed.\nConsistency (= satisfiability) of a set of axioms X means that there is an interpretation I making all axioms in X true, for short I |= X . Entailment is defined as usual byO1 |= O2 iff for all I: If I |= O1, then I |= O2. A consequence operator Cn gives the set of all axioms following from a set: Cn(X) = {ax | X |= ax}. If necessary, one can specify the vocabulary of the axioms: CnV(X) is the set of axioms over V following from X . X \u2261V Y is shorthand for CnV(X) = CnV(Y ). By V(O) we denote all non-logical symbols occurring in the set of axiomsO. C(O) = C(V(O)).\nThe ontology notion of this paper slightly extends the one known from the semantic web and DL community\u2014the extension relying on the distinction between an internal vocabulary V \u2032 and a public vocabulary V :\nDefinition 1 An ontology O is a triple O = (O,V ,V \u2032) consisting of a set of axioms O over a logic with non-logical symbols V (the public vocabulary) and V \u2032 (the internal vocabulary).\nIn the following I will abuse terminology by calling also the set of axioms O ontology.\nLet O1\n\u22a2\nO2 be the dual remainder sets modulo O2 (Delgrande 2008). This is the set of inclusion maximal subsets X of O1 that are consistent with O2, i.e., X \u2208 O1 \u22a2\nO2 iff X \u2286 O1, X \u222a O2 is consistent and for all Y \u2286 O1 with X ( Y the set Y \u222aO2 is not consistent.\nWe are going to deal with substitutions as means to realize name space dissociations. The set of ambiguity compliant resolution substitutions, denoted AR(V ,V \u2032), consists of substitutions of symbols in V by symbols in V\u222aV \u2032. Here, we assume V \u2229 V \u2032 = \u2205 where V \u2032 is the set of symbols used for internalization. The substitutions in AR(V ,V \u2032) get as input a non-logical symbol in V (a constant, an atomic concept or role in DL speak) and map it either to itself or to a new nonlogical symbol (of the same type) in V \u2032. The set of symbols s \u2208 V for which \u03c3(s) 6= s is called the support of \u03c3 and is denoted sp(\u03c3). In the following I use postfix notation for\nsubstitutions, i.e., X\u03c3 = \u03c3(X). Moreover, I use the following shorthands spi(\u03c3) = sp(\u03c3)\u2229Ni and spCR(\u03c3) = sp(\u03c3)\u2229 (NC \u222a NR). A substitution with support S is also denoted by \u03c3S . For substitutions \u03c31, \u03c32 \u2208 AR(V ,V \u2032) we define an ordering by: \u03c31 \u2264 \u03c32 iff sp(\u03c31) \u2286 sp(\u03c32). AR(V ,V \u2032) can be partitioned into equivalence classes of substitutions that have the same support. We assume that for every equivalence class a representative substitution \u03a6(S) \u2208 AR(V ,V \u2032) with support S is fixed. \u03a6 is called a disambiguation schema."}, {"heading": "3 Reinterpretation Operators", "text": "This section recapitulates the definitions of ontology revision operators called reinterpretation operators (Eschenbach and O\u0308zc\u0327ep 2010; O\u0308zc\u0327ep 2008). The envisioned scenario is that of two agents holding well-developed ontologies, one called receiver\u2019s ontology, the other called sender\u2019s ontology. The ontologies are over the same domain and the receiver gets bits of information from the sender\u2019s ontology that she wants to integrate into her ontology in order to get a better, more fine-grained model of the domain. A challenging aspect is to preserve the consistency of the ontology. The kind of inconsistency that is considered here is that of inter-ontological ambiguity: the sender and the receiver may use the same symbol with different meanings (compare for example the different uses of Article in the example below).\nSo, the conflict resolution strategy that is exploited by the reinterpretation operators is based on disambiguating symbols. The sender or the receiver has to reinterpret an ambiguous symbol. In the more interesting non-monotonic setting, that I consider in this paper, it is always the receiver who reinterprets the ambiguous symbol\u2014by storing the old symbol in a new name space and relating her use of the symbols to the sender\u2019s use by bridging axioms. This is in line with classical (prioritized) belief revision where one has full trust in the trigger information. In (Eschenbach and O\u0308zc\u0327ep 2010) these reinterpretation operators are called type-2 operators, contrasting them with type-1 operators in which it is the sender\u2019s terminology that is reinterpreted.\nThe weak reinterpretation operators \u2297 and strong reinterpretation operators \u2299 are binary operators with a finite set of ontology axioms ontology as left and right argument. The following example (O\u0308zc\u0327ep 2012) demonstrates the main ideas for the weak reinterpretation operators. Example 1 Consider the sets of ontology axioms O1, O2 of the receiver and sender, resp.: O1 = {Article(pr1), Article(pr2),\u00acArticle(bo1)}\nO2 = {\u00acArticle(pr1)}\nApplying the weak reinterpretation operator \u2297 gives the following set of axioms:\nO1 \u2297 O2 = {Article \u2032(pr1), Article \u2032(pr2),\n\u00acArticle\u2032(bo1),\u00acArticle(pr1), Article \u2291 Article\u2032}\nFor the purpose of the example I assume that only concept and role symbols but not constant symbols may be used ambiguously. So, the above conflict between the sender\u2019s and\nreceiver\u2019s ontology can only be caused by different uses of the atomic concept Article. The receiver (holder of O1) gives priority to the sender\u2019s use of Article over her use of Article, and hence she adds \u00acArticle(pr1) into the result O1 \u2297 O2. The receiver\u2019s use of Article is internalized, i.e., all occurrences of Article in O1 are substituted by a new symbol Article\u2032. This step of internalization will also be called the step of dissociation or disambiguation. Additionally, the receiver adds hypotheses on the semantical relatedness (bridging axioms) of her and the sender\u2019s use of Article, here Article \u2291 Article\u2032 which states that Article is a subconcept of Article\u2032.\nTechnically, the disambiguation is realized by uniform substitutions from AR(V ,V \u2032) (see section on logical preliminaries). For the disambiguation, one has to deal with the a potential multiplicity of conflicts. The minimal conflict symbol sets defined below describe the smallest sets of symbols which have to be disambiguated in order to resolve conflicts.\nDefinition 2 For ontologies O1, O2 over V the set of minimal conflicting symbols sets, MCS(O1, O2), is defined as follows:\nMCS(O1, O2) = { S \u2286 V | There is a \u03c3S \u2208 AR(V ,V \u2032), s.t.\nO1\u03c3S \u222aO2 is consistent, and for all \u03c3S1 \u2208 AR(V ,V\n\u2032) with \u03c3S1 < \u03c3S O1\u03c3S1 \u222aO2 is not consistent. }\nFollowing the strategy of AGM partial meet revision (Alchourro\u0301n, Ga\u0308rdenfors, and Makinson 1985), we assume that a selection function \u03b31 selects candidates from MCS(O1, O2) to be used for the resolution: \u03b31(MCS(O1, O2)) \u2286 MCS(O1, O2). So the symbol set defined by S# = \u22c3 \u03b31(MCS(O1, O2)) is the set of symbols which will be internalized. To regain as much as possible from the receiver\u2019s ontology in the ontology revision result, the disambiguated symbols of S# are related by bridging axioms. Depending on what kind of bridging axioms are chosen, different revision operators result. In this paper we consider two classes of bridging axioms, the simple bridging axioms and the strong bridging axioms (O\u0308zc\u0327ep 2008). Let \u03c3 = \u03c3S \u2208 AR(V ,V \u2032) be a substitution with support S \u2286 V . Let P be a concept or role symbol in S, \u03c3(P ) = P \u2032.\nDefinition 3 Let \u03c3 = \u03c3S \u2208 AR(V ,V \u2032) for S \u2286 V \u2229 (NC \u222a NR). The set of simple bridging axioms w.r.t. \u03c3 is\nB(\u03c3) = {P \u2291 P \u2032, P \u2032 \u2291 P | P \u2208 S}\nThe set of strong bridging axioms w.r.t. \u03c3 is defined as:\nB\u0307(\u03c3,O) = {C\u03c3 \u2291 s | C \u2208 C(O), s \u2208 spCR(\u03c3), O |= C \u2291 s}\u222a {s \u2291 C\u03c3 | C \u2208 C(O), s \u2208 spCR(\u03c3), O |= s \u2291 C}\u222a {s . = s\u03c3 | s \u2208 spi(\u03c3)}\nIn case of conflict, not all bridging axioms of B(S#) (resp. B\u0307(S#)) can be added to the integration result (compare Ex. 1). Hence, one searches for subsets that are compatible with the union of the internalized ontology and sender\nontology, O1\u03c3 \u222a O2. That means, possible candidate sets of bridging axioms can be described by dual remainder sets (see section on logical preliminaries) as B(\u03c3) \u22a2\n(O1\u03c3 \u222aO2). Again, as there is no preference for one candidate over the other we assume that a second selection function \u03b32 is given with \u03b32(B(\u03c3) \u22a2 (O1\u03c3 \u222a O2)) \u2286 (B(\u03c3) \u22a2\n(O1\u03c3 \u222a O2). The intersections of the selected bridging axioms is the set of bridging axioms added to the integration result. (Compare this with the partial meet revision functions of AGM (Alchourro\u0301n, Ga\u0308rdenfors, and Makinson 1985)).\nDefinition 4 Let V ,V \u2032 be disjoint vocabularies and \u03a6 a disambiguation scheme. Moreover let \u03b31, \u03b32 be selection functions and for short let \u03b3 = (\u03b31, \u03b32). For any ontologyO1 and O2 over V let S# = \u22c3 \u03b31(MCS(O1, O2)) and \u03c3 = \u03a6(S#). Then the weak reinterpretation operator \u2297\u03b3 and the strong reinterpretation operator \u2299\u03b3 are defined as follows:\nO1 \u2297\u03b3 O2 = O1\u03c3 \u222aO2 \u222a \u22c2 \u03b32 ( B(\u03c3) \u22a2 (O1\u03c3 \u222aO2) ) O1 \u2299\u03b3 O2 = O1\u03c3 \u222aO2 \u222a\u22c2 \u03b32 ( B\u0307(\u03c3,O1) \u22a2 (O1\u03c3 \u222aO2) )\nThe definition for weak reinterpretation operators is the same as in (O\u0308zc\u0327ep 2008), the definition of the strong operators is an extension.\nIn the following I will simplify the discussion by simplifying the first step of internalization: In the internalization step now all symbols of the receiver are internalized. There is only a selection function for bridging axioms. Due to the fact that the maximal candidates of bridging axioms are used in the reinterpretation operators unnecessary internalizations do not occur. I therefore can write in the following, e.g., \u2297\u03b3 instead of \u2297\u03b3 . A particularly interesting case of ontology change appears in the context of ABox update (Ahmeti, Calvanese, and Polleres 2014; Gutierrez, Hurtado, and Vaisman 2011), where the trigger informations are assertional axioms (ABox) axioms. I consider the special case that only atomic bits from the sender ontology occur as trigger, namely, the trigger O2 is of the form O2 = {A(a)} or of the form O2 = {\u00acA(a)}. That is, the trigger is a concept assertion with an atomic symbol (A \u2208 NC ) or the negated atomic symbols \u00acA. For this special case particular strong reinterpretation operators can be defined (Eschenbach and O\u0308zc\u0327ep 2010). The first class assumes that within the underlying DL a most specific concept w.r.t. an ontology exists. C is a most specific concept for b in the ontology O iff O |= C(b) and for all C\u2032 s.t. O |= C\u2032(b) also O |= C \u2291 C\u2032. The most specific concept is unique modulo concept equivalence (w.r.t. O), hence it is denoted by mscO(b).\nDefinition 5 Let O = (O,V ,V \u2032) be an ontology, \u03a6 a disambiguation scheme, A \u2208 V \u2229NC and b \u2208 V \u2229Ni. Assume \u03c3 = [A/A\u2032] is the substitution fixed by \u03a6 and assume that mscO(b) exists. The msc-based strong reinterpretation operators for concept-based literals \u22a1) are defined as follows: If O \u222a {A(b)} 6|= \u22a5 let O \u22a1 A(b) = O \u222a {A(b)}. Else:\nO \u22a1 A(b) = \u03c3(O) \u222a {A(b), A\u2032 \u2291 A,A \u2291 A\u2032 \u2294mscO\u03c3(b)}\nIf O\u222a{\u00acA(b)} 6|= \u22a5, let O\u22a1\u00acA(b) = O\u222a{\u00acA(b)}. Else:\nO \u22a1 \u00acA(b) = \u03c3(O) \u222a {\u00acA(b), A \u2291 A\u2032, A\u2032 \u2291 A \u2294mscO\u03c3(b)}\nThe following examples illustrates the second case.\nExample 2 Assume that the receiver\u2019s ontology from the beginning is extended with two additional facts on the \u201cproblematic\u201d entity pr1:\nO+1 = O1 \u222a {publishedIn(pr1, proc1), P roceed(proc1)}\nThe most specific concept of pr1 w.r.t. O + 1 is\nmscO+ 1 (pr1) = Article \u2293 \u2203publishedIn.Proceed\nHence the result of strong reinterpretation w.r.t. triggering concept assertions O+1 \u22a1 \u00acArticle(pr1) adds the following additional bridging axiom\nArticle\u2032 \u2291 Article\u2294 (Article\u2032 \u2293\u2203publishedIn.Proceed)\nThis says that the wider use of Article by the receiver adds (only) those publications in proceedings into the extension.\nThe selection-based strong operators for triggering literals provide more bridging axioms between the internalized and non-internalized symbols.\nDefinition 6 Let O = (O,V ,V \u2032) be an ontology, \u03a6 a disambiguation scheme, A \u2208 V \u2229NC and b \u2208 V \u2229Ni. Assume \u03c3 = [A/A\u2032] is the substitution fixed by \u03a6 and that mscO(b) exists. Moreover, let sel be an arbitrary selection function, defined as sel(X) \u2286 X . The selection-based strong reinterpretation operators for concept-based literals \u2295sel) are defined as follows (using auxiliary definitions for the specific bridging axioms):\noa(O,A(b),K \u2032) = {A \u2291 A\u2032 \u2294 C | C \u2208 C(V \u222a V \u2032),\nO\u03c3 |= C(b) and A /\u2208 V(C)}\noa(O,\u00acA(b), A\u2032) = {A\u2032 \u2291 A \u2294 C | C \u2208 C(V \u222a V \u2032),\nO\u03c3 |= C(b) and A /\u2208 V(C)}\nO \u2295sel \u03b1 = { O \u222a {\u03b1} if O \u222a {\u03b1} 6|= \u22a5 O \u2297 {\u03b1} \u222a sel(oa(O,\u03b1,A\u2032))\nelse\nThough the complexity of the trigger is low the induced concept lattice for the reinterpretation with \u2295sel is not trivial as illustrated by Fig. 1. Nonetheless, the figure does not suggest that the computation of the revision outcome is more complex than for other revision operators for DL ontologies: It just illustrates the subsumption connections of the concepts within the resulting ontology; the calculation of the lattice is not part of constructing the revision result.\nWithout proof I state here some observations on the conservativity of reinterpretation operators. Proofs can be found in (Eschenbach and O\u0308zc\u0327ep 2010).\nProposition 1 Let O = (O,V ,V \u2032) be an ontology, \u03a6 a disambiguation scheme, A \u2208 V \u2229 NC and a, c \u2208 V \u2229 Ni.

In iterated belief revision, this problem is approached systematically by defining, both, postulates and operators for iterated applications of revision operators. The first systematic study of iterated belief revision goes back to the work of Darwiche and Pearl (Darwiche and Pearl 1994) who stressed the fact that the AGM postulates (Alchourro\u0301n, Ga\u0308rdenfors, and Makinson 1985) are silent w.r.t. the iterated application of operators. Indeed, the only postulates that can be said to touch some form of iteration are those dealing with the revision of conjunctions of triggers (supplementary postulates 7 and 8).\nI state those postulates in a form adapted to ontologies.\n(RAGM 7) CnV(O \u25e6 (O1 \u222aO2)) \u2286 Cn V((O \u25e6O1) \u222aO2)\nPostulate (RAGM 7) says that all sentences over V following from O \u25e6 (O1 \u222aO2) are contained in the revision by O1 followed by an expansion with O2.\n(RAGM 8) If (O \u25e6O1) \u222aO2 6|= \u22a5, then :\nCnV((O \u25e6O1) \u222aO2) \u2286 Cn V(O \u25e6 (O1 \u222aO2))\nPostulate (RAGM 8) says that all sentences over V following from the result of revising with O1 and expanding with O2 also follow from revising O with the union of O1 and O2. A precondition is that the revision result by O1 is compatible with O2.\nIn general, the reinterpretation operators do not fulfill these postulates. This can be shown with examples similar those provided by Delgrande and Schaub (Delgrande and Schaub 2003, p. 13).\nBut if one chooses particular selection functions for the reinterpretation operators on triggering ontologies, then one can show that the postulates (RAGM 7) and (RAGM 8) are fulfilled. This result is similar to an AGM theorem (Alchourro\u0301n, Ga\u0308rdenfors, and Makinson 1985) which says that a partial meet revision operator on belief sets fulfills all AGM postulates (in particular the supplementary ones) iff it can be defined as a transitive relational partial meet revision operator.\nDefinition 7 A selection function \u03b3 for bridging axioms is called a maximum based selection function for bridging axioms iff the following holds:\n1. |\u03b3(X)| = 1 for all \u2205 6= X \u2286 B(\u03c3V). 2. If BA1 and BA2 are non-empty sets of bridging axioms\nfrom B(\u03c3V), i.e., BA1, BA2 \u2208 Pow(B(\u03c3V))\\ {\u2205} s.t. for all X2 \u2208 BA2 there is a X1 \u2208 BA1 with X2 \u2286 X1, and if additionally also \u03b3(BA1) \u2286 BA2 holds, then \u03b3(BA2) = \u03b3(BA1).\nNow one can show\nProposition 2 Let O = (O,V ,V \u2032), O1 = (O1,V , \u2205) and O2 = (O2,V , \u2205) be ontologies and \u03b3 be a maximum based selection function for bridging axioms. Then: If (O \u2297\u03b3 O1) \u222a O2 is consistent, then : O \u2297\u03b3 (O1 \u222a O2) = (O \u2297\u03b3 O1) \u222aO2.\nThis proposition shows that weak reinterpretation operators with maximum based selection function fulfill (RAGM 8). Moreover, one sees immediately that they fulfill the postulate (RAGM 7) because if (O\u2297\u03b3 O1)\u222aO2 is inconsistent, then trivially:\nCnV(O \u2297\u03b3 (O1 \u222aO2)) \u2286 Cn V((O \u2297\u03b3 O1) \u222aO2)\nThe supplementary postulates do not give constraints for the interesting case where for both triggers genuine revisions have to be applied. This motivated Darwiche and Pearl (Darwiche and Pearl 1994) to define four iteration postulates which, in an adaptation for the ontology revision scenario, are investigated in the following. The results below show that the reinterpretation operators in general do not fulfill the postulates.\nThe postulates are, along the original ideas of Darwiche and Pearl (Darwiche and Pearl 1994), described for\nfinite sets of sentences (here: ontology axioms), and not for epistemic states as in their follow-up paper (Darwiche and Pearl 1997). Using the terminology of Freund and Lehmann (Freund and Lehmann 2002), the type of iterated revision I consider in this paper is static: There is no (used) encoding of the revision history in an epistemic state nor do I consider the dynamic change of revision operators from step to step. As we consider the justification of the iteration postulates not as a whole but one by one this approach does not stand in contradiction to the insights made in the follow-up paper by Darwiche and Pearl (Darwiche and Pearl 1997).\nIn the following postulates, O = (O,V ,V \u2032) is the initial ontology, O1 = (O1,V , \u2205) the first triggering ontology and O2 = (O2,V , \u2205) the second triggering ontology. Note that the trigger ontologies do not contain internal symbols\u2014 which fits the idea that only the public parts of the sender ontologies are communicated.\n(RDP 1) If O2 |= O1, then (O \u25e6O1) \u25e6O2 \u2261V O \u25e6O2.\nIn natural language: If the axioms of the second trigger ontology are stronger than the ones of the first trigger ontology, then the two-step outcome (relativized to the public vocabulary) is already covered by the revision with the second trigger ontology.\n(RDP 2) If O1 \u222aO2 is not consistent, then (O \u25e6O1) \u25e6O2 \u2261V O \u25e6O2.\nIn natural language: If the axioms of the first and second trigger ontology are incompatible, then the two-step outcome (relativized to the public vocabulary) is already covered by the revision with the second trigger ontology.\n(RDP 3) If O \u25e6O2 |= O1, then (O \u25e6O1) \u25e6O2 |= O1.\nIn natural language: If the revision by the second trigger ontology entails the first trigger ontology, then the entailment still holds for the revision with the first ontology followed by the second trigger ontology.\n(RDP 4) If O1 \u222a (O \u25e6O2) is consistent then so is O1 \u222a (O \u25e6O1) \u25e6O2. In natural language: If the revision by the second trigger ontology is compatible with the first trigger ontology, then the compatibility still holds for the revision with the first followed by the second trigger ontology.\nAs the following Proposition 3 shows, the fulfillment of all adapted iteration postulates cannot be guaranteed if the trigger is an ontology. (This is the same as for the operators of Delgrande and Schaub (Delgrande and Schaub 2003).) If the trigger is of atomic nature the situation is different due to the fact that there is only one symbol to be reinterpreted. For triggering literals only (RDP 2) is not fulfilled.\nProposition 3 states results for all reinterpretation operators mentioned in this paper: Regarding the weak operators a distinction is made between triggering literals and ontologies. Table 1 summarizes the results. The rows contain the operators: The first three having concept-based literals as triggers, the last two ontologies. The columns except for the last one refer to the iteration postulates. The last column gives a reference to the corresponding result in Proposition 3. Regarding the counterexamples I draw the following distinction\u2014also reflected in the table: The weak counterexamples are those that construct ontologies for a specific selection function. The strong counterexamples are those that construct ontologies for any selection function.\nIn the counter examples that were used to prove the negative results all reinterpretation operators reinterpret only atomic concepts and roles but not constants. As long as a conflict resolution by reinterpreting only concepts and roles is possible, the reinterpretation operators can be modeled by a suitable definition of a selection function \u03b3CR: \u03b3CR selects only sets of bridge axioms that contain all identities for all constants which, in the end, means that the constants are not reinterpreted. In this case I call \u03b3CR a selection function that prefers the reinterpretation of role and concept symbols.\nProposition 3 Regarding the fulfillment of the adapted iteration postulates of Darwiche and Pearl (Darwiche and Pearl 1997) the following results hold.\n1. Reinterpretation operators for concept-based triggers (\u2297,\u22a1,\u2295sel) fulfill (RDP 1), (RDP 3) and (RDP 4). There are ontologies O,O1,O2 such that \u2297,\u22a1 and \u2295sel\n(for all selection functions sel) do not fulfill (RDP 2). There are ontologies O,O1,O2 and a selection function sel such that \u2295sel does not fulfill (RDP 3) and does not fulfill (RDP 4).\n2. For weak reinterpretation operators over triggering ontologies \u2297\u03b3 the following holds: For all postulates (RDP x), 1 \u2264 x \u2264 3, there are ontologies O,O1,O2 such that for all selection functions \u03b3CR\nthat prefer the reinterpretation of role and concept symbols \u2297\u03b3 does not fulfill (RDP x). There are ontologies O,O1,O2 and a selection function\n\u03b3CR that prefer the reinterpretation of role and concept symbols such that \u2297\u03b3 does not fulfill (RDP 4).\n3. For strong reinterpretation operators over triggering ontologies \u2299\u03b3 the following holds: For all postulates (RDP 1), (RDP 3), (RDP 4) there are ontologies O,O1,O2 and selection functions \u03b3 such that \u2299\u03b3 does not fulfill any of them. There are ontologies O,O1,O2 such that for all selection functions \u03b3CR that prefer the reinterpretation of concepts and role symbols \u2299\u03b3 does not fulfill (RDP 2).\nI discuss the outcomes of the proposition for the four postulates one by one starting with (RDP 2) which (in its original form given by Darwiche and Pearl) evoked most of the criticism. Regarding this postulate I follow the argument of Delgrande and Schaub (Delgrande and Schaub 2003) according to which (RDP 2) may make sense only for noncomplex triggers. For complex triggers, say in our case: complex ontologies O1 (and O2), does not work. Assume O1 is made out of two sub-ontologies O11 und O12 s.t. only O12 is not compatible with O2. All those assertions that follow from O \u25e6 O1 on the basis of O11 should be conserved after the revision with O2. But according to (RDP 2) amnesic revision would be allowed if O2 would not entail O11: All sentences inferred with O11 would be eliminated in favor of the new ontology O2.\nRegarding the first iteration postulate, the following simple example by Delgrande and Schaub (Delgrande and Schaub 2003) demonstrates its questionable status. Actually, for the proof of Proposition 3.2 I use adapted variants of this example. Consider the ontologies O = {\u00acA(a)}, O1 = {(A \u2294 B)(a)} und O2 = {A(a)} |= O1. Let \u03b3 be a selection function that prefers the reinterpretation of concept and role symbols. The second ontology O2 ist stronger than the first ontology O1. Revision with O2 leads to an ontology in which B(a) does not hold: O \u2297\u03b3 O2 6|= B(a). The revision with the first ontology leads to an ontology in which B(a) holds: O\u2297\u03b3 O1 = {\u00acA(a), (A\u2294B)(a)} |= B(a). The revision by the first and then by the second ontology gives an ontology that still entails B(a):\n(O \u2297\u03b3 O1)\u2297 \u03b3 O2 = {\u00acA(a), (A \u2294B)(a), A \u2032(a\u2032),\nA \u2291 A\u2032, a . = a\u2032, B \u2291 B\u2032,\nB\u2032 \u2291 B} |= B(a)\nAll preconditions in the antecedent of (RDP 1) are fulfilled but not the succedens: (O \u2297\u03b3 O1)\u2297\u03b3 O2 6\u2261V O \u2297\u03b3 O2.\nThere is no plausible revision operator for this particular ontology setting that would fulfill (RDP 1). Such an operator would have to fulfill O \u25e6O1 |= B(a) as O and O1 are compatible. The revision with O2 should not eliminate B(a) as B(a) is not relevant for the conflict: (O \u25e6O1) \u25e6O2 |= B(a). Clearly, one could define syntax-sensitive revision operators on belief bases s.t. (O \u25e6 O1) \u25e6 O2 6|= B(a) so that the fulfillment of (RDP 1) could be achieved also for this ontology configuration. But this does not change the situation that also (O \u25e6 O1) \u25e6 O2 |= B(a) should be fulfilled. Moreover, syntax-sensitive belief-base operators are not appropriate for\nthe revision of ontologies for which we would like to ensure (unique) syntax insensitive representations. So the only possibility for \u25e6 to fulfill (RDP 1) is that O \u25e6 O2 |= B(a) holds. Such an operator \u25e6 that fulfills these conditions can be defined : O entails (\u00acA \u2294 B)(a) and (\u00acA \u2294 \u00acB)(a). If \u25e6 has a selection function \u03b3 that chooses (\u00acA \u2294 B)(a), then O \u25e6O2 would entail B(a). But one could equally have a selection function \u03b3\u2032 such that O \u25e6 O2 6|= B(a) or even O \u25e6O2 |= \u00acB(a). There is no adequate reason for assuming that one has to prefer \u03b3 over \u03b3\u2032.\nThe counter example against (RDP 1) refers to triggering ontologies. For non-complex triggers such as concept-based literals a counter example cannot be constructed. Indeed: In this case all reinterpretation operators fulfill (RDP 1) (besides (RDP 3) and (RDP 4) ( see Proposition 3.1).\nRegarding the weak reinterpretation operator for triggering ontologies \u2297\u03b3 one can construct examples such that for all selection functions \u03b3 that prefer the reinterpretation of concept and role symbols \u2297\u03b3 does not fulfill the postulate (RDP 3) (Proposition 3.2). For strong reinterpretation operators for triggering ontologies one can at least construct ontologies and at least one selection function showing the non-fulfillment (RDP 3). The counter example for the weak variants is based on the interplay of trivial revision (consistency case) and non-trivial revision (inconsistency case):\nO = {A(a),\u00acB(a) \u2228 \u00acA(c), A(b) \u2228 \u00acA(e)}\nO1 = {\u00acA(b)}\nO2 = {\u00acA(a), B(a), A(c) \u2228 \u00acA(b), A(e)}\nO and O1 are chosen such that they are compatible and so O \u2297\u03b3 O1 = O \u222a O1 |= \u00acA(e). Due to the antecedens in postulate (RDP 3) the revision by the second triggering ontology O2 gives an ontology O \u2297\u03b3 O2 that entails the first trigger O1. The conflict resolution for O2\u222aO is such that O1 is not effected by it. But a previous revision with O1 requires a different (additional) conflict resolution with O2 such that O1 is not entailed anymore: (O\u2297\u03b3O1)\u2297\u03b3O2 6|= {\u00acA(b)}(= O1). The reason that \u00acA(b) cannot be inferred anymore is due to the fact that the conflict resolution for O \u2297\u03b3 O1 and O2 leads to a reinterpretation of A, and due to the fact that the assertion \u00acA(e), which follows from O \u2297\u03b3 O1, has the same polarity as \u00acA(b): namely, it is also negated.\nThis lost of \u00acA(b) is due to the construction of the reinter-\npretation operators which implement a uniform reinterpretation: In case of conflicts all occurrences of symbols involved in the conflict are internalized. Only by introducing bridging axioms is it possible to regain assertions in the public vocabulary. But when the bridging axioms are not expressive enough, then old sentences of the receiver (such as \u00acA(b) in this example) may not be entailed anymore. This last discussion regarding (RDP 3) (and similarly for (RDP 4)) cannot be used as general arguments against (RDP 3) and (RDP 4) as adequate reinterpretation postulates. One may construct plausible ontology revision operators fulfilling (RDP 3) and (RDP 4), but these cannot implement uniform reinterpretation: They would have to do partial reinterpretation (as, e.g., done by Goeb and colleagues (Goeb et al. 2007)). So, acceptable arguments against (RDP 3) and (RDP 4) would have to support the requirement of uniformity within reinterpretation. And indeed, there are good arguments in form of novel postulates that are motivated by typical requirements in ontology change settings: One wants to preserve the ontologies somehow in the ontology revision result and also wants them to be reconstructible. In particular these requirements occur when the ontologies are well-developed.\nI describe these postulates for the iterated scenario with a sequence SEQ of triggering ontologies. Let O = (O,V ,V \u2032) be an ontology and let SEQ be a finite sequence of ontology axioms containing only symbols in the public vocabulary V .\nAn operator \u25e6 that fulfills the iterated preservation postulate for the left argument (Preservation) has to guarantee that there is a substitution \u03c3 s.t. the initial ontology O is preserved in internalized form O\u03c3 in the result of iterated revision with a sequence SEQ.\n(Preservation) There is a substitution \u03c3 s.t.:"}, {"heading": "O\u03c3 \u2286 O \u25e6 SEQ", "text": "An operator \u25e6 that fulfills (Reconstruction) has to guarantee the existence of a substitution \u03c1 such that the initial ontology O and the set set(SEQ) of all triggering ontologies in the sequence SEQ are contained in a renamed variant of the revision result (O \u25e6 SEQ)\u03c1.\n(Reconstruction) There is a substitution \u03c1 s.t.:\nO \u222a set(SEQ) \u2286 (O \u25e6 SEQ)\u03c1\nAll reinterpretation operators of this paper fulfill both postulates.

Moreover, I consider different stronger forms of bridging axioms than the implications of (Delgrande and Schaub 2003).\nBridging axioms are special mappings that are used in the reinterpretation operator as auxiliary means to implement ontology revision. One may also consider mappings by themselves as the objects of revision (Qi, Ji, and Haase 2009; Meilicke and Stuckenschmidt 2009). A particularly interesting case of mapping revision comes into play with mappings used in the ontology based data access paradigm (Calvanese et al. 2009). These mappings are meant to lift data from relational DBs to the ontology level thereby mapping between close world of data and the open world of ontologies. In this setting different forms of inconsistencies induced by the mappings can be defined (such as local vs. global inconsistency) and based on this mapping evolution ensuring (one form of consistency) be investigated (Lembo et al. 2015).\nIn this paper I used reinterpretation operators as change operators on ontologies described in DLs. There are different other approaches that use the ideas of belief revision for different forms of ontology change such as ontology evolution over DL-Lite ontologies (Kharlamov, Zheleznyakov, and Calvanese 2013) or ontology debugging (Ribeiro and Wassermann 2009). As the consequence operator over DLs do not fulfill all preconditions assumed by AGM (Alchourro\u0301n, Ga\u0308rdenfors, and Makinson 1985) one cannot directly transfer AGM constructions and ideas one-to-one to the DL setting as noted, e.g., by Flouris and colleagues (Flouris, Plexousakis, and Antoniou 2005) and dealt in more depth for non-classical logics by Ribeiro (Ribeiro 2012). For the definition of the reinterpretation operators the constraint is not essential. Nonetheless, they lead to constraints in providing appropriate counter examples: namely ontologies expressible in the DL at hand."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The paper discussed iterative applications of reinterpretation operators meant to handle conflicts due to ambiguous use of symbols in related and well-developed ontologies. Reinterpretation operators may also be used for solving consistencies not due to ambiguity but due to false information\u2014and indeed, the related revision operators in (Delgrande and Schaub 2003) do not talk about ambiguity. But reinterpretation operators cannot be used to solve inconsistencies that clearly cannot be explained by ambiguity: namely consistencies due to different constraints of the sender and the receiver regarding the number of possible objects in the domain (this was discussed under the term reinterpretation compatibility in (O\u0308zc\u0327ep 2008)).\nThe reinterpretation for triggering literals were shown to fulfill (adapted versions of) classical iteration postulates of Darwiche and Pearl (Darwiche and Pearl 1994) whereas the reinterpretation operators for ontologies were shown in general not to fulfill them. Some of the postulates were criticized for general reasons. Nonetheless, still one may consider other forms of reinterpretation operators that incorporate the reinterpretation history in order to define dynamic operators: For example one might weight symbols according to the number of times they were reinterpreted and then use a comparison of the weights in the next iteration step in order to decided which symbols to reinterpret next.\nIn addition to the general criticisms I discussed the adequateness of the other postulates in view of the special ontology change scenario. Here one cannot guarantee the fulfillment by reinterpretation operators that implement a uniform reinterpretation.

Proof. If O\u03c3V \u222a O1 \u222a O2 \u222a X2 is consistent, so is O1 \u222a O2 \u222aX2. If X2 is not maximal, then there is a superset X1 in B(\u03c3V) \u22a2 (O\u03c3V \u222aO1).\nDefine the following sets X1 = \u03b3(B(\u03c3V) \u22a2 (O\u03c3V \u222aO1))\nX2 = \u03b3(B(\u03c3V)\n\u22a2\n(O\u03c3V \u222aO1 \u222aO2))\nWith this notation we have (O\u2297\u03b3 O1)\u222aO2 = O\u03c3V \u222aO1 \u222a O2 \u222aX1 and (O\u2297\u03b3 O1)\u222aO2 = O\u03c3V \u222aO1 \u222aO2 \u222aX2. Assume that (O\u2297\u03b32O1)\u222aO2 is consistent. Then there is a X\n\u2032 \u2208 B(\u03c3V) \u22a2\n(O\u03c3V\u222aO1\u222aO2) with X1 \u2286 X \u2032. Because of Lemma 1 there is a X \u2032\u2032 \u2208 B(\u03c3V) \u22a2\n(O\u03c3V \u222a O1) with X \u2032 \u2286 X \u2032\u2032. Hence X1 \u2286 X \u2032\u2032. But as X1 is inclusion maximal, one gets X1 = X \u2032\u2032 = X \u2032 and hence X1 \u2208 B(\u03c3V) \u22a2\n(O\u03c3V \u222aO1\u222aO2). Due to Lemma 1 the first precondition for maximum based selection functions was shown to hold. Now we showed also that the second condition holds, hence X1 = X2.

So for the following assume that O is consistent. Proof of 1. In the following let \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2297,\u22a1,\u2295sel}.\nProof for (RDP 1): As O1 and O2 are trigger literals, O2 |= O1 holds iff O1 = O2. Hence (O \u25e6 O1) \u25e6 O2 = (O \u25e6 O2) \u25e6 O2 = O \u25e6 O2, as the reinterpretation operators fulfill the success postulate.\nCounterexample for (RDP 2): Let O = {A(b)}, O1 = {A(a)} and O2 = {\u00acA(a)}. Then O1 \u222a O2 |= \u22a5. On the one hand O \u25e6 O2 = {A(b),\u00acA(a)} |= A(b); on the other hand (O\u25e6O1)\u25e6O2 = {A(b), A(a)}\u25e62{\u00acA(a)} 6|= A(b) due to Proposition 1.3 (for the weak operators) and Proposition 1.4 (for the strong operators) and again due to 1.3 for the selection based operators \u2295sel, as in this case (O \u2297 O1) \u2297 O2 \u2261 (O \u2295sel O1)\u2295sel O2.\nProof for (RDP 3): Let O \u25e6 O2 |= O1. Case 1: O\u222aO2 is consistent. As O1 are O2 literals, O2 |= O1 means that O1 = O2. Now (O \u25e6O1) \u25e6 O2 = (O \u25e6 O2) \u25e6 O2 = O \u222aO2 = O \u25e6 O2.\nCase 2: O \u222a O2 is inconsistent. We show the proof for O2 = {A(a)}. (The case that O2 = {\u00acA(a)} is proved similarly.) Subcase 2.1: A /\u2208 V(O1). Then from O \u25e62 O2 |= O1 and Proposition 1.1, it follows that O |= O1, hence (O \u25e6 O1) = O \u222a O1. Because of 1.1 one has: (O \u222a O1) \u25e6 O2 |= O1. Subcase 2.2: A \u2208 V(O1). Let \u25e6 = \u2297. Because of O \u25e6 O2 |= O1 and Proposition 1.3 it must be the case that O1 contains A positively, i.e., O1 = {A(c)}. Because \u2297 fulfills the success postulate O\u2297 {A(c)} |= {A(c)} and hence also (O\u2297{A(c)})\u222a{a 6 . = c} |= {A(c)}. Because of Proposition 1.2 one gets (O \u2297 {A(c)}) \u22972 {A(a)} |= {A(c)}. Now consider the case \u25e6 = \u22a1. If A is positive in O1, then O1 = {A(c)}. In this case again Proposition 1.2 gives the result (O \u22a1 O1) \u22a1 O2 |= O1. In the other case O1 is of the form O1 = {\u00acA(c)}; using the assumptionO\u25e6O2 |= O1 one gets with Proposition 1.4 that O |= \u00acmscO(a)(c) and O |= O1. In particular O\u22a1 O1 = O \u222aO1 \u2261 O. Also mscO\u22a1O1(a) = mscO(a). Hence fromO |= \u00acmscO(a)(c) we getO\u22a1O1 |= \u00acmscO\u22a1O1(a)(c). Because O \u22a1 O1 |= O1 holds, one can infer with Proposition 1.4 that (O\u22a1O1)\u22a12O2 |= O1. With a similar argument and Proposition 1.5 one can show that the results holds for \u25e6 = \u2295sel.\nProof for (RDP 4): Let O1 \u222a (O \u25e6 O2) be consistent. Case 1: O \u222a O2 is consistent. Then O \u25e6 O2 = O \u222a O2 and so O1 \u222a (O \u222a O2) 6|= \u22a5 due to assumption. But then O \u25e6 O1 = O \u222aO1.\nCase 2: O \u222aO2 is not consistent. If also (O \u25e6 O1) \u222aO2is consistent, then (O \u25e6 O1) \u25e6 O2 = (O \u25e6 O1) \u222a O2. As O \u25e6 O1 |= O1 we then have (O \u25e6 O1) \u25e6 O2 |= O1, in particular O1 \u222a (O \u25e6O1) \u25e6O2) 6|= \u22a5. Therefore consider now the case that (O \u25e6 O1) \u222aO2 is inconsistent.\nWe show the result for O2 = {A(a)} (The argument for negative literals is similar). Subcase 2.1: A /\u2208 V(O1). Due to success, O \u25e6O1 |= O1 and with Proposition 1.1 it follows that (O\u25e6O1)\u25e6O2 |= O1. Because (O\u25e6O1)\u25e6O2 is consistent so is O1 \u222a (O \u25e6O1)\u25e6O2. Subcase 2.2: A \u2208 V(O1). Assume O1\u222a(O\u25e6O1)\u25e6O2 |= \u22a5. Is O1 of form O1 = {\u00acA(c)}, then due to Proposition 1.2 it holds that O1 \u222aO \u25e6 O1 \u222a {a 6 . = c} is not consistent. Because O \u25e6 O1 |= O1 this can be the\ncase only if O \u25e6 O1 |= a . = c. Then O1 = {\u00acA(a)} which contradicts the assumption O1 \u222a (O \u25e6 O2) 6|= \u22a5. If O1 has the form O1 = {A(c)}, then, due to Proposition 1.3, this can only be the case if \u25e6 = \u22a1 or \u25e6 = \u2295sel. With the assumption that (O1\u222a(O\u25e6O1)\u25e6O2 is not consistent, i.e. (O\u25e6 A(c))\u25e6A(a) |= \u00acA(c), one could infer with Proposition 1.4 and 1.5 that O\u25e6A(c) |= \u00acA(c) which would mean that O1\u222a (O \u25e6 O1) is not consistent\u2014-contradicting the consistency of O \u22a1 O1 and the fact that O \u22a12 O1 |= O1.

The discussion centers on adaptations of the classical iteration postulates according to Darwiche and Pearl. The main result of the paper is that reinterpretation operators fulfill the postulates for sequences containing only atomic triggers. For complex triggers, a fulfillment is not guaranteed and indeed there are different reasons for the different postulates why they should not be fulfilled in the particular scenario of ontology revision with well developed ontologies.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
