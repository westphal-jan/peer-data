To enable trust computation in computing systems, the trust definitions need to be conveyed in a measurable or quantifiable notations such as statistical representations. The first attempt to represent trust in the statistical notations was by (Dempster, 1967). Dempster showed a probability measurement that is to define an upper and lower probabilities for a multivalued mapping. The probability measurement is a generalization of calculus in Bayesian theory. His statistical scheme is adopted by (Shafer, 1979, 1976) and it provides elegant method to compute trust. Many researchers later (in 1980-1995) addressed both works as the foundation for a concrete trust computation, which they began to call as Dempster-Shafer theory in the early 1980s (Shafer,\n1 This manuscript is a draft version. The final version will be published in a reputable journal. One may contact the main author (anuarls@hotmail.com) for further clarification or discussion for an implementation of the trust algebra.\n2015). Later (J\u00f8sang, 1997) provided an extension to a probabilistic calculus for the Dempster-Shaper theory by introducing an artificial reasoning, named subjective logic.

One may define more than triple conditions to implement granularity and fuzziness in the relations.\nRemark 7.2 One should not modify in order to implement an additional condition of relations because it will increase\ndifficulties in properties \ud835\udcab classification and nominal data (value assignment). Our suggestion for more than the triple scalar\nrelations is to directly map the Mass Trust Perception\u2019s value in Theorem 4 into the septuple scalar. One must define a\nlower bound and an upper bound for each new relation element. The new relation element is a subset of the existing triple\n(e.g. Near-Hostile \u2282 Hostile).\nTheorem 4.
