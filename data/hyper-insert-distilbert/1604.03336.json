As a notion of stability, it has also been recently re-purposed to ensure generalization and statistical validity in adaptive data analysis [DFH+15b, DFH+15a, DFH+15c, BNS+16]. Depsite of its power, releasing real-valued queries (statistics) under differential privacy in general entails the assumption that such queries are of bounded sensitivity, that is, the maximum change in the value of the query\u2019s output due to a change in any single data point in the dataset has to be bounded.\nTypical Stability/Privacy. In this work, we introduce a new notion of algorithmic stability called typical stability that does not require the queries to be of bounded-sensitivity, but instead requires the output of each query, when evaluated on a dataset drawn from the underlying distribution, to be \u201cwell-concentrated\u201d around its mean with respect to that distribution. Our notion can also be motivated as an alternative definition for privacy in scenarios. Moreover, this notion introduces a new algorithmic stability approach for ensuring generalization in adaptive data analysis especially in the settings where queries are not necessarily of bounded sensitivity.\nAs it is the case with differential privacy, typical stability1 is presented in two versions : pure and approximate typical stability. In general, typical stability is defined via three parameters: \u03b7,\u03c4, and \u03bd. When \u03c4 = 0, we call it pure typical stability, otherwise, we call it approximate typical stability. We will give here an intuitive description of this notion (Formal definitions are given in Section 2). Consider a randomized algorithm A that takes as input a dataset drawn from some arbitrary distribution P over the dataset domain X n. We say that A is (\u03b7,\u03c4,\u03bd)-typically stable algorithm if there is a subset S \u2286 X n whose measure with respect to P is at least 1\u2212 \u03bd such that for any pair of datasets x,y \u2208 S , the distribution of A(x) is \u201cclose\u201d to that of A(y). Such closeness is determined by the two parameters \u03b7 and \u03c4 that play similar roles to that of \u03b5 and \u03b4 in differential privacy. So, intutively, S is a set of \u201ctypical\u201d datasets, and roughly speaking, we require the distributions of the output of A on any pair of typical datasets to be \u201cindistinguishable\u201d. The intuition is that the output ofA should \u201cconceal\u201d the identity of the dataset inside the typical set S , that is, the output should not reveal which of the typical datasets is the true input of A. However, the output should still reveal information about S as a whole since such information depends on the underlying distribution P rather than the sample. In this sense, typical stability ensures that the whatever is revealed by the algorithm is essentially information shared by all typical datasets.\nparagraphConcentrated Queries. In this work, we consider the query release problem under typical stability. As mentioned earlier, we consider classes of queries whose ouputs are concentrated around their expectation with respect to the underlying distribution on the dataset. We formally describe such classes as follows. We say that a class Q\u03b3n(P) of real-valued queries on a dataset from X n is \u03b3n-concentrated with respect to distribution P over X n if there is a non-negative, non-decreasing function \u03b3n : R+\u2192 R+ (that possibly depends on n) such that for every query q \u2208Q\u03b3n(P), with probability at least 1\u2212 e \u2212\u03b3n(\u03b1) over the choice of a dataset X \u223c P, the generalization\nerror of q is bounded by \u03b1, where generalization error refers to the quantity \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223q(X)\u2212 EY\u223cP [q(Y )] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223. For different settings of \u03b3n, we obtain query classes that contain the class of subgaussian queries and the class of sub-exponential queries which were studied in [RZ15], and the more special class of jointly Gaussian queries that was studied in both [RZ15, WLF16].\n1To avoid using long terms, in the sequel, we will just refer to this notion as typical stability. However, we stress that our motivation for this notion includes both stability and privacy.\nOur notion is similar to a notion called perfect generalization that was introduced very recently and independently by Cummings et al. [CLN+16]2 where it was also studied in the context of generalization in PAC-learning models. In this paper, we discuss the composition guarantees of this notion and prove a composition theorem that gives a characterization of the degradation of the parameters of typical stability when a sequence of k arbitrarily and adaptively chosen typically stable algorithms3 operating on the same dataset are composed together.\nProperties of Typical Stability. We show that this notion is closed under post-processing, and robust to adaptive composition. We provide a characterization of the degradation in the parameters of typical stability under k-fold adaptive composition. We also show that typical stability implies generalization by first proving an independence lemma that follows from the defintion of typical stability. In particular, we show that any \u03b3n-concentrated query generated from a typically stable interaction with the dataset will have small generalization error with high probability (i.e., it will not overfit to the same dataset).\nAchieving Typical Stability via Noise-Adding Mechanisms. We give simple noise-addition typically stable mechanisms for answering real-valued queries. Our mechanisms are based on adding Laplace and Gaussian noise to the query output to achieve pure and approximate typical stability, respectively. These mechanisms are very similar to the popular differentially private Lalplace and Gaussian mechanisms [DMNS06, DKM+06], however, the added noise is calibrated differently in our case. In particular, the noise is added based on how \u201cwell\u201d the query output is concentrated around its expectation, that is, roughly speaking, the noise is claibrated to the concentration radius of the query. More formally, let P be an arbitratry distribution on X n. For\na query q : X n\u2192R, if we have P X\u223cP [\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223q(X)\u2212 EY\u223cP [q(Y )] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 > \u03b1] < \u03bd, then, our mechanisms would add noise (Laplace for pure, and Gaussian for approximate typical stability) whose standard deviation proportional to \u03b1."}, {"heading": "2 Typical Stability/Privacy", "text": "Before we formally define typical stability, we first state a standard definition for the notion (\u03b7,\u03c4)-indistinguishability between distributions of random variables.\nDefinition 2.1 ((\u03b7,\u03c4)-indstinguishability).

A straightforward application of the union bound would not be appropriate in an adaptive setting since, at each step of the k-fold composition, conditioning on the previous outputs effectively changes the data distribution.\nTo simplify our proof, we will use the slightly stronger version of the definition of typically stable algorithms (Definition 2.3) where the indistinguishability holds between the distributions of the output of the algorithm and that of an oracle that operates on the true data distribution rather than the dataset.\nThe high-level idea of the proof is as follows. Suppose X \u223c P. Let Zi = (Z1, . . . ,Zi) denote the output ofMi(X) and Z\u0303i = (Z\u03031, . . . , Z\u0303i) denote the output ofW i(P) = (W1(P), . . . ,Wi(P)) whereWi(P) is the oracle corresponding to Ai(\u00b7,Zi\u22121). At each step i of the composition, we prune the bad set of pairs (X,Zi\u22121) for which the distribution of the output of Ai(X,Zi\u22121) is not \u03b7-indistinguishable from that ofWi(P) (the oracle corresponding toAi(\u00b7,Zi\u22121)). By doing so at each step i = 1, . . . , j, then at step j, we are left with a good set for which this indistinguishability condition holds for all i \u2208 [j]. We then use a standard concentration inequality (Azuma\u2019s inequality; see Theorem 3.4) to argue that by removing another tiny portion (of small measure) from that good set, we can ensure that the joint distribution of ( X,Mj(X) ) is \u03b7j-indistinguishable from the joint distribution of ( X,W j(P) ) . We then apply a useful lemma from [KS14] (see Lemma 3.6) to argue typical stability ofMj . In our proof, in order to bound the measure of the bad set as we go from one step of the composition to the next, we use induction. Lemma 3.7 serves as the induction step where we bound the additional \u201cbad\u201d measure we need to prune as we go from step j to step j + 1."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Proof of Theorem 3.2", "text": "Fix some P \u2208 P .

As a special case, we get typically stable algorithms for releasing low-sensitivity queries as well. The algorithms are based on adding Laplace and Gaussian noise to the output of the query, and hence such algorithms are very similar to their differntially private counterparts. However, the added noise is calibrated differently from the case of differential privacy. Rather than calibrating the noise based on the global (or smooth) sensitivity of the query, the noise here is added based on the concentration radius of the query output, that is, based on how well the query output is concentrated around its mean with respect to the underlying\ndistribution on the data. In particular, for the class of \u03b3n-concentrated queries, to achieve typical stability with \u03bd =O ( e\u2212\u03b3n(\u03b1) ) , the noise is calibrated based on \u03b1, namely, the magnitude (standard deviation) of the noise is chosen to be \u2248 \u03b1/\u03b7. The intution here is that the added noise aims to conceal the identity of the specific input sample x among other typical samples (that occur with probability greater than 1\u2212 \u03bd). Nonetheless, the output would still provide information about the set of typical samples as a whole. Such information depends on the distribution rather than the sample.\nAlthough we only describe algorithms for releasing one-dimensional real-valued queries, the extension to multiple dimensions should not be difficult. In such case, the added noise will be proportional to the L1 concentration radius in the Laplace mechanism, and proportional to the L2 concentration radius in the Gaussian mechanism. However, this would require extending the definition of the query class to the multiple-dimension setting. To keep our focus on the properties of typical stability, we will not discuss here the higher dimensional extensions of these algorithms.\nLet P be any distribution over X n. Algorithm 2 describes a Laplace-noise mechanism that achieves (\u03b7,0,\u03bd)-typical stability with respect to P for releasing any \u03b3n-concentrated query with respect to P, i.e., for releasing any query in Q\u03b3n(P).\nTheorem 4.1 (Typical Stability of the Modified Laplace Mechanism).

This can be shown be choosing the oracle associated with Algorithm 3 to be the mechanism that addN ( 0,\u03c32 ) noise to E\nT\u223cP [q(T )] and outputs the result.\nTheorem 4.4 (Empirical Error of the Modified Gaussian Mechanism). With probability at least 1\u2212\u03b2 with respect to the random coins of Algorithm 3, the output w satisfies |w \u2212 q(x)| < 4\u03b1 \u221a\nlog(1/\u03c4) log(1/\u03b2) \u03b7 .\nWe note that with appropriate setting of the parameters in the algorithms above, one would obtain typically stable algorithms for releasing low-sensitivity queries. We also note that in such case, the algorithms will be typically stable with respect to all product distributions on X n."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "We would like to thank Adam Smith for the helpful discussion and for pointing us to the conditioning lemma of [KS14] which we used in our proof for the adaptive composition guarantees of typical stability."}], "references": [{"title": "Algorithmic stability for adaptive data analysis", "author": ["Raef Bassily", "Kobbi Nissim", "Adam Smith", "Uri Stemmer", "Thomas Steinke", "Jonathan Ullman"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Bassily et al\\.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bassily et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Adaptive learning with robust generalization guarantees. arXiv:1602.07726v1, Feb. 2016", "author": ["Rachel Cummings", "Katrina Ligett", "Kobbi Nissim", "Aaron Roth", "Zhiwei Steven Wu"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Cummings et al\\.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Cummings et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Generalization in adaptive data analysis and holdout reuse", "author": ["Cynthia Dwork", "Vitaly Feldman", "Moritz Hardt", "Toniann Pitassi", "Omer Reingold", "Aaron Roth"], "venue": "In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS),", "citeRegEx": "Dwork et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dwork et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Preserving statistical validity in adaptive data analysis", "author": ["Cynthia Dwork", "Vitaly Feldman", "Moritz Hardt", "Toniann Pitassi", "Omer Reingold", "Aaron Roth"], "venue": "In ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC)", "citeRegEx": "Dwork et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dwork et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "The reusable holdout: Preserving validity in adaptive data analysis", "author": ["Cynthia Dwork", "Vitaly Feldman", "Moritz Hardt", "Toniann Pitassi", "Omer Reingold", "Aaron Roth"], "venue": "Science,", "citeRegEx": "Dwork et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dwork et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Our data, ourselves: Privacy via distributed noise generation", "author": ["Cynthia Dwork", "Krishnaram Kenthapadi", "Frank McSherry", "Ilya Mironov", "Moni Naor"], "venue": "In EUROCRYPT,", "citeRegEx": "Dwork et al\\.,? \\Q2006\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dwork et al\\.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Calibrating noise to sensitivity in private data analysis", "author": ["Cynthia Dwork", "Frank McSherry", "Kobbi Nissim", "Adam Smith"], "venue": "In TCC,", "citeRegEx": "Dwork et al\\.,? \\Q2006\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dwork et al\\.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "The algorithmic foundations of differential privacy", "author": ["Cynthia Dwork", "Aaron Roth"], "venue": "Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science,", "citeRegEx": "Dwork and Roth.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dwork and Roth.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Boosting and differential privacy", "author": ["Cynthia Dwork", "Guy N.

When our goal is to release real-valued queries (statistics) computed over a dataset, this notion does not require the queries to be of bounded sensitivity \u2013 a condition that is generally assumed under a standard notion of algorithmic stability known as differential privacy [DMNS06, Dwo06]. Instead, typical stability requires the output of the query, when computed on a dataset drawn from the underlying distribution, to be \u201cwell-concentrated\u201d around its expected value with respect to that distribution. Typical stability can also be motivated as an alternative definition for database privacy (in such case, we call it typical privacy). Like differential privacy, this notion enjoys several important properties including robustness to post-processing and adaptive composition. We also discuss the guarantees of typical stability on the generalization error (i.e., the difference between the value of the query computed on the dataset and the expected value of the query with respect to the true data distribution). We show that these guarantees hold for a broader class of queries than that of bounded-sensitivity queries. This class contains all queries whose output distributions have a \u201clight\u201d tail, e.g., subgaussian and subexponential queries. In particular, we show that if a typically stable interaction with a dataset yields a query from that class, then this query when evaluated on the same dataset will have small generalization error with high probability (i.e., it will not overfit to the dataset). We discuss the composition guarantees of typical stability and prove a composition theorem that gives a characterization of the degradation of the parameters of typical stability/privacy under k-fold adaptive composition. We also give simple noise-addition algorithms that achieve this notion. These algorithms are similar to their differentially private counterparts, however, the added noise is calibrated differently. \u2217University of California San Diego, Center for Information Theory and Applications and Department of Computer Science and Engineering. rbassily@ucsd.edu \u2020University of California San Diego, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. yfreund@eng.ucsd.edu ar X iv :1 60 4. 03 33 6v 1 [ cs .L G ] 1 2 A pr 2 01 6", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
