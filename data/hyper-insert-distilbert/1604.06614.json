Judgment aggregation problems originate in political theory and public choice, however they also occur in various areas of artificial intelligence, as a consequence of the increased distributivity of computing systems and social networks, together with the rise of artificial agency. Judgment aggregation generalises voting and preference aggregation [8, 21], and has links with belief revision [16, 30] as well as abstract argumentation [4, 1, 3, 2]. For an overview of applications of judgment aggregation in artificial intelligence see for instance the work by Grossi and Pigozzi [17] or Endriss [12].\nThe main focus of research in judgment aggregation is the development and analysis of judgement aggregation operators. Numerous impossibility results \u2013 see the survey by List and Puppe [23] for an overview \u2013 have dashed the hope of finding a universally applicable operator. Consequently, the suitability of an operator for a given judgment aggregation problem has to be identified with respect to the desirable properties that the aggregation process should satisfy.\nOne of the better studied properties for operators in judgment aggregation is the independence property, which essentially dictates that the collective judgment on any one issue in the agenda should not depend on the individual judgments given on any of the other issues in the same agenda. Independence is a desirable property because, among other reasons, it is a necessary condition for strategyproofness [10], and it leads to rules that are both conceptually simple and easy to compute. However, independence is too strong; in particular, together with mild additional conditions, it implies dictatorship [8].\nWe propose a natural weakening of independence, named agenda separability. A judgment aggregation rule satisfies it if, whenever the agenda is composed of several independent sub-agendas (with an extreme form of independence being when the sub-agendas are syntactically unrelated to each other), the resulting collective judgment sets can be computed separately for each sub-agenda and then put together. Resorting to syntactically independent sub-languages is reminiscent of Parikh\u2019s language splitting [28], where decomposing a logical theory into several subtheories over disjoint sub-languages simplifies many tasks in knowledge representation, such as belief change [29] or inconsistency handling [5].\nThe agenda separability property is very intuitive and motivations for it can be easily found. For instance, in computational linguistics, we may want to aggregate annotations from several agents about parts of texts [18]; then, finding collective annotations about parts of two unrelated texts can (and should) be performed independently. When a rule satisfies agenda separability, it also becomes computationally simpler when applied to decomposable agendas, because the rule can be applied independently to every subagenda of the decomposition. Agenda separability also offers a weak form of strategyproofness: no agent is able to influence the outcome on some issue from one subagenda of the partition by strategically reporting judgments about another subagenda.\nOf course, a weakening of independence is meaningful only if there are rules that satisfy it. Not only we show that this is the case, but we also show that agenda separability is discriminant, in the sense that among the known judgment aggregation rules, some satisfy it and some do not. This leads us to see agenda independence as a possible means of choosing a judgment aggregation rule against another.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the background. Section 3 discusses the independence property. In Sections 4 and 5 we define two notions of agenda separability, and we identify some rules that satisfy them and some that do not. Section 6 contains a summary and discussion."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "Let L be a set of well-formed propositional logical formulas, including \u22a4 (tautology) and \u22a5 (contradiction). An issue is a pair of formulas \u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5 where \u03d5 \u2208 L and \u03d5 is neither a tautology nor a contradiction. An agenda A is a finite set of issues and has the form A = {\u03d51,\u00ac\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5m,\u00ac\u03d5m}. The preagenda [A] associated with A is [A] = {\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5m}. A sub-agenda is a subset of issues from A. A sub-preagenda is a subset of [A]. An agenda usually comes with an integrity constraint \u0393, which is a consistent formula whose role is to filter out inadmissible judgment sets. (A,\u0393) is called a constrained agenda. As a classical example, given a set of candidates C = {x1, . . . , xm}, the preference agenda over C [8] is AC = {xiPxj |1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 m}, and the associated integrity constraint is \u0393C = \u2227\ni,j,k (xiPxj \u2227 xjPxk \u2192 xiPxk). When \u0393 is not specified, by default it is equal to \u22a4.\nA judgment on \u03d5 \u2208 [A] is one of \u03d5 or \u00ac\u03d5. A judgment set J is a subset of A. J is complete iff for each \u03d5 \u2208 [A], either \u03d5 \u2208 J or \u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 J . A judgment set J (and in general, a set of propositional formulas) is \u0393-consistent if and only if J \u222a {\u0393} 2 \u22a5. Let JA,\u0393 be the set of all complete and consistent judgment sets. To lighten the notations, we will generally say that a judgment set is consistent instead of \u0393-consistent, and note JA instead of JA,\u0393.\nA profile P = \u3008J1, . . . , Jn\u3009 \u2208 J nA is a collection of complete and consistent individual judgment sets. We further define N(P, \u03d5) = |{i | \u03d5 \u2208 Ji}| to be the number of all agents in P whose judgment set includes \u03d5. The order %P is the weak order over A defined by \u03d5 %P \u03c6 if and only if N(P, \u03d5) \u2265 N(P, \u03c6).\nThe restriction of P = \u3008J1, . . . , Jn\u3009 over a sub-agenda A1 of A is defined as P\u2193A1 = \u3008J1 \u2229 A1, . . . , Jn \u2229A1\u3009.\nEvery consistent subset of the agenda S \u2282 A can be extended in order to obtain a complete judgment set (there might be several such extensions). For a set S of subsets of agenda , we define ext(S) = {J \u2208 JA | there exists J \u2032 \u2208 S such that J \u2032 \u2286 J}.\nA judgment aggregation rule, for n agents, is a function R that maps any constrained agenda (A,\u0393) and any profile P \u2208 J nA,\u0393 to a non-empty set of complete consistent judgment sets over A.1 If R always outputs a singleton then it is called a resolute rule. The majori-\n1The reason why the (constrained) agenda is an argument of rules is that the notions we study need a\ntarian judgment set associated with profile P contains all elements of the agenda that are supported by a majority of judgment sets in P : m(P ) = {\u03d5 \u2208 A | N(P, \u03d5) > n2 }. A profile P is majority-consistent iff m(P ) is consistent.\nLet S \u2286 L. We define Atoms(S) as the set of all propositional variables appearing in S. For example, Atoms({p, q \u2227 r,\u00acs\u2192 \u00ac\u00acp}) = {p, q, r, s}.\nGiven a set of formulas S and a formula \u0393, S\u2032 \u2286 S is \u0393-consistent if S\u2032\u222a{\u0393} is consistent, S\u2032 is a maximal \u0393-consistent subset of S, if S\u2032 is \u0393-consistent and there is no S\u2032\u2032 \u2283 S\u2032, S\u2032\u2032 \u2286 S that is \u0393-consistent. . We use max(S,\u2286) to denote the maximal consistent subsets of S. The set S\u2032 \u2286 S is a maxcard \u0393-consistent subset of S if S\u2032 is \u0393-consistent and there exists no \u0393-consistent set S\u2032\u2032 \u2286 S such that |S\u2032| < |S\u2032\u2032|. We use max(S, |.|) to denote the maxcard consistent subsets of S.\nWe now give the definitions of seven judgment aggregation rules. They come from various places in the literature, where they sometimes appear with different names [20, 21, 26, 27, 24, 15].\nThroughout the subsection, P = \u3008J1, . . . , Jn\u3009 is a profile. For two consistent and complete judgment sets J, J \u2032 we denote their Hamming distance as dH(J, J \u2032) = |J \\ J \u2032|.\nmc,mcc. The maximum Condorcet rule (mc) and the maxcard Condorcet rule (mcc) rules are defined as follows. For every agenda A, for every profile P \u2208 J nA, mc(P ) = {ext(S) | S \u2208 max(m(P ),\u2286)} and mcc(P ) = {ext(S) | S \u2208 max(m(P ), |.|)}.\nra. For A = {\u03c81, . . . , \u03c82m} and a permutation \u03c3 of {1, . . . , 2m}, let >\u03c3 be the linear order on A defined by \u03c8\u03c3(1) >\u03c3 ... >\u03c3 \u03c8\u03c3(2m). We say that >\u03c3 is compatible with %P if \u03c8\u03c3(1) %P ... %P \u03c8\u03c3(2m). The ranked agenda rule ra is defined as J \u2208 ra(P ) if and only if there exists a permutation \u03c3 such that >\u03c3 is compatible with %P and such that J = J\u03c3 is obtained by the following procedure:\n\u2022 S := \u2205; \u2022 for j = 1, . . . , 2m do \u2022 if S \u222a {\u03c8\u03c3(j)} is consistent, let S := S \u222a {\u03c8\u03c3(j)}; \u2022 J\u03c3 := S.\nRdH ,max(P ) = argmin J\u2208JA n max i=1 dH(Ji, J).\nRS. A scoring function [7] is defined as s : JA \u00d7 A \u2192 R +.

If\nwe choose the reversal scoring function srev(Ji, \u03d5) as the minimal number of judgment reversals needed in Ji in order to reject \u03d5 then we get the reversal scoring rule Rrev [7]. If we choose the scoring function s defined by smed(Ji, \u03d5) = 1 if \u03d5 \u2208 Ji and 0 if \u03d5 /\u2208 Ji then Rs is exactly the median rule, i.e. Rs \u2261 med.\nmed(P ) =\nargmax J\u2208JA\n\u2211\n\u03d5\u2208J\nN(P, \u03d5) = argmin J\u2208JA\n\u2211\nJi\u2208P\ndH(Ji, J).\nfullH.

We omit writing A,\u0393 as an argument of R when defining R to improve the readability of the text.\nThe rules defined here are irresolute, but similarly as in voting theory, can be made resolute by composing them with a tie-breaking mechanism. A simple way of defining a tiebreaking mechanism \u03b8 is via a priority relation >\u03b8 over consistent and complete judgment sets. Given an irresolute rule R and a tie-breaking mechanism \u03b8, the resolute rule R\u03b8 is the rule that, given P , returns the maximal (with respect to >\u03b8) element of R(P )."}, {"heading": "3 Relaxing Independence", "text": "A judgment aggregation rule F satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) if for every two profiles P, P \u2032 \u2208 J nA , and every \u03d5 \u2208 A, if P\u2193{\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5} = P \u2032 \u2193{\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5}, then \u03d5 \u2208 F (P ) iff \u03d5 \u2208 F (P \u2032). Independence is a very strong property: together with three seemingly innocuous properties, namely universal domain (F is defined for every profile), unanimity principle, and collective rationality (F outputs complete and consistent judgment sets), it implies dictatorship [8].\nIn [25] a relaxation of IIA is proposed, called Independence of Irrelevant Propositional Alternatives (IIPA). IIPA is the requirement that for every P, P \u2032 \u2208 J nA , and every \u03d5 \u2208 A that is either an atom or a negation of an atom, if P\u2193{\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5} = P \u2032 \u2193{\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5}, then \u03d5 \u2208 F (P ) iff \u03d5 \u2208 F (P \u2032). However [25] also shows that IIPA, modulo some conditions on the agenda, is not consistent with the unanimity preservation requirement.\nNow, while it is natural to expect that the individual judgments on logically related issues will influence the choice of collective judgments for those issues, it is also natural to expect that individual judgments over logically unrelated issues will have no impact on them. To illustrate this point, we give an example from a collective decision making problem that occurs in crowdcomputing.\nThere are a lot of tasks that are rather simple for a human to do, but fairly complicated for a computer, such as labelling images, choosing the best out of several images, identifying music segments etc. These types of tasks are called human intelligence tasks (hits). Considering the task of cataloguing pictures by location, that is outsourced as hits to an unspecified, but finite, group of people. The people undertaking these tasks should label each photo in a series and also indicate reasons for their labelling. For example: the photo is of Paris (p) if the Eiffel tower can be seen on it (e) or the Triumphal arc can be seen on it (t); the photo is of Rome (r) if the Colosseum can be seen on it (c) or the Spanish Steps can be seen on it (s). The commissioner of the hits will aggregate the individual labelings and assign the labels that are collectively supported. The problem of finding which labelings are collectively supported can be solved as a judgment aggregation problem; see the work by Endriss and Ferna\u0301ndez [14] for a similar view of crowdsourcing as a judgment aggregation problem. Assume, for simplicity, that we have three labellers (or agents) and two pictures. Furthermore, the commissioner is only interested in whether the first photo is of Paris and whether the second one is of Rome. The problem for the first photo is represented with the agenda [A1] = {p, e, t, e\u2228t\u2192 p}, while the problem for the second photo is represented with the agenda [A2] = {r, c, s, c\u2228s\u2192 r}. Observe that Atoms(A1)\u2229Atoms(A2) = \u2205. The agents get the pictures at the same time. Clearly, whether the first picture is of Paris or not has nothing to do with whether the second picture is of Rome or not, consequently we would expect that the collective judgments regarding issues in A1 depend only on the judgments given for these issues, but not on the individual judgments given for issues in A2.\nIn the next section we relax independence along this principle, defining a new property called agenda separability."}, {"heading": "4 Agenda Separability", "text": "Following the idea that only judgments on logically related issues should influence the collective judgment on each issue, we define agenda separability as the property requiring that when two agendas can be split into sub-agendas that are independent from each other, the output judgment sets can be obtained by first applying the rule on each sub-agenda separately and then taking the pairwise unions of judgment sets from the two resulting sets.\nA partition {A1,A2} of A is an independent partition of A if for every J1 \u2208 JA1 and J2 \u2208 JA2 , J 1 \u222a J2 is \u0393-consistent.2\nDefinition 1 (Agenda separability) We say that rule R satisfies agenda separability (as) if for every agenda A, every independent partition {A1,A2} of A, and all profiles P \u2208 J nA , we have\nR(P ) = {J1 \u222a J2 | J1 \u2208 R(P\u2193A1) and J 2 \u2208 R(P\u2193A2)}.\nIf R is a resolute rule, then the last line of the definition simplifies into R(P ) = R(P\u2193A1 )\u222a R(P\u2193A2).\nAlso, by associativity of \u222a, this notion generalises to agendas that can be partitioned into a collection {A1, . . . ,Ak} such that for every J1 \u2208 JA1 , . . . , Jk \u2208 JAk , J1 \u222a . . . \u222a Jk is consistent.

We show that agenda separability restricted to resolute rules is a weakening of IIA.\nProposition 1 Any resolute judgment aggregation rule that satisfies IIA is agenda separable.\nProof. If a resolute rule R satisfies IIA, we can write R(P ) = \u22c3m\ni=1 Fi(P\u2193{\u03d5i,\u00ac\u03d5i}) where [A] = {\u03d51, . . . \u03d5m} and F1, . . . , Fm are resolute rules. Let {A1,A2} be an independent partition of A. Without loss of generality, assume [A1] = {\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5k} and [A2] = {\u03d5k+1, . . . , \u03d5m}. We have R(P ) = \u22c3k i=1 Fi(P\u2193{\u03d5i,\u00ac\u03d5i}) \u222a \u22c3m\ni=k+1 Fi(P\u2193{\u03d5i,\u00ac\u03d5i}) = R(P\u2193A1) \u222aR(P\u2193A2).\nWe shall see that the reverse implication does not hold.\nDefinition 2 The scoring function s is separable if for every A and every independent partition {A1,A2} of A, for i \u2208 {1, 2}, and every J \u2208 JA and \u03d5 \u2208 Ai, we have s(J, \u03d5) = s(J \u2229Ai, \u03d5).\nWe omit the easy proofs of the next two results.\nProposition 2 If s is a separable scoring function, then RS is agenda separable.\nCorollary 1 med and Rrev are agenda separable.\n2A stronger notion of independence, which makes sense only when \u0393 = \u22a4, is syntactical agenda independence: a partition {A1,A2} of A is syntactically independent if Atoms(A1) \u2229 Atoms(A2) = \u2205. Clearly, syntactical agenda independence implies agenda independence, because Atoms(A1)\u2229 Atoms(A2) = \u2205 implies that A1 and A2 are independent. Note that the implication is strict: for example, let A = {x,\u00acx, x \u2194 y,\u00ac(x \u2194 y)} = A1 \u222a A2, \u0393 = \u22a4, A1 = {x,\u00acx} and A2 = {x \u2194 y,\u00ac(x \u2194 y)}. {A1,A2} is an independent partition of A although Atoms(A1) \u2229 Atoms(A2) 6= \u2205.\nProposition 3 mc, mcc, ra, and fullH are agenda separable. R dH ,max is not agenda separable.\nProof. For mc and ra, this will be a consequence of a stronger result proven in Section 5, therefore we give a proof only for mcc and fullH . Let {A1,A2} be an independent partition of A. mcc. Denote B1 = m(P1), B2 = m(P2) and B = m(P ). Let \u03a0P1,P2 = {J\n1 \u222a J2 | J1 \u2208 mcc(P1) and J\n2 \u2208 mcc(P2)}. We first show that mcc(P ) \u2286 \u03a0P1,P2 . Let J\u2217 \u2208 mcc(P ); thus J\u2217 \u2208 ext(max(B, |.|)). Let J 1 \u2217 = J\u2217 \u2229 A1 and J 2 \u2217 = J\u2217 \u2229 A2. J 1 \u2217 and J 2 \u2217 are consistent, because J\u2217 is consistent. Assume J 1 \u2217 /\u2208 ext(max(B1, |.|)). Since J 1 \u2217 is consistent, there exists J1\u2217\u2217 \u2208 ext(max(B1, |.|)) such that |J 1 \u2217\u2217| > |J 1 \u2217 |. Let J\u2217\u2217 = J 1 \u2217\u2217 \u222a J 2 \u2217 . Because {A1,A2} is an independent partition of A, the consistency of J1\u2217\u2217 and of J 2 \u2217 implies the consistency of J\u2217\u2217. But then |J\u2217\u2217| > |J\u2217|, which contradicts J\u2217 \u2208 ext(max(B, |.|)). Therefore, J1\u2217 \u2208 ext(max(B1, |.|)). Similarly, J2\u2217 \u2208 ext(max(B2, |.|)). Thus, J\u2217 \u2208 \u03a0P1,P2 .\nNow we show that \u03a0P1,P2 \u2286 mcc(P ). Let J 1 \u2208 mcc(P1) and J2 \u2208 mcc(P2), that is, J1 \u2208 ext(max(B1, |.|)) and J2 \u2208 ext(max(B2, |.|)). Let us show that J = J1 \u222a J2 \u2208 ext(max(B, |.|)). Because {A1,A2} is an independent partition of A, J is consistent. Suppose that there exists J\u2217 \u2208 ext(max(B, |.|)) such that |J\u2217| > |J |. Let J1\u2217 = J\u2217 \u2229 B1 and J2\u2217 = J\u2217 \u2229 B2. Both J 1 \u2217 and J 2 \u2217 are consistent, and |J\u2217| > |J | implies that |J 1 \u2217\u2217| > |J 1 \u2217 | or |J2\u2217\u2217| > |J 2 \u2217 |, which contradicts J 1 \u2217 /\u2208 ext(max(B1, |.|)) and J 2 \u2217 /\u2208 ext(max(B2, |.|)).

We first show that fullH(P ) \u2286 UA12. Let J\u25e6 \u2208 fullH(P ). Let J1\u25e6 = J\u25e6 \u2229 A1 and J2\u25e6 = J\u25e6\u2229A2. Since J\u25e6 \u2208 fullH(P ) then there exists Q \u2208 CMC(P ) such that J\u25e6 \u2208 ext(m(Q)). Let us show that Q\u2193A1 \u2208 CMC(P\u2193A1). Suppose that Q\u2193A1 /\u2208 CMC(P\u2193A1).

Define Q\u2217 = \u3008I\u22171 \u222a I 2 1 , . . . , I \u2217 n \u222a I 2 n\u3009. Because {A1,A2} is an independent partition of A, Q\u2217 is a majority-consistent profile. Note also that DH(Q \u2217, P ) < DH(Q,P ). Contradiction. Thus, Q\u2193A1 \u2208 CMC(P\u2193A1 ), and for the same reasons, Q\u2193A2 \u2208 CMC(P\u2193A2). Therefore, J1\u25e6 \u2208 fullH(P\u2193A1 ), J 2 \u25e6 \u2208 fullH(P\u2193A2 ), and fullH \u2286 UA12.\nWe now show that UA12 \u2286 fullH . Let J1\u25e6 \u2208 fullH(P\u2193A1) and J 2 \u25e6 \u2208 fullH(P\u2193A2). Thus, there exist profiles Q1 \u2208 CMC(P\u2193A1 ) and Q2 \u2208 CMC(P\u2193A2) such that J 1 \u25e6 \u2208 ext(m(Q1)) and J2\u25e6 \u2208 ext(m(Q2)). Let Q1 = \u3008Q 1 1, . . . , Q 1 n\u3009, Q2 = \u3008Q 2 1, . . . , Q 2 n\u3009, and Q = \u3008Q 1 1 \u222aQ 2 1, . . . , Q 1 n \u222a Q2n\u3009. Because {A1,A2} is an independent partition of A, Q is majority-consistent. Let us show that Q \u2208 CMC(P ). Assume that Q /\u2208 CMC(P ). Then there exists Q\u2217 \u2208 CMC(P ) s.t. DH(Q\u2217, P ) < DH(Q,P ). Observe that DH(Q\u2217\u2193A1 , P ) + DH(Q \u2217 \u2193A2 , P ) < DH(Q\u2193A1 , P ) + DH(Q\u2193A2 , P ). This means that DH(Q \u2217 \u2193A1 , P ) < DH(Q\u2193A1 , P ) or DH(Q \u2217 \u2193A2 , P ) < DH(Q\u2193A2 , P ). Recall that Q\u2193A1 = Q1 and Q\u2193A2 = Q2. Thus, DH(Q \u2217 \u2193A1 , P ) < DH(Q1, P ) or DH(Q \u2217 \u2193A2 , P ) < DH(Q2, P ), which, together with the fact that Q\u2217\u2193A1 and Q \u2217 \u2193A2 are majority-consistent, contradicts Q1 \u2208 CMC(P\u2193A1 ) and Q2 \u2208 CMC(P\u2193A2 ). Thus, Q \u2208 CMC(P ). Note that J 1 \u25e6 \u222a J 2 \u25e6 \u2208 m(Q). This implies that J1\u25e6 \u222a J 2 \u25e6 \u2208 fullH(P ).\nRdH ,max. We provide a counter example.Let A = A1 \u222a A2 with [A1] = {p, q, p \u2227 q} and [A2] = {t}. Consider the profile P from Figure 1 with P1 = P\u2193A1 and P2 = P\u2193A2 . We obtain RdH ,max(P ) = {{\u00acp, q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q), t}}. However RdH ,max(P2) = {{t}, {\u00act}} and R dH ,max(P1) = {{\u00acp, q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}, {p, q, (p \u2227 q)}, {p,\u00acq,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}}.\nThe fact that a rule satisfies agenda separability does not imply that a resolute rule obtained by composing it with a tie-breaking mechanism satisfies agenda separability as\nwell. For instance, if tie-breaking favours {\u00aca} over {a} when A = {a}, {\u00acb} over {b} when A = {b}, and {a, b} over all other judgment sets when A = {a, b}, and if P contains one judgment set {a, b} and one judgment set {\u00aca,\u00acb}, then for any one of our rules, and with A1 = {a,\u00aca} and A2 = {b,\u00acb}, we have R(P\u2193A1) = {\u00aca}, R(P\u2193A2) = {\u00acb}, and R(P ) = {a, b}. However, if the tie-breaking priority relation >\u03b8 satisfies the following decomposability property, then agenda separability of an irresolute rule implies agenda separability of its composition with \u03b8.\nA tie-breaking priority relation >\u03b8 is agenda separable if for every agenda A, for every independent partition {A1,A2} of A, and every J1\u2217 , J 1 \u25e6 \u2208 JA1 , and J 2 \u2217 , J 2 \u25e6 \u2208 JA2 , J 1 \u2217 >\u03b8 J 1 \u25e6 and J2\u2217 >\u03b8 J 2 \u25e6 imply J 1 \u2217 \u222a J 2 \u2217 >\u03b8 J 1 \u25e6 \u222a J 2 \u25e6 .\nObservation 1 If >\u03b8 is an agenda separable tie-breaking priority relation and R is agenda separable, then R\u03b8 is agenda separable.\nLet >\u03b8 be an agenda separable tie-breaking priority relation, then ra\u03b8 is agenda separable. However, since it satisfies universal domain, unanimity principle [20], and collective rationality, then it does not satisfy IIA. Hence, the implication stated in Proposition 1 is strict.\nLastly, we would like to state two observations about the properties of rules that are agenda separable.\nObservation 2 Let K be a constant and say that agenda A is K-decomposable if A can be partitioned into p syntactically unrelated agendas A1, . . . ,Ap such that for all i |Atoms(Ai)| \u2264 K. If a rule satisfies agenda separability, then the collective judgment sets can be computed in time O(2Kn) whenever the agenda is K-decomposable.\nIn other terms, computing these rules is parameterized tractable when he parameter is the degree K of decomposability, which is a complexity gap, since winner determination for these rules is \u03982p-hard or even \u03a0 2 p-hard [22, 13].\nMoreover, agenda separability allows for a weak form of strategyproofness. Indeed, if A can be partitioned into p syntactically unrelated agendas A1, . . . ,Ap, then no agent is able to influence the outcome on some issue in Ai by reporting strategic judgments about issues of Aj for j 6= i."}, {"heading": "5 Overlapping Agenda Separability", "text": "In this section, we consider a stricter property than agenda separability. We first need the notion of independent overlapping decomposition.\nDefinition 3 (Independent overlapping decomposition) Let A be an agenda and let A = A1 \u222a A2 (but not necessarily A1 \u2229 A2 = \u2205). We say that {A1,A2} is an independent overlapping decomposition (IOD) of A if and only if for every J1 \u2208 JA1 , for every J 2 \u2208 JA2\nif J1 \u2229 A2 = J 2 \u2229 A1 then J 1 \u222a J2 \u2208 JA.\nExample 1 Let [A] = {p,\u00acp \u2228 t, p \u2194 q}, [A1] = {p,\u00acp \u2228 t} and [A2] = {\u00acp \u2228 t, p \u2194 q}. Note that {A1,A2} is an independent overlapping decomposition of A.\nObservation 3 Every independent partition is an independent overlapping decomposition.\nExample 1 shows that the contrary of the previous observation does not hold. Indeed, as soon as the intersection of the two sub-agendas is non-empty, they do not form an independent partition.\nThere is a clear connection between independent overlapping decompositions and conditional independence in propositional logic [6, 19]; we do not give technical details here, but we mention that this connection gives us several characterizations as well as complexity results for finding independent overlapping decompositions.\nWe can now introduce the definition of overlapping agenda separability.\nDefinition 4 (Overlapping agenda separability) We say that rule R satisfies overlapping agenda separability (OAS) if for every agenda A and every independent overlapping decomposition {A1,A2} of A, for every profile P over A it holds that: if for every J1 \u2208 R(P\u2193A1), for every J 2 \u2208 R(P\u2193A2), we have J 1\u2229A2 = J2\u2229A1 then R(P ) = {J1\u222aJ2 | J1 \u2208 R(P\u2193A1) and J 2 \u2208 R(P\u2193A2)}.\nObservation 4 Overlapping agenda separability implies agenda separability.\nProof. Let {A1,A2} be an independent partition of A. From Observation 3 {A1,A2} is an IOD. Since A1 \u2229 A2 = \u2205, condition J 1 \u2229 A2 = J 2 \u2229 A1 is satisfied for every J\n1, J2. Thus, R(P ) = {J1 \u222a J2 | J1 \u2208 R(P\u2193A1) and J 2 \u2208 R(P\u2193A2)}.\nProposition 4 mc and ra satisfy oas.\nProof. mc. Suppose that for every J1 \u2208 mc(P1), for every J2 \u2208 mc(P2), J1 \u2229A2 = J2 \u2229A1. Let \u03a0P1,P2 = {J\n1 \u222a J2 | J1 \u2208 mc(P1) and J2 \u2208 mc(P2)}. We first show that mc(P ) \u2286 \u03a0P1,P2 . Let J \u2208 mc(P ). Denote J\n1 = J \u2229 A1 and J2 = J \u2229 A2. We claim that J1 \u2208 mc(P1) and J2 \u2208 mc(P2). Note that J1 and J2 are consistent. By means of contradiction, and without loss of generality, assume J1 /\u2208 mc(P1). Thus, there exists J1\u22c6 \u2208 JA1 such that J 1 \u2229 m(P ) \u2282 J1\u22c6 \u2229 m(P ). Denote J\u22c6 = J 1 \u22c6 \u222a J\n2. Observe that J\u22c6 is consistent. Furthermore, J \u2229 m(P ) \u2282 J\u22c6 \u2229 m(P ), thus J /\u2208 mc(P ), contradiction.\nWe now show that \u03a0P1,P2 \u2286 mc(P ). Let J 1 \u2208 mc(P1) and J2 \u2208 mc(P2). Denote J = J1 \u222a J2. Since {A1,A2} is an IOD, J is consistent. Suppose J /\u2208 mc(P ). Thus, there exists J \u2032 \u2208 JA such that J \u2229m(P ) \u2282 J \u2032\u2229m(P ). Let \u03d5 \u2208 (J \u2032\u2229m(P ))\\ (J \u2229m(P )). Without loss of generality, assume \u03d5 \u2208 A1. Denote J1\u22c6 = J\n\u2032 \u2229 A1. Note that J1\u22c6 is consistent and J1 \u2229m(P ) \u2282 J1\u22c6 \u2229m(P ), contradiction.\nra. We give only a proof sketch. Suppose that for every J1 \u2208 ra(P1), for every J 2 \u2208 ra(P2), J 1 \u2229 A2 = J\n2 \u2229 A1. Let \u03a0P1,P2 = {J\n1\u222aJ2 | J1 \u2208 ra(P1) and J2 \u2208 ra(P2)}. Let J1 \u2208 ra(P1), J2 \u2208 ra(P2). Denote J = J1 \u222a J2. We claim that J \u2208 ra(P ). Because J1 \u2208 ra(P1), there is an order >\u03c31 on A1, refining %P1 such that J\n1 = J\u03c31 . Similarly, there is an order >\u03c32 on A2, refining %P2 , such that J2 = J\u03c32 . We first claim that without loss of generality, we can assume that >\u03c31 and >\u03c32 coincide on A1 \u2229A2. For this we construct \u03c3\n\u2032\u2032 on A2, refining %P2 , such that >\u03c3\u2032\u2032 coincides with >\u03c31 on A1 \u2229 A2 and J\u03c3\u2032\u2032 = J\u03c32 = J 2.\nNow, let >\u03c3 be an order on A refining %P and extending both >\u03c31 and >\u03c32 . Let A = {\u03b11, . . . , \u03b12m}. Without loss of generality, suppose \u03b11 >\u03c3 . . . >\u03c3 \u03b12m. Let Si \u2286 A be the set obtained at the step i of construction of J = J\u03c3. We show by induction on i that\n(Hi) \u2200j \u2208 {1, . . . , i} we have \u03b1j \u2208 Si iff \u03b1j \u2208 J 1 \u222a J2.\nFrom (H2m), we obtain J = J 1 \u222a J2.\nWe now show that ra(P ) \u2286 \u03a0P1,P2 . Suppose J \u2208 ra(P ). Let >\u03c3 be an order on A such that J = J\u03c3. Without loss of generality, suppose \u03b11 >\u03c3 . . . >\u03c3 \u03b12m. Denote by >\u03c31 (resp. >\u03c32) the restriction of >\u03c3 on A1 (resp. A2). Let J 1 = J\u03c31 and J 2 = J\u03c32 . Observe that J1 \u2229 A2 = J2 \u2229 A1. Since {A1,A2} is an IOD, J1 \u222a J2 is consistent. Let Si \u2286 A be the set obtained at the step i of construction of J = J\u03c3. We show by induction on i that\n(Hi) \u2200j \u2208 {1, . . . , i} we have \u03b1j \u2208 Si iff \u03b1j \u2208 J 1 \u222a J2.\nBy putting i = 2m, we obtain J = J1 \u222a J2.\nProposition 5 mcc, med, fullH , and Rrev do not satisfy oas.\nProof. mcc, med and fullH . We now provide a counter-example to show that mcc and med do not satisfy oas. Let [A1] = {p, p \u2192 q, p \u2192 r, q, r}, [A2] = {q, r, s, s \u2192 q, s \u2192 r}, and A = A1\u222aA2. Observe that {A1,A2} is an IOD ofA. Consider the profile from Figure 2.\nWe obtain mcc(P1) = med(P1) = fullH(P1) = { { \u00acp, p\u2192 q, p\u2192 r, \u00acq, \u00acr, } } , and mcc(P2) = med(P2) = fullH(P2) = { { \u00acs, s\u2192 q, s\u2192 r, \u00acq, \u00acr, } }\n. However, mcc(P ) = med(P ) = fullH(P ) = {{\u00acp, p \u2192 q, p \u2192 r,\u00acq,\u00acr,\u00acs, s \u2192 q, s \u2192 r}, {p, p\u2192 q, p\u2192 r, q, r, s, s\u2192 q, s\u2192 r}}.\nRrev. The proof is omitted due to space limitations.\nThe preference agenda [9] associated with a set of alternatives C = {x1, . . . , xq} is AC = {xiPxj | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 q}. When j > i, xiPxj is not a proposition of AC , but we write xjPxi as a shorthand for \u00ac(xjPxi). Conversely, given a judgment set J on AC , the binary relation \u227bJ over C is defined by: for all xi, xj \u2208 C, xi \u227bJ xj if xiPxj \u2208 J and xj \u227bJ xi if \u00acxiPxj \u2208 J .\nObservation 5 For any m \u2265 3, there exists no (non-trivial) independent overlapping decomposition of the preference agenda over the set of alternatives C = {x1, . . . , xm}.\nProof. We first establish the following lemma: if {A1,A2} is an independent overlapping decomposition, then for all xi, xj , xk, xiPxj and xiPxk are both in A1 or both in A2. Assume that it is not the case: without loss of generality, xiPxj \u2208 A1 and xiPxk \u2208 A2. Also without loss of generality, assume xjPxk \u2208 A1. Let J1 and J2 be two consistent judgment sets over A1 and A2 such that J1 contains {xiPxj , xjPxk}, J2 contains xkPxi,\nand J1 and J2 are completed in an arbitrary way such that J1 \u2229A2 = J2 \u2229A1; J1 \u222aJ2 is an inconsistent judgment set over A1 \u222aA2, which contradicts the assumption that {A1,A2} is an independent overlapping decomposition.\nAssume without loss of generality that x1Px2 \u2208 A1. Let x\u2032, x\u2032\u2032 \u2208 {x1, . . . , xk}. If x\u2032 = x1 or x \u2032\u2032 = x1 then the above lemma implies that x \u2032Px\u2032\u2032 \u2208 A1. If neither x\u2032 = x1 nor x\u2032\u2032 = x1, then the above lemma implies that x1Px \u2032 \u2208 A1, and applying the lemma again leads to x\u2032Px\u2032\u2032 \u2208 A1. This being true for all x\u2032, x\u2032\u2032, we have A1 = A, and {A1,A2} is a trivial decomposition."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "We proposed a new property for judgment aggregation, namely agenda separability. It is a relaxation of the classical independence property, and unlike it, it is satisfied by several non-degenerate judgment aggregation rules. We have defined a stronger version of agenda separability, namely overlapping agenda separability, which is even more discriminant, since we have identified only two of the previously studied judgment aggregation rules that satisfy it, namely mc and ra. Note that ra satisfied furthermore unanimity principle [20]. Also, two rules were left out of this paper due to space limitations: the judgment aggregation version of the Young rule, which does not satisfy agenda separability, and the \u2018geodesic\u2019 distance-base rule of Duddy and Piggins [11], which satisfies agenda separability but not overlapping agenda separability.\nA possible reason why agenda separability has not been studied sooner is that it is not applicable to common agendas such as the preference agenda, simply because they are not decomposable (cf. Observation 5). A similar observation would hold for other agendas of interest, such as those used for the aggregation of equivalence relations or for committee elections. However, agenda separability does apply to variants of these problems. Suppose for instance that we have to elect a committee made of K men and K women; then agenda separability applies and says that the election of the K men and the K women do not interfere.\nThis notion of agenda separability should not be confused with a notion of separability, also known as consistency or reinforcement, considered in voting theory [31] and generalized to judgment aggregation [20]: these notions say that if a profile P can be decomposed into two subprofiles P1 and P2 for which the output is the same, then this should also be the output for P .\nAn ambitious issue for further work would be characterizing the set of rules that satisfy agenda separability, or one of its variants.\nAcknowledgements.

We propose here a weakening of independence, named agenda separability: a judgment aggregation rule satisfies it if, whenever the agenda is composed of several independent sub-agendas, the resulting collective judgment sets can be computed separately for each sub-agenda and then put together. We show that this property is discriminant, in the sense that among judgment aggregation rules so far studied in the literature, some satisfy it and some do not. We briefly discuss the implications of agenda separability on the computation of judgment aggregation rules.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
