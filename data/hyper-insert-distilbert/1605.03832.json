This is unsurprising considering the historical importance of count-based models in which every surface form of a word is a separately modeled entity (English cat and Spanish gato would not likely benefit from sharing counts). However, recent models that use distributed representations\u2014in particular models that share representations across languages (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014; Faruqui and Dyer, 2014; Huang et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015, inter alia)\u2014suggest universal models applicable to multiple languages are a possibility. This paper takes a\nstep in this direction.\nWe introduce polyglot language models: neural network language models that are trained on and applied to any number of languages. Our goals with these models are the following. First, to facilitate data and parameter sharing, providing more training resources to languages, which is especially valuable in low-resource settings. Second, models trained on diverse languages with diverse linguistic properties will better be able to learn naturalistic representations that are less likely to \u201coverfit\u201d to a single linguistic outlier. Finally, polyglot models offer convenience in a multilingual world: a single model replaces dozens of different models.\nExploration of polyglot language models at the sentence level\u2014the traditional domain of language modeling\u2014requires dealing with a massive event space (i.e., the union of words across many languages). To work in a more tractable domain, we evaluate our model on phone-based language modeling, the modeling sequences of sounds, rather than words. We choose this domain since a common assumption of many theories of phonology is that all spoken languages construct words from a finite inventory of phonetic symbols (represented conveniently as the elements of the the International Phonetic Alphabet; IPA) which are distinguished by language-universal features (e.g., place and manner of articulation, voicing status, etc.). Although our focus is on sound sequences, our solution can be ported to the semantic/syntactic problem as resulting from adaptation to constraints on semantic/syntactic structure.\nThis paper makes two primary contributions: in\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n03 83\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n2 M\nay 2\nmodeling and in applications. In \u00a72, we introduce a novel polyglot neural language model (NLM) architecture. Despite being trained on multiple languages, the multilingual model is more effective (9.5% lower perplexity) than individual models, and substantially more effective than naive baselines (over 25% lower perplexity). Our most effective polyglot architecture conditions not only on the identity of the language being predicted in each sequence, but also on a vector representation of its phono-typological properties. In addition to learning representations of phones as part of the polyglot language modeling objective, the model incorporates features about linguistic typology to improve generalization performance (\u00a73). Our second primary contribution is to show that downstream applications are improved by using polyglotlearned phone representations. We focus on two tasks: predicting adapted word forms in models of cross-lingual lexical borrowing and speech synthesis (\u00a74). Our experimental results (\u00a75) show that in borrowing, we improve over the current stateof-the-art, and in speech synthesis, our features are more effective than manually-designed phonetic features. Finally, we analyze the phonological content of learned representations, finding that our polyglot models discover standard phonological categories such as length and nasalization, and that these are grouped correctly across languages with different phonetic inventories and contrastive features."}, {"heading": "2 Model", "text": "In this section, we first describe in \u00a72.1 the underlying framework of our model\u2014RNNLM\u2014a standard recurrent neural network based language model (Mikolov et al., 2010; Sundermeyer et al., 2012). Then, in \u00a72.2, we define a Polyglot LM\u2014a modification of RNNLM to incorporate language information, both learned and hand-crafted.\nProblem definition. In the phonological LM, phones (sounds) are the basic units. Mapping from words to phones is defined in pronunciation dictionaries. For example, \u201ccats\u201d [k\u00e6ts] is a sequence of four phones. Given a prefix of phones \u03c61, \u03c62, . . . , \u03c6t\u22121, the task of the LM is to estimate the conditional probability of the next phone p(\u03c6t | \u03c61, \u03c62, . . . , \u03c6t\u22121)."}, {"heading": "2.1 RNNLM", "text": "In NLMs, a vocabulary V (here, a set of phones composing all word types in the language) is represented as a matrix of parameters X \u2208 Rd\u00d7|V |, with |V | phone types represented as d-dimensional vectors. X is often denoted as lookup table. Phones in the input sequence are first converted to phone vectors, where \u03c6i is represented by xi by multiplying the phone indicator (one-hot vector of length |V |) and the lookup table.\nAt each time step t, most recent phone prefix vector1 xt and hidden state ht\u22121 are transformed to compute a new hidden representation:\nht = f(xt,ht\u22121),\nwhere f is a non-linear transformation. In the original RNNLMs (Mikolov et al., 2010), the transformation is such that:\nht = tanh(Whxxt + Whhht\u22121 + bh).\nTo overcome the notorious problem in recurrent neural networks of vanishing gradients (Bengio et al., 1994), following Sundermeyer et al. (2012), in recurrent layer we use long short-term memory (LSTM) units (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997):2\nht = LSTM(xt,ht\u22121).\nGiven the hidden sequence ht, the output sequence is then computed as follows:\np(\u03c6t = i | \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6t\u22121) = softmax(Woutht + bout)i,\nwhere softmax(xi) = e xi\u2211 j e xj ensures a valid probability distribution over output phones.\n1 We are reading at each time step the most recent n-gram context rather than\u2014as is more common in RNNLMs\u2014a single phone context. Empirically, this works better for phone sequences, and we hypothesize that this lets the learner rely on direct connections for local phenomena (which are abundant in phonology) and minimally use the recurrent state to model longer-range effects.\n2For brevity, we omit the equations describing the LSTM cells; they can be found in (Graves, 2013, eq. 7\u201311)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Polyglot LM", "text": "We now describe our modifications to RNNLM to account for multilinguality.

The typological feature vector will be discussed in the following section.\nThe input layer is passed to the hidden localcontext layer:\nct = Wcxxt + Wclangxlang + bc.\nThe local-context vector is then passed to the hidden LSTM global-context layer, similarly to the previously described RNNLM:\ngt = LSTM(ct,gt\u22121).\nIn the next step, the global-context vector gt is \u201cfactored\u201d by the typology of the training language, to integrate manually-defined language features. To obtain this, we first project the (potentially highdimensional) t` into a low-dimensional vector, and apply non-linearity.

We evaluate phone vectors learned by Polyglot LMs in two downstream applications that rely on phonology: modeling lexical borrowing (\u00a74.1) and speech synthesis (\u00a74.2)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Lexical borrowing", "text": "Lexical borrowing is the adoption of words from another language, that inevitably happens when speakers of different languages communicate for a long period of time (Thomason and Kaufman, 2001). Borrowed words\u2014also called loan-\nwords\u2014constitute 10\u201370% of most language lexicons (Haspelmath, 2009); these are content words of foreign origin that are adapted in the language and are not perceived as foreign by language speakers. Computational modeling of cross-lingual transformations of loanwords is effective for inferring lexical correspondences across languages with limited parallel data, benefiting applications such as machine translation (Tsvetkov and Dyer, 2015; Tsvetkov and Dyer, 2016).\nIn the process of their nativization in a foreign language, loanwords undergo primarily phonological adaptation, namely insertion/deletion/substitution of phones to adapt to the phonotactic constraints of the recipient language. If a foreign phone is not present in the recipient language, it is usually replaced with its closest native equivalent\u2014we thus hypothesize that cross-lingual phonological features learned by the Polyglot LM can be useful in models of borrowing to quantify cross-lingual similarities of sounds.\nTo test this hypothesis, we augment the handengineered models proposed by Tsvetkov and Dyer (2016) with features from phone vectors learned by our model. Inputs to the borrowing framework are loanwords (in Swahili, Romanian, Maltese), and outputs are their corresponding \u201cdonor\u201d words in the donor language (Arabic, French, Italian, resp.). The framework is implemented as a cascade of finitestate transducers with insertion/deletion/substitution operations on sounds, weighted by high-level conceptual linguistic constraints that are learned in a supervised manner. Given a loanword, the system produces a candidate donor word with lower ranked violations than other candidates, using the shortest path algorithm. In the original borrowing model, insertion/deletion/substitution operations are unweighted. In this work, we integrate transition weights in the phone substitution transducers, which are cosine distances between phone vectors learned by our model. Our intuition is that similar sounds appear in similar contexts, even if they are not present in the same language (e.g., /sQ/ in Arabic is adapted to /s/ in Swahili). Thus, if our model effectively captures cross-lingual signals, similar sounds should have smaller distances in the vector space, which can improve the shortest path results. Figure 2 illustrates our modifications to the\noriginal framework."}, {"heading": "4.2 Speech synthesis", "text": "Speech synthesis is the process of converting text into speech. It has various applications, such as screen readers for the visually impaired and handsfree voice based systems. Text-to-speech (TTS) systems are also used as part of speech-to-speech translation systems and spoken dialog systems, such as personal digital assistants. Natural and intelligible TTS systems exist for a number of languages in the world today. However, building TTS systems remains prohibitive for many languages due to the lack of linguistic resources and data.\nThe language-specific resources that are traditionally used for building TTS systems in a new language are: (1) audio recordings with transcripts; (2) pronunciation lexicon or letter to sound rules; and (3) a phone set definition. Standard TTS systems today use phone sets designed by experts. Typically, these phone sets also contain phonetic features for each phoneme, which are used as features in models of the spectrum and prosody. The phonetic features available in standard TTS systems are multidimensional vectors indicating various properties of each phoneme, such as whether it is a vowel or consonant, vowel length and height, place of articulation of a consonant, etc. Constructing these features by hand can be labor intensive, and coming up with such features automatically may be useful in low-resource scenarios.\nIn this work, we replace manually engineered phonetic features with phone vectors, which are then\nused by classification and regression trees for modeling the spectrum. Each phoneme in our phone set is assigned an automatically constructed phone vector, and each member of the phone vector is treated as a phoneme-level feature which is used in place of the manually engineered phonetic features. While prior work has explored TTS augmented with acoustic features (Watts et al., 2015), to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to replace manually engineered phonetic features in TTS systems with automatically constructed phone vectors."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "Our experimental evaluation of our proposed polyglot models consists of two parts: (i) an intrinsic evaluation where phone sequences are modeled with independent models and (ii) an extrinsic evaluation of the learned phonetic representations.

We experiment with the following languages: Arabic (AR), French (FR), Hindi (HI), Italian (IT), Maltese (MT), Romanian (RO), Swahili (SW), Tamil (TA), and Telugu (TE). In our language modeling experiments, two main sources of data are pronunciation dictionaries and typological features described in \u00a73. The dictionaries for AR, FR, HI, TA, and TE are taken from in-house speech recognition/synthesis systems. For remaining languages, the dictionaries are automatically constructed using the Omniglot grapheme-to-IPA conversion rules.4\nWe use two types of pronunciation dictionaries: (1) AR, FR, HI, IT, MT, RO, and SW dictionaries used in experiments with lexical borrowing; and (2) EN, HI, TA, and TE dictionaries used in experiments with speech synthesis. The former are mapped to IPA, with the resulting phone vocabulary size\u2014the number of distinct phones across IPA dictionaries\u2014of 127 phones. The latter are encoded using the UniTran universal transliteration resource (Qian et al., 2010), with a vocabulary of 79 phone types.\nFrom the (word-type) pronunciation dictionaries, we remove 15% of the words for development, and a further 10% for testing; the rest of the data is\n4http://omniglot.com/writing/\nused to train the models.

We used the following network architecture: 100-dimensional phone vectors, with hidden local-context and LSTM layers of size 100, and hidden language layer of size 20. All language models were trained using the left context of 3 phones (4-gram LMs). Across all language modeling experiments, parameter optimization was performed on the dev set using the Adam algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with mini-batches of size 100 to train the models for 5 epochs."}, {"heading": "5.2 Intrinsic perplexity evaluation", "text": "Perplexity is the standard evaluation measure for language models, which has been shown to correlate strongly with error rates in downstream applications (Klakow and Peters, 2002). We evaluated perplexities across several architectures, and several monolingual and multilingual setups. We kept the same hyper-parameters across all setups, as detailed in \u00a75. Perplexities of LMs trained on the two types of pronunciation dictionaries were evaluated separately; table 3 summarizes perplexities of the models trained on IPA dictionaries, and table 4 summarizes perplexities of the UniTran LMs.\nIn columns, we compare three model architectures: baseline denotes the standard RNNLM archi-\ntecture described in \u00a72.1; +lang denotes the Polyglot LM architecture described in \u00a72.2 with input language vector but without typological features and language layer; finally, +typology denotes the full Polyglot LM architecture.

First, polyglot models require, unsurprisingly, information about\nwhat language they are predicting to obtain good modeling performance. Second, typological information is more valuable than letting the model learn representations of the language along with the characters. Finally, typology-augmented polyglot models outperform their monolingual baseline, providing evidence in support of the hypothesis that cross-lingual evidence is useful not only for learning cross-lingual representations and models, but monolingual ones as well."}, {"heading": "5.3 Lexical borrowing experiments", "text": "We fully reproduced lexical borrowing models described in (Tsvetkov and Dyer, 2016) for three language pairs: AR\u2013SW, FR\u2013RO, and IT\u2013MT.

Corpora statistics are given in table 5 (note that these are extremely small data sets; thus small numbers of highly informative features a necessary for good generalization). We use the reproduced systems as the baselines, and compare these to the corresponding systems augmented with phone vectors, as described in \u00a74.1.\nIntegrated vectors were obtained from a single polyglot model with typology, trained on all languages with IPA dictionaries. For comparison with the results in table 3, perplexity of the model on the IT dataset (used for evaluation is \u00a75.2) is 4.16, even lower than in the model trained on four languages. To retrain the high-level conceptual linguistic features learned by the borrowing models, we initialized the augmented systems with feature weights learned by the baselines, and retrained. Final weights were established using cross-validation. Then, we evaluated the accuracy of the augmented borrowing systems on the held-out test data.\nAccuracies are shown in table 6.

Effectiveness of the same polyglot model trained on multiple languages and integrated in different downstream systems supports our as-\nsumption that the model remains stable and effective with addition of languages. Our model is less effective for the AR\u2013SW language pair.

The MCD metric calculates an L2 norm of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) of natural speech from a held out test set, and synthetic speech generated from the same test set. Since this is a distance metric, a lower value of MCD suggests better synthesis. The MCD is a database-specific metric, but experiments by Kominek et al. (Kominek et al., 2008) have shown that a decrease in MCD of 0.08 is perceptually significant, and a decrease of 0.12 is equivalent to doubling the size of the TTS database. In our experiments, we use MCD to measure the relative improvement obtained by our techniques.\nWe conducted experiments on the IIIT-H Hindi voice database (Prahallad et al., 2012), a 2 hour single speaker database recorded by a professional male speaker. We used the same front end (UniTran) to build all the Hindi TTS systems, with the only difference between the systems being the presence or absence of phonetic features and our vectors.

The tool aligns dimensions in a matrix of learned distributed representations with dimensions of a hand-crafted linguistic matrix. Alignments are induced via correlating columns in the distributed and the linguistic matrices. To analyze the content of the distributed matrix, annotations from the linguistic matrix are projected via the maximally-correlated alignments.\nWe constructed a phonological matrix in which 5,059 rows are IPA phones and 21 columns are boolean indicators of universal phonological properties, e.g. consonant, voiced, labial.5 We the projected annotations from the linguistic matrix and\n5This matrix is described in Littell et al.

Adaptations have been proposed to apply language models in bilingual settings in machine translation (Niehues et al., 2011) and code switching (Adel et al., 2013).
