Discovering what other people think can help us navigate through different aspects of life, ranging from making decisions on regular tasks to judging fundamental societal issues and forming personal ideology. To efficiently absorb the massive amount of opinionated information, there is a pressing need for automated systems that can generate concise and fluent opinion summary about an entity or a topic. In spite of substantial researches in opinion summarization, the most prominent approaches mainly rely on extractive summarization methods, where phrases or sentences from the original documents are selected for inclusion in the summary (Hu and Liu, 2004; Lerman et al., 2009). One of the problems that extractive methods suffer from\nis that they unavoidably include secondary or redundant information. On the contrary, abstractive summarization methods, which are able to generate text beyond the original input, can produce more coherent and concise summaries.\nIn this paper, we present an attention-based neural network model for generating abstractive summaries of opinionated text. Our system takes as input a set of text units containing opinions about the same topic (e.g. reviews for a movie, or arguments\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n02 78\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nJ un\n2 01\nfor a controversial social issue), and then outputs a one-sentence abstractive summary that describes the opinion consensus of the input.\nSpecifically, we investigate our abstract generation model on two types of opinionated text: movie reviews and arguments on controversial topics. Examples are displayed in Figure 1. The first example contains a set of professional reviews (or critics) about movie \u201cThe Martian\u201d and an opinion consensus written by an editor. It would be more useful to automatically generate fluent opinion consensus rather than simply extracting features (e.g. plot, music, etc) and opinion phrases as done in previous summarization work (Zhuang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010). The second example lists a set of arguments on \u201cdeath penalty\u201d, where each argument supports the central claim \u201cdeath penalty deters crime\u201d. Arguments, as a special type of opinionated text, contain reasons to persuade or inform people on certain issues. Given a set of arguments on the same topic, we aim at investigating the capability of our abstract generation system for the novel task of claim generation.\nExisting abstract generation systems for opinionated text mostly take an approach that first identifies salient phrases, and then merges them into sentences (Bing et al., 2015; Ganesan et al., 2010). Those systems are not capable of generating new words, and the output summary may suffer from ungrammatical structure. Another line of work requires a large amount of human input to enforce summary quality. For example, Gerani et al. (2014) utilize a set of templates constructed by human, which are filled by extracted phrases to generate grammatical sentences that serve different discourse functions.\nTo address the challenges above, we propose to use an attention-based abstract generation model \u2014 a data-driven approach trained to generate informative, concise, and fluent opinion summaries. Our method is based on the recently proposed framework of neural encoder-decoder models (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014a), which translates a sentence in a source language into a target language. Different from previous work, our summarization system is designed to support multiple input text units. An attention-based model (Bahdanau et al., 2014) is deployed to al-\nlow the encoder to automatically search for salient information within context. Furthermore, we propose an importance-based sampling method so that the encoder can integrate information from an important subset of input text. The importance score of a text unit is estimated from a novel regression model with pairwise preference-based regularizer. With importance-based sampling, our model can be trained within manageable time, and is still able to learn from diversified input.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two newly collected datasets for movie reviews and arguments. Automatic evaluation by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) indicates that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art extract-based and abstractbased methods on both tasks. For example, we achieved a BLEU score of 24.88 on Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews, compared to 19.72 by an abstractive opinion summarization system from Ganesan et al. (2010). ROUGE evaluation (Lin and Hovy, 2003) also indicates that our system summaries have reasonable information coverage. Human judges further rated our summaries to be more informative and grammatical than compared systems."}, {"heading": "2 Data Collection", "text": "We collected two datasets for movie reviews and arguments on controversial topics with goldstandard abstracts.1 Rotten Tomatoes (www. rottentomatoes.com) is a movie review website that aggregates both professional critics and user-generated reviews (henceforth RottenTomatoes). For each movie, a one-sentence critic consensus is constructed by an editor to summarize the opinions in professional critics. We crawled 246,164 critics and their opinion consensus for 3,731 movies (i.e. around 66 reviews per movie on average). We select 2,458 movies for training, 536 movies for validation and 737 movies for testing. The opinion consensus is treated as the gold-standard summary.\nWe also collect an argumentation dataset from idebate.org (henceforth Idebate), which is a Wikipedia-style website for gathering pro and con arguments on controversial issues.

Each point contains a one-sentence central claim constructed by the editors to summarize the corresponding arguments, and is treated as the gold-standard. For instance, on a debate about \u201cdeath penalty\u201d, one claim is \u201cthe death penalty deters crime\u201d with an argument \u201cenacting the death penalty may save lives by reducing the rate of violent crime\u201d (Figure 1). We crawled 676 debates with 2,259 claims.

In general, we utilize a Long Short-Term Memory network for generating abstracts (Section 3.2) from a latent representation computed by an attention-based encoder (Section 3.3). The encoder is designed to search for relevant information from input to better inform the abstract generation process. We also discuss an importance-based sampling method to allow encoder to integrate information from an important subset of input (Sections 3.4 and 3.5). Postprocessing (Section 3.6) is conducted to re-rank the generations and pick the best one as the final summary."}, {"heading": "3.1 Problem Formulation", "text": "In summarization, the goal is to generate a summary y, composed by the sequence of words y1, ..., |y|. Unlike previous neural encoder-decoder approaches which decode from only one input, our input consists of an arbitrary number of reviews or arguments (henceforth text units wherever there is no ambiguity), denoted as x = {x1, ..., xM}. Each text unit xk is composed by a sequence of words xk1, ..., x k |xk|. Each word takes the form of a representation vector, which is initialized randomly or by pre-trained embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013), and updated during training. The summarization task is defined as finding y\u0302, which is the most likely sequence of words y\u03021, ..., y\u0302N such that:\ny\u0302 = argmaxy logP (y|x) (1)\nwhere logP (y|x) denotes the conditional loglikelihood of the output sequence y, given the input text units x. In the next sections, we describe the attention model used to model logP (y|x)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Decoder", "text": "Similar as previous work (Sutskever et al., 2014b; Bahdanau et al., 2014), we decompose logP (y|x) into a sequence of word-level predictions:\nlogP (y|x) = \u2211\nj=1,...,|y|\nlogP (yj |y1, ..., yj\u22121, x) (2)\nwhere each word yj is predicted conditional on the previously generated y1, ..., yj\u22121 and input x. The probability is estimated by standard word softmax:\np(yj |y1, ..., yj\u22121, x) = softmax(hj) (3)\nhj is the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) state variable at timestamp j, which is modeled as:\nhj = g(yj\u22121,hj\u22121, s) (4)\nHere g is a recurrent update function for generating the new state hj from the representation of previously generated word yj\u22121 (obtained from a word lookup table), the previous state hj\u22121, and the input text representation s (see Section 3.3).\nIn this work, we implement g using a Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), which has been shown to be effective at capturing long range dependencies. Here we summarize the update rules for LSTM cells, and refer readers to the original work (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) for more details. Given an arbitrary input vector uj at timestamp j \u2212 1 and the previous state hj\u22121, a typical LSTM defines the following update rules:\nij = \u03c3(Wiuuj +Wihhj\u22121 +Wiccj\u22121 + bi)\nfj = \u03c3(Wfuuj +Wfhhj\u22121 +Wfccj\u22121 + bf )\ncj = fj cj\u22121 + ij tanh(Wcuuj +Wchhj\u22121 + bc) oj = \u03c3(Wouuj +Wohhj\u22121 +Woccj + bo)\nhj = oj tanh(cj) (5)\n\u03c3 is component-wise logistic sigmoid function, and denotes Hadamard product. Projection matrices\nW\u2217\u2217 and biases b\u2217 are parameters to be learned during training.\nLong range dependencies are captured by the cell memory cj , which is updated linearly to avoid the vanishing gradient problem. It is accomplished by predicting two vectors ij and fj , which determine what to keep and what to forget from the current timestamp. Vector oj then decides on what information from the new cell memory cj can be passed to the new state hj . Finally, the model concatenates the representation of previous output word yj\u22121 and the input representation s (see Section 3.3) as uj , which serves as the input at each timestamp."}, {"heading": "3.3 Encoder", "text": "The representation of input text units s is computed using an attention model (Bahdanau et al., 2014). Given a single text unit x1, ..., x|x| and the previous state hj, the model generates s as a weighted sum:\u2211\ni=1,...,|x|\naibi (6)\nwhere ai is the attention coefficient obtained for word xi, and bi is the context dependent representation of xi. In our work, we construct bi by building a bidirectional LSTM over the whole input sequence x1, ..., x|x| and then combining the forward and backward states. Formally, we use the LSTM formulation from Eq. 5 to generate the forward states hf1 , ...,h f |x| by setting uj = xj (the projection word xj using a word lookup table). Likewise, the backward states hb|x|, ...,h b 1 are generated using a backward LSTM by feeding the input in the reverse order, that is, uj = x|x|\u2212j+1.

Given an input of N text units, i.e. {xk1, ..., xk|xk|} N k=1, a simple extension would be to concatenate them into one sequence as z = x11, ..., x 1 |x1|, SEG, x 2 1, ..., x 2 |x2|, SEG, x N 1 , ..., x N |xN |, where SEG is a special token that delimits inputs. However, there are two problems with this approach. Firstly, the model is sensitive to the order of text units. Moreover, z may contain thousands of words. This will become a bottleneck for our model with a training time of O(N |z|), since attention coefficients must be computed for all input words to generate each output word.\nWe address these two problems by sub-sampling from the input. The intuition is that even though the number of input text units is large, many of them are redundant or contain secondary information. As our task is to emphasize the main points made in the input, some of them can be removed without losing too much information. Therefore, we define an importance score f(xk) \u2208 [0, 1] for each document xk (see Section 3.5). During training, K candidates are sampled from a multinomial distribution which is constructed by normalizing f(xk) for input text units. Notice that the training process goes over the training set multiple times, and our model is still able to learn from more than K text units. For testing, top-K candidates with the highest importance scores are collapsed in descending order into z."}, {"heading": "3.5 Importance Estimation", "text": "We now describe the importance estimation model, which outputs importance scores for text units. In general, we start with a ridge regression model, and add a regularizer to enforce the separation of summary-worthy text units from others.\nGiven a cluster of text units {x1, ..., xM} and their summary y, we compute the number of overlapping content words between each text unit and summary y as its gold-standard importance score. The scores are uniformly normalized to [0, 1]. Each text unit xk is represented as an d\u2212dimensional feature vector rk \u2208 Rd, with label lk. Text units in the training data are thus denoted with a feature matrix R\u0303 and a label vector L\u0303. We aim at learning f(xk) = rk \u00b7w by minimizing ||R\u0303w \u2212 L\u0303||22 + \u03b2 \u00b7 ||w||22. This is a standard formulation for ridge regression, and we use fea-\ntures in Table 1. Furthermore, pairwise preference constraints have been utilized for learning ranking models (Joachims, 2002). We then consider adding a pairwise preference-based regularizing constraint to incorporate a bias towards summary-worthy text units: \u03bb \u00b7 \u2211 T \u2211 xp,xq\u2208T ,lp>0,lq=0 ||(rp\u2212 rq) \u00b7w\u22121|| 2 2, where T is a cluster of text units to be summarized. Term (rp \u2212 rq) \u00b7 w enforces the separation of summary-worthy text from the others. We further construct R\u0303\u2032 to contain all the pairwise differences (rp \u2212 rq). L\u0303\u2032 is a vector of the same size as R\u0303\u2032 with each element as 1.

We pre-process the datasets with Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014) for tokenization and extracting POS tags and dependency relations. For RottenTomatoes dataset, we replace movie titles with a generic label in training, and substitute it with the movie name if there is any generic label generated in testing.\nPre-trained Embeddings and Features. The size of word representation is set to 300, both for input and output words. These can be initialized randomly or using pre-trained embeddings learned from Google news (Mikolov et al., 2013). We also extend our model with additional features described in Table 2. Discrete features, such as POS tags, are mapped into word representation via lookup tables. For continuous features (e.g TF-IDF scores), they are attached to word vectors as additional values.\nHyper-parameters and Stop Criterion. The LSTMs (Equation 5) for the decoder and encoders are defined with states and cells of 150 dimensions. The attention of each input word and state pair is computed by being projected into a vector of 100 dimensions (Equation 6).\nTraining is performed via Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011). It terminates when performance does not improve on the development set. We use BLEU (up to 4-grams) (Papineni et al., 2002) as evaluation metric, which computes the precision of n-grams in generated summaries with gold-standard abstracts as the reference. Finally, the importance-based sampling rate (K) is set to 5 for experiments in Sections 5.2 and 5.3.\nDecoding is performed by beam search with a beam size of 20, i.e. we keep 20 most probable output sequences in stack at each step.

Text units are considered relevant if they have at least one overlapping content word with the gold-standard summary. From Figure 2, we can see that our importance estimation model produces uniformly better ranking performance on both datasets."}, {"heading": "5.2 Automatic Summary Evaluation", "text": "For automatic summary evaluation, we consider three popular metrics. ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) is employed to evaluate n-grams recall of the summaries with gold-standard abstracts as reference. ROUGE-SU4 (measures unigram and skipbigrams separated by up to four words) is reported. We also utilize BLEU, a precision-based metric, which has been used to evaluate various language generation systems (Chiang, 2005; Angeli et al., 2010; Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2014). We further consider METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014). As a recall-oriented metric, it calculates similarity between generations and references by considering synonyms and paraphrases.\nFor comparisons, we first compare with an abstractive summarization method presented in Ganesan et al. (2010) on the RottenTomatoes dataset. Ganesan et al. (2010) utilize a graph-based algorithm to remove repetitive information, and merge opinionated expressions based on syntactic struc-\ntures of product reviews.2 For both datasets, we consider two extractive summarization approaches: (1) LEXRANK (Erkan and Radev, 2004) is an unsupervised method that computes text centrality based on PageRank algorithm; (2) Sipos et al. (2012) propose a supervised SUBMODULAR summarization model which is trained with Support Vector Machines. In addition, LONGEST sentence is picked up as a baseline.\nFour variations of our system are tested. One uses randomly initialized word embeddings. The rest of them use pre-trained word embeddings, additional features in Table 2, and their combination. For all systems, we generate a one-sentence summary.\nResults are displayed in Table 3. Our system with pre-trained word embeddings and additional features achieves the best BLEU scores on both datasets (in boldface) with statistical significance (two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.05). Notice that our system summaries are conciser (i.e. shorter on average), which lead to higher scores on precision based-metrics, e.g. BLEU, and lower scores on recall-based metrics, e.g. METEOR and ROUGE. On RottenTomatoes dataset, where summaries generated by different systems are similar in length, our system still outperforms other methods in METEOR and ROUGE in addition to their significantly better BLEU scores. This is not true on Idebate, since the length of summaries by extract-based systems is significantly longer. But the BLEU scores of our system are considerably higher. Among our four systems, models with pre-trained word embeddings in general achieve better scores.

Reviews with the highest gold-standard importance scores were selected.\nResults are reported in Table 4.

This suggests that the current models are oblivious to some task specific issues, such as informativeness. Post-processing is needed to make better use of the summary candidates.

They are often much shorter than the gold-standard human abstracts, thus the information coverage is limited. In other cases, some generations contain incorrect information on domain-dependent facts, e.g. named entities, numbers, etc. For instance, a summary \u201ca poignant coming-of-age tale marked by a breakout lead performance from Cate Shortland\u201d is generated for movie \u201cLore\u201d.

Constructing fluent natural language opinion summaries has mainly considered product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004; Lerman et al., 2009), community question answering (Wang et al., 2014), and editorials (Paul et al., 2010). Extractive summarization approaches are employed to identify summaryworthy sentences. For example, Hu and Liu (2004) first identify the frequent product features and then attach extracted opinion sentences to the corresponding feature. Our model instead utilizes abstract generation techniques to construct natural language summaries. As far as we know, we are also\nthe first to study claim generation for arguments. Recently, there has been a growing interest in generating abstractive summaries for news articles (Bing et al., 2015), spoken meetings (Wang and Cardie, 2013), and product reviews (Ganesan et al., 2010; Di Fabbrizio et al., 2014; Gerani et al., 2014). Most approaches are based on phrase extraction, from which an algorithm concatenates them into sentences (Bing et al., 2015; Ganesan et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the output summaries are not guaranteed to be grammatical. Gerani et al. (2014) then design a set of manually-constructed realization templates for producing grammatical sentences that serve different discourse functions. Our approach does not require any human-annotated rules, and can be applied in various domains.\nOur task is closely related to recent advances in neural machine translation (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014a). Based on the sequence-to-sequence paradigm, RNNs-based models have been investigated for compression (Filippova et al., 2015) and summarization (Filippova et al., 2015; Rush et al., 2015; Hermann et al., 2015) at sentence-level. Built on the attention-based translation model in Bahdanau et al. (2014), Rush et al. (2015) study the problem of constructing abstract for a single sentence. Our task differs from the models presented above in that our model carries out abstractive decoding from multiple sentences instead of a single sentence."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this work, we presented a neural approach to generate abstractive summaries for opinionated text.
