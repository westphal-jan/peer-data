Introduction", "text": "In recent years, the complexity and power of the human brain/mind system has been further revelead by several studies, still an uncountable number of questions regarding mechanisms and functions has not been answered. An increasing number of biologically-inspired studies and publications has apperead in the scientific community spanning from approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) to results of more general interest in Information Technology (IT). It has been widely recognized that emotions play an important role in human life Picard (1997); Arbib and Fellous (2004); Marsella and Gratch (2003). However, traditional AI approaches do not take into account all the dynamics and creative aspects of the mind, therefore demanding for new attacks to the problem of mind modeling.\nThere are several projects which is worth mentioning in the context of emotions and affect simulation in cognitive architectures: Kansei implemented an emotional-oriented approach Nagamachi (2010), emotions are widely taken into account in CogAff by Sloman and Chrisley (2003), and work of Ortony et al. (1990) \u201cOCC\u201d is based on the appraisal theory and the emotion generation. The seminal book for whole domain of the \u201cAffective computing\u201d was created by Picard (1997), and also located in the MIT we can find one of the first and brightest examples of the social robotics: \u201cKismet\u201d by Breazeal (2002).\nOne of the groundbreaking books on emotions and their implementation in a computing system was written by Minsky (2007), where among huge number of ideas he provided the description of the role of the emotions and identified possible computing implementation approaches.\nOn the other hand, the neuropsychological picture of emotions in form of base affects was provided by Lovheim (2012), where emotions are expressed in a three-dimensional model of monoamine neurotransmitters: serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline.\nStill a comprehensive framework bridging the biological affects and computing processes is lacking in the scientific literature. In this paper we attempt to fill the gap providing the bio-inspired approach for the mapping of the biological affects on modern computers with common Von Neumann architecture.\nThe main contribution of this paper is twofold: i) extending the neuropsychological three dimensional model of affects, the Cube of Emotion, with mapping to parameters of von Neumann machine and computing systems;\nii) implementing neuromodulation mechanisms of dopamine in spiking neural network NEST 1 Gewaltig and Diesmann (2007) framework, thus one axis of three dimensional model and indicated the connection of one affect (fear) with computing power load and storage parameters.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: problem description is provided in Section 2, while our emotion-based approach, NEUCOGAR, is presented in Section 3, and detailed analysis is provided in Section 4 with experiment description and results discussion. Section 5 closes the paper with some remarks and conclusions."}, {"heading": "2. The problem", "text": "It has been historically believed that AI systems could have been built upon traditional computing architectures, and that with enough computing power and memory resources, plus some good algorithms, a human-like symbolic intelligence was feasible. It was just a matter of time, money and technology after all. After the initial excitement to this regard (mainly in the 50s of last century) and numerous failures in reaching the desired results, it has been lately hypothesized that this may not be the case. Technically, the neuroendocrine system that provides the mechanisms for brain activity may not be a Turing Machine, though the functioning is not fully understood at the moment. In particular, it is not clear whether higher functions performed by humans, as for example consciousness, are epiphenomena of the brain itself or not.\nDespite of this, and accepting the fact that we may not be able to model the full neuroendocrine system into the Von Neumann architecture, parallels can still be built, and relationships between the two can help in developing new systems for specific purposes. This is the case of Lo\u0308vheim Cube of Emotion where analogies are only built on top of it in relation to dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline brain levels. Simulation of emotions plays a major role in several IT and AI field, not last in the robotics. The ability of a system to feel emotions like, for example, fear, interest or joy can trigger behaviors that were not possible in the era of unemotional machines. Our interest on emotional AI is not the result of basic curiosity, but is grounded on most of evidences that show emotions as main regulators of cognitive processes.\n1http://www.nest-initiative.org/\nThe study of brain disorders, related to emotional management, can also provide ways to understand some complex actions like creativity, concentration or interest. Recently, a new generation of cognitive scientists and roboticists proposed a turnover: on one hand, emotions are a fundamental part of the cognitive processes (attention, motivation, strategy selection, mood disposal, reaction, invention, among a long list); on the other hand, the intrinsic relationship between mind and body led to the birth of embodied cognition or grounded cognition Barsalou (2008). This allowed the emergence of a second and powerful wave of cognitive and robotics experts lead by people like Brooks (1991); Brooks and Stein (1995), DeLancey (2001) (Robotics), Clark (2003) (Philosophy), Damasio (1999), Ramachandran (2004), and Rizzolatti (2004) (Neuroscience).\nIn the middle of this cognitive revolution that led to embodied robotics, enactive cognition or morphological computation ideas, an important discipline emerged as a main reference: neuroscience. Neuroscientists revolutionized the discipline with data coming from in vivo scanned brains (by EEG, fMRI) and brought relevance to the emotional processes into the whole system. As a consequence, some authors, such as Llina\u0301s (2001), attempted explanations on the emergence of consciousness. Therefore, researchers in AI or cognitive sciences started to introduce ideas about emotional processing.\nOnce explained the crucial role of grounded and emotional aspects in cognitive architectures, we assume the Lo\u0308vheim model as a reference for our own architecture. Lovheim (2012) based his theory on a three-dimensional model of emotions and monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline). The vertexes of the model are affects, as defined by the Tomkins theory, which describes eight basic emotions in Kelly (2009). Tomkins labeled with one word for the emotion when it was of low intensity and another word for the same emotion at a higher intensity. Tomkins (1962, 1963, 1991) referred to basic emotions as \u201cinnate affects\u201d, where affect, in his theory, stands for the \u201cstrictly biological portion of emotion\u201d. According to this theory, the eight basic emotions are: enjoyment/joy, interest/excitement, surprise, anger/rage, disgust, distress/anguish, fear/terror and shame/humiliation. Some of them are managed only by the internal processes of the individual, the others are intrinsically related to social interactions."}, {"heading": "3. Our cognitive affective architecture: NEUCOGAR", "text": "In this section we present our novel approach to artificial cognitive architectures, the NEUromodulating COGnitive ARchitecture (NEUCOGAR). The idea is to create a mapping of monoamine neuromodulators to emotional states applied to computing system parameters. Our work starts from the following considerations:\n1. Emotions are natural and necessary modulators, reinforced and modeled at the same time by social external factors or even internal thoughts.\n2. Monoamine neuromodulators are the physical mechanism by which emotional responses are triggered and modulated within cognitive systems like humans, Marsella and Gratch (2003); Marsella et al. (2010).\n3. Several modular models are available: Geneva emotion wheel, Plutchick\u2019s \u201cWheel of emotions\u201d Plutchik (2001), or Cube of Emotion Lovheim (2012), among others. All of them identify different strategies, the basic emotions and how dynamic transitions among them are created Gratch and Marsella (2005).\nStemming from this simple points, our work is focused on modeling the mapping of impacts of monoamine neuromodulators on human brain into the computing processes of modern computers. We propose to correlate biochemical influence of monoamines such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline, involved in affective processing of cortical, limbic and other subsystems of human brain with computing system parameters related to computing power, memory distribution, storage."}, {"heading": "3.1. From real emotions to artificial ones", "text": "The idea behind the mapping of neuromodulators to computing system parameters stands in creating a link between the Von Neumann architecture (abstractly a Turing Machine) and the neuroendocrine system. Our research makes possible to implement a biologically inspired architecture based on neuromodulators. As we will show during the next sections, this innovative approach can provide new ways to automatically manage and devise very important features performed by human beings but still far from computing feasibility. With our research we are not trying to propose a new version of a cognitive architecture that attaches an emotional module Lin (2011) or Breazeal (2004). Our aim is radically different, Vallverdu\u0301 (2012): building\nan emotional structure that is at the same time the cognitive structure. As just in human beings and most of living entities.\nAs the human brain as a whole reacts to changes in the neuromodulator and hormonal levels, the model presented in this paper offers a ground for simulations of emotions in the Von Neumann architecture (with the clear understanding that, most likely, not every brain function can be reproduced in the same way). This mapping is clearly not sufficient: proper algorithms need to be developed to reproduce higher functions on top of the \u201chormonal reactive machinery\u201d. These algorithms will monitor CPU activity and memory allocation in order to track (simulated) hormonal and neuromodulators levels and react accordingly.\nHigher functions of the brain like consciousness and proactivity (the ability of not reacting in the short term to immediate physiological responses) may possibly be simulated on top of basic functions. However, this still remains an unproven hypothesis needing accurate investigation. If such higher functions are indeed epiphenomena of the brain (or endocrine systems) is still under debate in several scientific communities.\nAccording to their nature we can split computing system parameters in three groups: processing, memory and storage. More specifically, the parameters taken into account are:\nComputing utilization is a metric able to quantify how busy the processing resources of the system are. It can be expressed by the average value of all the single processing resources\u2019 utilization.\nComputing distribution aims at quantifying the load balancing among processing resources. It can be expressed as the variance of single resources\u2019 utilization.\nMemory distribution is associated with the amount of memory allocated to the processing resources. It can be quantified by the variance of the amount of memory per single resource.\nStorage volume is an index related to the the amount of data and information used by the system.\nStorage bandwidth quantifies the number of connections between resources, i.e. processing and data nodes."}, {"heading": "3.2. NEUCOGAR in details", "text": "In Fig. 1 a revised version of the Cube of Emotion model is depicted as originally introduced in Lovheim (2012). The information on the cube is adapted to the computing domain and extended to include parameters related to computing power, memory and storage. It represents the link bridging neuroscience and psychology with concepts of computing and AI systems. This paper aims at building a common understanding between these three worlds and possibly fostering a productive cooperation among specialists of all these fields.\nLow level influence of affects on brain (cellular or neuronal) provides fundamental base for our affective computation model. We draw an analogy between computing processes in computer and neurotransmission in brain, simulating biochemical influence of neuromodulatory systems on neurons and translating them into the computing processes of a machine. Especially interesting from our perspective is Arbib and Fellous (2004), where the role of dopamine, serotonin and their impact in emotional context (of mammalian brains) is discussed. It can be considered as one of the basis for our work in the simulation of neuromodulation domain. Our interest for these 3 neurotransmitters is based on the fact that they are the three main chemical\nsubstances managing brain\u2019s inhibitory and excitation processes that drive and run cognition, attention, and perception. Furthermore, serotonin and noradrenaline strongly influence mental behavior patterns, while dopamine is involved in movement. For this reason they are the focus of neuroscientific studies for many years Blows (2000).\nMore specifically: Dopamine appears to play a major role in motor activation, appetitive motivation, reward processing and neuronal plasticity, and therefore might be important in emotion. According to Lo\u0308vheim Cube of Emotion, dopamine is associated with \u201creward, reinforcement, motivation\u201d. In the computational interpretation presented in this work, dopamine plays a rewarding role in computing utilization and storage volume, i.e. increased overall processor activity and amount of memorized data.\n\u201cSerotonin\u201d - Lo\u0308vheim says - has been implicated in behavioral state regulation and arousal, motor pattern generation, sleep, learning and plasticity, food intake, mood and social behavior\u201d Lovheim (2012). Serotonin plays a crucial role in the modulation of aggression and in agonistic social interactions in many animals. Lo\u0308vheim associates serotonin with \u201cself, confidence, inner strength, and satisfaction\u201d.\nThe computational interpretation of the Lo\u0308vheim Cube of Emotion places serotonin as influencer of computing utilization and storage bandwith, i.e. increased overall processor activity (sinergically with dopamine) and rise of connectivity between nodes.\nFinally, Lo\u0308vheim Cube of Emotion emphasizes the noradrenaline role in: \u201cAttention, vigilance, activity\u201d. Then, it describes the role of noradrenaline: \u201c... noradrenaline has been coupled to the fight or flight response and to stress and anxiety, and appears to represent an axis of activation, vigilance and attention\u201d. In the computational interpretation, noradrenaline mainly influences computing and memory distribution, since it allows to promptly react to some specific conditions and/or alerts, changing the configuration of the system at runtime, and therefore impacting on processing and memory configuration.\nA holistic view of the diagram shows that:\nComputing utilization is influenced by dopamine and serotonin, which increase the firing spike activity of cortex neurons and therefore increase usage of the \u201cartificial\u201d brain of the computing system.\nComputing distribution is influenced by noradrenaline. The higher the\nlevel of noradrenaline, the more computing power has to be concentrated on the current activity (neuromodulator regulating attention).\nMemory distribution (short term memory/focus) is impacted by noradrenaline, which is moudulator of attention.\nStorage volume (long term memory) is impacted by both serotonin and dopamine, i.e. higher concentrations of both neuromodulators makes system more efficient in remembering a stimulus. In general, strong emotions generate more persistent memories and involve bigger amound of data.\nStorage bandwith is influenced by serotonin, i.e. higher concentrations of the neuromodulator increases the connectivity, i.e. the number of connections between nodes."}, {"heading": "4. Validation", "text": "To the purpose of validating our approach, we have implemented the dopamine neuromodulation of the fear affect in the computing system and check one axis of our model. In this section we report on preliminary experiments we performed. Specifically, in Section 4.1 we describe the setup of the experiment, while in Section 4.2 we present the obtained results."}, {"heading": "4.1. Experiment description", "text": "The experiment looks for the validation of dopamine neuromodulation and its influence on a cerebral cortex and therefore thinking processes. We made the general assumption that thinking processes are analogous to or could be expressed as computing processes. We have implemented a nigrostriatal dopamine pathway published by Albin et al. (1989) with some extensions for feed-back loops and additional connections according to modern findings in neuroscience as shown in Fig. 2. The dopamine neuromodulation is modulated by an area of the brain called substantia nigra compacta (SNc) that produces dopamine and projects it to another brain area named striatum for balancing between pathways. The mammalian striatum consists of neurons with different dopamine receptors: D1 and D2 balancing direct and indirect pathways (depicted below in Fig. 2) through their heterogeneous sensitivity to dopamine neurotransmitter.\nThe direct pathway is Cerebral cortex (stimulate) \u2192 Striatum (inhibit) \u2192 complex SNr-GPi (Thalamus is less inhibited) \u2192 Thalamus (stimulate) \u2192 Cerebral cortex (stimulate) \u2192 muscles and etc.\nThe indirect pathway is Cerebral cortex (stimulate)\u2192 Striatum (inhibit) \u2192 GPe (STN is less inhibited)\u2192 STN (stimulate)\u2192 complex SNr-GPi (inhibit)\u2192 Thalamus (is less stimulated)\u2192 Cerebral cortex (is less stimulated) \u2192 muscles and etc."}, {"heading": "4.2. Results", "text": "In our simulation through the spiking neural network tool NEST, we aimed at demonstrating these mechanisms, with specific focus on dopamine neuromodulation. In particular, during the experiments, we observed the spiking activities of thalamus and cerebral motor cortex reacting to these neromodulation. We therefore created a spiking network model of the overall nigrostriatal pathway simulating its behaviour in the [0,1000]ms simulation time frame. At 400ms we triggered a volume transmission of dopamine in substancia nigra and observed the effects in both thalamus and cerebral motor cortex.\nFig. 3 describes the reaction of the thalamus. It shows the increasing spiking activities right after the input from substancia nigra, highlighting a growing activity on computing power, increasing its utilization. As a side effect, this enhanced the synapses among neurons thus enforcing and increasing data persistence in storage.\nWith regard to the cerebral motor cortex, Fig. 4 reports its activity. As for thalamus, from this plot we can easily identify a reaction to the input at time 400ms due to the interaction with thalamus. The raster plot also shows the noise activity typical of mammalian cerebral cortex.\nThe above results concur to demonstrate the correctness of our approach based on the hypotheses and on the model discussed in Section 3 along to only one axis of the Cube of Emotion associated with dopamine."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions and future work", "text": "The mind/body management is related to emotional signals that capture, process and classify data inputs and allow responses. We propose the neurobiologically inspired cognitive architecture for the simulation of affects in a computing system. Our approach is innovative for several reasons:\n\u2022 We need not running a whole brain simulation in order to achieve a\nfunctional artificial cognitive system, and this allow us to avoid the still existing and deep uncertainties between brain structure and performance (at this historical moment, brain researchers are at the same point that genetic biologists starting to decode the genome: with a lot of information, in fact too much, but without meaning).\n\u2022 We are not qualitatively imitating the surface of the emotional mechanism of human brains and bodies, instead we are suggesting a new approach that is rooted in the neuromodulation, the key piece of brain emotional and cognitive processes. It is out of any doubt that basic as well as high cognitive performance skills are related to emotional management, which makes possible innovative, creative and fresh ways to deal with multihaptic and raw data. Emotional architectutre for AI is not the result of interests on HRo or some human psychological processes, but the real necessity of creating better autonomous systems. Data mining and deep learning are providing new connections between data, but not new wways to deal with data, something that we expect that emotional architectures will be able to perform.\n\u2022 This functional approach allows generation of more dynamic systems that add cognitive power beyond the basics of classic weights, thresholds or valences, providing options to build a cognitive architecture that generates several faces of emotional interactions such as moods, attitudes, emotional memories or affective states.\n\u2022 This approach makes possible to implement computingly a more subtle training mechanism of artificial cognitive architectures. Here, the syntax is dynamic but at the same time hardwired into the basic objects. Artificial neurotrasmitters not only flavour emotionally all objects present into the program, but also makes possible more complex interactions. Thus, it open the door towards the integration of multiheuristic approaches under the same architecture, in the same way that operate human beings (using several formal heuristics, abductive, deductive, inductive thinking,...): we will be able to implement a system that follows several reasoning rules but that at that time, these rules will be affected by the distribution, concentration and influence of synthetic neurotransmitters.\nThe NEUCOGAR provides the proper background to the implementation of emotional elements into the whole system, acting as the basic piece\nof regulation, and not as an attached module with emotional contents. This architecture allows to apply it smoothly from scratch (the artificial neuron or unit of processing) to the superior layers of specialized cognitive processes (like memories, processors). In this sense, NEUCOGAR is a whole artificial cognitive system that simulates the basic running of bodily emotional systems, following a modular architecture that is put together and ruled by the same emotional cyber-neuromodulators.\nThe validation of the NEUCOGAR is complex task that involves use of spiking neural network NEST2 Gewaltig and Diesmann (2007) and creation of proper brain cortical and subcortical areas and connections. We have managed to validate only one axis of the NEUCOGAR model, the dopamine axis, because it has been better explored than others at the moment. This validation indicated principal correctness of the approach to simulate emotions in the form of inborn affects in a computing system. In the experiments it has been noted the rise of computing power and of storage redistribution due to emotion stimulus modulated by dopamine system. This demonstrated the soundness of the proposed approach on one axis of the Cube of Emotion model.\nWe consider adding serotonin pathways as the most important extension of current implementation. That will allow validation of up to 4 affects: joy, fear, disgust, humiliation, and overall will make the model from onedimensional to bi-dimensional. Further enhancement with noradrenaline will provide the 8 basic affects that could be used as the base for the implementation of the infant emotional cognitive architecture as well as be helpful for the emotion recognition, evaluation and measurement.\nSummary - We can summarize NEUCOGAR achievements as follows:\n\u2022 It provides the first computational bottom up or grounded emotional architecture, which integrates fundamental emotional mechanisms into artificial cognitive systems. In this model, hormonal mechanisms permeates the totality of the system, instead of being one of the modules under interaction, as usual.\n\u2022 It is a bio-inspired architecture, based on neurotransmitters, that makes possible to implement human-like cognitive processes into Von Neumann\u2019s architectures.\n2http://www.nest-initiative.org/\n\u2022 The neurotrasmitters provide the system with a unique, flexible, valuable and tunable affective model.\n\u2022 The validation of NEUCOGAR showed its reliability and efficiency at modular level.\n\u2022 NEUCOGAR helps us to understand at a scalable level the mechanisms of proactivity, attention, processing, concentration, storage and reaction, among other cognitive processes. It is the functional and best reverse approach for the naturalization and functional improvement of AI.\n\u2022 NEUCOGAR allows to start to think about the mechanisms that act during the switch between multiheuristic strategies within cognitive systems (as individuals as well as a social collectives)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Partial support for this research was received by the Spanish Government\u2019s DGICYT research project: FFI2011-23238, \u201cInnovation in scientific practice: cognitive approaches and their philosophical consequences\u201d and by the Russian Ministry of education and science (agreement: 14.612.21.0001, ID: RFMEFI61214X0001)."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "In this paper we present a new neurobiologically-inspired affective cognitive architecture: NEUCOGAR (NEUromodulating COGnitive ARchitecture).
