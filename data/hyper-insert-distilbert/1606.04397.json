Firstly, because intuitively graphical procedures often appear simpler than their formal counterparts, and secondly, because even highly accomplished theoreticians emphasize the usefulness of graphics for getting insight into suitable problem-solving approaches [5]. Therefore it appears inappropriate to some researchers to analyse graphic information processing by means of an informationally but not structurally equivalent formal representation.\nWhile debates about the complexity of graphic information processing focused on the use of static spatial information in graphics, the strong spatial cognition (SSC) paradigm goes one step further and addresses spatial transformation of spatial configurations for problem solving, i.e. replacing computational operations by physical operations.\nSuch problems have in common that parts of the problem are real world objects, instead of representations within a computer. In [2] such an example is discussed: a map, where parts of the reality, e.g. streets or places are represented by real world objects, namely drawings consisting of lines and polygons on paper. Such a representation is called a weak or mild abstraction i.e. an abstraction where properties of objects and relations, which are relevant for solving certain problems are preserved. In [3] the notion of intrinsic properties of parts of a representation was used to describe a similar effect. In the map example these are the relative length and orientation of streets and the size of a place. This can be used to solve problems like localization or path finding. An alternative to a map on paper would be an abstraction of the real world, where routes ar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n04 39\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 4\nJu n\n20 16\nare represented by strings and locations by connections between the strings. An example is depicted in Figure 1a, which we will use later on in order to analyse a path finding problem.\nAnother famous example for using mild abstractions for solving real world problems is the hanging chain method used to model catenary curves. This is used e.g. by the Catalan architect Gaudi for the construction of organic designs of churches, like the Sagrada Familia. Gaudi used weighted strings to determine the optimal static design of arcs in his architecture, instead of computing the curves, whose math was well known at this time (due to work of Leibniz, Huygens and Bernoulli on these catenary curves). This techniques is used in modern architecture as well. As an example the \u2019Multihalle Mannheim\u2019 together with its chain model is shown in Figure 2\nIn spatial cognition research there is increasing work, which aims at developing models that take into account the role of the body and the spatial environment. The interaction between mind, body, and environment helps to find solutions to spatial problems. As an example, we will analyse in this paper a shortest path solution which is based on the mild abstraction as given in\nFigure 1, this is called the SSCSP -Problem (Strong Spatial Cognition Shortest Path) in the following.\nThe next section introduces the SSCSP-Solution; in order to analyse this problem solving method we will simplify it and transform it in a subsequent section to a symbolic algorithm, the structured SSCSP-Solution, which will be be analysed and compared with graph algorithms. Since symbolic algorithms usually are analysed by complexity considerations, we will try to apply a complexity measure to the structured SSCSP-Solution as well.\n2 SSCSP in a Physical World\nWe will now use strings as a mild abstraction as illustrated in Figure 1. Here, we use strings to represent routes between two locations. The intersections of those strings represent the intersections in a route network. The length of the strings are given by a fixed scaling factor of the corresponding routes. So the relative lengths of the routes are preserved. The task is is to find the shortest path between two locations A and B within a route network. This is the SSCSP - Problem. We now use this string representation in order to solve it. The locations A and B have representations A\u2032 and B\u2032 in the string model. In order to find the shortest path between A and B one simply has to pull apart strings at A\u2032 and B\u2032 \u2014 voila\u0300. It is immediately clear that the shortest route is given by those strings that are pulled straight and the length of the shortest path is represented by the distance between A\u2032 and B\u2032. This is the SSCSP-Solution. Interestingly, we managed to solve the problem without analysing the network in any way, all we had to do was to pull.\nThe complexity seems to be constant \u2014 you need one operation \u2019pulling apart\u2019. In contrast, if we represent the network by a graph using a data structure in a computer, we know that the complexity of the problem is exponential in the number of nodes on the path.\nIt is astonishing how humans manage to solve the shortest path problem immediately by just pulling the strings. And even more: they are convinced that\nthis yields a shortest path \u2014 this property is just \u2019popping up\u2019. This motivates us to analyze this solution within the mild abstraction paradigm in more detail, putting special emphasis on the complexity aspect.\nIn computer science we focus on information and we are interested in the complexity of algorithms wrt. information processing effort required in terms of processing steps and storage capacity. We do not take into account mass and energy when we discuss complexity of information processing. But how can we assess the complexity of problem-solving processes appropriately when we manipulate information by other means than in classical telecommunication or computer architectures, where bits of information are propagated through static or ad hoc networks? To our knowledge, there is no specific theory for information processing complexity of graphic information processing such as in depictive geometry, scientific graphs, or geographic maps where some of the operations may consist of manipulating physical and spatial entities.\nWe are interested in the question of whether the complexity of solving a problem is inherent only in the problem and its information-theoretical representation and processing structures or whether it also can be a function of the physical and spatial substrate in which the problem is manifested.\nIn the following section we will transform the structured SSCSP-Solution into a graph-based algorithm, namely breath-first search \u2014 a common approach in symbolic problem solving. Furthermore, we propose an approach for comparing complexities of both methods. We will see that both methods, the structured SSCSP-Solution and the graph-search have a very similar structure \u2014 the astonishing effect is that one needs not to be aware of this structure, when the problem is solved using the mild abstraction. Once the problem is transformed into a symbolic graph-based representation, one needs to know about algorithms for graph-search to solve the problem.\n3 From SSCSP to a symbolic algorithm\nWe start by analysing a simplified version of the problem: We assume that all strings connecting nodes have the same length d. Furthermore, we will only pull on node A\u2032 instead of both, A\u2032 and B\u2032. Now, we observe the pull operation and notice that the closer a node is to A\u2032, the earlier it starts to move.\nIn order to get this more precisely, we change our model. We assume the network is spread on a flat surface. Instead of pulling nodes apart, we assume an operation grab, which selects only one node and the pulling apart is changed into a lift of the grabbed node vertically into the third dimension until B\u2032 is lifted from the surface as well. Once B\u2032 is lifted, the shortest path is given by the sequence of strings by which B\u2032 hangs from A\u2032. Now, we can decompose the lift into single steps, where we only pull up until a new node is lifted from the surface (this is depicted in Figure 3). With respect to the work needed to lift nodes we see easily that lifting the nodes into the third dimension certainly can be seen as an upper bound compared to the work necessary to pull the nodes\napart in two dimensions. This enables us to describe our solution to shortest path in a more detailed way than before.\nThe structured SSCSP-Solution is given by:\n\u2013 grab node A\u2032 \u2013 repeat until node B\u2032 is lifted: increase height of A\u2032 over surface by distance d\nNote that, if a node x is lifted from the surface, the next lifting operation causes all adjacent nodes of x still on the surface to be lifted together. This is another simplification of our model; depending on the structure of the network it may happen that during one lift-operation an adjacent node is lifted earlier than its neighbors. This may occur e.g. if one node has no adjacent node, while its neighbor is connected to larger part of the network. The connecting string to the latter will form a kind of hanging chain curve, because of the friction of the part of network, which is still on the surface. This node is lifted after a distance smaller than d, whereas the other node, the one without a further connection, will be lifted only at the end of the lift operation by distance d. This effect is ignored in the following \u2013 we simply assume that there is no friction between nodes and the surface. Thus work is only necessary for lifting nodes.\nWith these assumptions, we can construct a formal method of solving the shortest path problem for uniform edge length in a theoretical representation as an undirected graph. We represent the lifting of nodes simply by adding nodes to a set lift\u2014 in one lift operation all adjacent nodes of a node are lifted at the same time. This corresponds to the insertion of all adjacent nodes in one step into the set lift . The nodes in the set lift correspond to those nodes which are lifted above the surface.\nAs graph search we have the following algorithm:\n\u2013 lift = {A\u2032} \u2013 repeat until node B\u2032 \u2208 lift\nfor each element in lift add all its adjacent nodes to lift\nThis is actually a breadth first search algorithm (BFS )[4]. The distance between A and B is given by the number of loop iterations required and the shortest path can simply be derived with backtracking. In order to keep it simple, we have not included this in our description. This version of BFS appears to be rather naive: it does not include a marking of nodes which already have been expanded \u2014 there is an \u2019attempt\u2019 for every node to add its adjacent nodes into lift even if this has been done already in previous steps."}, {"heading": "4 Comparing both Approaches", "text": "Despite the apparent similarity of both approaches, the time complexities are rather different. The time of the structured SSCSP-Solution is linear in the distance between A\u2032 and B\u2032 and the time of BFS depends on the structure of the graph. Comparing the two approaches shows immediately that in iteration i of the structured SSCSP-Solution all nodes that are i nodes or less away from A\u2032 are lifted by d. They are all lifted simultaneously. Whereas in BFS in iteration i all nodes distance i or less are added to lift . The run-time of this depends on the implementation and the architecture available. The structured SSCSP-Solution can be seen as a kind of parallel version of BFS. However, if there are sufficiently many parallel processes available and with the appropriate implementation, BFS can have a similar run-time.\nTime complexity of graph algorithms usually is measured by counting the number of nodes which have to be visited during search. Instead of counting nodes, we base our complexity analysis on the physical work necessary to perform the lift operation of nodes. For the complexity of the structured SSCSP-Solution we now assume all nodes have a weight w and the strings are weightless. It requires a work of w \u00b7 d to lift a node. For simplification, let us assume that the grab operation requires also work w \u00b7 d. Let l(i) be the number of nodes with distance (i.e. number of nodes on shortest path) i from A\u2032. Let the n be the distance from A to B. A node with distance i from A\u2032 is lifted (n\u2212 i+ 1) times. The work required by the structured SSCSP-Solution is\nw \u00b7 d \u00b7 n\u2211\ni=0\n(n\u2212 i + 1) \u00b7 l(i). (1)\nFor the complexity of BFS we now assume that adding nodes requires a time t for each node in the resulting set lift . For simplification, let us assume that the initialization of lift requires time t. The time required by BFS is\nt \u00b7 n\u2211\ni=0\n(n\u2212 i + 1) \u00b7 l(i). (2)\nComparing Equations 1 and 2 shows immediately that the work of SSCSP directly corresponds to the running time of BFS.\nHowever, in common implementations of BFS, the run-time is not only dependent on how many nodes are added. Rather, we pick each node x in lift and then add all its adjacent nodes consecutively. This often results in nodes being added multiple times in a single iteration. Assume now that each such node addition requires time t. Let N(i) be the set of nodes that have distance i to A\u2032. Let g(x) be the out\u2013degree of a node x. Now, the time required by BFS is\nt \u00b7 n\u22121\u2211 i=0 (n\u2212 i) \u00b7 \u2211 x\u2208N(i) g(x)  . (3) This complexity also transfers to the structured SSCSP-Solution if we assume that each string has a weight w and the nodes are weightless. Since the nodes are weightless the grab operation requires no work and lifting a node x by d requires work g(x) \u00b7w.4 The work required by the structured SSCSP-Solution is\nw \u00b7 d \u00b7 n\u22121\u2211 i=0 (n\u2212 i) \u00b7 \u2211 x\u2208N(i) g(x)  . (4) The BFS is usually accelerated. In each iteration, it is enough to add only nodes adjacent to nodes newly added in the previous iteration. Here, we could show that the complexity is similar to the SSCSP -Solution if we assume that only lifting a string off the surface requires work. This, however, seems to be an unrealistic assumption; the previously lifted nodes have to be also lifted, which of course, needs more work. This is an example for an optimization of BFS which does not carry over to SSCSP.\nIf we do not require uniform string length between nodes, the parallels become less clear. The most prominent approach here is Dijkstra\u2019s shortest path algorithm[1] which processes the nodes and edges in the order of their distance to the starting node. This is similar to the SSCSP -Solution. However, there does not seem to be a direct correspondence between the run-time of an execution of Dijkstra and the SSCSP -Solution.\nWe would like to emphasize again, that the complexity consideration in Equation 4 was done mainly to analyse the structure of the SSCSP -Solution and to compare it with the symbolic BFS. We are aware, that the representation of a problem by using mild abstractions allows very well an adaption of the physical objects to the power available for the solution. E.g. in the SSCSP -Problem from Figure 1 the entire layout of the graph and the lenghth of the strings is such, that we can do the pulling apart very easily - without beeing aware of the \u2019work-complexity\u2019 defined above.\n4 The work to lift a string from the surface is obviously smaller than g(x) \u00b7w, because the string which corresponds to an edge is not lifted at once in entirety. Moreover, this is done in a continuous way resulting in less work. Hence, Equation 4 is an over estimation."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this note we presented and analyzed a shortest path procedure using strong spatial cognition. We compared the approach with a symbolic graph search algorithm by estimating the amount of physical work required to construct a shortest path. We arrived at the conclusion that structure and complexity of both approaches can easily be mapped to one another. This is surprising as the solution of the problem when presented with mild abstraction, i.e. by employing physical objects, pops up immediately; we do not become aware of the internal structure and the physical complexity of the approach. In comparison, the symbolic graph-based algorithm can be designed and applied only with knowledge about data and graphs available.\nWhat is the reason for our perception of different complexity of the symbolic vs. the physical problem solving approach to the shortest path problem? In the symbolic approach, we compose algorithms from structurally simple elements, using knowledge about the length of path segments and explicitly combining these elements to essentially building up the network of paths, keeping track of those parts of the network that promise to yield the shortest overall path. In comparison, in the SSC approach we do not deal with components; we do not even have to know any length to identify a shortest path. The approach exploits intrinsic spatial relations that are implicit in the network of strings and cannot be violated. For this reason it will be difficult to program the approach incorrectly. Physical affordances and constraints do the work for us and we do not have to understand how the strings and nodes move for the approach to yield a correct result."}], "references": [{"title": "A note on two problems in connexion with graphs", "author": ["E.W.
