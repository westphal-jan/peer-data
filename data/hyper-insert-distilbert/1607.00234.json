They are totally different from other sets/logics/probabilities/statistics.\nWe extended the neutrosophic set respectively to Neutrosophic Overset {when some neutrosophic component is > 1}, Neutrosophic Underset {when some neutrosophic component is < 0}, and to Neutrosophic Offset {when some neutrosophic components are off the interval [0, 1], i.e. some neutrosophic component > 1 and other neutrosophic component < 0}.\nThis is no surprise with respect to the classical fuzzy set/ logic, intuitionistic fuzzy set/ logic, or classical/ imprecise probability, where the values are not allowed outside the interval [0, 1], since our real-world has numerous examples and applications of over-/under-/off-neutrosophic components.\nFlorentin Smarandache\n12"}, {"heading": "Example:", "text": "In a given company a full-time employer works 40\nhours per week. Let\u2019s consider the last week period.\nHelen worked part-time, only 30 hours, and the other 10 hours she was absent without payment; hence, her membership degree was 30/40 = 0.75 < 1.\nJohn worked full-time, 40 hours, so he had the membership degree 40/40 = 1, with respect to this company.\nBut George worked overtime 5 hours, so his membership degree was (40+5)/40 = 45/40 = 1.125 > 1. Thus, we need to make distinction between employees who work overtime, and those who work full-time or parttime. That\u2019s why we need to associate a degree of membership strictly greater than 1 to the overtime workers.\nNow, another employee, Jane, was absent without pay for the whole week, so her degree of membership was 0/40 = 0.\nYet, Richard, who was also hired as a full-time, not only didn\u2019t come to work last week at all (0 worked hours), but he produced, by accidentally starting a devastating fire, much damage to the company, which was estimated at a value half of his salary (i.e. as he would have gotten for working 20 hours that week). Therefore, his membership degree has to be less that Jane\u2019s (since Jane produced no damage). Whence, Richard\u2019s degree of membership, with respect to this company, was - 20/40 = - 0.50 < 0. Thus, we need to make distinction between employees who produce damage, and those who produce profit, or produce neither damage no profit to the company.\nNeutrosophic Overset, Neutrosophic Underset, and Neutrosophic Offset Similarly for Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off- Logic, Probability, and Statistics\n13\nTherefore, the membership degrees > 1 and < 0 are real\nin our world, so we have to take them into consideration.\nThen, similarly, the Neutrosophic Logic / Measure / Probability / Statistics etc. were extended to respectively Neutrosophic Over- / Under- / Off -Logic, -Measure, - Probability, -Statistics etc. [Smarandache, 2007].\nMany practical obvious examples are presented in this book, in order to show that in our everyday life we continuously deal with neutrosophic over-/under-/offtheory and applications.\nFlorentin Smarandache\n14\nFeedback from the readers about this very new neutrosophic over- / under- / off- (\u2013set, \u2013logic, \u2013measure, \u2013 probability, \u2013statistics) and their applications is very welcomed by the author.\nProf. Florentin Smarandache, Ph D University of New Mexico Mathematics & Science Department 705 Gurley Ave., Gallup, NM 87301, USA E-mail: smarand@unm.edu http://fs.gallup.unm.edu/FlorentinSmarandache.htm\nNeutrosophic Overset, Neutrosophic Underset, and Neutrosophic Offset Similarly for Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off- Logic, Probability, and Statistics\n15"}, {"heading": "New Neutrosophic Terminology", "text": "We introduce several new scientific notions in the domain of Neutrosophic Theory and Its Applications, coined now for the first time upon the best of our knowledge, created by juxtaposition of two words, i.e.\na) inserting the prefix \u201cover\u201d, \u201cunder\u201d, or \u201coff\u201d b) in front of a noun, such as:\n- \u201cmembership\u201d, \u201cindeterminate-membership\u201d,\n\u201cnonmembership\u201d;\n- or \u201ctruth\u201d, \u201cindeterminacy\u201d, \u201cfalsehood\u201d;

Therefore, his/her membership was 1 or T(student) = 1.\nBut there were students enrolled in six classes as well (overloaded). Then a twinkle sparked in my mind: I thought it was normal to consider such student\u2019s membership degree greater than 1, or T(overload student) = 6\n5 = 1.2 > 1.\nSurely, this was in contradiction with the orthodoxy that the crisp membership degree of an element with respect to a set has to be \u2264 1.\nI dug more into the problem and looked for other examples and applications from our everyday life. I did not want to stick with the abstractness of the mathematics, but to be inspired from our concrete reality.\nI was even more shocked when I discovered examples of membership degree < 0 of an element with respect to a set.\nFor example, let\u2019s consider the set of spy agents of a\ncountry against an enemy country.\nA full-time spy, working only for his country, has the degree of membership equals to 1 with respect to the set of spy agents in his country. He is productive.\nBut a double-agent, that leaks highly classified information to the enemy country, while to his country he provides false information about the enemy country,\nFlorentin Smarandache\n20\nproduces much damage to his country (he is counterproductive), hence he has a negative membership degree with respect to the set of spy agents of his country, since he actually belongs to the set of spy agents of the enemy country, thus T(double-agent) < 0.

We also considered the case when an electronic device was not finished at the end of the week, so only a part of it done. Otherwise we\u2019d take a discrete set.\nTherefore, the minimum underlimit is \u2264 \u221240, i.e. in the\nsituation when a worker produces wrong electronic devices, but the damage can be done even at a higher proportion (destroying tools, etc.).\nIn the history of the company, the worst damage has been done two years ago by Jack (-45) who has produced defected electronic devices and destroyed several tools.\nThe maximum overlimit is > 20, for employees working\nfaster, or doing overtime.\nOne studies record in the history of the company.

Paradoxist Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and\nComputer Sciences, Bloomsburg University, PA, USA, November 13, 1995, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\nNeutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off-Set and -Logic were defined for the first time by Smarandache in 1995 and published in 2007. They are totally different from other sets/logics/probabilities.\nHe extended the neutrosophic set respectively to Neutrosophic Overset {when some neutrosophic component is > 1}, Neutrosophic Underset {when some neutrosophic component is < 0}, and to Neutrosophic Offset {when some neutrosophic components are off the interval [0, 1], i.e. some neutrosophic component > 1 and other neutrosophic component < 0}.\nThis is no surprise with respect to the classical fuzzy set/logic, intuitionistic fuzzy set/logic, or classical/imprecise probability, where the values are not allowed outside the interval [0, 1], since our real-world has numerous examples and applications of over-/under-/off-neutrosophic components.\nExample of Neutrosophic Offset. In a given company a full-time employer works 40 hours per week. Let\u2019s consider the last week period. Helen worked part-time, only 30 hours, and the other 10 hours she was absent without payment; hence, her membership degree was 30/40 = 0.75 < 1. John worked full-time, 40 hours, so he had the membership degree 40/40 = 1, with respect to this company. But George worked overtime 5 hours, so his membership degree was (40+5)/40 = 45/40 = 1.125 > 1. Thus, we need to make distinction between employees who work overtime, and those who work full-time or part-time. That\u2019s why we need to associate a degree of membership strictly greater than 1 to the overtime workers.\nNow, another employee, Jane, was absent without pay for the whole week, so her degree of membership was 0/40 = 0.\nYet, Richard, who was also hired as a full-time, not only didn\u2019t come to work last week at all (0 worked hours), but he produced, by accidentally starting a devastating fire, much damage to the company, which was estimated at a value half of his salary (i.e. as he would have gotten for working 20 hours that week). Therefore, his membership degree has to be less that Jane\u2019s (since Jane produced no damage). Whence, Richard\u2019s degree of membership, with respect to this company, was - 20/40 = - 0.50 < 0.\nConsequently, we need to make distinction between employees who produce damage, and those who produce profit, or produce neither damage no profit to the company.\nTherefore, the membership degrees > 1 and < 0 are real in our world, so we have to take them into consideration.\nThen, similarly, the Neutrosophic Logic/Measure/Probability/Statistics etc. were extended to respectively Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off-Logic, -Measure, -Probability, -Statistics etc. [Smarandache, 2007]."}], "references": [{"title": "Unifying Field in Logics: Neutrosophic Logic.
