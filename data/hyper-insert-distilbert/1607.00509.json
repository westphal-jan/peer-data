Therefore, most cities have undertaken significant investments during the last decade in ICT infrastructure including computers, broadband connectivity and recently sensing infrastructures. These infrastructures have empowered a number of innovative services in areas such as participatory sensing, urban logistics and ambient assisted living. Such services have been extensively deployed in several cities, thereby demonstrating the potential benefits of ICT infrastructures for businesses and the citizens themselves. During the last few years we have also witnessed an explosion of sensor deployments and social networking services, along with the emergence of social networking (Conti et al., 2011) and internet\u2010of\u2010things technologies (Perera et al., 2013; Sundmaeker et al., 2010) Social and sensor\nnetworks can be combined in order to offer a variety of added\u2010value services for smart cities, as has already been demonstrated by various early internet\u2010 of\u2010things applications (such as WikiCity(Calabrese et al., 2007), CitySense(Murty et al., 2007), GoogleLatitude(Page and Kobsa, 2010)), as well as applications combining social and sensor networks (as for example provided by (Breslin and Decker, 2007; Breslin et al., 2009) and (Miluzzo et al., 2007). Recently, the benefits of social networking and internet\u2010of\u2010things deployments for smart cities have also been demonstrated in the context of a range of EC co\u2010funded projects (Hern\u00e1ndez-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2011; Sanchez, 2010).\nCurrent Smart City Data Analysis implies a wide set of activities aiming to turn into actionable data the outcome of complex analytics processes. This analysis comprises among others: i) analysis of thousands of traffic, pollution, weather, waste, energy and event sensory data to provide better services to the citizens, ii) event and incident analysis using near real-time data collected by citizens and devices\nsensors, iii) turning social media data related to city issues into event and sentiment analysis , and many others. Combining data from physical (sensors/devices) and social sources (social networks) can give more complete, complementary data and contributes to better analysis and insights. In overall, smart cities are complex social systems and large scale data analytics can contribute into their sustainability, efficient operation and welfare of the citizens.\nMotivated by the modern challenges in smart cities, the RADICAL approach (RADICAL, 2016) opens new horizons in the development, deployment and operation of interoperable social networking and Internet of Things services in smart cities, notably services that could be flexibly and successfully customized and replicated across multiple cities. Its main goal is to provide the means for cities and SMEs to rapidly develop, deploy, replicate, and evaluate a diverse set of sustainable ICT services that leverage established IoT and SN infrastructures. Application services deployed and pilotedinvolve: i) Cycling Safety Improvement, ii) Products Carbon Footprint Management, iii) Object\u2010driven Data Journalism, iv) Participatory Urbanism, v) Augmented Reality, vi) Eco\u2010 consciousness, vii) Sound map of a city and viii) City-R-Us: a crowdsourcing app for collecting movement information using citizens smartphones.\nThe RADICAL platform is an open platform having as added value the capability to easily replicate the services in other smart cities, the ability to co-design services with the involvement of cities' Living Labs, and the use of added value services that deal with the application development, the sustainability analysis and the governance of the services.\nThe RADICAL approach emphasizes on the sustainability of the services deployed, targeting both environmental sustainability and business viability. Relevant indicators (e.g., CO2 emissions, Citizens Satisfaction) are established and monitored as part of the platform evaluation.End users (citizens) in modern smart cities are increasingly looking for media\u2010rich services offered under different space\u2010, context\u2010, and situational conditions. The active participation and interaction of citizens can be a key enabler for successful and sustainable service deployments in future cities. Social networks hold the promise to boost such participation and interaction, thereby boosting participatory connected governance within the cities. However, in order to enable smart cities get insight information on how citizens think, act and talk about their city it is important to understand their opinion and sentiment polarity on\nissues related to their city context. This is where sentiment analysis can play a significant role. As social media data bring in significant Big Data challenges (especially for unstructured data streams) it will be important to find effective ways to analyse sentimentally those data for extracting value information and within specific time windows.\nThis paper has the following contributions:\n Innovative smart city infrastructure for uniform social and IoT big data aggregation\nand combination.\n Comperative study over Sentiment Analysis techniques efficiency, to reduce record,\nretrieval, update and processing time.\n A novel technique for n-grams storage and frequency representation in the context of big\ndata Sentiment Analysis.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of related and similar works that can be found in the international literature and in projects funded by the European Commission. Section 3 presents the RADICAL architecture and approach. Section 4 presents details about the Sentiment Analysis problem and related experiments, while in section 5 we provide the future work to be planned in the context of RADICAL and the conclusions we have come into."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "Recently, various analytical services such as sentiment analysis found their way into Internet of Things (IoT) applications. With the devices that are able to convey human messages over the internet meeting an exponential growth, the challenge now revolves around big data issues. Traditional approaches do not cope with the requirements posed from applications for analytics in e.g. high velocity rates or data volumes. As a result, the integration of IoT with social sensor data put common tasks like feature extraction, algorithm training or model updating to the test.\nMost of the algorithms are memory-resident and assume a small data size (He et al., 2010) and once this threshold is exceeded, the algorithms\u2019 accuracy and performance degrades to the point they are useless. Therefore even if we focused solely on volume challenges, it is intuitively expected that the accuracy of the supervised algorithms will be affected. An attempt from (Liu et al., 2013) to use Na\u00efve Bayes in an increasingly large data volume, showed that a rapid fall of the algorithms accuracy is followed by a continuous, smooth increase\nasymptotically tending from the lower end to the baseline (best accuracy under normal data load).\nRather than testing the algorithm\u2019s limitations, most of the other approaches are focusing on implementing parallel and distributed versions of the algorithms such as (He et al., 2010; Read et al., 2015). In fact most of them rely on the Map-Reduce framework so as to achieve high throughput classification (Amati et al., 2014; Sakaki et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012) whereas a number of toolkits have been presented with implementations of distributed or parallel versions of machine learning algorithms such as (\u201cApache Mahout: Scalable machine learning and data mining,\u201d n.d., \u201cMEKA: A Multi-label Extension to WEKA,\u201d n.d.; Bifet et al., 2010). While these solutions put most of the emphasis in the model and the optimization of the classification task in terms of accuracy and throughput, there is a rather small body of research dealing with the problem of feature extraction in high pace streams. The standard solution that is considered is the use of a sliding window and the application of standard feature extraction techniques in this small set. In cases where the stream\u2019s distribution is variable, a sliding window kappa-based measure has been proposed (Bifet and Frank, 2010).\nAs reported in (Strohbach et al., 2015), another domain of intense research in the area of scalable analytics is for an architecture that combines both batch and stream processing over social and IoT data while at the same time considering a single model for different types of documents (e.g. tweets Vs blogposts). Sentiment analysis is a typical task that requires batch modeling in order to generate the golden standards for each of the classes. This process is also the most computationally intense, as the classification task itself is usually a CPU bound task (i.e. run the classification function). In a data streaming scenario the golden standards must be updated in a batch mode, whereas the feature extraction and classification must take place in real time.\nPerhaps the most prominent example of such an architecture is the Lambda Architecture (Marz and Warren, 2015) pattern which solves the problem of computing arbitrary functions on arbitrary data in realtime by combining a batch layer for processing large scale historical data and a streaming layer for processing items being retrieved in real time from an input queue or analytics in e.g. high velocity rates or data volumes. As a result, the integration of IoT with social sensor data put common tasks like feature extraction, algorithm training or model updating to the test.Most of the algorithms are memory-resident and assume a small data size (He et al., 2010) and once this threshold is exceeded, the algorithms\u2019\naccuracy and performance degrades to the point they are useless. Therefore even if we focused solely on volume challenges, it is intuitively expected that the accuracy of the supervised algorithms will be affected. An attempt from Liu et al (Liu et al., 2013) to use Na\u00efve Bayes in an increasingly large data volume, showed that a rapid fall of the algorithms accuracy is followed by a continuous, smooth increase asymptotically tending from the lower end to the baseline (best accuracy under normal data load)."}, {"heading": "3. THE RADICAL APPROACH", "text": "The RADICAL platform integrates components and tools from (SocIoS, 2013) and (SmartSantander, 2013) projects, in order to support innovative smart city services, leveraging information stemming from Social Networks (SN) and Internet of Things devices. Using the aforementioned tools, it can collect, combine, analyze, process, visualize and provide uniform access to big datasets of Social Network content (e.g. tweets) and Internet of Things information (e.g. sensor measurements or citizen smartphone reports).\nThe architecture of the RADICAL platform is depicted in Figure 1. As can be observed, all IoT data are pushed into the platform through the respective Application Programming Interfaces (IoT API and Repository API) and are forwarded to the RADICAL Repository, comprised by a MySQL database, formed based on the RADICAL Object Model. The devicerelated data, as dictated by this object model, are saved in the form of Observations and Measurements. Observations correspond to general IoT events reported (e.g. a sensor report or bicycle \"check-in\" event), while Measurements to more specific metrics included in an Observation (e.g. Ozone measurements (mpcc) or bicycle current speed (km/h)). On the other hand, SN data are accessed in real time from the underlying SN adaptors, by communicating with the respective Networks\u2019 APIs. In cases of Social Networks like Foursquare that provide plain venues and statistics, the adaptor-like data structures do not make sense, thus relevant Social Enablers are used to retrieve venue-related information data.\nOn top of the main platform, RADICAL delivers a set of tools (Application Management layer) that allow end users to make better use of the RADICAL platform, such as configuring the registered IoT devices or extracting general activity statistics, through the RADICAL Configuration API. Lastly, the RADICAL Data API allows smart city services to\naccess the different sources of information (social networks, IoT infrastructures, city applications),\ncombine data and perform data analysis by using the appropriate platform tools.\nAs can be seen in the Service Application Layer, in the context of RADICAL a wide range of Smart City services of various scopes has been developed:\n Citizen journalism and Participatory Urbanism: Those two interrelated services\nallow citizens reporting events ofinterest in the city, by posting images, text and metadata through their smartphones.  Cycling Safety:Cyclists, acting as human sensors can report the situation in the city\nstreets through their smartphones.\n Monitoring the carbon footprint of products, people and services: By using a\nrange of sensors, the CO2 emissions in specific places in a city may be monitored.  Augmented Reality in Points of Interest (POI): Tourists use their smartphones to\nidentify and receive information about points of interest in a city.  Propagation of eco-consciousness:Leverages on the viral effect in the propagation of\ninformation in the social networks as well as\nthe recycling policy of a city, through monitoring and reporting relevant actions on citizens' smartphones.  Social-Orientated Urban Noise Decibel Measurement Application: Noise sensors are\nemployed throughout the city and citizens are able to report and comment noise-related information through SNs under a hashtag.  City Reporting application for the use of Urban Services: This service gathers sensory\ndata along with SN check-ins in city venues, to construct a traffic map throughout the city, leveraging the process load of anycentralized decision making process.\nThe aforementioned services are piloted in six European participating cities: Aarhus, Athens, Genoa, Issy les Moulineaux, Santander and the region of Cantabria. Figure 2illustrates a screenshot example of the RADICAL Cities' Dashboard, where general statistics on device registration and activity for a service throughout different cities in a specific time\nperiod is provided. In overall, during the last pilot iteration, RADICAL Repository had captured a total of 5.636 active IoT devices sending 728.253 Observations and 5.461.776 Measurements.\nMost of the services above depend on the aggregation of those IoTdata with social data\nstemming from online Social Network sites. E.g. in the Participatory Urbanism service, citizens' reports sent through smartphones and saved in RADICAL Repository are combined with relevant tweets (under a city service hashtag), as well as POI information that can be collected from similar SNs.\nThus, given the size of the datasets acquired by smart city services, along with the rich social media content that can be retrieved through the RADICAL platform adaptors, big data aggregation and analysis challenges arise. Data Analysis tools are the ones that further process the data in order to provide meaningful results to the end user, i.e. Event Detection or Sentiment Analysis.\nWhen it comes to Big Data, as in the RADICAL case, where millions of user-reported events are aggregated along with millions of SN posts and an extraction of general results is required, the challenge accrued is two-fold: First, the tool must ensure the accuracy of the analysis, in the sense that data classification is correct to a certain and satisfactory extent, and second, processing time must be kept under certain limits, so that results retrieval process delay is tolerable by end-users. Moreover, it is apparent in such analysis that a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency exists. The latter is a most crucial issue in Big Data analysis and apart from the policy followed in data querying (e.g. for queries preformed in an SQL database), it is also related to\nthe algorithmic techniques employed foranalyzing those datasets.\nIn the context of this work, we focus on the Sentiment Analysis on the big IoT and SN related datasets of RADICAL, as this was the most popular functionality among participating cities and almost all of the RADICAL Smart City services presented above make use of it. The goal of the Sentiment Analysis service is to extract sentiment expressive patterns from user-generated content in social networks or IoT-originated text posts. The service comes to the aid of the RADICAL city administrators, helping them to categorize polarized posts, meaning sentimentally charged text, e.g. analyse citizens\u2019 posts to separate subjective from objective opinions or count the overall positive and negative feedback, concerning a specific topic or event in the city."}, {"heading": "4. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS EXPERIMENTS AND", "text": "PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT"}, {"heading": "4.1 Introduction", "text": "The term Sentiment Analysis refers to an automatic classification problem. Its techniques are trying to distinguish between sentences of natural language conveying positive (e.g. happiness, pride, joy), negative (e.g. anger, sadness, jealously) or even neutral (no sentiment texts like statements, news, reports)emotion (called sentiment for our purposes) (Pang et al., 2002).\nA human being is capable of understanding a great variety of emotions from textual data. This process of understanding is based on complicated learning procedures that we all go through while using our language as a means of communication, be it actively or passively. It requires imagination and subjectivity in order to fully understand the meaning and hidden connections of each word in a sentence, two things that machines lack.\nThe most common practice is to extract numerical features out of the natural language (Godbole et al., 2007). This process translates this complex means of communication into something the machine can process."}, {"heading": "4.2 Natural Language Processing", "text": "In order to process the natural language data, the computer has to take some pre-processing actions. These actions include the cleansing of irrelevant, erroneous or redundant data and the transformation of the remaining data in a form more easily processed.\nCleansing the data has become a subjective task, depending on the purposes of each researcher and the chosen machine learning algorithms. The transformation of the sentences in another form now is clearly studied and each approach has some advantages and disadvantages. This paper will detail three approaches, two widely used and one that had some success in improving the accuracy of the algorithms: the bag of word, N-Gramsand N-Gram Graphs(Aisopos et al., 2012; Fan and Khademi, 2014; Giannakopoulos et al., 2008; Pang and Lee, 2008).\nThe bag of words approach is perhaps the most simple and common one. It regards each sentence as a set of words, disregarding their grammatical connections and neighbouring relations. It splits each sentence based on the space character (in most languages) and then forms a set of unrelated words (a bag of words as it is commonly called). Then each\nword in this bag can be disregarded or rated by a numerical value, in order to create a set of numbers instead of words.\nThe N-Grams are a bit more complex. They also form a bag of words but now each sentence is split into pseudo-words of equal length. A sliding window of N characters is rolling on the sentence creating this bag of pseudo-words. For example if N=3 the sentence \u201cThis is a nice weather we have today!\u201d will be split in the bag {\u2018Thi\u2019, \u2018his\u2019, \u2018is \u2019, \u2018s i\u2019, \u2018 is\u2019, \u2018is \u2019, \u2018s a\u2019, \u2018 a \u2019, \u2018a n\u2019, \u2018 ni\u2019, \u2018nic\u2019, \u2018ice\u2019, \u2018ce \u2019, \u2018e w\u2019, \u2018 we\u2019, \u2018wea\u2019, \u2018eat\u2019, \u2018ath\u2019, \u2018the\u2019, \u2018her\u2019, \u2018er \u2019, \u2018r w\u2019, \u2018 we\u2019, \u2018we \u2019, \u2018e h\u2019, \u2018 ha\u2019, \u2018hav\u2019, \u2018ave\u2019, \u2018ve \u2019, \u2018e t\u2019, \u2018 to\u2019, \u2018tod\u2019, \u2018oda\u2019, \u2018day\u2019, \u2018ay!\u2019}.\nThis technique takes into regard the direct neighbouring relations by creating a continuous stream of words, it still ignores the indirect relations between words and even the relations between the produced N-Grams. Of course it is impossible to have a predefined set of numerical ratings for each one of these pseudo-words because each sentence and each N number (which is defined arbitrarily by the researcher) produces a different set of pseudowords(Psomakelis et al., 2014). So machine learning is commonly used to replace these words with numerical values and create sets of numbers which can be aggregated to sentence level.\nAn improvement on that approach aims to take into consideration the neighbouring relations between the produced N-Grams. This approach is called NGram Graphs and its main concept is to create a graph connecting each N-Gram with its neighbours in the original sentence. So each node in this graph is an NGram and each edge is a neighbouring relation(Giannakopoulos et al., 2008). This approach gives a variety of new informationto the researchers and to the machine learning algorithms, including information about the context of words, making it a clear improvement of the simple N-Grams(Aisopos et al., 2012). The only drawbacks are the complexity it adds to the process and the difficulties of storing, accessing and updating a graph of textual data."}, {"heading": "4.3 Dataset Improvements", "text": "At the core of sentiment analysis is its dataset. We are gathering and employing bigger and bigger datasets in order to better train the algorithms to distinguish what is positive and what is negative. Classic storage techniques are proving more and more cumbersome for large datasets. ArrayLists and most Collections are adding a big overhead to the data so they are not only enlarging the space requirements for its storage but they are also delaying the analysis process. So new techniques for data storage and\nretrieval are needed, techniques that will enable us to store even bigger datasets and access them with even smaller delays.\nThe most commonly used such technique is the Hash List(Fan and Khademi, 2014), which first hashes the data in a certain, predefined amount of buckets and then creates a List in each bucket to resolve any collisions. This method\u2019s performance is heavily dependent on the quality of the hash function and its ability to equally split the data into the buckets. The target is to have as small lists as possible. That is the case because finding the right bucket for a certain piece of data is done in O(1) time but looking through the List in that bucket for the correct spot to store the piece of data is done in O(n) time where n is the number of data pieces in the List.\nMoreover, in Java which is the programming language that we are using, each List is an object containing one object for each data piece. All these objects create an overhead that is not to be ignored. In detail the estimated size that a hash list will occupy is calculated as:"}, {"heading": "12 + ((B \u2212 E) \u2217 12) + (E \u2217 4)", "text": "+ (U \u2217 (N \u2217 2 + 72)) Equation 1: Size estimation of Hash List where N=NGram Length, U=Unique NGrams, B=Bucket Size, E=Empty Buckets.\nThe worst case for storage but best for access time is when almost each data piece has its own bucket. In this case, for N=5, S=11881376, U=S, B=(26^N)*2, E=11914220, we have a storage size of 1110 MB. The best case for storage but worse for access time is when all data pieces are in a small number of buckets, in big lists. In this case for N=5, S=11881376, U=1, B=(26^N)/2, E=200610 we have a storage size of 23 MB. In an average case of N=5, S=11881376, U=7510766, B=26^N, E=2679046 we have 682 MB of storage space needed. The sample for the above examples was the complete range of 5-Grams for the 26 lowercase English characters which are 26^5 = 11881376.\nOur proposed technique now, the one that we call Dimensional Mapping, has a standard storage space, depending only on the length of the N-Grams. The idea is to store only the weight of each N-Gram with the N-Gram itself being the pointer to where it is stored. That is achieved by creating an N-dimensional array of integers where each character of the N-Gram is used as an index. So, in order to access the weight of the 5-Gram \u2018fdsgh\u2019 in the table DM we would just read the value in cell DM[\u2018f\u2019][\u2018d\u2019][\u2018s\u2019][\u2018g\u2019][\u2018h\u2019]. A very simple mapping is used between the characters and an integers: after a very strict cleansing process\nwhere we convert all characters in lowercase and discard all characters but the 26 in the English alphabet, we are just subtracting the ASCII value of \u2018a\u2019. Due to the serial nature of the characters that gives us an integer between 0 and 26 that we can use as an index. A more complex mapping can be used in order to include more characters or even punctuation that we now ignore.\nThe Dimensional Mapping has a standard storage size requirement, dependent only on the length of the N-Grams as we mentioned before. The size it occupies can be estimated by the following formula:\n(26\ud835\udc41) \u2217 4 + \u2211 ((26\ud835\udc41\u2212\ud835\udc56) \u2217 12)\n\ud835\udc56=\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc56=1\nEquation 2: Dimensional Mapping size estimation with N being the length of N-Grams.\nThis may seem large but for the 5-Grams the estimated size is just 51 MB. Compared to the worst case of Hash Lists (1110 MB) or even the average case (682 MB) it seems like a huge improvement. This is caused due to the fact that the multidimensional array stores primitive values and not objects, which reduces the overhead greatly. Moreover, we can now say that accessing and updating a certain data piece can be done in O(1) time with absolute certainty, with no dependency on the data itself or a hash function. This had significant results in speeding up the execution times of the analysis, enabling us to look into streaming data and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms."}, {"heading": "4.4 Results", "text": "We measured three main KPIs for the result comparison. Two of them (success ratio, kappa variable) were measuring the success ratio of classification and one (execution time) the algorithmic improvement. We present them bellow.\nWe run experiments on 5-Grams stored in classic ArrayList format, in Hash Lists and in Dimensional Mapping. After storing the N-Grams in these formats we applied a 10-fold cross validation on each one of the seven machine learning algorithms we chose: Na\u00efve Bayesian Networks, C4.5, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptrons, Best-First Trees and Functional Trees. Then we recorded the three KPIs for each one of these 21 experiments. The results for the first two KPIs are shown in the bar chart that follows.
