Introduction", "text": "The concept of planning, as a part of decision theory, in the AI literature has a long history. It is the bases for a variety of popular agent-environment interaction problems like Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is an effective approach to solve the problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty. RL agents learn how to maximize longterm reward using a experience obtained by direct interaction with a stochastic environment (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996; Sutton and Barto, 1998). Since the environment is initially unknown, the agent has to balance between exploring the environment to estimate its structure, and exploiting the estimates to compute a policy that maximizes the long-term reward. As a result, designing a RL algorithm requires three different elements: 1) an\nc\u00a9 2016 K. Azizzadenesheli, A. Lazaric & A. Anandkumar.\nestimator for the environment\u2019s structure, 2) a planning algorithm to compute the optimal policy of the estimated environment (LaValle, 2006), and 3) a strategy to make a trade off between exploration and exploitation to minimize the regret, i.e., the difference between the performance of the exact optimal policy and the rewards accumulated by the agent over time.\nMost of RL literature assumes that the environment can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), with a Markovian state evolution that is fully observed. A number of exploration\u2013exploitation strategies have been shown to have strong performance guarantees for MDPs, either in terms of regret or sample complexity Auer et al. (2009). However, the assumption of full observability of the state evolution is often violated in practice, and the agent may have only noisy observations of the true state of the environment (e.g., noisy sensors in robotics). In this case, it is more appropriate to use the partially-observable MDP (POMDP) (Sondik, 1971) model.\nMany challenges arise in designing RL algorithms for POMDPs. Unlike in MDPs, the estimation problem (element 1) involves identifying the parameters of a latent variable model (LVM). The planning problem (element 2), i.e., computing the optimal policy for a POMDP with known parameters, is PSPACE-complete (Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis, 1987), and it requires solving an augmented MDP built on a continuous belief space (i.e., a distribution over the hidden state of the POMDP). Finally, integrating estimation and planning in an exploration\u2013exploitation strategy (element 3) with guarantees is non-trivial and no no-regret strategies are currently known. Previous works Ross et al. (2007) and Poupart and Vlassis (2008) present new active learning algorithms to estimate the belief state in a model-based Bayesian RL approach, where a distribution over possible MDPs is updated over time. The proposed algorithms are such that the Bayesian inference can be done at each step, a POMDP is sampled from the posterior and the corresponding optimal policy is executed. The regret bound and sample complexity are not provided.\nRecently, the learning POMDP model parameter and imposing trade off between exploration and estimation (elements 1 and 3), are done at Azizzadenesheli et al. (2016). They propose the theoretical guaranty on regret bound given the oracle memoryless policy. Therefore to close the learning, planing, and exploration-exploitation loop, the missing part, planning (element 2), is the remaining part. Therefore, planing is a problem of finding the optimal memoryless policy, under uncertainty, in the class of stochastic memoryless polices. The overview complexity of planing in POMDP domain is discussed in Kaelbling et al. (1998)."}, {"heading": "2.

In addition fT denotes the transition density, so that fT (x\u2032|x, a) is the probability of transition to x\u2032 given the state-action pair (x, a), fR is the reward density, so that fR(r|x, a) is the probability of receiving the reward in R corresponding to the value\nof the indicator vector r given the state-action pair (x, a), and fO is the observation density, so that fO(y|x) is the probability of receiving the observation in Y corresponding to the indicator vector y given the state x.

The graphical model associated to the POMDP is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nWe focus on stochastic memoryless policies which map observations to actions and for any policy \u03c0 we denote by f\u03c0(a|y) its density function.

Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an agent-environment interaction problem, has brought further attention to planning methods. Generally in RL, one can assume a generative model, e.g. graphical models, for the environment, and then the task for the RL agent is to learn the model parameters and find the optimal strategy based on these learnt parameters. Based on environment behavior, the agent can assume various types of generative models, e.g. Multi Armed Bandit for a static environment, or Markov Decision Process (MDP) for a dynamic environment. The advantage of these popular models is their simplicity, which results in tractable methods of learning the parameters and finding the optimal policy. The drawback of these models is again their simplicity: these models usually underfit and underestimate the actual environment behavior. For example, in robotics, the agent usually has noisy observations of the environment inner state and MDP is not a suitable model. More complex models like Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) can compensate for this drawback. Fitting this model to the environment, where the partial observation is given to the agent, generally gives dramatic performance improvement, sometimes unbounded improvement, compared to MDP.
