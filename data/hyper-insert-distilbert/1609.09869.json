Introduction", "text": "Models of sequence data such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in machine translation, speech recognition, and computational biology. Linear and non-linear Gaussian state space models (GSSMs, Fig. 1) are used in applications including robotic planning and missile tracking. However, despite huge progress over the last decade, efficient learning of non-linear models from complex high dimensional time-series remains a major challenge. Our paper proposes a unified learning algorithm for a broad class of GSSMs, and we introduce an inference procedure that scales easily to high dimensional data, compiling approximate (and where feasible, exact) inference into the parameters of a neural network.\nIn engineering and control, the parametric form of the GSSM model is often known, with typically a few specific parameters that need to be fit to data. The most commonly used approaches for these types of learning and inference problems are often computationally demanding, e.g. dual extended Kalman filter (Wan and Nelson, 1996), expectation maximization (Briegel and Tresp, 1999; Roweis and Ghahramani, 2000) or particle filters (Sch\u00f6n et al., 2011). Our compiled inference algorithm can easily deal with high-dimensions both in the observed and the latent spaces, without compromising the quality of inference and learning.\nWhen the parametric form of the model is unknown, we propose learning deep Markov models (DMM), a class of generative models where classic linear emission and transition distributions are replaced with complex multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). These are GSSMs that retain the Markovian\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n09 86\n9v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n3 0\nstructure of HMMs, but leverage the representational power of deep neural networks to model complex high dimensional data. If one augments a DMM model such as the one presented in Fig. 1 with edges from the observations xt to the latent states of the following time step zt+1, then the DMM can be seen to be similar to, though more restrictive than, stochastic RNNs (Bayer and Osendorfer, 2014) and variational RNNs (Chung et al., 2015).\nOur learning algorithm performs stochastic gradient ascent on a variational lower bound of the likelihood. Instead of introducing variational parameters for each data point, we compile the inference procedure at the same time as learning the generative model. This idea was originally used in the wake-sleep algorithm for unsupervised learning (Hinton et al., 1995), and has since led to state-of-the-art results for unsupervised learning of deep generative models (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Mnih and Gregor, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014).\nSpecifically, we introduce a new family of structured inference networks, parameterized by recurrent neural networks, and evaluate their effectiveness in three scenarios: (1) when the generative model is known and fixed, (2) in parameter estimation when the functional form of the model is known and (3) for learning deep Markov models. By looking at the structure of the true posterior, we show both theoretically and empirically that inference for a latent state should be performed using information from its future, as opposed to recent work which performed inference using only information from the past (Chung et al., 2015; Gan et al., 2015; Gregor et al., 2015). We also outperform mean-field based approaches. Finally, we learn a DMM on a polyphonic music dataset and on a dataset of electronic health records (a complex high dimensional setting with missing data). We use the model learned on health records to ask queries such as \u201cwhat would have happened to patients had they not received treatment\u201d, and show that our model correctly identifies the way certain medications affect a patient\u2019s health.\nRelated Work: Learning GSSMs with MLPs for the transition distribution was considered by (Raiko and Tornio, 2009). They approximate the posterior with non-linear dynamic factor analysis (Valpola and Karhunen, 2002), which scales quadratically with the observed dimension and is impractical for large-scale learning.\nRecent work has also considered variational learning of time-series data using inference or recognition networks. Archer et al. (2015) propose using a block-diagonal Gaussian approximation to the posterior, parameterized by neural networks. Johnson et al. (2016) consider learning structured time-series models by approximating the posterior distribution with conditional random fields. Bayer and Osendorfer (2014) and Fabius and van Amersfoort (2014) create a stochastic variant of RNNs by making the hidden state of the RNN at every time step be a function of independently sampled latent variables. Chung et al. (2015) apply a similar model to speech data, sharing parameters between the RNNs for the generative model and the inference network. Gan et al. (2015) learn a model with\ndiscrete random variables, using a structured inference network that only considers information from the past, similar to Chung et al. (2015) and Gregor et al. (2015). In contrast to these works, we use information from the future within a structured inference network, which we show to be preferable both theoretically and practically. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the impact of the different variational approximations on learning. Watter et al. (2015) construct a first-order Markov model using inference networks. However, their learning algorithm is based on data tuples over consecutive time steps. This makes the strong assumption that the posterior distribution can be recovered based on observations at the current and next time-step. As we show, for generative models like the one in Fig. 1, the posterior distribution at any time step is a function of all future observations.\nThis paper expands an earlier work (Krishnan et al. 2015). The current paper instantiates the inference scheme presented in (Krishnan et al., 2015) [Thm. 5.1] with a specific neural architecture, evalutes several experimental benchmarks, and explores in depth the impact of inference on learning. We also revamped the names of the underlying inference scheme, based on suggestions made by reviewers."}, {"heading": "2. Background", "text": "Gaussian State Space Models: We consider both inference and learning in a class of latent variable models given by:\nzt \u223c N (G\u03b1(zt\u22121,\u2206t), S\u03b2(zt\u22121,\u2206t)) (Transition) xt \u223c \u03a0(F\u03ba(zt)) (Emission) (1)\nWe assume that the distribution of the latent states is a multivariate Gaussian with a mean and covariance which are differentiable functions of the previous latent state. The multivariate observations xt are distributed according to a distribution \u03a0 (e.g., independent Bernoullis if the data is binary) whose parameters are a function of the corresponding latent state zt. Collectively, we denote by \u03b8 = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03ba} the parameters of the generative model. Eq. 1 subsumes a large family of linear and non-linear Gaussian state space models. For example, by setting G\u03b1(zt\u22121) = Gtzt\u22121, S\u03b2 = \u03a3t,F\u03ba = Ftzt we obtain linear state space models. The functional forms and initial parameters for G\u03b1, S\u03b2,F\u03ba may be pre-specified.\nVariational Learning: Using recent advances in variational inference we optimize a variational lower bound on the data log-likelihood. The key technical innovation is the introduction of an inference network or recognition network (Hinton et al., 1995), a neural network which approximates the intractable posterior. This is a parametric conditional distribution that is optimized to perform inference. Throughout this paper we will use \u03b8 to denote the parameters of the generative model, and \u03c6 to denote the parameters of the inference network.\nLet p(x, z) = p\u03b8(z)p\u03b8(x|z) be a generative model for the set of observations x. The posterior distribution p\u03b8(z|x) is typically intractable. Using the well-known variational principle, we posit an approximate posterior distribution q\u03c6(z|x) to obtain the following lower bound on the marginal likelihood:\nlog p\u03b8(x) \u2265 E q\u03c6(z|x) [log p\u03b8(x|z)]\u2212KL( q\u03c6(z|x)||p\u03b8(z) ), (2)\nwhere the inequality is by Jensen\u2019s inequality. Kingma and Welling (2014); Rezende et al. (2014) use a neural net (with parameters \u03c6) to parameterize q\u03c6. The challenge in the resulting optimization problem is that the lower bound (2) includes an expectation w.r.t. q\u03c6, which implicitly depends on the network parameters \u03c6. This difficulty is overcome by using stochastic backpropagation. We\nuse a Normally distributed variational approximation: ie. q\u03c6(z|x) \u223c N (\u00b5\u03c6(x),\u03a3\u03c6(x)), where \u00b5\u03c6(x),\u03a3\u03c6(x) are functions of the observation x which parameterize the Normal distribution. Using this assumption, a simple transformation allows one to obtain unbiased Monte Carlo estimates of the gradients of Eq\u03c6(z|x) [log p\u03b8(x|z)] with respect to \u03c6. The KL term in (2) can be estimated similarly since it is also an expectation. If we assume the prior p\u03b8(z) is also Normally distributed, the KL and its gradients may be obtained analytically."}, {"heading": "3. A Factorized Variational Lower Bound", "text": "We leverage stochastic back-propagation to learn generative models given by Eq. 1, corresponding to the graphical model in Figure 1. Our insight is that for the purpose of inference, we can use the Markov properties of the generative model to guide us in deriving a structured approximation to the posterior. Specifically, the posterior factorizes as:\np(~z|~x) = p(z1|~x) T\u220f t=2 p(zt|zt\u22121, xt, . . . , xT ). (3)\nThis factorization follows from conditional independencies in the model and is detailed in Appendix C. We directly mimic the structure of the posterior with the following factorization of the variational approximation:\nq\u03c6(~z|~x) = T\u220f t=1 q\u03c6(zt|zt\u22121, xt, . . . , xT ) (4) s.t. q\u03c6(zt|zt\u22121, xt, . . . , xT ) \u223c N (\u00b5\u03c6(zt\u22121, xt, . . . , xT ),\u03a3\u03c6(zt\u22121, xt, . . . , xT ))\nwhere \u00b5\u03c6 and \u03a3\u03c6 are functions parameterized by neural nets. Although q\u03c6 has the option to condition on all information across time, Eq. 3 suggests that in fact it suffices to condition on information from the future and the previous latent state. The previous latent state serves as a summary statistic for information from the past.\nDeriving a Variational Lower Bound: For a generative model (with parameters \u03b8) and an inference network (with parameters \u03c6), we are interested in max\u03b8 log p\u03b8(~x). For ease of exposition, we instantiate the derivation of the variational bound for a single data point ~x though we learn \u03b8, \u03c6 from a dataset.\nThe lower bound in Eq. 2 has an analytic form of the KL term only for the simplest of transition models G\u03b1, S\u03b2 between zt\u22121 and zt (Eq. 1). One could estimate the gradient of the KL term by sampling from the variational model, but that results in high variance estimates and gradients. We use a different factorization of the KL term, leading to the variational lower bound we use as our objective function:\nL(~x; (\u03b8, \u03c6)) = T\u2211 t=1 E q\u03c6(zt|~x) [log p\u03b8(xt|zt)]\u2212KL(q\u03c6(z1|~x)||p\u03b8(z1)) (5)\n\u2212 T\u2211 t=2 E q\u03c6(zt\u22121|~x) [KL(q\u03c6(zt|zt\u22121, ~x)||p\u03b8(zt|zt\u22121))] .\nThe derivation of the bound and the factorization of the KL divergence is detailed in Appendix A,B. The key point is the resulting objective function has stable analytic gradients, since the KL divergence does not need to be approximated with Monte-Carlo estimation.\nLearning with Gradient Descent: The objective in Eq. 6 is differentiable in the parameters of the model (\u03b8, \u03c6). If the generative model \u03b8 is fixed, we perform gradient ascent of (6) in \u03c6. Otherwise, we perform gradient ascent in both \u03c6 and \u03b8. We use stochastic backpropagation (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) for estimating the gradient w.r.t. \u03c6. Note that the expectations are only taken with respect to the variables zt\u22121, zt, which are the sufficient statistics of the Markov model. This is in contrast to the variational bound obtained by Chung et al. (2015) in Eq. 7 of their paper, where expectations are taken over all past latent states. For the KL terms in Eq. 6, we use the fact that the prior p\u03b8(zt|zt\u22121) and the variational approximation to the posterior q\u03c6(zt|zt\u22121, ~x) are both normally distributed, and hence their KL divergence may be estimated analytically (see Appendix B)."}, {"heading": "4. Structured Inference Networks", "text": "We now detail the way we construct the variational approximation q\u03c6, and specifically how we model the mean and diagonal covariance functions \u00b5\u03c6 and \u03a3\u03c6 using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This parameterization cannot in general be expected to be equal to p\u03b8(z|x), but in many cases is a reasonable approximation. We use RNNs due to their high model capacity and ability to scale well to large datasets.\nTable 1 details the different choices for inference networks that we evaluate. The Deep Kalman Smoother, DKS, corresponds exactly to the functional form suggested by Eq. 3, and is our proposed variational approximation. The DKS smoothes information from the past (zt) and future (xt, . . . xT ) to form the approximate posterior.\nWe also evaluate other possibilities for the variational models (inference networks) q\u03c6: two are mean-field models (denoted MF) and two are structured models (denoted ST). They are distinguished by whether they use information from the past (denoted L, for left), the future (denoted R, for right), or both (denoted LR). See Figure 2 for an illustration of two of these methods. Each conditions on a different subset of the observations to summarize information in the input sequence ~x. DKS corresponds to ST-R.\nThe hidden states of the RNN are used to parameterize the parameters of the variational distribution, which go through what we call the \u201ccombiner function\u201d. We obtain the mean \u00b5q and diagonal covariance \u03c32q for the posterior at each time-step in a manner akin to Gaussian belief propagation. Specifically, we interpret the hidden states of the forward and backward RNNs as parameterizing the mean and variance of two Gaussian-distributed \u201cmessages\u201d summarizing the observations from the past and the future, respectively. We then multiply these two Gaussians, performing a varianceweighted average of the means. All operations should be understood to be performed element-wise on the corresponding vectors.\nCombiner Function for Mean Field Approximations: For the MF-LR inference network, the mean \u00b5t and covariance \u03a3t of the variational distribution q\u03c6(zt|~x) are predicted using the output of\nthe RNN (not conditioned on zt\u22121) as follows, where Softplus(x) = log(1 + exp(x)):\n\u00b5r = W right \u00b5r h right t + b right \u00b5r ; \u03c3 2 r = Softplus(W right \u03c32r h right t + b right \u03c32r ) \u00b5l = W left \u00b5l hleftt + b left \u00b5l ; \u03c32l = Softplus(W left \u03c32l hleftt + b left \u03c32l )\n\u00b5q = \u00b5r\u03c3\n2 l + \u00b5l\u03c3 2 r\n\u03c32r + \u03c3 2 l\n; \u03c32q = \u03c32r \u03c3 2 l\n\u03c32r + \u03c3 2 l\nCombiner Function for Structured Approximations: Since the posterior p\u03b8(zt | zt\u22121, ~x) \u221d p\u03b8(zt | x1, . . . , xt\u22121, zt\u22121)p\u03b8(xt, . . . , xT | zt), a similar reasoning as above suggests that we should use a weighted sum of information from the left and right. The combiner functions for the structured approximations are implemented as:\n(For ST-LR) hcombined = 1\n3 (Tanh(Wzt\u22121 + b) + h\nleft t + h right t ),\n(For DKS) hcombined = 1\n2 (Tanh(Wzt\u22121 + b) + h\nright t ),\n\u00b5q = W\u00b5qhcombined + b\u00b5q (Posterior Means and Covariances) \u03c32q = Softplus(W\u03c32qhcombined + b\u03c32q )\nThe combiner function uses the Tanh non-linearity from zt\u22121 to approximate the transition function (alternatively, one could share parameters with the generative model), and here we use a simple weighting between the components.\nt ) respectively. Then through a\nfurther sequence of non-linearities which we call the \u201ccombiner function\u201d (marked (a) above), and denoted by the red arrows, it outputs two vectors \u00b5 and \u03a3, parameterizing the mean and diagonal covariance of q\u03c6(zt|zt\u22121, ~x) of Eq. 4. Samples z\u0302t are drawn from q\u03c6(zt|zt\u22121, ~x), as indicated by the black dashed arrows. For the structured variational models ST-LR, the samples z\u0302t are fed into the computation of \u00b5t+1 and \u03a3t+1, as indicated by the red arrows with the label (a). The mean-field model does not have these arrows, and therefore computes q\u03c6(zt|~x). We use z\u03020 = ~0.

(2006), we apply the ideas of deep learning to non-linear continuous state space models. Where the transition and emission function have an unknown functional form, we parameterize G\u03b1, S\u03b2,F\u03ba from Eq. 1 with deep neural networks. See Figure 1 (right) for an illustration of the graphical model.\nEmission Function: We parameterize the emission function F\u03ba using a two-layer MLP (multilayer perceptron), MLP(x,NL1,NL2) = NL2(W2NL1(W1x+ b1) + b2)), where NL denotes nonlinearities such as ReLU, sigmoid, or Tanh units applied element-wise to the input vector. For modeling binary data, F\u03ba(zt) = Sigmoid(WemissionMLP(zt,ReLU,ReLU)+bemission) parameterizes the mean probabilities of independent Bernoullis.\nGated Transition Function: Instead of MLPs, we use a gated transition function inspired by Gated Recurrent Units (Chung et al., 2014). Gated recurrent units (GRUs) are a neural architecture that parameterizes the recurrence equation in the RNN with gating units to control the flow of information from one hidden state to the next, conditioned on the observation. Unlike GRUs, in the DMM, the transition function is not conditional on any of the observations. All the information must be encoded in the completely stochastic latent state. To achieve this goal, we create a Gated Transition Function. We would like the model to have the flexibility to choose a linear transition for some dimensions while having a non-linear transitions for the others. We adopt the following parameterization, where I denotes the identity function and denotes element-wise multiplication: Using the notation for MLP from the main paper.

(1)), where ut is a binary indicator vector of eight diabetic drugs including Metformin and Insulin. Metformin is the most commonly prescribed first-line anti-diabetic drug.\n\u2022 A subset of the observations (such as A1C and Glucose values) is frequently missing in the data. We marginalize them out during learning, which is straightforward within the probabilistic semantics of our Bayesian network.\n\u2022 The choice of emission and transition function to use for such data is not well understood. In Figure 5 (right), we experiment with variants of DMMs and find that using MLPs (rather than linear functions) in the emission and transition function yield the best (in terms of held-out likelihood) generative models.\nModeling the effect of Diabetic Medications: Since our cohort comprises diabetic patients, we ask what would have happened to a patient had diabetic drugs not been prescribed? We perform inference using held-out patient data leading up to the time k of first prescription of Metformin. From the posterior mean, we perform ancestral sampling tracking two latent trajectories: (1) the factual: where we sample new latent states conditioned on the medication ut the patient had actually received and (2) the counterfactual: where we sample conditioned on not receiving any drugs for all remaining timesteps (i.e uk set to the zero-vector). We reconstruct the patient observations xk, . . . , xT , threshold the predicted values of A1C levels into high and low and visualize the average number of highs A1C levels we observe among the synthetic patients in both scenarios. This is an example of performing do-calculus (Pearl, 2009) in order to estimate model-based counterfactual effects.\nThe results are shown in Figure 5. We see the model learns that, on average, patients who were prescribed diabetes medication had more controlled levels of A1C than patients who did not receive any medication. Despite being an aggregate effect, this is interesting because it is a phenomenon that coincides with our intuition but was confirmed by the model in an entirely unsupervised manner. Note that in our model, most diabetic patients are indeed prescribed medications, making the counterfactual prediction harder. The ability of this model to answer such queries opens up possibilities into building personalized neural models of healthcare. Further experiments, samples from the learned generative model and implementation details may be found in the appendix."}, {"heading": "7. Discussion", "text": "We introduce a general algorithm for scalable learning in a rich family of latent variable models for time-series data. The space complexity of our learning algorithm depends neither on the sequence length T nor on the training set size N , offering massive savings compared to classical variational inference methods. Since we use RNNs only in the inference network, it should be possible to continue to increase their capacity and condition on different modalities that might be relevant to posterior inference without worry of overfitting the data.

Generative Models of Medical Data", "text": "Data from Electronic Health Records is noisy, high dimensional and difficult to characterize easily. Patient records are rarely contiguous over large parts of the dataset and data is often missing (not at random). Modeling such data is a challenging task. We use the DMM for this since:\n\u2022 The generative model of a DMM naturally expresses the idea of a time-evolving latent state of the patient (zt)\n\u2022 The deep neural networks are capable of representing arbitrarily complex non-linear functions, justifying their use in modeling the unknown emission and transition functions\nGraphical Model: As described in the main paper, we augment the DMM with an additional edge every time step from an external input ut that represents the (binary) set of medications that are prescribed to the patient. Figure 10 represents the generative model when T = 4. The additional dotted edges in the Bayesian network exist but never need to be modeled since xt and ut are always assumed to be observed in the scenarios that we evaluate. A natural line of follow up work would be to consider learning when ut is missing or latent.\n.\nLearning in the Presence of Missing Data: In the original patient data, A1C and Glucose values are not measured at every visit. To deal with this difficulty, we marginalize out missing values during learning. The sub-network of the original graph we are concerned with is the emission function since missingness affects our ability to evaluate log p(xt|zt). However, as we will show, this marginalization is not difficult since the missing random variables are leaves in the Bayesian sub-network (comprised of the emission function). To illustrate this, consider the case where we are modelling two observations at time t, namely mt, ot. The log-likelihood of the data (mt, ot) conditioned on the latent variable zt decomposes as log p(mt, ot|zt) = log p(mt|zt) + log p(ot|zt) since the random variables are conditionally independent given their parent.\nNow, ifm is missing and we wish to marginalize it out, while ot is observed then our log-likelihood is now: log \u222b m p(mt, ot|zt) = log( \u222b m p(mt|zt)p(ot|zt)) = log p(ot|zt) (since \u222b m p(mt|zt) = 1) i.e we effectively ignore the missing observations when estimating the log-likelihood of the data. In our data, we have indicators denoting whether or not the A1C values and Glucose values were observed which we use as markers of missingness. During batch learning, at every time-step t, we obtain a matrix B = log p(xt|zt) of size (batch-size \u00d7 48) comprising the log-likelihoods of every dimension for patients in the batch. We multiply this with a matrix of M . M has the same dimensions as B and has a 1 if the patient\u2019s A1C value was observed and a 0 otherwise. For dimensions that are never missing, M is always 1.\nModel Parameterizations for Medical Data: We first investigate the different choices to parameterize the emission and transition distribution for the medical data. We consider linear and non-linear functions. In the linear case, the mean and log-covariances in the transition function are parameterized as linear functions of the previous latent state. The non-linear functions are parameterized by two layer MLPs. The results in Figure\n11 suggest that a non-linear emission and non-linear transition is important in order to be able to model the data, though a linear transition function might work almost as well. Based on this insight, we use non-linear functions in the emission and transition distribution of the DMM. The hidden dimension was set as 200 for the emission and transition functions. We used an RNN size of 400 and a latent dimension of size 50.\nSampling a Patient: We visualize samples from the DMM in Figure 12 The model captures correlations within timesteps as well as variations in A1C level and Glucose level across timesteps. It also appears to capture the rare occurrences of comorbidities that are found amongst diabetic patients.\nUpper Bound on Validation Data\nTransition-[NL]-Emission-[NL]\nTransition-[L]-Emission-[L]\nTransition-[NL]-Emission-[L]\nTransition-[L]-Emission-[NL]"}], "references": [{"title": "Black box variational inference for state space models", "author": ["Evan Archer", "Il Memming Park", "Lars Buesing", "John Cunningham", "Liam Paninski"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.07367,", "citeRegEx": "Archer et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Archer et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Learning stochastic recurrent networks", "author": ["Justin Bayer", "Christian Osendorfer"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1411.7610,", "citeRegEx": "Bayer and Osendorfer.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bayer and Osendorfer.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Modeling temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences: Application to polyphonic music generation and transcription", "author": ["Nicolas Boulanger-lewandowski", "Yoshua Bengio", "Pascal Vincent"], "venue": "In ICML,", "citeRegEx": "Boulanger.lewandowski et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Boulanger.lewandowski et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Fisher scoring and a mixture of modes approach for approximate inference and learning in nonlinear state space models", "author": ["Thomas Briegel", "Volker Tresp"], "venue": "In NIPS,", "citeRegEx": "Briegel and Tresp.,? \\Q1999\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Briegel and Tresp.", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on sequence modeling", "author": ["Junyoung Chung", "Caglar Gulcehre", "KyungHyun Cho", "Yoshua Bengio"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.3555,", "citeRegEx": "Chung et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chung et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "A recurrent latent variable model for sequential data", "author": ["Junyoung Chung", "Kyle Kastner", "Laurent Dinh", "Kratarth Goel", "Aaron Courville", "Yoshua Bengio"], "venue": "In NIPS,", "citeRegEx": "Chung et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chung et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Kalman filter, kalman smoother, and em library for python", "author": ["Daniel Duckworth"], "venue": "https://pykalman. github.io/,", "citeRegEx": "Duckworth.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Duckworth.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Variational recurrent auto-encoders", "author": ["Otto Fabius", "Joost R van Amersfoort"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Fabius and Amersfoort.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Fabius and Amersfoort.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Deep temporal sigmoid belief networks for sequence modeling", "author": ["Zhe Gan", "Chunyuan Li", "Ricardo Henao", "David E Carlson", "Lawrence Carin"], "venue": "In NIPS,", "citeRegEx": "Gan et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gan et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "DRAW: A recurrent neural network for image generation", "author": ["Karol Gregor", "Ivo Danihelka", "Alex Graves", "Danilo Jimenez Rezende", "Daan Wierstra"], "venue": "In ICML,", "citeRegEx": "Gregor et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gregor et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Neural adaptive sequential monte carlo", "author": ["Shixiang Gu", "Zoubin Ghahramani", "Richard E Turner"], "venue": "In NIPS,", "citeRegEx": "Gu et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gu et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "The\" wake-sleep\" algorithm for unsupervised neural networks", "author": ["Geoffrey E Hinton", "Peter Dayan", "Brendan J Frey", "Radford M Neal"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Hinton et al\\.,? \\Q1995\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Hinton et al\\.", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Structured VAEs: Composing probabilistic graphical models and variational autoencoders", "author": ["Matthew J Johnson", "David Duvenaud", "Alexander B Wiltschko", "Sandeep R Datta", "Ryan P Adams"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.06277,", "citeRegEx": "Johnson et al\\.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Johnson et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "How to Train Deep Variational Autoencoders and Probabilistic Ladder Networks", "author": ["C.
