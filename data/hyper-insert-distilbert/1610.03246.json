Introduction", "text": "NELL (Never-Ending Language Learner) [1] is a computer system that runs 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. It was started up on January, 12th, 2010 and should be running forever, reading the web and gathering more and more facts to grow and populate its own knowledge base.\nIn short, we can describe the system as follows: NELL's initial knowledge base (KB) is an ontology defining hundreds of categories (e.g., athlete, sports, sportsTeam, fruit, product, country, city, emotion, etc.) and relations (e.g., athletePlaysForTeam (athlete, sportsTeam), cityLocatedInCountry (city, country)) and a set of 10 to 15 examples (instances) for each one of the categories (e.g. athlete (Kobe Bryant), sportsTeam(LA Lakers), etc.) and for each one of the relations (e.g. athletePlaysForTeam (Kobe Bryant, LA Lakers), cityLocatedInCountry (New York, USA), etc.). Publications that explain in more detail about NELL and that support the current project can be found in [1], [4], [5] and [6]. The publication [7] is the last publication about all the system and currently components.\nThe standard process of NELL is depicted in Figure 1 in a simple and generic view. As shown in this figure, the input is the all-pairs-data and the ontology/knowledge base (KB), the output is the ontology/knowledge base. Let\u2019s explain better each part of the process.\nThe present document describes what is necessary to setting up a new NELL instance in a different language. In resume, it is necessary an ontology and\nto create a new NELL instance were published for the first time for the Portuguese NELL version ([3, 2]), and for the second time for the French version. This document is based on these publications and experiences."}, {"heading": "2. NELL\u2019s input", "text": "The input of NELL is the web. NELL reads and learn from webpages. NELL learns all time, \u201cforever\u201d. NELL\u2019s key is to read and understand better each day. We can imagine a human reading a book on an unknown subject, and as much the human reads the book, as much knowledge he is able to extract. NELL does a similar task: it reads the web a lot of times (call \u201citerations\u201d), which requires a lot of time and resources. From the text, NELL pre-processes a source base called All-Pairs-Data."}, {"heading": "3. A preprocessed source base: All-Pairs-Data", "text": "An All-Paris-Data is made using a big corpus and stores all occurrences and co-occurrences between Named Entities (NE) and Textual Patterns (TP) in two views: Categories and Relations.\nCategories is the learning of a unary relation. For example the Category City can have the unary relation: City(New York). Relations is the learning of a binary relation. For example the Relation LocatedIn(New York,USA). For\nwhile for relations it extracts one pair of instances for predicate (New York, USA).\nAn All-Pairs-Data is created for Categories and Relations or just for Categories. For Categories the all-pairs will consist of all occurrences between a TP and a NE. For Relations all occurrences between a pair of NE\u2019s and a TP.\nIt is shown in the Tables 1 and 2 one simple example for an All-Pairs-Data of Category (Table 1) and another of Relation (Table 2). In these tables we have the number of occurrences between NE and TP for categories, and between a pair of NEs and a TP for relations. When NELL learns, NELL makes the math to discover and count the co-occurrence.\nThe NE and TP extractions are guided by a part-of-speech / Tagging process. Any other approaches can be applied for extracted the NE and TP. The only important thing is that the NE and TP identified are not modified. In other words, it\u2019s important to keep the strings as it was found on the original text. The point is that it extracts exactly what is written in order to keep the process consistent (for more information about the keys of NELL access: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/)\nCurrently, some of the approaches applied on NELL to create an All-Pairs for Categories is: after the NE is found, two TP are extracted, one on the left of the NE and the other on the right of the NE. For example: \u201cLocated in USA, New York is a very famous city\u201d. For the NE \u201cNew York\u201d it will be extracted one TP on the left: \u201cLocated in USA,\u201d. And another on the right: \u201cis a very famous city\u201d. Five (5) grams are used to extract the TP in English.\nNE TP Occurrence Saint \u00c9tienne is a city 20 S\u00e3o Paulo is a city 30 New York is a city 50 Saint \u00c9tienne is a beautiful city 30 Saint \u00c9tienne city such as 30 S\u00e3o Paulo city such as 60 New York city such as 100\nCategories All-Pairs-Data\nNE NE TP Occurrence Saint \u00c9tienne France is located in 20 S\u00e3o Paulo Brazil is located in 20 New York USA is located in 40 Saint \u00c9tienne France is the most beautiful city in 20 Paris France is the capital of 30 Bras\u00edlia Brazil is the capital of 30\nRelations All-Pairs-Data\nTable 1 - Example of All-Pairs-Data for Categories\nTable 2 - Example of All-Pairs-Data for Relations\ncombinations between 2 or 3 and 5 grams are saved. For example: \u201cis a city\u201d, \u201cis a city located\u201d, \u201cis a city located near\u201d. For English a filter is used to find the better TP for a NE. In French and Portuguese, for Relations, the TP is the sentence between the NE pair. For categories, the number of grams is between 3 and 5. For English the number of grams is also until 5, but there are different filters to find the best TP. These filters have not been developed for other languages yet."}, {"heading": "4. NELL\u2019s Ontology", "text": "In order to start a new NELL instance, we need to give names of some Categories and Relations, examples of them and some configuration parameters to keep the structure of the ontology. For this we\u2019ve created spreadsheets which are then interpreted by script programs. The execution of the script creates the NELL initial Knowledge Base (KB) and this initial KB is used in the learning process in order to learn more (input and output of the NELL process)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Ontology Mapping", "text": "In order to create a new instance of NELL in a new language, we can create an ontology from scratch, or we can map the English one. Ontology Mapping is the process when the English spreadsheets are used to make a mapping for another language. We say \u201cmapping\u201d because it\u2019s not just a translation because categories names and relations names may have to be adapted for the new language. For example: State (original category in English, translated \u201cEtat\u201d in French) may have a different translation depending on the context.\nAll the columns of the spreadsheet have to be mapped. The most important points are 1) give the names of categories and relations in the new language and 2) give seeds for each predicate. Some examples of the spreadsheet columns for categories are: category name, seeds of instances (e.g.: for the category city the seeds can be: Paris, Saint-Etienne, Lyon, etc.), human format (e.g.: \u201cX is a city\u201d, where X is the learned city), mutex exceptions that define what categories are not mutual exclusive (e.g.: the category politician has the mutex exceptions: professor, astronaut, celebrity and so on), etc.\nFor the relation spreadsheet we have the almost the same columns of categories, but there is some additional information about the NE part. For\ndescribe the number of connections that the NE on the right of the relation can have with the NE on the left. In the same way there is the column \u201cnumber of inverse values\u201d for the NE on the left.\nSome examples for the spreadsheet of relation are: relation name, seeds of instances (e.g.: for the relation ceoOf, some seeds can be: \u201cSundar Pichai, Google\u201d, \u201cTim Cook, Apple\u201d, etc.), human format (e.g.: \u201cX is the ceo of Y\u201d, where X refers the instance of the category person and the Y refers the instance of a category company), mutex exceptions (e.g.: for buildingLocatedInCity the mutex exception is the relation aquariumInCity), and the columns \u201cnumber of values\u201d and \u201cnumber of inverse values\u201d (for the relation ceoOf the values are 1 and 1, because one company has just one ceo, and one ceo works just for one company."}, {"heading": "4.2 Human Supervision", "text": "After the new ontology is created, it can be used in the NELL process. Then it is possible to start the human supervision step.\nThe human supervision on the knowledge base is used to make NELL learning better and faster. The system learns every day and it needs to be supervised and corrected in order to learn rejecting wrong interpretations of text. The supervision task has some parameters (time/number of supervision) that can be changed with the evolution of the learning process."}, {"heading": "5. Challenges", "text": "We are developing the method to start new instances of NELL in various languages and develop then NELL\u2019s multilingualism. We base our method on our experience on NELL Portuguese and NELL French.\nA next step will be to work on the trans-lingual aspects of NELL. How to export the knowledge from English version for the other ones? The idea is that we can improve the knowledge base of all NELL versions if we share and exchange the knowledge from different languages. Such \u201cbridges\u201d between the knowledge bases would help the new ones to grow up faster and then to learn and improve faster. Reversely, text in other languages may indirectly enrich the English NELL which is not be able to find certain knowledge.\nAnother important perspective is to provide an easy way to map the NELL ontology with another knowledge base, for example DBPedia. BDPedia is\n(Semantic Web knowledge representation model). We work on applications that are able to generate RDF from NELL, or reversely to feed NELL from RDF knowledge bases. Other representation models can be used to represent knowledge. Our approach will facilitate the current and future interactions and integration efforts between NELL and other knowledge bases."}], "references": [{"title": "Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning", "author": ["A.
