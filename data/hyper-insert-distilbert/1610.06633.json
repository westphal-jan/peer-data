The amount of available information at our disposal clearly exceeds the search and consumption capacity of an individual. It creates two conflicting problems - an overabundance of choices but also a saturation of frequent yet not preferred content. In such situations, recommender systems play a crucial role in filtering suitable content for the user. However, recommender systems normally treat preferences as being fixed, an assumption profoundly violated in key recommender domains. Rather than fixed, a user\u2019s affinity towards content can change with consumption and time, repetitive or stale content leads to satiation, boredom or devaluation[15], and users are also intrinsically inclined to explore[14].\nAs a result, in the majority of the current recommender systems, after an initial period of satisfaction, users become increasingly bored of stale and repeated content that do not match their tastes. Dissatisfaction and distrust with the system are the consequence, because recommendations act similarly to advice \u2013 they are ignored or are greeted with hostility if the system\u2019s recommendations show a poor understanding of our tastes and cannot be trusted. Recommenders need to be more like a close aide who knows one\u2019s preferences well, whose\nsuggestions are sensitive to our current tastes and to changes in our preferences. For example, phrases like \u201cI am bored of my play list\u201d, are common in online music listening. Users start exploring on their own, indicating they have lost trust in the recommender system.\nFigure 1 illustrates the problem. Recommender systems generate suggestions by analyzing the collection of consumption histories. The longer users interact with the system, the more likely recommendations will be dominated by a few items that have been frequently consumed, collapsing diversity and novelty in the system. Because items typical devalue with repeated exposure, the system will increasingly generate undesirable recommendations over time. As a result, current systems face two main challenges - tracking the changes in user preferences, and the absence of historical information to recommend new items to a user in the system. Without understanding the current state of users\u2019 tastes, it is hard for computational systems to match recommendations to users\u2019 liking.\nIn psychology, changes in human preferences due to boredom or a desire for novelty are well known and characterized[9, 17, 23], but little has been done to incorporate them into recommender systems. Boredom and a desire for novelty have been demonstrated in music listening[15, 14], however, current systems do not have the means to understand or incorporate these latent preferences, largely due to the challenges of estimating\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n06 63\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.H C\n] 2\n1 O\nct 2\n01 6\nand tracking these cognitive constructs and in using them to improve user\u2019s experiences. This creates a fundamental question: how can recommender systems understand when a user is bored or seeking novelty? Another question is how do we determine which user to target for recommendation of new items that do not have any prior history. We answer these two fundamental questions.\nTo answer these questions on changing preferences with exposure and novel content, we introduce a novel, flexible and modular learning framework to represent user taste, track changes in user taste and learn the individualized policies matching user preferences, termed as Novelty Learning. We treat preferences as dynamically varying consumption bundles. Items are bundled together so that users prefer items in the bundle to recur in temporal proximity, but we allow the composition of these bundles to change over time. This model of preferences is novel, and we term it proximity filtering, because it relies solely on the consumption proximity between items in user\u2019s histories. We also find a set of latent musical tastes that are shared across users. We track their dynamic preferences in taste space, which allows us to recommend both novel items to users based on their current taste preferences, and recommend new tastes as the current taste becomes stale. The resulting system is best termed novelty learning via collaborative proximity filtering.\nThe goal of this paper is to introduce the novel concept of proximity filtering and demonstrate that this method can learn users\u2019 individualized novelty preferences in taste space. The remainder of this document presents this system in detail. Some of the common terms used are defined in table I. Section 2 provides background. In section 3 and 4, we discuss the presented model in details. The experimental set up is discussed in section 5, followed by discussion on results in the context in section 6. Finally, we conclude with a note on future scope."}, {"heading": "BACKGROUND", "text": "With most of the media being consumed in digital form now, online suppliers must target content to customer\u2019s preferences. Characterizing user preferences in domains like music that\nhave vast and diverse content poses significant challenges. The sheer diversity requires aggregating content using similarities.\nCurrent recommender systems are driven by inducing similarity: either between users [20], deriving recommendations from other users with the most similar consumption history; or similarity between items. For music recommendations there have been many attempts to exploit both user and item similarity to predict preferences. Oord et.al. [22] propose a latent factor model using weighted matrix factorization and deep convolutional neural networks. They show that recommendations using additional attributes are more sensible and useful when usage data is sparse. Fabian et.al.[2] evaluate tag based user profiles from social media in a personalization effort. Their work focuses on cross-system user modeling to improve recommendation quality. These methods are powerful, but as illustrated in the left panel of Figure 2, this induced similarity relies critically on static preferences, while users\u2019 preferential tastes are inherently more dynamic .\nMoore et.al.[18] analyze listening preferences of a population of users to try to track a hypothesized gradual change in group preferences over time, ignoring individual tastes. To personalize recommendations, Yin et.al.[24] explore social scenarios and study the influence of other users\u2019 choices and ratings on user interests. The rating mechanism, though explicit, is problematic because it is either a delayed reflection of user\u2019s state of mind when item was consumed or it can become influenced by other user\u2019s choices and public attention. This work also assumes that users\u2019 intrinsic interests do not vary much and that temporal dynamics comes from changes in public attention.\nIn domains like music, users\u2019 preferences clearly change individually with time and and should be treated as intrinsically dynamic. This means that all interest can be lost in items that were previously favorites (over-exposure breeds contempt[10] [12]). Users also have well-characterized desire for novel content [3], for which the recommender system will have little or no data. Rapid preference changes like these can catastrophically degrade the user\u2019s experience with the recommender system, unless it adapts and tracks these changes. Moreover, different users have different preferences dynamics, and our recommendations also should be adapted to their individualized appetites to explore new options.\nIn music listening, users have a natural preference dynamics that has previously been identified [15]. Preference for items increases with initial exposure, while boredom (item devaluation) sets in with subsequent exposures. Preferences tend to partially recover with time away from an item. Users recurrently consume a small, working set of items over days and weeks, slowly removing old songs and introducing new ones (essentially an evolving playlist). Viewing a window of listening history as a bundle of items co-consumed, we can say that listening preferences dynamically shift between consumption bundles of songs we term tastes. Similarity between songs is induced by being part of the same consumption bundle: similarity via temporal proximity. To better track changes in user\u2019s preferences, we exploit this recurrent structure in music listening, using song proximity to filter collaborative and novel recommendations to users (see Figure 2, right panel)."}, {"heading": "PROXIMITY FILTERING BY TASTES DISCOVERY", "text": "Users consume media items like songs in temporal proximity of consumption bundles and not in isolation. These consumption bundles are meaningful in understanding user\u2019s preferences at an abstract level. The items within the same consumption bundle are likely to be similar in user\u2019s tastes and they are likely to be co-preferred because of the proximity in the consumption bundles as illustrated in Figure 3. It forms the basis of our intuition of proximity filtering.\nWe introduce a novel computational proximity filtering model that considers user tastes as latent structure over dynamic consumption bundles. To discover the underlying common pool of users\u2019 tastes, we adapt topic discovery models used in text analysis to discover the equivalent musical topics from listening histories. Topic modeling methods discover useful themes from word co-occurrence frequencies within documents, by\nanalyzing a large text corpus. We adapt Latent Dirichlet Allocation [4], a powerful topic modeling technique through an analogy between the set of music listening histories and a text corpus. Figure 4 illustrates this analogy between tastes discovery and a document topic model. Documents correspond to contiguous sections of listening history from a user. The tastes correspond to latent topics in a standard topic model. All the users share the same set of discovered tastes but each user has a probabilistic distribution over these latent tastes. User preferences are dynamic, therefore, we represent a user\u2019s dynamic preference state as a time-varying mixture of latent tastes. User behavior in content consumption domain is a manifestation of these dynamic preferences.\nThe discovered taste themes are not predefined but inherently data driven and provide a meaningful and interpretable representation of users\u2019 liking. In natural language processing, language modelling methods learn relationships between language constructs. Since our aim is to uncover latent themes to understand user behaviors and liking, topic modeling is an appropriate and preferred method.\nMore specifically, our tastes model maps into a topic model as illustrated in Figure 5. Each user Um consumes content sm,n and we can represent the observed content as derived from latent tastes. Each of the user tastes is one among the common pool of the discovered tastes and derived from a taste proportion. Figure 4 illustrates a matrix form with each cell representing the probability of a song in user\u2019s taste proportion\nand the taste, in turn, is derived from the discovered common pool of latent tastes. Similar to [4], each cell in this matrix represents\nP(sm,n|zm,n,\u03b11:K) = \u03b1zm,n,sm,n (1) Discovered tastes as well as taste proportions for users are assumed to come from a Dirichlet. Therefore, the model is reduced to finding a joint distribution similar to [4]\nP(\u03b11:K ,\u03b21:M,z1:M,s1:M) = \u03a0Ki=1P(\u03b1i)\u03a0 M m=1P(\u03b2m)\n(\u03a0Nn=1P(zm,n|\u03b2m)P(sm,n|zm,n,\u03b11:K)) (2) Until recently, users were largely profiled using static attributes like gender, location etc., but such static attributes are not of much value [1]. We uncover user attributes by understanding the distinctive mixture of their latent tastes as well as the similarities in a common taste pool. This interpretation lies at the core of taste space transformation to learn inherent user preferences and novelty seeking behaviors.\nOur model consists of modular building blocks providing flexibility, re-usability and extensibility to a range of content delivery domains. We present the schematic diagram of the framework in Figure 6. In the taste discovery, we obtain tastes distribution for users and tracks distribution for tastes. The tracks distribution for tastes demonstrate that different tastes vary in proportions of tracks. As we observe, the tastes have differentiating proportions of a set of tracks and these proportional compositions characterize the discovered tastes. While the discovered tastes are shared across users, users have a distinctive proportional mixture of latent tastes. This representation allows us to transform users\u2019 itemized consumption into latent taste space using the discovered tastes pool and learn users\u2019 novelty seeking behaviors. In a nutshell, the discovered latent tastes are leveraged to learn user preferences and we demonstrate our method for users\u2019 online music listening."}, {"heading": "NOVELTY LEARNING", "text": "In Psychology, boredom is often considered as an emotion of dullness or lacking stimulation. Goetz et.al. [11] describe and support the external validity of boredom with varying degrees of arousal and valence. However, due to its hidden presentation in perceived environment, it is hard to track boredom using explicitly observable signals like ratings of items, satisfaction scores etc. In an academic setting, Nett et al. [19] explored different strategies with groups of individuals to find out their activities in boredom situations. In absence of any visual or observable cue about user\u2019s emotional state, recommender systems fail to understand whether a user is novelty seeking or not and users, in absence of content matching their taste, get bored sooner than later.\nFigure 7 illustrates devaluation of user preferences as user receives recommendations. In the beginning, users might have a stronger liking to the recommended items, however, as the cycle of repetitive or stale recommendations continues, users get bored and stop trusting the system leading to either user churn or disengagement. Boredom increases with repeated exposure. Since boredom does not manifest itself as visibly as other emotional states like anger or excitement but a more silent one, novelty seeking users might not even provide a\nfeedback or any directly observable signal. It makes current recommender systems completely clueless to understand users\u2019 tastes. Once a user is disengaged, it is an uphill task for the systems to earn user\u2019s trust back. Therefore, we need a machinery to understand user behaviors more proactively and we aim to bridge this fundamental gap by providing a method to learn novelty seeking behavior using latent tastes."}, {"heading": "Taste Membership", "text": "Users consume contents at items level like songs but their implicit behaviors and preferences can not be understood in item level view but an abstract view. The items are consumed in bundles which reflect users\u2019 affinity to a taste. Such a representation is useful in understanding implicit constructs that drive preferences.Therefore, we use the discovered tastes pool to associate each of the item bundles with a taste and transform temporal sequences of users\u2019 consumed items bundles into an abstracted taste space. Figure 8 illustrates the method. We\ncompute taste association i.e. a taste to be assigned to a temporal window. Let si represent song or track id, k, tastes and h be the history of tracks listened in a time period of length n given by [s1,s2, ...sn]. For every temporal window, we compute the probability that a taste is associated with it and for a history h, it is given by\nP(k|h) = \u03a0ni=1P(si|k)P(k)/\u03a3ni=1P(si|k)P(k) (3)\nwhere P(k) = user taste probability and P(si|k) = taste track probability This evaluated probability is used to assign a taste to each temporal window i.e. session as\nTasteassigned = maxkP(k|h) (4)\nConsequently, users\u2019 items consumption space is transformed into a latent taste space and we can now learn users\u2019 preferences."}, {"heading": "Novelty Policy Q-Learning", "text": "Learning users\u2019 behaviors like novelty seeking is crucial but ignored aspect in not only recommender systems but also human factors and engagement initiatives. An implicit nature of boredom manifestation also introduces difficulty in computational tracking of user behavior. To answer this problem, we aim to learn the users\u2019 novelty seeking policies. Since item level consumption view does not present insights abstract enough to learn behaviors, we need to resort to a taste space representation. Users tastes are dynamic and we present changing tastes as novelty seeking behavior, it also represents boredom with content. When users continue to consume items without a change in their tastes, they are content with the familiarity. Our novelty learning agent, a model free reinforcement learning agent, learns users\u2019 novelty seeking policies.\nReinforcement learning [21] has its roots in psychology and animals\u2019 reward seeking behavior. The goal is to maximize the utility by taking a set of actions in an environment state and learn the policy that maximizes the utility. The environment is typically conceptualized as a Markov Decision Process. The reinforcement learning methods differ from classic supervised learning in a way that we do not know the correct input and output pairs nor there is any attempt to make an explicit correction. Rather, the models are based on experiencing the reward and exploitation-exploration trade-offs to find out the optimal or maximizing utility. Such level of unknown input-output pairs make it suitable to our learning problem. We use a model free reinforcement learning method called Q-learning [13] in which we do not need to know any transition probability model\nbeforehand. With Q-learning, for each of the users, we learn state-action mapping that gives the expected utility of taking an action in a given state and in turn, it gives us an optimal policy. Cohen et.al. [6] show that the exploratory preferences depend on user\u2019s state. We learn behaviors from users\u2019 taste states. In an episode, an action is taken, a reward is realized and an update to Q values is made. The magnitude of update depends on the learning rate and discount factor. We consider the state, s, at time t as user\u2019s tastes representation at time t. As illustrated in Figure 9, our policy learning agent learns an optimal policy in a taste state, s, with actions a, novelty seeking or content with familiarity, taking the user to a new state, s\u2032 and it receives a reward. The cumulative reward is maximized, thereby, we learn an optimal policy which is a mapping of preferences with state as illustrated in the update equation below:\nQ(s,a) := Q(s,a)+\u03b1[r+ \u03b3 max a\u2032\nQ(s\u2032,a\u2032)\u2212Q(s,a)] (5)\nwhere \u03b1 is learning rate and \u03b3 discount factor. Learning rate determines to what extent the values will be updated and discount factor determines the importance of future rewards. We set \u03b1 as a decaying function of iterations, \u03b3 as 0.9 and reward values are empirically set for users. Once the Q-learning converges, we get an optimal policy in a state, \u03c0\u2217(s), given by\n\u03c0\u2217(s) = argmax a Q\u2217(s,a) (6)\nand this learned policy reflects users\u2019 novelty seeking behaviors. Finally, our presented model learns a crucial but hard to learn implicit user preferences like boredom or novelty seeking. Due to its flexible and modular design, the presented novelty learning method could play a significant role in making systems perceptive and trust worthy in a longer term."}, {"heading": "Evaluation Metrics", "text": "Our measurement metrics are F1Score, Accuracy and Value of Personalization, as defined below:"}, {"heading": "F1Score and Accuracy", "text": "Given that t p is true positive, tn true negative, f p false positive and f n false negative, we can define F1Score and Accuracy as\nP = t p/(t p+ f p);R = t p/(t p+ f n) (7) F1Score = (2PR)/(P+R) (8)\nAccuracy = (t p+ tn)/(t p+ tn+ f p+ f n) (9)"}, {"heading": "Value of Personalization", "text": "User behaviors are individualistic and intrinsic which makes personalization of great value.

Last.fm is a popular music listening service helping users explore a variety of music, learn new music, connect with community and revisit previously listened tracks. Since this dataset has a temporal data, it forms a natural choice for our experiment requiring consumption diversity. Dataset [16] consists of complete music listening history of around 1K users from 2005 till 2009 with user id, time stamp, artist id, artist name, track id and track name for every user. The dataset statistics is provided in table 2. Algorithm 1 presents the key steps involved.\nAlgorithm 1 Proximity Filtering and Novelty Learning Parameters: K number of discovered tastes, w temporal window size, r reward values x\u2190 Input bag-of-words format {pre-processing} \u03b1,\u03b2 = LDA(x) {get User Tastes and Taste Tracks dist.} Xm,t,s = Input content consumption in temporal windows {pre-processing} Xm,t = Associate Taste Membership for j = 1 : M do {for each user} Training\nInitialize RL Parameters while not converged do\nselect action a with \u03b5-greedy policy from Q take action a s\u2019, r\u2190 new state, reward make Q-update {Novelty Policy Q-Learning} s\u2190 s\u2019\nreturn policy Evaluate Evaluate on held out set\nIn pre-processing and sessions management phases, we convert users\u2019 music listening data from a naive format to time series as well as bag-of-words format as required to discover tastes pool. An off-the-shelf package [7] is used for topic modeling. To assess a reasonable set of model parameters with stability, we computed the perplexity of the held out user set. The held-out set was unseen by the model during training. For a trained model, the perplexity of the unseen set is given by:\nPerplexity(Utest) = exp{\u2212\u03a3mi=1log(p(ui|model))/\u03a3mi=1Ni} (11) where log(p(ui|model)) is the log likelihood, calculated by fitting the trained model to the held-out set. We varied number of topics from 1 to 40 and number of iterations for convergence as 10,100,1000 and 10000. We observed that the perplexity becomes stable beyond the number of iterations for convergence set as 100 iterations. We chose the number of topics to 20 which is at the beginning of a flat perplexity region and iterations as 1K because there is no gain in perplexity beyond these values. Moreover, we set up the temporal session window size to one hour empirically. We varied it from 30 minutes - 1 week respectively. A larger window size does not reflect users\u2019 \u2018in-moment\u2019 taste because users listen to tracks in proximity depending upon their current mood or state of mind. Using these parameters, we discover tastes to get tastes distribution per user and tracks distribution per taste and associate each of the temporal sessions with a taste. Therefore, users\u2019 items consumption history is transformed into a taste space.\nThe taste space representation is at an abstract level and we use it to learn novelty seeking Q-learning policy. Reinforcement learning requires learning rate and discount rate which are set as 1/(t0.65) and 0.9 respectively following several insights on convergence [8]. For experimental simulation, the reward values are set in a range from -1 to 1 as well as a small action cost. The Q-learning iterates until convergence and learns an optimal policy, whether a user is going to be novelty seeking or not given the current taste state of that user. We validate\nthe learned policy using 80-20 training-validation split. Since the users\u2019 music listening data is in a time series format, this 80-20 split up is suitable when compared to other cross validation methods. We evaluate F1Score, Accuracy and Value of Personalization for every user.\nIn a supporting experiment to demonstrate users\u2019 quitting behavior and how taste representation can be beneficial, we use taste distribution per user from tastes discovery and create users\u2019 taste profiles. This is similar to the previous experiment except that instead of associating a taste, we associate a taste profile. Our aim, now, is to gain some insights into users\u2019 listening patterns with their taste profile similarities with previous sessions. Using this similarity score, we demonstrate that learning novelty in latent taste space is insightful in understanding users\u2019 content consumption behavior and knowing the potential customers who can quit.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no other computational method to learn inherent user tastes and dynamic behaviors like boredom or novelty seeking which are not directly observable. Therefore, a direct comparison with any method would be incomprehensible. However, to check our model, we compare our policy learning measures with that of Support Vector Machine with rbf kernel. Finally, we evaluate the value of personalization quantitatively."}, {"heading": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "We evaluated our model on the last.fm music listening dataset. We discuss user churn followed by novelty learning."}, {"heading": "User Quit and Novelty Seeking Behavior in Taste Space", "text": "User churn is a major concern in a number of domains. Proactive knowledge of users who seek novelty is an important step to keep their trust in the recommender systems. We look at users\u2019 quitting behavior with respect to their taste profile sequences. We compute an average taste profile similarity score by comparing users\u2019 taste profile in the current session with that in the previous session. This measure is used to demonstrate our taste model\u2019s ability to learn user behavior using two example users - one who quit and stopped using the services within 449 days and other who continued to consume music listening services. Figure 10a demonstrates that the average number of tracks listened in a month by the \u2018quitting\u2019 user continued to decline and the system was unable to act on this behavior because it had no clue if the user is seeking novelty or not. As shown in Figure 10b, the average profile similarity for this \u2018quitting\u2019 user is lower with \u00b5 = 0.51 and \u03c3 = 0.15 compared to the \u2018continuing\u2019 user with \u00b5 = 0.89 and \u03c3 = 0.11. It demonstrates that our novelty learning method in taste space could play a pivotal role in understanding user behaviors proactively.\nWe also sought to understand an approximate user quiting behavior at a subgroup level. To achieve that, users were categorized based on their activities time period. We considered quitting users as the users whose activity time period from their first recorded activity to the last recorded activity was less than a year and their last recorded activity was at least one year prior to the end of the dataset time period. This ensured that we do not incorrectly categorize the users who started\nIndividual Music Listening Pattern\nusing the service very late. Similar to the individual user behavior analysis, we computed the taste similarity scores of users but at an aggregate level and demonstrate the subgroup level measures in Figure 10c.

However, spontaneous changes in user preferences are ubiquitous in many domains like media consumption and key factors that drive changes in preferences are not directly observable. These latent sources of preference change pose new challenges. When systems do not track and adapt to users\u2019 tastes, users lose confidence and trust, increasing the risk of user churn. We meet these challenges by developing a model of novelty preferences that learns and tracks latent user tastes. We combine three innovations: a new measure of item similarity based on patterns of consumption co-occurrence; model for spontaneous changes in preferences; and a learning agent that tracks each user\u2019s dynamic preferences and learns individualized policies for variety. The resulting framework adaptively provides users with novelty tailored to their preferences for change per se. Author", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
