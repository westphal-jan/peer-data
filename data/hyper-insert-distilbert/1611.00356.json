But certain categories are typically excluded, whether because of national security or personal privacy. Distinguishing between what citizens are entitled to know and what officials are obliged to withhold is therefore a growing challenge, one that is compounded by the rapid growth in the volume of government records. In the U.S. and other countries records managers and archivists are struggling to cope, especially because electronic records like e-mail require new methods for processing and preservation (Moss 2012). This quantitative growth and qualitative transformation poses profound questions about the nature of democratic accountability in the age of \u201cbig data.\u201d As the conditions for research in historical records change, it will require rethinking how we study international relations (Allen and Connelly 2016).\nThe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request that revealed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server has put these challenges in stark relief. The FBI concluded that Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in overlooking sensitive information and failing to preserve public records (Comey 2016). Clinton\u2019s defenders argue that what is classified is \u201calmost random,\u201d and that her practices were not unlike those of her predecessors (Lowell 2016). Both sides agree that it took too long to review (and redact) the 54,000 pages of e-mail she turned over to authorities, only for the FBI to re-open the inquiry ten days before the election when additional e-mail emerged. In response to another FOIA request for the e-mail of three of Clinton\u2019s top aides, which amounted to 450,000 pages, the State Department estimated that it would take seventy-five years to review all the material (LoBianco 2016). But this is just the tip of the iceberg. It is thought that the State Department generates two billion e-mail every single\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nyear (McAllister 2010) .\nCurrent declassification methods are clearly inadequate to cope with the volume of potentially sensitive information that is now being generated (Public Interest Declassification Board 2012). But it is likely that many of these e-mail along with other electronic records will be lost before anyone has a chance to review them. The Office of the Inspector General found that the e-mail of many senior officials from just a few years ago may never be recovered because of lost passwords or corrupted files (State Department OIG 2016).\nWhat can we reasonably expect from government officials charged with protecting sensitive information, and is it possible to develop systems that might help officials manage both classification and declassification more rapidly and more reliably? To date, there has been virtually no government investment in research that might answer these questions. The U.S. spent over $16 billion in 2015 to protect classified information. Just the increase in spending on secrecy over the last two years -- $4.5 billion -- is nearly ten times more than the government spends on administering the Freedom of Information Act (Department of Justice 2015), and more than ten times as much as the entire budget of the U.S. National Archives (ISOO 2015). But we have yet to see a single controlled experiment to determine to what extent officials agree on what information should be classified.\nTheorists have long speculated as to the reasons why even democratic regimes invest so much more in secrecy than transparency. Excessive secrecy, or \u201coverclassification,\u201d has long been recognized as contrary to the ostensible purpose of protecting sensitive information. It dilutes the meaning of classification and undermines respect for security procedures (Commission on\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nProtecting and Reducing Government Secrecy 1997). In recent years, the persistence of high levels of secrecy -- notwithstanding the Obama administration\u2019s pledge to be the most transparent in history -- has renewed interest in whether a preference for concealment is intrinsic to bureaucracy (Sagar 2013, Pozen 2010). As Max Weber famously argued:\nThis superiority of the professional insider every bureaucracy seeks further to\nincrease through the means of keeping secret its knowledge and intentions.\nBureaucratic administration always tends to exclude the public, to hide its knowledge and action from criticism as well as it can. (Weber 1922)\nIn his classic history of official secrecy in Britain, David Vincent points out that Weber was really\ndescribing ideal types. Historical research reveals that not every bureaucracy has sought to\nmaximize secrecy, and the amount of secrecy within the same bureaucracy can ebb and flow over time. (Vincent 1999) In 1997, during a period of relatively greater transparency in U.S. foreign policy following the end of the Cold War, the landmark report of the Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy also drew on historical research in concluding that secrecy is best seen as a form of regulation (Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy 1997). The problem since the very founding of the Republic is that, unlike other forms of regulation, there is no effective mechanism for determining whether the Executive is managing secrecy appropriately (Hoffman 1981; Sagar 2013).\nA key challenge is therefore in determining what kinds of information really do require safekeeping, especially since the evidence from the past is largely anecdotal. Developing a richer, more robust theory of official secrecy that can both account for variation in classification\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\npractices and inform more effective regulation requires empirical research. As Vincent acknowledges, while qualitative research in archives can reveal how officials keep secrets, it is less suited to revealing the larger patterns in what kinds of information they typically conceal. Computational analysis of declassified records can identify both patterns and anomalies, and show whether practices are consistent enough as to become predictable. This is both a good test of theory and the essential precondition for any technology that would assist in the management of sensitive information. When it comes to the Clinton e-mail, such methods can show what is normal and what might be considered negligent in how officials manage large numbers of potentially sensitive communications.\nThe release of the first generation of U.S. government electronic records presents new opportunities to analyze this problem using well-developed methods from natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning. We report on the performance of algorithms developed to automatically identify sensitive information. We trained and tested these algorithms using some one million diplomatic cables from the 1970s that were originally marked as \u201csecret,\u201d \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201climited official use,\u201d or \u201cunclassified.\u201d Cables were the main form of secure communications in this period, and since the original metadata include not only the classification level, but also the sender, recipient, date, and subject, these cables -- and research analyzing these cables -- are quite relevant to management challenges for newer types of communications, notably e-mail. They can show whether classification has historically been random or predictable, and analyzing the errors machines make in identifying sensitive information can help us understand the errors that humans make.\nThis article begins with a discussion of the materials and methods used in the experiment. We\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nthen identify the features most characteristic of classified communications. We analyze how different theories of official secrecy can help explain the data, and how computational methods yield new insights. We then present the results obtained when we apply these insights to different classification tasks, depending on whether we define secrecy more or less broadly. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings both in terms of the recent Clinton e-mail controversy and future prospects for technology that could better manage both classification and declassification."}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods:", "text": "Our task was to use features from the metadata and the message text to predict whether a given document would be classified or unclassified. In essence, we take a set of observations in which the category membership is known to create a training set. We then use this data to train a statistical model that scores the probability of new observations taken from a random sample to belong to the same category. Ironically, in data science this is known as a classification task.\nWe obtained our data from the Central Foreign Policy Files (CFPF) of the U.S. State Department, which are available from the U.S. National Archives in the form of XML files on DVDs. The CFPF was also the source of the classified diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks in 2010-11. But the best available estimate is that the 251,000 Wikileaks cables constitute only 5-6% of all the cables produced in 2005-10 (Gill and Spirling, 2015). Even that estimate requires assuming that the release constituted a random sample. But it seems unlikely that a random sample of U.S. diplomatic cables would feature more mentions of the Wrangel Islands than Russia.\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nThere are also gaps in the declassified documents from the 1970s, and neither corpus includes the relatively few documents classified as \u201cTop Secret.\u201d But the great advantage of using declassified historical data is that we can analyze the lacunae using both the appraisal records of archivists and the metadata that is available even for corrupted or still-classified records.\nThe National Archives appraisal of the electronic records of the CFPF shows how archivists and records managers endeavored to preserve all historically significant records among the 27 million that had accumulated by 2006. This corpus was both quantitatively and qualitatively different from the paper records archivists were accustomed to dealing with. They analyzed it by utilizing the 188 subject \u201cTAGS\u201d the original State Department drafters had assigned to each record since the system was created in 1973. This metadata field, which also included TAGS for each country, was intended to facilitate \u201cTraffic Analysis by Geography and Subject.\u201d Archivists used it to identify and preserve all records from the 93 subject TAGS belonging to the broad categories of Political Affairs, Military Affairs, Social Affairs, Economic Affairs, Technology and Science. For the 95 other subject TAGS on things like Operations, Administration, and Consular Affairs, they reviewed a sample that totalled over seven thousand cables to decide which TAGS merited preservation even if the cables were not cross-referenced with other, more obviously significant subject TAGS.\nThe CFPF is therefore a curated corpus, but the effect of prioritizing the preservation of historically significant records was to reduce the relative proportion that was unclassified. Of the top forty TAGS ranked by the relative number of cables classified \u201csecret,\u201d only one was from the Operations, Administration, or Consular Affairs categories, and that was for the\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nAdministration of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research (AINR.) Even these records, which archivists decided to retain, were relatively mundane -- travel reservations and the like. The largest groups of cables that archivists decided not to preserve were those related to Visas, Personnel, and Financial Management (Langbart 2007).\nIn training the algorithms to identify classified communications, we also had to exclude non-cable records that did not include the message text in digital form, such as paper records, many of which were delivered via diplomatic pouch (\u201cp-reel\u201d records). In addition, there are 410,539 \u201cwithdrawn\u201d cables where only the metadata has been declassified. We also had to exclude cables that had no text or just \u201cn/a\u201d for the features we used in building the classifier (see Table 5, and see also the Supplementary Information).\nThe available metadata shows that about the same percentage of the withdrawn cables were originally classified as secret as compared to the cables that were released (5.2% versus 5.3%). The reason is that many records are withheld because they contain personally identifiable information and not national security information. Even fewer P-reel documents were originally classified secret (2.6%). Conversely, when we identified features in the metadata characteristic of the most secret communications, we found little difference in the rankings whether or not we included metadata from the withdrawn cables, and whether these communications were cables or p-reel records.\nBut there is one category of missing data that is quite distinct in terms of secrecy: 128,026 cables were meant to be preserved because they have TAGS deemed to be historically significant, but there is no message text for these cables in the State Department Automated\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nData System -- only metadata. According to the U.S. National Archives, the State Department lost some of the data during migration between different hardware and software platforms, but \u201csome telegrams were intentionally deleted from the electronic repository.\u201d (National Archives and Records Administration 2016). There are intriguing patterns in the missing data, to be discussed below.\nFor purposes of the experiment, the main problem with incomplete data is that it increases the difficulty of developing algorithms to automatically identify classified communications. But since we still have the metadata even for these withdrawn and incomplete records, we can use them to begin analyzing what kinds of information is typically classified. We will do that by identifying the features in the metadata that are most useful in predicting which cables are secret, such as who sent or received the cable, what topic it concerned, and what keywords the authors used to categorize it. We then compute which embassies, topics, and keywords had the highest proportion of secret cables.\nIn preparing the remaining 981,083 cables for the machine classification experiment, we carried out many standard NLP operations to process the raw textual data, starting with tokenization. Compound names of places in textual fields were aggregated, enabling them to be treated as a single token (i. e. NEW YORK was transformed to NEWYORK). This step was especially\nimportant in the case of the from and to fields, which represent the names of the embassies.\nThese fields were aggregated in a new field, sender/recipient , for the vectorization process. We\nalso eliminated all the trailing punctuation and words with length of 1. While underscores and hyphens in the middle of words were maintained, hyphenation was otherwise eliminated from textual fields. So too were stopwords using the NLTK (Bird 2009) English stopwords list.\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nSome of the available metadata indicated how these records were reviewed before release. But to test the feasibility of a system to recommend the appropriate classification under real world conditions, we only used data that would be available to a human -- or a computer -- before a\ncable is sent. In addition to the message text (the body field), we found the following features\nmost useful in distinguishing more classified cables from the rest of the corpus: 1)\nsender/recipient , a combination of the \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d fields, which typically is an embassy or\noffice; 2) concepts, standard keywords used to categorize each document; 3) subjec t, a short description; 4) office , the part of the State Department with responsibility for either originating or\nacting on a cable; 5) TAGS , for Traffic Analysis by Geography and Subject.\nFor each one of the features, and many feature combinations, we applied different forms of vectorization and tested the prediction power of the resulting vectors using several types of classifiers and ensembles. Most machine learning algorithms require fixed length vectors as inputs. For bodies of text, vectorization steps were performed using a Bag of Words (BoW) (Harris 1954) approach, using plain term counts or some form of weighting such as TfIdf (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, Sp\u00e4rck 1972).\nAll these vector transformations have parameters: the size of the vocabulary; the n-gram range taken in consideration (single tokens are unigrams; two consecutive tokens are bigrams, etc.); the choice of whether to eliminate stopwords; the minimum and maximum document frequencies; among others specific to each feature. We undertook extensive tests and hyperparameter optimization (Bergstra 2012) to determine the best parameters (Table S.4).\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nFor this corpus TfIdf did not perform better than plain term frequencies in the BoW vectors.\nDespite having bigger vocabulary sizes, the fields subject , concepts, and body have been\nrepresented using a vocabulary that only considers the top N words ordered by term frequency\nacross the corpus. For the TAGS and Office fields, all distinct tokens that appeared in more than\nfive cables were taken into account. For the new field sender/recipient, we have discarded those\nthat appeared in fewer than six cables, which can be indicative of misspellings.\nWe have used cross validation to test the performance of different models and avoid over-fitting, i.e. choosing a model that would perform poorly on data outside the sample. This entailed setting aside a random selection of cables and -- after training our classifier with the rest of the data -- testing the accuracy of its predictions for the randomly selected cables. We used the stratified k-fold method, maintaining the proportion of classes ( \u201cunclassified,\u201d \u201climited official use,\u201d \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201csecret\u201d) in each fold. The k-fold itself uses k folds for training and test sets. We have chosen three folds for each classifier, trained with the training set and evaluated with the test set.\nRather than using just one classifier for this task, we tested twelve different classification models to evaluate their overall performance in terms of the AUC\\ROC metric (Hanley 1982, Davis 2006, and see SI). Based on these tests, we built an ensemble of the seven best-performing algorithms using different weights for each: Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, Ridge, Bagging, Extremely Randomized Trees, AdaBoost and Multinomial Naive Bayes. This can be likened to assembling experts and giving them more or less weight depending on their comparative reliability.\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nUpon determining that using all features as independent vectors produced the best results, we applied this method to four different tasks: (U)nclassified vs (L)imited Official Use, (C)onfidential, and (S)ecret; U, L vs C, S; U, L, C vs S; and U vs C,S (Table 4). One could make further adjustments to the parameters, but we do not believe they would bring more than marginal gains, and the generalizability of the model would be compromised. Instead, we believe that this model could be used with similar kinds of data to achieve similar results, such as future releases from the same Central Foreign Policy Files."}, {"heading": "What Makes Secret Cables Different?", "text": "The scale and multi-dimensional nature of data from formerly classified diplomatic communications illustrates the need to use machine-learning methods to identify patterns and anomalies for otherwise hard-to-observe phenomena (Monroe et al. 2015). In this experiment, there were 40,700 possible features for each of the 918,083 records (Table S4). This much data precludes a purely qualitative analysis. Instead, it rewards an approach that allows for multiple combinations of variables and differently weighting each variable depending on the task at hand. And once we determine the features that are most useful in identifying classified records, we can look more closely at each one to indicate the kind of patterns that combine to create accurate predictions. 1\nOne feature we did not find to be useful in predicting whether a record was more or less likely to\nbe classified was the month and year it was dispatched. This is partly because it is difficult to\n1 This part of the analysis is limited to cables grouped by origin/destination, TAGS, and concepts, since other useful fields -- like Office, and the words in the message -- were not available for records that were withdrawn or where the message text is missing.\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\ndivide up the data temporally, since patterns of activity change with weekends and holidays, and some units -- like months -- are of variable length. But it\u2019s also because there was no clear trend or pattern in the proportion of classified diplomatic communications. The overall level of secrecy was little changed during the first two years of the Carter administration as compared to the time that Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State. (See Fig. 1) This is surprising, considering how the context of diplomacy in the period 1973-78 was becoming increasingly hostile to official secrecy, after the revelations of the secret bombing of Cambodia, Watergate, and the Church Committee hearings on covert CIA operations. Shortly after assuming office in 1977, Jimmy Carter famously rejected Kissinger\u2019s penchant for secrecy, promising \u201ca foreign policy that the American people both support and, for a change, know about and understand.\u201d Echoing Woodrow Wilson, he insisted that \u201cOur policy must shape an international system that will last longer than secret deals. We cannot make this kind of policy by manipulation. Our policy must be open; it must be candid\u2026\u201d (Carter 1977)\nIn fact, over the period 1973-78 communications regarding the same kinds of subjects continued to be classified: military matters and international negotiations. The posts that transmitted the highest percentage of secret cables include officials negotiating the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties and the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction agreements, those reporting from or to military staff headquarters, and those working at two embassies -- Cairo and Tel Aviv -- that were a focus of U.S. diplomacy leading up to the Camp David Accords (see Table 1).\nUntil recently, even the strongest proponents of transparency conceded that diplomacy must sometimes be conducted in secret, particularly when it comes to the use of force and statecraft.\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nWoodrow Wilson himself conducted the negotiations for the Versailles Treaty behind closed doors even after promising \u201copen covenants of peace, openly arrived at\u201d in his famous Fourteen Points. (Nicholson 1964) As Fran\u00e7ois de Calli\u00e8res noted three centuries ago in a classic guide to diplomatic practice, secrecy is \u201cthe life of negotiations.\u201d (De Calli\u00e8res 1716) Even before the founding of the United States, the Continental Congress deemed the dispatches of the first American diplomats to be secret by default. The Constitutional Convention -- itself conducted in secret -- sought a strong executive who could act with secrecy and dispatch. (Hoffman 1981) Jeremy Bentham argued that transparency made government more efficacious, but agreed it should be \u201csuspended\u201d if it were calculated \u201cTo favour the projects of an enemy.\u201d (Bentham 1843) While railing against the \u201cgrowing evil\u201d of official secrecy, Giuseppe Mazzini conceded it was necessary to \u201cLet diplomacy have its secrets, for diplomacy is but a refined mode of modern warfare...\u201d (Mazzini 1844) Diplomats have defended secrecy by arguing that\nconfidential negotiations are an alternative  to warfare, and far preferable (Nicholson 1964).\nThe same pattern of protecting records related to international negotiations and military operations is evident in an analysis of the 862 Concepts, or keywords, State Department officials used to organize diplomatic cables (see Table 2). But so too is the tendency -- already evident in cables sent to the White House -- for the most senior officials to pursue special protection for their own communications. Ironically, the already notorious problem of overclassification made this more difficult. It was not just outside critics like Jimmy Carter who complained about the problem of excessive secrecy. Richard Nixon expressed frustration at the way even categories like \u201ctop secret\u201d had become so overused as to lose real value or meaning. He favored creating a new designation indicative of an even higher level of exclusivity (Blanton 2003)\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nIn 1974 the State Department created special designations for communications involving the most senior officials. Cables with the \u201cCAT-C,\u201d \u201cCAT-B,\u201d and \u201cCAT-A\u201d concepts continued to be highly classified during the Carter administration. Conversely, Concepts associated with few or no secret cables (<1%) are indicative of the kinds of subjects -- like \u201cmusic\u201d and \u201cmeats\u201d -- that senior officials considered less important or less urgent (see Table 3).\nThere is also evidence that certain records were removed from the State Department Automated Data System. According to the National Archives, many of the cables where we have complete metadata but no message text are available on microfilm. Moreover, we do not know when the data were migrated, and the electronic versions of messages were lost. But it\u2019s notable that most of these cables do not date to when the State Department first set up the system, when one might expect it would have been troubleshooting ways to reliably transfer data between different hardware and software platforms. Instead, most date to 1975-76, and coincide with some of Henry Kissinger\u2019s most controversial actions at a time in which he was coming under increasing criticism for his conduct as Secretary of State.\nIntriguingly, the cables missing from the database also tend to be more highly classified, and often involve the most senior officials. Electronic messages classified as \u201cSecret\u201d were more than three times more likely to go missing compared to Unclassified and Limited Official Use messages (22% versus 6.5%). As for the CAT-C cables, we only have the electronic message text for 38%. For the rest, there is only an error message, e.g.:\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nMRN: 1975JAKART014946 SEGMENT NUMBER: 000001 EXPAND ERROR ENCOUNTERED; TELEGRAM TEXT FOR THIS SEGMENT IS UNAVAILABLE\nThis particular record, an account of a meeting in Jakarta between Gerald Ford, Henry Kissinger, and Indonesian president Suharto, survived and was printed out in hard copy. But there are almost no State Department cables in the database from December 1-15, 1975, the first of several conspicuous gaps. When the cable was finally declassified in full in 2001, after the fall of the Suharto regime, it showed that Ford gave a green light to Suharto\u2019s stated plan to conquer East Timor using U.S. arms. Realizing this would be in violation of American law, Kissinger advised Suharto to construe it as self-defense and delay the operation until Ford had returned home. But, he said, it was particularly important that \u201cwhatever you do succeeds quickly.\u201d (Jakarta to State 1975)\nKissinger was incensed when, later that month, a U.S. foreign service officer sent a cable that apparently confirmed this violation of U.S. law. Kissinger worried about how many people had already seen it. \u201cThat will leak in three months and it will come out that Kissinger overruled his pristine bureaucrats and violated the law\u2026.Everything on paper will be used against me.\u201d (Memorandum of Conversation 1975) This second cable is one of the 119 cables sent from Jakarta that same month which are now missing from the database.\nOther notable gaps in the electronic record include March 18-31 1976, when Kissinger supported the military coup in Argentina; May 25-31 1976, when he favored the Syrian invasion of Lebanon; and June 1976, when he met with the Prime Minister of South Africa in the midst of the Soweto Uprising against Apartheid. Of course, Kissinger and his staff were dealing with\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nmany different subjects during these same periods. Even if it can be established that someone deliberately deleted the messages from the database, the data does not permit us to impute specific motives. But it is notable that the gaps end with the end of Kissinger\u2019s term as secretary of State (See Fig. 2).\nSince Bentham and John Stuart Mill, philosophers have long postulated that secrecy serves to cover up the abuse of power, and that liberty requires transparency. As Louis Brandeis famously observed, \u201csunlight is...the best of disinfectants.\u201d (Brandeis 1914) In analyzing the relationship between these different features, we find intriguing patterns that provide some empirical support for these beliefs. For instance, the first two years of the Carter administration witnessed rapid growth in the number of cables with the SHUM TAGS, designating those related to Human Rights. This was consistent with the Carter administration\u2019s stated policy of promoting democratic values. There was also tremendous growth in the number of human rights organizations. Some, like Freedom House, also reported on the situation in each country, giving them a \u2018Freedom in the World Score\u2019 from 1 (best, e.g. Norway) to worst (7, e.g. North Korea). The index is calculated by grading the country across 10 political rights indicators, such as the electoral process. There are also 15 civil liberties indicators, such as freedom of expression, that are broadly derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nWhen we compare the percentage of cables diplomats wrote about human rights when reporting about different countries in 1977-78 (i.e. by counting the cables in which country TAGS co-reference SHUM TAGS, and comparing it to all cables with these country TAGS) we find only a very weak relationship with the score these countries received from Freedom House (an r of 0.2108108261.) In other words, whether U.S. diplomats were more or less concerned\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nwith the human rights situation in a country had little to do with the human rights situation per se, at least as it was assessed by Freedom House. In fact, U.S. diplomats largely ignored the human rights situation in many allied countries with repressive governments. This is contrary to what outside critics like Jean Kirkpatrick argued at the time. They claimed that Carter had a blanket policy of criticizing human rights violations, which made little difference with Cold War adversaries and only served to delegitimate allied governments (Kirkpatrick, 1979).\nIn fact, there is a striking regional variation in how much U.S. diplomats wrote about human rights -- even more striking when we limit the analysis to countries that imported U.S. arms in this period. Middle Eastern and Latin American countries both tended to have repressive governments, with an average Freedom House score of 4.7 and 4.5 respectively. But there was far more reporting about the human rights situation in Latin America compared to the Middle East. Of cables concerning Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, 5.96% reference Human Rights. For Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, North Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE, it\u2019s <1% (.85%.) (See Fig. 3)\nThese findings are consistent with earlier research by Qian and Yanagizaw showing a divergence between the annual State Department human rights reports and the assessments of Amnesty International. They found that the State Department showed favoritism towards its Cold War allies, which they identified according to how consistently other countries voted with the U.S. at the U.N. General Assembly. But they also control for regional diversity in their assessment (Qian and Yanagizaw 2009). We find that, in fact, the specific situation of allied countries in the Cold War is what is most strongly associated with whether the State Department showed any interest in human rights, and not just whether it criticized human rights violations in\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\npublished reports. When countries were well within the U.S. sphere of influence, and there was little risk of Soviet intervention, such as Latin America in 1973-78, foreign service officers frequently reported on detention, torture, and civil liberties. But they showed little interest in such issues in Middle Eastern countries, where the U.S. and the USSR were engaged in intense competition for influence and the risk of international conflict was high.\nNot coincidentally, countries of the Middle East were also far more likely to have a high percentage of secret cables. Almost fifteen percent (14.82%) of all cables with Middle Eastern country TAGS were classified as secret in 1973-78. For Latin American Countries, it was two percent (2.26%)"}, {"heading": "Results:", "text": "The great advantage of using a machine-learning approach to identify what specific records are more likely to be classified is that it can leverage many subtle interrelationships in multidimensional data. In this case, we used it to identify cables originally classified as Secret; Confidential; Limited Official Use; and Unclassified, which indicate the degree of sensitivity accorded to these communications by the officials who drafted them. We grouped them in various ways to measure the performance of different classifiers depending on how broadly or how narrowly one defines a state secret. Of all the features, the relative frequency of different\nwords in the body  was the most useful in identifying sensitive information. High recall or\nprecision (but not both) is achievable with some of the other features. For instance, it is possible to identify 95% of the cables that are classified as Secret, Confidential, or Limited Official Use\njust by using the sender/recipient  data. But fully a third of the identified cables would be false\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\npositives. Other features produce better overall performance (see Fig. 4). But the best results came from combining all feature as independent vectors.\nTable 4 shows several performance measures when we categorize sensitive information more or less broadly. This can be assessed in terms of accuracy (Walther 2005) (how often is the classifier correct?), recall (also known as true positive rate: how many of the classified cables does it identify?), precision (or false positive rate: how many of the identified cables were actually classified?), and the average f1 score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) for the two classes. We also present the AUC or ROC Score (Hanley 1982) - the area under the curve when plotting the true positive rate (y-axis) against the false positive rate (x-axis) as you vary the threshold for assigning observations to a given class. All of these metrics are derived from the true/false positive and negative counts.\nThere is a notable improvement in performance when we exclude data that does not clearly belong to either category. The \u201cLimited Official Use\u201d designation has long been a cause for complaint. White House Executive Orders from the period classify as \u201cSecret\u201d information that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the national security,\u201d and include specific examples. \u201cConfidential\u201d was the classification for information that could cause \u201cdamage\u201d but not \u201cserious damage\u201d (Federation of American Scientists 1972). Limited Official Use, on the other hand, had no such definition. When the George W. Bush administration attempted such a definition, the Government\u2019s leading FOIA expert admitted it was \u201cso broad that it is almost harder to think of information that does not fall within its scope than information that does\u201d (Metcalfe 2009). This is consistent with our inability to distinguish these cables despite using many different features and multiple classifiers. It is not clear whether any NLP or\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nmachine learning methods would accurately distinguish this category.\nBut the results also show there is some logic in official secrecy, at least to the extent that State Department cables from the 1970s are indicative. Even when we include Limited Official Use cables, just a few kinds of metadata and the relative frequency of words in the message text are enough to identify 90% of classified cables with relatively few (<11%) false positives. Whether a diplomatic communication should be classified may therefore be relatively predictable -- more so than, say, predicting heart disease by data-mining medical records (Chaurasia 2014).\nIf we were able to use all the diplomatic cables from the period, including both those that were lost and those that are still classified, we would likely achieve higher accuracy. But even with all of the data, these methods will sometimes miss crucial contextual elements, such as whether the subject of a seemingly innocuous travel reservation or visa application was on a sensitive mission (See Fig. 5). Other errors might instead reflect the intrinsic subjectivity of at least some classification decisions, especially considering that officials often receive inconsistent or inadequate guidance.\nWhen we began to examine the false positives and false negatives -- i.e. the cables we predicted would be classified, but were unclassified, and vice versa -- we found many instances of human error. For unclassified cables which the algorithm identified as having the highest probability of being classified, this included hundreds of examples where the cables were miscategorized as unclassified in the metadata, such as a report on Japanese government sensitivity about U.S. inspection of its nuclear facilities. The message text itself clearly showed it was originally confidential (Amembassy to Secstate 1977). Other errors included cables that\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nwere originally secret when received at the State Department but were resent to another post as unclassified, such as a report on what Lebanese Christian leaders said about ceasefire negotiations with the PLO (Secstate to Cinceur 1977). And there were many examples of unclassified cables that, according to experts with security clearances we consulted, would have been highly sensitive at the time. This included, for instance, what a confidential informant told U.S. diplomats in Cyprus about the kidnapping of the President\u2019s son (Fig. 2) (Secstate to Usdel 1977)."}, {"heading": "Discussion:", "text": "There is an upper limit to what any supervised learning algorithm can achieve in machine classification: it cannot be more accurate than the intrinsic consistency of the data allows. To the extent humans misclassify their communications -- or simply disagree about how they should be classified -- so too will algorithms.\nIn the debate over the Clinton email, many appear to assume that the post-hoc review created what data scientists would call \u201cground truth\u201d in identifying classified communications. But one could argue that Clinton and her aides were no less expert in recognizing what communications deserved to be classified and contained on a secure system. It might instead be seen as a natural experiment in inter-coder reliability in identifying state secrets. If so, this would be the government\u2019s first such experiment in 75 years of creating official secrets, or at least the first in which it has published the results.\nBut this experiment is flawed and incomplete, especially if it is expected to answer the question\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nof how careless Clinton and her aides were in handling email that were deemed to be classified. These \u201cfalse negatives\u201d constitute 6.9% of the total reviewed. Even if we accepted this as ground truth, we cannot begin to estimate either precision or recall -- and hence accuracy -- without reviewing the communications Clinton and her aides correctly classified as sensitive and\nprotected on a secure system (true positives), and those which they overclassified  (false\npositives). Moreover, one would need to compare the error rate with the error rate for the rest of\nthe State Department. Certainly, the idea that government officials make no errors in identifying sensitive national security information is not supported by the data.\nThe historical data also show with new precision the extent to which officials have preserved, or failed to preserve, the official record. Whereas press coverage of the Clinton controversy has focused on very recent practices of using private e-mail, the historical record shows that diplomats have for centuries used both official and unofficial channels to control access to their communications. What has changed in recent years is that, with the use of electronic records, we can now use computational methods to analyze different kinds of communications. When records are \u201clost\u201d it becomes more difficult, but these acts can also leave statistically conspicuous gaps in the public record that merit further scrutiny. Without this kind of analysis, a democracy loses the capacity to hold individuals and public institutions to account, a great asset against less democratic types of regimes that offsets their ability to act with even greater \u201csecrecy and despatch.\u201d When instead officials do not preserve the public record a democracy is doubly disadvantaged, losing both the capacity to identify and correct errors and incompetence, while still remaining relatively open and prone to leaking compared to autocratic states (Colaresi 2012).\nDraft only -- Not for circulation without authors\u2019 permission\nBased on what we have learned from machine classification, it should be feasible to develop systems in which classified and unclassified communication streams would continually generate data that would be predictive of the appropriate classification level for new communications. Such a system would automatically default to the predicted classification, requiring manual override if the sender wished to classify at a higher or lower level (such as communications about a new classified program, or a subject that is no longer sensitive).\nThe same type of system could be used for accelerating the release of electronic records, harnessing data from previous declassification decisions to prioritize records for close scrutiny that are most likely to have sensitive national security or personal information. These systems could therefore \u201cnudge\u201d officials to classify or declassify communications appropriately, and also reveal which officials tend to diverge from the norm when dealing with similar types of subjects, language, etc. Such a system could therefore be self-correcting, and become increasingly accurate as sources of error were continually identified and corrected for.\nWhat is most needed now is government support for applied research on technology to improve management of sensitive information (Public Interest Declassification Board 2012). This should include rigorous, double-blind testing of how consistent humans are in both classification and declassification. Without determining the expected error rate among humans, we will never know the baseline against which to test computer-assisted approaches -- or evaluate claims that this or that official was negligent in failing to recognize and protect state secrets."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research was made possible through grants from the John D. and Catherine T.

Like Blei et al. (Blei 2003), we define the following terms: A word or token is the basic unit of discrete data, defined to be an item from a vocabulary indexed by {1,...,N}. Words are represented using vectors that have a single component equal to one and all other components equal to zero. A document vector is a sequence of N word counts denoted by w = (w1,w2,...,wN), where wn is the nth word in the sequence and N is the size of the vocabulary. A corpus is a collection of M documents denoted by D = {[w11, w21, ..., wN1],[w12, w22, ..., wN2], ..., [w1M, w2M, ..., wNM]}.\nWith Bag of Words (BoW), documents are represented by vectors of dimension N, where N is the size of the vocabulary or the subset N of the most frequent words of the vocabulary; each column represents a word and the value is the frequency of that word in the document. TfIdf (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) also represents documents as vectors of dimension N, where N is the vocabulary size or the subset N of the most high-valued words in the vocabulary, based on the TfIdf metric: instead of word counts in the columns, it utilizes a method for emphasizing words that occur frequently in a given document (Tf), whilst de-emphasising words that occur frequently in many documents or in the whole corpus of documents (Idf).

The declassification of millions of electronic records has made it possible to analyze these issues with greater rigor and precision. Using machine-learning methods, we examined nearly a million State Department cables from the 1970s to identify features of records that are more likely to be classified, such as international negotiations, military operations, and high-level communications. Even with incomplete data, algorithms can use such features to identify 90% of classified cables with <11% false positives. But our results also show that there are longstanding problems in the identification of sensitive information. Error analysis reveals many examples of both overclassification and underclassification. This indicates both the need for research on inter-coder reliability among officials as to what constitutes classified material and the opportunity to develop recommender systems to better manage both classification and declassification.", "creator": null}}}
