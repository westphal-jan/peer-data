Often RL agents cooperate interactively with human trainers to solve difficult tasks. Human teachers are a unique component of the environment who may deliver control signals and contextual information through feedback. As human-robot interaction becomes more complex, due to rapid advancements in actuator and sensor technology, a significant gap emerges between the number of possible control signals a human can provide and the number of controllable actuators a robotic system. There is often a limited set of control signals which a human can provide, and a large number of robotic system controllable functions.\nThe limit of human provided control signals is of particular interest in the field of robotic prostheses\u2014artificial limbs attached to the body to augment and/or replace abilities lost through injury or illness. Prosthetic limbs with many degrees-of-freedom have been developed [Castellini et al., 2014]. State-of-the-art prosthetics can perform complex functions and movements, but rapid, reactive control of this functionality, by human users, is limited; this limitation causes some users to abandon their devices [Castellini et al., 2014, Biddis et al., 2007, Scheme and Englehart 2011, Micera et al., 2010]. New methods are in development to help humans control complex robotic devices through intelligent control sharing and by allowing a learning agent inside the prosthetic to model the human user. The work presented herein explores RL agents controlled by simulated human electromyography (EMG) signals, with additional reward feedback signals."}, {"heading": "Background", "text": "RL is a learning framework inspired by behaviorism [Skinner, 1938] which describes how agents improve over time by taking actions in an environment with a goal of maximizing expected return\u2014defined as the cumulative future reward signal received by the agent [Sutton and Barto, 1998]. An agent\u2019s control policy is iteratively improved by selecting actions which maximize return. RL problems\nare often described as sequential decision making problems modelled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) which define tuples: (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udefe, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51), full details of MDPs are omitted for space and can be found in [Sutton and Barto, 1998 and Mathewson et al., 2016]. The ultimate goal of an RL agent is to determine a policy which maps a given current state to the correct actions to maximize expected return. In this work we use a continuous actor-critic (AC) algorithm (Algorithm 1) similar to that described in [Pilarski et al. 2011, Pilarski et al. 2013, Mathewson et al. 2016]. AC methods can reduce variance in gradient estimation through the use of two learning systems: a policy-focused actor (selects the best action) and a critic (estimate of value function, criticizes actor) [Sutton and Barto, 1998].\nThe Interactive Shaping Problem (ISP) defines the problem of optimizing the incorporation of human feedback into a learning agent in a sequential decision making problem [Knox and Stone 2010]. The ISP asks: how can the agent learn the best possible task policy as measured by task performance or cumulative human feedback, given the information contained in the human feedback [Knox and Stone, 2009 and 2012]. While there are many ways to incorporate human knowledge into a learning system, before and during learning [Thomaz and Breazeal, 2008; Chernova and Tomaz 2014], this paper focuses on incorporating human feedback directly alongside MDP derived reward.\nThis work builds on the work of Vien and Ertel, who showed that the human feedback model can be generalized to address the problems associated with periods of noisy, and/or inconsistent, human feedback [Vien and Ertel, 2013]. Recent advancements in modelling human feedback with a Bayesian approach have improved on the work of Knox and Stone in discrete environments [Loftin et al., 2015]. Most recently work by MacGlashan et al. show that human feedback may be better modelled as an advantage function to handle changes in a human\u2019s feedback strategy over time [MacGlashan et al., 2016].\nIn this study, we explore the implications of varying several latent variables in human feedback for learning\nalgorithms acting in complex human-machine interaction domains. We investigate the probability of the human trainer providing feedback, the probability that feedback is correct, and the effect of smearing that feedback over time to account for the limited number of time steps with direct human feedback."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Aldebaran Nao and Myo EMG Data", "text": "The experimental set up is shown in Figure 1. It is composed of the Aldebaran Nao robotic platform (Aldebaran Robotics), a wireless Myo EMG armband (Thalmic Labs), and a MacBook Air (Apple, 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7, 8GB RAM) for human feedback and running the learning agent. The experiments in this paper are performed using a simulated Nao platform, a simulated EMG signal, and a simulated human feedback model. We have previously shown the performance of this experimental set-up to be comparable between simulation and real-world experiments [Mathewson et al., 2016]. By simulating the human feedback, we are able to characterize and vary important latent variables hidden from the agent which impact the learning of the system. For this study, we investigate: the rate at which a human-delivered feedback should decay (smear), the probability with which the human will provide a feedback \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58) , and the probability that this feedback will be correct for a given MDP \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61) . These are critical variables that have been estimated in previous experiments [Knox and Stone, 2015, Loftin et al., 2015], we aim to improve understanding of their impact through an experimental grid sweep over the variables of interest and investigation into the results."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "We extend on the results in [Mathewson et al., 2016] by exploring the impacts of varying model parameters of human trainer feedback on the RL system during the performance of a self-mirrored movement control task. In this task, we preprogram the left arm of the Nao to move in a periodic pattern of flexion and extension at the elbow joint. The RL agent controls the right arm and selects angular displacement actions attempting to match the pattern of the left. With this configuration we are able to define an optimal policy, which would track the pre-programmed arm exactly, with this optimal trajectory we are able to derive MDP reward given a set angular error threshold. When the RL-controlled elbow joint is within the angular deviation threshold of the preprogrammed elbow joint then a reward of 1 is received from the MDP, otherwise, a negative rela-\ntive error is delivered proportional to the difference between the actual and optimal angles. We are interested in modelling smear, the time-decay with which the feedback given by the human should be decayed. As the human is unable to give feedback at every step that an agent takes, we need to account for the fact that after the exact time step a feedback is given there are likely suboptimal states which support the optimal trajectory. With a decay parameter we are able to smear the human feedback forward in time, it has been shown that the limited human feedback can be applied across near-optimal state-action pairs, and support the agent learning an optimal solution [Pilarski et al., 2011]. We further explore the following characteristics of human feedback: \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58) the probability of giving feedback on each time step, and \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61) the probability of giving correct vs. incorrect feedback. These are important latent human parameters to understand, cognitively they represent how effective and attentive a human trainer is.\nThe continuous state space is defined by the filtered and time averaged dimensionally reduced EMG signal and the angle of the actuated joint, and is represented with approximation using tile coding identically to Mathewson et al. [Pilarski et al., 2011 and 2013, Mathewson et al., 2016]. Parameters were set as follows: \ud835\udefc: = 0.1 \ud835\udc5a, \ud835\udefc@ = \ud835\udefcA , \ud835\udefe = 0.9, \ud835\udf06D = 0.3, \ud835\udf06: = 0.7, joint angles were limited by manufacturer specifications at \ud835\udf03 \u2208 [0.0349, 1.5446] rads. Weight vectors \ud835\udc86: , \ud835\udc86@ , \ud835\udc86A , v, \ud835\udc98@ and \ud835\udc98A were initialized to 0 and standard deviation was bounded by \ud835\udf0e \u2265 0.01. The eligibility trace update for the critic is scaled by \ud835\udefe to speed up convergence. Maximum number of time steps = 10k, learning update and action selection occurred at ~33 Hz or every ~30 ms, and angular deviation threshold was set to \u2206\ud835\udf03STU = 0.1, absolute angular joint updates were clipped to 0.1 and actions were selected and performed on every time step.\nThe ACRL system was trained online with simulated human feedback and simulated EMG control signals (designed to mimic acceptable control signals). Human feedback is integrated into the learning algorithm as reward accumulated on Step 6 of Algorithm 1. Performance was measured by taking the average mean absolute angular error from the last 5k steps. This was done to compare the experimental results after some learning and helped to reduce noise intrinsic in early learning.\nThis paper presents results of a parameterized grid sweep over three parameters with given estimates of reasonable values: smear = (0.2, 0.5, 0.9), P(feedback) = (0.03, 0.05, 0.09), P(correct) = (0.6, 0.75, 0.9). Additionally, as a control case, n=60 trials without human-feedback were performed. On all time steps MDP reward and human reward were directly summed and applied to the learning agent update (Algorithm 1)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The results are presented in Figure 2. Results are presented which show performance over a variety of combinations of parameters for the latent variables of interest: P(feedback), P(correct) and smear. Results indicate that human interaction improves agent performance on a self-mirroring movement task where performance is measured by the mean angular error over the last 5k time steps. Fig. 2A shows that a lower probability of potentially incorrect feedback provides better performance. Fig. 2B shows that there may not be a significant difference in performance when varying the probability of the correctness human feedback, given tested values of P(feedback). This may also be due to the tested values, which were all greater than a 50% chance of being correct. Fig. 2C shows that there is a benefit to selecting a smear decay value appropriate for the task and robotic control system, this parameter may vary task to task and care must be taken when selecting the smear constant. The results indicate that there is benefit to be gained by correct modelling the latent variables associated with human reward signal to allow for true simultaneous incorporation of human control and feedback. These results indicate that the ACRL algorithm robust to a small amount of incorrect feedback. On average without human-feedback the RL agent was able to attain a mean absolute error on the final 5k steps of 0.22 \u00b1 0.02 (mean \u00b1 SEM, n=60). In comparison, the optimal set of parameters (P(feedback)=0.06, P(correct)=0.6, smear=0.5) was able to attain a performance of 0.12 \u00b1 0.01 (mean \u00b1 SEM, n=7), the worst performing set of parameters (P(feedback)=0.09, P(correct)=0.9, smear=0.9) attained a performance of 0.38 \u00b1 0.18 (mean \u00b1 SEM, n=4). A total of 232 trials were run over parameter combinations."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The experiments in this paper are performed using a simulated Nao, simulated EMG signal and simulated human feedback. It has been previously shown the performance of this experimental set-up to be comparable between simulation and real-world experiments [Mathewson et al., 2016]. In this related work we explore the degree to which the learning system is affected when incorporating real human feedback. While working in simulation allows rapid iteration and enables testing of many different algorithmic characteristics, simulation is often an easier learning problem than the real-world, due to simplified physics and reduced noise. Future work will address robust modelling real human feedback, and quantify impact of varying feedback density and correctness. We have shown that smearing of human feedback impacts learning, future work will investigate if the decay of human delivered rewards is best\nmodelled as time dependent over task performance and if optimal decay parameters may be learned online. In this paper we found that modelling the delivery of human feedback can significantly impact the performance of an ACRL algorithm. While we have not optimized for the human feedback characteristics, these results indicate that some human reward paradigms may be preferable to others [Loftin et al., 2015]. This idea is explored in [MacGlashan et al., 2016] where modelling the user feedback as an advantage function, we can understand positive feed back as \u2018yes, that was good\u2019 and negative feedback as \u2018no, that was bad\u2019. A greater understanding of human reward strategies is required. Personalized robotics will demand\nperception of human strategies to learn optimal in a very few sample. Future work will focus predicting and optimizing for known and uncertain feedback strategies.\nLinking control signals in state space with feedback shaping reward signals effectively blends multisensory human data to the learning agent. There remains an open problem of how feedback should best be interpreted by the learning agent and how to encourage human feedback without causing prohibitive additional cognitive load. Modelling, and predicting, human feedback may relieve burden while allowing for shaping control signal interpretation. Human feedback is beneficial to the agent, providing it adds complimentary information about the contextual state the agent is in. Human feedback may shape the MDP reward with more specificity and more often than the sparse, delayed, MDP-derived reward. Our results demonstrate potential benefits by introducing well modelled human feedback into the robotic learning system. The inclusion of human shaping signals was shown to improve performance over strictly environmentally derived reward. Providing consistent, correct feedback demands cognitive attention from the user which may be difficult if the user is also required to provide control signals to the robotic system. Future work is introduced to explore implications of inviting humans to simultaneously provide control and feedback signals to learning systems."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper contributes a set of results from experiments incorporating simulated human feedback and simultaneous human control in the training of a semi-autonomous robotic agent. These results indicate that task performance increases with the incorporation of human feedback into existing actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms. These results support the idea that human interaction can improve performance in complex robotic tasks when the human feedback is delivered correctly, consistently, and on a time scale consistent with the original learning problem. This work supports an emerging viewpoint surrounding human training of a robotic system tightly coupled to a user.
