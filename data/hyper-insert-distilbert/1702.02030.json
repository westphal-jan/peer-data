Introduction", "text": "Stochastic optimization occurs in almost all areas of science and engineering, such as machine learning, statistics and operations research (Shapiro et al., 2014). In this problem, the goal is to optimize the value of an expected objective function F (\u00b7) over some set W, i.e.,\nmin w\u2208W F (w) = Ef\u223cP [f(w)] , (1)\nwhere f(\u00b7) : W 7\u2192 R is a random function sampled from a (possibly unknown) distribution P. A well-known special case is the risk minimization problem in supervised learning (Vapnik,\n1998, 2000), which takes the following form\nmin h\u2208H F (h) = E(x,y)\u223cD [\u2113(h(x), y)] , (2)\nwhere H = {h : X 7\u2192 R} is a hypothesis class, (x, y) \u2208 X \u00d7 R is an instance-label pair sampled from a distribution D, and \u2113(\u00b7, \u00b7) : R \u00d7 R 7\u2192 R is certain loss. In this paper, we mainly focus on the convex version of (1), namely stochastic convex optimization (SCO), where both the domain W and the expected function F (\u00b7) are convex.\nTwo classical approaches for solving stochastic optimization are stochastic approximation (SA) (Kushner and Yin, 2003) and the sample average approximation (SAA), the latter of which is also referred to as empirical risk minimization (ERM) in the machine learning community (Vapnik, 1998). While both SA and ERM have been extensively studied in recent years (Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002; Bartlett et al., 2005; Koltchinskii, 2011; Nemirovski et al., 2009; Moulines and Bach, 2011), most theoretical guarantees of ERM are restricted to the supervised learning problem in (2). As pointed out in a seminal work of Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009), the success of ERM for supervised learning cannot be directly extended to stochastic optimization. Actually, Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009) have constructed an instance of SCO that is learnable by SA but cannot be solved by ERM. Literatures about ERM for stochastic optimization (including SCO) are quite limited, and we still lack a full understanding of the theory.\nIn ERM, we are given n i.i.d. functions f1, . . . , fn sampled from P, and minimize an empirical objective function:\nmin w\u2208W\nF\u0302 (w) = 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\nfi(w). (3)\nLet w\u0302 \u2208 argmin w\u2208W F\u0302 (w) be the empirical minimizer. The performance of ERM is measured in terms of the excess risk defined as\nF (w\u0302)\u2212 min w\u2208W F (w).\nState-of-the-art risk bounds of ERM include: an O\u0303( \u221a\nd/n) bound when the random function f(\u00b7) is Lipschitz continuous,1 where d is the dimensionality of w; an O(1/\u03bbn) bound when f(\u00b7) is \u03bb-strongly convex (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2009); and an O\u0303(d/\u03b7n) bound when f(\u00b7) is \u03b7-exponentially concave (\u03b7-exp-concave) (Mehta, 2016). From existing studies of ERM for supervised learning (Srebro et al., 2010), we know that smoothness can be utilized to boost the risk bound. Thus, it is natural to ask whether smoothness can also be exploited to improve the performance of ERM for SCO. This paper provides an affirmative answer to this question. Indeed, we propose a general approach for analyzing the excess risk bound of ERM, which brings several improved risk bounds and new risk bounds as well.\nTo state our results, we first introduce some notations. Let F\u2217 = minw\u2208W F (w) be the minimal risk, \u03bb be the modulus of strong convexity of F (\u00b7) and L be the modulus of smoothness of f(\u00b7). Denote by \u03ba = L/\u03bb the condition number of the problem. Our and previous results of ERM for SCO are summarized in Table 1, where we make explicit the\n1. We use the O\u0303 and \u2126\u0303 notations to hide constant factors as well as polylogarithmic factors in d and n.\nassumptions on the random function f(\u00b7), the empirical function F\u0302 (w) and the expected function F (\u00b7). For our results of ERM for SCO, we assume the domain is bounded, and the random function is nonnegative. We highlight the significance of this work as follows:\n\u2022 When f(\u00b7) is both convex and smooth and F (\u00b7) is Lipschitz continuous, we establish an O\u0303(d/n + \u221a F\u2217/n) risk bound (c.f. Theorem 1). In the optimistic case that F\u2217 is\nsmall, i.e., F\u2217 = O(d 2/n), we obtain an O\u0303(d/n) risk bound, which is analogous to the O\u0303(1/n) optimistic rate of ERM for supervised learning (Srebro et al., 2010) and also matches a recent lower bound of ERM for SCO (Feldman, 2016, Theorem 3.10). \u2022 If F (\u00b7) is also \u03bb-strongly convex, we prove an O\u0303 (d/n + \u03baF\u2217/n) risk bound, and improve it to O(1/[\u03bbn2]+\u03baF\u2217/n) when n = \u2126\u0303(\u03bad) (c.f. Theorem 3). Thus, if n is large and F\u2217 is small, i.e., F\u2217 = O(1/n), we get an O(\u03ba/n\n2) risk bound, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first O(1/n2)-type of risk bound of ERM. \u2022 When neither convexity is present in f(\u00b7) nor Lipschitz continuity is present in F (\u00b7), as long as f(\u00b7) is smooth, F\u0302 (\u00b7) is convex and F (\u00b7) is strongly convex, we still obtain an improved risk bound of O(1/[\u03bbn2] + \u03baF\u2217/n) when n = \u2126\u0303(\u03ba\n2d), which will further implies an O(\u03ba/n2) risk bound if F\u2217 = O(1/n) (c.f. Theorem 5). \u2022 If strong convexity is also absent in F (\u00b7), assuming f(\u00b7) is smooth and both F\u0302 (\u00b7) and F (\u00b7) are convex, we obtain an O\u0303( \u221a d/n) risk bound (c.f. Theorem 7). This result\nbreaks the barrier of non-learnability of bounded convex functions (Feldman, 2016, Theorem 5.2) by exploiting the smoothness of random functions. \u2022 Finally, we extend the O(1/[\u03bbn2] + \u03baF\u2217/n) risk bound to supervised learning with a generalized linear form. Our analysis shows that in this case, the lower bound of n can be replaced with \u2126(\u03ba2), which is dimensionality-independent (c.f. Theorem 8). Thus, this result can be applied to infinite dimensional cases, e.g., learning with kernels."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "In this section, we give a brief introduction to previous work on stochastic optimization."}, {"heading": "2.1 ERM for Stochastic Optimization", "text": "As we mentioned earlier, there are few works devoted to ERM for stochastic optimization. When W \u2282 Rd is bounded and f(\u00b7) is Lipschitz continuous, Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009) demonstrate that F\u0302 (w) converges to F (w) uniformly over W with an O\u0303( \u221a d/n) error bound that holds with high probability, implying an O\u0303( \u221a\nd/n) risk bound of ERM. They further establish an O(1/\u03bbn) risk bound of ERM that holds in expectation when f(\u00b7) is \u03bb-strongly convex and Lipschitz continuous. Stochastic optimization with exp-concave functions is studied recently (Koren and Levy, 2015),2 and Mehta (2016) proves an O\u0303(d/\u03b7n) bound of ERM that holds with high probability when f(\u00b7) is \u03b7-exp-concave, Lipschitz continuous, and bounded. Lower bounds of ERM for stochastic optimization is investigated by Feldman (2016), who exhibits (i) a lower bound of \u2126(d/\u01eb2) sample complexity for uniform convergence that nearly matches the upper bound of Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009); and (ii) a lower bound of \u2126(d/\u01eb) sample complexity of ERM, which is matched by our O\u0303(d/n + \u221a F\u2217/n) bound when F\u2217 is small. It is worth mentioning the difference among proof techniques in these works. The uniform convergence result of Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009) leverages the covering number to bound |F\u0302 (w) \u2212 F (w)| for any w \u2208 W. The analysis for strongly convex functions by Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009) and exp-concave functions by Koren and Levy (2015) utilize the tool of stability, which only produces risk bounds that hold in expectation. A simple way to achieve a high probability bound is to use ERM combined with a generic or specific boosting-the-confidence method (Mehta, 2016; Haussler et al., 1991), but the guarantee is not directly on the empirical minimizer as noted by Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009). The convergence of ERM given by Mehta (2016) relies on a central condition or \u201cstochastic mixability\u201d of the exp-concave function. In this paper, we present a general approach for analyzing ERM for SCO of smooth functions. In particular, our analysis is based on a uniform convergence of \u2207F\u0302 (w) \u2212 \u2207F\u0302 (w\u2217) to \u2207F (w) \u2212 \u2207F (w\u2217) for any w \u2208 W, and a concentration inequality of \u2016\u2207F\u0302 (w\u2217)\u2212\u2207F (w\u2217)\u2016, where w\u2217 is the optimal solution to (1)."}, {"heading": "2.2 ERM for Supervised Learning", "text": "We note that there are extensive studies on ERM for supervised learning, and hence the review here is non-exhaustive. In the context of supervised learning, the performance of ERM is closely related to the uniform convergence of F\u0302 (\u00b7) to F (\u00b7) over the hypothesis 2. Their excess risk bound is for a regularized empirical risk minimizer.\nclass H (Koltchinskii, 2011). In fact, uniform convergence is a sufficient condition for learnability (Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014), and in some special cases such as binary classification, it is also a necessary condition (Vapnik, 1998). The accuracy of uniform convergence, as well as the quality of the empirical minimizer, can be upper bounded in terms of the complexity of the hypothesis classH, including data-independent measures such as the VC-dimension and data-dependent measures such as the Rademacher complexity.\nGenerally speaking, when H has finite VC-dimension, the excess risk can be upper bounded by O( \u221a VC(H)/n), where VC(H) is the VC-dimension of H. If the loss \u2113(\u00b7, \u00b7) is Lipschitz continuous with respect to its first argument, we have a risk bound of O(1/ \u221a n+ Rn(H)), where Rn(H) is the Rademacher complexity of H. The Rademacher complexity typically scales as Rn(H) = O(1/ \u221a n), e.g., H contains linear functions with low-norm,\nimplying an O(1/ \u221a n) risk bound (Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002). There have been intensive efforts to derive rates faster than O(1/ \u221a n) under various conditions (Lee et al., 1996; Panchenko, 2002; Bartlett et al., 2005; Gonen and Shalev-Shwartz, 2016), such as low-noise (Tsybakov, 2004), smoothness (Srebro et al., 2010), strong convexity (Sridharan et al., 2009), to name a few amongst many. Specifically, when the random function f(\u00b7) is nonnegative and smooth, Srebro et al. (2010) have established a risk bound of O\u0303(R2n(H) + Rn(H) \u221a F\u2217), reducing to an O\u0303(1/n) bound if Rn(H) = O(1/ \u221a n) and F\u2217 = O(1/n). A generalized linear form of (2) is studied by Sridharan et al. (2009), and a risk bound of O(1/\u03bbn) is proved if the expected function F (\u00b7) is \u03bb-strongly convex."}, {"heading": "2.3 SA for Stochastic Optimization", "text": "Stochastic approximation (SA) solves the stochastic optimization problem via noisy observations of the expected function (Kushner and Yin, 2003). For brevity, we only discuss first-order methods for SCO, and in this case, n is the number of stochastic gradients consumed by the algorithm. For Lipschitz continuous convex functions, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits the optimal O(1/ \u221a n) risk bound (Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983). When the random function f(\u00b7) is nonnegative and smooth, SGD (with a suitable step size) has a risk bound of O(1/n + \u221a F\u2217/n), becoming O(1/n) if F\u2217 = O(1/n) (Srebro et al., 2010, Corollary 4). If F (\u00b7) is \u03bb-strongly convex, some variants of SGD (Hazan and Kale, 2011; Rakhlin et al., 2012) achieve an O(1/\u03bbn) rate which is known to be minimax optimal (Agarwal et al., 2012). For the square loss and the logistic loss, an O(1/n) rate is attainable without any strong convexity assumptions (Bach and Moulines, 2013). When the random function f(\u00b7) is \u03b7-exp-concave, the online Newton step (ONS) is equipped with an O\u0303(d/\u03b7n) risk bound (Hazan et al., 2007; Mahdavi et al., 2015)."}, {"heading": "3.

The second part of Corollary 4 indeed provides such a bound, but under an additional condition n = \u2126\u0303(\u03bad).\nRemark 4 The second part implies that when n is large enough, i.e., n = \u2126\u0303(\u03bad), the risk bound can be tightened to O(1/[\u03bbn2] + \u03baF\u2217/n). In particular, when the minimal risk is small, i.e., F\u2217 = O(1/n), we obtain an O(\u03ba/n\n2) bound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first O(1/n2)-type of risk bound of ERM, and even in the studies of stochastic approximation, we have not found similar theoretical guarantees. Finally, it is worth to point out the following two features of the second part:\n\u2022 Although the lower bound of n depends on d, the risk bound is independent of d. \u2022 The domain size R only appears in the lower bound of n, and the dependence is\nlogarithmic. Our next result shows that the individual convexity assumption, i.e., Assumption 4(d), and the Lipschitz continuity assumption, i.e., Assumptions 3, in Theorem 3 can be relaxed. To be specific, Assumptions 4(d) and 3 can be replaced with Assumption 4(c).\nTheorem 5 Under Assumptions 1, 2, 4(b), and 4(c), with probability at least 1 \u2212 2\u03b4, we have\nF (w\u0302)\u2212 F (w\u2217) \u2264 4R2LC(\u03b5)\nn +\n4R2L2C(\u03b5)\n\u03bbn +\n4RM log(2/\u03b4)\nn +\n8LF\u2217 log(2/\u03b4)\n\u03bbn\n+ ( 4RL+ 2RL \u221a C(\u03b5)\nn +\n2RLC(\u03b5)\nn\n) \u03b5.\n(14)\nFurthermore, if\nn \u2265 25L 2C(\u03b5)\n\u03bb2 = 25\u03ba2C(\u03b5), (15)\nwe also have\nF (w\u0302)\u2212 F (w\u2217) \u2264 8M2 log2(2/\u03b4)\n\u03bbn2 +\n32LF\u2217 log(2/\u03b4)\n\u03bbn +\n( 32L2\n\u03bb +\n416\u03bb\n625\n) \u03b52. (16)\nWe have the following corollary to simplify the above theorem.\nCorollary 6 By setting \u03b5 = 1/n in Theorem 5, we have C(1/n) = \u0398(d log n), and with high probability\nF (w\u0302)\u2212 F (w\u2217) = O ( \u03bad log n\nn + \u03baF\u2217 n\n) = O\u0303 ( \u03bad\nn + \u03baF\u2217 n\n) = O\u0303 ( \u03bad\nn\n) .\nSetting \u03b5 = 1/n2, we have C(1/n2) = \u0398(d log n), and when n = \u2126 ( \u03ba2d log n ) = \u2126\u0303(\u03ba2d), with high probability\nF (w\u0302)\u2212 F (w\u2217) = O ( 1\n\u03bbn2 + \u03baF\u2217 n\n) .\nRemark 5 Comparing the first part of Corollaries 6 and 4, we observe that without the individual convexity and Lipschitz continuity, the risk bound is increased from O\u0303 (d/n + \u03baF\u2217/n) to O\u0303(\u03bad/n + \u03baF\u2217/n).\nRemark 6 Comparing the second part of Corollaries 6 and 4, we can see that the risk bound is on the same order, but the lower bound of n is increased by a factor of \u03ba. It is interesting to mention that a similar phenomenon also happens in stochastic approximation. Recently, a variance reduction technique named SVRG (Johnson and Zhang, 2013) or EMGD (Zhang et al., 2013) was proposed for stochastic optimization when both full gradients and stochastic gradients are available. In the analysis, SVRG assumes the stochastic function is convex, while EMGD does not. From their theoretical results, we observe that the individual convexity leads to a difference of \u03ba factor in the sample complexity of stochastic gradients.\nFinally, we want to mention that even when the strong convexity assumption in Theorem 5 is missing, a risk bound of O\u0303( \u221a d/n) is still attainable.\nTheorem 7 Under Assumptions 1, 2, 4(a), and 4(c), with probability at least 1 \u2212 2\u03b4, we have\nF (w\u0302)\u2212 F (w\u2217) \u2264 4R2LC(\u03b5)\nn +\n4RM log(2/\u03b4)\nn + 4R2L\n\u221a C(\u03b5)\nn + 2R\n\u221a 8LF\u2217 log(2/\u03b4)\nn\n+ ( 4RL+ 2RL \u221a C(\u03b5)\nn +\n2RLC(\u03b5)\nn\n) \u03b5.\nRemark 7 In a recent work, Feldman (2016) shows that SCO without the Lipschitz condition cannot be solved by ERM. Theorem 7 exhibits that as long as the random function is smooth, SCO is learnable by ERM."}, {"heading": "3.3 Risk Bounds for Supervised Learning", "text": "If the conditions of Theorem 3 or Theorem 5 are satisfied, we can directly use them to establish an O(1/[\u03bbn2] + \u03baF\u2217/n) risk bound for supervised learning. However, a major limitation of these theorems is that the lower bound of n depends on the dimensionality d, and thus cannot be applied to infinite dimensional cases, e.g., kernel methods (Scho\u0308lkopf and Smola, 2002). In this section, we exploit the structure of supervised learning to make the theory dimensionality-independent.\nWe focus on the generalized linear form of supervised learning:\nmin w\u2208W\nF (w) = E(x,y)\u223cD [\u2113(\u3008w,x\u3009, y)] + r(w), (17)\nwhere \u2113(\u3008w,x\u3009, y) is the loss of predicting \u3008w,x\u3009 when the true target is y, and r(\u00b7) is a regularizer. Given n training examples (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) independently sampled from D, the empirical objective is\nmin w\u2208W\nF\u0302 (w) = 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u2113(\u3008w,xi\u3009, yi) + r(w).\nWe define\nH(w) = E(x,y)\u223cD [\u2113(\u3008w,x\u3009, y)] and H\u0302(w) = 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u2113(\u3008w,xi\u3009, yi)\nto capture the stochastic component. Besides 4(b) and 4(c), we introduce the following additional assumptions. We abuse the same notation \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 to denote the norm induced by the inner product of a Hilbert space.\nAssumption 5 The domain W is a convex subset of a Hilbert space H, and is bounded by R, that is,\n\u2016w\u2016 \u2264 R, \u2200w \u2208 W. (18)\nAssumption 6 The norm of the random data x \u2208 H is upper bounded by a constant D, that is,\n\u2016x\u2016 \u2264 D, \u2200(x, y) \u223c D. (19)\nAssumption 7 For any (x, y) \u223c D, \u2113(\u00b7, y) is nonnegative, and \u03b2-smooth over [\u2212DR,DR], that is,\n|\u2113\u2032(u, y) \u2212 \u2113\u2032(v, y)| \u2264 \u03b2|u\u2212 v|, \u2200u, v \u2208 [\u2212DR,DR]. (20)\nAssumption 8 The regularizer r(\u00b7) is P -Lipschitz continuous over W, that is,\n|r(w)\u2212 r(w\u2032)| \u2264 P\u2016w \u2212w\u2032\u2016, \u2200w,w\u2032 \u2208 W. (21)\nRemark 8 The above assumptions allow us to model many popular losses in machine learning, such as (regularized) least squares and (regularized) logistic regression. Assumptions 6 and 7 imply the random function \u2113(\u3008\u00b7,x\u3009, y) is \u03b2D2-smooth over W. To see this, for any w,w\u2032 \u2208 W, we have\n\u2225\u2225\u2207\u2113(\u3008w,x\u3009, y) \u2212\u2207\u2113(\u3008w\u2032,x\u3009, y) \u2225\u2225 = \u2225\u2225\u2113\u2032(\u3008w,x\u3009, y)x \u2212 \u2113\u2032(\u3008w\u2032,x\u3009, y)x \u2225\u2225\n(19) \u2264 D|\u2113\u2032(\u3008w,x\u3009, y) \u2212 \u2113\u2032(\u3008w\u2032,x\u3009, y)| (20) \u2264 \u03b2D|\u3008w,x\u3009 \u2212 \u3008w\u2032,x\u3009| (19) \u2264 \u03b2D2\u2016w \u2212w\u2032\u2016.\nBy Jensen\u2019s inequality, H(\u00b7) is also \u03b2D2-smooth. Notice that \u03b2D2 is the modulus of smoothness of H(\u00b7), and \u03bb is the modulus of strong convexity of F (\u00b7). With a slight abuse of notation, we define L = \u03b2D2, and the condition number \u03ba as the ratio between L and \u03bb, i.e., \u03ba = L/\u03bb. Finally, we note that the regularizer r(\u00b7) could be non-smooth.\nRecall that w\u2217 \u2208 argminw\u2208W F (w) and w\u0302 \u2208 argminw\u2208W F\u0302 (w). We have the following excess risk bound of ERM for supervised learning.\nTheorem 8 For any 0 < \u03b4 < 1, define\nM = sup (x,y)\u223cD\n\u2016\u2207\u2113(\u3008w\u2217,x\u3009, y)\u2016, (22)\nC = 4 ( 8 + \u221a 2 log\n\u23082 log2(n) + log2(2R)\u2309 \u03b4\n) , (23)\nH\u2217 = H(w\u2217) = F (w\u2217)\u2212 r(w\u2217). (24)\nUnder Assumptions 4(b), 4(c), 5, 6, 7, and 8, with probability at least 1\u2212 2\u03b4, we have\nF (w\u0302)\u2212 F (w\u2217) \u2264 max ( M + P\nn2 +\nL 2n4 , 4R2L2C2 \u03bbn + 4RM log(2/\u03b4) n + 8LH\u2217 log(2/\u03b4) \u03bbn\n) .\n(25) Furthermore, if\nn \u2265 16L 2C2\n\u03bb2 = 16\u03ba2C2, (26)\nwith probability at least 1\u2212 2\u03b4, we have\nF (w\u0302)\u2212 F (w\u2217) \u2264 max ( M + P\nn2 +\nL 2n4 , 8M2 log2(2/\u03b4) \u03bbn2 + 16LH\u2217 log(2/\u03b4) \u03bbn\n) . (27)\nRemark 9 The first part of Theorem 8 presents an O(\u03ba/n) risk bound,3 similar to the O(1/\u03bbn) risk bound of Sridharan et al. (2009). The second part is an O(1/[\u03bbn2] + \u03baH\u2217/n) risk bound, and in this case, the lower bound of n is \u2126(\u03ba2), which is dimensionalityindependent. Thus, Theorem 8 can be applied even when the dimensionality is infinite. Generally speaking, the regularizer r(\u00b7) is nonnegative, and thus H\u2217 \u2264 F\u2217. So, the second bound is even better than those in Theorems 3 and 5. Finally, we note that Theorem 8 should be treated as a counterpart of Theorem 5 for supervised learning, because both of them do not rely on the individual complexity, i.e., Assumption 4(d). One may wonder whether it is possible to derive a counterpart of Theorem 3, that is, whether it is possible to utilize the individual convexity to reduce the lower bound of n by a factor of \u03ba.

Conclusions and Future work", "text": "In this paper, we study the excess risk of ERM for SCO. Our theoretical results show that it is possible to achieve O(1/n)-type of risk bounds under (i) the smoothness and small minimal risk conditions (i.e., Theorem 1) or (ii) the smoothness and strong convexity conditions (i.e., the first part of Theorems 3, 5, and 8). A more exciting result is that when n is large enough, ERM has O(1/n2)-type of risk bounds under the smoothness, strong convexity, and small minimal risk conditions (i.e., the second part of Theorems 3, 5, and 8).\nIn the context of SCO, there remain many open problems about ERM.\n1. Our current results are restricted to the Hilbert or Euclidean space, because the smoothness and strong convexity are defined in terms of the \u21132-norm. We will extend our analysis to other geometries in the future. 2. As mentioned in Remark 3, under the strong convexity condition, a dimensionalityindependent risk bound, e.g., O\u0303(\u03ba/n) or O\u0303(1/\u03bbn), that holds with high probability is still missing. 3. As discussed in Remark 9, it is unclear whether the convexity of the loss can be exploited to improve the lower bound of n in the second part of Theorem 8. Ideally, we expect that n = \u2126(\u03ba) is sufficient to deliver an O(1/[\u03bbn2] + \u03baH\u2217/n) risk bound. 4. The O(1/n2)-type of risk bounds require both the smoothness and strong convexity conditions. One may investigate whether strong convexity can be relaxed to other weaker conditions, such as exponential concavity. Finally, as far as we know, there are no O(1/n2)-type of risk bounds for stochastic approximation (SA). We will try to establish such bounds for SA."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.

In this work, we strengthen the realm of ERM for SCO by exploiting smoothness and strong convexity conditions to improve the risk bounds. First, we establish an \u00d5(d/n+ \u221a F\u2217/n) risk bound when the random function is nonnegative, convex and smooth, and the expected function is Lipschitz continuous, where d is the dimensionality of the problem, n is the number of samples, and F\u2217 is the minimal risk. Thus, when F\u2217 is small we obtain an \u00d5(d/n) risk bound, which is analogous to the \u00d5(1/n) optimistic rate of ERM for supervised learning. Second, if the objective function is also \u03bb-strongly convex, we prove an \u00d5(d/n + \u03baF\u2217/n) risk bound where \u03ba is the condition number, and improve it to O(1/[\u03bbn] + \u03baF\u2217/n) when n = \u03a9\u0303(\u03bad). As a result, we obtain an O(\u03ba/n) risk bound under the condition that n is large and F\u2217 is small, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first O(1/n)-type of risk bound of ERM. Third, we stress that the above results are established in a unified framework, which allows us to derive new risk bounds under weaker conditions, e.g., without convexity of the random function and Lipschitz continuity of the expected function. Finally, we demonstrate that to achieve an O(1/[\u03bbn] + \u03baF\u2217/n) risk bound for supervised learning, the \u03a9\u0303(\u03bad) requirement on n can be replaced with \u03a9(\u03ba), which is dimensionality-independent.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
