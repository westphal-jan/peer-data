INTRODUCTION\nImagine riding in a self-driving car that needs to quickly change lanes to make a right turn. The car suddenly brakes in order to merge safely behind a car, because it deems it unsafe to speed up and merge in front. A passenger who knows the car is defensive and that it values safety much more than efficiency would be able to anticipate this behavior. But passengers less familiar with the car would not anticipate this sudden braking, so they may be surprised and possibly frightened.\nThere are many reasons why it is beneficial for humans to be able to anticipate a robot\u2019s movements, from subjective comfort [6] to ease of coordination when working with and around the robot [7, 21]. However, people have difficulty anticipating robot actions [6, 8, 14]. Our goal is to enable end-users to accurately anticipate how a robot will act, even in novel situations that they have not seen the robot act in before\u2014like a new traffic scenario, or a new placement of objects on a table that the robot needs to clear.\nA robot\u2019s behavior in any situation is a direct consequence of the objective (or reward) function the robot is optimizing: (most) robots are rational agents, acting to maximize expected cumulative reward [19]. Whether the robot\u2019s objective function is hard-coded or learned, it captures the trade-offs the robot makes between different features relevant to the task. For instance, a car might trade off between features related to collision avoidance and efficiency [13], with more \u201caggressive\u201d\ncars prioritizing efficiency at the detriment of, say, distance to obstacles [20].\nThe insight underlying our approach is that the key to end-users being able to anticipate what a robot will do in novel situations is having a good mental model or understanding of the robot\u2019s objective function.\nNote that understanding the objective function does not mean users must be able to explicate it\u2014to write down the equation, or even to assign the correct reward to a behavior or a state-action pair. Instead, users should have an implicit representation of what drives the robot\u2019s behavior. In the autonomous driving domain, a user should qualitatively understand the trade-offs that the car is making, perhaps that it tends to drive more \u201caggressively,\u201d thereby enabling them to better anticipate what the car will do in different traffic scenarios.\nFortunately, users will naturally develop and improve their mental model of the robot\u2019s objective function, given examples of the robot behaving optimally with respect to its true objective. People naturally make inferences about an agent\u2019s objective function when observing behavior [10], and get better over time at anticipating how robots will act [6].\nHowever, in many environments a robot\u2019s optimal behavior does not fully define how the robot will behave in all environments; parts of the robot\u2019s objective will be under-determined. For example, an autonomous car driving down a highway with no other cars around will drive at the speed limit and stay in its lane, regardless of whether its objective places a higher value on efficiency or staying far away from other cars. Another example, shown on the right of Fig. 1, is when a car can change lanes without interacting with any other vehicles. An end-user mainly exposed to these types of behavior will take\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n03 46\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 1\n1 Fe\nb 20\n17\na long time to form an accurate mental model of the robot\u2019s objective function and anticipate how the robot will behave in more complex scenarios.\nOn the other hand, suppose an autonomous car chooses to speed up and merge in front of another car, cutting it off (Fig. 1, left). This scenario illustrates this car values efficiency more.\nWe focus on enabling robots to purposefully choose such informative behaviors that actively communicate the robot\u2019s objective function. We envision a training phase for interaction, where the robot showcases informative behavior in order to quickly teach the end-user what it is optimizing for.\nIn order to choose the most informative example behaviors for communicating a robot\u2019s objective function to humans, we take an algorithmic teaching approach [2, 9, 12, 18, 25, 27]: we model how humans make inferences about the robot\u2019s objective function from examples of its optimal behavior, to generate examples that increase the probability of the correct inferred objective function. The opposite problem, machines inferring objective functions from observed human behavior, can be solved using Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) [16]. Prior work has investigated how to teach an objective function through example behavior to machine learners running IRL [5].\nThe challenge in teaching people instead of machines is that while machines can perform exact inference, people are likely to be approximate in their inference.1 People do not have direct access to configuration-space trajectory and the exact environment state, whereas robots do, at least in kinesthetic teaching (and in [5]). People also cannot necessarily distinguish between a perfectly optimal trajectory for one objective and an ever-so-slightly suboptimal one [24].\nOur main contribution is to introduce a systematic collection of approximate-inference models and, in a user study, compare their performance relative to the exact inference model. We focus on the autonomous driving domain, where a car chooses example behaviors that are informative about the trade-offs it makes in its objective function. We measure teaching performance\u2014how useful the generated examples are in enabling users to anticipate the car\u2019s behavior in test situations\u2014and find that one particular approximate-inference model significantly outperforms exact inference (the others perform on par). This supports our central hypothesis that accounting for approximations in user inference is indeed helpful, but suggests that we need to be careful about how we model this approximate inference.\nFurther analysis shows teaching performance correlates with covering the full space of strategies that the robot is capable of adopting. For instance, the teaching algorithm cannot just show the car cutting people off, it also needs to show an example where it is optimal to brake and merge behind. We show the best results are obtained by a coverage-augmented algorithm that leverages an approximate-inference user model while encouraging full coverage of all possible driving strategies.\nOur work takes a first stab at an important yet under-\n1Prior work has applied algorithmic teaching to teach humans, primarily for binary classification of images [3, 4, 11, 22]. In line with our work, Patil et al. show accounting for human limitations (in their case limiting the number of recalled examples) improves teaching performance [17].\nexplored problem of making robot objectives more transparent to people. This is important in the short term for human-robot interaction, as well as in the long term for building AI systems that are trustworthy and beneficial to people. Our results are encouraging, but also leave room for better models of how people extrapolate from observed robot behavior."}, {"heading": "II.

Exact-Inference IRL as a Special Case", "text": "Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) [16] extracts an objective function from observed behavior by assuming that the observed behavior is optimizing some objective from a set of candidates. When that assumption is correct, IRL finds an objective function that assigns maximum reward (or minimum cost) to the observed behavior.\nAlgorithmic teaching has been used with exact-inference IRL learners [5]: the learner eliminates all objective functions which would not assign maximum reward to the observed behavior. This can be expressed by the model in (4) via a particular distribution for P (\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE |\u03b8):\nP (\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE |\u03b8) =\n{ 1, if \u2200\u03beE , \u03b8>\u03c6(\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE )\u2212 \u03b8>\u03c6(\u03beE) \u2265 0. 0, otherwise.

Thus, each trajectory that the person observes completely eliminates from their belief any objective function that would not have produced exactly this trajectory when optimized. Assuming learners start with a uniform prior over objective functions, the resulting belief is a uniform distribution across the remaining candidate objective functions\u2014across \u03b8s for which all observed trajectories are perfectly optimal.\nWhile this is a natural starting point, it relies on people being able to perfectly evaluate whether a trajectory is the (or one of the) global optima of any candidate objective function. We relax this requirement in our approximate-inference models."}, {"heading": "D. Approximate-Inference Models", "text": "We introduce a space of approximate-inference models, obtained by manipulating two factors in a 2\u2013by\u20133 factorial design. Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Effect. In the exact-inference model, a candidate \u03b8 is either out or still in: the trajectories observed so far have either shown that \u03b8 is impossible (because they were not global optima for the objective induced by that \u03b8), or have left it in the mix, assigning it equal probability as the other remaining \u03b8s.\nWe envision two ways to relax the assumption that a person can perfectly identify whether a trajectory is a global optimum given a \u03b8:\nOne way is for observed trajectories to still either eliminate the \u03b8 or keep it in the running, but to be more conservative about which \u03b8s get eliminated. That is, even if the observed trajectory is not a perfect global optimum for a \u03b8, the person will not eliminate that \u03b8 if the trajectory is close enough (under some distance metric) to the global optimum. We call this the deterministic effect.\nA second way is for observed trajectories to have a probabilistic effect on \u03b8s: rather than eliminating them completely. I.e., trajectories can make a \u03b8 less likely, depending on how far away its optimal trajectory is from the observed trajectory.\nIn both cases, P (\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE |\u03b8) no longer depends on the example trajectory being optimal with respect to \u03b8. Instead, it depends on the distance d(\u03be\u03b8E , \u03be \u03b8\u2217\nE ) between the optimal trajectory for \u03b8 and the observed trajectory (optimal with respect to \u03b8\u2217).\nGiven some distance metric d and hyperparameters \u03c4, \u03bb > 0, \u2022 For deterministic effect, P (\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE |\u03b8) \u221d 0 if d(\u03be\u03b8E , \u03be\u03b8 \u2217 E ) > \u03c4 , or 1 otherwise.\n\u2022 For probabilistic effect, P (\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE |\u03b8) \u221d e\u2212\u03bb\u00b7d(\u03be \u03b8 E ,\u03be\n\u03b8\u2217 E ).5\nThe deterministic effect results in conservative hypothesis elimination: it models a user who will either completely eliminate a \u03b8 or not, but who will not eliminate \u03b8s with optimal trajectories close to the example trajectory. In contrast, the probabilistic effect decreases the probability of \u03b8s with far away optimal trajectories, never fully eliminating any.\nThe exact-inference IRL model (Sec. II-C) is a special case with deterministic effect and a reward-based distance metric with \u03c4 = 0; it assumes there is no approximate inference. Distance Metrics. Both deterministic and probabilistic effects rely on the person\u2019s notion of how close the optimal trajectory with respect to a \u03b8 is from the observed trajectory. We envision that closeness can be measured either in terms of the reward of the trajectories with respect to \u03b8, or in terms of the trajectories themselves.\nWe explore three options for d. The first depends on the reward. This distance metric models people with difficulty comparing the cumulative discounted rewards of two trajectories, with respect to a given setting of the reward parameters. So, if in environment E the example trajectory \u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE has almost the same reward as the optimal trajectory with respect to \u03b8, then P (\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE |\u03b8) will be high. \u2022 reward-based6: d(\u03be\u03b8E , \u03be \u03b8\u2217 E ) = \u03b8 >\u03c6(\u03be\u03b8E)\u2212 \u03b8>\u03c6(\u03be\u03b8 \u2217 E ).\nThe second option depends not on reward, but on the physical trajectories. It assumes it is not high reward that can confuse people about whether the observed trajectory is optimal with respect to \u03b8, but rather physical proximity to the true optimal trajectory: this models people who cannot perfectly distinguish between perceptually-similar trajectories. \u2022 Euclidean-based: d(\u03be\u03b8E , \u03be \u03b8\u2217 E ) = 1 T \u2211T t=1 ||s\u03b8E,t \u2212 s\u03b8 \u2217\nE,t||2 where s\u03b8E,t is the state at time t for the trajectory \u03be \u03b8 E . Finally, a more conservative version of the Euclidean distance metric is the strategy-based metric. The idea here is that for any environment E, trajectories generated by candidate \u03b8s can be clustered into types, or strategies. The strategy-based metric assumes people do not distinguish among trajectories that follow the same strategy. For instance, people will consider all trajectories in which the robot speeds up and merges in front of the car to be equivalent, and all trajectories in\n5We noticed that normalizing this distribution produced very similar results to leaving it unnormalized, so that is what we do in our experiments, analogous to other algorithmic teaching work not based on reward functions [22].\n6Note that this is always positive because \u03be\u03b8E has maximal reward w.r.t. \u03b8.\nwhich the robot merges behind the car to be equivalent. So, if in environment E the example trajectory and the optimal trajectory with respect to \u03b8 have the same strategy, then P (\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE |\u03b8) \u221d 1. \u2022 strategy-based: d(\u03be\u03b8E , \u03be \u03b8\u2217 E ) = 0 if \u03be \u03b8 E and \u03be \u03b8\u2217\nE are in the same trajectory strategy cluster, \u221e otherwise.\nRelation to MaxEnt IRL. MaxEnt IRL [26] is an IRL algorithm that assumes demonstrations are noisy (i.e., not necessarily optimal). In our setting, we instead assume the learner is approximate. These two sources of noise result in the same model: the MaxEnt distribution is equivalent to our probabilistic reward-based model:\nP (\u03be\u03b8 \u2217 E |\u03b8) \u221d e\u03bb\u03b8 T\u03c6(\u03be\u03b8 \u2217 E ) (6)\n\u221d e\u03bb(\u03b8 T\u03c6(\u03be\u03b8\n\u2217 E )\u2212\u03b8\nT\u03c6(\u03be\u03b8E)) = e\u2212\u03bb\u00b7dr(\u03be \u03b8 E ,\u03be \u03b8\u2217 E ).

ANALYSIS OF APPROXIMATE INFERENCE MODELS WITH IDEAL USERS", "text": "In Sec. II-D, we introduced six possible approximateinference user models M. They all model people as judging candidate \u03b8s based on the distance between the trajectory they observed and the optimal trajectory with respect to \u03b8, but they differ in what the distance metric is, and whether they completely eliminate candidate \u03b8s (deterministic effect) or smoothly re-weight them (probabilistic effect).\nHere, we investigate how well algorithmic teaching with these models performs for teaching \u03b8\u2217 to ideal users. First, we generate a sequence of examples for each of our approximateinference models M, by greedily maximizing PM(\u03b8\u2217|\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE1:n ).\nWe also generate the sequence for the exact-inference model and include a random sequence, for a total of eight sequences. Types of Examples Selected. Fig. 3 summarizes the types of examples that each algorithm selected for its optimal sequence. The exact-inference model selects a single example, because that is enough to completely eliminate all other \u03b8s. This works well with an ideal user running exact inference, but our hypothesis is that it does not work as well with real users. Relative Evaluation. We evaluate algorithmic teaching on seven ideal users, whose learning exactly matches one of our six approximate-inference models or exact-inference IRL. We measure, for each \u201cuser\u201d M , the probability they assign to the correct objective function parameters, PM(\u03b8\u2217|\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE1:n ), given\n\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE1:n from each of the eight generated sequences.\nFig. 4 shows the results. First, we see for any ideal user M , the sequence generated by assuming a learner model M performs best at teaching that user. This is by design\u2014that sequence of examples is optimized to teach M .\nLooking across the columns of Fig. 4, we see all eight sequences perform equally well for teaching an exact IRL learner (column 1)\u2014even random, because it provides enough examples to perfectly eliminate all incorrect \u03b8s. This suggests exact IRL does not accurately model real users, whose performance likely varies based on which examples they see. Looking across the rows, we notice assuming a Euclidean distance approximation when generating examples (rows 3 and 6) leads to robust performance across different user models. Sec. V evaluates these generated sequences on real users.\nFinally, the random sequence is very uninformative for all ideal users except exact IRL, showing the utility of algorithmic teaching. We explore this utility with real users in Sec. VI."}, {"heading": "V. USER STUDY", "text": "We now evaluate whether approximate-inference models are useful with real, as opposed to ideal, users."}, {"heading": "A. Experiment Design", "text": "Manipulated Variables. We manipulate whether algorithmic teaching assumes exact-inference or approximate-inference. For the approximate-inference case, we manipulated two variables: the effect of approximate inference (either deterministic or probabilistic) and the distance metric (reward-based, Euclidean-based, or strategy-based), in a 2\u2013by\u20133 factorial design, for a total of six approximate inference models. For the strategy-based distance metric, the type of effect does not matter since distances are either 0 or \u221e, so there are five unique approximate-inference models.\nWe show the participant one training environment at a time, in the order that the examples were selected by each algorithm. Dependent Measures. In the end, we are interested in how well human participants learn a specific setting of reward parameters \u03b8\u2217 from the training examples. Since we cannot ask them to write down a \u03b8, or to drive according to how they think the car will drive (people can drive like themselves, but not so easily as others), we evaluate this by testing the participant\u2019s ability to identify the trajectory produced by \u03b8\u2217 in a few test environments. For each test environment, we show\nthe participant four trajectories and ask them to select the one that most closely matches the autonomous car\u2019s driving style.\nWe have two dependent variables that measure this: the fraction of participants who are able to identify \u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nEtest for\neach test environment Etest, and their confidence in selecting that trajectory. We combine them in a confidence score: the confidence if they are correct, negative of the confidence if they are not\u2014this score captures that if one is incorrect, it is better to be not confident about it.\nWe use rejection sampling to select test environments in which there are a wider variety of possible robot trajectories. We ensure the rewards of alternate trajectories under \u03b8\u2217 are below a reward-based distance threshold, to make sure the four trajectories do not look too similar. In order to not bias the measure, we select one test environment for each of the two trajectory strategy clusters in each of the three informative environment classes, for a total of six test environments. For each test environment, we show two trajectory options in each strategy cluster. Hypothesis. Accounting for approximate inference significantly improves performance (the confidence score). We leave open which approximate-inference models work well and which do not, since the goal is to identify which captures users\u2019 inferences the best. Subject Allocation. We used a between-subjects design, since examples of the same reward functions interfere with each other. We ran this experiment on a total of 191 participants across the six conditions, recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. At the end of the experiment, we ask participants what the two possible goals were, to filter out participants who were not paying attention. 30 out of 191 participants (15.7%) did not answer this control question correctly. The average age of the 161 non-filtered participants was 37.0 (SD = 11.0). The gender ratio was 0.46 female."}, {"heading": "B. Analysis", "text": "Number of Examples. Different algorithms produce different numbers of examples. Exact-inference IRL might produce as few as one example (and does in our case). Approximateinference models produce more, and random can produce an almost unlimited amount if allowed. Thus, a possible confound in our experiment is the number of examples.\nWe checked whether this is indeed a confound: do more examples help? Surprisingly, we found no correlation between the number of examples and performance: the sample Pearson correlation coefficient is r = 0.03 (Fig. 6, left). This suggests that example quantity matters less than example quality. Approximate-Inference Models. We start our analysis by comparing the different approximate-inference models. We ran a factorial ANOVA on confidence score with distance measure and determinism as factors (Fig. 5, left). We found a marginal effect for distance (F (2, 163) = 2.69, p = .07), with the Euclidean-based distance performing the best (as already suggested by our simulation experiment in Sec. IV, where Euclidean was the most robust across different ideal users), and the reward-based distance performing the worst.\nEuclidean-based might be better than reward-based because people decide to keep imperfect \u03b8s not when the trajectory\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0_5 0_6 0_4_2\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0_5 0_6 0_4_2\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0_5 0_6 0_4_2\nCo nfi\nde nc\ne Sc\nor e\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n*\napprox*\nexact inference IRL reward-based\nrandom coverage-random approx* coverage-approx*\n*\nEuclidean-based strategy-based probabilistic de te rm in ist ic\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nNo coverage, determeuc Coverage, determeuc\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nNo coverage, determeuc Coverage, determeuc\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nNo coverage, determeuc Coverage, determeuc\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0_2 0_3 0_4\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nNo coverage, random Coverage, random\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0_2 0_3 0_4\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nrando\nrando Fig. 5: Performance of human participants on ide tifying the autonomous car\u2019s trajectory in test environments, after seeing the example trajectories selected by the approximate-inference models (left) and after adding coverage (right) to the sequence of environments selected by the best-performing approximate-inference model, approx*.

Euclidean-based might be better than strategy-based because people differentiate between trajectories even when they follow the same strategy. For example, a trajectory that gets very close to another car would be in the same strategy class as a trajectory that stays farther away, as long as they both merge behind the other car, but these two trajectories may give people very different impressions of the car\u2019s driving style.\nThere was no effect for determinism. On average, prob-\nabilistic models performed ever-so-slightly worse than deterministic ones, and the difference was largest for Euclidean distance. This might be because keeping track of what is possible is easier than maintaining an entire probability distribution.\nThe best approximate-inference model used the Euclideanbased distance with deterministic effects. We refer to this as the approx* model (Fig. 5, left).\nResults for accuracy were analogous. Central Hypothesis: Utility of Approximate Inference. Despite showing more examples, most approximate-inference models did not perform much better than exact-inference IRL. This shows that not just any approximate-inference model is useful. However, it does not imply that no approximateinference model is useful. To test the utility of accounting for approximate inference, we compared the best model, approx*, with exact-inference IRL, and found a significant improvement (Welch\u2019s t-test p = 0.025).\nThis supports our central hypothesis of this paper, that accounting for approximate inference in our model of human inferences about objective functions helps, with the caveat that not just any type of approximation will work."}, {"heading": "VI. UTILITY OF ALGORITHMIC TEACHING", "text": "So far, we have tested our central hypothesis for this work, that accounting for approximate IRL inferences can indeed improve the performance of algorithmic teaching of humans. While this is very promising, we also wanted to test the utility of algorithmic teaching itself: whether this new algorithm is preferable not just to algorithmic teaching with exact inference, but to the robot not actively teaching. Instead, the person must learn from the robot\u2019s behavior in environments that it happens to encounter."}, {"heading": "A. Baselining Performance", "text": "Baseline Condition. We ran a follow-up study comparing algorithmic teaching with a sequence of optimal trajectories in random environments\u2014simulating that the robot does not choose these, but instead happens to encounter them. We recruited 33 users for this condition. The average age of the 28 non-filtered participants was 33.3 (SD = 9.6). The gender ratio was 0.46 female. Controlling for Confounds. There are several variables that could confound this study. First, when generating the random sequence, we might get very lucky or unlucky and generate a particularly informative or uninformative one. To avoid this, we randomly sample 1000 random sequences with the desired number of examples, and sort them based on PM(\u03b8\u2217|\u03be\u03b8 \u2217\nE1:n )\nwhere M is the exact-inference IRL model. Then we choose the median sequence in that ranking as our random sequence, which will have median informativeness.\nSecond, different algorithms produce different numbers of examples. For instance, exact-inference IRL only selects one example, which eliminates all \u03b8s other than \u03b8\u2217\u2014because in that environment the optimal trajectories for all \u03b8s are at least slightly different than that for \u03b8\u2217. To give the random baseline the best chance, we choose to select eight environments for it, which is the maximum number of examples shown by any of the other conditions. Since the majority of environments are\nuninformative (i.e., not in the merging, braking, or tailgating classes), providing the random condition with eight environments is needed to not put it at a serious disadvantage. Analysis. Algorithmic teaching with our approximate inference model did outperform the random baseline, albeit not significantly (Welch\u2019s t-test p = 0.23 when comparing participants\u2019 confidence scores). Algorithmic teaching without accounting for approximate inference actually seems to perform poorly compared to random (Fig. 5, right). Coverage. Digging deeper, we realized users tended to perform well on test cases for strategies in which they had seen a training example. In addition, for each pair of environment strategies A and B (e.g., merge-in-front and merge-behind), if users did not see an example from strategy A but saw one from strategy B, their performance was worse than if they did not see any examples from either A or B! In other words, if users see one trajectory strategy in the training examples and not the opposite strategy, they tend to think the autonomous car will always take the first strategy in that environment type.\nBased on this observation, given that x training examples are shown in environment class A and y from B, we define the number of helpful environments shown in A as equal to x if x > 0, and equal to \u2212y otherwise. We found a strong correlation between the number of \u201chelpful\u201d environments shown and users\u2019 confidence scores, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.83 (p = 1.4\u00d7 10\u221211) (Fig. 6, right).\nWe leverage this result to introduce augmented algorithms that ensure coverage of strategies."}, {"heading": "B. Coverage-Augmented Algorithmic Teaching", "text": "Since coverage correlates with better user performance, we add a coverage term to our optimization over trajectories \u03be\u03b8\u2217E1:n :\narg max \u03be\u03b8\u2217E1:n\nPM(\u03b8 \u2217|\u03be\u03b8\u2217E1:n) + \u03bb \u2211 c 1[\u2203i, h(\u03be\u03b8\u2217Ei) = c], (9)\nwhere the sum is over trajectory strategy clusters c and the function h maps a trajectory to the strategy it belongs to.\nWe set the trade-off parameter \u03bb at 0 until [PM(\u03b8\u2217|\u03be\u03b8\u2217E1:t)\u2212 PM(\u03b8\n\u2217|\u03be\u03b8\u2217E1:t\u22121)] < , so that first the examples that maximize the probability of \u03b8\u2217 will be selected, and only after no further examples will significantly improve the probability of \u03b8\u2217, extra examples are selected to provide coverage across the strategies. We select these extra examples by choosing the best with respect to the approximate-inference model M, to make sure they are informative. Using this approach, we augment our best approximate-inference model, approx*, to achieve coverage."}, {"heading": "C. User Study on Coverage", "text": "We next run a study to test the benefit of coverage. Manipulated Variables. We manipulate two variables: whether we augmented the training examples with coverage, and whether we used a user model to generate the examples or sampled uniformly. We select our best model for the former, approx*. From the previous experiment, we have already obtained user performance data along the no-coverage dimension\u2014for random and approx*\u2014so we run this experiment on only the two new conditions that incorporate coverage, which we will refer to as coverage-random and coverageapprox*. We generate random sequences with coverage by\nrandomly selecting exactly one random environment from each of the eight environment and trajectory strategy classes. Dependent Measures. We keep the same dependent measures as in our previous Mechanical Turk experiment (Sec. V-A). Hypothesis. We hypothesize coverage augmentation improves user performance in both conditions, random and approx*, compared to the respective conditions without coverage. Subject Allocation. We ran this experiment between-subjects, on a total of 63 participants across the two conditions. The average age of the 53 non-filtered participants was 34.43 (SD = 9.0). The gender ratio was 0.53 female. Analysis. We ran a factorial ANOVA on confidence score with coverage and model as factors. We found a marginal effect for coverage (F (1, 107) = 1.82, p = .07), suggesting that coverage improves performance. There was no interaction effect, suggesting that coverage helps regardless of using a user model for teaching or not.\nCoverage-approx* performed best out of the four conditions. The coverage augmentation enabled it to significantly outperform the random baseline (with a Welch\u2019s ttest p = 0.049), which suggests coverage is useful. Coverage augmentation did not enable the coverage-random condition to outperform the random baseline (p = 0.159), which suggests the approximate-inference model is useful (Fig. 5, right).\nOverall, coverage alone helped, but was not sufficient to outperform the baseline. From the previous experiment, we know that the approximate-inference user model helped, but was also not sufficient to outperform the baseline. Overall, the improvement is largest (and significant, modulo compensating for multiple hypotheses) when we have a coverage-augmented approximate-inference IRL model.\nWhen leveraged together, coverage with the right approximate-inference model have a significant teaching advantage over random teaching, as well as over IRL models that assume exact-inference users."}, {"heading": "VII. DISCUSSION", "text": "Summary. We take a step towards communicating robot objectives to people. We found that an approximate-inference model using a deterministic Euclidean-based update on the space of candidate reward function parameters performed best at teaching real users, and outperforms algorithmic teaching that assumes exact inference. We additionally found after augmenting such model with a coverage objective, it significantly outperformed letting the user passively familiarize to the robot. Limitations and Future Work. Our results reveal the promise of algorithmic teaching of robot objective functions. Our model of human learning is far from perfect, and more work is needed to explore the process people use to extrapolate from observed robot behavior.\nFurthermore, in this work we focused on the robot\u2019s physical behavior as a communication channel because people naturally infer utility functions from it. Future work could augment this with other channels, for instance visualizations of the objective function or language-based explanations."}, {"heading": "VIII.

correctly anticipate a robot\u2019s behavior in novel situations. This behavior is often a direct result of the robot\u2019s underlying objective function. Our insight is that end-users need to have an accurate mental model of this objective function in order to understand and predict what the robot will do. While people naturally develop such a mental model over time through observing the robot act, this familiarization process may be lengthy. Our approach reduces this time by having the robot model how people infer objectives from observed behavior, and then selecting those behaviors that are maximally informative. The problem of computing a posterior over objectives from observed behavior is known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and has been applied to robots learning human objectives. We consider the problem where the roles of human and robot are swapped. Our main contribution is to recognize that unlike robots, humans will not be exact in their IRL inference. We thus introduce two factors to define candidate approximateinference models for human learning in this setting, and analyze them in a user study in the autonomous driving domain. We show that certain approximate-inference models lead to the robot generating example behaviors that better enable users to anticipate what the robot will do in test situations. Our results also suggest, however, that additional research is needed in modeling how humans extrapolate from examples of robot behavior.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
