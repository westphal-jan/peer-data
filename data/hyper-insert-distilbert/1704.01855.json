On the contrary, there has recently been an explosion of interest in using the Web to create, assemble, and disseminate geographic information provided voluntarily by individuals. Crowd mapping activity, combining the aggregation of a Geographic Information System (maps on the Web) and crowd-generated content, flourishes daily [1, 2]. Sites such as Wikimapia (http://www.wikimapia.com), WikiCrimes (http://www.wikicrimes.org) [3], Click2fix (http://www.click2fix.co.sa), Crowdmap (www.crowdmap.com), and OpenStreetMap (http://www.openstreetmap.org) are empowering citizens to create a global patchwork\nof geographic information, while Google Earth and other virtual globes are encouraging volunteers to develop interesting applications using their own data. In crowd map applications, the digital map works as a blackboard for accommodating stories told by people about events they want to share with others typically participating in their social networks.\nOn the other hand, although there are increasingly more initiatives for the generation of semantic knowledge based on user participation (e.g.: twine, semantic wiki [4], and ontowiki [5]), there is still a shortage of platforms for the development of applications by non-expert users on which semantic data can be generated automatically and exploited by these applications.\nOur work fits innovatively into this context. We propose a service-oriented architecture, called SeMaps (from Semantic Maps), for expressing the semantics of what the designer of the map intends to mark on the map (here called markers). We call \u201csemantic characterization\u201d the act of describing the concept(s) that best represent(s) a marker. The characterized concepts are associated with the linked data represented in RDF. In doing so, SeMaps makes it possible to generate Semantic Crowd Maps that have the power to perform inferences and/or access external sources that constitute useful and appropriate information to the map context. Wikipedia itself \u2013 through its RDF representation in DBpedia [6] \u2013 can be one of these external sources that provide additional and contextual information within the map.\nIn this paper we describe the architecture of SeMaps, with an emphasis on the specification of its own ontologies as well as its connection with Linked Open Data (LOD). Then we describe how the SeMaps services were coupled to a crowd mapping authoring tool in order to drive the marker\u2019s concept elicitation from the commonsense base in order to define the semantic value of what the designer wishes to mark on the map. An example of a crowd map generated from this approach demonstrates how easy the process of attributing semantics and accessing LOD in crowd maps can be."}, {"heading": "2 Providing Semantics to Crowd Maps", "text": "At the core of SeMaps are the ontologies that describe the knowledge behind the maps created. Due to the collaboration characteristic inherent in the maps, we sought to reuse concepts of ontology that supported the collaborative model of content creation. We found the support we needed in the Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities (SIOC) ontology [7]. In addition to describing the content created by the participants, it also provides the possibility of adding semantics to such content, an important part of our model. In the SeMaps ontology, the marker has information about an event, a person, a business or a particular fact (represented by the concept classes created during the process of marker creation) and on the marker per se (such as date and time, the user who created it, among others). Moreover, in the marker there is a set of features to describe the provenance of the information, such as the type of source and how reliable it is. For representing these latter features, we imported the PML2 (Proof Markup Language) ontology [8]. However, we specialized\nsome of the concepts to cope with the particular features of representing the notion of reputation inspired in [ the main classes of SeMaps\n\u2022 Marker \u2013 the class responsible for describing a domain of the map at who reports and the \u2022 WikiUser/WikiUser crowd map.

As Se-\ncomm-\ndub\nSeMaps allows the generated maps to have completely heterogeneous domains. Therefore, there is a need to describe types of information that exist only for a speci ic map. A particular map can refer to crimes, noise pollution, humanitarian assistance, etc. Each map contains specific information that must be described. To enable this specialized description, OWL classes are created on demand, i.e., tion evolves according to the map created. These classes are extracted directly from the markers created on the various crowd maps and are images of the erty. As previously mentioned, the instances of these classes are linked to a concept through the rdf:type property.\nBesides using the aforementioned knowledge base, which expresses inferentialist semantic and common ledge \u2013 InferenceNet [12]. that connects a concept to many others through dozens of common relations and that are inferential in nature (preconditions and postconditions of the use of concepts). Formally, this base is represented in a directed graph inferential relationship where relationName is the name of an PropertyOf, EffectOf, type = \u201cPre\u201d or \u201cPos\u201d, indicating a precondition or a postcondition for using the co cept ci.\nInferenceNet is linked to YAGO and DBpedia [13] to be made, since the base expresses common import of the concepts in the reasoning.\nSeMaps represent\nsioc:topic\nontologies, SeMaps services rely on a\n-sense kno InferenceNet expresses semantic content through a network\n-sense semantic\nGc(C, rcj \u2208 Rc is represented by a tuple (relationName, ci, InferenceNet semantic relation (Capableof, etc.), ci and ck \u2208 C are concepts of a natural language, and\n, which allows rich inferences -sense knowledge and the inferential\nf-\na-\nprop-\nbilingual w-\nRc).

The main features are: description of crowd maps in an RDF/OWL ontology, web services for semantically characterizing a maker, and web service for LOD contextualized resources retrieval from data already on the map. Figure 2 shows the SeMaps architecture and its relation with a crowd map."}, {"heading": "3.1 Semantic Characterization Module", "text": "The module for semantic characterization comprises the services by which the user-designer can define the semantic value s/he wishes to mark on the map (the marker) based on the common-sense base. In short, the user-designer, by informing a linguistic expression that designates its marker, is guided in a process that aims to associate a concept from the common-sense base to the linguistic expression that names the marker. Thus, the map starts to have dominion over common-sense inferential relations that define the meaning of the marker and are able to make inferences about the network of linked data. SeMaps provides services to associate a concept to a marker and to create an ontology for the crowd map.\nThe association of a concept to a marker is an iterative process that occurs while there are markers to be created by the designer. Figure 3 describes the interface of the WS (SemanticCharacterization) with its methods and I/O parameters. The semanticCharacterize method receives as a parameter the string that describes a marker and\nreturns a list of URIs that identify resources found in the common-sense base represented in RDF.\nFor each marker with an associated concept, SeMaps uses another service to create the classes of the ontology for this map. The instances of the classes are linked to DBpedia/YAGO. Figure 4 describes the interface of the Concepts WS. The input parameter of the createConcept method is the string that describes the marker and returns a unique identifier for the concept. This number is the main reference of the concept in SeMaps."}, {"heading": "3.2 LOD Search Module", "text": "The search module of SeMaps provides a service that obtains resources (articles, news, etc.) from LOD. This search is based on the semantic characterization done in the module described in 3.1. The searchLODForConcept method of the LOD WS receives a concept representing a marker as input and returns a list of URIs describing resources related to the concept. Usually the algorithms that implement this search also use InferenceNet. An example of this was described in [14]. The URIs returned by the method can be used in different ways, for instance, used as a widget or plotted directly on the map. Due to space constraints, the web service description in WSDL was omitted."}, {"heading": "3.3 D2R Endpoint", "text": "SeMaps assumes the use of a service of mapping relational data to RDF. This is necessary not only to avoid data replication, since typically the authoring tools have their data represented in RDBs, but also because the crowd map data will be available to be accessed by a SPARQL endpoint. We used the D2R server [15], which is an open and free system for publishing relational data on the Web. It enables RDF and HTML browsers to navigate the content of non-RDF databases, and allows applications to query a database using the SPARQL query language over the SPARQL protocol.\n4 Integrating SeMaps into WikiMapps\nThe SeMaps architecture allows several different implementations for each service. For example, different algorithms for semantic annotation can be used in the process of semantic characterization. The only requirement that must be satisfied is to follow the interface specified previously.\nIn order to put SeMaps to work, we integrated the SeMaps services for semantic characterization of a marker into Wikimapps (www.wikimapps.com), an authoring tool for creating and hosting crowd maps. The semantic characterization process and the search module were instantiated with algorithms described in [14].\nWe also used a D2R Server to maintain the map ontology. Thus, for each marker created in the authoring tool, SeMaps creates an entry in this table and a mapping in D2RQ helps to automatically update the ontology.\nTo exemplify how the knowledge represented on a crowd map generated from Wikimapps works, let\u2019s assume that a designer wants to create a map of politicians of a certain region. In order to associate semantics to the markers, Wikimapps was prepared to call the services for semantic characterization and concept creation of SeMaps. Thus, when the designer of a crowd map in Wikimapps defines a marker called \u201cpolitician\u201d, it is automatically associated with InferenceNet\u2019s \u201cpolitician\u201d concept that, in turn, is linked to instances of YAGO and DBpedia. The way each service of this process was implemented is described in [14].\nThe crowd map generated by Wikimapps was also prepared to use a SeMaps search WS. This service was called inside a widget that brings LOD data from the New York Times and DBpedia, with additional information related to subjects to which the markers of the map refer. The widget calls the WS whenever there is a change in the map\u2019s viewport.\nFigure 5 presents the results of a query made by the crowd map, whereby news from the New York Times on corruption, scandals and laws has been found. Note that this information refers to the region the map selected (in this case the state of Illinois).\nFigure 5 also shows links representing the relations of common sense that have been identified. If the user decides to navigate the map, other queries are performed, this time filtering information regarding relationships as news stories on laws proposed by politicians, corruption, or any scandals. In the example shown in Figure 5, the possible issues were created by the inferential content of the concept \u201cpolitician\u201d, expressed in InferenceNet: \u201ca politician is able to propose laws\u201d and \u201ca politician has the capacity to corrupt.\u201d This common-sense knowledge is expressed in InferenceNet through the relationships (CapableOf, \u201cpolitician\u201d, \u201cto propose laws\u201d, \u201cPre\u201d) and (ProprietyOf, \u201cpolitician\u201d, \u201ccorruption\u201d, \u201cPre\u201d), respectively. Moreover, the concepts \u201cpolitical\u201d, \u201claw\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d are associated \u2013 via LOD \u2013 with YAGO resources and DBpedia. Also in Figure 5, we see another characteristic obtained by the fact of knowing the semantics of the concept: DBpedia articles are related to the location indicated on the map. Further information regarding the place of birth, death, work and other references that are based on GeoNames allow WikiMapps to automatically sort the items for these characteristics."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "The production of linked open data is a growing trend on the web. Thus, the number of tools for generating semantic content on the Web is increasing. Highlighted among these tools are those that export pre-existing data without semantics, such as Drupal [16].\nLinkedGeoData [17] is a project aimed at processing and representation of RDF data that was created collaboratively in OpenStreetMap (OSM \u2013 www.openstreetmap.org). In addition, the project aims to allow binding of OSM with other bases of the LOD. LinkedGeoData developed an ontology partly derived from the relational schema coming from OpenStreetMap and WGS84 (World Geodetic\nSystem). To map the collected data in instances of the OSM ontology, LinkedGeoData makes use of Triplify, a tool able to accomplish mapping from relational databases to RDF. Despite the similarities with SeMaps, LinkedGeoData is focused on the geographic elements that compose the map instead of modeling denounces, events, persons and other entities that are associated to places. This is not a disadvantage of LinkedGeoData, but shows how it is focused on collaborative cartography and it is not able to cover what SeMaps covers, like events or complaints, for instance.\nAnother group of tools that produce semantic content is that of semantic wikis. The semantic wikis, such as Semantic MediaWiki [4], allow the users themselves to describe \u2013 through notes \u2013 the content edited by them. Although they allow semantic data to be generated collaboratively, semantic wikis tend to make the process of creation somewhat difficult for users, since they need to use special tags in order for the data to be linked semantically. This difficulty can result in data linked erroneously or without sufficient links. Some projects such as Wolfram Alpha (www.wolframalpha.com) aim to provide a \u201ccomputational knowledge engine\u201d and allow the generation of knowledge widgets that are very similar to the services that can be produced using the services provided by SeMaps. However, a proprietary knowledge base is used, exploring alternative representational ways that could eventually support or complement our approach.\nHermes [18] is a system capable of creating a knowledge base and from there, filtering news from RSS feeds in accordance with the desired concepts. It compiles an ontology with linguistic expressions that appear in the selected news items. By creating a knowledge base on top of news, the proposed framework does not use a knowledge base of common sense as we do in SeMaps."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we propose the semantic crowd map concept, in which the process of participation and interaction always occurs in relation to a given space indicated on a digital map and the semantic of the marker is provided by services of SeMaps. We describe a platform for creating semantic crowd maps, which provides an environment for the creation and maintenance of sites based on crowd maps. We seek to supply the lack of platforms for the development of applications, by non-specialist users, where semantic data are automatically generated and exploited by these applications.\nSeMaps allows a user who wishes to create a crowd map to do so with the description of the concept of that which s/he wishes to mark on the map. Hence, the maps produced by SeMaps have the power to make inferences and access external sources that constitute useful information, appropriate to the context of the map. This semantic characterization of the marker used a common-sense base in Portuguese and English. The integration of SeMaps into Wikimapps showed that crowd maps generated by WikiMapps are more informative, since before SeMaps they only were able to show what people marked on the map and nothing more. With SeMaps, they are able to access LOD and show relevant and contextualized information."}, {"heading": "7 References", "text": "1.

We propose an architecture, called Semantic Maps (SeMaps), for assisting the authoring and hosting of applications in which the maps combine the aggregation of a Geographic Information System and crowd-generated content (called here crowd maps). In these systems, the digital map works as a blackboard for accommodating stories told by people about events they want to share with others typically participating in their social networks. SeMaps offers an environment for the creation and maintenance of sites based on crowd maps with the possibility for the user to characterize semantically that which s/he intends to mark on the map. The designer of a crowd map, by informing a linguistic expression that designates what has to be marked on the maps, is guided in a process that aims to associate a concept from a common-sense base to this linguistic expression. Thus, the crowd maps start to have dominion over common-sense inferential relations that define the meaning of the marker, and are able to make inferences about the network of linked data. This makes it possible to generate maps that have the power to perform inferences and access external sources (such as DBpedia) that constitute information that is useful and appropriate to the context of the map. In this paper we describe the architecture of SeMaps and how it was applied in a crowd map au-", "creator": "PDFCreator Version 0.9.8"}}}
