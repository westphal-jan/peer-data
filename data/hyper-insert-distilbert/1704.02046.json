INTRODUCTION", "text": "Frequency modulation (FM) radio broadcasting is commonly used for transmitting audio signal representing voice. However, the detection reliability severely deteriorates for weak signal components and low input SNR. However, FM performance is severely degraded when the system noise levels exceeds a critical level, above this critical point the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases significantly, this phenomenon is known as Threshold Effect. Due to the threshold effect the detection of the information signal is poor, as a result the intelligibility and quality of the transmitted speech decreases significantly. A supervised method, based on deep neural networks (DNNs), to demodulate and enhance the speech signal is proposed. This method permits a more accurate signal reconstruction under interference in the transmission channel under a low SNR noise conditions. For the case of low noise this method achieves slightly worse performance then traditional FM demodulator which uses prior knowledge on the transmission method. Moreover, with the availability of sufficient computation power the suggested method can decode the signal with real time constraints and can be used as an extremely robust radio receiver."}, {"heading": "2. PROBLEM FORMULATION", "text": "FM, is a form of modulation in which the information message or speech signal is encoded by varying the frequency of a carrier wave. In this form of modulation the instantaneous frequency deviation i.e. the difference between the frequency of the transmitted wave and its carrier frequency, is proportional to the modulating speech signal. In communication systems, statistic model for the channel is usually assumed to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Therefore, receivers are usually designed for this channel. However, real world communication systems, may need to perform under low SNR conditions, highly non-stationary noise environments and unknown channel model and channel statistics. Under the above conditions the perceived signal quality is severely degraded, and existing communication systems fail to properly suppress interferences in such conditions. For those conditions achieving high speech intelligibility is a very challenging and important problem. As mentioned optimal signal estimation algorithms are usually constructed on basis of statistical properties of measurement process and prior statistical or deterministic model of reconstructed signals. This is often a hard problem with no analytic solution, which can be solved only approximately based on simplistic models of noise and signal. On the other hand, any signal estimation can be considered as a non-linear mapping from input data to the desired output. Having a universal function approximation tool in hand, we can learn such a mapping using set of training examples, pairs of input measurements and desired output signals. As the size of training set and the capacity of the approximator grow, we get more and more close to an optimal nonlinear estimator (see e.g. [2, 3, 4]) LSTM recurrent neural network is a very powerful model for varying-length sequential data, achieving state-of-theart results for many problems spanning natural language processing, image captioning, handwriting recognition and audio generation. Given quality of approximation it usually requires smaller number of free parameters (weights) than other approximation schemes. In many\nsignal estimation tasks advantage of LSTM becomes significant only when there is a statistical dependency between the examples. In our research we use deep neural network (DNN) for the problem of source signal estimation from noisy frequency-modulated measurements. In particular, we are interested in optimal recovery of speech signals."}, {"heading": "3. METHOD DESCRIPTION", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1. Dataset and training procedure", "text": "In order to alleviate the computational demands we are only working on the baseband signal, conversion to baseband from intermediate frequency can be performed by another digital or analog hardware. The training set is generated using Matlab FM modulation from comm Package with the following properties: Peak deviation of the output signal frequency 75 KHz and sampling frequency of the modulated signal is 240 KHz. The audio that was used was downloaded from freesound.org is the famous \"rally the troops\" speech from Shakespeare's play Henry V which has a total duration of 3:30 sec, the audio was filtered by low pass filter with cutoff frequency of 4 KHz. 90 % of the speech was used for training and the remaining 10% was used as test set For the input of the neural network we use two features a samples of the in phase and samples quadrature components of the baseband signal, For the output of the neural network we take the four samples of the message (audio) signal corresponding to the same time frame as the sliding window. In our experiments we have used a window length of 60 samples of in phase component and 60 samples of the quadrature component, although in general the constraint of the window size depends on the sampling rate of the audio signal."}, {"heading": "3.2. Architecture", "text": "The following neural network architecture was proposed: Two input features consisting of a sequence of size 60 each, for the real and imaginary parts of the baseband signal are fed into an LSTM layer with 60 neurons, the output of this network feeds into another LSTM layer with 120 neurons and finally a fully connected feed forward neural network with four outputs was added."}, {"heading": "4. RELATED WORK", "text": "Traditionally radio transmission decoding and speech enhancement are considered as two separate problems. Except for the traditional methods for radio transmission decoding and for minimum mean square error (MMSE)based speech enhancement techniques, several, though not many, neural networks based methods have been proposed for each of the two above problems separately. For example for the radio demodulation application: M. Amini et al. \"Universal Neural Network Demodulator for Software Defined Radio\"[5], kamyar rohani et al. \"The design of multilayer perceptrons using building blocks\"[6]. Though none of the above have presented a good results for FM demodulator case. Also a new work by Yong Xu et al [7], is suggesting a DNN-based speech enhancement system. To the best of our knowledge, there are no works similar to our research proposal, employing a regression DNN model for radio transmission decoding with the prior knowledge of transmitted speech messages. Also the network architectures that were used are fullyconnected and no loopback was used i.e. no use of recurrent neural network was made"}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "For FM modulated signal we are comparing the performance against Matlab modulation using FM method which is based on [8].\nIn both cases the modulated signal sample rate is set to 240 KHz and the frequency deviation is set to 75 KHz.\nWe will next present the network performance against standard demodulation for various levels of AWGN. For the case of color noise we assume that the network can learn noise statistics and it will give even a larger improvement in performance. For each noise level the network was re trained with a new dataset with the same noise level."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have presented a new approach to decode FM transmission of audio speech signals which utilizes deep learning and more specifically LSTM. Building an SDR based on neural networks for such sizes became practical only recently with appearance of powerful graphical processing units (GPU) and corresponding software. The audio signal quality estimation is also not in the scope of this work, and need to be considered in future research."}, {"heading": "7. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] Y. Levy, V. Ovcharenko and D.
