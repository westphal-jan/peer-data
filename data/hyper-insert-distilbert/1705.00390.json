In particular, this task sought to augment WordNet1 with senses that are present in another dictionary. Task 14 drew glosses of words not found in WordNet from a variety of sources that will collectively be referred to as OtherDict in this paper.\nThe method the Duluth systems took was based on scoring overlaps between WordNet and OtherDict glosses. A OtherDict sense was assigned to the WordNet sense with the highest overlapping score. Overlaps are defined to be exact matches between words and phrases in the glosses. Each overlap is assigned a score that is the square of the number of words in the overlap, and then all the overlaps between a pair of glosses is summed to provide the final score.\n1http://wordnet.princeton.edu\nThe premise of relying on overlaps is that senses that are defined using many of the same words are certainly related, and indeed if they are defined using the same words they are likely synonyms. This is a well established and reliable intuition that goes back at least to (Lesk, 1986). Closely related words that may not be synonyms (such as hyponyms or hypernyms) will use many of the same words in their definitions, but then have specific differentia that distinguishes among them.\nTask 14 asked participants to distinguish between merging a OtherDict sense into an existing WordNet synset (i.e, a synonym) or attaching it as a hyponym (i.e., a more specific example) of a WordNet sense. However, our systems only merge OtherDict senses into WordNet synsets. It seems clear though that this merge versus attach problem can be tackled by setting some kind of threshold for the amount of overlap, where more significant degrees of overlap should result in a synonym merge whereas less overlap could indicate a hyponym attach. As yet we have not been successful in determining a reliable method for finding such a threshold. As a result we simply assumed every OtherDict sense would attach to its closest (most overlapping) WordNet sense.\nEach Duluth system carried out the same pre-processing on both the WordNet and OtherDict glosses. In addition, the WordNet glosses were extended using additional information from WordNet such as the glosses of its hypernyms, hyponyms, derived forms, and meronyms. This follows naturally from the structure of WordNet and the intuitions that underlie the Extended Gloss Overlap measure (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003b),\nwhich is implemented in WordNet::Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004) and UMLS::Similarity (McInnes et al., 2009). Unfortunately there was not time to expand the OtherDict glosses in similar ways, although this is at least a possibility since some other dictionaries (such as Wiktionary) provide hyponyms and hypernyms, among other relations.\nTask 14 allowed two kinds of systems to participate : resource\u2013aware that only used dictionary content, and constrained that used other resources beyond dictionaries. The Duluth systems are considered resource\u2013aware since they only use information from WordNet and OtherDict."}, {"heading": "2 Systems", "text": "All the Duluth systems start by pre\u2013processing both WordNet and OtherDict glosses. This consists of removing any character that is not alphanumeric, and then converting all remaining characters to lower case. Compounds known to WordNet are identified in the WordNet glosses, but not as it turns out in the OtherDict glosses. This very likely reduced the number of overlaps we found since a WordNet compound such as light year will not match light year, which is the form that would occur in OtherDict.\nIn the following sections we describe the Duluth systems. Since the only distinction between them is how they reconstruct WordNet glosses we will provide a running example to illustrate each system. We will use the noun feline#n#1 for this purpose. The original WordNet entry for this sense (prior to pre\u2013 processing) is shown here :\n\u2022 feline#n#1 \u2013 (any of various lithe-bodied\nroundheaded fissiped mammals, many with retractile claws)\n\u2022 hypernym : carnivore \u2013 (a terrestrial or aquatic\nflesh-eating mammal; \u201cterrestrial carnivores have four or five clawed digits on each limb\u201d)\n\u2022 hyponym1 : cat, true cat \u2013 (feline mammal usu-\nally having thick soft fur and no ability to roar: domestic cats; wildcats)\n\u2022 hyponym2 : big cat, cat \u2013 (any of several large\ncats typically able to roar and living in the wild)\n\u2022 meronym : feline \u2013 (a clawed foot of an animal\nespecially a quadruped)\n\u2022 derived : feline#a#1 \u2013 (of or relating to cats;\n\u201cfeline fur\u201d)\nThe Duluth systems build upon each other to some extent, so they are presented in an order that more easily illustrates those connections rather than their numeric order (which has no particular significance)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Duluth2", "text": "Duluth2 is the most basic of the Duluth systems. Each WordNet sense is represented by its gloss where all stop words and single character words have been removed. The stoplist comes from the Ngram Statistics Package (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003a) and includes 392 words2.\nTo continue our example, the first noun sense of feline is represented by Duluth2 as shown below - it has simply gone through pre\u2013processing and then had stop words removed.\n\u2022 feline#n#1 : lithe bodied roundheaded fissiped\nmammals retractile claws\nThis system represents a baseline for the overlap measures, since we are comparing the original WordNet and OtherDict glosses after having done minimal pre\u2013processing."}, {"heading": "2.2 Duluth1", "text": "Duluth1 is a natural extension of Duluth2, where each WordNet gloss is expanded by concatenating to it (in the following order) : the glosses of the hypernyms of the sense3, the glosses of all the hyponyms of the sense, the glosses of any derived form of the sense, and the glosses of all the meronyms of the sense. This significantly expands the size of each WordNet gloss, to the point where our initial attempts to simply use these extended glosses in matching took too much time to finish during the available window of time for the evaluation. We\n2http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/TPEDERSE/Text-NSP-\n1.31/bin/utils/stoplist-nsp.regex 3In general each sense has only one hypernym, although this is not always true in WordNet.\nwere also concerned about the significant disparities in size among WordNet glosses, and of course with the unexpanded OtherDict glosses.\nAs a result we decided to shorten the WordNet glosses in Duluth1 by removing any word that is made up of four characters or less (rather than using a stoplist), and then only taking the first nine words in the expanded gloss. For many words this means that just the original gloss and the gloss of the hypernym and perhaps part of the gloss of a hyponym would be included. The OtherDict glosses were processed in a similar fashion, where any word with 4 or fewer characters was removed.\nOur running example is shown below. Note that this is quite similar to Duluth2, except that various is included below (but was excluded in Duluth2 since it is in the stoplist), and that terrestrial is included (since it is the first word in the gloss of the hyponym).\n\u2022 feline#n#1 : various lithe bodied roundheaded\nfissiped mammals retractile claws terrestrial"}, {"heading": "2.3 Duluth4", "text": "Note that Duluth4 was not included in our official evaluation. Rather this was run after the evaluation period, and it proved to be our most accurate result. Duluth4 is similar to Duluth1 in that it expands the WordNet glosses, but only does so with the glosses of its hypernyms and hyponyms (and does not include the derivational forms or meronyms, as Duluth1 does). Stop words are removed using the same list as Duluth2.\nWe can see in our running example that this provides a larger gloss, but it is not as large as what Duluth1 provided (before pruning it back to just the first nine words).\n\u2022 feline#n#1 : lithe bodied roundheaded fissiped\nmammals retractile claws terrestrial aquatic flesh eating mammal terrestrial carnivores four five clawed digits limb feline mammal having thick soft fur ability roar domestic cats wildcats several large cats typically able roar living wild"}, {"heading": "2.4 Duluth3", "text": "There are many minor variations between words in WordNet and OtherDict glosses, and it is difficult\nto normalize the glosses in order to eliminate them. Instead, we decided to have one system that relied on character tri-grams, since that could allow for matches between portions of words, rather than requiring the exact matches that all the other Duluth systems insist upon.\nDuluth3 expands each WordNet gloss with the gloss of its hypernyms and its hyponyms (like Duluth4, although stop words are not eliminated in Duluth3). Then all spaces are removed from each expanded gloss, and it is broken into three character ngrams. Glosses were limited to 250 of these trigrams, mainly so that they could finish running in the available time during the evaluation.\nIf one studies the running example carefully you can reconstruct the gloss, which is similar to Duluth4 except that it includes stop words.\n\u2022 feline#n#1 : any ofv ari ous lit heb odi edr oun\ndhe ade dfi ssi ped mam mal sma nyw ith ret rac til ecl aws ate rre str ial ora qua tic fle she ati ngm amm alt err est ria lca rni vor esh ave fou ror fiv ecl awe ddi git son eac hli mbf eli nem amm alu sua lly hav ing thi cks oft fur and noa bil ity tor oar dom est icc ats wil dca tsa nyo fse ver all arg eca tst ypi cal lya ble tor oar and liv ing int hew ild"}, {"heading": "3 Results and Discussion", "text": "Despite seemingly significant differences in how the WordNet glosses were expanded, Table 1 reveals that there were only minor differences in results among Duluth1, Duluth2, and Duluth3.

Recall that Duluth1 normalized gloss lengths by taking only the first nine words in the expanded glosses, and that Duluth3 attempted a kind of poor man\u2019s stemming by using character trigrams.\nDuluth4 is an obvious extension of Duluth2, in that it expands glosses with their hypernym and hyponyms. This results in a modest but significant improvement on the systems submitted for the formal evaluation, and suggests that focusing on expanded gloss content in relatively straightforward ways can pay dividends. This system at least begins to approach the median score attained by the systems participating in the task. That said, even this result considerably lags the baseline First Word (Jurgens and Pilehvar, 2015) provided by the organizers.\nTable 2 shows the results of additional experiments were carried out with Duluth1. Here the gloss sizes were varied from 1 to 100, where 9 is the value used during the formal evaluation. Note that the size of the OtherDict glosses was always 5,533 (tokens) and that the recall attained was always 1.00.\nTable 2 shows that generally speaking increasing the number of words in the WordNet glosses results in a small but steady improvement in performance. However, it is important to keep in mind that as the WordNet glosses are growing, the OtherDict glosses are fixed at the same size. This seems to make it clear that the most important avenue moving forward is to expand the OtherDict glosses with additional content, comparable to that with which Word-\nNet is expanded."}, {"heading": "4 System Implementation Details", "text": "The Duluth systems are implemented using UMLS::Similarity, which provides measures of semantic relatedness and similarity for the Unified Medical Language System.
