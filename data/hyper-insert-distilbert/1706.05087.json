Word-level NMT systems can suffer from problems with rare words(Gulcehre et al., 2016) or data sparsity, and the existence of compound words without explicit segmentation in certain language pairs can make learning alignments and translations more difficult. Character-level neural machine translation mitigates these issues.\nIn this work we propose to augment the encoderdecoder model for character-level NMT by integrating a planning mechanism. Specifically, we develop a model that uses planning to improve the alignment between input and output sequences. Our model\u2019s encoder is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that\n\u2217Equal Contribution\nreads the source (a sequence of byte pairs representing text in some language) and encodes it as a sequence of vector representations; the decoder is a second RNN that generates the target translation characterby-character in the target language. The decoder uses an attention mechanism to align its internal state to vectors in the source encoding. It creates an explicit plan of source-target alignments to use at future time-steps based on its current observation and a summary of its past actions. At each time-step it may follow or modify this plan. This enables the model to plan ahead rather than attending to what is relevant primarily at the current generation step. More concretely, we augment the decoder\u2019s internal state with (i) an alignment plan matrix and (ii) a commitment plan vector. The alignment plan matrix is a template of alignments that the model intends to follow at future time-steps, i.e., a sequence of probability distributions over input tokens. The commitment plan vector governs whether to follow the alignment plan at the current step or to recompute it, and thus models discrete decisions. This planning mechanism is inspired by the strategic attentive reader and writer (STRAW) of Vezhnevets et al. (2016).\nOur work is motivated by the intuition that, although natural language is output step-by-step because of constraints on the output process, it is not necessarily conceived and ordered according to only local, step-by-step interactions. Sentences are not conceived one word at a time. Planning, that is, choosing some goal along with candidate macro-actions to arrive at it, is one way to induce coherence in sequential outputs like language. Learning to generate long coherent sequences, or how to form alignments over long input contexts, is difficult for existing models. NMT performance of encoder-decoder models with attention deteriorates as sequence length increases (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), and this effect can be more pronounced at the character-level NMT. This is because character sequences are longer than word sequences. ar X iv :1\n70 6.\n05 08\n7v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Ju\nn 20\n17\nA planning mechanism can make the decoder\u2019s search for alignments more tractable and more scalable.\nWe evaluate our proposed model and report results on character-level translation tasks from WMT\u201915 for English to German, English to Finnish, and English to Czech language pairs. On almost all pairs we observe improvements over a baseline that represents the state of the art in neural character-level translation. In our NMT experiments, our model outperforms the baseline despite using significantly fewer parameters and converges faster in training."}, {"heading": "2 Planning for Character-level Neural Machine Translation", "text": "We now describe how to integrate a planning mechanism into a sequence-to-sequence architecture with attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015).

We denote by st the hidden state of the decoder RNN generating the target output token at time-step t."}, {"heading": "2.2 Alignment and Decoder", "text": "Our goal is a mechanism that plans which parts of the input sequence to focus on for the next k time-steps of decoding. For this purpose, our model computes an alignment plan matrix At\u2208Rk\u00d7|X| and commitment plan vector ct \u2208 Rk at each time-step. Matrix At stores the alignments for the current and the next k\u22121 timesteps; it is conditioned on the current input, i.e. the token predicted at the previous time-step yt, and the current context \u03c8t, which is computed from the input annotations hi. The recurrent decoder function, fdec-rnn(\u00b7), receives st\u22121, yt, \u03c8t as inputs and computes the hidden state vector\nst=fdec-rnn(st\u22121,yt,\u03c8t). (1)\nContext \u03c8t is obtained by a weighted sum of the encoder annotations,\n\u03c8t= |X|\u2211 i \u03b1tihi. (2)\nThe alignment vector \u03b1t = softmax(At[0])\u2208R|X| is a function of the first row of the alignment matrix. At each time-step, we compute a candidate alignmentplan matrix A\u0304t whose entry at the ith row is\nA\u0304t[i]=falign(st\u22121, hj, \u03b2 i t, yt), (3)\nwhere falign(\u00b7) is an MLP and \u03b2it denotes a summary of the alignment matrix\u2019s ith row at time t\u22121. The summary is computed using an MLP, fr(\u00b7), operating row-wise on At\u22121: \u03b2it=fr(At\u22121[i]).\nThe commitment plan vector ct governs whether to follow the existing alignment plan, by shifting it forward from t\u22121, or to recompute it. Thus, ct represents a discrete decision. For the model to operate discretely, we use the recently proposed Gumbel-Softmax trick (Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016) in conjunction with the straight-through estimator (Bengio et al., 2013) to backpropagate through ct.1 The model further learns the temperature for the Gumbel-Softmax as proposed in Gulcehre et al. (2017). Both the commitment vector and the action plan matrix are initialized with ones; this initialization is not modified through training.\nAlignment-plan update Our decoder updates its alignment plan as governed by the commitment plan. Denoted by gt the first element of the discretized commitment plan c\u0304t. In more detail, gt = c\u0304t[0], where the discretized commitment plan is obtained by setting ct\u2019s largest element to 1 and all other elements to 0. Thus, gt is a binary indicator variable; we refer to it as the commitment switch. When gt = 0, the decoder simply advances the time index by shifting the action plan matrix At\u22121 forward via the shift function \u03c1(\u00b7). When gt = 1, the controller reads the action-plan matrix to produce the summary of the plan, \u03b2it. We then compute the updated alignment plan by interpolating the previous alignment plan matrix At\u22121 with the candidate alignment plan matrix A\u0304t. The mixing ratio is determined by a learned update gate ut\u2208Rk\u00d7|X|, whose elements uti correspond to tokens in the input sequence and are\n1We also experimented with training ct using REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) but found that Gumbel-Softmax led to better performance.\ncomputed by an MLP with sigmoid activation, fup(\u00b7):\nuti=fup(hi, st\u22121),\nAt[:,i]=(1\u2212uti) At\u22121[:,i]+uti A\u0304t[:,i].\nTo reiterate, the model only updates its alignment plan when the current commitment switch gt is active.

Specifically, we propose a model variant that reuses the alignment from the previous time-step until the commitment switch activates, at which time the model computes a new alignment. We call this variant repeat, plan, attend, and generate (rPAG). rPAG can be viewed as learning an explicit segmentation with an implicit planning mechanism in an unsupervised fashion. Repetition can reduce the computational complexity of the alignment mechanism drastically; it also eliminates the need for an explicit alignment-plan matrix, which reduces the model\u2019s memory consumption as well.

(2016). We also use the same preprocessing as in that work.2\nWe test our planning models against a baseline on the WMT\u201915 tasks for English to German (En\u2192De), English to Czech (En\u2192Cs), and English to Finnish (En\u2192Fi) language pairs. We present the experimental results in Table 1.\n2Our implementation is based on the code available at https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-cdec\nAs a baseline we use the biscale GRU model of Chung et al. (2016), with the attention mechanisms in both the baseline and (r)PAG conditioned on both layers of the encoder\u2019s biscale GRU (h1 and h2 \u2013 see (Chung et al., 2016) for more detail). Our implementation reproduces the results in the original paper to within a small margin.\nTable 1 shows that our planning mechanism generally improves translation performance over the baseline. It does this with fewer updates and fewer parameters. We trained (r)PAG for 350K updates on the training set, while the baseline was trained for 680K updates. We used 600 units in (r)PAG\u2019s encoder and decoder, while the baseline used 512 in the encoder and 1024 units in the decoder. In total our model has about 4M fewer parameters than the baseline. We tested all models with a beam size of 15.\nAs can be seen from Table 1, layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) improves the performance of the PAG model significantly. However, according to our results on En\u2192De, layer norm affects the performance of rPAG only marginally. Thus, we decided not to train rPAG with layer norm on other language pairs.\nIn Figure 3, we show qualitatively that our model constructs smoother alignments. In contrast to (r)PAG, we see that the baseline decoder aligns the first few characters of each word that it generates to a byte in the source sequence; for the remaining characters it places the largest alignment weight on the final, empty token of the source sequence. This is because the baseline becomes confident of which word to generate after the first few characters, and generates the remainder of the word mainly by relying on language-model predictions. As illustrated by the learning curves in Figure 2, we observe further that (r)PAG converges faster with the help of its improved alignments."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this work, we addressed a fundamental issue in neural generation of long sequences by integrating planning into the alignment mechanism of sequenceto-sequence architectures on machine translation problem. We proposed two different planning mechanisms: PAG, which constructs explicit plans in the form of stored matrices, and rPAG, which plans implicitly and is computationally cheaper. The (r)PAG approach empirically improves alignments over long input sequences. In machine translation experiments, models with a planning mechanism outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline on almost all language pairs using fewer parameters. As a future work, we plan\nto test our planning mechanism at the outputs of the model and other sequence-to-sequence tasks as well."}, {"heading": "A Qualitative Translations from both Models", "text": "In Table 2, we present example translations from our model and the baseline along with the ground-truth. 3\n1 Eine republikanische Strategie , um der Wiederwahl von Obama entgegenzutreten Eine republikanische Strategie gegen die Wiederwahl von Obama Eine republikanische Strategie zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Wahlen von Obama 2 Die F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte der Republikaner rechtfertigen ihre Politik mit der Notwendigkeit , den Wahlbetrug zu bek\u00e4mpfen .
