Introduction", "text": "This paper is about the following task: given partial observation of an undirected unweighted graph, partition the nodes into disjoint clusters so that there are dense connections within clusters, and sparse connections across clusters. By partial observation, we mean that for some node pairs we know if there is an edge or not, and for the other node pairs we do not know\u2014these pairs are unobserved. This problem arises in several fields across science and engineering. For example, in sponsored search, each cluster is a submarket that represents a specific group of advertisers that do most of their spending on a group of query phrases\u2014see e.g., Yahoo!-Inc (2009) for such a project at Yahoo. In VLSI and design automation, it is useful in minimizing signaling between components (Kernighan and Lin, 1970). In social networks, clusters may represent groups of people with\nc\u00a92014 Yudong Chen, Ali Jalali, Sujay Sanghavi and Huan Xu.\nar X\niv :1\n10 4.\n48 03\nv4 [\ncs .L\nG ]\nsimilar interest or background; finding clusters enables better recommendations and link prediction (Mishra et al., 2007). In the analysis of document databases, clustering the citation graph is often an essential and informative first step (Ester et al., 1995). In this paper, we will focus not on specific application domains, but rather on the basic graph clustering problem itself.\nPartially observed graphs appear in many applications. For example, in online social networks like Facebook, we observe an edge/no edge between two users when they accept each other as a friend or explicitly decline a friendship suggestion. For the other user pairs, however, we simply have no friendship information between them, which are thus unobserved. More generally, we have partial observations whenever obtaining similarity data is difficult or expensive (e.g., because it requires human participation). In these applications, it is often the case that most pairs are unobserved, which is the regime we are particularly interested in.\nAs with any clustering problem, we need a precise mathematical definition of the clustering criterion with potentially a guaranteed performance. There is relatively few existing results with provable performance guarantees for graph clustering with partially observed node pairs. Many existing approaches to clustering fully observed graphs either require an additional input (e.g., the number of clusters k required for spectral or k-means clustering methods), or do not guarantee the performance of the clustering. We review existing related work in Section 1.2."}, {"heading": "1.1 Our Approach", "text": "We focus on a natural formulation, one that does not require any other extraneous input besides the graph itself. It is based on minimizing disagreements, which we now define. Consider any candidate clustering; this will have (a) observed node pairs that are in different clusters, but have an edge between them, and (b) observed node pairs that are in the same cluster, but do not have an edge between them. The total number of node pairs of types (a) and (b) is the number of disagreements between the clustering and the given graph. We focus on the problem of finding the optimal clustering\u2014one that minimizes the number of disagreements. Note that we do not pre-specify the number of clusters. For the special case of fully observed graphs, this formulation is exactly the same as the problem of correlation clustering, first proposed by Bansal et al. (2002). They show that exact minimization of the above objective is NP-hard in the worst case\u2014we survey and compare with this and other related work in Section 1.2. As we will see, our approach and results are different.\nWe aim to achieve the combinatorial disagreement minimization objective using matrix splitting via convex optimization. In particular, as we show in Section 2 below, one can represent the adjacency matrix of the given graph as the sum of an unknown low-rank matrix (corresponding to \u201cideal\u201d clusters) and a sparse matrix (corresponding to disagreements from this \u201cideal\u201d in the given graph). Our algorithm either returns a clustering, which is guaranteed to be disagreement minimizing, or returns a \u201cfailure\u201d\u2014it never returns a sub-optimal clustering. For our main analytical result, we evaluate our algorithm\u2019s performance on the natural and classical planted partition/stochastic block model with partial observations. Our analysis provides stronger guarantees than are current results on general matrix splitting (Cande\u0300s et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2011; Li, 2013; Chen et al., 2013). The algorithm, model and results are given in Section 2. We prove our theoretical results in Section 3 and provide empirical results in Section 4."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related Work", "text": "Our problem can be interpreted in the general clustering context as one in which the presence of an edge between two points indicates a \u201csimilarity\u201d, and the lack of an edge means \u201cno similarity\u201d. The general field of clustering is of course vast, and a detailed survey of all methods therein is beyond our scope here. We focus instead on the three sets of papers most relevant to the problem here: the work on correlation clustering, on the planted partition/stochastic block model, and on graph clustering with partial observations."}, {"heading": "1.2.1 CORRELATION CLUSTERING", "text": "As mentioned, for a completely observed graph, our problem is mathematically precisely the same as correlation clustering formulated in Bansal et al. (2002); in particular a \u201c+\u201d in correlation clustering corresponds to an edge in the graph, a \u201c-\u201d to the lack of an edge, and disagreements are defined in the same way. Thus, this paper can equivalently be considered as an algorithm, and guarantees, for correlation clustering under partial observations. Since correlation clustering is NP-hard, there has been much work on devising alternative approximation algorithms (Bansal et al., 2002; Emmanuel and Fiat, 2003). Approximations using convex optimization, including LP relaxation (Charikar et al., 2003; Demaine and Immorlica, 2003; Demaine et al., 2006) and SDP relaxation (Swamy, 2004; Mathieu and Schudy, 2010), possibly followed by rounding, have also been developed. We emphasize that we use a different convex relaxation, and we focus on understanding when our convex program yields an optimal clustering without further rounding.\nWe note that Mathieu and Schudy (2010) use a convex formulation with constraints enforcing positive semi-definiteness, triangle inequalities and fixed diagonal entries. For the fully observed case, their relaxation is at least as tight as ours, and since they add more constraints, it is possible that there are instances where their convex program works and ours does not. However, this seems hard to prove/disprove. Indeed, in the full observation setting they consider, their exact recovery guarantee is no better than ours. Moreover, as we argue in the next section, our guarantees are order-wise optimal in some important regimes and thus cannot be improved even with a tighter relaxation. Practically, our method is faster since, to the best of our knowledge, there is no lowcomplexity algorithm to deal with the \u0398(n3) triangle inequality constraints required by Mathieu and Schudy (2010). This means that our method can handle large graphs while their result is practically restricted to small ones (\u223c 100 nodes). In summary, their approach has higher computational complexity, and does not provide significant and characterizable performance gain in terms of exact cluster recovery."}, {"heading": "1.2.2 PLANTED PARTITION MODEL", "text": "The planted partition model, also known as the stochastic block-model (Condon and Karp, 2001; Holland et al., 1983), assumes that the graph is generated with in-cluster edge probability p and inter-cluster edge probability q (where p > q) and fully observed. The goal is to recover the latent cluster structure. A class of this model with \u03c4 , max{1 \u2212 p, q} < 12 is often used as benchmark for average case performance for correlation clustering (see, e.g., Mathieu and Schudy, 2010). Our theoretical results are applicable to this model and thus directly comparable with existing work in this area. A detailed comparison is provided in Table 1. For fully observed graphs, our result matches the previous best bounds in both the minimum cluster size and the difference between in-cluster/inter-cluster densities. We would like to point out that nuclear norm minimization has\nbeen used to solve the closely related planted clique problem (Alon et al., 1998; Ames and Vavasis, 2011)."}, {"heading": "1.2.3 PARTIALLY OBSERVED GRAPHS", "text": "The previous work listed in Table 1, except Oymak and Hassibi (2011), does not handle partial observations directly. One natural way to proceed is to impute the missing observations with noedge, or random edges with symmetric probabilities, and then apply any of the results in Table 1. This approach, however, leads to sub-optimal results. Indeed, this is done explicitly by Oymak and Hassibi (2011). They require the probability of observation p0 to satisfy p0 & \u221a Kmin n , where n is the number of nodes and Kmin is the minimum cluster size; in contrast, our approach only needs p0 & nK2min (both right hand sides have to be less than 1, requiring Kmin & \u221a n, so the right hand side of our condition is order-wise smaller and thus less restrictive.) Shamir and Tishby (2011) deal with partial observations directly and shows that p0 & 1n suffices for recovering two clusters of size \u2126(n). Our result is applicable to much smaller clusters of size \u2126\u0303( \u221a n). In addition, a nice feature of\nour result is that it explicitly characterizes the tradeoffs between the three relevant parameters: p0, \u03c4 , and Kmin; theoretical result like this is not available in previous work.\nThere exists other work that considers partial observations, but under rather different settings. For example, Balcan and Gupta (2010), Voevodski et al. (2010) and Krishnamurthy et al. (2012) consider the clustering problem where one samples the rows/columns of the adjacency matrix rather than its entries. Hunter and Strohmer (2010) consider partial observations in the features rather than in the similarity graph. Eriksson et al. (2011) show that \u2126\u0303(n) actively selected pairwise similarities are sufficient for recovering a hierarchical clustering structure. Their results seem to rely on the hierarchical structure. When disagreements are present, the first split of the cluster tree can recovers clusters of size \u2126(n); our results allow smaller clusters. Moreover, they require active control over the observation process, while we assume random observations."}, {"heading": "2. Main Results", "text": "Our setup for the graph clustering problem is as follows. We are given a partially observed graph of n nodes, whose adjacency matrix is A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, which has ai,j = 1 if there is an edge between nodes i and j, ai,j = 0 if there is no edge, and ai,j =\u201c?\u201d if we do not know. (Here we follow the convention that ai,i = 0 for all i.) Let \u2126obs , {(i, j) : ai,j 6=?} be the set of observed node pairs. The goal to find the optimal clustering, i.e., the one that has the minimum number of disagreements (defined in Section 1.1) in \u2126obs.\nIn the rest of this section, we present our algorithm for the above task and analyze its performance under the planted partition model with partial observations. We also study the optimality of the performance of our algorithm by deriving a necessary condition for any algorithm to succeed."}, {"heading": "2.1 Algorithm", "text": "Our algorithm is based on convex optimization, and either (a) outputs a clustering that is guaranteed to be the one that minimizes the number of observed disagreements, or (b) declares \u201cfailure\u201d. In particular, it never produces a suboptimal clustering.1 We now briefly present the main idea and then describe the algorithm.\nConsider first the fully observed case, i.e., every ai,j = 0 or 1. Suppose also that the graph is already ideally clustered\u2014i.e., there is a partition of the nodes such that there is no edge between clusters, and each cluster is a clique. In this case, the matrix A + I is now a low-rank matrix, with the rank equal to the number of clusters. This can be seen by noticing that if we re-order the rows and columns so that clusters appear together, the result would be a block-diagonal matrix, with each block being an all-ones submatrix\u2014and thus rank one. Of course, this re-ordering does not change the rank of the matrix, and hence A + I is exactly low-rank.\nConsider now any given graph, still fully observed. In light of the above, we are looking for a decomposition of its A + I into a low-rank part K\u2217 (of block-diagonal all-ones, one block for each cluster) and a remaining B\u2217 (the disagreements), such that the number of non-zero entries in B\u2217 is as small as possible; i.e., B\u2217 is sparse. Finally, the problem we look at is recovery of the best K\u2217 when we do not observe all entries of A + I. The idea is depicted in Figure 1.\n1. In practice, one might be able to use the \u201cfailed\u201d output with rounding as an approximate solution. In this paper, we focus on the performance of the unrounded algorithm.\nWe propose to perform the matrix splitting using convex optimization (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Cande\u0300s et al., 2011). Our approach consists of dropping any additional structural requirements, and just looking for a decomposition of the given A + I as the sum of a sparse matrix B and a low-rank matrix K. Recall that \u2126obs is the set of observed entries, i.e., the set of elements of A that are known to be 0 or 1; we use the following convex program:\nmin B,K \u03bb \u2016B\u20161 + \u2016K\u2016\u2217\ns.t. P\u2126obs(B + K) = P\u2126obs(A + I). (1)\nHere, for any matrix M, the term P\u2126obs(M) keeps all elements of M in \u2126obs unchanged, and sets all other elements to 0; the constraints thus state that the sparse and low-rank matrix should in sum be consistent with the observed entries of A + I. The term \u2016B\u20161 = \u2211 i,j |bi,j | is the `1 norm of the entries of the matrix B, which is well-known to be a convex surrogate for the number of nonzero entries \u2016B\u20160. The second term \u2016K\u2016\u2217 = \u2211 s \u03c3s(K) is the nuclear norm (also known as the trace norm), defined as the sum of the singular values of K. This has been shown to be the tightest convex surrogate for the rank function for matrices with unit spectral norm (Fazel, 2002). Thus our objective function is a convex surrogate for the (natural) combinatorial objective \u03bb\u2016B\u20160 + rank(K). The optimization problem (1) is, in fact, a semidefinite program (SDP) (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011).\nWe remark on the above formulation. (a) This formulation does not require specifying the number of clusters; this parameter is effectively learned from the data. The tradeoff parameter \u03bb is artificial and can be easily determined: since any desired K\u2217 has trace exactly equal to n, we simply choose the smallest \u03bb such that the trace of the optimal solution is at least n. This can be done by, e.g., bisection, which is described below. (b) It is possible to obtain tighter convex relaxations by adding more constraints, such as the diagonal entry constraints ki,i = 1, \u2200i, the positive semidefinite constraint K 0, or even the triangular inequalities ki,j + kj,k \u2212 ki,k \u2264 1. Indeed, this is done by Mathieu and Schudy (2010). Note that the guarantees for our formulation (to be presented in the next subsection) automatically imply guarantees for any other tighter relaxations. We choose to focus on our (looser) formulation for two reasons. First, and most importantly, even with the extra\nconstraints, Mathieu and Schudy (2010) do not deliver better exact recovery guarantees (cf. Table 1). In fact, we show in Section 2.3 that our results are near optimal in some important regimes, so tighter relaxations do not seem to provide additional benefits in exact recovery. Second, our formulation can be solved efficiently using existing Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier methods (Lin et al., 2009). This is no longer the case with the \u0398(n3) triangle inequality constraints enforced by Mathieu and Schudy (2010), and solving it as a standard SDP is only feasible for small graphs.\nWe are interested in the case when the convex program (1) produces an optimal solution K that is a block-diagonal matrix and corresponds to an ideal clustering.\nDefinition 1 (Validity) The convex program (1) is said to produce a valid output if the low-rank matrix part K of the optimal solution corresponds to a graph of disjoint cliques; i.e., its rows and columns can be re-ordered to yield a block-diagonal matrix with all ones for each block.\nValidity of a given K can be easily checked via elementary re-ordering operations.2 Our first simple but useful insight is that whenever the convex program (1) yields a valid solution, it is the disagreement minimizer.\nTheorem 2 For any \u03bb > 0, if the solution of (1) is valid, then it is the clustering that minimizes the number of observed disagreements.\nOur complete clustering procedure is given as Algorithm 1. It takes the adjacency matrix of the graph A and outputs either the optimal clustering or declares failure. Setting the parameter \u03bb is done via binary search. The initial value of \u03bb is not crucial; we use \u03bb = 1\n32 \u221a p\u03040n based on our theoretical analysis in the next sub-section, where p\u03040 is the empirical fraction of observed pairs. To solve the optimization problem (1), we use the fast algorithm developed by Lin et al. (2009), which is tailored for matrix splitting and takes advantage of the sparsity of the observations. By Theorem 2, whenever the algorithm results in a valid K, we have found the optimal clustering.\nAlgorithm 1 Optimal-Cluster(A) \u03bb\u2190 1\n32 \u221a p\u03040n\nwhile not terminated do Solve (1) to obtain the solution (B,K) if K is valid then\nOutput the clustering in K and EXIT. else if trace(K) > n then \u03bb\u2190 \u03bb/2 else if trace(K) < n then \u03bb\u2190 2\u03bb\nend if end while Declare Failure.\n2. If we re-order a valid K such that identical rows and columns appear together, it will become block-diagonal."}, {"heading": "2.2 Performance Analysis", "text": "For the main analytical contribution of this paper, we provide conditions under which the above algorithm will find the clustering that minimizes the number of disagreements among the observed entries. In particular, we characterize its performance under the standard and classical planted partition/stochastic block model with partial observations, which we now describe.\nDefinition 3 (Planted Partition Model with Partial Observations) Suppose that n nodes are partitioned into r clusters, each of size at least Kmin. Let K\u2217 be the low-rank matrix corresponding to this clustering (as described above). The adjacency matrix A of the graph is generated as follows: for each pair of nodes (i, j) in the same cluster, ai,j =? with probability 1 \u2212 p0, ai,j = 1 with probability p0p, or aij = 0 otherwise, independent of all others; similarly, for (i, j) in different clusters, ai,j =? with probability 1\u2212 p0, ai,j = 1 with probability p0q, or ai,j = 0 otherwise.\nUnder the above model, the graph is observed at locations chosen at random with probability p0. In expectation a fraction of 1 \u2212 p of the in-cluster observations are disagreements; similarly, the fraction of disagreements in the across-cluster observations is q. Let B\u2217 = P\u2126obs(A + I \u2212 K\u2217) be the matrix of observed disagreements for the original clustering; note that the support of B\u2217 is contained in \u2126obs. The following theorem provides a sufficient condition for our algorithm to recover the original clustering (B\u2217,K\u2217) with high probability. Combined with Theorem 2, it also shows that under the same condition, the original clustering is disagreement minimizing with high probability.\nTheorem 4 Let \u03c4 = max{1 \u2212 p, q}. There exist universal positive constants c and C such that, with probability at least 1\u2212 cn\u221210, the original clustering (B\u2217,K\u2217) is the unique optimal solution of (1) with \u03bb = 132\u221anp0 provided that\np0 (1\u2212 2\u03c4)2 \u2265 C n log2 n\nK2min . (2)\nNote that the quantity \u03c4 is (an upper bound of) the probability of having a disagreement, and 1\u2212 2\u03c4 is (a lower bound of) the density gap p\u2212 q. The sufficient condition in the theorem is given in terms of the three parameters that define problem: the minimum cluster sizeKmin, the density gap 1\u22122\u03c4 , and the observation probability p0. We remark on these parameters.\n\u2022 Minimum cluster size Kmin. Since the left hand side of the condition (2) in Theorem 4 is no more than 1, it imposes a lower-bound Kmin = \u2126\u0303( \u221a n) on the cluster sizes. This means that\nour method can handle a growing number O\u0303( \u221a n) of clusters. The lower-bound on Kmin is attained when 1 \u2212 2\u03c4 and p0 are both \u0398(1), i.e., not decreasing as n grows. Note that all relevant works require a lower-bound at least as strong as ours (cf. Table 1). \u2022 Density gap 1\u2212 2\u03c4 . When p0 = \u0398(1), our result allows this gap to be vanishingly small, i.e., \u2126\u0303 ( \u221a\nn Kmin\n) , where a larger Kmin allows for a smaller gap. As we mentioned in Section 1.2,\nthis matches the best available results (cf. Table 1), including those in Mathieu and Schudy (2010) and Oymak and Hassibi (2011), which use tighter convex relaxations that are more computationally demanding. We note that directly applying existing results in the low-rankplus-sparse literature (Cande\u0300s et al., 2011; Li, 2013) leads to weaker results, where the gap be bounded below by a constant.\n\u2022 Observation probability p0. When 1 \u2212 2\u03c4 = \u0398(1), our result only requires a vanishing fraction of observations, i.e., p0 can be as small as \u0398\u0303\n( n\nK2min\n) ; a larger Kmin allows for a\nsmaller p0. As mentioned in Section 1.2, this scaling is better than prior results we know of.\n\u2022 Tradeoffs. A novel aspect of our result is that it shows an explicit tradeoff between the observation probability p0 and the density gap 1 \u2212 2\u03c4 . The left hand side of (2) is linear in p0 and quadratic in 1 \u2212 2\u03c4 . This means if the number of observations is four times larger, then we can handle a 50% smaller density gap. Moreover, p0 can go to zero quadratically faster then 1 \u2212 2\u03c4 . Consequently, treating missing observations as disagreements would lead to quadratically weaker results. This agrees with the intuition that handling missing entries with known locations is easier than correcting disagreements whose locations are unknown.\nWe would like to point out that our algorithm has the capability to handle outliers. Suppose there are some isolated nodes which do not belong to any cluster, and they connect to each other and each node in the clusters with probability at most \u03c4 , with \u03c4 obeying the condition (2) in Theorem 4. Our algorithm will classify all these edges as disagreements, and hence automatically reveal the identity of each outlier. In the output of our algorithm, the low rank part K will have all zeros in the columns and rows corresponding to outliers\u2014all their edges will appear in the disagreement matrix B."}, {"heading": "2.3 Lower Bounds", "text": "We now discuss the tightness of Theorem 4.

It shows that when Kmin = \u0398(n), the requirement for 1\u2212 2\u03c4 and p0 in Theorem 4 is optimal up to logarithmic factors, and cannot be significantly improved by using more complicated methods.\nFor the general case with Kmin = O(n), only part of the picture is known.

However, a rigorous proof of this claim is still lacking, and seems to be a difficult problem.

On the other hand, because both K\u2212I and A are adjacency matrices, the entries of B = I+A\u2212K in \u2126obs must be equal to \u22121, 1 or 0 (i.e., it is a disagreement matrix). Clearly any optimal B must have zeros at the entries in \u2126cobs. Hence \u2016B\u20161 = \u2016P\u2126obs(B)\u20160 when K is valid. We thus conclude that the above optimization problem (3) is equivalent to minimizing \u2016P\u2126obs(B)\u20160 subject to the same constraints. This is exactly the minimization of the number of disagreements on the observed edges. Now notice that (1) is a relaxed version of (3). Therefore, if the optimal solution of (1) is valid and thus feasible to (3), then it is also optimal to (3), the disagreement minimization problem."}, {"heading": "3.2 Proof of Theorem 4", "text": "We now turn to the proof of Theorem 4, which provides guarantees for when the convex program (1) recovers the true clustering (B\u2217,K\u2217)."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 PROOF OUTLINE AND PRELIMINARIES", "text": "We overview the main steps in the proof of Theorem 4; details are provided in Sections 3.2.2\u20133.2.4 to follow. We would like to show that the pair (B\u2217,K\u2217) corresponding to the true clustering is the unique optimal solution to our convex program (1). This involves the following three steps.\nStep 1: We show that it suffices to consider an equivalent model for the observation and disagreements. This model is easier to handle, especially when the observation probability and density gap are vanishingly small, which is the regime of interest in this paper.\nStep 2: We write down the sub-gradient based first-order sufficient conditions that need to be satisfied for (B\u2217,K\u2217) to be the unique optimum of (1). In our case, this involves showing the existence of a matrix W\u2014the dual certificate\u2014that satisfies certain properties. This step is technical\u2014requiring us to deal with the intricacies of sub-gradients since our convex function is not smooth\u2014but otherwise standard. Luckily for us, this has been done previously (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Cande\u0300s et al., 2011; Li, 2013).\nStep 3: Using the assumptions made on the true clustering K\u2217 and its disagreements B\u2217, we construct a candidate dual certificate W that meets the requirements in step 2, and thus certify (B\u2217,K\u2217) as being the unique optimum.\nThe crucial Step 3 is where we go beyond the existing literature on matrix splitting (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Cande\u0300s et al., 2011; Li, 2013). These results assume the observation probability and/or density gap is at least a constant, and hence do not apply to our setting. Here we provide a refined analysis, which leads to better performance guarantees than those that could be obtained via a direct application of existing sparse and low-rank matrix splitting results.\nNext, we introduce some notations used in the rest of the proof of the theorem. The following definitions related to K\u2217 are standard. By symmetry, the SVD of K\u2217 has the form U\u03a3UT , where U \u2208 Rn\u00d7r contains the singular vectors of K\u2217. We define the subspace\nT , { UXT + YUT : X,Y \u2208 Rn\u00d7r } ,\nwhich is spanned of all matrices that share either the same column space or the same row space as K\u2217. For any matrix M \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, its orthogonal projection to the space T is given by PT (M) = UUTM + MUUT \u2212UUTMUUT . The projection onto T \u22a5, the complement orthogonal space of T , is given by PT \u22a5(M) = M\u2212 PT (M).\nThe following definitions are related to B\u2217 and partial observations. Let \u2126\u2217 = {(i, j) : b\u2217i,j 6= 0} be the set of matrix entries corresponding to the disagreements. Recall that \u2126obs is the set of observed entries. For any matrix M and entry set \u21260, we let P\u21260 (M) \u2208 Rn\u00d7n be the matrix obtained from M by setting all entries not in the set \u21260 to zero. We write \u21260 \u223c Ber0(p) if the entry set \u21260 does not contain the diagonal entries, and each pair (i, j) and (j, i) (i 6= j) is contained in \u21260 with probability p, independent all others; \u21260 \u223c Ber1(p) is defined similarly except that \u21260 contains all the diagonal entries. Under our partially observed planted partition model, we have \u2126obs \u223c Ber1(p0) and \u2126\u2217 \u223c Ber0(\u03c4).\nSeveral matrix norms are used. \u2016M\u2016 and \u2016M\u2016F represent the spectral and Frobenius norms of the matrix M, respectively, and \u2016M\u2016\u221e , maxi,j |mi,j | is the matrix infinity norm."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 STEP 1: EQUIVALENT MODEL FOR OBSERVATIONS AND DISAGREEMENTS", "text": "It is easy show that increasing p or decreasing q can only make the probability of success higher, so without loss of generality we assume 1 \u2212 p = q = \u03c4 . Observe that the probability of success is completely determined by the distribution of (\u2126obs,B\u2217) under the planted partition model with partial observations. The first step is to show that it suffices to consider an equivalent model for generating (\u2126obs,B\u2217), which results in the same distribution but is easier to handle. This is in the same spirit as Cande\u0300s et al. (2011, Theorems 2.2 and 2.3) and Li (2013, Section 4.1). In particular, we consider the following procedure:\n1. Let \u0393 \u223c Ber1 (p0(1\u2212 2\u03c4)), and \u2126 \u223c Ber0 (\n2p0\u03c4 1\u2212p0+2p0\u03c4\n) . Let \u2126obs = \u0393 \u222a \u2126.\n2. Let S be a symmetric random matrix whose upper-triangular entries are independent and satisfy P(si,j = 1) = P(si,j = \u22121) = 12 .\n3.

In other words, \u2126\u2032 is the entries of S whose signs are consistent with a disagreement matrix.\n4. Define \u2126\u2217 = \u2126\u2032\\\u0393, and \u0393\u0303 = \u2126obs\\\u2126\u2217.\n5. Let B\u2217 = P\u2126\u2217(S).\nIt is easy to verify that (\u2126obs,B\u2217) has the same distribution as in the original model. In particular, we have P[(i, j) \u2208 \u2126obs] = p0, P[(i, j) \u2208 \u2126\u2217, (i, j) \u2208 \u2126obs] = p0\u03c4 and P[(i, j) \u2208 \u2126\u2217, (i, j) /\u2208 \u2126obs] = 0, and observe that given K\u2217, B\u2217 is completely determined by its support \u2126\u2217.\nThe advantage of the above model is that \u0393 and \u2126 are independent of each other, and S has random signed entries. This facilitates the construction of the dual certificate, especially in the regime of vanishing p0 and ( 1 2 \u2212 \u03c4 ) considered in this paper.

Experimental Results", "text": "We explore via simulation the performance of our algorithm as a function of the values of the model parameters (n,Kmin, p0, \u03c4). We see that the performance matches well with the theory.\nIn the experiment, each test case is constructed by generating a graph with n nodes divided into clusters of equal sizeKmin, and then placing a disagreement on each pair of node with probability \u03c4 independently. Each node pair is then observed with probability p0. We then run Algorithm 1, where the optimization problem (1) is solved using the fast algorithm in Lin et al. (2009).. We check if the algorithm successfully outputs a solution that equals to the underlying true clusters. In the first set of experiments, we fix \u03c4 = 0.2 and Kmin = n/4 and vary p0 and n. For each (p0, n), we repeat the experiment for 5 times and plot the probability of success in the left pane of Figure 2.\nOne observes that our algorithm has better performance with larger p0 and n, and the success probability exhibits a phase transition. Theorem 4 predicts that, with \u03c4 fixed and Kmin = n/4, the transition occurs at p0 \u221d n log\n2 n K2min \u221d log 2 n n ; in particular, if we plot the success probability against\nthe control parameter p0n log2 n , all curves should align with each other. Indeed, this is precisely what we see in the right pane of Figure 2 where we use p0nlogn as the control parameter. This shows that Theorem 4 gives the correct scaling between p0 and n up to an extra log factor.\nIn a similar fashion, we run another three sets of experiments with the following settings: (1) n = 1000 and \u03c4 = 0.2 with varying (p0,Kmin); (2) Kmin = n/4 and p0 = 0.2 with varying (\u03c4, n); (3) n = 1000 and p0 = 0.6 with varying (\u03c4,Kmin). The results are shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5; note that each x-axis corresponds to a control parameter chosen according to the scaling predicted by Theorem 4. Again we observe that all the curves roughly align, indicating a good match with the theory. In particular, by comparing Figures 2 and 4 (or Figures 3 and 5), one verifies the quadratic tradeoff between observations and disagreements (i.e., p0 vs. 1\u2212 2\u03c4 ) as predicted by Theorem 4.\nFinally, we compare the performance of our method with spectral clustering, a popular method for graph clustering. For spectral clustering, we first impute the missing entries of the adjacency\nmatrix with either zeros or random 1/0\u2019s. We then compute the first k principal components of the adjacency matrix, and run k-means clustering on the principal components (von Luxburg, 2007); here we set k equal to the number of clusters. The adjacency matrix is generated in the same fashion as before using the parameters n = 2000,Kmin = 200 and \u03c4 = 0.1. We vary the observation probability p0 and plot the success probability in Figure 6. It can be observed that our method outperforms spectral clustering with both imputation schemes; in particular, it requires fewer observations."}, {"heading": "5.

We note that Mathieu and Schudy (2010) use a convex formulation with constraints enforcing positive semi-definiteness, triangle inequalities and fixed diagonal entries. For the fully observed case, their relaxation is at least as tight as ours, and since they add more constraints, it is possible that there are instances where their convex program works and ours does not. However, this seems hard to prove/disprove. Indeed, in the full observation setting they consider, their exact recovery guarantee is no better than ours. Moreover, as we argue in the next section, our guarantees are order-wise optimal in some important regimes and thus cannot be improved even with a tighter relaxation. Practically, our method is faster since, to the best of our knowledge, there is no lowcomplexity algorithm to deal with the \u0398(n3) triangle inequality constraints required by Mathieu and Schudy (2010).

(2011) show that 1 \u2212 2\u03c4 & \u221a n Kmin is necessary when \u03c4 = \u0398(1) and the graph is fully observed; otherwise recovery is impossible or computationally hard.", "startOffset": 42, "endOffset": 575}, {"referenceID": 9, "context": "Luckily for us, this has been done previously (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Cand\u00e8s et al., 2011; Li, 2013).", "startOffset": 46, "endOffset": 106}, {"referenceID": 7, "context": "Luckily for us, this has been done previously (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Cand\u00e8s et al., 2011; Li, 2013).", "startOffset": 46, "endOffset": 106}, {"referenceID": 30, "context": "Luckily for us, this has been done previously (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Cand\u00e8s et al., 2011; Li, 2013).", "startOffset": 46, "endOffset": 106}, {"referenceID": 9, "context": "The crucial Step 3 is where we go beyond the existing literature on matrix splitting (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Cand\u00e8s et al., 2011; Li, 2013).", "startOffset": 85, "endOffset": 145}, {"referenceID": 7, "context": "The crucial Step 3 is where we go beyond the existing literature on matrix splitting (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Cand\u00e8s et al., 2011; Li, 2013).", "startOffset": 85, "endOffset": 145}, {"referenceID": 30, "context": "The crucial Step 3 is where we go beyond the existing literature on matrix splitting (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Cand\u00e8s et al., 2011; Li, 2013).", "startOffset": 85, "endOffset": 145}, {"referenceID": 30, "context": "4 in Li (2013) and the discussion thereafter.", "startOffset": 5, "endOffset": 15}, {"referenceID": 7, "context": "4 STEP 3: DUAL CERTIFICATE CONSTRUCTION We use a variant of the so-called golfing scheme (Cand\u00e8s et al., 2011; Gross, 2011) to construct W.", "startOffset": 89, "endOffset": 123}, {"referenceID": 23, "context": "4 STEP 3: DUAL CERTIFICATE CONSTRUCTION We use a variant of the so-called golfing scheme (Cand\u00e8s et al., 2011; Gross, 2011) to construct W.", "startOffset": 89, "endOffset": 123}, {"referenceID": 30, "context": "We then run Algorithm 1, where the optimization problem (1) is solved using the fast algorithm in Lin et al.

We want to organize the nodes into disjoint clusters so that there is relatively dense (observed) connectivity within clusters, and sparse across clusters. We take a novel yet natural approach to this problem, by focusing on finding the clustering that minimizes the number of \u201cdisagreements\u201d\u2014i.e., the sum of the number of (observed) missing edges within clusters, and (observed) present edges across clusters. Our algorithm uses convex optimization; its basis is a reduction of disagreement minimization to the problem of recovering an (unknown) low-rank matrix and an (unknown) sparse matrix from their partially observed sum. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on the classical Planted Partition/Stochastic Block Model. Our main theorem provides sufficient conditions for the success of our algorithm as a function of the minimum cluster size, edge density and observation probability; in particular, the results characterize the tradeoff between the observation probability and the edge density gap. When there are a constant number of clusters of equal size, our results are optimal up to logarithmic factors.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
