The main purpose of these researches is to describea restricted set of maximal tractable subalgebras, ideally in an exhaustive fashion withrespect to the hosting algebras.In this paper we introduce a novel algebra for reasoning about Spatial Congruence, showthat the satis ability problem in the spatial algebra MC-4 is NP-complete, and present acomplete classi cation of tractability in the algebra, based on the individuation of threemaximal tractable subclasses, one containing the basic relations. The three algebras areformed by 14, 10 and 9 relations out of 16 which form the full algebra.1. IntroductionQualitative spatial reasoning has received an increasing amount of interest in the recentliterature. The main reason for this, as already observed by Jonsson and Drakengren (1997),is probably that spatial reasoning has proved to be applicable to real-world problems, as inGeographical Information Systems (Egenhofer, 1991; Grigni, Papadias, & Papadimitriou,1995), and Molecular Biology (Cui, 1994).The speci c stress on qualitative reasoning about space, as observed by Zimmermann(1995), is justi ed by the fact that qualitative spatial relations can be treated as e cientlyas their quantitative counterparts, but they seem to be closer to the model of relationshumans adopt for spatial reasoning.Even though qualitative spatial reasoning has an extended literature, in spite of itsrelatively short history, certain aspects of the discipline have been neglected. In particular,no exhaustive computational perspective has been developed on qualitative morphologicalreasoning about space. The term morphological reasoning is intended to suggest reasoningabout the internal structure of the objects. In the case of spatial reasoning this includesreasoning about the size, shape and internal topology of spatial regions.The purpose of the present work is to analyse the complexity of reasoning about relationsof congruence, either actual or partial, between spatial regions, using the spatial algebraMC-4 which has been preliminarly analysed by Cristani (1997).The algebra MC-4 is a Constraint Algebra (Ladkin & Maddux, 1994) for qualitativereasoning about the morphological relation of congruence. Two spatial regions, in themodels documented in literature, are considered to be equivalent if and only if they shareinterior and boundaries, namely if and only if they are the same spatial region. In particular,c 1999 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers. All rights reserved.\nCristanithe relation EQ, as de ned by Randell, Cui and Cohn (1989), and analogously by Egenhoferand Franzosa (1991), becomes identity under the unique name assumption. Geometry andtopology, conversely, allow other kinds of equivalence relations. These relations are weakerthan the identity, namely the equivalence classes they induce are larger than singletons.The simplest weakening we can de ne is the congruence relation. Even though, therelation has been studied (Borgo, Guarino, & Masolo, 1996, 1997; Cristani, 1997; Mutinelli,1998), the complexity of reasoning in subalgebras has not yet been deeply investigated.The reason to introduce this new relation, and to provide an algebraic structure to hostrelations based on it (in particular relations in which we compare regions, which, even ifthey are not congruent, can be overlapped by roto-translating one into the interior of theother), is that, in many cases, the knowledge we have to represent in our systems necessarilyincludes internal structures. Consider the following example.Example 1A GIS is dedicated to the representation of geographical data about industrial sites.In the system, the structure of factories can be described by means of various attributes,including size and shape. One of the users wants to query the system about the opportunityof moving the factory, where he works, from the present site to a new one. In the new siteprefabricated facilities already exist, and the problem consists of deciding how to preservetopological layout of the factory and minimise the costs of buying new engines, to substitutethose which cannot t with the new facilities.In order to reason about these problems the system can be made able to represent thequalitative relations between the old and new site parts, establishing, in particular whetherthe spatial regions occupied by the engines are \\congruent\", or even \\congruent to a part\"of the ones which can be chosen for hosting them in the new factory's site.Clearly we cannot use topological information, since a spatial region presently occupiedby an engine is surely disjoint from the region that this engine is going to occupy in the newsite, but this information is insu cient for deciding whether the new site is able to host theengine itself.Though metric information can be involved in nal decision about moving the factory,qualitative reasoning can be used in the initial design phase.In Figure 1 we give a pictorial representation of one possible situation in which, to makedecisions, we need to represent spatial information which is not topological. The algebra MC-4 can be used to represent the four basic relations which can be built onthe equivalence relation of congruence: if we consider the roto-translation of a region x withrespect to a region y, only four possible situations arise. There is at least one roto-translation in which x coincides with y. The two regionsare congruent. There is at least one roto-translation in which x coincides with a proper part of y.The region x is congruent to a proper part of y.362\nThe Complexity of Reasoning about Spatial Congruence\nFigure 1: A pictorial representation of the relations to be analysed in a GIS for movinga factory from an old to a new site. Note that the production lines of the newfacility may not be suitable for hosting certain engines. There is at least one roto-translation in which y coincides with a proper part of x.The region x has a proper part congruent to y. None of the above. The region x and y cannot be perfectly overlapped.We would like to stress here three main aspects of these relations.1. The relations can be established between two spatial regions in any position of space.There is no speci c need for the regions to be close, or to be in any particular topolog-ical relation, provided that the relation is compatible; so these congruence relationsare purely morphological.2. The equality of two regions implies congruence. The relation of proper part excludesmorphological relations other than \\congruent to a part\". This is not the case for themorphological side. A region can be congruent to a part of another region, even ifthey are disjoint, and the same can happen to congruence, as already stated in point1.3. Even if two regions are of the same size, there may be the case that the regions arenot congruent. This holds also for partial congruence, being possible that a region issmaller than another one but they cannot be overlapped.The practical relevance of the algebra can be proved by exhibiting many other examples,especially coming from GIS. In this paper we deal with the problem of reasoning aboutcongruence in two-dimensional space domain. The kind of congruence we assume is theweakest one: roto-translability. Three-dimensional congruence is not of the same type. The\\natural\" notion of three-dimensional congruence is isometry, which is much more generalthan roto-translability. For example left and right hands are congruent (under the simpli edassumption that they have the same shape and size), but they cannot be roto-translatedeach into the other one. We concentrate here in two-dimensional reasoning which may be363\nCristanianalysed in terms of roto-translation and topological relations. The analysis of isometriesis left for further work.The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes related work which has beendeveloped in the area. Section 3 presents the spatial algebra MC-4, and Section 4 discussesthe classi cation of tractability we found for this algebra. Finally, in Section 5, someconclusions are given.2. Previous WorkFrom the perspective of individuating primitives to describe space, a signi cant e ort hasbeen lately spent, in the direction of de ning binary relations between spatial regions, whichmay be used as a model of space in qualitative terms. Moreover, it was natural, in the AIcommunity, to use Constraint Processing for reasoning about such binary relations. Aspeci c attention to Constraint Processing emerged in the Spatial Database community,and in the community of Geographical Information Science as well.Two apparently independently developed models, which can be shown to be essentiallyequivalent, exist in the Arti cial Intelligence (Randell & Cohn, 1989; Randell, Cui, &Cohn, 1992) and Spatial Database literatures (Egenhofer & Herring, 1990; Egenhofer &Franzosa, 1991; Franzosa & Egenhofer, 1992). The Arti cial Intelligence model, (Randell &Cohn, 1989; Randell et al., 1992) is known as RCC, where the acronym stands for RegionConnection Calculus.The RCC model is centered on the primitive of \\connection\" as originally suggestedby Clarke (1981). Gotts (1994) and further Gotts, Gooday and Cohn (1996) obtainedconnection to be the only primitive. In the original framework (Randell & Cohn, 1989;Randell et al., 1992) the model was formulated in two versions, now called RCC-5 andRCC-8. The RCC-5 model is a model in which we cannot distinguish between interiorand boundary of a spatial region (so that the external connection may be tangency oroverlapping, for example), while in the RCC-8 model this distinction is possible.Bennett (1994, 1995), used propositional logic to represent RCC reasoning problems. Heobserved that, given a propositional logic, and interpreting the truth values of each formulaas a spatial region, the language of RCC-5 is su cient to express a satisfaction problem atthe semantical level. This fact, however, is not due to the spatial interpretation, becausea non-spatial interpretation in which the RCC-5 relations are still su cient to representtruth condition at semantical level can be found: set theory. Therefore, he applied theresult of Cook (1971) on NP-completeness of classical propositional logic to the restrictedmodel RCC-5, proving that deciding the consistency of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem(CSP) on RCC-5 is an NP-complete problem too.The complete model of RCC-8, instead, can not be analysed in terms of pure set theory,because the distinction between boundary-connection and interior-connection is possible.This distinction means that the minimal interpretation in which RCC-8 still provides acorrect and complete representation of truth conditions at semantical level requires topology.Statman (1979) proved that intuitionistic logic along with interpretations in set theory forcesa topology in the models of a sound theory. Bennett proved, thus, that RCC-8 can be usedto de ne the truth conditions of formulas in an intuitionistic propositional logic. Statman(1979) proved that intuitionistic propositional logic is PSPACE-complete. However, since364\nThe Complexity of Reasoning about Spatial Congruencewe do not need a complete truth veri cation procedure, but only a procedure for constraintprocessing, Bennett could reduce the result, proving that also RCC-8 is NP-complete.These results, even if they are in general negative for practical purposes, encouragedresearches in the direction of restricted models, in such a way that at least for certaincases we may process a nite set of RCC constraints in polynomial fashion on deterministicmachines. In particular, Nebel (1995) showed that reasoning with the basic relations ofRCC-5 and RCC-8 are tractable problems. Renz and Nebel (1999) improved the resultsabove, by showing that there exists a maximal tractable subclass of RCC-5, denoted bybH5, formed by 28 relations out of 32, which includes all the basic relations, and a maximaltractable subclass of RCC-8, denoted by bH8, formed by 148 relations out of 256 includingthe basic relations. A maximal tractable subclass A, is a subset of a constraint algebra, suchthat problems de ned on A are tractable, while problems de ned on proper supersets of Aare not. These results have been obtained in a similar fashion to the work of Nebel andB urckert (1995) on temporal reasoning. The result of Renz and Nebel is anyway incomplete,since he simply proved that there exists one maximal tractable subclass, and he did notclassify every maximal tractable subclasses of RCC-5. Jonsson and Drakengren (1997)showed that there exist four maximal tractable subclasses of RCC-5, one including thebasic relations. The result is obtained in a similar fashion to (Drakengren & Jonsson, 1997;Jonsson, Drakengren, & B ackstr om, 1999). A complete analysis of the RCC-8 maximaltractable subclasses including the basic relations has been provided by Renz in (1999).Our result is the analogous in MC-4 of Jonsson and Drakengren result for RCC-5. TheMC-4 algebra, we describe in this paper, is structured in the same way as the Algebra ofPartially Ordered Time (PO-time algebra), studied by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez. Wewould like to stress two main aspects here: The MC-4 algebra has the PO-time algebra are the same algebraic structure: thediscussion of this paper stands a di erent interpretation of the PO-time algebra, evendi erent from the spatial interpretation provided by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez intheir papers. The computational results we present here can be applied to the PO-time algebra aswell, and they extend the previous ndings obtained by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez.In particular Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez (1998, 1999), proved that path-consistencyis insu cient to ensure consistency for relations in this algebra, and that there exists atractable subalgebra of it which can be treated by an O(n3) algorithm.Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez (1999), showed that deciding the consistency of a PO-timenetwork is an NP-complete problem by reducing to it the analogous decision problem onRCC-5.Some important observations are needed, with respect to the results of Anger, Mitraand Rodriguez: The results on the complexity of PO-time algebra can be applied to MC-4, only ifwe can show that when a MC-4 network is consistent then we can exhibit a consis-tent scenario in which vertices of the network are substituted with spatial regions.Therefore, even if we can show this correspondence for PO-time algebra too, ourNP-completeness result is independent. Moreover, the method we used to prove the365\nCristaniintractability of MC-4 is independent as well, and the main di erence is in the waywe used to exhibit problematic algebraic structure. Through this proof we derived asimple way to solve the problems whenever possible in polynomial time. The discovery of the tractable subalgebras we indicate by M99, M81 and M72 inthe present paper, deserves acknowledgement of priority to Anger, Mitra and Ro-driguez. However, Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez also classi ed one more algebra, whichis tractable, but not maximal, since it is contained in M99. Moreover, the algorithmswe found for M99 and M81 are substantially di erent from the one Anger, Mitra andRodriguez present and more e cient, being O(n2) instead of O(n3). Therefore thetwo algorithmic solutions can be considered as independent results as well. The classi cation presented here is complete, since we classify all the maximal tractablesubalgebras of MC-4, and this is a result which may be applied to temporal reasoningas well, since it is obtained by means of algorithms which are completely independentfrom the interpretation we give to the relations (either spatial or temporal). The introduction of morphological relations in spatial reasoning is novel too, and thestudy of spatial congruence deserves, in our opinion, deep investigations henceforth.The fact that two algebras of spatial and temporal reasoning present substantial sim-ilarities is not a novelty. The RCC model corresponds to subalgebras of IntervalCalculus, as stated by Bennett (1994). Also Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez stated thisproperty of PO-time algebra with respect to RCC-5, but their interpretation is com-pletely di erent from our own, the equality of PO-time being interpreted as EQ inRCC-5, while we interpret it as congruence.Thus, even though a similar algebraic structure has been partially investigated before, thepresent paper presents substantial methodological di erences and we have obtained resultswhich are independent of or extensions to the ones obtained by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez.In the remainder of the paper, when a result can be attributed to Anger, Mitra andRodriguez we note it in the text.3. The Spatial Algebra MC-4In this section we present the spatial algebra MC-4, which has been previously presentedby Cristani (1997) and largely analysed in by Mutinelli (1998).MC-4 is a Binary Constraint Algebra (henceforth indicated as a Constraint Algebra). Ina Constraint Algebra we have a Constraint Domain and an Algebra Base, which is formedby mutually exclusive relations among elements of the Constraint Domain, whose unionform the universal relation. The converse of a basic relation is a basic relation too, andthe composition of basic relations is the union of some basic relations. A Constraint is theestablishment of one of all possible unions of basic relations between two variables whichvary on the domain. A constraint is satis ed by an assignment of one pair of values of thedomain to the variables, so that the pair of values is in one of the relations of the constraintitself. Given a nite set of constraints between two variables, the problem of decidingwhether there exists an assignment to the variables such that all the constraints can be366\nThe Complexity of Reasoning about Spatial Congruence x CG y x\nx x\nx CGPP y x CNO y\ny\ny\ny\nFigure 2: A pictorial representation of the basic relations of MC-4 CG CGPP CGPP 1 CNOCG CG CGPP CGPP 1 CNOCGPP CGPP CGPP > CGPPCNOCGPP 1 CGPP 1 > CGPP 1 CGPP 1CNOCNO CNO CGPPCNO CGPP 1CNO >Table 1: The composition table of MC-4.

Our interpretation is themost restrictive one: two regions are congruent i they can be rigidly roto-translated intoeach other.A region x, in this interpretation, may be congruent (x CG y) to a region y, or congruentto a part of y (x CGPP y) or they cannot be perfectly overlapped (x CNO y). The relationcongruent to a part of may also be inverted to having a part congruent to (y CGPP 1 x i x CGPP y).In Figure 2 a pictorial representation of the three basic relations CG, CGPP and CNO isgiven. In Table 1 we present the composition table of MC-4 showing how the basic relationscompose with each other. 367\nCristani x PP y -1x DR y x PO y x PP y x EQ y\nx y x y x y x y x yFigure 3: A pictorial representation of the relations of RCC-5.A CSP can be represented by a Network of Constraints. A network of constraints is alabelled graph G = hV; ; Ei, where V is a nite set of vertices, E is a binary relation onV whose elements are called edges, and is a labelling function which maps each vertexof G to a variable, and each edge to a relation of a Constraint Algebra on a given domainD. Given a network of constraints G, the problem of deciding the consistency of G is theproblem of establishing whether is it possible to instantiate each vertex label (the variables)with elements of D, in such a way that all the relations represented in G as labels of theedges are simultaneously satis ed. The CSP represented by a network G is often referred to,for the algebra A, as A-SAT(G). For the sake of simplicity we refer to the CSP representedby a network G on MC-4 as MSAT(G).The main result on the MC-4 algebra, with respect to MSAT, is unfortunately a negativecomputational account. In general, deciding the consistency is hard to solve for networksof constraints between variables representing spatial regions, as stated in Theorem 2. Thisresult has been already proved by Cristani (1997).Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez (1998), showed that path-consistency cannot be appliedsuccessfully to the Algebra of Partially Ordered Time, which is isomorphic to MC-4 at thesyntactic level. This is insu cient to prove that the CSP on this algebra is NP-complete.They showed (Anger et al., 1999) that PO-time algebra is NP-complete. Their proof lies onthe translation, which can be shown to be analogous, but not identical, to the translationwe introduced here, at the syntactical level, being completely di erent at the semanticalone. However, their proof is insu cient to show that we can arrange spatial solutions,since the map they de ned is purely syntactical. As already observed by Lemon (1996),the representation of space by means of relation algebra is not pure, and we can obtainsatis able networks which are not realizable in space. Our proof, instead, can be appliedto spatial interpretations. It can be applied to nonlinear time temporal interpretations aswell, since the syntactic level is shown to be su cient for space, and nonlinear time can beinterpreted as space too (Anger et al., 1999).Before getting into the proof of this negative result we need to describe a relevantcorrespondences of the MC-4 algebra to the RCC-5 model, which is also used in the proofof Theorem 2. The well known RCC-5 algebra is a Constraint Algebra with 5 basic relations:EQ , DR , PO , PP , PP 1 . The ve relations correspond to the pictorial representation ofFigure 3.If two spatial regions are in one of the relations of MC-4, then only certain relationsof RCC-5 can be established between them. Conversely, if certain relations of RCC-5 areestablished only certain corresponding relations of MC-4 are. This correspondence, however,is not one-to-one. Consider, for instance, a region x and a region y, such that x DR y, in368\nThe Complexity of Reasoning about Spatial Congruence Rel. of MC-4 Rel. of RCC-5CG fEQ;DR;POgCGPP fPP;DR;POgCGPP 1 fPP 1;DR;POgCNO fDR;POgTable 2: The basic relations of MC-4 and their counterparts in RCC-5.

Then, each relation of MC-4 can be established betweenx and y. However, if x PP y, namely x is a proper part of y, then only the CGPP relationcan be established between x and y. On the other hand, if two regions are congruent, onlythe relations DR , PO and EQ can exist between x and y.In Table 3 we set the correspondences between MC-4 basic relations and RCC-5, whilein Table 2 we set the correspondences between RCC-5 and MC-4.The correspondences of the above Tables are not su ciently strict, to use them in prov-ing that MSAT(MC-4) is an NP-complete problem by a direct polynomial reduction. Ifwe consider a CSP on MC-4, the corresponding RCC-5 CSP is not intractable, since therelations obtained from Table 2 do not de ne an intractable subset of RCC-5, by meansof the complete classi cation established by Jonsson and Drakengren (1997). Therefore,MSAT(MC-4) is not reducible to RSAT(RCC-5) (the RSAT symbol represents the satis -ability in RCC models) by the corresponding relation mapping of Table 2.Conversely, we can establish, by means of the above Tables, that among all the possibleregions satisfying the relation CG, there exists at least one pair in which the regions areEQ, that when CGPP is established, there exists one pair in a PP relation, and nally thatwhen CNO is established, we have two regions in a PO relation. The summary of thiscorrespondence is reported in Table 4.This correspondence is obtained from the de nition of basic relations. Two regions aand b are congruent i we can roto-translate a by a T in such a way that T (a) EQ b orconversely by T 0 so that T 0(b) EQ a. Analogously a is congruent to a part of b i we can369\nCristani Rel. of MC-4 Rel. of RCC-5CG EQCGPP PPCGPP 1 PP 1CNO POTable 4: The basic relations of MC-4 and their counterparts in RCC-5 in the special map-ping .roto-translate a by T so that T (a) PP b. Finally two regions are in a CNO relation i theycan only be in a PO relation or disjoint.The correspondence of Table 4 is called , and a Network of Constraints G on MC-4translated in RCC-5 by it is denoted by (G). The networks which are labelled on all edgesby basic relations of MC-4 are henceforth called scenarios of MC-4.Consider a consistent scenario S of MC-4. Applying the composition tables of MC-4 andRCC-5, we clearly derive that the scenario of RCC-5 (S) is consistent, when the scenarioof MC-4 does so. The consequence of above reasoning is the next lemma.Lemma 1 If a scenario on MC-4 is consistent, then (G) is consistent.Ladkin and Maddux (1994) proved that a network of constraints is consistent i it has aconsistent scenario. Therefore, an immediate consequence of Lemma 1 is that if a networkof constraints G on MC-4 is consistent, then (G) is consistent. We are now able to provea rst theorem.Theorem 1 MSAT(MC-4) is NP-hard.ProofBy the observation about existence of consistent scenarios in a Constraint Algebra dueto Mackworth and Freuder (1985), we obtain a polynomial reduction of RSAT(RCC-5) toMSAT(MC-4).It su ces to note that if we can solve MSAT then we can solve RCC-5 problems obtainedby the translation as well. Now, the problems mapped from MC-4 into RCC-5 by meansof can be trivially inverted by 1, since is trivially one-to-one. This means that eachproblem in the set of relations obtained in RCC-5 by corresponds to a problem in MC-4,and vice versa.The set of relations of RCC-5 translated by contains fPP;PP 1g and PO . Nebel andRenz (1999), proved that each set of relations of RCC-5 containing these two relations isintractable. Therefore the set (MC 4) is intractable.This proves that if we are able to solve a problem in MC-4 we can solve a problem of asubset of RCC-5 which is intractable. Therefore MSAT(MC-4) is NP-hard. 370\nThe Complexity of Reasoning about Spatial CongruenceMackworth and Freuder (1985) also proved that backtracking can be applied to CSPs. Thebacktracking algorithm is usually implemented by a linear non-deterministic technique,being therefore a polynomial algorithm on non-deterministic machines.The backtracking technique is applicable to MC-4 as well, so we can perform a poly-nomial solution of MSAT on nondeterministic machines. This shows that MSAT is in NP,and allows us to claim:Theorem 2 MSAT(MC-4) is NP-complete.Because of this negative result a deep investigation is needed to de ne tractable sub-classes of the set of 16 relations which allow us to perform polynomial analysis for at leasta subset of the networks of constraints de nable on MC-4.In this paper we give the de nition of the three maximal tractable subclasses of MC-4, exhibiting therefore a complete classi cation of tractability for the algebra. The threemaximal tractable subclasses have already been studied by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez in(1999). They obtain maximality of the algebras, and exhibited O(n3) algorithms. We havethree main di erences here with respect to their paper:1. The number of classes we individuated is lower than theirs, because they found fourmaximal tractable subclasses. They failed to note that one of the four subalgebras isa subset of another one. In Table 10 the subalgebra M88 corresponds to the fourthalgebra of Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez. This subalgebra is tractable, but not maximal.2. The algorithms we exhibit are all O(n2) while Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez exhibitedonly an O(n3) algorithm for one of the three maximal subsets.3. Our classi cation is complete. Thus any subset of MC-4 which is not a subset of one ofthe three maximal tractable subalgebras we individuated is intractable. Anger, Mitraand Rodriguez did not nd this result, since they did not analyse all the subalgebrasof PO-time algebra, as we did for MC-4.4. Maximal Tractable Subclasses of MC-4Given a subset S of a constraint algebra A, we indicate by bS the set formed by all therelations of A which can be written as expressions of the algebra involving only elementsof S and the operations of composition, intersection and converse of relations. This set isoften called the transitive closure of S with respect to the operations above. We refer to itas the closure of S. A set S which coincides with its closure is called a subalgebra.In the previous section we recall the result on NP-completeness for MC-4. The rstimportant observation on the complexity of subalgebras is that, when a subalgebra B doesnot contain the empty relation, then a network of constraints on B cannot entail a strictcontradiction: then it is consistent. So far, the problem is necessarily polynomially solvable,because it is O(1). This is stated in the next lemma.Lemma 2 Given an algebra A, if a subalgebra B of A does not contain the empty relation,then SAT(B) is polynomial. 371\nCristaniThe main consequence of Lemma 2 is that we can limit ourselves in the analysis ofsubalgebras in MC-4 to these subalgebras which contain the empty relation.Moreover, since a network of constraints represents the relations in an implicit way,when an edge of a network is not labelled we should interpret it as representing the universalrelation. Therefore, the universal relation should be a member of the subalgebras to whichwe are interested in. We call algebras which contain both the empty and the universalrelations expressive algebras.There are 102 expressive subalgebras, we denominate Mi where i varies between 0 to101. In Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 9 of Appendix A, the 102 expressive subalgebras of MC-4 arelisted.Lemma 3 Given a subset A of MC-4, A is an expressive subalgebra i A is one of thesubalgebras Mi with i between 0 and 101 .ProofConsider a subset A of MC-4. We test the closure of A by a LISP program which computesthe closure by composition, intersection and converse of a subset of MC-4, and test thepresence of empty and universal relation in A by the obvious membership test. The LISPprocedure TRANSITIVE-CLOSURE is listed in Online Appendix 1, which accompanies thisarticle. The test succeeds for the subalgebras Mi with i between 0 and 101 and fails for allthe other 216 102 = 65434 subsets of MC-4. The claim is therefore proved. The following technical lemma shows that some of the 102 subalgebras individuatedabove are NP-hard. There are 20 subalgebras of the 102 which are intractable by Lemma4. The algebras are presented in Table 5 of Appendix A. The proof of Lemma 5 is a trivialconsequence of the proof of Theorem 2.Lemma 4 Given a subalgebra A of MC-4, if A contains the relations CNO and fCGPP;CGPP 1g then MSAT(A) is NP-hard.In the next three subsections we show that three maximal tractable subclasses of MC-4 canbe found, so that the only intractable algebras are the 20 listed in Table 5 of Appendix A.4.1 The CG -complete Subalgebra M72When proving that the class R528 is tractable, Jonsson and Drakengren (1997) observedthat any subalgebra of RCC-5 containing only relations including EQ is tractable. Thisresult applies also to MC-4 with respect to the relation CG, and also to the relations CNO,fCGPP; CGPP 1g, fCG; CNOg, fCG;CGPP; CGPP 1g.The only relevant cases are CG , CNO and fCGPP; CGPP 1g , since the other twocases are included in two of the former three. An algebra formed by relations which allcontain CG and by the relation ? is tractable, because we can obtain an inconsistencyi we explicitly have an edge labelled by ? in the network. Deciding the consistency istherefore an O(n2) problem. 372\nThe Complexity of Reasoning about Spatial CongruenceALGORITHM M72-CONSISTENCYINPUT: A constraint network T on M72OUTPUT: Yes if T has a solution formed by spa-tial regions of R2 , no if not.1.

The same algo-rithm can be applied to subalgebras formed only with relations containing a symmetricalrelation in MC-4 and the empty relation. Then we can also prove the polynomiality forsubalgebras of relations all containing CNO, or all containing fCGPP;CGPP 1g, if such sub-algebras exist. The subalgebra formed by relations containing CNO and the empty relationis M78, the subalgebra formed only by relations containing fCGPP; CGPP 1g is M31. InTable 7 and in Table 8 of Appendix A the subalgebras of M78 and of M31 are shown.In the next subsection we introduce a maximal tractable subclass which includes M78,and in subsection 4.3 we introduce an algebra containingM31, so that the proof of tractabil-ity for subalgebras in Tables 7 and 8 can be derived from these tables as well. Conversely,the subalgebra M72 is neither a subalgebra of M99 nor a subalgebra of M81, so Theorem 3is an independent result. 373\nCristani4.2 The Maximal Tractable Subclass M99We look for a maximal tractable subalgebra containing all the basic relations. The bestcandidate, based on Table 5, is M99, which is the only algebra formed by more than 13relations which can be polynomial, because we did not show that it is NP-hard by reducingit to an intractable problem over RCC-5.M99 = f?, CG, CGPP, CGPP 1, CNO, fCG; CGPPg, fCG; CGPP 1g, fCG; CNOg,fCGPP; CNOg, fCGPP 1; CNOg, fCG; CGPP; CNOg, fCG; CGPP 1; CNOg, >g.Fortunately, we can prove the tractability of M99, so it is maximal based on the factthat all algebras containing the basic relations are either intractable by Table 5 or subsetsof M99.Consider the subset of M99,G99 = ffCG; CGPPg, fCG; CNOg, fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOgg.The following claim holds.Lemma 5 dG99 =M99.ProofThe following expressions represent valid implementations of relations in M99 using onlyelements of G99 and the operators of composition, intersection and converse.t.1. ? = fCG; CGPPg fCG; CNOg fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOgt.2.

The ways inwhich a contradiction can be derived in networks labelled by relations of M99, based on theintersections of relations (except the empty relation which obviously generates a contradic-tion by itself) are: a) CG CGPPb) CG CNOc) CG fCGPP; CNOgd) CG fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOge) CGPP CGPP 1f) CGPP CNOg) CGPP fCG; CGPP 1gh) CGPP fCG; CNOgi) CGPP fCGPP 1; CNOgl) CGPP fCG; CGPP 1; CNOgm) CNO fCG; CGPPgn) fCG; CGPPg fCGPP 1; CNOgThis is simply obtained by considering all pairs of relations in M99 whose intersection isempty.In G99 the contradictions are only:fCG; CGPPg fCG; CGPPg ^ fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOg andfCG; CGPPg fCG; CNOg fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOg .Henceforth we represent the relation fCG; CGPPg by -, the relation fCG; CNOg by ./ and the relation fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOg by 6 . Since any path in which labels are all -corresponds to the representation of - between each pair of vertices in the path, and - ./ = -, the possible expressions for contradictions in G99 are (-n - n) 6 and (-n - (n k) ./ - k) 6 . Hence, a cycle (-n - n) is called a --cycle, while a cycle(-n - (n k) ./ - k) is called a quasi --cycle. The graph representation of thesetwo di erent contradictory situations in G99 is showed in Figure 5. A --cycle and a quasi--cycle, in M99 force the elements involved in the cycle to be all in the relation CG .We can now show that the contradictions represented in G99 are the only contradictionswhich can be obtained by the implementation suggested in Lemma 5. This is very important,because we may perform consistency checking by simply checking all cycles. This result isstated in the next lemma.Lemma 6 Given a network of constraints T on M99, T is inconsistent i 99(T ) containseither a --cycle of a quasi --cycle, and two vertices of one cycle are connected by an edgelabelled by 6 . 375\nCristaniProof (Sketch)Case by case, the contradictions from a) to n), as in the table above, generate one of thetwo situations of the claim.For example, the contradiction a) CG CGPP , generates(fCG; CGPPg fCG; CGPPg ^ ) (fCG; CGPPg fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOg )which is a --cycle in which two vertices are connected by an edge labelled by 6 , as statedin the claim. All the other cases behave in the same way as can be easily checked by thereader.Conversely, if a contradiction derives from one of the possible implicit ways of repre-senting relations in M99, the implementation also produces one of the cases of the claim.In particular we have that, in M99, CGn = CG , CGPPn = CGPP , (CGPP 1)n = CGPP 1 ,fCG;CGPPgn = fCG; CGPPg and fCG;CGPP 1gn = fCG; CGPP 1g are the only idem-potent relations. The other cases of implicitness can be obtained by considering all the14 14 = 196 pairs of relations inM99, composing and intersecting them. The implicit casesarising thus are listed in below.i.1. CG = fCG; CGPPgn fCG; CGPP 1gni.2. CG = fCG; CGPPgn fCG; CNOgi.3. CGPP = fCG; CGPPgn fCGPP; CNOgi.4. CNO = fCG; CNOg fCGPP; CNOgi.5. CNO = fCGPP; CNOg fCGPP 1; CNOgi.6. CNO = fCGPP; CNOg fCG; CGPP 1; CNOgi.7. fCG; CNOg = fCG; CGPP; CNOg fCG; CGPP 1; CNOgi.8. fCGPP; CNOg = CGPPn CNOi.9. fCGPP; CNOg = CGPPn fCG; CNOgi.10. fCGPP; CNOg = CGPPn fCG; CGPP; CNOgi.11. fCGPP; CNOg = fCG; CGPPgn CNOi.12. fCGPP; CNOg = fCG; CGPP; CNOg fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOgi.13. fCG; CGPP; CNOg = fCG; CGPPgn fCG; CNOgReaders may directly express in G99 each of these relations along with the corresponding376\nThe Complexity of Reasoning about Spatial Congruence\nFigure 5: Contradictions in G99: fg indicates ? and R, S, T respectively fCG; CGPPg,fCG; CNOg and fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOg.relation producing a contradiction in M99 and they immediately verify the existence of --cycles or quasi --cycle where one pair of vertices is connected by an edge labelled by 6 forthese generated graphs.For example if we express CG as implicit relation by i.1. as in table above (formed byrelations in G99), CGPP as implicit relation by i.3. and fCGPP; CNOg by 99 as in t.8.,and consider the contradiction CG CGPP we obtain a quasi --cycle where two verticesare connected by an edge labelled by 6 . Similarly we can derive the other cases. We can now exhibit an algorithm which looks for --cycles and quasi --cycles, andchecks about pairs of a cycle being connected by an edge labelled by 6 .In Figure 7 an algorithm able to solve the Consistency Checking Problem for networksof constraints labelled by relations in M99 is presented. Based on Lemma 6 we can provethe following theorem.Theorem 5 Algorithm M99-CONSISTENCY correctly decides the consistency of a net-work of constraints T on M99 in O(n2) steps where n is the number of vertices of T .ProofBy Lemma 6 we can ensure the correctness of Algorithm M99-CONSISTENCY. The com-plexity of the algorithm can be derived from the fact that the computation of strongly377\nCristani\nFigure 6: Contradictions in M99: R, S, T respectively indicate fCG; CGPPg,fCG; CNOg and fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOg.

An immediate consequence of Theorem 5 is the following theorem:Theorem 6 MSAT(M99) is polynomial.The subalgebras of MC-4 included in M99 are in Table 10 of Appendix A.4.3 The Maximal Tractable Subclass M81The problem of deciding the consistency of a network of constraints on MC-4 is tractable,by means of Tables 6, 7, 8 and 10 for 85 subalgebras. The remainder is formed by 17subalgebras, each of these can be either tractable or intractable. The setM81 = f ?, CG, CGPP, CGPP 1, fCG; CGPPg, fCG; CGPP 1g, fCGPP; CGPP 1g,fCG;CGPP; CGPP 1g, fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOg, >gcontains all these subalgebras, so that if M81 is tractable all these algebras are as well.By analogy with the schema of the previous section we look for a small generator setfor M81. This is G81 = ffCG; CGPPg, fCG;CGPP; CGPP 1g, fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOgg.The following lemma states the properties of M81 with respect to G81.Lemma 7 dG81 =M81.ProofThe following expressions represent valid implementations of relations in M81 using onlyelements of G81 and the operators of composition, intersection and converse.379\nCristanir.1. ? = fCG; CGPPg fCG; CGPPg ^ fCGPP; CGPP 1; CNOgr.2.

All the other cases behave in the same way as can be easily checked by thereader.The only possible ways of representing implicit relations are provided by the schema of 81. Therefore the claim is proved. 380\nThe Complexity of Reasoning about Spatial Congruence\nFigure 8: Contradictions in M81.

We can show, in particular, the following claim.Theorem 7 Algorithm M81-CONSISTENCY correctly decides the consistency of a net-work of constraints T on M81 in O(n2) steps where n is the number of vertices of T .ProofBy Lemma 8 we can ensure the correctness of Algorithm M81-CONSISTENCY. The com-plexity of the algorithm can be derived from the fact that the computation of stronglyconnected components is a O(e) problem where e is the number of edges in the network.The 81 implementation adds, in the worst case, O(e0) edges, where e0 is the number ofedges in T , and therefore the number of edges in 81(T ) is O(2 e0), which is clearly O(n2). An immediate consequence of Theorem 3 is the followingTheorem 8 MSAT(M81) is polynomial.The subalgebras included in M81 are in Table 9 of Appendix A.5. ConclusionsWe presented a classi cation of tractability which is complete for the spatial algebra MC-4.This classi cation states that there exist three maximal tractable subalgebras M72, M99and M81 which include 92 out of 102 expressive subalgebras of MC-4.The interest in a complete classi cations of tractability, as already observed by Jonssonand Drakengren (1997), is determined by the need for a de nition of the boundary betweentractable and intractable problems. Nebl (1999) has suggested that the knowledge of thisboundary can be used either as preprocessing step and as a way to structure the backtrackingsearch on such algebras.The provision of a complete classi cation is one step in researching about constraintalgebras. A next step is the individuation of useful heuristics which give improvements in theperformances of various techniques. We are currently exploiting the use of these techniquesin association with techniques based on the classi cation presented in this paper to obtaine cient reasoning algorithms which can be used in practice. Preliminary results on path-consistency are encouraging, but we cannot yet guarantee the percentage of improvement,since the algebra MC-4 is so simply structured that for networks randomly chosen it is veryhard to obtain a case where inconsistency is not detectable by path-consistency.AcknowledgementsI would like to thank Elena Mutinelli who developed her Laurea Thesis (Mutinelli, 1998)on the theme of complexity of reasoning about congruence and rst discussed preliminary382\nThe Complexity of Reasoning about Spatial Congruenceresults which I used for developing the classi cation of this paper.

The speci c stress on qualitative reasoning about space, as observed by Zimmermann (1995), is justi ed by the fact that qualitative spatial relations can be treated as e ciently as their quantitative counterparts, but they seem to be closer to the model of relations humans adopt for spatial reasoning. Even though qualitative spatial reasoning has an extended literature, in spite of its relatively short history, certain aspects of the discipline have been neglected. In particular, no exhaustive computational perspective has been developed on qualitative morphological reasoning about space. The term morphological reasoning is intended to suggest reasoning about the internal structure of the objects. In the case of spatial reasoning this includes reasoning about the size, shape and internal topology of spatial regions. The purpose of the present work is to analyse the complexity of reasoning about relations of congruence, either actual or partial, between spatial regions, using the spatial algebra MC-4 which has been preliminarly analysed by Cristani (1997).

The MC-4 algebra, we describe in this paper, is structured in the same way as the Algebra of Partially Ordered Time (PO-time algebra), studied by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez. We would like to stress two main aspects here: The MC-4 algebra has the PO-time algebra are the same algebraic structure: the discussion of this paper stands a di erent interpretation of the PO-time algebra, even di erent from the spatial interpretation provided by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez in their papers. The computational results we present here can be applied to the PO-time algebra as well, and they extend the previous ndings obtained by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez. In particular Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez (1998, 1999), proved that path-consistency is insu cient to ensure consistency for relations in this algebra, and that there exists a tractable subalgebra of it which can be treated by an O(n3) algorithm. Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez (1999), showed that deciding the consistency of a PO-time network is an NP-complete problem by reducing to it the analogous decision problem on RCC-5.", "startOffset": 156, "endOffset": 2833}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "The RCC model corresponds to subalgebras of Interval Calculus, as stated by Bennett (1994).

The backtracking technique is applicable to MC-4 as well, so we can perform a polynomial solution of MSAT on nondeterministic machines. This shows that MSAT is in NP, and allows us to claim: Theorem 2 MSAT(MC-4) is NP-complete. Because of this negative result a deep investigation is needed to de ne tractable subclasses of the set of 16 relations which allow us to perform polynomial analysis for at least a subset of the networks of constraints de nable on MC-4. In this paper we give the de nition of the three maximal tractable subclasses of MC4, exhibiting therefore a complete classi cation of tractability for the algebra.
