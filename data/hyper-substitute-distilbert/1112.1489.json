To simulate such an ability of human problem solving, Granular Computing (GrC) was proposed. In fact, there have existed many concrete models of granular computing, such as computing with words [17][18], rough set theory [12], formal concept analysis [8], quotient space theory [19], etc.\nGranulation [18][10], grouping some elements of the domain into granules, is a fundamental step towards granular computing. Idealized granulation should yield pairwise disjoint granules such as equivalence classes or partition blocks. However, incompleteness and impreciseness of information, as well as variant similarity of individuals, always result in overlapping among granules. Consequently, granular worlds are always formalized as a set equipped with a family of nonempty subsets whose union equals to the universe, which is precisely the covering model [10].\nFor any given covering, both union and intersection of covering blocks containing the given element can be viewed as induced granules, which form two new coverings representing granular worlds at different abstraction levels. Consequently, transformations among these three covering are important and interesting in that they simulate the process of switching among granularities, which are precisely our respect of discussion.\nPawlak\u2019s roughs set provides a concrete framework performing granular computing based on partition or equivalence relation, however, absolute disjointness among granules restrict applications of classical rough set theory, so generalized rough set models based on covering are extensively researched, and many results such as axiomization and reduction theory are obtained (see, for example, in [20][21][22][23] for details). In these researches, union and intersection of covering blocks containing the given element were always called the friend and neighborhood, respectively, and they were exploited as basic knowledge to approximate unknown knowledge. However, transformations among induced granular worlds as well as relational interpretations of friend and neighborhood are not discussed, while the latter naturally results in axiomization of several types of covering based rough approximation operators.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Based on the definition of star and closure of an element, two granular worlds are induced in section 2, and transformations among them are also discussed. Section 3 investigates axiomization and relational interpretation of four types of covering rough approximation operators, and it is proved that these operators exploit induced granules, rather than given covering blocks, as basic knowledge to approximate unknown knowledge. Conclusions and discussions are grouped in the final section.\nThroughout this paper, we do not restrict the universe of discourse U to be finite. The class of all subsets of U will be denoted by \u2118(U). For any X \u2286 U , \u2212X will be used to denote the complement of X . For any subset system F \u2286 \u2118(U), we will denote {\u2212F | F \u2208 F} as Fc. Obviously, (Fc)c = F . Moreover, I always denotes arbitrary index set."}, {"heading": "2 Granular Worlds Induced by Covering", "text": "In this section, we firstly recall the star and point closure system of any given covering, and then we discuss transformations among these three subset systems.

Obviously, covering generalizes partition in that overlapping among covering blocks are permitted. For any x \u2208 U , let \u03b2x denote the collection of covering blocks containing x, namely \u03b2x = {B| x \u2208 B \u2208 \u03b2}.\nDefinition 1 ([3][6]). For any x \u2208 U , the star and point closure of x with respect to \u03b2, denoted by star(x, \u03b2) and \u2193x, are defined as the union and intersection of covering blocks containing x, respectively.\nFormally, \u2200x \u2208 U , star(x, \u03b2) = \u22c3 {B| B \u2208 \u03b2x} and \u2193x = \u22c2 {B| B \u2208 \u03b2x}. In [22][20], star(x, \u03b2) and \u2193x are called friend and neighborhood of x, and denoted by Friends(x) and Neighbor(x), respectively. In the followings, the collection of stars and point closures with respect to covering \u03b2 are denoted by S(\u03b2) and P(\u03b2), namely S(\u03b2) = {star(x, \u03b2)| x \u2208 U} and P(\u03b2) = {\u2193x| x \u2208 U}. Both the star system and the point closure system are coverings of U since x \u2208 star(x, \u03b2) and x \u2208\u2193x hold for any x \u2208 U .\nDefinition 2 ([3]). For any coverings \u03b1 and \u03b2, if for any A \u2208 \u03b1 there exists B \u2208 \u03b2 such that A \u2286 B, then \u03b1 is called a refinement of \u03b2, denoted by \u03b2 \u2291 \u03b1.\nProposition 1. S(\u03b2) \u2291 \u03b2 \u2291 P(\u03b2).\nFor any x \u2208 U , star(x, \u03b2) and \u2193x are regarded as granules of different grain size, then Proposition 1 implies that the two induced coverings represent granular worlds at different abstraction levels.\nDefinition 3 ([6]). For any covering \u03b2, the specialization preordering \u03b2 induced by \u03b2 is defined as: \u2200x, y \u2208 U , y \u03b2 x \u21d4 (\u2200K \u2208 \u03b2)(x \u2208 K \u2192 y \u2208 K).\nIn general, specialization preordering \u03b2 is reflexive and transitive but not necessarily antisymmetric. Moreover, point closure \u2193 x is precisely the principal down-set {y| y \u03b2 x} generated by x with respect to \u03b2. The following Proposition 2 characterizes the structure of P(\u03b2).\nProposition 2. For any covering \u03b2 of U , \u2200x, y \u2208 U , then\n1. y \u2208\u2193x if and only if \u2193y \u2286\u2193x. 2. \u2193x = \u22c3 {\u2193z| z \u2208\u2193x}, \u2193x = \u22c2 {\u2193z| x \u2208\u2193z}.\nFor further discussion, we need to recall some notations about binary relation. For any binary relation R on U and x \u2208 U , R(x) = {y \u2208 U | xRy} and R\u22121 = {\u3008v, u\u3009| uRv}. Particularly, when \u2264 is a partial ordering or preordering, \u2264\u22121 is always called the dual of \u2264 and denoted by \u2265. Moreover, \u2191x = {y \u2208 U | x \u2264 y} and \u2193x = {y \u2208 U | y \u2264 x} are called principal up-set and principal down-set generated by x, respectively [6].\nFor any covering \u03b2, the subset system \u03b2c = {\u2212B| B \u2208 \u03b2} is not necessarily a covering of U any more. In fact, \u03b2c is also a covering of U if and only if\u22c2 {B| B \u2208 \u03b2} = \u2205, or equivalently, there exist B \u2208 \u03b2 such that x /\u2208 B holds for any x \u2208 U . However, the specialization preordering \u03b2c can be still defined, and we have the following proposition characterizing the relationship between \u03b2 and \u03b2c .\nProposition 3 ([6]). For any covering \u03b2 of U , the specialization preordering \u03b2c is precisely the dual of \u03b2, namely \u03b2c= \u03b2.\nDefinition 4 ([6]). For any covering \u03b2 of U , x \u2208 U , the point closure of x with respect to the subset system \u03b2c is called the core of x, denoted by \u2191x.\nFor any x \u2208 U , \u2191x = \u22c2 {D| x \u2208 D \u2208 \u03b2c} and P(\u03b2c) = {\u2191x| x \u2208 U}. It is easy to verify that \u2191x is precisely the principal up-set {y \u2208 U | x \u03b2 y} generated by x with respect to \u03b2. Note that P(\u03b2c) is also a covering of U since x \u2208\u2191x holds for any x \u2208 U .\nAny covering \u03b2 can also induces a binary relation T\u03b2 determined by \u22c3 {B \u00d7 B| B \u2208 \u03b2}. Moreover, \u2200x \u2208 U , T\u03b2(x) = star(x, \u03b2). Then we have the following relational characterizations of the three induced coverings.\nTheorem 1. For any covering \u03b2, point closure systems P(\u03b2) = { \u03b2(x)|x \u2208 U}, P(\u03b2c) = { \u03b2(x)| x \u2208 U}, and star system S(\u03b2) = {T\u03b2(x)| x \u2208 U}."}, {"heading": "2.2 Transformations among Induced Granular Worlds", "text": "Note that, according to Proposition 1, P transforms a coarser granular world into finer one, while S transforms a finer granular world into coarser one, so they can be understood as unary operations on covering simulating the process of switching among different granular worlds. Proposition 2 only tells us that P(P(\u03b2)) = P(\u03b2), namely P is an idempotent operation. To completely understand these transformations, we need to study P and S further.\nFor any covering \u03b2, T\u03b2 is a tolerance, a binary relation satisfying reflexivity and symmetry [1]. Theorem 1 implies that tolerance relation will be an useful tool to investigate properties of S, so we will firstly recall some basic definitions and facts about tolerance relation.\nLet T be any tolerance relation on U , x \u2208 U , the T -relative set T (x) is always called T -class, and we will denote the family of all T -classes as C(T ), namely C(T ) = {T (x)|x \u2208 U}. Obviously, C(T ) is an covering induced by T , and for any covering \u03b2, S(\u03b2) = C(T\u03b2).\nA T -preblock is any subset B \u2286 U such that xTy holds for any x, y \u2208 B. Any subset B \u2286 U is called a T -block if and only if it is a T -preblock such that for any x /\u2208 B, there exists b \u2208 B satisfying \u00ac(bTx). In the current paper, the family of all T -blocks will be denoted as B(T ), which is also an induced covering by T . It is well known that there exists one-to-one correspondence between the collection of all tolerance relations and the collection of all T -blocks on U . Moreover, we have the following Proposition 4, which not only characterizes the relationship between T -classes and T -blocks, but also implies that C(T ) = S(B(T )).\nProposition 4 ([1]). Let (U, T ) be any tolerance space, x \u2208 U , B \u2208 B(T ), then T (x) = \u22c3 {B| x \u2208 B}, B = \u22c2 {T (x)| x \u2208 B}.\nFor any tolerance space (U, T ) and x \u2208 U , the intersection of T -classes containing x was called compatibility kernel \u3008x\u3009T in [5], namely \u3008x\u3009T = \u22c2 {T (y)|x \u2208 T (y)}, and the family of all compatibility kernels was denoted by \u3008U\u3009T . Obviously, \u3008x\u3009T =\u2193x, in which \u2193x is the point closure of x with respect to covering C(T ). Furthermore, we have \u3008U\u3009T = P(C(T )). It was also proved in [5] that \u3008x\u3009T = \u22c2 {B| x \u2208 B \u2208 B(T )}, or equivalently, P(B(T )) = P(C(T )). So in the following, the point closure system P(T ) of a tolerance relation T is always referred to P(B(T )) or P(C(T )).\nProposition 5. Let (U, T ) be any tolerance space, x, y \u2208 U , B \u2208 B(T ), then\n1. B = \u22c3 {\u2193y| y \u2208 B}, T (x) = \u22c3 {\u2193y| y \u2208 T (x)}. 2. \u22c3 {\u2193y| x \u2208\u2193y} \u2286 T (x).\nThe proofs of the above proposition is trivial, however, it should be pointed out that \u22c3 {\u2193y| x \u2208\u2193y} \u2287 T (x) does not hold in general. Now we turn to discuss the relationship between P(S(\u03b2)) and P(\u03b2).\nProposition 6. For any covering \u03b2 of U , P(S(\u03b2)) = P(T\u03b2) \u2291 P(\u03b2). Furthermore, if \u03b2 is precisely B(T ) with respect to tolerance T , then P(S(\u03b2)) = P(\u03b2).\nProof. It is sufficient to prove that \u2193x \u2286 \u3008x\u3009T\u03b2 holds for any x \u2208 U . Note that y \u2208\u2193x \u21d4 \u2200B \u2208 \u03b2(x \u2208 B \u2192 y \u2208 B), then if x \u2208 T\u03b2(z) = \u22c3 {B| z \u2208 B \u2208 \u03b2}, there must exists B0 \u2208 \u03b2 such that x \u2208 B0 and z \u2208 B0. So y \u2208 B0 and z \u2208 B0 holds, which follows that y \u2208 T\u03b2(z). Hence, \u2200z \u2208 U(x \u2208 T\u03b2(z) \u2192 y \u2208 T\u03b2(z)), namely \u2193x \u2286 \u3008x\u3009T\u03b2 .\nIf \u03b2 is precisely B(T ) with respect to tolerance relation T , then \u2193x = \u3008x\u3009T\u03b2 holds for any x \u2208 U .\nRemark 1. The converse of proposition 6 is not true in general. Let U = {1, 2, 3} and \u03b2 = {{1, 3}, {2, 3}, {3}}, then \u2193x = \u3008x\u3009 holds for any x \u2208 U , however, \u03b2 is not the family of tolerance blocks at all.\nFor any tolerance relation T , C(T ), B(T ) and P(T ) are all coverings of U induced by T , which represent granular worlds at different abstraction level. We also have known that P(C(T )) = P(T ) = P(B(T )) and S(B(T )) = C(T ). In general, however, TP(T )(x) \u2286 T (x) for any x \u2208 U , or equivalently C(T ) \u2291 S(P(T )), in which TP(T ) denotes the tolerance relation induced by P(T ) = {\u3008x\u3009T |x \u2208 U}. The following theorem characterizes sufficient and necessary condition of S(P(T )) = C(T ), or equivalently T = TP(T ).\nTheorem 2 ([5]). For any tolerance relation T , then TP(T ) = T if and only if, for any a, b \u2208 U , aT b implies that there exists c \u2208 U such that a \u2208 \u3008c\u3009T and b \u2208 \u3008c\u3009T .\nAn interesting conclusion of Proposition 6 and Theorem 2 is S(P(S(P(\u03b1)))) = S(P(\u03b1)) holds for any covering \u03b1, which implies that the composition of P and S is also idempotent.\nTheorem 3. For any covering \u03b1 of U , we denote P(\u03b1) by \u03b2, then TP(T\u03b2) = T\u03b2.\nProof. Note that P(P(\u03b1)) = P(\u03b1) and \u03b2 = P(\u03b1), then \u2193\u03b1x =\u2193\u03b2x ,\u2193x, in which \u2193\u03b1x and \u2193\u03b2x denote the point closure of x with respect to \u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively. By the proof of Proposition 6, \u2193x \u2286 \u3008x\u3009T\u03b2 holds for any x \u2208 U .\nFor any a, b \u2208 U , since T\u03b2(x) = \u22c3 {\u2193y|x \u2208\u2193y}, if aT\u03b2b then there exists c \u2208 U such that a \u2208\u2193c and b \u2208\u2193c, so a \u2208 \u3008c\u3009T\u03b2 and b \u2208 \u3008c\u3009T\u03b2 . According to Theorem 2, we have TP(T\u03b2) = T\u03b2."}, {"heading": "3 Applications to Covering Rough Approximation", "text": "This section mainly discusses some applications of our multi-granular perspectives on covering. we firstly recall relationship between quasi-discrete closure operator and binary relation, and then discuss relational interpretations as well as axiomizations of four types of covering rough approximation operators."}, {"heading": "3.1 Ce\u030cch Closure Operators", "text": "Closure operators in the sense of Ce\u030cch [3][7] generalize topological ones in that idempotent axiom does not necessarily holds.\nDefinition 5 ([3][7]).

Let T\u03b2 be the induced tolerance relation of covering \u03b2, \u2200X \u2286 U , then FH(X) = Cl\u03b2(X) and FL(X) = Int\u03b2(X), in which Cl\u03b2 and Int\u03b2 are Ce\u030cch quasi-discrete closure and interior operators bijectively corresponding to tolerance relation T\u03b2, respectively.\nProposition 10 implies that FH and FL are generalized rough upper and lower approximation operators based on tolerance relation T\u03b2 , or equivalently, granules T\u03b2(x) = star(x, \u03b2) of induced granular world S(\u03b2) are exploited as basic knowledge blocks to approximate uncertain knowledge. Furthermore, we have the following axiomatic characterization of FH .\nTheorem 5. For any mapping H : \u2118(U) \u2192 \u2118(U), \u2200x, y \u2208 U , X \u2286 U and Xi \u2286 U (\u2200i \u2208 I), then H satisfies the following properties (1H)-(4H):\n(1H) H(\u2205) = \u2205 (2H) X \u2286 H(X) (3H) H( \u22c3 Xi) = \u22c3 H(Xi)\n(4H) y \u2208 H(x) \u21d4 x \u2208 H(y) if and only if there exists a covering \u03b2 such that H = FH.\nProof. Suppose H satisfies properties (1H)-(4H). We define T \u2286 U \u00d7 U : \u2200x, y \u2208 U , xTy \u21d4 y \u2208 H(x), then T is tolerance relation and T (x) = H(x) holds for any x \u2208 U . Let \u03b2 = B(T ), then FH = ClT\u03b2 and FH(x) = \u22c3 {B \u2208 \u03b2| x \u2208 B} = T (x) = H(x). Furthermore, considering the quasi-discreteness of ClT\u03b2 , \u2200X \u2286 U , we have FH(X) = \u22c3 FH(x) = \u22c3 H(x) = H(X), which follows FH = H .\nBy Proposition 10, FH(X) = Cl\u03b2(X) holds for any X \u2286 U , so the proof of the sufficiency is trivial.\nRemark 2. In the proof of sufficiency, the covering \u03b2 is not unique. For example, the family of binary subsets {x, y} such that y \u2208 H(x) is chosen as the covering \u03b2 in [20].\nThe second type of covering rough approximation operators can be regarded as a special case of the first ones in the sense that the covering is an induced point closure system, however, their axiomatic characterization are different.\nDefinition 8 ([21][20]). For any covering \u03b2, operators SH, SL : \u2118(U) \u2192 \u2118(U) are defined as follows: \u2200X \u2286 U ,\nSH(X) = \u22c3 {\u2193x| \u2193x \u22c2 X 6= \u2205}\nSL(X) = {x \u2208 U | \u2200y \u2208 U(x \u2208\u2193y \u2192\u2193y \u2286 X)} We call SH, SL the second type of covering upper and lower operators, respectively.\nThen, in a completely similar way, we have the following Proposition 11 and Proposition 12.\nProposition 11. For any covering \u03b2 of U , let TP(\u03b2) denote the induced tolerance relation, then \u2200X \u2286 U ,\nSH(X) = {x \u2208 U | TP(\u03b2)(x) \u22c2 X 6= \u2205} SL(X) = {x \u2208 U | TP(\u03b2)(x) \u2286 X}\nProposition 12. For any X \u2286 U , SH(X) = ClP(\u03b2)(X) and SL(X) = IntP(\u03b2)(X), in which ClP(\u03b2) and IntP(\u03b2) are Ce\u030cch quasi-discrete closure and interior operators bijectively corresponding to TP(\u03b2), respectively.\nProposition 12 implies that SH and SL are generalized rough upper/lower approximation operators based on tolerance relation TP(\u03b2), or equivalently, granules TP(\u03b2)(x) of induced granular world S(P(\u03b2)) are basic knowledge blocks.\nTheorem 6. Let H : \u2118(U) \u2192 \u2118(U), \u2200x, y \u2208 U , X \u2286 U and Xi \u2286 U holds for any i of arbitrary index set I, then there exists a covering \u03b2 such that H = SH if and only if H satisfies (1H)-(4H) and the following property (5H):\n(5H) if y \u2208 H(x), there exists u \u2208 U such that x, y \u2208 \u22c2 {H(z)| u \u2208 H(z)}\nProof. Suppose H satisfies properties (1H)-(4H). We define T \u2286 U \u00d7 U : \u2200x, y \u2208 U , xTy \u21d4 y \u2208 H(x), then T is tolerance relation and T (x) = H(x) holds for any x \u2208 U . Note that \u3008x\u3009T = \u22c2 {H(z)| x \u2208 H(z)}, so according to Theorem 2, we have T = TP(T ). Let \u03b2 = B(T ), then TP(\u03b2) = TP(T ) = T , so for any x \u2208 U , SH(x) = \u22c3 {\u2193 y| x \u2208\u2193 y} = T (x) = H(x). Considering the quasi-discreteness of ClP(\u03b2), we have SH(X) = \u22c3 {SH(x)| x \u2208 X} = \u22c3 {H(x)| x \u2208 X} = H(X), which follows SH = H . Suppose \u03b2 be any covering of U , then SH = ClP(\u03b2). According to Theorem 5, SH satisfies axioms (1H)-(4H); Moreover, by theorem 2 and theorem 3, SH also satisfies axiom (5H).\nRemark 3. It should be pointed out that the covering \u03b2 is also not unique in the proof of sufficient condition. For example, the family of subsets {H(x)|x \u2208 U} is chosen as the covering \u03b2 in [20].\nThe third type of covering based rough approximation operators on finite universe was defined in [22], however, the upper and the lower approximation operator were not dual. In the following, we will discuss the third type of covering based upper approximation operator and its dual, and our results also apply to infinite universe [11].\nDefinition 9 ([22]). For any covering \u03b2 of U , operators TH, TL : P (U) \u2192 P (U) are defined as follows: \u2200X \u2286 U ,\nTH(X) = \u22c3 { \u2193x| x \u2208 X}\nTL(X) = {x \u2208 U | \u2200u(x \u2208\u2193u \u2192\u2193u \u2286 X)} We call TH, TL the third type of covering upper and lower operators, respectively.\nProposition 13. For any covering \u03b2 of U , \u2200X \u2286 U , TH(X) = {x \u2208 U | \u2191x \u22c2 X 6= \u2205}\nTL(X) = {x \u2208 U | \u2191x \u2286 X}\nProof. For anyX \u2286 U , then TH(X) = \u22c3 {\u2193y|y \u2208 X} = {x \u2208 U |\u2203y \u2208 X(x \u2208\u2193y)} = {x \u2208 U | \u2191x \u22c2 X 6= \u2205}. Dually, TL(X) = {x \u2208 U | \u2191x \u2286 X}.\nAccording to Theorem 1, \u2191x = \u03b2(x), then operators TH and TL are in fact Ce\u030cch quasi-discrete closure and interior operators bijectively corresponding to the reflexive and transitive relation \u03b2 .\nProposition 14. For any X \u2286 U , TH(X) = Cl \u03b2 (X), TL(X) = Int \u03b2 (X).\nTheorem 7. Let H : P (U) \u2192 P (U), X \u2286 U , Xi \u2286 U(\u2200i \u2208 I), then H satisfies the following properties (H1)-(H4):\n(H1) H(\u2205) = \u2205 (H2) X \u2286 H(X) (H3) H( \u22c3 Xi) = \u22c3 H(Xi)\n(H4) H(H(X)) = H(X) if and only if there exists a covering \u03b2 such that H = TH.\nProof. For any covering \u03b2, TH = Cl \u03b2 , which follows that TH satifies properties (H1)-(H4).\nSuppose H satisfies properties (H1)-(H4) and \u2200x \u2208 U By property (H2) then x \u2208 H(x) holds, which follows that \u03b2 = {H(u)| u \u2208 U} is a covering of U . By property (H4), H(H(x)) = H(x) and \u2193 x = \u22c2 {H(y)| x \u2208 H(y)} = H(x), so TH(x) = {y| \u2191y \u22c2 {x} 6= \u2205} = {y| x \u2208\u2191y} =\u2193x. For any X \u2286 U , by the quasidiscreteness of TH as well as the property (H3), then TH(X) = \u22c3 {TH(x)| x \u2208 X} = \u22c3 {H(x)| x \u2208 X} = H(X).\nThe fourth type of covering based rough approximation operators was defined in [15][23], and [4][14] discussed a special case in that the covering is precisely B(T ) of given tolerance relation T . In [11][15], it was proved that the fourth type of operators are equivalent to rough approximation operators based on preordering relation.\nDefinition 10 ([23]). For any covering \u03b2 of U , operators XH,XL : P (U) \u2192 P (U) are defined as follows: \u2200X \u2286 U ,\nXH(X) = {x \u2208 U | \u2193x \u22c2 X 6= \u2205}\nXL(X) = {x \u2208 U | \u2193x \u2286 X} We call XH, XL the fourth type of covering upper and lower operators, respectively.\nAccording to Theorem 1, \u2193x = \u03b2 (x), so we have the following topological interpretation of XH and XL.\nProposition 15. For any X \u2286 U , XH(X) = Cl \u03b2 (X), XL(X) = Int \u03b2 (X).\nTheorem 8. Let H : P (U) \u2192 P (U), \u2200x, y \u2208 U , X \u2286 U and Xi \u2286 U holds for any i of arbitrary index set I, then H satisfies properties (H1)-(H4) if and only if there exists a covering \u03b2 such that H = XH.\nProof. Suppose H satisfies properties (H1)-(H4). Let \u03b2 = {Kc|H(K) = K}, then \u03b2 is a covering of U since H(\u2205) = \u2205, and \u2200x \u2208 U , it is easy to verify that the point closure of x with respect to \u03b2c is precisely H(x), and that XH(x) =\u2191x, the core of x with respect to \u03b2, so XH(x) = H(x). For any X \u2286 U , by the quasidiscreteness of XH and property (H3), we have XH(X) =\n\u22c3 {XH(x)|x \u2208 X} =\u22c3\n{H(x)| x \u2208 X} = H(X).\nNote that the third and fourth types of upper approximation operators have the same axiomatic characterization, however, the corresponding coverings are different."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "Any covering can be associated with at least two new ones: point closure system and star system, both of which have obvious relational interpretation. The paper understands these coverings as granular worlds at different abstraction level, and investigates typical properties of transformations among these granular worlds.\nAs an application of the presented multi-granular perspectives on covering, four types of covering based rough approximation operators are proved to be induced by binary relations, which, to some extent, bridges the gap between generalized rough sets based on binary relation and coverings. Furthermore, axiomaic characterizations of these four types of upper approximation operators are obtained, and these results can be dually apply to lower ones."}], "references": [{"title": "On the Coverings by Tolerance Classes", "author": ["W.
