The classical coherence criterion then states that, for the gambles she faces, she should choose her previsions\u2014interpreted as fair prices\u2014so as to avoid a sure loss (de Finetti 1974\u20131975; Walley 1991, \u00a72.8).1 The resulting coherent previsions are linear expectation operators.\nNow, let us allow our subject to be more cautious and specify possibly non-coinciding lower and upper previsions\u2014 interpreted as supremum acceptable buying and infimum acceptable selling prices. A modified coherence condition has to be used to accommodate this (Walley 1991, \u00a72.5). The resulting coherent lower previsions are nonlinear expectation operators. (The so-called conjugacy relationship between lower and upper previsions allows us, in all generality, to only consider one of both.)\nCoherent lower previsions are, as models of uncertainty, equivalent to convex sets of coherent previsions, or credal\n1Terminology: a gamble is the same thing as a bet or a random variable; a sure loss corresponds to a Dutch book or arbitrage.\nsets. Mathematically, they generalize classical probabilities, possibility distributions, and belief functions, among others. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest from the artificial intelligence community for this general type of model\u2014in both incarnations: credal sets and lower or upper previsions\u2014as regards theory as well as applications (see, e.g., Cozman et al. 2004; De Cooman & Zaffalon 2003; De Cooman et al. 2008; Gr\u00fcnwald & Halpern 2008). This paper\u2019s contribution lies mostly in the theoretical realm; results are derived and presented using lower previsions, but some illustrations will make good use of credal sets.\nWe restrict attention to finite sets of simple gambles, i.e., which take only a finite number of values, so that we can consider them as essentially defined on finite possibility spaces (Walley 1991, \u00a74.2.1). In such a context, the set of linear previsions can be represented by the unit simplex of probability mass functions on the possibility space of elementary events. It is completely characterized by both (a) a finite number of linear constraints: the probability\nmass on each elementary event is nonnegative and it sums up to one for the whole possibility space; and (b) a finite number of extreme linear previsions: those that correspond to the degenerate probability mass functions, which are one on a single elementary event and zero elsewhere\u2014the vertices of the unit simplex.\nNo similar pair of characterizations was known for coherent lower previsions. In this paper, we present (a) a finitary formulation of the coherence criterion for\nlower previsions that\u2014when used as an algorithm\u2014 generates a finite set of linear constraints that are sufficient to guarantee coherence (but which may contain constraints that are not strictly necessary); and (b) a procedure that, starting from these constraints, can be used to obtain the finite set of extreme coherent lower previsions that characterizes the set of all coherent lower previsions on the given finite set of simple gambles. In general, it is not possible to represent a coherent lower prevision in a simpler way: e.g., both lower and upper probability mass functions and lower and upper probabilities are less expressive uncertainty models (Walley 1991, \u00a72.7).\nApart from the linear previsions, there are other special classes of coherent lower or upper previsions for which (one or) both characterizations are known. The most important ones are possibility distributions (Quaeghebeur 2009, \u00a72.2.7), belief functions (Br\u00fcning & Dennenberg 2008), and lower probabilities (Quaeghebeur & De Cooman 2008). The ideas of Quaeghebeur & De Cooman (2008) provided us with the foundations for this paper, which generalizes their results from an important subclass to the general case.\nThe two characterizations are two faces of the fact that the set of all coherent lower previsions\u2014regarded as vectors\u2014 is a convex polytope: On the one hand, a convex polytope is the intersection of a set of half-spaces, i.e., those defined by the hyperplanes in which its facets lie. On the other hand, it is the convex hull of its extreme points or vertices. So polytope theory will play an important supporting role in this paper (good references: Gr\u00fcnbaum 1967; Ziegler 1995).\nOverview We present the material as follows: In Section 2, we reformulate the standard coherence criterion into one that generates a finite sufficient set of constraints and in parallel explain the procedure to obtain extreme coherent lower previsions.2 In Section 3, we analyze the sets of constraints and extreme coherent lower previsions that we obtain when applying our results to different sets of gambles.3 We end with some conclusions.\nNotation The generic notation of the finite possibility space is \u2126 . An event A is one of its subsets and an elementary event \u03c9 is one of its elements.\nA gamble g is a real-valued function on \u2126 that maps an elementary event \u03c9 to a payoff g\u03c9 . (Parentheses are used for grouping, but not for function application.) The indicator IA of an event A is the gamble that is one on A and zero elsewhere; I\u03c9 := I{\u03c9} is the singleton indicator of \u03c9 .\nA lower prevision P is a real-valued functional on a set of gambles K \u2014finite in this paper\u2014that maps each of its elements g to a lower prevision Pg, which can be seen as one of the components of the vector P in RK . The upper prevision P conjugate to a lower prevision P is defined by Pg = \u2212P(\u2212g). The vacuous lower prevision PA expressing ignorance relative to the event A is defined by PAg = min\u03c9\u2208A g\u03c9 . Similarly, for any elementary event \u03c9 , the degenerate prevision P\u03c9 is defined by P\u03c9 g = g\u03c9 .\nThe set of all linear previsions P is the convex hull of the set of degenerate previsions: P = co{P\u03c9 : \u03c9 \u2208\u2126}. So a linear prevision P is completely defined by its probability mass function p on \u2126 : P = \u2211\u03c9\u2208\u2126 p\u03c9 \u00b7P\u03c9 , where p\u03c9 = PI\u03c9 .\nWe use \u3008\u00b5,\u03c6\u3009X as a formal shorthand for bilinear expressions of the type \u2211x\u2208X \u00b5x \u00b7\u03c6x. Because of this, the identity function id that maps an object onto itself will be useful.\n2For proofs, see (Proofs). 3For implementation details and a compilation of resulting\noutput files, see (Implementation; Output)."}, {"heading": "2 COHERENCE CRITERION REFORMULATION", "text": "In this section, we first formulate the standard coherence criterion for lower previsions (\u00a72.1). Next, using a toy example, we introduce some useful concepts from polytope theory and the theory of coherent lower previsions (\u00a72.2).

A standard way to formalize coherence is (cf. Walley 1991, \u00a72.5, also for justifications): Definition 1. A lower prevision P on K is coherent iff \u3008\u03bb ,P\u3009N \u2212P f \u2264max(\u3008\u03bb , id\u3009N \u2212 f ) for all \u2022 gambles f in K , \u2022 subsets N of K , \u2022 coefficient vectors \u03bb in (R>0)N .

To get a finitary coherence criterion, i.e., one that generates only a finite number of constraints, the possible values of \u03bb need to be restricted to a finite number.\nBy playing with the normalization and sign of \u03bb -components we can obtain an equivalent, shorter formulation: Definition 2.

Consider a toy example, where \u2126 = {a,b,c} and K consists of two gambles, f := (1,1/2,0) and g := (0,2/3,1). Up to normalization, each constraint in (P f ,Pg)-space is completely determined by its coefficient vector \u03bb = (\u03bb f ,\u03bbg), so there is only one constraint for each orientation.\nWe have drawn a finite sufficient set of constraints at the top-left corner of the next page. Even with the maxnormalization used, the complete set of constraints would be infinite. Each constraint corresponds to a closed half-space, indicated by stubs drawn on the hyperplane delimiting it.

The constraints (0,\u22121), (\u22121,0), (1,3/4), and (2/3,1) form a necessary and sufficient set.\nDegenerate previsions are coherent lower previsions. So because \u3008\u03bb ,P\u03c9\u3009K = max\u3008\u03bb , id\u3009K for \u03c9 in argmax\u3008\u03bb , id\u3009K , all generated constraints are strict: the corresponding hyperplanes support the polytope. In our toy example, the only vertex apart from the degenerate previsions is the vacuous prevision P\u2126 . The other, non-vertex vacuous previsions, P{a,b} and P{b,c}, have been indicated as well.\nThe fact that a polytope can be represented both by an H-representation, a set of linear constraints (half-spaces), and a V-representation, a set of vertices (points), is expressed by the so-called Minkowski\u2013Weyl theorem (Ziegler 1995, Thm. 1.1). Going from the H-representation to the V-representation is called vertex enumeration; the other direction is called facet enumeration. Points that can be written as strict convex combinations of vertices and constraints that can be written as positive linear combinations of other constraints are redundant. Using this terminology, our endeavor, schematically, is the following:\nconstraint generation (definition of coherence)K\nH-representation\nV-representation\nredundancy removal\nvertex enumeration\nredundancy removal\nfacet enumeration\nIn between the minimal V-representation and the full vector\nP\u2126\nPa Pc Pb space view, as given above, there is the adjacency graph representation, in which neighboring vertices are connected by edges. It is useful for working with extreme coherent lower previsions. Our toy example\u2019s is given on the right.\nWhat we have here done by hand, enumerate the vertices of a polytope specified by a set of linear constraints and deduce the adjacency graph, can be done using publicly available polyhedral computation computer programs (e.g., Avis 2000; Fukuda & Prodon 1996).\nA standard way to represent a coherent lower prevision P is by using its credal set MP (Walley 1991, \u00a73.3). This set consists of all the linear previsions that dominate it: MP := {P \u2208P : P\u2264 P}; and P is its lower envelope: for all gambles g, Pg = minP\u2208MP Pg. The set P is the unit simplex in R\u2126 and each one of its points corresponds to a probability mass function. The credal set of a coherent lower prevision P is the convex subset of P determined by the linear constraints corresponding to its values.\nP\u2126\nP f = 0\nPg = 0\nP f = 1\nPg = 0 Pa\nP f = 1/2\nPg = 2/3 Pb\nP f = 0 Pg = 1\nPc\nFor our example, the unit simplex is an equilateral triangle; the constraints are \u3008p, f \u3009\u2126 \u2265 P f and \u3008p,g\u3009\u2126 \u2265 Pg. On the side, we give the credal sets of the extreme coherent lower previsions we found.\nCredal sets represent lower previsions defined on the set of all gambles. This is why in our example, with a finite set K , we had P\u2126 = P{a,c}, even though the credal set of P{a,c} is the convex hull of Pa and Pc, a strict subset of MP\u2126 . It is prudent to associate coherent lower previsions with the largest credal set possible.4"}, {"heading": "2.3 REDUCTION THROUGH NORMALIZATION", "text": "A well-chosen normalization of the coefficients is an essential first step in the process towards a finitary coherence criterion. Starting from Definition 2, we normalize the coefficients by normalizing the constraints\u2019 right-hand side: Definition 3. A lower prevision P on K is coherent iff \u3008\u03bb ,P\u3009K \u2264 \u03b3 for all \u2022 constants \u03b3 in {\u22121,0,1}, \u2022 coefficient vectors \u03bb in RK\n\u2013 with at most one strictly negative component, \u2013 such that max\u3008\u03bb , id\u3009K = \u03b3 . C\nNow let us return for a moment to the toy example of the previous section. In this example, the constraints (1,\u22121) and (1,0) are made redundant by the constraints (0,\u22121) and (1,3/4). Put slightly differently, both are made redundant\n4This corresponds to using the so-called natural extension (Walley 1991, \u00a73.1), the least committal extension to all gambles.\nby (1,3/4), given (0,\u22121), i.e., Pg \u2265 ming = 0. The righthand side max\u3008\u03bb , id\u3009K is one for both (1,\u22121), (1,0), and (1,3/4), so the difference between them, the value of \u03bbg, only affects the constraints\u2019 left-hand side \u3008\u03bb ,P\u3009K . Exactly because Pg\u2265 0, we have that \u3008(1,\u22121),P\u3009K \u2264 \u3008(1,0),P\u3009K \u2264 \u3008(1,3/4),P\u3009K , which explains why (1,\u22121) and (1,0) are redundant. The same story can be told about (\u22121,1) and (0,1) versus (\u22121,0) and (2/3,1).\nWe learn from this that having a set of gambles that only take nonnegative values is useful for removing redundant constraints, by maximally increasing the values of their coefficients in such a way that the right-hand side maximum stays the same, given that we know that the lower prevision must, by coherence, be everywhere nonnegative. Restricting the set of gambles in such a way does not reduce the generality of our endeavor. We next show that we can apply an even more stringent restriction.\nTwo consequences of coherence are nonnegative homogeneity and constant-additivity (Walley 1991, \u00a72.6.1). Together, for a coherent lower prevision P on a set of gambles K , they imply the following: P(\u03bb \u00b7g+\u03b1) = \u03bb \u00b7Pg+\u03b1 must hold for all gambles g in K , all nonnegative real \u03bb and all real \u03b1 , whenever \u03bb \u00b7g+\u03b1 \u2208K .5 Equality constraints of this type express that the polytope of coherent lower previsions for a set of gambles in which some gamble pairs are related by such affine transformations is isomorphic to the one for a maximal subset for which this is not the case. So we can restrict our attention to sets of gambles which have a minimum of zero and a maximum of one: For sets of gambles that are not of this type, we can remove the constant gambles and for any other gamble g use g\u2212ming/maxg\u2212ming instead.\nTo modify Definition 3 to take into account what we have learned, we introduce the set of gambles\nL := { g \u2208 R\u2126 : ming = 0 and maxg = 1 } .\nDefinition 4. A lower prevision P on K , a finite subset of L , is coherent iff\n(i) P\u2265 0, (ii) \u3008\u03bb ,P\u3009K \u2264 \u03b3 for all\n\u2022 constants \u03b3 in {0,1}, \u2022 coefficient vectors \u03bb in RK\n\u2013 with at most one strictly negative component, \u2013 such that max\u3008\u03bb , id\u3009K = \u03b3 , \u2013 such that increasing any single component would\nincrease this maximum. C\nNote that the right-hand side maximum, and thus \u03b3 , cannot be negative. The reason is that all gambles considered are nonnegative and that the single gamble with a strictly negative coefficient\u2014if present\u2014has nonfull support, like any other gamble in K .\n5Put differently, \u03bb \u00b7Pg+\u03b1 is the unique coherent extension of P to \u03bb \u00b7g+\u03b1 (gamble-constant addition evaluated pointwise)."}, {"heading": "2.4 ADDING SINGLETON INDICATORS", "text": "While Definition 4 does provide a reduction in the number of constraints, we are still faced with an infinity of them. In our toy example, all convex combinations of (1,3/4) and (2/3,1) satisfy the definition\u2014they correspond to the constraints through Pb. Moreover, the last two restrictions on the coefficient vectors are bothersome to check in practice.\nWe are going to improve this impractical formulation here. If we add all singleton indicators to the set of gambles K , the requirement that increasing any one component of \u03bb must engender an increase of max\u3008\u03bb , id\u3009K , leads to a selection of coefficients that makes \u3008\u03bb , id\u3009K constant (cf. Walley 1991, \u00a7A2): Consider a vector of coefficients for which this is not the case; then we can modify it by increasing the coefficients of the singleton indicators until it is. This leads to: Definition 5. A lower prevision P on K , a finite subset of L that contains all singleton indicators, is coherent iff\n(i) P\u2265 0, (ii) \u3008\u03bb ,P\u3009K \u2264 \u03b3 for all\n\u2022 constants \u03b3 in {0,1}, \u2022 coefficient vectors \u03bb in RK\n\u2013 with at most one strictly negative component, \u2013 such that \u3008\u03bb , id\u3009K = \u03b3 .6 C\nSo now, to find the \u03bb that satisfy the given restrictions, we must find the solution set of the linear system \u3008\u03bb , id\u3009K = \u03b3 and retain those solutions \u03bb that have at most one negative component. However, it is still not practical to implement, and the resulting number of constraints is still infinite. So we need further modifications, to be applied in upcoming subsections. In the rest of this subsection, we show that we have not lost any generality by adding singleton indicators.\nTo see its effect, let us look how it impacts our toy example:7 We study the adjacency graph and the (P f ,Pg)-plane, to which orthogonal projections of Pa, Pb, and Pc are added.\nP f\nPg\n0 1\n0\n1 Pc\nPb\nPa\nP\u2126\nP{b,c}\nP{a,b}\nP2 P3\nP\u2126\nPabPbc\nPaPc\nPb\nP2P3\n6The gamble-constant equality is evaluated pointwise. 7The data for examples such as this (Output, toy) were gathered using our implementation of our finitary coherence criterion (Implementation) and publicly available polyhedral computation computer programs (e.g., Avis 2000; Fukuda & Prodon 1996).\nThe degenerate previsions are the only extreme coherent lower previsions that do not lie in the (P f ,Pg)-plane; each one of them is moreover connected to all other extreme coherent lower previsions (cf. graph). These observations about the degenerate previsions are general in character: Proposition 1. Of the extreme coherent lower previsions on a set of gambles K that includes the indicator I\u03c9 of some elementary event \u03c9 of \u2126 , the degenerate prevision P\u03c9 is the only one that is nonzero in I\u03c9 . C\nFour new extreme points have appeared: P2, P{a,b} = Pab,\nP2\nP3\nPab\nPbc P{b,c} = Pbc, and P3. The credal sets are given on the right.\nWhen orthogonally projecting the whole polytope onto the (P f ,Pg)-plane, the situation pictured in Subsection 2.2 results and these four points become redundant. In general, we can look at the coherent set of lower previsions on any set of gambles K as the projection on RK of the polytope for the set of all gambles. After projection, some vertices become redundant, but the projected polytope is the same as the one that would be obtained by constructing it directly.\nIt is possible to do the projection in terms of the linear constraints using Fourier\u2013Motzkin elimination (Ziegler 1995, Thm. 1.4). This algorithm is also implemented in publicly available polyhedral computation computer programs (e.g., Avis 2000; Fukuda & Prodon 1996). We now know that no generality is lost by adding the singleton indicators; it only result in an extra processing step.

For \u03b3 = 1, this system is inhomogeneous; for \u03b3 = 0, it is homogeneous.\nDue to solution unicity considerations, we transform the homogeneous systems to inhomogeneous ones: We bring the single gamble with a negative coefficient\u2014which by construction is always present in this case\u2014to the system\u2019s right-hand side and renormalize the coefficients.\n8This lemma is inspired by Walley (1991, \u00a7A1). 9Notation: (id\u2212P)N is the image of N under id\u2212P.\n10It is very similar to a criterion by Walley (1991, \u00a7A2). Alternatives using linear programming algorithms also exist (see, e.g., Walley et al. 2004, which also deals with contingent gambles).\nDefinition 8.

C\nNote that we have dropped the restriction to linearly independent (id\u2212P)N in (ii); it is of no more use to us there.\nHowever, the linear independence criterion in (iii) is of use: the following technical lemma allows it to be reformulated to not include reference to the lower prevision P anymore. Lemma 2 (Preservation of linear independence). Consider a set of gambles N , a coefficient vector \u03bb in RN such that \u3008\u03bb , id\u3009N = 1, and a lower prevision P on N . If the set (id\u2212P)N is linearly independent, then so is N . C\nThe restriction to linearly independent N can be applied to (ii) as well. The reason is the following: If \u3008\u03bb , id\u3009N = f , the nonnegative gamble f lies in the convex conical hull of the set of nonnegative gambles N . Carath\u00e9odory\u2019s theorem (Ziegler 1995, Thm. 1.15) then tells us that f lies in the convex conical hull of some linearly independent subset of N .11 Any solution for N will then be a convex combination of the solutions for the minimal such subsets. The corresponding constraint is the same convex combination of the constraints corresponding to these minimal subsets, and thus redundant.\nAt last we arrive at our final, finitary and practical definition: Definition 9. A lower prevision P on K , a finite subset of L that contains all singleton indicators, is coherent iff\n(i) P\u2265 0, (ii) \u3008\u03bb ,P\u3009N \u2264 P f for all\n\u2022 linearly independent subsets N of K such that 1 < |N | \u2264 |\u2126 |, \u2022 gambles f in K \\N such that supp f = suppN ,12 \u2022 coeff. vectors \u03bb in (R>0)N s.t. \u3008\u03bb , id\u3009N = f . (iii) \u3008\u03bb ,P\u3009N \u2264 1 for all \u2022 linearly independent subsets N of K such that\n1 < |N | \u2264 |\u2126 | and suppN = \u2126 .\n11Carath\u00e9odory\u2019s theorem can be illustrated by using a section of the cone and the rays corresponding to the gambles considered:\nf f f\nIn this example there are two three-dimensional and one twodimensional minimal subsets of linearly independent gambles.\n12Notation: suppN = \u22c3\ng\u2208N suppg and supp f is f \u2019s support.\n\u2022 coefficient vectors \u03bb in (R 6=0)N \u2013 with at most one strictly negative component, \u2013 such that \u3008\u03bb , id\u3009N = 1. C\nWe have made some cardinality and support restrictions explicit in this definition as well. The support restrictions follow from the restricted choice of coefficients and the gamble equation. The lower bound on the cardinality of the N comes from the fact those same equalities cannot be satisfied for |N |= 1, as f /\u2208N and I\u2126 /\u2208L . The upper bound is a consequence of the linear independence of the N .\nDefinition 9 allows us to obtain a characterization of the set of coherent lower previsions in terms of a finite number of constraints and\u2014via vertex enumeration\u2014extreme coherent lower previsions. It can also be used to efficiently check the coherence of a large number of lower previsions on the same set of gambles, as the constraints do not depend on the lower prevision to be checked.13"}, {"heading": "3 CONSTRAINTS & VERTICES ANALYZED", "text": "In this section, we present a number of cases\u2014sets of gambles K \u2014for which we use Definition 9 to generate a sufficient set of coherence constraints and calculate the corresponding extreme coherent lower previsions. In general, Definition 9 still generates redundant sets of constraints. Applying a redundancy removal algorithm is therefore advisable to speed up the Fourier\u2013Motzkin elimination and vertex enumeration steps.\nAs a warm-up exercise, and to illustrate some basic ideas, we first look at cases with few\u2014one, two, or three\u2014gambles (\u00a73.1). Then we increase the number of gambles and move the focus to combinatorial aspects (\u00a73.2 and \u00a73.3)."}, {"heading": "3.1 SMALL SETS OF GAMBLES", "text": "One gamble For completeness, we first consider the almost trivial case in which K consists of just one gamble,\nP\u2126\nP f = 0\nP f = 1 Pae.g., f := (1,1/2,0) on \u2126 := {a,b,c} (Output, 1on3). The one-dimensional nature of of this case inevitably leads to two irredundant constraints and two vertices. From how the credal sets of the example\u2014given on the right\u2014arise, we can deduce that in general the vertices are the vacuous prevision and a vacuous prevision relative to some event.\n13It is a mathematical generalization and historical descendant of the one for lower probabilities by Walley (1991, \u00a7A3).\nTwo gambles The toy example of Subsection 2.2 belongs to this class. We found four irredundant constraints and vertices. These numbers reappeared for the set of gambles K consisting of f := (1,1/2,0) and g := (0,1,1/2) on \u2126 := {a,b,c} (Output, 2on3) and also when increasing the size of the possibility space\u2014to four, five (Output, 2on4, 2on5). A general result for gambles \u2018in general position\u2019?\nAs a showcase, we here consider a situation in which both an upper and a lower prevision for a single gamble are specified. This is done by choosing an essentially negation invariant set of gambles, because of conjugacy: P f = \u2212P(\u2212 f ) = 1\u2212P(1\u2212 f ). So we choose the set K := { f ,1\u2212 f}, with the gamble f as above (Output, 1on3_lu). We find three\nPa\nP\u2126\nPc irredundant constraints and vertices.

There are seven irredundant constraints.

In this definition, this set is restricted to be a subset of a specific normed class and to contain singleton indicators. However, we have also shown that neither restriction is substantive: the first because extension to the whole class is an isomorphism, the second because Fourier\u2013Motzkin elimination can be applied. In this sense we have given a most general finitary characterization of the set of coherent lower previsions.\nFrom the combinatorial data we obtained, we see that the set of constraints generated by this criterion is still redundant, but that the irredundant sets can be relatively small. The less redundant, the more efficient and thus useful this type of criterion becomes for checking coherence. So working towards an irredundant criterion could be an interesting research path. The regularity found in the values-based gambles case provides hope that progress can be made here.\nIn this paper, we also showed how the criterion, together with vertex enumeration algorithms, can be used to compute extreme coherent lower previsions. Again, this is a most general procedure in the sense that we can in principle now calculate them for all finite sets of simple gambles and so obtain an alternative characterization of the corresponding set of coherent lower previsions. However, the computational burden\u2014both in calculation time and vertex storage\u2014seems prohibitive for real-life problems.\nApplications of extreme coherent lower previsions\u2014e.g., approximation\u2014would rely on our ability to decompose any coherent lower prevision into a convex combination of extreme ones. This decomposition itself is also computationally intensive, further depressing application hopes. Looking at things from the polytope theory side, this decomposition is based on the Minkowski sum of polytopes (Gr\u00fcnbaum 1967, Ch. 15). There is, however, also the Blaschke sum of polytopes, which provides a decomposition in terms of simplices (Alexandrov et al. 2005; Gr\u00fcnbaum 1967, Thm. 15.3.1). It could provide a more fruitful path.\nFor lower previsions that have to satisfy some additional property, e.g., permutation invariance, the extreme coherent lower previsions can be obtained by adding the necessary constraints to the H-representation. Furthermore, the ideas applied in this paper can be used to derive a similar finitary criterion for the more general conditional lower previsions, i.e., when contingent gambles are considered as well."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research is supported by a Francqui Fellowship of the Belgian American Educational Foundation.
