Each of the decision makers, hereafter referred to as agents, is selfish and seeks to implement his or her local optimal production plan to minimize his or her local costs. However, the agents could improve their situation by coordinating their individual production plans. The cost savings due to a better global production plan could be allocated to the agents in order to overcompensate them for deviating from their local optimal production plans. From a more general point of view, the problem of finding an appropriate allocation of cooperative gains is dealt with by cooperative game theory. The special situation of joint planning of selfish agents in case of private information considered here is the subject of collaborative operations planning (Dudek and Stadtler, 2005).\nThe state of the art in collaborative planning is discussed by Frayret (2009) and by Stadtler (2009). Overviews of automated negotiation approaches relevant to collaborative planning are given by Lomuscio et al. (2003) and Str\u00f6bel and Weinhardt (2003). Applications of collaborative planning to supply chains are discussed by Ertogral and Wu (2000), and Fink (2004, 2006), for example.\nThe proposed collaborative planning approach is applied to a distributed variant of the well-known multi level uncapacitated lot sizing problem (MLULSP) introduced by Yelle (1979). The distributed\n\u2217Corresponding author. Email: tobias.buer@uni-bremen.de\nMLULSP (DMLUSLSP) was presented by Homberger (2010) and assumes several local and selfish agents with private information instead of a single agent with full information. The DMLULSP covers some important features of real world problems. There are several final products, a multi level production structure, and a trade-off between inventory and setup costs. Coordination is difficult, because there are agents with private information and conflicting objectives. Finally, the problem is computationally challenging, as it is NP-hard for general product structures (Arkin et al., 1989). As to computational experiments, a variety of benchmark instances is available in the literature which allow for comparative test including other approaches.\nLot Sizing Problems are of high relevance in modern supply chains (Vo\u00dfand Woodruff, 2006). Surveys of the rich literature on lot sizing problems are given for example by Drexl and Kimms (1997), Jans and Degraeve (2007), or Winands et al. (2011). Integration of lot sizing with cooperative game theory is discussed by Drechsel and Kimms (2010, 2011). Metaheuristic solution approaches for the non-distributed MLULSP are amongst others presented by Dellaert and Jeunet (2000, 2003), Pitakaso et al. (2007), Homberger (2008), Xiao et al. (2011), and Xiao et al. (2012).\nThe literature discusses at least two distributed lot sizing variants. The one studied by Lee and Kumara (2007b,a) is based on auctions and has been tested on small size instances. For the other, the distributed MLULSP, several metaheuristic approaches that integrate concepts from group decision making are known in the literature: a simulated annealing approach (SA, Homberger, 2010), an approach based on an evolutionary strategy (ES, Homberger, 2011) and one based on ant colony optimization (ACO, Homberger and Gehring, 2010, 2011). These approaches differ by the used metaheuristic principle, the applied negotiation or voting mechanisms, and the relevant objective functions (minimizing total global cost or maximizing fairness). ES is especially useful for maximizing fairness. SA and ACO strive to minimize total global cost. In terms of solution quality, ACO outperforms SA on medium sized instances (40 and 50 items with 12 and 24 periods) but not on small or large instances (500 items, and 36 or 52 periods). Furthermore, ACO is significantly slower than SA on small, medium, and large instances.\nThe aim of this paper is to present a new collaborative ant colony metaheuristic (CACM) for solving the DMLULSP under global total cost minimization. Compared to Homberger and Gehring (2011) and the other mentioned approaches, the proposed CACM incorporates the following new conceptual and methodical ideas:\n1. Encoded solutions are represented by a new and simplified search graph. Let m denote the number of items to produce and let n denote the number of periods. The search graph proposed by Homberger and Gehring (2009) and used in Homberger and Gehring (2011) requires m(n+1) nodes and 12mn(n+ 1) directed edges while the new search graph uses 2mn+ 1 nodes but only 4mn \u2212 2 edges. The new search graph facilitates learning of pheromone values and therefore makes it easier to discover promising paths which lead to high quality solutions.\n2. Individual preferences of the agents \u2013 which are private \u2013 are aggregated by a voting mechanism and by a new collaborative local search procedure. Usually, to be able to reach a (near) optimal solution fast, an ant colony metaheuristic requires heuristic information on the problem, for example, the costs of the agents. However, this operational information is sensitive and therefore private. The new approach exploits this information indirectly, which enables to guide the search via heuristic information and, nevertheless, keeps operational information private.\n3. The new approach does without rank based voting mechanisms. This reduces computational effort and increases robustness, that is, there are less opportunities for undesired strategic behavior of the agents.\nAs it is shown below, the incorporation of these concepts has a high positive impact on the solution quality of the resulting approach.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the considered distributed multi-level lot sizing problem (DMLULSP) is characterized. Section 3 describes the developed collaborative ant colony\nmetaheuristic for solving the DMLULSP. Subject to Section 3 is the evaluation of the new approach by means of a computational study with 352 benchmark instances. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2 A distributed multi-level uncapacitated lot-sizing problem", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Classical centralized problem formulation", "text": "The distributed lot-sizing model studied in this paper extends the well-known multi-level uncapacitated lot sizing problem (MLULSP, cf. Yelle 1979, Steinberg and Napier 1980, Dellaert and Jeunet 2000). Therefore, the MLULSP is presented first using the notation given in Table 1. The MLULSP assumes a single decision maker who is aware of all information required for planning, especially, the setup costs and inventory holding costs per item and period. A formal description of the MLULSP is given by the formulas (1) to (8).\nmin fnd(y) = \u2211\ni\u2208I\n\u2211\nt\u2208T\n(si \u00b7 yit + hi \u00b7 lit) (1)\ns. t. lit = li,t\u22121 + xit \u2212 dit , \u2200i \u2208 I, \u2200t \u2208 T, (2)\nli,0 = 0 , \u2200i \u2208 I, (3)\nlit \u2265 0 , \u2200i \u2208 I, \u2200t \u2208 T \\ {0}, (4)\ndit = \u2211\nj\u2208\u0393+(i)\nrij \u00b7 xj,t+ti , \u2200i \u2208 {j \u2208 I | \u0393 +(j) 6= \u2205}, t \u2208 T, (5)\nxit \u2212M \u00b7 yit \u2264 0 , \u2200i \u2208 I, \u2200t \u2208 T, (6)\nxit \u2265 0 , \u2200i \u2208 I, \u2200t \u2208 T, (7)\nyit \u2208 {0, 1} , \u2200i \u2208 I, \u2200t \u2208 T. (8)\nThe goal of the MLULSP is to minimize the total costs fnd of a single, central decision maker. These are expressed by the objective function (1) which sums up the setup costs and the stockholding costs for all items i \u2208 I over all periods t \u2208 T . The inventory balance is guaranteed by (2). For all items, the inventory of the first period t = 0 is zero (3) and for remaining periods non-negative (4). For each period, the demands dit for the level zero items i \u2208 I with \u0393\n+(i) = \u2205 are given. The demands for the remaining items are determined by (5). These constraints ensure that the production of item j in period t+ ti triggers a corresponding demand dit for all i \u2208 \u0393\n\u2212(j), that is a demand for each item i that is preceding item j in the bill of materials. Without loss of generality, ri,j = 1 is assumed in (5). The lot size xit is non-negative (7). If xit > 0, that is, item i is produced in period t, then yit = 1, otherwise yit = 0. This is enforced by the constraints (6) and (8).\nArkin et al. (1989) have shown that the MLULSP is NP-hard for general multi-level product structures, i. e., for product structures, where each item can have multiple successors and predecessors like in Figure 1 (Salomon and Kuik, 1993). Figure 1 shows an example for a graphical representation of a product structure with m = 40 which follows the literature (Bookbinder and Koch, 1990). The production dependencies between items are indicated by arrows. Furthermore, items are classified by decreasing production level from top to bottom. Each end product i \u2208 I with \u0393+(i) = \u2205 is located at the highest level which is level 0. Each common part is located at the lowest level at which it is used anywhere in the product structure (Dellaert and Jeunet, 2000). The allocation of items to a group of agents also shown in Figure 1 is described next."}, {"heading": "2.2 Extension to a distributed group decision problem formulation", "text": "Following Homberger (2010), the MLULSP is now extended to a distributed group decision problem which is called distributed multi-level uncapacitated lot-sizing problem (DMLUSLSP). Instead of a single decision maker or agent who is responsible to produce all items I, the responsibility is jointly assigned to a group of agents A. Each agent a \u2208 A is responsible to produce the set of items Ia with \u22c3\na\u2208A Ia = I and \u22c2\na\u2208A Ia = \u2205. For instance, an agent might represent a profit center or an independent company and the agents might interact in a supply chain.\nAll agents are autonomous and self-interested. Therefore, the individual objective function fa of agent a \u2208 A is to minimize his or her total local costs for producing the items Ia, that is,\nmin fa(y) = \u2211\ni\u2208Ia\n\u2211\nt\u2208T\n(si \u00b7 yit + hi \u00b7 lit). (9)\nFurthermore, for all agents a \u2208 A and for all items i \u2208 Ia, the DMLULSP assumes asymmetric information regarding the cost parameters si and hi. These cost parameters are private information. That is, at the initiation of planning they are only known to agent a and during planning agent a does not want to reveal these to other agents. If this information would be common knowledge, price negotiations between agents might be negatively affected. On the other hand, symmetric information is assumed regarding the bill of materials. This assumption can be justified by some kind of common industry knowledge or joint development of products (e.g. collaborative engineering).\nThe DMLUSLSP consists of the constraints (2) to (8) and the objective function (10) which minimizes the total global costs\nmin f(y) = \u2211\na\u2208A\nfa. (10)\nIn comparable scenarios, the total global costs are also considered of interest by Fink (2004), Zimmer (2004), Jung et al. (2005), and Dudek and Stadtler (2005, 2007). In the following, the function (10) is simply referred to as total cost function or central cost function, the function (9) is also denoted as individual or local cost function of agent a \u2208 A. Usually, the minimization of the individual cost functions conflicts with the objective of minimizing the total costs. In order to resolve these conflicts and support the agents in agreeing on a joint production plan in order to produce all items I, the solution approach proposed in the following section uses collaborative local search and different voting mechanisms."}, {"heading": "3 A collaborative planning metaheuristic based on ant colony opti-", "text": "mization"}, {"heading": "3.1 Overview", "text": "A metaheuristic solution approach based on ant colony optimization (ACO) is presented that especially takes into account the distributed nature of the DMLULSP. The distributed solution approach is denoted as collaborative ant colony metaheuristic (CACM); an overview is given by Alg. 1. The metaheuristic CACM works on an encoded representation of a DMLULSP solution which is described in Sect. 3.2. Components of an encoded solution are represented by a search graph G which is traversed by artificial ants in order to construct encoded solutions. Sect. 3.3 introduces the search graph G and Sect. 3.4 presents the stochastic ant construction procedure. Each constructed solution is improved by a collaborative local search heuristic (cf. Sect. 3.5). Both, the used graph structure and the local search heuristic incorporate new concepts compared to the ant metaheuristic of Homberger and Gehring (2011). After a set B of encoded solutions has been constructed, the agents negotiate about the acceptance of a solution in B by casting votes according to one of several voting rules described in Sect. 3.6. Finally, the pheromone information related to the arcs of the search graph are updated according to the present accepted solution e\u2217 (Sect. 3.7). That is, in the next iteration of CACM ants use a different probability distribution in order to construct a new encoded solution.\nCACM requires several input parameters. The problem data include the number of items m \u2208 N, the number of periods n \u2208 N, and the set A of agents. The termination of CACM is controlled by the number of generated solutions s \u2208 N. The ballot size b \u2208 N, b \u21d4 |B|, specifies the number of solutions which can be negotiated by the agents A in a single election.

CACM is executed by a neutral mediator. In order to construct encoded solutions, the mediator has to be aware of the items I to produce and of the possible production periods T . The agents do not have to reveal private information like costs or free production capacities, neither to the mediator nor to other agents. To control the search process in order to find a jointly accepted solution e\u2217, the mediator has to interact with the agents in both steps marked as distributed in Alg. 1. CACM outputs a jointly accepted solution e\u2217."}, {"heading": "3.2 Representation of a solution", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Solution encoding", "text": "For the MLULSP, the decision variables xit represent the lot size of item i produced in period t. The binary decision variables yit represent the setup decisions which indicate wether item i is produced in period t at all. Because of the structure of the MLULSP, it is possible to determine the optimal lot sizes xit, if the optimal setup decisions yit are known (Dellaert and Jeunet, 2000).\nTherefore, the proposed CACM focuses its search effort to approximate the set of optimal setup decisions. However, CACM does not operate on the yit directly, but indirectly on an encoded representation of the setup decisions. For each binary setup decision variable yit, there is an encoded binary setup decision variable eit following the suggestion of Homberger (2008). Both variables are related as follows:\n(eit = 0) \u21d4 (yit = 0), (11)\n(eit = 1) \u21d2 (yit = 0 \u2228 yit = 1). (12)\nAccordingly, the variables eit = 1 indicate a possible, but not mandatory, production of item i \u2208 I in period t \u2208 T .

Whether a possible production takes place if eit = 1, can be deduced by the following decoding rule."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Solution decoding", "text": "An encoded solution e \u2208 {0, 1}m\u00d7n is transformed to a DMLULSP solution in a two steps procedure. The product level of an item i determines the order in which demand dit, lot size xit, and inventory lit are calculated. The procedures starts with the lowest level items (final products) and advances with items of increasing product level. That is, the demands for the final products (level 0) are determined first, the demands for level 1 items are calculated next, and so on (cf. Homberger (2008))\nHence, the items are considered in the sequence of their non-decreasing product level. If item i is a final product (level 1), then dit is given for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 T .

A solution is represented by the path chosen by the ant. In order to enable such an artificial ant to construct an encoded solution for the DMLULSP, a directed graph G = (V,E) with a set V of nodes and a set E of directed edges is used (see Figure 2). The node set V consists of three disjunct subsets, i. e., V = {v}\u222aV 1\u222aV 0. The starting point of an ant is the initial node v. For each of the two possible values of an encoded decision variable eij there exists a node. The encoded decision to produce item i in period j (eij = 1) is represented by node v1ij \u2208 V 1. The encoded decision eij = 0 is represented by node v 0 ij \u2208 V 0. Therefore, V 1 \u2229 V 0 = \u2205 and |V 1| = |V 0|. The nodes in V 1 are called black nodes, the nodes in V 0 are called white nodes. The set of directed edges E is defined as follows. The initial node v is associated with two directed edges (v, v11,1) and (v, v 0 1,1). Furthermore, each node v \u2208 V \\ {v 1 m,n, v 0 m,n} acts as the origin of exactly two directed edges. From a black node two edges originate, one points to another black node and one points to a white node; analogously, from a white node one edge points to a black node and one edge points to another white node. More precisely, let a, b \u2208 {0, 1}, a 6= b and va \u2208 V a, vb \u2208 V b. The pair of edges originating from vaij is defined as (v a ij , v a i,j+1) and (v a ij , v b i,j+1), provided that j < n.

Both voting rules are applied using ballot sizes b of 1, 10, 20, and 100. The results are given in Table 4.\nThe configuration of Borda voting and Rawls voting with a ballot size of b = 1 results in equivalent voting procedures and, therefore, leads to identical results (see Table 4). Especially in case of scenarios with five agents, the results for the Borda voting rule are slightly better than the results for the Rawls voting rule. However, in the five agents scenario, both voting rules lead to the best results for ballot sizes of only one. For the two agent scenario, ballot sizes of one lead to the second best results. All in all, both voting rules seem to result in higher total costs compared to the degenerated case (b = 1). Therefore, the parameter ballot size b is set to one, that is, the function \u2019voting(B,A)\u2019 in Alg. 1 is in fact deactivated. The only voting mechanism applied is complete approval voting which is used during collaborative local search. A positive side effect of doing without Rawls and Borda voting is that no local cost information have to be revealed (Rawls) and the opportunity of strategic bidding, which is intrinsic in ranked based voting, is reduced (Borda)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Effect of collaborative local search", "text": "In this test, the effect of CLS is studied. The CACM approach including collaborative local search (CLS, cf. Sect. 3.5) is compared with CACM excluding CLS. The latter is denoted as CACMex.

The initial encoded solution e is set to the unit matrix.\nThe three variants are compared by means of the instances from groups s1, s2, and s5. The instances of s1 correspond to the non-distributed MLULSP for which optimal solutions are known. Consequently, Table 5 depicts the average gap G with respect to the optimal MLULSP solution.\nCACM solves 80 of 96 instances to optimality. For the remaining 16 instances, the average optimality gap is only 0.07 percent although CACM does not use heuristic information specific to the MLULSP to control the search process. Furthermore, CACM outperforms the stand-alone CLS and CACMex both in the non-distributed (s1) and distributed (s2, s5) scenario. Obviously, the combination of CLS and CACMex increases the overall performance. Finally, Figure 3 shows exemplarily for an instance, that the heuristic CACM converges faster than the heuristic CACMex."}, {"heading": "4.4 Comparison with heuristics from the literature", "text": "CACM is compared to three approaches designed for the DMLUSLP denoted here as SA, ES, and ACO which are based on the metaheuristics simulated annealing, evolutionary strategy, and ant colony optimization, respectively. SA was introduced by (Homberger, 2010), ES is presented in Homberger (2011), and ACO is discussed in (Homberger and Gehring, 2010, 2011). Some of these previous computational experiments were repeated or broadened to take into account additional instances (see Section 4.1.4).\nTable 6 shows the average gap G over 176 instances with two agents (classes s2,m2,l2) as well as over 176 instances with five agents (classes s5, m5, l5). The detailed results for medium and large instances are given in Tables 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the appendix. Due to long runtimes Homberger and Gehring (2010, 2011) compared their approach only by means of the medium sized instances of groups m2 and m5.\nThe presented CACM approach significantly improves the best known solutions for the medium and large instances (see Table 6). For example, CACM reduces the average gap G of the large instances with five agents (group l5) from 46 percent to only about 5 percent. In detail, CACM improves twentynine out of forty m2 instances, twenty out of forty m5 instances, thirty-six out of forty l2 instances, and forty out of forty l5 instances (see appendix, Tables 7, 8, 9, and 10). With respect to the classes of small instances s2 and s5, CACM is the second best procedure."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "A collaborative solution approach based on the metaheuristic ant colony optimization was presented. It is used to coordinate joint production planning of a coalition of self-interested decision makers with asymmetric information. The search process is executed by a mediator who is not aware of the agents local costs. Furthermore, the agents do not have to reveal private cost information during search. Nevertheless, to control the search process, the mediator tries to elicit preferences by means of voting and a new collaborative local search procedure. The results are used to update the pheromone information which guide the solution construction process. Solutions are constructed by means of a new graph structure based on encoded solutions which is less complicated and therefore easier to search. The new approach CACM is evaluated by means of 356 benchmark instances from the literature and outperforms all existing distributed planning approaches on the sets of medium and large instances.\nFor future research, it appears interesting to study collaborative lot sizing problems with a nondisjunct assignment of items to agents. This would increase potential planning conflicts between the agents and opens up interesting challenges for developing collaborative planning metaheuristics."}], "references": [{"title": "Computational complexity of uncapacitated multi-echelon", "author": ["E.

Lot Sizing Problems are of high relevance in modern supply chains (Vo\u00dfand Woodruff, 2006). Surveys of the rich literature on lot sizing problems are given for example by Drexl and Kimms (1997), Jans and Degraeve (2007), or Winands et al. (2011). Integration of lot sizing with cooperative game theory is discussed by Drechsel and Kimms (2010, 2011).

(2011), and Xiao et al. (2012). The literature discusses at least two distributed lot sizing variants. The one studied by Lee and Kumara (2007b,a) is based on auctions and has been tested on small size instances. For the other, the distributed MLULSP, several metaheuristic approaches that integrate concepts from group decision making are known in the literature: a simulated annealing approach (SA, Homberger, 2010), an approach based on an evolutionary strategy (ES, Homberger, 2011) and one based on ant colony optimization (ACO, Homberger and Gehring, 2010, 2011). These approaches differ by the used metaheuristic principle, the applied negotiation or voting mechanisms, and the relevant objective functions (minimizing total global cost or maximizing fairness). ES is especially useful for maximizing fairness. SA and ACO strive to minimize total global cost. In terms of solution quality, ACO outperforms SA on medium sized instances (40 and 50 items with 12 and 24 periods) but not on small or large instances (500 items, and 36 or 52 periods). Furthermore, ACO is significantly slower than SA on small, medium, and large instances. The aim of this paper is to present a new collaborative ant colony metaheuristic (CACM) for solving the DMLULSP under global total cost minimization.
