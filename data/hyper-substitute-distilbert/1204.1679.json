INTRODUCTION\nClassification is a basic task in data mining and pattern recognition that requires the construction of a classifier, that is, a function that assigns a class label to instances described by a set of features (or attributes) [15]. Learning accurate classifiers from pre-classified data has been a very active research topic in the machine learning. In recent years, numerous approaches have been proposed in face recognition for classification such as Fuzzy sets, Rough sets, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and Genetic Algorithms, Ant Behavior Simulation, Case-based Reasoning, Bayesian Networks etc. Much of the related work on image classification for indexing, classifying and retrieval has focused on the definition of low-level descriptors and the generation of metrics in the descriptor\nspace [2]. These descriptors are extremely useful in some generic image classification tasks or when classification based on query by example. However, if the aim is to classify the image using the descriptors of the object content this image.\nSeveral methods have been proposed for face recognition and classification, we quote: structural methods and global techniques. Structural techniques deal with local or analytical characteristics. It is to extract the geometric and structural features that constitute the local structure of face of image. Thus, analysis of the human face is achieved by the individual description of its different parts (eyes, nose, mouth, ..) and by measuring the relative positions of one by another. The class of global methods includes methods that enhance the overall properties of the face. Among the most important approaches, we quote Correlation Technique used by Alexandre [Lemieux 03] is based on a simple comparison between a test image and face learning, Principal component analysis approach (eigenfaces) based on principal component analysis (PCA) [52-53], discrete cosine transform technique (DCT) which based on computing the discrete cosine transform [58], Technique using Neural Networks and support vector machine (SVM) In [45].\nThere are two questions to be answered in order to solve difficulties that are hampering the progress of research in this direction. Firstly, how to link semantically objects in images with high-level features? That\u2019s mean how to learn the dependence between objects that reflected better the data? Secondly, how to classify the image using the structure of dependence finding? Our paper presents a work which uses three variants of na\u00efve Bayesian Networks to classify image of faces using the structure of dependence finding between objects. This paper is divided as follows: Section 2, presents an overview of distance tangent; Section 3 describes the developed approach based in Na\u00efve Bayesian Network, we describe how the feature space is extracted; and we introduce the method of building the Na\u00efve Bayesian network, Global Tree Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes (GTAN), Global Forest Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes (GFAN), Tree Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes (TAN) and Forest Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes (FAN)and inferring posterior probabilities out of the\nnetwork; Section 4 presents some experiments; finally, Section 5 presents the discussion and conclusions.\nII. TANGENT DISTANCE\nThe tangent distance is a mathematical tool that can compare two images taking into account small transformations (rotations, translations, etc.).. Introduced in the early 90s by Simard [60] it was combined with different classifiers for character recognition, detection and recognition of faces and recognition of speech. It is still not widely used. The distance of an image to another image I1 I2 is calculated by measuring the distance between the parameter spaces via I1 and I2 respectively. These spaces locally model all forms generated by the possible transformations between two images. When an image is transformed (e.g. scaled and rotated) by a transformation which depends on L parameters (e.g. the scaling factor and rotation angle), the set of all transformed patterns\n(1)\nis a manifold of at most dimension L in pattern space. The distance between two patterns can now be defined as the minimum distance between their respective manifolds, being truly invariant with respect to the L regarded transformations. Unfortunately, computation of this distance is a hard nonlinear optimization problem and the manifolds concerned generally do not have an analytic expression. Therefore, small transformations of the pattern xare approximated by a tangent\nsubspace to the manifold at the point x. This subspace is obtained by adding to x a linear combination of the vectors that span the tangent subspace and are the partial derivatives of with respect to . We obtain a first-order approximation of\nThe single-sided (SS) TD is defined as :\nThe tangent vectors can be computed using finite differences between the original image xand a reasonably small transformation of x. Example images that were computed using 3 are shown in Figure 1(with the original image on the left).\n.\nIII. BAYESIAN NETWORK"}, {"heading": "A. Definition", "text": "Bayesian networks represent a set of variables in the form of nodes on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It maps the conditional independencies of these variables. Bayesian networks bring us four advantages as a data modeling tool [20- 22-24]. Firstly, Bayesian networks are able to handle incomplete or noisy data which is very frequently in image analysis. Secondly, Bayesian networks are able to ascertain causal relationships through conditional independencies, allowing the modeling of relationships between variables. The last advantage is that Bayesian networks are able to incorporate existing knowledge, or pre-known data into its learning, allowing more accurate results by using what we already know.

Indeed, naive Bayes has been found to work poorly for regression problems (Frank et al., 2000), and produces poor probability estimates (Bennett, 2000).

We recall the architecture developed in our article [5] and the new architecture developed in this work. In the latter, we proposed a Bayesian network for each class. So we all structures as classes in the training set. Each structure models the dependencies between different objects in the face image. The proposed system comprises three main modules: a module for extracting primitive blocks from the local cutting of facial images, a classification module of primitives in the cluster by using the method of k-means, and a classification module the overall picture based on the structures of Bayesian networks developed for each class. The developed system for faces classification is shown in the following figure:\nEmphasize at this level we will adopt two types of Bayesian networks. On the one hand, a global network (figure 5) for all classes and other one network for every class.\nThis sub-section describes the different step of the proposed system:"}, {"heading": "A.

These characteristics are very used in the synthesis of texture. The average gives the average value (or moderate) levels of gray from all the pixels in the region of interest (ROI). This parameter represents the location of the histogram on the scale of grays. The images that have a higher average appear brighter. The standard\ndeviation expresses the clustering (or dispersion) around the mean value. Values are more scattered, the greater the standard deviation is large. Most values are clustered around the mean, minus the standard deviation is high. Energy is a parameter that measures the homogeneity of the image. The energy has a value far lower than a few homogeneous areas. In this case, there are a lot of gray level transitions. Homogeneity is a parameter that has a behavior opposite contrast.

Discussion", "text": "According to our experiments, we observe that the naive Bayesian network gave a good result as NAT. Two factors may cause:\n The directions of links are crucial in a NAT. According to the TAN algorithm detailed in our article [5] an\nattribute is randomly selected as the root of the tree and the directions of all links are made thereafter. We note that the selection of the root attribute actually determines the structure of the TAN result, since TAN is a directed graph. Thus the selection of the root attribute is important to build a NAT.\n Of unnecessary links can exist in a NAT. According to the TAN algorithm, a spanning tree of maximum weight\nis constructed. Thus, the number of links is set to n-1. Sometimes it could be a possible bad fit of the data, since some links may be unnecessary to exist in the NAT.\nIt is observed that NB and Global Fan gave the same classification rate, since they have the same structure. We note also that the rate of correct classification given by FAN is very high that TAN. Several factors are involved:\n1- According to the FAN algorithm illustrated in our article [5], the choice of the attribute A root is defined by the\nequation below, the maximum mutual root has the information with the class.,\n.

CONCLUSION\nThis study is an extension of our previous work [5]. We have developed a new approach for classifying image of faces using distance tangent and the method of k-means to cluster the vectors descriptors of the images. First, we use the technique of tangent distance to calculate several tangent\nspaces representing the same image. The objective is to reduce the error in the research phase. Then we have used Bayesian network as classifier to classify the whole image into five classes. We have implemented and compared three classifiers: NB TAN and FAN using two types of structure, a global structure and structure per class presenting respectively the dependence between the attributes inter and intra-class. The goal was to compare the results obtained by these structures and apply algorithms that can produce useful information from a high dimensional data. In particular, the aim is to improve Na\u00efve Bayes by removing some of the unwarranted independence relations among features and hence we extend Na\u00efve Bayes structure by implementing the Tree Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes. Unfortunately, our experiments show that TAN performs even worse than Na\u00efve Bayes in classification. Responding to this problem, we have modified the traditional TAN learning algorithm by implementing a novel learning algorithm, called Forest Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes. We experimentally test our algorithm in data image of faces and compared it to NB and TAN. The experimental results show that FAN improves significantly NB classifiers\u2019 performance in classification. In addition, the results show that the mean of classification accuracy is better when the number of cluster is optimal that\u2019s mean the number of cluster that can reflected better the data. Then, we marked that the structure of FAN per class performs better than Global FAN. This results is explained by the use of structure of FAN per class reflect better the dependence of the attribute intra-class (in the same class), and the use of a global structure reflects better the dependence inter-class (between the classes)."}], "references": [{"title": "On certain integrals of Lipschitz-Hankel type involving products of Bessel functions,", "author": ["G.

In this paper, we propose to use new approach combining distance tangent, k-means algorithm and Bayesian network for image classification. First, we use the technique of tangent distance to calculate several tangent spaces representing the same image. The objective is to reduce the error in the classification phase. Second, we cut the image in a whole of blocks. For each block, we compute a vector of descriptors. Then, we use K-means to cluster the low-level features including color and texture information to build a vector of labels for each image. Finally, we apply five variants of Bayesian networks classifiers (Na\u00efve Bayes, Global Tree Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes (GTAN), Global Forest Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes (GFAN), Tree Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes for each class (TAN), and Forest Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes for each class (FAN) to classify the image of faces using the vector of labels. In order to validate the feasibility and effectively, we compare the results of GFAN to FAN and to the others classifiers (NB, GTAN, TAN). The results demonstrate FAN outperforms than GFAN, NB, GTAN and TAN in the overall classification accuracy.
