INTRODUCTION", "text": "Text categorization [1] [2] is an upcoming and vital field in today\u2019s world which is most importantly required and demanded to efficiently categorize various text documents into different categories. Artificial Intelligence [3] \u2013 [5] provides many learning methods and paradigms to represent, interpret and acquire domain knowledge to help other documents in learning. Such categorization must produce the accurate and correct results with high performance. Due to the huge data size and complexity, data dimensionality reduction has also been a primary concern. Great levels of efforts have been put in this direction, so that the major problem of curse of dimensionality can be reduced.\nText documents clusterization [1] [2] [6] has been paid good attention. Many models and techniques have been developed for clustering. The clustering techniques can be applied to the web documents also. In this way, they can be categorized into their major and respective categories of business, stock, sports, cricket, movie, news and many more. Therefore, the unsupervised learning paradigm [6] is used to make the document clusters. It does not include any prior information and knowledge, that\u2019 why it requires complex text processing techniques.\nNowadays, text classification [7] \u2013 [16] [19] - [28] is gaining more attention and focus for text categorization activities [17] [18] even at the overhead of increased cost. Research is also being done for the fuzzy association, signature, c-means, algorithms and methods for categorization tasks. Text classification with fuzzy logic base provides a better forum to sufficiently categorize\nthe text and web documents. It also results in justified solutions with reduced efforts. When it is combined with the feature clustering technique, it highly improves the representation of features. It further improves the storage performance and decreases the risks of feature ambiguity. Therefore, text classification techniques provide prior information and classification knowledge, so that classifiers can be made learnable to further categorize text and web documents. Many researchers are doing well in this area. Some of the applications in this field are, text classification system SECTCS (Smart English and Chinese Text Classification System) [8], segmenting handwritten text [9], nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques [10] [11], complex linguistic features in context - sensitive text classification techniques [7] [12], cyber terrorism investigation [13], spam filtering [14] [15], topic spotting, email routing, language guessing, and many more. Text Classification and clustering are two opposite extremes with regard to the extent of human supervision they require. Real-life applications are considered somewhere in between, because unlabeled data is easy to collect but labelling data is more helpful.\nAs these techniques pay the attention on the accurate and correct categorization; they focus on the text pre-processing and document similarity analysis as well. During text pre-processing, the set of words are extracted to find out the concepts as features or words by using Verb-Argument Structures [6] or Pseudo Thesaurus [20]. In some research areas, bag-of-words [25] is found from the text documents. This word set is a huge collection of words that needs to be reduced further by using feature clustering [25] [28] methods. The resultant small collection of words is analyzed for the document similarity [16] [22] - [28]. If some of the documents are found similar, they are categorized into one. Many fuzzy similarity based models and algorithms have been introduced with the very nature of its membership functions [22] \u2013 [28], fuzzy association [24] [28], fuzzy C-means, production rules [19] [27]. Text classification using fuzzy based similarity is an essential task in today\u2019s categorization forum and typically, getting a great attention in various related application fields and areas. Nowadays, such concerns have been the part of many applications and related studies. Some of the applications are related to the learning evaluation [28] and education learning styles [19].\nSection 2 discusses the key points and related aspects of theoretical background of fuzzy similarity based models and techniques. Section 3 discusses a technical comparative study on different fuzzy similarity based models. It discusses and shows various methods and their methodologies in detail. In section 4, an analytical discussion on the experimental results is given. Various results and their important concerns are discussed and shown with respect to different parameters. Finally, section 5 concludes the paper."}, {"heading": "2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND", "text": "Over the last decades, fuzzy similarity based text document classification has got attention very much and considered as an important research area. Different techniques, models and ways are searched to design a best categorization system. Such field is not only used in the small level organizations, industries and corporate, but also covers a vast community all around the world. The new techniques, their collaboration and research always open a new paradigm towards the advancements.\nCurrent research studies show that fuzzy logic and its area of concerns provide efficient base for text categorization, dimensionality reduction, feature selection and extraction, and similarity analyzer related issues. Fuzzy logic is considered as a branch of logic especially designed for representing knowledge and human reasoning in such a way that it is amenable to processing by a computer [3]. The major concepts of fuzzy logic are fuzzy sets, linguistic variable, possibility distributions, and fuzzy if \u2013 then rules. Fuzziness or Degree of Uncertainty pertains to the uncertainty associated with a system, i.e., the fact that nothing can be predicted with exact\nprecision. Practically, the values of variables are not always precise; rather approximate values are more likely to be known. The vagueness can adequately be handled using fuzzy set theory. This theory provides a strict mathematical framework using which vague conceptual phenomena can be studied rigorously. It is also called the property of language [3] \u2013 [5]. Its main source is the imprecision involved in defining and using symbols. It is a property of models, computational procedures, and languages. Hence, a fuzzy set is a collection of distinct elements with a varying degree of relevance or inclusion."}, {"heading": "2.1. Feature Clustering", "text": "The concept of feature clustering [10] [11] [22] \u2013 [24] enhances the provision of text dimension criticality solution. It is an efficient way to compress the collected feature sets more, so that the resultant data can be handled and used properly without any loss. These clusters are represented either by the term of maximum frequency in a group (or cluster) [22] [24] or can be found by self constructing feature clustering algorithm [23]. Feature clustering is also done with the use of the pseudo-thesaurus by identifying each term [6] as noun, pronoun, adverb, adjective, delimiters etc. Researchers have shown that it helps to reduce the high dimensional data into smaller one adequately."}, {"heading": "2.2. Fuzzy Association", "text": "Fuzzy sets pay an important and vital role in text categorization. They are widely recognized as many real world relations are intrinsically fuzzy. Fuzzy association [24] [28] is used to discover important associations between different sets of attribute values. A fuzzy association rule A\nC is very strong if both A C and C A are strong."}, {"heading": "2.3. Fuzzy Production Rules", "text": "The novel method of rule-base construction and a rule weighting mechanism [19] [27] can result in a rule-base containing rules of different lengths, which is much more useful when dealing with high dimensional data sets."}, {"heading": "2.4. Fuzzy Clustering and C-Means", "text": "In fuzzy clustering [28], each point has a degree of belonging to clusters, as in fuzzy logic, rather than belonging completely to one cluster. Thus, points on the edge of a cluster may be in the cluster to a lesser degree than points in the centre of cluster."}, {"heading": "2.5. Fuzzy Signatures", "text": "Fuzzy signatures [26] are used in those applications and key areas which require the handling of complex structured data and interdependent feature problems. They can also used in special concerns where data is missing. So, this depicts many areas where objects with very complex and sometimes interdependent features are to be classified along with the evaluation of similarities and dissimilarities. This leads a complex decision model hard to construct effectively. Due to the very nature of fuzzy signatures of flexibility, it can be used for many text mining tasks, with the benefit of the hierarchical structuring; therefore, the text document classification models can be constructed [26]."}, {"heading": "3.

A Tour on Different Methodologies and Procedures", "text": "Various methodologies and procedures are depicted in table 2. These methodologies are shown in steps. [22], [23], [24], and [25] show that text documents or web documents are considered for text classification which use a predefined set of classes initially in the training phase. In [22], [23] and [24], the text is pre-processed and cleaned to extract all important features. In [25], a bag of words is used and processed to get the word patterns. Next, the fuzzy similarity techniques are applied as shown in table 1. Finally, text is classified using the classifier. Different methods have implemented different procedures to categorize the text.\nThe use of fuzzy signature for the text classification of the non-segmented text [26] shows that how the non-segmentable text can be segmented and classified. In [27], a rule based weighting technique is used to efficiently perform the data mining tasks. The learning evaluation using the extended fuzzy ontology model [28] is provided for learning techniques based classification.
