Below, we only consider constant domains, i.e., every possible world has the same domain.\nLet I V be a set of first-order (individual) variables, PV a set of propositional variables, and S Y M a set of predicate symbols of any arity. Formulas of quantified conditional logic are given by the following grammar (where X i \u2208 I V ,P \u2208 PV ,k \u2208 S Y M ):\n\u03d5 ,\u03c8 ::= P | k(X1, . . . ,Xn) | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2228\u03c8 | \u2200X .\u03d5 | \u2200P.\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u21d2 \u03c8\nFrom the selected set of primitive connectives, other logical connectives can be introduced as abbreviations: for example, \u03d5 \u2227\u03c8 , \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 (material implication), and \u2203X .\u03d5 abbreviate \u00ac(\u00ac\u03d5 \u2228\u00ac\u03c8), \u00ac\u03d5 \u2228\u03c8 and \u00ac\u2200X .\u00ac\u03d5 etc. Syntactically, quantified conditional logics can be seen as a generalization of quantified multimodal logic where the index of modality \u21d2 is a formula of the same language. For instance, in (\u03d5 \u21d2 \u03c8)\u21d2 \u03b4 the subformula \u03d5 \u21d2 \u03c8 is the index of the second occurrence of \u21d2.\nRegarding semantics, many different formalizations have been proposed (see [8]), here we focus on the selection function semantics [6], which is based on possible world structures and has been successfully used in [9] to develop proof methods for some conditional logics. We adapt selection function semantics for quantified conditional logics.\nAn interpretation is a structure M = \u3008S, f ,D,Q, I\u3009 where, S is a set of possible items called worlds, f : S\u00d72S 7\u2192 2S is the selection function, D is a non-empty set of individuals (the first-order domain), Q is a non-empty collection of subsets of W (the propositional domain), and I is a classical interpretation function where for each n-ary predicate symbol k, I(k,w)\u2286 Dn.\n\u2217This work has been presented at the conference on Non-classical Modal and Predicate Logics 2011, Guangzhou (Canton), China, 5-9 December 2011.\nA variable assignment g = (giv,gpv) is a pair of maps where, giv : I V 7\u2192 D maps each individual variable in I V to an object in D, and gpv : maps each propositional variable in PV to a set of worlds in Q.\nSatisfiability of a formula \u03d5 for an interpretation M = \u3008S, f ,D,Q, I\u3009, a world s \u2208 S, and a variable assignment g = (giv,gpv) is denoted as M,g,s |= \u03d5 and defined as follows, where [a/Z]g denote the assignment identical to g except that ([a/Z]g)(Z) = a:\nM,g,s |= k(X1, . . . ,Xn) if and only if \u3008giv(X1), . . . ,giv(Xn)\u3009 \u2208 I(k,w) M,g,s |= P if and only if s \u2208 gpv(P) M,g,s |= \u00ac\u03d5 if and only if M,g,s 6|= \u03d5 (that is, not M,g,s |= \u03d5 ) M,g,s |= \u03d5 \u2228\u03c8 if and only if M,g,s |= \u03d5 or M,g,s |= \u03c8 M,g,s |= \u2200X .\u03d5 if and only if M,([d/X ]giv,gpv),s |= \u03d5 for all d \u2208 D M,g,s |= \u2200P.\u03d5 if and only if M,(giv, [p/P]gpv),s |= \u03d5 for all p \u2208 Q M,g,s |= \u03d5 \u21d2 \u03c8 if and only if M,g, t |= \u03c8 for all t \u2208 S such that t \u2208 f (s, [\u03d5 ]) where [\u03d5 ] = {u | M,g,u |= \u03d5} An interpretation M = \u3008S, f ,D,Q, I\u3009 is a model if for every variable assignment g and every formula \u03d5 , the set of worlds {s \u2208 S | M,g,s |= \u03d5} is a member of Q. As usual, a conditional formula \u03d5 is valid in a model M = \u3008S, f ,D,Q, I\u3009, denoted with M |= \u03d5 , if and only if for all worlds s \u2208 S and variable assignments g holds M ,g,s |= \u03d5 . A formula \u03d5 is a valid, denoted |= \u03d5 , if and only if it is valid in every model.\nf is defined to take [\u03d5 ] (called the proof set of \u03d5 w.r.t. a given model M ) instead of \u03d5 . This approach has the consequence of forcing the so-called normality property: given a model M , if \u03d5 and \u03d5 \u2032 are equivalent (i.e., they are satisfied in the same set of worlds), then they index the same formulas w.r.t. to the \u21d2 modality.

The set T of simple types in HOL is usually freely generated from a set of basic types {o, i} using the function type constructor . Here we instead consider a set of basic type {o, i,u}, where o denotes the type of Booleans, and where i and u denote some non-empty domains. Without loss of generality, we will later identify i with a set of worlds and u with a domain of individuals.\nLet \u03b1 ,\u03b2 ,o \u2208 T . The terms of HOL are defined by the grammar (p\u03b1 denotes typed constants and X\u03b1 typed variables distinct from p\u03b1 ):\ns, t ::= p\u03b1 | X\u03b1 | (\u03bbX\u03b1 .s\u03b2 )\u03b1 \u03b2 | (s\u03b1 \u03b2 )\u03b2 | (\u00aco o so)o | (so \u2228o o o to)o | (\u03a0(\u03b1 o) o s\u03b1 o)o\nComplex typed terms are constructed via abstraction and application. The primitive logical connectives are \u00aco o,\u2228o o o and \u03a0(\u03b1 o) o (for each type \u03b1). From these, other logical connectives can\nbe introduced as abbreviations: for example, \u2227 and \u2192 abbreviate the terms \u03bbA.\u03bbB.\u00ac(\u00acA\u2228\u00acB) and \u03bbA.\u03bbB.\u00acA\u2228B, etc. HOL terms of type o are called formulas. Binder notation \u2200X\u03b1 .so is used as an abbreviation for (\u03a0(\u03b1 o) o (\u03bbX\u03b1 .so)). Substitution of a term A\u03b1 for a variable X\u03b1 in a term B\u03b2 is denoted by [A/X ]B, where it is assumed that the bound variables of B avoid variable capture. Well known operations and relations on HOL terms include \u03b2\u03b7-normalization and \u03b2\u03b7-equality, denoted by s =\u03b2\u03b7 t.\nThe following definition of HOL semantics closely follows the standard literature [1, 2]. A frame is a collection {D\u03b1}\u03b1\u2208T of nonempty sets called domains such that Do = {T,F} where T represents truth and F falsehood, Di 6= /0 and Du 6= /0 are chosen arbitrary, and D\u03b1 \u03b2 are collections of total functions mapping D\u03b1 into D\u03b2 .\nAn interpretation is a tuple \u3008{D\u03b1}\u03b1\u2208T , I\u3009 where {D\u03b1}\u03b1\u2208T is a frame and where function I maps each typed constant c\u03b1 to an appropriate element of D\u03b1 , which is called the denotation of c\u03b1 .

H is called a standard model if and only if for all \u03b1 and \u03b2 , D\u03b1 \u03b2 is the set of all functions from D\u03b1 into D\u03b2 . It is easy to verify that each standard model is also a Henkin model. A formula A of HOL is valid in a Henkin model H if and only if V (\u03c6 ,A) = T for all variable assignments \u03c6 .

The Henkin model H M = \u3008{D\u03b1}\u03b1\u2208T , I\u3009 for M is defined as follows: Di is chosen as the set of possible worlds S, Du is chosen as the first-order domain D (cf. definition of \u230agiv\u230b), Di o is chosen as the set of sets of possible worlds Q (cf. definition of \u230agpv\u230b)1, and all other sets D\u03b1 \u03b2 are chosen as (not necessarily full) sets of functions from D\u03b1 to D\u03b2 .

(Soundness) The proof is by contraposition. Assume 6|= \u03d5 in CK, that is, there is a model M = \u3008S, f ,D,Q, I\u3009, a variable assignment g and a world s \u2208 S, such that M ,g,s 6|= \u03d5 .

Hence, H M 6|= (vld \u230a\u03d5\u230b), and thus 6|= (vld \u230a\u03d5\u230b) in HOL.\n(Completeness) The proof is again by contraposition.

Without loss of generality we can assume that Henkin Model H is in fact a Henkin model H M for a corresponding quantified conditional logic model M and that \u03a6 = \u230ag\u230b for a corresponding quantified conditional logic variable assignment g. By Prop. 3.1 and since (vld \u230a\u03d5\u230b) =\u03b2\u03b7 (\u2200Si.\u230a\u03d5\u230b S) we have V (\u230ag\u230b,(\u2200Si.\u230a\u03d5\u230b S)) = F , and hence, by definition of vld, V (\u230ag\u230b[s/Si],\u230a\u03d5\u230b S) = F for some s\u2208 D. By Lemma 5.3 we thus know that M ,g,s 6|= \u03d5 , and hence 6|= \u03d5 in CK."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented an embedding of quantified conditional logics in HOL. This embedding enables the uniform application of higher-order automated theorem provers and model finders for reasoning about and within quantified conditional logics. In previous work we have studied related embeddings in HOL, including propositional conditional logics [3] and quantified multimodal logics [5]. First experiments with these embeddings have provided evidence for their practical relevance. Moreover, an independent case study on reasoning in quantified modal logics shows that the embeddings based approach may even outperform specialist reasoners quantified modal logics [12]. Future work will investigate whether HOL reasoners perform similarly well also for quantified conditional logics. For a first impression of such studies we refer to the Appendices A and B, where we also present the concrete encoding of our embedding in TPTP THF0 [11] syntax. Unfortunately we are not aware of any other (direct or indirect) prover for quantified conditional logics that could be used for comparison."}, {"heading": "A The Embedding of Quantified Conditional Logic in HOL in THF0 Syntax", "text": "We present an encoding of our embedding of quantified conditional logics in HOL in the TPTP THF0 [11] syntax.\nSatisfiability of this embedding is shown by the HOL reasoner Satallax3 in only 0.01 seconds.\n%--------------------------------------------------------------------- %---- reserved constant for selection function f thf(f_type,type,(\nf: $i > ( $i > $o ) > $i > $o )).\n%---- \u2019not\u2019 in conditional logic thf(cnot_type,type,(\ncnot: ( $i > $o ) > $i > $o )).\nthf(cnot_def,definition,\n( cnot = ( ^ [Phi: $i > $o,X: $i] :\n~ ( Phi @ X ) ) )).\n%---- \u2019or\u2019 in conditional logic thf(cor_type,type,(\ncor: ( $i > $o ) > ( $i > $o ) > $i > $o )).\nthf(cor_def,definition,\n( cor = ( ^ [Phi: $i > $o,Psi: $i > $o,X: $i] :\n( ( Phi @ X ) | ( Psi @ X ) ) ) )).\n%---- \u2019true\u2019 in conditional logic thf(ctrue_type,type,(\nctrue: $i > $o )).\nthf(ctrue_def,definition,\n( ctrue\n3http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~cebrown/satallax/\n= ( ^ [X: $i] : $true ) )).\n%---- \u2019false\u2019 in conditional logic thf(cfalse_type,type,(\ncfalse: $i > $o )).\nthf(cfalse_def,definition,\n( cfalse = ( ^ [X: $i] : $false ) )).\n%---- \u2019conditional implication\u2019 in conditional logic thf(ccond_type,type,(\nccond: ( $i > $o ) > ( $i > $o ) > $i > $o )).\nthf(ccond_def,definition,\n( ccond = ( ^ [Phi: $i > $o,Psi: $i > $o,X: $i] :\n!
