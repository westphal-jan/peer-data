In this paper, we adopt the position that it is time for more computationallyoriented research on problems involving framing. In the interests of furthering that goal, we propose the following specific, interesting and, we believe, relatively accessible question: In the controversy regarding the use of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture, do pro- and anti-GMO articles differ in whether they choose to adopt a more \u201cscientific\u201d tone?\nPrior work on the rhetoric and sociology of science suggests that hedging may distinguish popular-science text from text written by professional scientists for their colleagues. We propose a detailed approach to studying whether hedge detection can be used to understanding scientific framing in the GMO debates, and provide corpora to facilitate this study. Some of our preliminary analyses suggest that hedges occur less frequently in scientific discourse than in popular text, a finding that contradicts prior assertions in the literature. We hope that our initial work and data will encourage others to pursue this promising line of inquiry.\nPublication venue: ACL Workshop on ExtraPropositional Aspects of Meaning in Computational Linguistics, 2012"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": ""}, {"heading": "1.1 Framing, \u201cscientific discourse\u201d, and GMOs in the media", "text": "The issue of framing (Goffman, 1974; Scheufele, 1999; Benford and Snow, 2000) is of great importance in understanding how public opinion is formed. In their Annual Review of Political Science survey, Chong and Druckman (2007) describe framing effects as occurring \u201cwhen (often small) changes in the presentation of an issue or an event produce (sometimes large) changes of opinion\u201d (p. 104); as an example, they cite a study wherein respondents answered differently, when asked whether a hate group should be allowed to hold a rally, depending on whether the question was phrased as one of \u201cfree speech\u201d or one of \u201crisk of violence\u201d.\nThe genesis of our work is in a framing question motivated by a relatively current political issue. In media coverage of transgenic crops and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food, do pro-GMO vs. anti-GMO articles differ not just with respect to word choice, but in adopting a more \u201cscientific\u201d discourse, meaning the inclusion of more uncertainty and fewer emotionally-laden words? We view this as an interesting question from a text analysis perspective (with potential applications and implications that lie outside the scope of this article)."}, {"heading": "1.2 Hedging as a sign of scientific discourse", "text": "To obtain a computationally manageable characterization of \u201cscientific discourse\u201d, we turned to studies of the culture and language of science, a body of work spanning fields ranging from sociology to\napplied linguistics to rhetoric and communication (Gilbert and Mulkay, 1984; Latour, 1987; Latour and Woolgar, 1979; Halliday and Martin, 1993; Bazerman, 1988; Fahnestock, 2004; Gross, 1990).\nOne characteristic that has drawn quite a bit of attention in such studies is hedging (Myers, 1989; Hyland, 1998; Lewin, 1998; Salager-Meyer, 2011).1 Hyland (1998, pg. 1) defines hedging as the expression of \u201ctentativeness and possibility\u201d in communication, or, to put it another way, language corresponding to \u201cthe writer withholding full commitment to statements\u201d (pg. 3). He supplies many real-life examples from scientific research articles, including the following:\n1. \u2018It seems that this group plays a critical role in orienting the carboxyl function\u2019 (emphasis Hyland\u2019s)\n2. \u2018...implies that phytochrome A is also not necessary for normal photomorphogenesis, at least under these irradiation conditions\u2019 (emphasis Hyland\u2019s)\n3. \u2018We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (D.N.A.)\u2019 (emphasis added)2\nSeveral scholars have asserted the centrality of hedging in scientific and academic discourse, which corresponds nicely to the notion of \u201cmore uncertainty\u201d mentioned above. Hyland (1998, p. 6) writes, \u201cDespite a widely held belief that professional scientific writing is a series of impersonal statements of fact which add up to the truth, hedges are abundant in science and play a critical role in academic writing\u201d. Indeed, Myers (1989, p. 13) claims that in scientific research articles, \u201cThe hedging of claims is so common that a sentence that looks like a claim but has no hedging is probably not a statement of new knowledge\u201d.3\nNot only is understanding hedges important to understanding the rhetoric and sociology of science,\n1In linguistics, hedging has been studied since the 1970s (Lakoff, 1973).\n2This example originates from Watson and Crick\u2019s landmark 1953 paper. Although the sentence is overtly tentative, did Watson and Crick truly intend to be polite and modest in their claims? See Varttala (2001) for a review of arguments regarding this question.\n3Note the inclusion of the hedge \u201cprobably\u201d.\nbut hedge detection and analysis \u2014 in the sense of identifying uncertain or uncertainly-sourced information (Farkas et al., 2010) \u2014 has important applications to information extraction, broadly construed, and has thus become an active sub-area of naturallanguage processing. For example, the CoNLL 2010 Shared Task was devoted to this problem (Farkas et al., 2010).\nPutting these two lines of research together, we see before us what appears to be an interesting interdisciplinary and, at least in principle, straightforward research program: relying on the aforementioned rhetoric analyses to presume that hedging is a key characteristic of scientific discourse, build a hedge-detection system to computationally ascertain which proponents in the GMO debate tend to use more hedges and thus, by presumption, tend to adopt a more \u201cscientific\u201d frame.4"}, {"heading": "1.3 Contributions", "text": "Our overarching goal in this paper is to convince more researchers in NLP and computational linguistics to work on problems involving framing. We try to do so by proposing a specific problem that may be relatively accessible. Despite the apparent difficulty in addressing such questions, we believe that progress can be made by drawing on observations drawn from previous literature across many fields, and integrating such work with movements in the computational community toward consideration of extra-propositional and pragmatic concerns. We have thus intentionally tried to \u201ccover a lot of ground\u201d, as one referee put it, in the introductory material just discussed.\nSince framing problems are indeed difficult, we elected to narrow our scope in the hope of making some partial progress. Our technical goal here, at this workshop, where hedge detection is one of the most relevant topics to the broad questions we have raised, is not to learn to classify texts as being provs. anti-GMO, or as being scientific or not, per se.5\n4However, this presumption that more hedges characterize a more scientific discourse has been contested. See section 2 for discussion and section 4.2 for our empirical investigation.\n5Several other groups have addressed the problem of trying to identify different sides or perspectives (Lin et al., 2006; Hardisty et al., 2010; Beigman Klebanov et al., 2010; Ahmed and Xing, 2010).\nOur focus is on whether hedging specifically, considered as a single feature, is correlated with these different document classes, because of the previous research attention that has been devoted to hedging in particular and because of hedging being one of the topics of this workshop. The point of this paper is thus not to compare the efficacy of hedging features with other types, such as bag-of-words features. Of course, to do so is an important and interesting direction for future work.\nIn the end, we were not able to achieve satisfactory results even with respect to our narrowed goal. However, we believe that other researchers may be able to follow the plan of attack we outline below, and perhaps use the data we are releasing, in order to achieve our goal. We would welcome hearing the results of other people\u2019s efforts.\n2 How should we test whether hedging distinguishes scientific text?\nOne very important point that we have not yet addressed is: While the literature agrees on the importance of hedging in scientific text, the relative degree of hedging in scientific vs. non-scientific text is a matter of debate.\nOn the one side, we have assertions like those of Fahnestock (1986), who shows in a clever, albeit small-scale, study involving parallel texts that when scientific observations pass into popular accounts, changes include \u201cremoving hedges ... thus conferring greater certainty on the reported facts\u201d (pg. 275). Similarly, Juanillo, Jr. (2001) refers to a shift from a forensic style to a \u201ccelebratory\u201d style when scientific research becomes publicized, and credits Brown (1998) with noting that \u201ccelebratory scientific discourses tend to pay less attention to caveats, contradictory evidence, and qualifications that are highlighted in forensic or empiricist discourses. By downplaying scientific uncertainty, it [sic] alludes to greater certainty of scientific results for public consumption\u201d (Juanillo, Jr., 2001, p. 42).\nHowever, others have contested claims that the popularization process involves simplification, distortion, hype, and dumbing down, as Myers (2003) colorfully puts it; he provides a critique of the relevant literature. Varttala (1999) ran a corpus analysis in which hedging was found not just in pro-\nfessional medical articles, but was also \u201ctypical of popular scientific articles dealing with similar topics\u201d (p. 195). Moreover, significant variation in use of hedging has been found across disciplines and authors\u2019 native language; see Salager-Meyer (2011) or Varttala (2001) for a review.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there have been no large-scale empirical studies validating the hypothesis that hedges appear more or less frequently in scientific discourse.\nProposed procedure Given the above, our first step must be to determine whether hedges are more or less prominent in \u201cprofessional scientific\u201d (henceforth \u201cprof-science\u2019\u2019) vs. \u201cpublic science\u201d (henceforth \u201cpop-science\u201d) discussions of GMOs. Of course, for a large-scale study, finding hedges requires developing and training an effective hedge detection algorithm.\nIf the first step shows that hedges can indeed be used to effectively distinguish prof-science vs. popscience discourse on GMOs, then the second step is to examine whether the use of hedging in pro-GMO articles follows our inferred \u201cscientific\u201d occurrence patterns to a greater extent than the hedging in antiGMO articles.\nHowever, as our hedge classifier trained on the CoNLL dataset did not perform reliably on the different domain of prof-science vs. pop-science discussions of GMOs, we focus the main content of this paper on the first step. We describe data collection for the second step in the appendix."}, {"heading": "3 Data", "text": "To accomplish the first step of our proposed procedure outlined above, we first constructed a profscience/pop-science corpus by pulling text from Web of Science for prof-science examples and from LexisNexis for pop-science examples, as described in Section 3.1. Our corpus will be posted online at https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/llresearch/ HedgingFramingGMOs.\nAs noted above, computing the degree of hedging in the aforementioned corpus requires access to a hedge-detection algorithm. We took a supervised approach, taking advantage of the availability of the CoNLL 2010 hedge-detection training and evaluation corpora, described in Section 3.2"}, {"heading": "3.1 Prof-science/pop-science data: LEXIS and WOS", "text": "As mentioned previously, a corpus of prof-science and pop-science articles is required to ascertain whether hedges are more prevalent in one or the other of these two writing styles. Since our ultimate goal is to look at discourse related to GMOs, we restrict our attention to documents on this topic.\nThomson Reuter\u2019s Web of Science (WOS), a database of scientific journal and conference articles, was used as a source of prof-science samples. We chose to collect abstracts, rather than full scientific articles, because intuition suggests that the language in abstracts is more high-level than that in the bodies of papers, and thus more similar to the language one would see in a public debate on GMOs. To select for on-topic abstracts, we used the phrase \u201ctransgenic foods\u201d as a search keyword and discarded results containing any of a hand-selected list of off-topic filtering terms (e.g., \u201cmice\u201d or \u201crats\u201d). We then made use of domain expertise to manually remove off-topic texts. The process yielded 648 documents for a total of 5596 sentences.\nOur source of pop-science articles was LexisNexis (LEXIS). On-topic documents were collected from US newspapers using the search keywords \u201cgenetically modified foods\u201d or \u201ctransgenic crops\u201d and then imposing the additional requirement that at least two terms on a hand-selected list7 be present in each document.

As \u201cuncertainty detection is extremely important for biomedical information extraction\u201d, one component of the dataset is biological abstracts and full articles from the BioScope corpus (Bio). Meanwhile, the chief editors of Wikipedia have drawn the attention of the public to specific markers of uncertainty known as weasel words9: they are words or phrases \u201caimed at creating an impression that something specific and meaningful has been said\u201d, when, in fact, \u201conly a vague or ambiguous claim, or even a refutation, has been communicated\u201d.

Thus, another part of the dataset is a set of Wikipedia articles (Wiki) annotated with weaselword information.

To get an initial feeling for how frequently hedges occur in WOS and LEXIS, we hand-annotated a sample of sentences from each. In Section 4.1, we explain the annotation policy of the CoNLL 2010 Shared Task and our own annotation method for WOS and LEXIS. After that, we move forward in Section 4.2 to compare the percentage of uncertain sentences in prof-science vs. pop-science text on this small hand-labeled sample, and gain some evidence that there is indeed a difference in hedge occurrence rates, although, perhaps surprisingly, there seem to be more hedges in the pop-science texts.\nAs a side benefit, we subsequently use the hand-labeled sample we produce to investigate the accuracy of an automatic hedge detector in the WOS+LEXIS domain; more on this in Section 5."}, {"heading": "4.1 Uncertainty annotation", "text": "CoNLL 2010 Shared Task annotation policy As described in Farkas et al. (2010, pg. 4), the data annotation polices for the CoNLL 2010 Shared Task were that \u201csentences containing at least one cue were considered as uncertain, while sentences with no cues were considered as factual\u201d, where a cue is a linguistic marker that in context indicates uncertainty. A straightforward example of a sentence marked \u201cuncertain\u201d in the Shared Task is \u2018Mild bladder wall thickening raises the question of cystitis.\u2019 The annotated cues are not necessarily general, particularly in Wiki, where some of the marked cues are as specific as \u2018some of schumann\u2019s best choral writing\u2019, \u2018people of the jewish tradition\u2019, or \u2018certain leisure or cultural activities\u2019.\nNote that \u201cuncertainty\u201d in the Shared Task definition also encompassed phrasing that \u201ccreates an\nimpression that something important has been said, but what is really communicated is vague, misleading, evasive or ambiguous ... [offering] an opinion without any backup or source\u201d. An example of such a sentence, drawn from Wikipedia and marked \u201cuncertain\u201d in the Shared Task, is \u2018Some people claim that this results in a better taste than that of other diet colas (most of which are sweetened with aspartame alone).\u2019; Farkas et al. (2010) write, \u201cThe ... sentence does not specify the source of the information, it is just the vague term \u2018some people\u2019 that refers to the holder of this opinion\u201d.\nOur annotation policy We hand-annotated 200 randomly-sampled sentences, half from WOS and half from LEXIS10, to gauge the frequency with which hedges occur in each corpus. Two annotators each followed the rules of the CoNLL 2010 Shared Task to label sentences as certain, uncertain, or not a proper sentence.11 The annotators agreed on 153 proper sentences of the 200 sentences (75 from WOS and 78 from LEXIS). Cohen\u2019s Kappa (Fleiss, 1981) was 0.67 on the annotation, which means that the consistency between the two annotators was fair or good. However, there were some interesting cases where the two annotators could not agree. For example, in the sentence \u2018Cassava is the staple food of tropical Africa and its production, averaged over 24 countries, has increased more than threefold from 1980 to 2005 ... \u2019, one of the annotators believed that \u201cmore than\u201d made the sentence uncertain. These borderline cases indicate that the definition of hedging should be carefully delineated in future studies."}, {"heading": "4.2 Percentages of uncertain sentences", "text": "To validate the hypothesis that prof-science articles contain more hedges, we computed the percentage of uncertain sentences in our labeled data.

The same trend was seen in the CoNLL dataset: there, too, the percentage of uncertain sentences was significantly smaller in Bio (prof-science articles) than in Wiki. In order to make a stronger argument about prof-science vs pop-science, however, more annotation on the WOS and LEXIS datasets is needed."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "As stated in Section 1, our proposal requires developing an effective hedge detection algorithm. Our approach for the preliminary work described in this paper is to re-implement Georgescul\u2019s (2010) algorithm; the experimental results on the Bio+Wiki domain, given in Section 5.1, are encouraging. Then we use this method to attempt to validate (at a larger scale than in our manual pilot annotation) whether hedges can be used to distinguish between profscience and pop-science discourse on GMOs. Unfortunately, our results, given in Section 5.2, are inconclusive, since our trained model could not achieve satisfactory automatic hedge-detection accuracy on the WOS+LEXIS domain."}, {"heading": "5.1 Method", "text": "We adopted the method of Georgescul (2010): Support Vector Machine classification based on a Gaussian Radial Basis kernel function (Vapnik, 1998; Fan et al., 2005), employing n-grams from annotated cue phrases as features, as described in more detail below. This method achieved the top performance in the CoNLL 2010 Wikipedia hedge-detection task (Farkas et al., 2010), and SVMs have been proven effective for many different applications. We used the LIBSVM toolkit in our experiments13.\n12Throughout, \u201cstatistical significance\u201d refers to the student t-test with p < .05.\n13http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/\u223ccjlin/libsvm/\nAs described in Section 3.2, there are two separate datasets in the CoNLL dataset. We experimented on them separately (Bio, Wiki). Also, to make our classifier more generalizable to different datasets, we also trained models based on the two datasets combined (Bio+Wiki). As for features, we took advantage of the observation in Georgescul (2010) that the bag-of-words model does not work well for this task. We used different sets of features based on hedge cue words that have been annotated as part of the CoNLL dataset distribution14 . The basic feature set was the frequency of each hedge cue word from the training corpus after removing stop words and punctuation and transforming words to lowercase. Then, we extracted unigrams, bigrams and trigrams from each hedge cue phrase. Table 3 shows the number of features in different settings. Notice that there are many more features in Wiki. As mentioned above, in Wiki, some cues are as specific as \u2018some of schumann\u2019s best choral writing\u2019, \u2018people of the jewish tradition\u2019, or \u2018 certain leisure or cultural activities\u2019. Taking n-grams from such specific cues can cause some sentences to be classified incorrectly.\nWe adopted several techniques from Georgescul 14For the Bio model, we used cues extracted from Bio. Likewise, the Wiki model used cues from Wiki, and the Bio+Wiki model used cues from Bio+Wiki.\n(2010) to optimize performance through cross validation. Specifically, we tried different combinations of feature sets (the cue phrases themselves, cues + unigram, cues + bigram, cues + trigram, cues + unigram + bigram + trigram, cues + bigram + trigram). We tuned the width of the RBF kernel (\u03b3) and the regularization parameter (C) via grid search over the following range of values: {2\u22129, 2\u22128, 2\u22127, . . . , 24} for \u03b3, {1, 10, 20, 30, . . . , 150} for C . We also tried different weighting strategies for negative and positive classes (i.e., either proportional to the number of positive instances, or uniform). We performed 5- fold cross validation for each possible combination of experimental settings on the three datasets (Bio, Wiki, Bio+Wiki).\nTable 4 shows the best performance on all three datasets and the corresponding parameters. In the three datasets, cue+bigram+trigram provided the best performance, and the weighted model consistently produced superior results to the uniform model. The F1 measure for Bio was 87.8, which was satisfactory, while the F1 results for Wiki were 69.6, which were the worst of all the datasets. This resonates with our observation that the task on Wikipedia is more subtly defined and thus requires a more sophisticated approach than counting the occurrences of bigrams and trigrams."}, {"heading": "5.2 Results on WOS+LEXIS", "text": "Next, we evaluated whether our best classifier trained on the CoNLL dataset can be generalized to other datasets, in particular, the WOS and LEXIS corpus. Performance was measured on the 153 sen-\ntences on which our annotators agreed, a dataset that was introduced in Section 4.1. Table 5 shows how the best models trained on Bio, Wiki, and Bio+Wiki, respectively, performed on the 153 labeled sentences. First, we can see that the performance degraded significantly compared to the performance for in-domain cross validation. Second, of the three different models, Bio showed the best performance. Bio+Wiki gave the worst performance, which hints that combining two datasets and cue words may not be a promising strategy: although Bio+Wiki shows very good recall, this can be attributed to its larger feature set, which contains all available cues and perhaps as a result has a very high false-positive rate. We further investigated and compared performance on LEXIS and WOS for the best model (Bio). Not surprisingly, our classifier works better in WOS than in LEXIS.\nIt is clear that there exist domain differences between the CoNLL dataset and WOS+LEXIS. To better understand the poor cross-domain performance of the classifier, we tuned another model based on the performance on the 153 labeled sentences using Bio as training data. As we can see in Table 6, the performance on WOS improved significantly, while the performance on LEXIS decreased. This is probably caused by the fact that WOS is a collection of scientific paper abstracts, which is more similar to the training corpus than LEXIS, which is a collection of news media articles15. Also, LEXIS articles are hard to classify even with the tuned model, which challenges the effectiveness of a cuewords frequency approach beyond professional scientific texts. Indeed, the simplicity of our reim-\n15The Wiki model performed better on LEXIS than on WOS. Though the performance was not good, this result further reinforces the possibility of a domain-dependence problem.\nplementation of Georgescul\u2019s algorithm seems to cause longer sentences to be classified as uncertain, because cue phrases (or n-grams extracted from cue phrases) are more likely to appear in lengthier sentences. Analysis of the best performing model shows that the false-positive sentences are significantly longer than the false-negative ones.16\nWhile the cross-domain results were not reliable, we produced preliminary results on whether there exist fewer hedges in scientific text. We can see that the relative difference in certain/uncertain ratios predicted by the two different models (Bio, Tuned) are different in Table 7. In the tuned model, the difference between LEXIS and WOS in terms of the percentage of uncertain sentences was not statistically significant, while in the Bio model, their difference was statistically significant. Since the performance of our hedge classifier on the 153 hand-annotated WOS+LEXIS sentences was not reliable, though, we must abstain from making conclusive statements here."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and future work", "text": "In this position paper, we advocated that researchers apply hedge detection not only to the classic motivation of information-extraction problems, but also to questions of how public opinion forms. We proposed a particular problem in how participants in debates frame their arguments.

Inspired by\n16Average length of true positive sentences : 28.6, false positive sentences 35.09, false negative sentences: 22.0.\nearlier studies in social sciences relating hedging to texts aimed at professional scientists, we proposed addressing the question with automatic hedge detection as a first step. To develop a hedge classifier, we took advantage of the CoNLL dataset and a small annotated WOS and LEXIS dataset. Our preliminary results show there may exist a gap which indicates that hedging may, in fact, distinguish prof-science and pop-science documents. In fact, this computational analysis suggests the possibility that hedges occur less frequently in scientific prose, which contradicts several prior assertions in the literature.\nTo confirm the argument that pop-science tends to use more hedging than prof-science, we need a hedge classifier that performs more reliably in the WOS and LEXIS dataset than ours does. An interesting research direction would be to develop transfer-learning techniques to generalize hedge classifiers for different datasets, or to develop a general hedge classifier relatively robust to domain differences. In either case, more annotated data on WOS and LEXIS is needed for better evaluation or training.\nAnother strategy would be to bypass the first step, in which we determine whether hedges are more or less prominent in scientific discourse, and proceed directly to labeling and hedge-detection in proGMO and anti-GMO texts. However, this will not answer the question of whether advocates in debates other than on GMO-related topics employ a more scientific discourse. Nonetheless, to aid those who wish to pursue this alternate strategy, we have collected two sets of opinionated articles on GMO (proand anti-); see appendix for more details.\nAcknowledgments We thank Daniel Hopkins and Bonnie Webber for reference suggestions, and the anonymous reviewers for helpful and thoughtful comments.

This led us to collect documents from more strongly opinionated organizational websites such as Greenpeace (anti-GMO), Non GMO Project (anti-GMO), or Why Biotechnology (pro-GMO). Articles were collected from 20 pro-GMO and 20 anti-GMO organizational web sites.\nAfter the initial collection of data, near-duplicates and irrelevant articles were filtered through clustering, keyword searches and distance between word vectors at the document level. We have collected 762 \u201canti\u201d documents and 671 \u201cpro\u201d documents. We reduced this to a 404 \u201cpro\u201d and 404 \u201ccon\u201d set as follows. Each retained \u201cdocument\u201d consists of only the first 200 words after excluding the first 50 words of documents containing over 280 words.

In this paper, we adopt the position that it is time for more computationallyoriented research on problems involving framing. In the interests of furthering that goal, we propose the following specific, interesting and, we believe, relatively accessible question: In the controversy regarding the use of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture, do proand anti-GMO articles differ in whether they choose to adopt a more \u201cscientific\u201d tone? Prior work on the rhetoric and sociology of science suggests that hedging may distinguish popular-science text from text written by professional scientists for their colleagues. We propose a detailed approach to studying whether hedge detection can be used to understanding scientific framing in the GMO debates, and provide corpora to facilitate this study. Some of our preliminary analyses suggest that hedges occur less frequently in scientific discourse than in popular text, a finding that contradicts prior assertions in the literature. We hope that our initial work and data will encourage others to pursue this promising line of inquiry.
