Introduction", "text": "Time series analysis and modeling have been extensively studied in the literature and successfully found applications across domains (Box & Jenkins, 1990; Hamilton, 1994). In many applications, such as climate science, social media analysis and smart grid, we are mostly interested in revealing the temporal dependence and make predictions of extreme events.

Therefore quantifying the temporal dependence between the extreme events from different locations and make effective predictions are important for disaster prevention; in social media analysis, burst of topics, i.e., buzz, is reflected by extremely high frequency of related words. Uncovering the temporal dependencies between buzzes could reveal valuable insights into information propagation and achieve much better accuracy for buzz prediction.\nIdentifying temporal dependencies between multiple time-series data is a topic of significant interest (Arnold et al., 2007; Lozano et al., 2009a;b). Many algorithms are proposed to automatically recover the temporal structures, such as autocorrelation, crosscorrelations (Box & Jenkins, 1990), randomization test (Edgington & Onghena, 2007), Granger causality (Granger, 1980), transfer entropy (Beirlant et al., 1997; Barnett et al., 2009), and so on. However, uncovering temporal dependency for extreme values is much more challenging than classical observations since the distributions of extreme values are more complex and significantly different from the commonly used Gaussian distribution. In addition, the lack of sufficient past observations on extreme events poses difficulties in modeling and attributing such events.\nThe statistical approach we can utilize to solve these important problems is the theory of extreme value modeling (Coles, 2001; Beirlant et al., 2004), which provides a natural family of probability distributions for modeling the magnitude of the largest (or smallest) of a large number of events, and a canonical stochastic process model (Coles, 2001) for the occurrence of events above a very high (or below a very low) threshold. In the past decade, extreme value modeling has attracted a lot of research efforts in statistics, finance,\nand environmental science, particularly on modeling temporal and spatio-temporal extreme value (Coles & Tawn, 1996; Ferro & Segers, 2003; Huerta & Sanso, 2007). However, all of the work above model temporal or spatial dependence with predefined covariance structures (e.g. without independence considerations). Furthermore, most general discussions of dependencies in multivariate extreme value modeling has been focused on pairwise relationships. This is obviously unrealistic and demands a significant contribution on automatically learning the temporal structures from the data for better analysis and modeling.\nIn this paper, we propose a sparse latent space model, namely sparse-GEV model, to solve the problem. The basic idea of our approach is to model the multivariate extreme value time series as a latent space model. The latent variables, corresponding to the location parameters (which determine the mode) of extreme value distributions for time series at certain time, are modeled by the location parameters of all time series in history, through a dynamic linear model (DLM). By imposing an L1-penalty with respect to the regression coefficients in DLM, we could establish meaningful temporal dependencies between a small subset of time series and the concerned time series of extreme values. To estimate parameters of the model, we develop a iterative searching algorithm based on the generalized EMalgorithms and sampling with particle filtering. Our model is significant because it is among the first models to reveal the temporal dependencies between multiple extreme value time series. In addition, our experiment results demonstrate the superior performance of our model to other state-of-art methods on both learning temporal dependence and predicting future value.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: we first describe the details of our proposed model in Section 2, then we review the existing work and discuss their connections to our model in Section 3, we show the experiment results in Section 4, and finally we summarize the paper with hints on future work."}, {"heading": "2. Methodology", "text": "Preliminaries Before diving into the details of our model, we first briefly review the extreme value theory (Coles, 2001). Let X1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Xm be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, and let Mm = max{X1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Xm}.

(3)\nIt has been shown that the maximum value in a sample of a random variable following an exponential family distribution (such as Gaussian, Lognormal and Gamma distributions) converge to the Gumbel distribution. One special property of the Gumbel distribution is that the mode is determined solely by the location parameter \u00b5."}, {"heading": "2.1. Model Description", "text": "Given multivariate time series data, our goal is to build an effective model that can recover temporal dependence between extreme value time series (block maxima or peaks over threshold) and make accurate predictions for future extreme events. To achieve a robust and interpretable model, a natural choice is to capture the temporal dependence via linear models; however, this is not directly achievable on extreme value variables since their temporal dependence is obviously nonlinear. To solve the problem, we propose latent models in which the location parameters of GEV distributions are latent variables and the temporal dependence between extreme value variables is captured via the latent variables through dynamic linear model. We choose the location parameters because they capture the mode of extreme value variables and can be modeled reasonably well by linear dependence.\nFormally, let x1, . . . ,xP denote P number of extreme value time series and each time series xi have T observations, i.e., xi = {xi1, . . . , xiT }1, we define the joint\n1 In extreme value theory, two main sets of methods, the Block Maxima method and the Peaks over Thresholds method have been developed to model extreme values (Coles, 2001). In the rest of the paper, we use Block Maxima method as an example to describe our model. Notice that our methodology is applicable to the Peaks over Thresholds approach by defining a point process model and in the experiments we have used both approaches.\nprobability of observations {xit} and their associated location parameter {\u00b5it} as:\np({xit}, {\u00b5it}|\u03b2,\u03c3, c) = (4) P\u220f i=1 T\u220f t=L+1 p(xit|\u00b5it, \u03c3i)p(\u00b5it|{\u00b5 j t\u2212l},\u03b2, c),\nwhere p(xit|\u00b5it, \u03c3i) can be modeled by a GEV distribution such as the Gumbel distribution in eq(3) with \u03c3i as the scale parameter specific to time series xi, {\u00b5jt\u2212l} is the history of all time series at time t with a maximal lag of L, and p(\u00b5it|{\u00b5 j t\u2212l},\u03b2, c) can be modeled by a dynamic linear model as follows,\n\u00b5it = c i + L\u2211 l=1 P\u2211 j=1 \u03b2ij,l\u00b5 j t\u2212l + . (5)\nwhere ci is the offset specific to time series i, \u03b2i are the coefficients, and is a Gaussian noise with variance \u03c42. As we can see, the temporal dependence between xi and xj is now captured via the coefficients \u03b2. By adding a shrinkage Laplace prior over \u03b2 when maximizing the likelihood function, i.e.,\n{\u03b2\u0302, \u03c3\u0302, c\u0302} = arg max `(x1, . . . ,xP ;\u03b2,\u03c3, c)+ P\u2211 i=1 \u03bb\u2016\u03b2i\u20161, (6) where \u03bb is the regularization parameter, we can obtain the sparse solution of \u03b2. Finally, we determine that xi temporally depends on xj if the corresponding value of \u03b2ij is non-zero. In this way, our model not only can provide better understanding of potential causes of the extreme events, but also helps to achieve more accurate prediction of the extreme events in the future. This model is later referred to as the SparseGEV model."}, {"heading": "2.2. Inference and Learning", "text": "Given the existence of hidden variables in the sparseGEV model, directly maximizing the likelihood as in eq(6) is not feasible. Therefore we applied the generalized EM-algorithm to solve the problem.\nNext, we use Gumbel distribution as an example to demonstrate how we can make efficient inference and learning in the proposed model. In the EM algorithm, we optimize the following function via two steps:\nQ(\u03b2,\u03c3, c;\u03b2old,\u03c3old, cold) = \u2212 P\u2211\ni=1 T\u2211 t=L+1 ln(\u03c3i)\n\u2212 E{\u00b5|X,\u03b2old,\u03c3old,cold} [ xit \u2212 \u00b5it \u03c3i + exp ( \u2212x i t \u2212 \u00b5it \u03c3i )\n+ 1\n2\n( \u00b5it \u2212 ci \u2212 \u2211L l=1 \u2211P j=1 \u03b2 i j,l\u00b5 j t\u2212l\n\u03c4 )2 . (7) E Step Directly calculating the expectations in eq(7) is infeasible given the form of the posterior probability, therefore we apply sampling algorithms for approximation. In order to generate samples from p { \u00b5|X,\u03b2old,\u03c3old, cold } , we use the particle filtering algorithm (Doucet & Johansen, 2009). The major challenge is that in each iteration of particle filtering, we need to draw samples from p(\u00b5it|xit, {\u00b5 j t\u2212l}), which cannot be calculated analytically. Instead, we use the following proposal function:\nN ( \u00b5\u0303it + \u03b3i\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3iW0 ( \u03b32i exp ( \u00b5\u0303it \u2212 xit \u03c3i + \u03b32i )) , \u03c42\n\u03b32i + 1\n) ,\nwhere W0 is the Lambert W function, \u03b3i = \u03c4/\u03c3i, and \u00b5\u0303it is calculated using the history, i.e., \u00b5\u0303 i t =\nci,old + \u2211L l=1 \u2211P j=1 \u03b2 i,old j,l \u00b5\u0303 j t\u2212l. The rationale behind\nthis choice is to approximate the posterior distribution p { \u00b5|X,\u03b2old,\u03c3old, cold } with a Gaussian distribution with the same mode and similar variance.\nNotice that particle filtering may encounter the challenge of \u201cminiscule weights\u201d if the sequence length is long. Therefore the resampling step is usually applied at each time stamp to resolve the issue (Doucet & Johansen, 2009). For very long time series, particle filtering does face some other challenges, but can be fixed using particle smoothing (Doucet & Johansen, 2009).\nM Step The optimization problem for updating \u03b2i and ci is as follows:\nmin \u03b2i,ci\nE\u00b5|x T\u2211\nt=L+1 \u00b5it \u2212 ci \u2212 L\u2211 l=1 P\u2211 j=1 \u03b2ij,l\u00b5 j t\u2212l 2 + \u03bb \u2225\u2225\u03b2i\u2225\u2225 1 ,\nwhere the expectation is computed from the samples. As we can see, the optimization function has the Lasso format and can be solved efficiently by algorithms such as coordinate descent (Wu & Lange, 2008). The parameter estimation for the Gumbel distribution itself is not a trivial problem. In general, the MLE is the widely accepted approach to estimate the shape and scale parameters, and Newton-Raphson or quasiNewton methods can be applied to solve the resulting\noptimization problem (Evans et al., 2000). Therefore we estimate \u03c3 by the Newton-Raphson algorithm."}, {"heading": "2.3. Prediction", "text": "In order to make predictions on the future value of extreme events, for example xiT+1, given the extreme value time series up to time T , we can first estimate the mean \u00b5\u0304iT+1 using the samples drawn from the posterior distribution with the learned parameters. Based on the model defined in eq(4), we can predict xiT+1 as\nx\u0302iT+1 = \u00b5\u0304 i T+1 + \u03b3E\u03c3 i,\nwhere \u00b5\u0304iT+1 = c i + \u2211L l=1 \u2211P j=1 \u03b2 i j,l\u00b5\u0304 j T\u2212l+1, and \u03b3E(\u2248 0.5771) is the Euler constant."}, {"heading": "2.4. Scalability", "text": "The computational complexity of Sparse-GEV depends on two factors: the number of EM iterations required for convergence and the scalability of E-Step and M-Step. In Section 5, we empirically show that EM usually converges within a small number of iterations. In the M-Step, while there are efficient solvers for both equations, the problems for different time series are independent and can be implemented in parallel. The particle filtering in E-Step is notoriously efficient for sampling from time series mainly due to three reasons: (i) it requires only one iteration to generate the samples, (ii) the generated samples are independent; no burn-in period or decoupling is required and (iii) at each time stamp the sampling procedures in different locations are independent from each other and can be implemented in parallel. Therefore our algorithm is scalable and could be easily applicable to practical applications."}, {"heading": "3. Related Work and Discussions", "text": "Very recently, a few advanced approaches have been explored to uncover temporal dependence from time series data, including Lasso-Granger (Arnold et al., 2007), transfer entropy (Schreiber, 2000), and the copula approach (Liu et al., 2009). In this section, we discuss how these algorithms can be applicable to extreme value time series analysis and their connections to Sparse-GEV."}, {"heading": "3.1. Related Work", "text": "Granger causality In (Arnold et al., 2007), the Lasso-Ganger algorithm, an effective and efficient approach to learn sparse temporal graphs, is developed by combining Granger causality with sparse neighborhood selection using L1-penalized regression. More\nspecifically, given p number of time series, x1, . . . ,xp, where xi = {xit : t = 0, . . . , T}, let X Lagged t,L represent the concatenated vector of all the lagged variables (with a maximal lag of L) of up to time t, i.e., {xt\u2212lj : j = 1, . . . , p, l = 1, . . . , L}. Then the temporal graphs can be learned by the following regularized regression:\n\u03b2\u0302i(\u03bb) = arg min \u03b2i ( T\u2211 t=1 \u2016xti\u2212X Lagged t,L \u03b2i\u2016 2+\u03bb\u2016\u03b2i\u20161), (8)\nwhere there is an edge from xj to xi if and only if at least one of the corresponding coefficients in \u03b2\u0302i is non-zero. The Lasso-Granger algorithm can be directly applied to extreme value observations to infer the dependency graph, but obviously this violates the common assumptions of linear dependency in Granger causality.\nTransfer Entropy Solution Transfer entropy is usually employed when the data do not follow the autoregressive model and a nonlinear generalization of the Granger causality framework is desirable. In the Transfer entropy framework (Schreiber, 2000), time series xi is thought to be a cause of another time series xj if the values of xi in the past significantly decrease the uncertainty in the future values of xj given its past. The amount of decrease in the uncertainty can be quantified as\nTxi\u2192xj = H(x j t |xit\u2212L:t\u22121)\u2212H(x j t |x j t\u2212L:t\u22121, x i t\u2212L:t\u22121),\nwhere H(x) is the Shannon entropy of the random variable x. Since the transfer entropy is a pairwise quantity, we can use its output as input to a graph learning algorithm, for example, IAMB (Tsamardinos et al., 2003), to uncover the temporal dependency among multiple time series.\nThe transfer entropy approach can be used to uncover causality relationship among extreme value time series since it does not rely on any particular assumptions on the distribution of the time series.\nCopula Approach The copula approach has been proposed for dependency analysis of time series with non-Gaussian marginal distributions (Embrechts et al., 2002). It has been used for forecast in time series (Leong & Valdez, 2005) and learning sparase dependency structures (Liu et al., 2009). In a copula framework, e.g., Gaussian copula, the marginal distribution of the time series Xi are estimated as F\u0303i. Next the observations are transformed to the Gaussian copula domain as U it = \u03a6 \u22121(F\u0303i(X i t)), where \u03a6 is the cdf of the unit Gaussian distribution. Finally the temporal causal graph can be uncovered by analysis of dependency among U it using algorithms such as glasso\nalgorithm (Friedman et al., 2008). We report an edge from node i to node j if the precision matrix has at least one non-zero element from lagged U jt\u2212` to U i t , for ` \u2265 1. The method in (Leong & Valdez, 2005) can be used for predicting the future values of the time series.\nIn order to uncover temporal dependencies among extreme value time series, we can either estimate the marginals with a non-parametric density estimator or use the GEV distribution to estimate the marginal distribution. For extreme value time series, the latter is preferred since the non-parametric approximation of the marginal distributions could lead to over-fitting when the number of observations is scarce."}, {"heading": "3.2. Connections to existing algorithms", "text": "The connections between our algorithm with existing algorithms can be established by considering SparseGEV, transfer entropy and the copula approach as extensions of the Granger causality framework. The copula approach leverages the marginal distribution of the time series to map the observations to another space and assumes linear dependence in the new space. Sparse-GEV discovers the Granger causality relationship among the latent variables from which the observations have been generated. The transfer entropy approach generalizes the Granger causality framework by finding the Granger causality type relationships from the uncertainty of the time series. In fact, when the data are distributed according to Gaussian linear model, transfer entropy is equivalent to Granger causality (Barnett et al., 2009).\nFor high-dimensional time series, the number of observations is much less than the parameters of the model. The Lasso-Granger algorithm benefits from the variable selection properties of Lasso. (Meinshausen & Bu\u0308hlmann, 2006) show that the Lasso variable selection loss, and subsequently the Lasso-Granger\u2019s loss (Arnold et al., 2007), vanishes with an exponential rate. For the copula approach, (Liu et al., 2009) show that when copula-based model is the true model, the copula-based structure learning algorithm with non-parametric estimation of marginals converges to\nthe true graph with a rate of O (\u221a\nlog(n) n1\u2212\u03be\n) for some\n\u03be \u2208 (0, 1), which is far slower than the exponential convergence of Lasso-Granger. The performance of transfer entropy heavily relies on the accuracy of entropy estimations, which require a large number of observations, especially for high dimensional distributions, to achieve robust estimation (Beirlant et al., 1997). For example, the Nearest Neighbor Estimator converges with root-n rate, which is again far slower\nthan the convergence rate of Lasso-Granger. However, Sparse-GEV inherits the variable selection advantages of Lasso-Granger while allows a more flexible marginal distribution for the observations. It is fully parametric, and together with proper `1 penalization can avoid over-fitting while capturing non-linear dependencies."}, {"heading": "4.

For evaluation, we use the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score, i.e., the probability that the algorithm will assign a higher value to a randomly chosen positive (existing) edge than a randomly chosen negative (nonexisting) edge in the graph. In the prediction task, we conduct experiments via the sliding window approach: given time series observations of length T and a window size S, we train a model on observations of xs, . . . , xT\u2212S+s\u22121 and test it on the (T \u2212 S + s)th sample, for s = 1, . . . , S.

From Fig. 3(a), we can see that the temporal dependence between different buzz are sparse (since they are quite different topics); however, the buzz on \u201cHaiti Earthquake\u201d generates a huge impact on the whole Twitter universe and significantly changes the future mentions of other popular meme phrases. An interesting observation in Fig. 3(b) is that the hashtag on the general theme #OWS has direct temporal dependence with the city-specific hashtags, such as #O-LA and #O-DC, while city-specific hashtags do not affect each other.\nPrediction Performance As discussed in Section 2, Sparse-GEV can also be used for predicting future extreme events. For other baseline methods, we use the approaches discussed in Section 3.1 for predictions. Table 2 shows the prediction accuracy of different algorithms on all datasets. As we can see, SparseGEV outperforms all the other algorithms across all datasets. This can be attributed to two properties of Sparse-GEV: its flexibility in modeling complex distributions and its effectiveness in utilizing the samples. The assumptions of Lasso-Granger and copula methods about the distribution of the data can be responsible for their lower performance.

Parameter Sensitivity Assessment", "text": "Like other latent state models, Sparse-GEV model has many parameters, which could affect its performance significantly. In our last experiment, we assess the parameter sensitivity. Fig. 4(a) shows that in a large range of values for the regularization parameter \u03bb, the graph learning accuracy remains unchanged and little effort in selection of the regularization parameter leads to the optimal performance. Fig. 4(b) suggests that in less than 10 EM iterations, our algorithm converges to the optimal point. Fig. 4(c) illustrates the effect of \u03c4 on the performance of Sparse-GEV. Small values of \u03c4 result in smoother estimation of E[\u00b5|X], while higher values lead to sensitive estimation (as a result E[\u00b5|X] closely follows the observation time series). This observation suggests that we should monitor the sample mean of the latent variables and choose a value of \u03c4 that allows smooth latent variables to capture the trend of observations."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we propose sparse-GEV, a sparse latent space model, to uncover the sparse temporal de-\npendency from multivariate extreme value time series. To estimate the parameters of the model, we develop an iterative searching algorithm based on the generalized EM-algorithm and sampling with particle filtering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Sparse-GEV outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms such as copula and transfer entropy. For future work, we are interested in the theoretical analysis on the consistency of the Sparse-GEV model."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "We thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.
