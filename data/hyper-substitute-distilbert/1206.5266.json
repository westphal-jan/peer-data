We present here a novel data structure for compiling weighted graphical models (in particular, probabilistic models), called AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagram (AOMDD). This is a generalization of our previous work on constraint networks, to weighted models. The AOMDD is based on the frameworks of AND/OR search spaces for graphical models, and Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDD). The AOMDD is a canonical representation of a graphical model, and its size and compilation time are bounded exponentially by the treewidth of the graph, rather than pathwidth as is known for OBDDs. We discuss a Variable Elimination schedule for compilation, and present the general APPLY algorithm that combines two weighted AOMDDs, and also present a search based method for compilation method. The preliminary experimental evaluation is quite encouraging, showing the potential of the AOMDD data structure.", "creator": "Adobe InDesign CS2 (4.0.4)"}}}
