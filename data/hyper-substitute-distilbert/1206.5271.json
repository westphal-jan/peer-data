They are unable to learn relationships that exhibit \u201ccorrelation-immunity\u201d, such as parity. To learn Bayesian networks in the presence of correlation-immune relationships, we extend the Sparse Candidate algorithm with a technique called \u201cskewing\u201d. This technique uses the observation that relationships that are correlation-immune under a speci \u0304c input distribution may not be correlation-immune under another, su\u00b1ciently di\u00aeerent distribution.
