Traditionally, the variables of a BN are assumed to be either discrete or continuous. In recent years BNs with a mixture of continuous and discrete variables have received an increasing level of attention. Here exact belief update in CLG BNs is considered.\nExtending the class of BNs containing discrete (or continuous) variables only to the class of BNs containing both discrete and continuous variables is not simple. The work by Pearl [12] on BNs containing continuous variables imposed three constraints on the variables in the network. The interaction between variables is linear, the sources of uncertainty are Gaussian distributed and uncorrelated, and the causal network is singly connected. Later, Shachter & Kenley [14] described how to solve Gaussian influence diagrams\nunder similar constraints, but allowing multiple connected causal networks.\nLauritzen [5] presents a scheme for modeling and exact belief update in CLG BNs. This scheme is more general than the scheme proposed by Pearl. The conditional distribution of the continuous variables given the discrete variables is assumed to be multivariate Gaussian. Only continuous variables which are linear additively Gaussian distributed are considered. The asymmetry between continuous and discrete variables induces a number of constraints on the model specification and the inference structure. Using a similar approach Chang & Fung [1] extend the SPI algorithm [13] to solve arbitrary queries against CLG BNs.\nThe Lauritzen [5] architecture is known to suffer from problems causing numerical instability. For this reason the architecture was later revised by Lauritzen & Jensen [6] in order to improve the numerical stability of belief update. Recently, Cowell [2] introduced an alternative architecture for belief update based on message passing in an elimination tree using the arcreversal operation of Shachter & Kenley [14] (referred to as the EXCHANGE operation). By performing message passing in an elimination tree the need for complex matrix operations is eliminated.\nWe introduce a new architecture for belief update in CLG BNs. The architecture is an extension of lazy propagation [10] based on operations introduced by Lauritzen & Jensen [6] and Cowell [2]. Belief update proceeds by message passing in a strong junction tree structure where messages are computed using arc-reversal and EXCHANGE operations. The EXCHANGE operation is extended to eliminate discrete variables by arc-reversal. Variables are eliminated using a sequence of EXCHANGE operations and barren variable removals. Posterior marginal distributions are computed using EXCHANGE and PUSH [6] operations.\nWe investigate the computational efficiency of the proposed architecture by comparing its performance on a\nnumber of randomly generated CLG BNs with the performance of the Lauritzen & Jensen [6] architecture as implemented in the HUGIN Decision Engine, i.e., the inference engine of the HUGIN tools. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of various steps of belief update such as computing posterior distributions."}, {"heading": "2 PRELIMINARIES AND NOTATION", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 CLG BAYESIAN NETWORK", "text": "A CLG BN N = (X,G,P,F) over variables X consists of an acyclic, directed graph (DAG) G = (V, E), a set of conditional probability distributions P = {P(X| \u03c0(X)) : X \u2208 \u2206}, and a set of CLG density functions F = {f(Y | \u03c0(Y)) : Y \u2208 \u0393 } where \u2206 is the set of discrete variables and \u0393 is the set of continuous variables such that X = \u2206 \u222a \u0393 .

Hence, in the case of a larger number of variables (and same structure), the storage and time reduction can be significant."}, {"heading": "4 COMPARISON", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 COWELL", "text": "Cowell [2] presents an algorithm for belief update where message passing proceeds on an elimination tree rather than a (strong) junction tree. This produces a local propagation scheme in which all calculations involving continuous variables are performed by manipulating univariate regressions (avoiding matrix operations) such that continuous variables are eliminated using EXCHANGE operations.\nThe three main differences between the present propagation scheme and Cowell [2] are: use of a strong junction tree as opposed to an elimination tree, use of EXCHANGE to eliminate both continuous and discrete variables and a single round of message passing."}, {"heading": "4.2 LAURITZEN AND JENSEN", "text": "The architecture of Lauritzen & Jensen [6] performs belief update by message passing in a strong junction tree architecture. A CG potential [8] is associated with each clique and separator. A CG potential consists of a probability potential over discrete variables and a probability density function over continuous variables conditional on the discrete variables. Each clique and\nseparator has a CG potential over its variables. This implies that complex matrix operations are required during belief update.\nInitialization plays an important role in the Lauritzen & Jensen [6] architecture. It produces a Lauritzen & Spiegelhalter-like junction tree representation [7] where clique potentials are conditioned on the continuous variables of the parent separator. This ensures that a variable Y \u2208 \u0393 is only propagated when inserting evidence on Y or when computing the mixture marginal for Y. Furthermore, a complex recursive combination operator may be required during initialization in order to combine CG potentials. The need for conditioning, recursive combination, and complex matrix operations is eliminated in both the Cowell [2] and the present architectures.\nExample 4.1 Figure 5 shows a CLG BN and its junction tree T. The initial clique potentials are:\n\u03c0C1 = ({P(X1)}, {f(Y1 |X1), f(Y3 |X1, Y1, Y2)}), \u03c0C2 = (\u2205, {f(Y2 |Y1, Y4), f(Y4)}).\nIn the Lauritzen & Jensen [6] architecture initialization of T requires a recursive combination operation.\nIn the proposed architecture initialization amounts to associating probability distributions and densities with cliques of T. The prior distribution of each variable is readily computed using the EXCHANGE operation.\nThe Lauritzen & Jensen [6] architecture calculates weak marginals during DISTRIBUTE. This is not the case for the Cowell [2] nor the present architecture."}, {"heading": "4.3 MADSEN", "text": "The present architecture is quite different from the architecture proposed by Madsen [9]. The latter architecture is an extension of Madsen & Jensen [11] to the case of CLG BNs based on the propagation scheme of Lauritzen & Jensen [6]. This implies a number of differences when compared to the present scheme. First, the architecture is based solely on the operations of Lauritzen & Jensen [6] whereas the present scheme is based on operations of both Lauritzen & Jensen [6]\nand Cowell [2]. Second, a Lauritzen & Spiegelhalterlike junction tree representation is achieved as the result of initialization, i.e., during the initial COLLECT operation, the sender clique is conditioned on the continuous variables of the parent separator. Finally, in the present scheme variable eliminations are performed using EXCHANGE operations and barren variable removals."}, {"heading": "5 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS", "text": "A preliminary performance analysis on a set of randomly generated CLG BNs has been made. Networks with 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 variables with different fractions of continuous variables (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) were randomly generated (ten networks of each size). For each network, evidence sets of 0 to 20 instantiated variables were generated and 40 sets of evidence were generated for each size.\nWe compared the performance of the present architecture with the performance of the commercial implementation of the Lauritzen & Jensen [6] architecture in the HUGIN Decision Engine. Table 1 shows statis-\ntics on one of the networks used in the tests (net50-4) where s(C) = \u220f X\u2208\u2206\u2229C \u2016X\u2016 and s(C) = \u2211 C\u2208C s(C). Figure 6 shows the average time cost of belief update in net50-4 whereas Figure 7 shows the average size of the largest discrete configuration. A discrete configuration is either the domain of a factor or the discrete conditioning set of a density. This is an example where the proposed architecture is most efficient.\nThe present architecture maintains a factorization of clique and separator potentials into sets of factors and densities. This decomposition implies that the largest discrete domain size considered during belief update is often significantly smaller than the discrete domain size of the largest clique in the strong junction tree. This insight is supported by the experimental analysis, which indicates that the Lauritzen & Jensen [6] implementation runs out of memory on most networks with 75 or more variables for a large fraction of the evidence sets whereas the present architecture runs out of memory on a much smaller fraction of the evidence\nsets. Figure 7 illustrates how the average largest discrete domain size decreases as |\u01eb| increases. Notice that the average largest size is significantly smaller than the size of the largest clique in the strong junction tree.\nFor networks with only discrete or only continuous variables the Lauritzen & Jensen implementation is faster than the implementation of the proposed architecture. However, for some networks with a fraction of 0.25 or 0.5 continuous variables Lauritzen & Jensen is significantly slower than the proposed architecture.\nThe typical decrease in average time cost as |\u01eb| increases for lazy propagation is not as significant on CLG BNs. The reason is that computing marginal densities is a dominant and a non-constant factor in the time cost of belief update. A significant amount of the total time for propagating evidence is spent on computing posterior mixture marginals. In the proposed architecture the number and the computational cost\nof PUSH operations is reduced by a decomposition of clique and separator potentials. The significance of the decrease depends on the ratio of continuous variables. Figure 8 shows the average time cost of computing marginals in net50-4. Notice that a significant amount of the time cost originates from computing marginals.\nOn most of the networks considered in the test \u2014 where belief update is feasible \u2014 the commercial implementation of Lauritzen & Jensen [6] is most efficient (typically networks with less than 75 variables). The HUGIN Decision Engine has significantly more efficient data structures and operations than the implementation of the proposed architecture though.\nThe experiments were performed using a Java implementation on a desktop computer with a 2.2 GHz AMD AthlonTM CPU and 768 MB RAM running Redhat 8."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "An architecture for belief update in CLG BNs based on lazy propagation where messages are computed using EXCHANGE operations and barren variable eliminations has been presented. The architecture is based on extended versions of operations introduced by Lauritzen & Jensen [6] and Cowell [2].\nDespite a significant difference in the efficiency of table operations the proposed architecture is \u2014 in some cases \u2014 more efficient than a commercial implementation of the Lauritzen & Jensen [6] architecture.
