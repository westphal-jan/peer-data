The network de\u00ad composes a utility function into a number of additive factors, with the directionality of the arcs reflecting conditional dependence in the underlying (qualitative) preference ordering under a ceteris paribus interpreta\u00ad tion. The CP-semantics ensures that computing opti\u00ad mization and dominance queries is very efficient. We also demonstrate the value of this representation in de\u00ad cision making.
