Loopy belief propa\u00ad gation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expec\u00ad tation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and variance, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be convincingly better than methods with simi\u00ad lar computational cost: Laplace's method, vari\u00ad ational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
