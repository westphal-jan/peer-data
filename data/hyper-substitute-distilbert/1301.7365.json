It is shown that uncer tainty issues are linked both to the models and to the matching algorithm. Three different types of uncertainties are identified, and within each one, the numerical and the symbolic cases are distin guished. The emphasis is then put on purely sym bolic uncertainties: it is shown that they can be dealt with within a purely symbolic framework resulting from a transposition of classical nume rical estimation tools.\n1 SITUATION ASSESSMENT PROBLEM\nLet us consider the generic problem that is dealt with in the PERCEPTION project1 [BCF+98], [CCMT97): a sym bolic representation of what is going on in an observed environment has to be built and updated, for applications such as surveillance, intelligence, or decision-aid systems, and autonomous systems. The environment includes mo bile entities and is observed via various sensors (black and white, color and infrared cameras, radars). Numerical pro cessings take sensor data as inputs and deliver recognized and tracked objects with symbolic properties (e.g. the type of the objects: pedestrian, vehicle ... ) and numerical attribu tes (position, speed ... ) The symbolic level interprets these objects in terms of on-going and future activities (e.g. the pedestrian is going to take his car and leave the parking lot), so that the decision level (e.g. a human decision maker) should be informed with semantically rich data and that further relevant actions should be undertaken.\nHuman observers may also be involved as \"sensors\", and their reports are direct inputs for the symbolic level.\n1 http://www.cert.fr/fr/dcsd/PUB/PERCEPTION/\n2 PRINCIPLES\nThe set of the current activities is assessed by the symbolic level thanks to plan prototypes based on the expected properties and attributes of the objects and on the expected variations of the properties and attributes with time. Three basic notions are used: \u2022 a condition prototype is an expected property a priori qualifying the objects that are likely to be observed. Condition prototypes are expressed by atomic formulas built from predefined predicates, e.g. (type x pedestrian), (speed x 4kmlh), (getting-closer x y) with x andy being variables; \u2022 an activity prototype is a set of expected conditions and constraints a priori qualifying the objects that are likely to be observed. Activity prototypes are represented by constrained cubes [TGLP88], i.e. conjunctions of atomic formulas associated with constraints, in which all the variables are assumed to be existentially quantified [CCMT97]. Ex: {(type x pedestrian), (type y vehicle) , (speed y v) {v = 0}, (getting-closer-tox y)}, withx, y and v being variables. \u2022 a plan prototype is a temporal graph of activity proto types; it is represented by an interpreted Petri net [DA91] whose places are associated with activity prototypes. Ex:\nLet P be the set of plan prototypes.\n62 Castel, Cossart, and Tessier\nAn observation obsn is a set of properties directly issued by the numerical processing, resulting from a numerical symbolic translation, or issued by a human observer at time tn. The current situation Sn at time tn is a set of plans (Pi,m,,n), defined as marked elements Pi of P; the mar king mi of a plan prototype Pi at time tn corresponds to the fact that some properties in obsn match the interpreta tion of some places (activity prototypes) in Pi. Given obsn+l and Sn, the elaboration of the current situ ation Sn+l at time tn+l is a prediction-verification process which is based on the following principles: i) a greater importance is given to the continuation of existing plans; ii) all the objects appearing in properties within obsn have to be explained, i.e. to belong to at least one plan; iii) the prediction of situation Sn+l from situ ation Sn is the set of the reachable markings mi + k of plans (Pi,m;,n); iv) the verification consists in matching the properties of obsn+l with those reachable markings; if some properties remain unmatched this way, new plans (Pj,mj,n+l) are created. As a given object may be associated with several plans, Sn+l represents the different hypothetic plans that are likely to be in progress in the observed environment.\n3 UNCERTAINTY ISSUES\nWhatever the situations are built for (immediate or delayed warnings or actions, information collecting in an intelli gence context, detection of specific activities ... ), the situ ation assessment process has to deliver appropriate results, which means that [KSH91]: \u2022 results (assessed situations) have to agree with the global mission goal: a potentially hazardous situation has to be reported early, even if the assessment is not complete or certain; all the situations that are significant for the mission must be expected and recognized. \u2022 results have to be accurate, i.e. situations must not in clude a high number of different plan hypotheses. There fore, activity and plan prototypes, as well as the matching algorithm, have to be discriminating enough (a plan proto type that would model that anything can happen is of minor interest). \u2022 results have to be computed efficiently, without too nu merous or too complicated models.\nLet us now analyze the situation assessment process from the uncertainty point of view.\n3.1 UNCERTAINTY AND THE MODELS\nThe whole situation assessment process is a series of trans formations from sensor data into high level symbolic pro perties.\n3.1.1 Conditions\nConditions are the first link between sensor data and the symbolic level. They include:\n- numerical attributes, such as the position in the environ ment, or the speed, of a tracked object; - classification results, such as the type of the objects (e.g. an object is classified as a pedestrian or a vehicle); - elementary actions that may result from a numerical symbolic translation (e.g. getting-closer-to, close-to). The accuracy of the numerical attributes depends on the nu merical processings and is only a matter of numerical pre cision. On the other hand, classes and elementary actions have to be a priori defined, and the accuracy of the defini tion has direct consequences on object matching: a com promise has to be found between too strict and too loose definitions. For example, condition getting-closer-to will hold for a pedestrian P 1 moving towards a parked vehicle VI if Pl 's speed vector belongs to a given cone (see figure).\nThis kind of definition allows the dispersion of natural be haviours and the imprecision on the numerical measure ments to be taken into account. Nevertheless, there is a threshold effect (the condition holds if P 1 is within the cone and does not hold even if he is close to it). Furthermore, a unique definition may not be suited to a real environment in so far as actual behaviours for achieving a given goal may be very different from one another, depending on the particular objects at stake and on the environmental context (weather, environment layout...) The second point is that a given condition may include several sub-conditions (this is the case for class conditions that are most of the time defined by several parameters): should all the sub-conditions hold to make the condition hold too? or are there any sub-conditions that are less im portant than the others? what is the difference for condition assessment when a sub-condition\u2022 is mismatched, and when it is not matched at all through lack of information?\n3.1.2 Activities\nThe assessment of an activity, as a set of conditions, re sults from the assessment of the conditions describing it and therefore inherits the corresponding uncertainty issues. Nevertheless further particular issues can be identified. Activities are closely linked to the types of the objects as they are the actors. The uncertainty on types (e.g. an object is close to the pedestrian class, but also to the vehicle class) may result in several exclusive activity hypotheses being created (e.g. pedestrian-moving OR vehicle-moving). An activity may not be fully assessed or distinguished from another one by means of its mere condition set. For ins tance, an empty parked vehicle cannot be distinguished\nfrom a parked vehicle with a driver inside: what can be told is that there is a parked vehicle. A refinement can be made thanks to the current plan hypotheses and the history of the observations: if one of these hypotheses is vehicle departure plan and a pedestrian just disappeared near the vehicle involved, activity parked-occupied-vehicle is most likely to hold. Finally, the same questions as before are raised: should all the conditions hold to make the activity hold too? or are there any conditions that are less important than the others? what is the difference for activity assessment when a condition is mismatched, and when it is not matched at all through lack of information?\n3.1.3 Plans\nThe assessment of a plan, as a temporal sequence of activi ties, results from the assessment of the activities and there fore inherits the corresponding uncertainty issues. A par ticular problem that arises when considering \"free\" envi ronments, where no predefined procedure is available, is the assessment of the temporal sequence of the activities: does the set of the assessed activities match the temporal sequence described in the prototype? are other sequences acceptable? what to do with extra activities?\n3.2 UNCERTAINTY AND MATCHING\nAs an explanation is required for each observed object, a given object has to be matched to one activity within one plan. What happens as a result of the prediction - verifica tion process is that this object may be matched to several activities and plans, and conversely, a given plan may be associated to several different objects. The questions that are raised are the following: should all the matchings be kept or not? should the plan hypotheses with no new cor responding observations be kept and for how long, given that there may be objects that are occulted or not observa ble? are there hypotheses that are more relevant than the others, considering the mission?\n4 CLASSIFICATION OF\nUNCERTAINTIES\nThe previous analysis results in a classification of the un certainties within the situation assessment problem. Three main types of uncertainties may be identified: matching un certainties, conjunction uncertainties, and disjunction un certainties.\n4.1 MATCHING UNCERTAINTIES\nMatching uncertainties are linked to the data-to-model matching problem: data coming from sensors or issued by numerical processings have to be matched with pre defined models corresponding to higher semantic levels, e.g. the pedestrian type, the getting-closer-to condition,\nSymbolic Uncertainty in Situation Assessment 63\nthe vehicle-moving activity, or the vehicle-departure plan. As stated before, data hardly perfectly match predefined models, and impeifect matchings have to be considered. Nevertheless, two different cases have to be distinguished: \u2022 a first case is numerical imperfect matching, which in volves parameters that take their values in continuous do mains, where distances can be defined. Ex: (i) the position or speed associated to an object is im precise, depending on the sensor data or the numerical al gorithms. A traditional approach for the estimation of such parame ters is Kalman filtering [MM93], which allows the state (i.e. the set of the parameters such as position and speed) of a dynamic system to be predicted and updated by new measurements, on the basis of a quadratic error criterion. Noise effects coming from both measurements and model ling are taken into account. It is widely used in object dy namic tracking (e.g. [JKC97]).\n(ii) condition getting-closer-to is more or less satisfied, de pending on the position of the pedestrian with respect to the cone (see figure 2). This is classically dealt with thanks to probabilistic or pos sibilistic approaches, depending on the available know ledge. For example, Herzog, in the V ITRA project [Her95], uses a measure of degrees of applicability that ex presses the extent to which a spatial relation is applicable. Every relevant geometric factor (relative distance, angular deviation from a given canonical direction ... ) is mapped onto interval [0, 1] by means of cubic spline functions as sociated with different qualitative notions (such as the con tiguity or the proximity for the relative distance). The de gree may depend on different spline values, e.g. the degree of relation right of is a combination of the direction and proximity factors. In a traffic context, [FHKN96] use predicates to describe the (relative) motion of one (or two) objects. Primitives such as fast(X, t), equal-orientation(X, Y, t), which can be directly derived from the speed and orientation attributes estimated by the tracking process, are modelled by means of fuzzy sets.\n\u2022 a second case is symbolic imperfect matching, which in volves symbolic items, i.e. discrete frames, within which no distance can be defined. Ex: (i) property (type VI, car) imperfectly matches proto type condition (type y, bus); (ii) so does property (type VI, car) with prototype condition (type x, pedestrian). Hints to deal with such imperfect matchings will be given in the sequel. It is worth noticing however that many symbolic items are simply abstractions of numerical features, especially when data only come from physical sensors: an object VI is la belled as a car because the values of the numerical para meters of the corresponding shape in the images (e.g. sur face, position of the center of gravity, elongation, rotundi ty ... ) match the reference values of class car. Therefore, a numerical distance between e.g. a car and a bus or a pedes trian can be soundly defined as an aggregation of the res-\n64 Castel, Cossart, and Tessier\npective distances between each parameter, thus allowing a matching quality coefficient to be defined. This projection onto a numerical space may also be propagated to the up per symbolic levels provided all the items involved have numerical bases. For example, in the static scene inter pretation system described in [LLMC96], each object type is characterized by different attributes (geometric attribute, aspect attribute ... ) The validation of the object hypotheses is based on the assessment of a global confidence degree for each object type. This global degree is a combination of the confidence degrees of the different attributes, which are directly computed from numerical characteristics of the detected shapes in the images.\nPurely symbolic items do not have any numerical bases and therefore cannot be projected onto any numerical space without adding any supplementary knowledge, as weights, preferences, etc. Examples of such symbolic items are data coming from human observers, and condition, activity and plan prototypes.\n4.2 CONJUNCTION UNCERTAINTIES\nConjunction uncertainties arise when several sub conditions, conditions or activities have to hold to make a condition, activity or plan respectively hold.\n\u2022 In the case where numerical matching quality coefficients can be defined for each component of the item to be as sessed, a common approach is to aggregate them, following given rules that most often depend on external knowledge. In [DP95], Dubois and Prade extend the basic principles of fuzzy pattern matching (characterized by data which can be pervaded by imprecision and uncertainty, and re quirements which may be fuzzy) to situations where dif ferent subparts of a pattern have various levels of impor tance. They develop the case where the importance weight becomes a function of the concerned attribute value. In [BL96] it is noticed that, with classical likelihood aggrega tion rules such as min/max in the possibility theory, the matching quality decreases as the description is more de tailed, because of the imperfect matching of individual de tails. Therefore the concept of description redundancy is defined, which allows the matching likelihood to be as sessed by selecting a limited number of description items. A method is described to assess how many items, and which ones, may be dropped.\n\u2022 In the other cases, there is no means to quantify to what extent the set of components matches the item. Ex: (i) let {(type y vehicle), (speed y J5kmlh)} be a two-condition activity prototype. This activity holds if there exist an object y assessed as a vehicle with a 15kmlh speed. Let us suppose that the lower level (or a human observer) issues the following data: {(speed OJ JOkm/h), (close-to OJ building)}, which means that an object OJ with a speed of lOkmlh was detected near the building. To what extent does this observation match the activity prototype? \"0.5'', as only one predicate can be matched\nout of two? or more, as JOkmlh is quite close to J5kmlh? how is it possible to quantify the missing condition (type y vehicle) and the additional one (close-to 0 J building)? (ii) to what extent does activity sequence (pedestrian moving-towards-vehicle, pedestrian-stopped, pedestrian moving-towards-vehicle, pedestrian-getting-into-vehicle, vehicle-moving-towards-exit) match plan prototype vehicle-departure? Hints to deal with such symbolic conjunction uncertainties will be given in the sequel.\n4.3 DISJUNCTION UNCERTAINTIES\nWithin the prediction - verification process, a set of dis junctive hypotheses of conditions, activities or plans is cre ated each time several matchings are possible between data and models: therefore, hypothesis disjunction uncertainties are a consequence of matching and conjunction uncertain ties described above.\n\u2022 In the case where numerical matching quality coeffi cients can be associated to conditions and activities, and likelihood coefficients can be associated to the transitions between activity prototypes within plan prototypes, each disjunction element can be qualified by a global coefficient resulting from the aggregation of the different matching quality and likelihood coefficients. If pruning is necessary, a preference function based on these global coefficients or on external knowledge can be defined. For example, [HB93] propose a task-driven approach to the surveillance problem in traffic, characterized by a selective attention. A dynamic form of Bayesian network is used to capture the changing relationships between scene objects: given a task (e.g. attend to likely overtaking and ignore likely fol lowing), it provides measures of which pairs of objects are worth further attention. Then a dedicated tasknet is used to identify the likelihood of the wanted task (e.g. over taking), of the related but unwanted tasks( e.g. following, queueing), and of the default unknown task. Tasknets are static Bayesian networks, with a priori conditional proba bilities that reflect a preferential bias towards a feature that is deemed to be most interesting.\n\u2022 In other cases, there is no means to quantify to what extent a plan hypothesis is better than another one, except with external knowledge based criteria, such as mission depen dent preferences. In [CG91], a system for story understan ding is described in which Bayesian networks are dynami cally constructed in order to evaluate the conditional proba bilities of competing plan hypotheses given the evidence. The prior probability of each hypothesis is computed un der the assumption of a large but finite domain of equipro bable elements: the probability is linked with the number of instances of the plan. [Bau94] presents a framework based on Dempster-Shafer's theory for assessing and se lecting plan hypotheses that takes into account disjunctive and uncertain observations as well as agents' preferences. Agent-specific preferences are encoded as basic probability assignments. A total ordering of the hypotheses can be ob-\ntained by collapsing the belief intervals computed for each hypothesis into a pignistic probability.\n5 SYMBOLIC UNCERTAINTIES\nIn this section, we particularly focus on purely symbolic items for which no intrinsic numerical basis is available. Symbolic data may be projected onto numerical spaces as, in some cases, predefined likelihood or preference measu res encode notions such as sensor reliability, information quantity or matching satisfaction. But, as it is a matter of context, no universal method is available [DP94]. What is aimed at is to show that, within the situation assessment framework, some notions widely used in continuous con texts can be transposed within discrete ones.\n5.1 AN ESTIMATION PROBLEM\nThe prediction - verification principle explained in sec tion 2 shows that the predicted state of the observed en vironment (i.e. the activities to come) is computed from previous information and models (plan prototypes), and re vised with new information, within a dynamic process: it is the same principle as numerical estimation. Therefore, dy namic situation assessment, at the activity and plan levels, is a symbolic estimation problem.\nExisting estimation techniques are numerical techniques: they aim at assessing deterministic or random magnitudes from observations tainted with stochastic errors. Kalman filtering, already mentioned in section 4.1, is one of these techniques. As our problem is to estimate the situation in a dynamic environment from uncertain reference models on the one hand and uncertain data on the other, the idea is to reconsider the symbolic layers of situation assessment in the light of numerical estimation techniques. The basic notions of Kalman filtering are especially investigated, and adapted to the symbolic context of situation assessment.\n5.2 FROM KALMAN FILTERING TO SYMBOLIC ESTIMATION\nKalman filtering addresses dynamic systems whose state equation involves a matrix representing how the state varies with time, a deterministic input, and a random noise, the state noise, modifying the deterministic evolution of the state. The observation equation links the current observa tion to the current state via a second matrix and a second type of random noise, the observation noise. Prediction of the state estimate at time tn+l is accom plished from the state estimate at time tn, so is the pre dicted observation at time tn+l\u00b7 The covariance matrix of the state estimation error is also computed. The second step consists in comparing the observation at time tn+l with the prediction, and consequently to revise the state estimate. This revision depends on the prediction errors and on the noises.\nSymbolic Uncertainty in Situation Assessment 65\nThe notions and principles of Kalman filtering are now go ing to be transposed into the symbolic world.\n5.2.1 Symbolic state\nIn Kalman filtering, the state is assumed to be a gaussian variable characterized by a mean and a covariance. This can be transposed through the notions of kernel plan and kernel activity, and plan and activity tolerance, thus rede fining the plan and activity prototypes.\nDefinition 1 a plan prototype Pi is a pair (KPi, T(Pi)). The kernel plan K Pi is a minimum sequence of activity prototypes that has to be necessarily matched by a sequence of observations in order to interpret them as an instance of Pi. The plan tolerance T(Pi) is a dispersion around K Pi: it is a set of supplementary activity prototypes that will possibly be matched by the observed sequence. Let P be the set of plan prototypes.\nPlan tolerance may include pedestrian-stopped and vehicle-moving-off activity prototypes.\nDefinition 2 an activity prototype Aij within a plan pro totype Pi is a pair (KAiJ>T(Aij)). The kernel activity K Aij is a minimum set of conditions and constraints that have to be necessarily matched by an observation in order to assess it as an instance of Aij. The activity tolerance T(Aij) is a dispersion around KAij.\" it includes both nu merical dispersions around conditions and constraints of K Aij, and supplementary conditions and constraints, that will possibly be matched by the observed activity.\nEx: kernel activity of moving-vehicle activity prototype is ((type y vehicle) (speed y v)}; activity tolerance may in clude (v 2: 30kmlh} constraint or (speed y 25kmlh) condi tion (numerical dispersion), and supplementary symbolic conditions such as (make y Renault), (moving-backwards y).\nDefinition 3 the current state Sn at time tn is a set of marked plan prototypes of P, i.e. a set of plans (KPi,mi,n,T(Pi,mi,n)). For each plan, KPi,mi,n is the Petri net associated to kernel plan K Pi and marked with marking mi at time tn; T(Pi,mi,n) is the set of supple mentary activities belonging to T(Pi) that hold at time tn.\nMarking mi corresponds to a subset of activity prototypes, i.e. pairs (KAij,mi,n,T(Aij,mi,n)): it means that each K Aij,mi ,n holds at time tn and that some conditions of T(Aij) also hold. It is the same for supplementary activit ies within T(Pi,mi,n)\u00b7 The equation of evolution for state Sn is given by the Petri net based plan prototypes, since they represent the tem poral linkings of the activities. The inputs are events as sociated to the transitions of the Petri nets (e.g. event (type x pedestrian) meaning that a pedestrian is appearing, thus modifying the symbolic state of the system).\nThe main difference with the numerical case is that the pre diction temporal horizon is finite for one state, since plan prototypes involve finite sequences of activities.\n5.2.2 Symbolic observations\nLet us assume that only purely symbolic observations are available, i.e. data coming from human observers or not assessed with numerical criteria.\nDefinition 4 as for the numerical case, the observation equation is a projection of the current state onto the set of actually observable activities. This projection depends on observation conditions (environment layout, observa tion means).\n5.2.3 Noises\nAs for the numerical case, two different kinds of noises can be distinguished: state noise and observation noise, res pectively modifying the state and observation equations.\nDefinition 5 a state noise is a deviation of a plan from the plan prototype, resulting from unexpected events created by objects that do not belong to that plan prototype.\nEx: (i) a dog may cross the road just ahead of a car leaving the parking-lot; this car has to brake suddenly, thus modify ing plan vehicle-departure; (ii) two independent plans may interact: the vehicle-departure car may have to brake be cause of a vehicle-arrival parking car.\nDefinition 6 an observation noise is a deviation of the ac tual observation from what should be observed given the current state.\nEx: (i) dysfunctions within the observation means, or a bad weather, may alter the observations; (ii) objects that have nothing to do with the on-going plans are observa tion noises for these plans, e.g.: a dog wandering on the parking-lot; objects belonging to several independent and non-interacting plans are observation noises for one ano ther; moreover, these objects may create unexpected oc cultations.\nRemark: observation noise does not modify the current state as it is just a matter of perception conditions, whereas state noise does. It is worth noticing however that an obser vation noise may become a state noise, e.g. the wandering dog may cause the vehicle-departure car to brake suddenly. In that sense, both kinds of noises can be correlated, as it may be the case in Kalman filtering.\n5.3 DYNAMIC ASPECTS\n5.3.1 One-step prediction\nDefinition 7 let Sn+lln be the one-step predicted situ ation from Sn. Sn+lln is the set of the reachable markings mi + k, k E {0, 1} of plans (KPi,mi,n' T(Pi,mi,n)): it is a disjunction of activity prototype subsets {(KAij, mi+k, n+lln\u2022 T(Aij, mi+k, n+lln))}, k E {0, 1}.\nEx: let us assume that situation Sn corresponds to activ ity subset {pedestrian-moving-towards-vehicle, parked vehicle} within plan vehicle-departure. Sn+lln is the disjunction {pedestrian-moving-towards-vehicle, parked vehicle} OR {pedestrian-getting-into-vehicle, parked vehicle}.\nRemark: T(Aij, mi+l, n+lln) is the expected dispersion around the predicted activities associated with marking mi + 1; it is composed of propagated matched conditions ofT(Aij, mi, n)\u00b7 Ex: if (make y Renault) is a supplementary condition of activities pedestrian-moving-towards-vehicle and parked vehicle, it is propagated by the prediction process and associated to the disjunction {pedestrian-moving-towards vehicle, parked vehicle} OR {pedestrian-getting-into vehicle, parked-vehicle}\n5.3.2 Revision\nA main notion in Kalman filtering is innovation, which re presents the observation prediction error, i.e. the difference between predicted and actual observations. Innovation is the basis for state estimate revision. In the same way, the notion of symbolic innovation can be defined.\nDefinition 9 the symbolic innovation In+l results from the matching of observation obsn+l delivered at time tn+l with predicted observation obsn+lln\u00b7 Revised state Sn+lln+l\u2022 denoted Sn+b is a function of In+l\u00b7\nTwo cases have to be distinguished: \u2022 obsn+l matches obsn+lln (i.e. one subset of observable activity prototypes within the predicted disjunction); what is observed instantiates what is expected, therefore, state estimate Sn+l is within prediction Sn+lln\u2022 there is no in novation. Ex: if obsn+lln is {(type PI pedestrian), (speed PI v)} (predicted kernel activity) with tolerance {v ::; 8kmlh} within a pedestrian-moving plan, and obsn+l is { (type PI pedestrian), (speed PI 5 kmlh)}: obsn+l is more precise than obsn+lln because of the speed value. This numerical dispersion is included within the predicted activity tole rance.\n\u2022 obsn+l does not match obsn+lJn\u00b7 An impeifect mat ching, characterizing the common features of obsn+l and obsn+lln is then considered. Let infn+l be the result of this imperfect matching.\n1. if infn+l matches the kernels of one subset of the pre dicted activities and possibly some of the predicted tole rance conditions, innovation In+l is the set of supplemen tary properties contained in obsn+l\u00b7 Revision then depends on these properties: - if they involve objects already known or expected within the current plans, they are integrated as extended tolerances within the current plans. Ex: if obsn+l is now {(type PI pedestrian), (speed PI 5 kmlh), (close-to PI building)}, supplementary property (close-to PI building) concerns object PI and can be in tegrated within plan pedestrian-moving tolerance; or, if a more specific plan prototype exists and includes this pro perty, revision is a switch from the less specific to the more specific plan. - if they involve objects that are unknown and unexpec ted, they are noises for the current plans. Revision consists in instantiating new plan prototypes in P involving these properties. Ex: if obsn+l is now set {(type PI pedestrian), (speed PI 5kmlh), (type VI vehicle), (speed VI 25kmlh)} supplemen tary properties - which are observation noise for the cur rent plan - are associated with a new object V 1. Therefore, activity prototype vehicle-moving within vehicle-arrival\nSymbolic Uncertainty in Situation Assessment 67\nplan prototype can be instantiated. In this case, observation noises may also lead to instanti ate new plan prototypes with fictitious objects. Only an improvement in observation conditions can discard those groundless hypotheses. - a particular case occurs when supplementary properties link already existing and new objects: revision then con sists in matching a more specific plan within P. Ex: let us assume that obsn+l is the previous set with sup plementary property (getting-closer VI P 1). The plan is not pedestrian-moving plan anymore but car-picking-up pedestrian plan.\n2. if infn+ 1 does not match the kernels of any subset of the predicted activities, revision consists in considering other plans within P. Nevertheless, if some properties are com mon to infn+l and to the kernels, they can direct the choice to more relevant plans. Ex: let us assume that obsn+l is now {(speed PI v), (close toP I building)}. infn+l would be (speed PI v ). Therefore, the on-going plan is necessarily an object-moving plan.\nRemarks: - The computation of imperfect matching infn+l has already been studied for conditions expressed as logical cubes (with no constraints) [CCMT97]. It is based on cube anti-unification and reduction. The extension to cons trained cubes is currently under study. - For the time being, there is no a priori links between plan prototypes yet. A graph-based structure of those proto types, with less specific - more specific links is currently being studied, so as a hierarchy of the involved objects.\n6 DISCUSSION\nConsidering the purely symbolic part of situation assess ment as an estimation problem brings several improve ments to the principles set out in section 2.\nThe first point is that purely symbolic uncertainty is dealt with within a symbolic framework, without projecting it onto subjective numerical spaces. It has been shown that notions such as symbolic kernels and tolerances and sym bolic noises could be defined. Hints towards symbolic im perfect matching are also given.\nOne consequence of the estimation approach is that the re sult issued is less combinatorial, since some of the uncer tainties fall within noises or tolerances and no longer create new activities or plans. Moreover, it allows a least com mitment strategy to be followed in so far as least detailed activities and plans are first selected for matching. In the same way, minimum changes are given greater importance at the plan level, just as for numerical estimation algorithms in which the inertia of past events is a basis for prediction. It is worth noticing that this point of view is different from [DDdSCP95]'s for example.\n68 Castel, Cossart, and Tessier\nNevertheless, four important remarks have to be made: \u2022 Disjunction is a powerful tool when several items can no longer be considered within the same model: that is why it is used in Kalman filtering especially in multi-target tracking (multi-model Kalman filtering [BBS88]). Con sequently, the symbolic noises and tolerances that are in troduced do not eliminate disjunctions, but contribute to reduce their drawback, i.e. the combinatorial explosion. \u2022 The previous remark is particularly important when \"noise becomes signal\". For example, let us suppose that plan vehicle-departure is going on in the environment, with current activity being pedestrian-moving-towards-vehicle. Another vehicle entering the parking-lot is state noise for this plan. But if this latter vehicle gets close to the pedes trian and the driver attacks the pedestrian, this is no longer noise, but a mugging plan : models have to be switched. \u2022 The framework that is proposed is a first step towards activity and plan learning in so far as tolerances and noises allow unpredicted items to be intergrated within the mo dels. \u2022 Obviously, situation assessment problems are seldom purely symbolic (or purely numerical). As a matter of fact, a further approach would be to use both quantitative and symbolic handling of uncertainty in the same application [KSH91], i.e. to mix two a priori very different worlds ...\nReferences\n[Bau94] M.

It is shown that uncer\u00ad tainty issues are linked both to the models and to the matching algorithm. Three different types of uncertainties are identified, and within each one, the numerical and the symbolic cases are distin\u00ad guished. The emphasis is then put on purely sym\u00ad bolic uncertainties: it is shown that they can be dealt with within a purely symbolic framework resulting from a transposition of classical nume\u00ad rical estimation tools. 1 SITUATION ASSESSMENT PROBLEM Let us consider the generic problem that is dealt with in the PERCEPTION project1 [BCF+98], [CCMT97): a sym\u00ad bolic representation of what is going on in an observed environment has to be built and updated, for applications such as surveillance, intelligence, or decision-aid systems, and autonomous systems. The environment includes mo\u00ad bile entities and is observed via various sensors (black and white, color and infrared cameras, radars). Numerical pro\u00ad cessings take sensor data as inputs and deliver recognized and tracked objects with symbolic properties (e.g. the type of the objects: pedestrian, vehicle ... ) and numerical attribu\u00ad tes (position, speed ... ) The symbolic level interprets these objects in terms of on-going and future activities (e.g. the pedestrian is going to take his car and leave the parking\u00ad lot), so that the decision level (e.g. a human decision\u00ad maker) should be informed with semantically rich data and that further relevant actions should be undertaken. Human observers may also be involved as \"sensors\", and their reports are direct inputs for the symbolic level. 1 http://www.cert.fr/fr/dcsd/PUB/PERCEPTION/ 2 PRINCIPLES The set of the current activities is assessed by the symbolic level thanks to plan prototypes based on the expected properties and attributes of the objects and on the expected variations of the properties and attributes with time. Three basic notions are used: \u2022 a condition prototype is an expected property a priori qualifying the objects that are likely to be observed. Condition prototypes are expressed by atomic formulas built from predefined predicates, e.g. (type x pedestrian), (speed x 4kmlh), (getting-closer x y) with x andy being variables; \u2022 an activity prototype is a set of expected conditions and constraints a priori qualifying the objects that are likely to be observed. Activity prototypes are represented by constrained cubes [TGLP88], i.e. conjunctions of atomic formulas associated with constraints, in which all the variables are assumed to be existentially quantified [CCMT97]. Ex: {(type x pedestrian), (type y vehicle) , (speed y v) {v = 0}, (getting-closer-tox y)}, withx, y and v being variables. \u2022 a plan prototype is a temporal graph of activity proto\u00ad types; it is represented by an interpreted Petri net [DA91] whose places are associated with activity prototypes. Ex: pedestrian moving towards-vehicle pedestrian gelling into-vehicle parked-occupied-vehicle vehicle moving towards-exit parked-vehicle (typ e y vehicle) (speedyv){v=O) (type y vehicle) (speedy v){v = 0) (type y vehicle) (speedy v){v H) (moving -away-from y parking-lot) (type y vehicle) (speedy v){v H) (getting-closer-to y exit) Figure 1: vehicle-departure plan prototype Let P be the set of plan prototypes. 62 Castel, Cossart, and Tessier An observation obsn is a set of properties directly issued by the numerical processing, resulting from a numerical\u00ad symbolic translation, or issued by a human observer at time tn. The current situation Sn at time tn is a set of plans (Pi,m,,n), defined as marked elements Pi of P; the mar\u00ad king mi of a plan prototype Pi at time tn corresponds to the fact that some properties in obsn match the interpreta\u00ad tion of some places (activity prototypes) in Pi. Given obsn+l and Sn, the elaboration of the current situ\u00ad ation Sn+l at time tn+l is a prediction-verification process which is based on the following principles: i) a greater importance is given to the continuation of existing plans; ii) all the objects appearing in properties within obsn have to be explained, i.e. to belong to at least one plan; iii) the prediction of situation Sn+l from situ\u00ad ation Sn is the set of the reachable markings mi + k of plans (Pi,m;,n); iv) the verification consists in matching the properties of obsn+l with those reachable markings; if some properties remain unmatched this way, new plans (Pj,mj,n+l) are created. As a given object may be associated with several plans, Sn+l represents the different hypothetic plans that are likely to be in progress in the observed environment. 3 UNCERTAINTY ISSUES Whatever the situations are built for (immediate or delayed warnings or actions, information collecting in an intelli\u00ad gence context, detection of specific activities ... ), the situ\u00ad ation assessment process has to deliver appropriate results, which means that [KSH91]: \u2022 results (assessed situations) have to agree with the global mission goal: a potentially hazardous situation has to be reported early, even if the assessment is not complete or certain; all the situations that are significant for the mission must be expected and recognized. \u2022 results have to be accurate, i.e. situations must not in\u00ad clude a high number of different plan hypotheses. There\u00ad fore, activity and plan prototypes, as well as the matching algorithm, have to be discriminating enough (a plan proto\u00ad type that would model that anything can happen is of minor interest). \u2022 results have to be computed efficiently, without too nu\u00ad merous or too complicated models. Let us now analyze the situation assessment process from the uncertainty point of view. 3.1 UNCERTAINTY AND THE MODELS The whole situation assessment process is a series of trans\u00ad formations from sensor data into high level symbolic pro\u00ad perties.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
