Such a system is, for instance the driving situations of a vehicle. The aim is to recognize the phase of a particular manoeuvre at any time by using information coming from the proprioceptive sensors of the vehicle such as accelerometers, steering sensor, and so on. The phase is characterized by a temporal sequence of inputs.\nThe nominal evolution of the system is at priori known and can be modeled (by an expert, for example) , by different methods such as Markof's model or Petri nets. In the first part of this paper, it is proposed to\nContrary to the usual use of the Petri nets, the initial state of the system is unknown. But the sequence of the events on the receptivities gives more and more information, in order to determine the actual state of the system. So a degree of belief is bound to each place, or set of places. The theory used to model this uncertainty is the Dempster-Shafer's, the one which is well adapted to this type of problems. In the second part, this theory applied to the Petri nets is detailed.\nFrom the given Petri net characterizing the nominal evolution of the dynamic system, and from the obser vation inputs, the proposed method allows to deter mine with the great reliability according to the reli ability of the model and the inputs, the state of the system at any time. The third part of this paper pro poses the global resolution for a sequential Petri net, and for a net with a conflict. Some examples are also given.\n2 The theory of the Petri nets\nThe Petri net is a tool for the representation and mod eling of dynamic systems [1], [2]. For example, in the intelligent vehicle area [3], the observed vehicle is mak ing a particular manoeuvre. The goal is to determine the phase of the manoeuvre at any time, with just the information of the proprioceptive sensors. In this case, each place of the Petri net can represent a phase that corresponds to a part of the circuit, and each transi tion represents the threshold on the sensor that model a phase change. A token in a particular place means the vehicle is in the corresponding phase.\n290 Jarkass and Rombaut\n2.1 The Petri net: definition and graphic presentation\nA Petri net (RdP) is composed of two knot types: the places and the transitions shown in figure ( 1). A place is represented by a circle and a transition is represented by a line between two places. The number of places and transitions is finished and not null.\nA place represents the state of the system, {for in stance, the phase of the manoeuvre) and a transition is a relationship connecting two places. It is associated to an event whose occurrence leads to the evolution of the system {for instance, a speed change) .\nA Petri net is defined by :\nRdP =< P, T, Pre, Post >\nwhere: P: the set of places Pi T: the set of transitions tj Pre: Px T --t N. It is the input incidence function. Post: TxP --t N. It is the output incidence function.\nThe Pre incidence function describes the oriented arcs connecting the places to the transitions. It represents, for each transition tj, the part of the state in which the system is before the state change when tj occurs. Pre(Pi, tj) is the weight of the arc (Pi, tj)\u00b7 The absence of one arc between a place Pi and a transition tj is denoted by Pre( Pi, tj) = 0.\nThe Post incidence function describes the oriented arcs connecting transitions to the places. It repre sents, for each transition tj, the part of the state in which the system will be after the occurrence of the state change corresponding to tj. Post(tj, Pi) is the weight of the arc (tj, Pi). The absence of an arc between a transition tj and a place Pi is denoted by Post(tj, Pi) = 0.\nIn this paper, it is assumed that Pre and Post take value in {0, 1}.\nThe figure {1) represents a Petri net {RdP) with 3 places and 3 transitions. The sets of places and of transitions are :\nP = {P1, P2, P3} T = {h, t2, t3}\nThe two matrix, Pre and Post, associated to the Pre and Post incidence functions are:\ncp\nt,\n\ufffd t2 <p \ufffd \ufffd \\ \\\nt3\nTo each transition is associated a receptivity 1 corresponding to an event on the input. Its value is one when the associated event is true.\nThe vector R(k) is the vector of receptivity rj at the time (k). (rj: the receptivity of the transition tj)\u00b7\n2.2 The dynamic aspect of the Petri net\nThe dynamic of the system is represented by the motion of a token in the net. To each place of the net a mark is associated. This mark is one when the token is in the place, and zero otherwise. The mark one in a place means the system is in the phase associated to this place. The token moves when the receptivities of the transitions are changed.\nThe mark of a place Pi at the time (k) is given by M(Pi)(k), M(k) is the associated mark vector.\nFrom an initial marking M(k)\u2022 the firing of the tran sitions gives a new mark vector M(k+l) such as :\nThe difference of the two matrix Post - Pre has the following property: the sum of the elements on each column is equal to zero which is a fundamental prop erty of the Petri nets. The Petri nets are covered by\n1 A receptivity is a logical proposal, for example, \"the speed of the vehicle is hight\".\nDealing with uncertainty on the initial state of a Petri net 291\npositive p-invariant, which is the number of tokens in the set. From an initial marking, the next marking of the net can evolve by a firing of transitions. What ever is the evolution, the number of tokens in the net stays constant.\nIn the particular cases studied here, the value of this number is one, so, at any time:\nM(Pl) + M(Pz) + ... + M(Pn) = 1 (2)\nIn fact, the mark can represent the belief of the fact that the token is in a particular place. If the mark is one, it is sure to be in the corresponding place, and if it is zero, it is sure that not. So, the mark can be seen such as the probability P(P;), to be in the corresponding place P;. So,\nM(Pi) := P(P;)\n2: M(P;) = 2: P(P;) = 1 (3) i=l...N i=l...N\nThis interpretation of the mark is compatible to the probability theory.\nThe first studied case concerns a simple Petri net, that means a sequential evolution of the net. The second study examines the case of a conflict 2.\nThe classic Petri net describes perfectly the real evo lution of the system, the initial state is well-known, and the events associated to the receptivity of the transitions are certain. In fact, for the complex systems, the net describes approximatively the system (macro states, fuzzy limits between the states) , the inputs are not always sure, and the initial state is sometimes unknown [4].\nThis paper deals with the uncertainty of the initial state parameters. It is assumed that the net is well known, and the inputs are certain. In this case, it is impossible to directly used the Petri net as presented before, because the vector M at time k = 0 cannot be initialized. With the classic Petri net, it is impossible to model the uncertainty. In the next section, the un certainty is modeled by using the theory of evidence (Dempster-Shafer's theory) .\n3 Fundamental notions on the theory of evidence\nThe theory of evidence, introduced by Dempster in 1960, was rewrited in a more mathematical form\n2The conflict is defined when at least 2 transitions come from one place.\nby Shafer in 1976 [5]. This theory is known under several names; the theory of beliefs, the theory of plausibilities or again the Dempster-Shafer's theory. It allows to represent the uncertainty on the different hypotheses of a frame of discernment n.\nThis theory comes from the well-known theory of the probability. In this last theory, the uncertainty about several hypotheses of n is modeled by an equal repartition of the probability on them. In the theory of evidence, the probability is given to the union set of them. In fact, this theory allows to define a distribution of probability, named function of mass on each element of 2\u00b0, the set of all parts of n . The mass represents the probability to be in a place or a set of places.\nIn the case of the Petri net, the definition of the frame of djscernment n corresponds to the set of hypotheses about the state of the system:\nThe set 2\u00b0 is deduced and has (2n -1)3 elements. For the Petri net of n places, 2\u00b0 is:\nThe mass m allocated to each element is therefore defined by: m : 2\u00b0 ---'* [0, 1] such as:\n\u2022 m (0) = 0,\n\u2022 Lx\ufffd2nm(X) = 1\nThis last property is similar to the conservation of the sum of the mark (equation 2) in classic Petri net. The mark of the set {P1, P2, . \u2022 . , P;} means the mass allocated to this set and it's noted by M{l , z, ... ,i}\u00b7\nThe uncertainty about the initial state is modeled by giving all the probability on the set { P1, Pz, . . . , Pn}, and all the other masses equal to zero; this proposition means that it is sure to be in n:\nm({P1, Pz, .. . , Pn}) m(X)\nM{1,2, ... ,n} = 1 0, VX f. {P1, Pz, . .. , Pn}\nIn the first paragraph, the vector of the marking is defined on places of the net, it corresponds to the belief\n3The st 0 is not included in 211\n292 Jarkass and Rombaut\nto be in a place. In the same manner, a new marking vector is defined with the distribution of masses on 2\u00b0. Its elements correspond to the belief to be in a set of place. This vector, noted M, is such as,"}, {"heading": "M = [M{l},M{2}\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,M{1,2}\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,M{1,2,3, ... ,n}]", "text": "where M{i, ... ,j} is the mass of belief of the element X = { P;, ... , Pi}. It is now necessary to determine the evolution of the vector M, when the events come on the transitions.\n4 Global resolution of the system\nThis section aims to describe the global evolution of the marking vector M(k+I) at time (k + 1), taking into account the vector M(k) and the inputs R(k+ I) at time ( k + 1), and based on the logical equations of the Petri net. The receptivities ri take the value in {0, 1}. That leads that the mark Mx of the subset of places X of 2\u00b0 takes the logical values in {0, 1}.\nIn the first step, for each element X of 2\u00b0 and for each possible com bination of the receptivities of R, noted by comb, the element Y of 2\u00b0, named transformation of X by the combination comb of R, is determined. Y verifies the following implication:\n(Mx = 1 and comb)=> (My = 1)\nIf Mx(k) = 1 at time (k), all the places P; E X are possible. At the time (k + 1) and with a combination of receptivities of R(k+I)\u2022 all the places Pj E Y that verify the equation (1) are possible. The places Pj are the transformation of the places P; by R(k+l)\u00b7 So, Y, the transformation of X by the combination comb of R(k+I)\u2022 is the set of the Pj.\nIn the second step, for each Y, all the couple of (X, comb) that lead toY are determined. The new state of Y is a combination of all possible (X, comb).\n4.1 Example: a simple Petri net with 3 places\nFor the example of the Petri net presented in figure ( 1), the frame of discernment is n = {PI , P2, P3}, and the set 2\u00b0 is:\n2\u00b0 = {{PI}, {P2}, {Pa}, {PI, P2}, {PI, Pa}, {P2, Pa}, {PI, P2, Pg}}\nThe vector M is:\nM [M{ 1}, M{2}, M{a}, M{1,2}\u2022 M{l,a}, M{2,a}, M{1,2,3}]\nThe transformation of each element of 2\u00b0 is computed for each possible value comb of the receptivity vector of the transitions. A transition t; has the receptivity r;, which can be 1 or 0, if 1, r; is true, and if 0, fj is true. r; means that the transition t; can be fired, and fj means the transition cannot be fired. For example, the sequence fi r2fa, that corresponds toR= [0, 1, 0], means that only the transition t2 can be fired, if PI is true.\nFirst step Because there are three transitions, 23 = 8 combina tions of the receptivities r; are possible. The transfor mation computation of two elements X of 2\u00b0 is pre sented as follows:\n{PI}\nr\ufffd3 {P2} r\ufffd3 {PI} r\ufffd3 {PI} r\ufffd3 {P2} r\ufffd3 {P2} r\ufffd3 {PI} r\ufffd3 {P2} r\ufffd3 {PI}\nr\ufffd3 {P2, Pa} r\ufffd3 {PI, Pa} r\ufffd3 {PI} r\ufffd3 {P2, Pa} r\ufffd3 {PI, P2} r\ufffd3 {PI} r\ufffd3 {PI,P2} r\ufffd3 {PI,Pa}\nThis computation is made for all the X elements of 2\u00b0.\nSecond step From these maps, inverted transformation is made: for all Y of 2\u00b0, the corresponding X are determined.\nFor example, all couples with transformation as {PI} are: {PI} by [ri, r2, ra] -+ {PI} {PI} by [- - f ri,r2,r3 -+ {PI} {PI} by [- - f ri,r2,r3 -+ {PI} {PI} by [r1, r2, r3]T -+ {PI} {Pg} by (- - ]T ri,r2,r3 -+ {PI} {Pg} by [ri, f2, rgf -+ {PI} {Pg} by [ri, r2, rgf -+ {PI} {Pa} by [ri, r2, rg]T -+ {PI} {PIP3} by (- - ]T ri,r2,ra -+ {PI} {P1Pa} by [ri, r2, r gf -+ {PI}\nThe expression of M{l}(k+l)' at time (k+1), is there-\nDealing with uncertainty on the initial state of a Petri net 293\nfore:\n( f1 f2f3 + f1 r2f3\n+ f1f2r3 + f1r2r3).M{1}(k)\n+ (f1f2r3 + r1f2r3 + f1r2r3 + r1r2r3).M{3}(k)\n+ (f1f2r3 + f1r2r3).M{l,3}(k)\nBy factorisation of this expression, it is obtained:\nIn the same manner, the expression of the mass my of all the subsets of places Y of 2\u00b0 is determined. The following equations are obtained:\nM{l}(k+l)\nM{2}(k+l)\nM{3}(k+l)\nM{1,2}(k+l)\nM{1,3}(k+l)\nM{2,3} (k+l)\nM{1,2,3}(k+l)\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nf1M{l}(k) + r3M{3}(k)\nftr3M{l,3}(k)\nf2M{2}(k) + r1M{1}(k)\nf2r1M{1,2}(k)\nf3M{3}(k) + r2M{2}(k)\nf3r2M{2,3}(k)\nf1f2M{1,2}(k) + rlr3M{l,3}(k)\nf2r3(M{2,3}(k) + M{1,2,3}(k))\nflf3M{l,3}(k) + r2r3M{2,3}(k)\nf1r2(M{1,2}(k) + M{1,2,3}(k))\nf2f3M{2,3}(k) + r1r2M{1,2}(k)\nr3rl(M{l,3}(k) + M{l,2,3}(k))\n(r1f2f3 + r1r2r3)M{1,2,3}(k)\nIf the initial state of the system is given by the vector M(o) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], (unknown initial state, M{l,2,3} = 1 and Mx = 0, V X =f. {1,2,3}), and ac cording to the sequence of the receptivities taken from the system, the new state becomes more precise. For example, if R(l) = (0,1,0), the new marking of the sys tem is M(l) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0), and the mass M{1,3} of X = {P1, P3} becomes 1; it is certain not to be in the place P2.\n4.2 General property\nIt has been shown in section 2.2, that the most im portant propriety in this type of net is the p-invariant as it is presented in equation 2. The new mark vec tor M(k) is defined such as a distribution of masses on the set 2\u00b0, so it is assumed that at time ( k), the p-invariant is equal to one:\nL M(X)(k) = 1 XE2\u00b0\nThe transformation proposed before, leads to a new vector M(k+l)\u00b7 It is shown below that the p-invariant is still equal to one.\nIn fact, when M (X) is equal to one, that means all the places P; E X are possible (but not sure) . In order to find the following state, the algorithm consists of giving a mark equal to one to each place in X.\nVifP; E X,M({P;}) = 1\nSo the usual evolution equation (1) of Petri net is ap plied. Because the initial mass is not equal to 1, the final mass can be different that 1. All the places with mass different to zero are then possible, but it is im possible to determine if one is more possible than an other. So, all the masses are given to the union of these places. By using this method, it is not needed to give at priori probability on each place P; of X, contrary in using the theory of probability. A possible element X of 2\u00b0 gives only one possible element Y of 2\u00b0 such as M(Y) = 1 after the evolution of the net. So, the sum of the masses after evolution is equal to one:\nL M(X)(k+l) = 1 XE2\u00b0\nIn the general case, the global evolution equations can not be easily deduced. In fact, the number of possible configuration is equal to (2n -l * 2n) for a single net with n places and n transitions. If the initial mass is . given for a single place P;, the resolution is simplified and corresponds to a classic Petri net:\n{P;}\ufffd } {P;-d\ufffd _ {P;} { n. P\u00b7}ri-tri .r,_l, ' --t\nThe logical equation that computes the mass of an element set {Pi} at the time (k + 1) is given by:\nf; * M{i}(k) + Tj-1 * M{i-l}(k)\n+ Ti-l* f; * M{i-l,i}(k)\nBut in case of unknown initial place, the general equa tions cannot be easily written. The more the number of places in the system increases, the more the number of possible places combinations increases. A possible solution is to decompose the net in subnets, the state of each subnet depends only on one transition ij (4].\n294 Jarkass and Rombaut\nThe usual solution in classic Petri net is to forbid a conflict where the two transitions are simultaneously true. This is equivalent to the relation (r1 and r2) # 1: r1 * r2 ::; 1, so only one token is in the net. In the example represented (figure 2) , the problem comes with the two transitions after P1. The classic Petri net leads to the following equations:\nM ( {P2} )(k+l) = fs * M ( {P2} )(k) + r1 * M ( {Pt} )(k)\nM ({Ps})(k+l) = r4 * M ({Ps})(k) + r2 * M ({Pt})(k)\nIf r1 1, and simultaneously r2 1 and M ({Pt})(k) 1, then M ({P2})(k+l) 1, M ( {Ps})(k+l) = 1 and the hypothese of the pinvariant becomes false 0::::::\ufffd=1 M ( { P;}) = 2) . The two matrix Pre and Post for this type of Petri net are :\nt1 t2 ts t4\nPre= [ ; ; \ufffd \ufffd ] 0 0 0 1\nt1 t2 ts [ 0 0 1\nPost= 1 0 0 0 1 0\nIn case of conflict, some lines of these two matrix have several 1. Using the constraint on the transitions t1 and t2 means the token in the place P1 can leave to go in the place P2, in the place P3, or it can remain in its initial place P1, but it cannot moved into the two places P2 and P3 simultaneously. And therefore the two transitions it and t2 can not be fired at the same time because of this constraint.\nIn general case with the new mark M, the problem is the same. It is assumed at the time (k), that the mark of X E 2\u00b0 is equal to one (M(X)(k) = 1) . At the time (k + 1) comes a new vector of receptivity R(k+l)\u00b7 The transformation of X, the set Y E 2\u00b0, must be determined. The same method, described in section 4 is used. All the P; of X are possible, and their mark is put to one. Then; the equation (1) is applied, in order to get a new mark vector. The set Y is the union of all the places with a mark different to zero.\nIn the case of conflict, the following assumption is made: the two transitions cannot be true simultane ously. So, if the two places of the conflict are not initially in X, so only one of the two places could be in Y. But, if one or more places of the conflict are initially in X, the two places can be in Y after the application of equation (1) .\nIn the example of figure (2) , it is assumed that, at the time (k) , M{1,2}(k) = 1. At the time (k + 1) , only r2 = 1, so the set Y = {P2, Ps}. These two places in conflict can be simultaneously possible.\nA Petri net with a conflict is not a problem in case of general resolution, if the same constraint on receptiv ities as the classic Petri net are assumed.\n6 Conclusion and prospectives\nHere, a method is proposed to deal with the initial state uncertainty of the Petri net. This method is based on the model of uncertainty from Dempster and Shafer. As in a classic Petri net, the mark of a place P; can be taken as the \"probability\" to be in this place. The generalized mark M of the Petri net corresponds to the \"probability\" to be in a set of places P;. The equations of evolution are done, in a simple Petri net, and in a Petri net with conflict.\nThe first and most important problem comes with the number of operations needed to compute . the expression of all marks. This calculation is long and complex. Indeed, for a system of n places, the set 2\u00b0 had 2n - 1 elements, and for n transitions, there are 2n possible combinations. The resolution of the system leads to the study of (2n - 1) * 2n different cases. More, the equations are linked to the global structure of the net. The solution can not be found in the general case. Nevertheless, this method solves the problem when the state of the system is unknown, and verifies the principle of the mass conservation. It allows to take a decision at any time. A possible solution to this problem is to take each transitions as a source of information, and then to decompose the net in a set of subnets.\nDealing with uncertainty on the initial state of a Petri net 295\nFigure 3: System with synchronization\nIn this paper, the problem of synchronisation in a Petri net such as has presented in the figure (3), has be not studied. The problem is that there are two tokens in the net. A possible solution can be the same such as in the classic Petri net: considering the net such as two independant nets.\nFinally, the problem of data uncertainty on the inputs will be studied in future works. This leads to take a value in the interval [0, 1], instead of {0, 1} for the receptivity, [6], [7]. Some works have to be done in the case of fuzzy Petri nets [8], [9], the method must be applied to these Petri nets.\nReferences\n[1] D. Rene and A. Hassan. Du Grafcet aux n5seaux de Petri.

This paper proposes a method to find the ac\u00ad tual state of a complex dynamic system from information coming from the sensors on the system himself, or on its environment. The nominal evolution of the system is a pri\u00ad ori known and can be modeled (by an expert, for example) , by different methods. In this paper, the Petri nets have been chosen. Con\u00ad trary to the usual use of the Petri nets, the initial state of the system is unknown. So a degree of belief is bound to each places, or set of places. The theory used to model this un\u00ad certainty is the Dempster-Shafer's one which is well adapted to this type of problems. From the given Petri net characterizing the nominal evolution of the dynamic system, and from the observation inputs, the pro\u00ad posed method allows to determine according to the reliability of the model and the inputs, the state of the system at any time.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
