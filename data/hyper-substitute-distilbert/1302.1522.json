One particular al\u00ad gorithm, structured policy construction achieves this by means of a decision theoretic analog of goal regression, using action descriptions based on Bayesian networks with tree-structured condi\u00ad tional probability tables. The algorithm as pre\u00ad sented is not able to deal with actions with cor\u00ad related effects. We describe a new decision theo\u00ad retic regression operator that corrects this weak\u00ad ness. While conceptually straightforward, this extension requires a somewhat more complicated technical approach.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
