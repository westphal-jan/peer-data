Because of errors in model construction and changes in the dynamics of the domains, we cannot afford to ignore the infor\u00ad mation in new data. While sequential update of parameters for a fixed structure can be accom\u00ad plished using standard techniques, sequential up\u00ad date of network structure is still an open problem. In this paper, we investigate sequential update of Bayesian networks were both parameters and structure are expected to change. We introduce a new approach that allows for the flexible ma\u00ad nipulation of the tradeoff between the quality of the learned networks and the amount of informa\u00ad tion that is maintained about past observations. We formally describe our approach including the necessary modifications to the scoring functions for learning Bayesian networks, evaluate its effec\u00ad tiveness through and empirical study, and extend it to the case of missing data.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
