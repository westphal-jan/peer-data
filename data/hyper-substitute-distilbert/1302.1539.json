The idea is that subtracting the current image from a time\u00ad averaged background image will leave only non\u00ad stationary objects. It is, however, a crude ap\u00ad proximation to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a mixture-of-Gaussians classi\u00ad fication model for each pixel using an unsuper\u00ad vised technique-an efficient, incremental ver\u00ad sion of EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this automatically updates the mixture component for each class according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other techniques such as thresholding. Ap\u00ad plication of this method as part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is expected to result in significant improvements in vehicle identification and tracking.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
