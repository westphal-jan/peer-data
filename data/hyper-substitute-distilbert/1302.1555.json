We re\u00ad examine the question of variable discretization in a hybrid network aiming at minimizing the in\u00ad formation loss induced by the discretization. We show that a nonuniform partition across all vari\u00ad ables as opposed to uniform partition of each vari\u00ad able separately reduces the size of the data struc\u00ad tures needed to represent a continuous function. We also provide a simple but efficient procedure for nonuniform partition. To represent a nonuni\u00ad form discretization in the computer memory, we introduce a new data structure, which we call a Bi\u00ad nary Split Partition (BSP) tree. We show that BSP trees can be an exponential factor smaller than the data structures in the standard uniform discretiza\u00ad tion in multiple dimensions and show how the BSP trees can be used in the standard join tree algo\u00ad rithm. We show that the accuracy of the inference process can be significantly improved by adjusting discretization with evidence. We construct an it\u00ad erative anytime algorithm that gradually improves the quality of the discretization and the accuracy of the answer on a query. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm converges.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
