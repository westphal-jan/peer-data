In particular, using fuzzy logic to rea son in a probabilistic way may be a priori considered as a \"dangerous mixture\" of both formalism'>. In this sense, the aim of this paper is twofold. First to stress the differences between fuzzy logic and probability the ory, making clear that they are different formalisms addressing different problems and using diffm\u00b7ent tech niques. Second to show how it is possible to con sistently use them together by proposing a new and meaningful approach to probabilistic reasoning based on fuzzy logic. The topic of relating probability and logic is not by far new. A number of logics of prob ability have been proposed in the literature, as those in !Scott and Kraus, 1966; Hajek and Havranek, 1978; Gaifman and Snir, 1982; Nilsson, 1986; BacchlL'3, 1990; Halpern, 1989; Wilson and Moral, 1994]. But all of them except for !Hajek and Havranek, 1978] are based on classical two-valued logic. Here we propose a propo sitional fuzzy logic of probability for which complete-\nness results are provided. The main idea behind this approach is that probability values of crisp proposi tions can be understood as truth-values of some suit able fuzzy propositiotlS associated to the crisp ones.\nBefore going to the technical details in next sections, and in order to avoid misunderstandings, we start by addressing and clarifying the main notions involved in this paper.\nMain difference between fuzzy logic and prob ability theory\nIn our opinion any serious discussion on the relation between fuzzy logic and probability must start by mak ing clear the basic differences. Admitting some simpli fication, we cotL'>ider that fuzzy logic is a logic of vague, imprecise notions and propositions, propositions that may be more or less true. Fuzzy logic is then a logic of partial degrees of truth. On the contrary, probabil ity deal'3 with crisp notimlS and propositions, proposi tions that are either true or false; the probability of a proposition is the degree of belief on the truth of that proposition. If we want to consider both as uncertainty degrees we have to stress that they represent very dif ferent sorts of uncertainty (Zimmermann calls them linguistic and stochastic uncertainty, respectively). If we prefer to reserve the word \"uncertainty\" to refer to degrees of belief, then clearly fuzzy logic does not deal with uncertainty at all. The main difference lies in the fact that degrees of belief are not extensional (truth-functional), e.g. the probability of p A q is not a function of the probability of p and the probabil ity of q, whereas degrees of truth of vague notions admit truth-functional approaches (although they are not bound to them). Formally speaking, fuzzy logic behaves as a many-valued logic, whereas probability theory can be related to a kind of two-valued modal logic (cf. e.g. !Hajek, 1993} or !Hajek, 1994} for more details, also IKiir and Folger, 19881). Thus, fuzzy logic is not a \"poor man's probability theory\", as some peo ple claim.\nComparing fuzzy logic and probability\nNevertheles.'>, relationships . between fuzzy logic and\n238 Hajek, Godo, and Esteva\nprobability theory have been studied. They have not only been compared but also combined. First of all, we refer to [Zadeh, 1986j; even if the title of Zadeh's pa per ends with the words \"a negative view\", he is rather positive in combining fuzziness and probability by sug gesting a definition of the probability of a fuzzy propo sition. Another important paper is I Dubois and Prade, 19931, in which the authors extensively survey the lit erature concerning the relationship between fuzzy sets and probability theories; again, besides pointing out the gaps between them, the authors build bridges be tween both theories, stressing in this sense the impor tance of possibility theory. Our paper is an attempt to contribute further to this bridge building.\nProbability is ground on classical equivalence\nWe restrict ourselves to propositional calculws; i.e. for mulas are built from propositional variables and con nectives (negation -., implication -+ and possibly oth ers. We shall consider only calculi in which other con nectives are definable from negation and implication.\nFormulas can be endowed with various semantics, among them the classical (boolean, two-valued): there are just two truth values 0 and 1, each evaluation e of propositional variables by zeros and ones extends uniquely to an evaluation of all formulas lL'>ing cla.<:r sical truth tables. Two formula.<> cp, '1/J are classic.ally equivalent if e( cp) e( 1/1) for any boolean evaluation e. The second semantics of our interest i'.l that of Lukasiewicz's infinite-11alued calculm: truth values are real numbers from the unit interval [0, lJ, and truth functions are\n1-x X-+y min(l, 1 -x + y)\n(we take the freedom of denoting a truth function by the same symbol as its corresponding connective). Under this second semantics, cp, 'lj1 are \u00a3-equivalent if e( cp) e( '1/J) for any real-valued Lukasiewicz evalu ation e. Neglecting the difference between cla.'3Sical and many-valued equivalence of formula.'> ha.'> been the source of known misunderstandings conceming fuzzy logic. Clearly, if two formulas are L-equivalent then they are cla.'3Sically equivalent, but the converse does not hold.\nOn the other hand, a (finitely additive) probabilit11 on formulas is a mapping P a.<>signing to each formula \u00b7cp a real number P(cp) in [0, 1] preserving cla.'lsical equivalence (i.e. if cp, '\u00a21 are cla.-ssically equivalent then P( cp) = P( 'if;)) and satisfying the well known condi tions: P(true) 1, P(false) = 0, and if cpA'I/1 is cla.'.lsi cally equivalent to false then P(cpv.,P) = P(cp)+P(1/J). Here true is a classical identically true fonnula, e.g. p -+ p, false is -.true, cp V 1/, is ( cp -+ '1/J) -+ V' (this is a possible definition of disjunction from implication) and cp A 'I/1 is -.(-.cpv-..,P). In other word'>, a probability is in fact a function on the Boolean algebra of cla.-sses of clas<.;ically equivalent formula.'>.\nCan the probability of a formula be under stood as the truth degree of the same for mula?\nClearly not in the truth-functional case: just because probabilities are not truth-functional. However this is possible in the non-truth functional case. Let us mention for instance the paper [Gerla, 1994), where the author exhibits an abstract, non-truth functional fuzzy logical system whose set of interpretations consists of all probabilities on the set of all formulas and presents a complete deductive system for this.\nCan we understand the probability of a for mula as the truth degree of another one 1\nOur claim is that we can when the other formula ex presses something like that the former one is \"prob able\". This is the heart of our approach. Probabil ity preserves classical equivalence and therefore \"un derstands\" formulas as crisp propositions. But prob ability is just a variable (like pressure, temperature, etc.) and we may make fuzzy assertions on it: if cp is any formula we may say \"cp is probable' or \"probabil ity_of-'P is high\", and these are typical fuzzy proposi tions. Such approach was suggested in !Hajek and Har mancova, 1994]; fuzzy propositions about probabilities are also disclL'3Sed in !Zimmermann, 19911. Our aim is to describe a fuzzy theory in the frame of the truth functional Lukasiewicz-Pavelka's logic which naturally relates to probability theory. Notice that our approach will clearly distinguish between propositiono:; like \"(l? is probable) and ('1/1 is probable)\" on the one hand and \"(cp A 1/1) i'.l probable\" in the other.\nFuzzy theories and their logic\nFollowing Pavelka [Pavelka, 19791, we define a fu.zzy theory to be just a fuzzy set of formulas: if T is a fuzzy theory and T( cp) = x (denoting that the membership degree of cp to T is x) then cp is an axiom to the degree x. Semantics is given by a set Sem of fuzzy sets of formula.'>; each element M of Semis understood as an interpretation of the language, i.e. M ( cp) = x is read as \"cp is true in M to the degree x\". M is a model of T if for any cp, M(cp) ;::: T(cp), i.e. each formula is at leMt as much true in Mas the T-degree of axiomness demand'>. \u00b7\nlu a truth-functional approach, Sem is the set of all evaluations of formulas obtained from evaluations of propositional variables by means of some particular truth functions, e.g. the Lukasiewicz truth functions -,..., above mentioned. But let us stress that other choices which lead to non-truth functional systems are also possible. In any case one should try to exhibit some notion of proof and try to prove some complete ness result.\nThe paper is organized as follows. After this intro duction we survey in Section 2 the Rational Pavelka's\nLogic- a generalization of Lukasiewicz's logic discov ered by Pavelka and simplified by Hajek. In Section 3 we present our fuzzy theory of probability and prove a completeness result. In Section 4 we comment on pos sible extensions and uses of the proposed approach. Finally, Section 5 contains some discussion on open problems and concluding remarks.\n2 Rational Pavelka's Logic\nLukasiewicz's infinitely-valued logic only allows us to prove !-tautologies, but in fuzzy logic we are interested in inference from partially true assumptions, admitting that the conclusion will also be partially true. Rational Pavelka's Logic RP L is an extension of Lukasiewicz's infinitely-valued logic admitting graded formulas and graded proofs. It is described in a simple formalization in [Hajek, 1995j. Since the approach described in this paper strongly relies on this logic, here we present the main notions and properties of it.\n2.1 Formulas are built from propositional variables Pl,P2, . . . and truth constants r for each mtional r E [0, 1J using connectives -+ and ...,, Other connectives are defined from these ones. In particular, among oth ers, Pavelka defines two conjunctions and two disjunc t\ufffdons exactly as in Lukasiewicz's logic, i.e.\ncp&'f/1 cpY.1/J cpV1/J cp/\\1/J cp+-+1/J stand<> for stand<> for stand<> for stands for stands for -,( cp -+ ...,t/1) -,cp -+ t/1 ( cp -+ 'f/1) -+ 1/1 -,( -,cp v ...,1{1) ( cp -+ t/1) 1\\ ( 1{1 -+ cp)\nTaking into account the Lukasiewicz's truth functions corresponding to -+ and -,, it is easy to check that the truth functions for the above connectives are the following ones:\nr& s = rY.s rVs rl\\s\nr+-+s\nmax(O, r + s- 1) min(r + s, 1) max(r, s) min(r, s) min(1- r + s, 1- s + r)\nAn evaluation of atoms is now a mapping of atomic propositions into [0, 1 J. Such mappings extend uniquely to an evaluation of all formulas respecting the above truth functions.\nA gmded formula is a pair ( cp, r) where cp is a formula and r E [0, lJ is rational. Such a formula is understood as saying that \"the truth value of cp is at least r\".\nLogical axioms are:\n(i) axioms of Lukasiewicz's logic (all in degree 1)\ncp-+ ( 1{1-+ cp) (cp- 1{1)- ((t/1- x)-+ (cp -+ x)) (-,cp-+ -,'lj1)-+ (1/1-+ cp) ((cp-+ 1/1)-+ 1/1)-+ (('1/1-+ cp)-+ cp)\nFuzzy logic and probability 239\n(ii) bookkeeping axioms: (for arbitrary rational r, s E [0, 11):\nr in degree r' -,r +-+ -,'f in degree 1,\nr -+ s +-+ (r -+ s) in degree 1. 1\nDeduction rules are:\n(i) modus ponens: from (cp, r) and (cp-+ 1/J,s) derive (1/l,r&s)\n(ii) truth constant introduction: from (cp, s) derive (r-+ cp, r-+ s).\nWe define a gmded proof from a fuzzy theory T as a sequence of graded formulas\n(cpt. r1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (cpn, rn)\nsuch that for each i, (cpi> ri) is either a logical axiom (i.e. cpi is a logical axiom in degree ri) or ( cpi, ri) is an axiom of T (i.e. T(cpi) = ri) or (cpi, ri) follows from some previous member(s) of the sequence by a deduction rule. We say that T proves cp in degree r, denoted T 1- (cp, r), if there is a graded proof from T whose last element is {cp, r). The provability degree of cp inT is l cp lr = sup{r I T 1- (cp, r)}. The truth degree of cp in T is llcpllr = inf{e(cp) I e evaluation, e model ofT}. Notice that both llcpllr and l cp lr may be irrational.\n2.2 Completeness theorem for RPL. For each T and cp,\nI cp lr = llcpllr i.e. the provability degree equals to the truth degree.\n3 A fuzzy logic of probability\nIn this section we are going to define a fuzzy theory in RP L, that we shall call F P, directly related to prob ability theory. We start with a set of propositional variables p, q, . . . and the set of all propositional for mula.<> built from them. Since we shall be interested in probabilities of these formulas, and hence in classical equivalence, we shall only use for them one conjunction and one disjunction, say 1\\ and V. We call these for mula.<> crisp formulas. As suggested in [Hajek and Har mancova, 19941, we associate with each crisp formula cpa new propositional variable f'i', which will be read as \"cp is PROBABLE\", or \"PROBABILITY_OF_cp is HIGH''. This is understood as a fuzzy proposi tion, and given a probability P, we are free to define e(f 'i' ) = P(cp), i.e. assign the probability value P(cp) a.<> the truth-value of f'i'. We may call the variables of the form f 'i' fuzzy propositional variables and they will be taken as the propositional\u00b7 variables of our fuzzy theory FP. Next we precisely define the FP theory and show it is probabilistically meaningful.\n1 Examples of bookkeeping axioms: for r = 0.4 and s = 0.3 we get 0.6 +-+ -,0.4 and 0.9 +-+ (0,4 -+ 0.3).\n240 Hajek, Godo, and Esteva\n3.1 Syntax of F P.F P-formulas are just RPL formulas built from fuzzy propositional variables, i.e. formulas built from variables of the form f\"' using con nectives. The Axioms of F P are those of RP L (see above) plus:\n{FP1) {!\"', 1) for cp being an axiom of classical propo sitional logic {the obvious three schemes),\n{FP2) {!\"'_.\"'-+ (!\"'-+ fv,), 1) for all cp, 1/1,\n(FP3) (f -.cp +-+ -.J 'P\u2022 1) for each cp, and\n(FP4) (/cpv,p +-+ ({!\"'-+ f<pi\\,P)-+ /,p], 1) for each cp, 1/J.\nNotice that (FP3) and (FP4) axioms are direct trans lations of two of the well-known axioms of probabil ity, namely the relationship between the probability of one proposition and its negation and the finitely additivity property. Axioms {F P1) and {F P2) guar antee the preservation of cla.'>Sical equivalence and the monotonicity as it is proved in the next lemma and corollary.\n3.2 Lemma. If cp is a boolean tautology (i.e. provable in boolean propositional calculw;;) then FP proves fcp in degree 1.\n3.3. Corollary. For any \"crisp\" formula.\"! cp and 1/' we have: (1) If cp -+ 1/J is a boolean tautology then F P proves f cp -+ f ,p in degree 1. {2) Hence if cp +-+ 1/J is a boolean tautology then F P proves f\"' +-+ f ,p in degree 1. {3) F P proves /cpAtJI-+ !\"' in degree 1.\nNext we show that F P has exactly the intended se mantics , that is, models of F P are defined by proba bility functions on the set of crisp formula.\"!.\n3.4 Theorem. An evaluation e of atomic F P formulas is a model of the theory F P if, and only if, the mapping P defined on crisp formulas by P(cp).= e{f\"') is a finitely additive probability on crisp formula.\"!.\nProof.\n(1) Let e be a model of F P and define P(cp) = e(f\"') for all cp. If cp is classically equivalent to 1/1 then F P f (f\"' +-+ f,p, 1) by {2) of Corollary 3.3, hence e(fcp +-+ f,p) = 1, e{f\"') = e(f,p) and therefore P(cp) = P('l/1); thus P preserves logical equivalence. Clearly, F P f Utrue, 1) and F P f- (-.!Jalse, 1), hence P(true) = 1 and P(false) = 0. Also P(-,cp) = -.P(cp) is clear from {FP3). Now take arbitrary cp, 1/J and put a = P(cp V 1/J), b = P(cp), c = P('lj1), d = P(cp A 1/1). By {FP4), a = (b -+ d) -+ c and b \ufffd d (by Corollary 3.3); thus a = {1 - b + d) -+ c. Now 1/' -+ (cp -+ (cp 1\\ 1/1)) is a Boolean tautology, hence F P f- (f ,p -+ {!\"' -+ !\"'1\\\",), 1) and hence c = e(Jv,) ::; e(f\"' -+ !<pAt/,) = 1-b+d; thlL\"' a= (1-b+d)-+ c = 1-(1-b+d) + c =\nb + c -d. Thus P is a probability.\n{2) Conversely, assume that P is a probability on crisp formulas and put e{f\"') = P(cp). We verify that e assigns 1 to each axiom of F P. Clearly, if cp is an axiom of classical logic then cp is a Boolean tautology and hence e{f\"') = P(cp) = 1. This verifies {FP1). To verify (F P2) we show P(cp-+ 1/J) ::; (P(cp) -+ P('l{J)). Put now P( cp 1\\ 1/J) = a, P( cp 1\\ -.'ljJ) = b, P( -.cp 1\\ 1/J) = c, P( -.cp 1\\ -.1/J) = d; then P( cp -+ 1/J) = 1 - b, whereas (P(cp) -+ P('l{J) = 1- (a + b) + (a + c) = 1 - b + c \ufffd P(cp-+ 1/J) as desired. Under the present meaning of a, b, c, d we have e{fcpv,p) = P(r.p V .,P) =a+ b + c, and e((J\"' -+ f<pi\\,P) -+ f,p) = ((a + b) -+ a) -+ (a + c) = (1 - b) -+ (a + c) = a + b + c. This verifies (FP4); (FP3) is evident. 0\nIn [Hajek and Harmancova, 1994] the authors raised the question whether it could be pos.\"'ible for a fuzzy theory to have an axiomatization probabilistically complete in some sense. Here we give a positive an swer.\n3.5 Definition. A fuzzy theory T is stronger than F P if for each formula ci> in the language of F P, T( ci>) \ufffd F P(cl>) (i.e. all the axioms {FP1) ... {FP4) get the value 1 in T). A probability P on crisp formulas is a model ofT if the corresponding evaluation ep of atoms of FP, defined as ep(J\"') = P(cp), is a model ofT.\n3.6 Corollary. LetT be a fuzzy theory stronger than F P. Then, for each FP-formula cl>,\nI ci> lr= inf { e p ( ci>) I P probability, P model of T}.\nThis follows directly from completeness of RP L and from theorem 3.4.\n3. 7 Corollary. (Probabilistic Completeness for F P) In particular, for each crisp formula cp,\nI!\"' lr= inf{P(cp) I P probability, P model ofT},\n1- I f-.,\"' lr= sup{P(cp) I P probability, P model ofT}.\nThis result tells lL\"' that if T f- (f 'P\u2022 r) then for every probability P which is a model ofT, P(r.p) \ufffd r; and also that if T If (f \"'' r) (i.e. there is no T-proof of r.p to the degree r) then for each r' > r there exists a probability P which is a model of T and such that P(cp) < r'.\n3.8 Remarks. Axioms {FPl) and (FP2) could be replaced by other two (less elegant) axioms, namely by:\n(FPl') Utrue1 1) , and (FP2') (f'l' -+ f,p, 1), for any cp and 1/J such that r.p-+ 1/J is a boolean tautology.\nNotice that (F P2') is a direct expression of the mono tonicity of probability measures with respect to set\ninclusion. Notice also that (FP4) may be replaced in turn by the following axiom:\n(FP4') ((f<pV1/J--+ f'P) ..._. (f.t/,--+ /<p/\\1/J), 1) which is another equivalent expression for the additiv ity property. As a final remark, let us mention also that in F P is not obvious how to represent statements about strict lower or upper bounds of probability.\n3.9 Example. We present here an example of a proof in F P, in particular we show how to prove that f\"' .,... (!\"'\"1/J Y.. '\"'\"-.1/J) is a theorem of FP, corresponding to the well known property of probability functions stating that P( cp) = P( cp 1\\ 1/J) + P( cp 1\\ ..,1/J). Clearly,\nFP 1- (f<p ...... /(<p/\\1/J)V(<p/\\-ot/J)\u2022 1);\nby (FP 4), writing cp1 for cp 1\\ 1/J and cpO for cp 1\\ ..,1/J, w\ufffd;; get the following chain of deductions:\nFP 1- FP 1- FP 1- FP 1- FP 1- FP 1- (/<p!V<pO ..._. ({f<pl--+ f<pll\\<pO)--+ /'Po), 1), (f<pll\\<pO ..._. 0, 1}, ((/<pi--+ f<pt/\\<pO) ..._...,,<pi, 1), (/<piV<pO ..._. (-,f<pl--+ f<po), 1), {f!fllVcpO ..._.(/If'! '::f_/cpo), 1) , (!If' ...... (/cp/\\t/1 Y.. f'f'/\\-ot/1), 1)\nThis completes the example.\n4 Possible extensions\nThe approach described so far is suitable for further developing at least along two main stream<>. On the one hand, we obviously need to extend RP L with new connectives if we want to deal with conditional probabilities. This is addressed in subsection (a). On the other hand, the proposed approach can be easily adapted to cope with other uncertainty models, the main point being to replace the characteristic axioms of probability theory in F P by the corresponding ax ioms characterizing other uncertainty models. As a matter of example, we shall provide in subsection (b) the fuzzy theory F N corresponding to Possibility The ory and prove its completeness.\n(a) Dealing with conditional probabilities\nThe first idea in extending the framework presented in the previous section to deal with conditional probabil ities is to look for the possibility of expressing con ditional probabilitiy values as truth-values of fuzzy formulas, just as it has done in Section 3 for uncon ditional probabilities. Obviou<>ly, to do so, we need to introduce new connectives in the language, \u00ae and \u00ae--+, corresponding to the product conjunction and its residuated implication (division) respectively. Then, for instance, P( 1/1 I cp) 2: a could be expressed as (!\"' \u00ae--+ f'f'\"t/1\u2022 a} . This approach has technical problems due to the lack of continuity of the truth function as sociated to \u00ae--+ (see section 5). However, assuming\nFuzzy logic and probability 241\nthat P(cp) > 0, one can always express the inequal ity P('I/J I cp) 2: a as P(cp 1\\ 1/J) 2: aP(cp). Therefore, as a first step, we can focus on extending the Rational Pavelka's Logic with only the new conjunction connec tive\u00ae, having the product as its corresponding truth function. This is done below by defining the fuzzy theory RP L +, the extension of RP L, as follows.\n4.1 Syntax. Formulas of RPL+ are built as in RPL, just adding the connective \u00ae to the language. Logical axioms of RP L + are those of RP L plus - monotonicity:\n(cp--+ 1/J)--+ ((cp \u00ae x)--+ (1/J \u00ae x))\n( cp --+ 1/J) --+ ( (x \u00ae cp) - (x \u00ae 1/J)) - bookeeping: r\u00aes.,...rxs all of them in degree 1.\nThis extension can be proved to be complete w.r.t. the above semantics, that is, the following theorem holds.\n4.2 Completeness theorem for RP L +. For each theory T and formula cp of RP L +,\nI cp lr = II'PIIT, i.e. in RP L + the provability degree also equals to the truth degree.\nNow we are ready to define the probabilistic fuzzy the ory F p+ analogously to F P, just by replacing the ax ioms of RP L by those of RP L +. In the language of F p+ we are actually able to express statements about conditional probabilities by means of formulas like\n(a\u00ae f\"' --+ f If'\"\"'' 1) expressing that the conditional probability of 1/J given cp is not smaller than a, provided that the probability of cp is known to be greater than 0. This is formalized by next theorem.\n4.3 Theorem. Let T be a theory stronger than F p+ and let cp a crisp proposition such that I cp lr > 0. Then I a \u00ae f\"' --+ f \"'\"\"' lr = 1 if and only if, for each proba bility P which is a model of T, it is the case that P(1/1 I cp) 2: a.\nProof If I a\u00ae !If' --+ f'f'\"t/1 lr = 1 then by completeness we have that ep(a \u00ae !If' --+ '\"'\"1/J) = 1 for any prob ability P model of T, i.e. a \u00b7 P(cp) \ufffd P(cp A 1/J), and hence P('I/J I cp) 2: a, provided that P(cp) > 0, but this is guaranteed by having I cp lr > 0.0\nMoreover, statements about conditional independence saying that for instance cp and 1/J are independent given x could be also expressed by means of axioms extend ing FP+ as\n((/rp\"t/l\"x \u00ae fx).,... (!1/J\"x \u00ae '\"'\"x), 1)\n242 Hajek, Godo, and Esteva\nFurther results about the probabilistic completeness of F p+ will deserve future attention.\n(b) A fuzzy logic for possibility theory\nAs an example of the fact that fuzzy logic is also a suit able framework to describe other uncertainty models different from probability theory, we present below the fuzzy theory FPS to reason with formulas valued with possibility and necessity degrees. Possibility theory, as uncertainty model, has been widely developed from a logical point of view under the so-called Possibilistic Logic (see e.g. [Dubois et al., 1994] for an extensive survey). Possibilistic logic obviously does not need the whole machinery we are going to use, but nevertheless we still think it can be interesting for exemplifying pur poses. Thus, now we are interested in associating to each crisp formula cp a fuzzy formula'\"'' which will be read as \"cp is NECESSARY\" or \"cp is CERTAIN\", in such a way that the truth-degree off\"' represents the necessity degree (in the sense of necessity measures) of cp, and therefore the truth degree of \u2022I \ufffdI(J represents the possibility degree of cp.\n4.4 Syntax of FPS. FPS-forrrmlas are jtL\"it FP formulas, i.e. formulas built from fuzzy propositional variables of the form /\"' using connnectives. Axioms of FPS are those of RPL (see section 3) plus: (FPS1) (fi(J, 1) for cp being an axiom of classical propo sitional logic, ( = (FP1)) (FPS2) (fi(J-+1/>--+ (fi(J--+ /11,), 1) for all cp, V', ( = (FP2)) (FPS3) (\u2022ftalse, 1), and (FPS4) ((fi(J /\\ /1/>) <-+ fi(JA1/'\u2022 1).\nNotice that, if we denote \u2022f\ufffdI(J by gi(J, we would get dual axioms corresponding to possibility measures, in particular (FPS1) and (FPS3) are also valid for propo sitional variables of type gi(J, and (FPS4) would be equivalently expressed as (FPS4') ((gi(J V g11,) <-+ 91(JV'I/'\u2022 1) Caution: Note that the obvious analogon of (FPS2) for possibilities is not sound. Analogous results to those for F P can be proved for FPS.\n4.5 Lemma. For any \"crisp\" formulas cp and '1/J we have: (1) If cp is a boolean tautology (i.e. provable in boolean propositional calcullL'>) then FPS proves /\"' in degree 1. (2) If cp is a boolean antitautology (i.e. \u2022cp is provable in boolean propositional calculus) then F P S proves \u2022fi(J in degree 1.\n(3) If cp --+1/J is a boolean tautology then FPS proves fi(J - /.p in degree 1. (4) If cp <-+ 1/J is a boolean tautology then FPS proves fi(J <-+ /.p in degree 1.\n4.6 Theorem. An evaluation e of atomic FPS formulas is a model of the theory F P S iff the map ping N defined on crisp formulas by N(cp) = e(fi(J) is a necessity measure on crisp formulas, i.e. N(True) = 1, N(False) = 0 and N(cp /\\ 1/J) = min(N(cp), N('lj;)).\nProof.\nWe only prove that if Nis a necessity on crisp formulas then the evaluation defined as e(/I(J) = N(cp) assigns 1 to axiom (FPS 2). The rest is straightforward. Thus, we have to prove that Nec(cp - 1/J) ::; (Nec(cp) - Nec('I/J)). By cases: - if N cc( cp) ::; N ec( 1/J) it is trivial. - suppose then that Nec(cp) > Nec('I/J). Since Ncc('I/J) = min(Nec('lj;Vcp), Nec('I/JV\u2022cp) and Nec('lj;V cp) \ufffd N ec( cp) > N ec( 1/J) the only possibility is that Ncc('I/J) = Nec('lj; V \u2022cp), and therefore (Nec(cp) - Nec('I/J)) \ufffd Nec('I/J) = Nec('I/J V \u2022cp), which ends the proof.D\n4. 7 Definition. A fuzzy theory T is stronger than F P S if for each formula <I> in the language of F P S, T(<I>) \ufffd FPS(<I>) (i.e. all the axioms (FPS 1); .. . (FPS 4) get the value 1 in T). A necessity function N on crisp formulas is a model ofT if the corresponding evaluation CN of atoms of FPS defined as eN(/I(J) = N(cp) is a model ofT.\nThe completeness result for FPS, analogous again to that for F P is given in the following theorem.\n4.8 Theorem. Let T be a fuzzy theory stronger than FPS. Then, for each FPS-formula <I>,\nI <I> lr= inf{eN(<I>) IN necessity, N model ofT}. In particular, for each crisp formula cp we have:\nI fi(J lr= inf{N(cp) I N necessity, N model ofT}.\nNotice that the well-known possibilistic resolution principle for necessity valued clauses, saying that from\n\"N(cp v 1/J) \ufffd o1\" and \"N(\u2022cp V x) \ufffd o2\"\nit can be inferrred\n\"N('I/J v x) \ufffd o1 \"o2\",\nis now a derivable inference rule in FPS. Namely, since [(cp v V')\" (\u2022cp v x)] - (1/J v x) is a boolean tau tology, by lemma 4.5(3), FPS proves !(I(JV1/I)A(\ufffdI(Jvx) !1/>vx with degree 1. By (FPS4), F P proves also (/\"'v\"' /\\ f\ufffdI(Jvx) - /.pvx with degree 1: \ufffdow the proof easily comes by modus ponens takmg mto ac count that the completeness of RP L allows us to\ninfer (f cpv.p 1\\ f \ufffdcpvx, a1 1\\ 012) from (f cpv.p, at ) and (f\ufffdcpvx, 012).\n5 Conclusions and open problems\nIn this paper we have been concerned about stress ing the conceptual differences between fuzzy logic and probability, and we have shown, as a main result, that both notions can be consistently used together to de fine a fuzzy theory F P in the Rational Pavelka's Logic (an extension of Lukasiewicz's logic with truth con stants and graded proofs) which is closely related to probability theory. The ba<>ic approach ha'> been: the probability of a crisp formula cp is understood a'> the truth degree of the fuzzy atomic proposition f cp saying that \"cp is probable\". ModeL'> of F P are in one-to-one relation to probabilities on the set of crisp formula'>; graded proofs of f cp in a fuzzy theory T containing F P give lower (and upper) bounds of P(cp) for all proba bilities P that are models ofT. This is hoped to con tribute to the understanding of the relation of fuzzy logic and probability. Moreover we have also sketched two interesting extensions of this approach. In the first one we show the possibility of dealing with conditional probabilities inside the same framework by extending Rational Pavelka's Logic with the product conjunc tion connective. In the second one we have shown the possibility of adapting the proposed approach to cope with other uncertainty calculi, in particular this ha'> been done for Possibility theory. Remaining issues to be addressed are, among others:\n- a more elegant way of representing conditional proba bilities by means of the product residuated implication and try to solve the problems related to the fact that this implication is not continuolL'> and hence does not admit a Pavelka-style completeness theorem;\n- axiomatization of a fuzzy theory related to belief functions. To this respect, it seem'> suitable to in troduce in the language some modalities if we want to avoid having very cumbersome axioms corresponding to the sub-additivity properties of belief functions.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research has been partially supported by the COPERNICUS project MUM (10053) from the Eu ropean Union.
