When a prior probability is available on the causal mechanisms gov\u00ad erning the domain, counterfactual probabil\u00ad ities can be evaluated precisely. However, when causal knowledge is specified as condi\u00ad tional probabilities on the observables, only bounds can computed. This paper develops techniques for evaluating these bounds, and demonstrates their use in two applications: (1) the determination of treatment efficacy from studies in which subjects may choose their own treatment, and (2) the determina\u00ad tion of liability in product-safety litigation.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
