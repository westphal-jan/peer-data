Specifically, we abstract a prob\u00ad abilistic belief network for diagnosing faults into a kappa network and compare the order\u00ad ing of faults computed using both methods. We show that, at least for the example exam\u00ad ined, the ordering of faults coincide as long as all the causal relations in the original prob\u00ad abilistic network are taken into account. We also provide a formal analysis of some net\u00ad work structures where the two methods will differ. Both kappa rankings and infinitesimal prob\u00ad abilities have been used extensively to study default reasoning and belief revision. But lit\u00ad tle has been done on utilizing their connec\u00ad tion as outlined above. This is partly be\u00ad cause the relation between kappa and prob\u00ad ability calculi assumes that probabilities are arbitrarily close to one (or zero). The exper\u00ad iments in this paper investigate this relation when this assumption is not satisfied. The reported results have important implications on the use of kappa rankings to enhance the knowledge engineering of uncertainty models.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
