By varying the granularity of the state spaces, one can trade off accuracy in the result for computational efficiency. We present an any\u00ad time procedure for approximate evaluation of probabilistic networks based on this idea. On application to some simple networks, the proce\u00ad dure exhibits a smooth improvement in approxi\u00ad mation quality as computation time increases. This suggests that state-space abstraction is one more useful control parameter for designing real\u00ad time probabilistic reasoners.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
