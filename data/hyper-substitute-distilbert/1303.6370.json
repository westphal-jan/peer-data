Although being successful in many application areas, the statistical performance of such approaches has been widely open. Moreover, the model selection problem can be highly challenging, especially for the so called Tucker model (Tucker, 1966; De Lathauwer et al., 2000), because we need to specify the rank rk for each mode (here a mode refers to one dimensionality of a tensor); that is, we have K hyper-parameters to choose for a K-way tensor, which is challenging even for K = 3.\nRecently a convex-optimization-based approach for tensor decomposition has been proposed by several authors (Signoretto et al., 2010; Gandy et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2009; Tomioka et al., 2011a), and its performance has been analyzed in (Tomioka et al., 2011b).\nThe basic idea behind their convex approach, which we call overlapped approach, is to unfold1 a tensor into matrices along different modes and penalize the un-\n1For a K-way tensor, there are K ways to unfold a tensor into a matrix.

The dashed lines show the minimum error over candidates of the regularization constant \u03bb from 0.1 to 100. In the inset, the errors of the two approaches are plotted against the regularization constant \u03bb for rank r = 40 (marked with gray dashed vertical line in the outset).

The convex approach does not require the rank of the decomposition to be specified beforehand, and due to the low-rank inducing property of the Schatten 1-norm, the rank of the decomposition is automatically determined.\nHowever, it has been noticed that the above overlapped approach has a limitation that it performs poorly for a tensor that is only low-rank in a certain mode (Tomioka et al., 2011a). They proposed an alternative approach, which we call latent approach, that decomposes a given tensor into a a mixture of tensors that each are low-rank in a specific mode; see the right panel of Figure 1. Figure 2 demonstrates that the latent approach is preferable to the overlapped approach when the underlying tensor is almost full rank in all but one mode.\nHowever, there are two issues that are not properly addressed so far.\nThe first issue is the statistical performance of the la-\ntent approach. In this paper, we show that the mean squared error of the latent approach scales no greater than the minimum mode-k rank of the underlying true tensor, which clearly explains why the latent approach suffers less than the overlapped approach in Figure 2.\nThe second issue is the identifiability of the model underlying the latent approach, i.e., a mixture of lowrank tensors. In this paper, we show that such a mixture is identifiable only when the mixture consists of one component; in other words, when the underlying tensor is low-rank in a specific mode.\nAlong the way, we show a novel duality between the two types of norms employed in the above two approaches, namely the overlapped Schatten norm and the latent Schatten norm. This result is closely related and generalize the results in structured sparsity literature (Bach et al., 2011; Jenatton et al., 2011; Obozinski et al., 2011; Maurer & Pontil, 2011). In fact, the (plain) overlapped group lasso constrains the weights to be simultaneously group sparse over overlapping groups. The latent group lasso predicts with a mixture of group sparse weights (see also Wright et al., 2010; Jalali et al., 2010; Agarwal et al., 2011). These approaches clearly correspond to the two variations of tensor decomposition algorithms we discussed above.\nFinally we empirically compare the overlapped approach and latent approach and show that even when the unknown tensor is simultaneously low-rank, which is a favorable situation for the overlapped approach, the latent approach performs better in many cases. Thus we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that for noisy tensor decomposition, the latent approach is preferable to the overlapped approach. Our result is complementary to the previous study (Tomioka et al., 2011a;b), which mainly focused on the noise-less tensor completion setting.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide basic definitions of the two variations of structured Schatten norms, namely the overlapped/latent Schatten norms, and discuss their properties, especially the duality between them. Section 3 presents our main theoretical contributions; we establish the consistency of the latent approach, we show a denoising performance bound, and discuss the identifiability of the model underlying it. In Section 4, we empirically confirm the scaling predicted by our theory. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.\n220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273\n275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329"}, {"heading": "2.

Now we are interested in the dual norm of the overlapped Sp/q-norm, because deriving the dual norm is a key step in solving the minimization problem that involves the norm (2) (see Mairal et al., 2011), as well as computing various complexity measures, such as, Rademacher complexity (Foygel & Srebro, 2011) and Gaussian width (Chandrasekaran et al., 2010). It turns out that the dual norm of the overlapped Sp/qnorm is the latent Sp\u2217/q\n\u2217-norm as shown in the following lemma.\nLemma 1. The dual norm of the overlapped Sp/qnorm is the latent Sp\u2217/q\n\u2217-norm, where 1/p+1/p\u2217 = 1 and 1/q + 1/q\u2217 = 1, which is defined as follows:\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223X \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nSp\u2217/q\u2217 = inf\n(X (1)+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+X (K))=X\n(\n\u2211K\nk=1 \u2016X(k)(k)\u2016 q\u2217 Sp\u2217\n)1/q\u2217\n.\n(4)\nHere the infimum is taken over the K-tuple of tensors X (1), . . . ,X (K) that sums to X .\nProof. The proof is presented in Appendix A.\nThe duality in the above lemma naturally generalizes the duality between overlapped/latent group sparsity norms that have only partial overlap (in contrast to the complete overlap here). Although being recognized in special instances (Jalali et al., 2010; Obozinski et al., 2011; Maurer & Pontil, 2011; Agarwal et al., 2011), to the best of our knowledge, this duality has not been presented in the generality of Lemma 1. Note that when the groups have no overlap, the overlapped/latent group sparsity norms become identical, and the duality is the ordinary duality between the group Sp/q-norms and the group Sp\u2217/q \u2217-norms."}, {"heading": "2.2.

The observation tensor Y is obtained by adding Gaussian noise with standard deviation \u03c3 = 0.1. There is no missing entries in this experiment.\nFor an observation Y, we computed tensor decompositions using the overlapped approach and the latent approach (11) using the solver available from the webpage2 of one of the authors of Tomioka et al. (2011a). The solver uses the alternating direction method of multipliers (Gabay &Mercier, 1976) and the algorithm is described in the above paper. We computed the solutions for 20 candidate regularization constants ranging from 0.1 to 100 and report the results for three representative values for each method.\nWe measured the quality of the solutions obtained by the two approaches by the mean squared error (MSE) \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\n\u2223W\u0302 \u2212 W\u2217 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 2\nF /N . In order to make our theoretical\npredictions more concrete, we define the quantities in the right hand side of the bounds (16) and (14) as Tucker rank (TR) complexity and Latent rank (LR) complexity, respectively, as follows:\nTR complexity = (\n1 K \u2211K k=1\n\u221a\n1 nk )2 ( 1 K \u2211K k=1 \u221a rk )2 ,\n(18)\nLR complexity = \u2211K k=1 r\u0304k nK , (19)\nwhere without loss of generality we assume n1 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 nK . We have ignored terms like \u221a\nnk/N because they are negligible for nk \u2248 50 and N \u2248 50, 000. The TR complexity is equivalent to the normalized rank in (Tomioka et al., 2011b). Note that the TR complexity (18) is defined in terms of the Tucker rank (r1, . . . , rK) of the truth W\u2217, whereas the LR complexity (19) is defined in terms of the latent rank (r1, . . . , rK) (see Section 3.2). In order to compute the sum of latent ranks \u2211K\nk=1 rk, we ran the latent approach to the true tensor W\u2217 without noise, and took the minimum of the sums obtained from that and the minimum rank singleton decomposition. The whole procedure is repeated 10 times and averaged.\nFigure 3 shows the results of the experiment. The left panel shows the MSE of the overlapped approach against the TR complexity (18). The middle panel shows the MSE of the latent approach against the LR\n2http://www.ibis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/RyotaTomioka/ Softwares/Tensor\ncomplexity (19). The right panel shows the improvement (i.e., MSE of the overlap approach divided by that of the latent approach) against the ratio of the respective complexity measures.\nFirst, from the left panel we can confirm that as predicted by (Tomioka et al., 2011b), the MSE of the overlapped approach scales linearly against the TR complexity (18) for each value of the regularization constant. We can also see that as predicted by Theorem 3, by scaling the regularization constant proportionally with \u221a\nN/nK , the series corresponding to size 50\u00d750\u00d720 and those corresponding to size 80\u00d780\u00d740 almost lie on top of each others.\nFrom the central panel, we can clearly see that the MSE of the latent approach scales linearly against the LR complexity (19) as predicted by Theorem 3. The series with \u25b3 (\u03bb = 3.79 for 50\u00d7 50\u00d7 20, \u03bb = 5.46 for 80\u00d780\u00d740) is mostly below other series, which means that the optimal choice of the regularization constant is independent of the rank of the true tensor and only depends on the size; this agrees with the condition on \u03bb in Theorem 3. Since the blue series and red series with the same markers lie on top of each other (especially the series with \u25b3 for which the optimal regularization constant is chosen), we can see that our theory predicts not only the scaling against the latent ranks but also that against the size of the tensor correctly. Note that the regularization constants are scaled by roughly 1.6 to account for the difference in the dimensionality.\nThe right panel reveals that in many cases the latent approach performs better than the overlapped approach, i.e., MSE (overlap)/ MSE (latent) greater than one. Moreover, we can see that the success of the latent approach relative to the overlapped approach is correlated with high TR complexity to LR complexity ratio. Indeed, we found that the optimal decomposition of the true tensorW\u2217 was typically a singleton decomposition corresponding to the smallest tucker rank (see Section 3.2).\nOne might think that we can fix the overlapped approach by allowing individual regularization constant for each mode.

Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have presented a framework for structured Schatten norms. The current framework includes both the overlapped Schatten 1-norm and latent Schatten 1-norm recently proposed in the context of convex-optimization-based tensor decomposition (Signoretto et al., 2010; Gandy et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2009; Tomioka et al., 2011a), and connects these studies to the broader studies on structured sparsity (Bach et al., 2011; Jenatton et al., 2011; Obozinski et al., 2011; Maurer & Pontil, 2011). Moreover, we have shown a duality that holds between the two types of norms.\nFurthermore, we have rigorously studied the performance of the latent approach for tensor decomposition. We have shown the consistency of the latent Schatten 1-norm minimization. Next, we have analyzed the denoising performance of the latent approach and shown that the error of the latent approach is upper bounded by the minimum Tucker rank, which contrasts sharply against the average (square root) dependency of the overlapped approach analyzed in Tomioka et al. (2011b). This explains the empirically observed superior performance of the latent approach compared to the overlapped approach. The most difficult case for the overlapped approach is when the unknown tensor is only low-rank in one mode as in Figure 2.\nWe have also confirmed through numerical simulations that our analysis precisely predicts the scaling of the mean squared error as a function of the dimensionalities and the latent rank of the unknown tensor. Unlike Tucker rank, latent rank of a tensor is not easy\nto compute. However, note that the theoretically optimal scaling of the regularization constant does not depend on the latent rank.\nTherefore we have theoretically and empirically shown that for noisy tensor decomposition, the latent approach is more likely to perform better than the overlapped approach. Analyzing the performance of the latent approach for tensor completion would be an important future work.\nThe structured Schatten norms proposed in this paper include norms for tensors that are not employed in practice yet. Therefore, we envision that this paper serve as a starting point for various extensions, e.g., using the overlapped S1/\u221e-norm instead of the S1/1-norm or a non-sparse tensor decomposition similar to the \u2113p-norm MKL (Micchelli & Pontil, 2005; Kloft et al., 2011)."}, {"heading": "A.
