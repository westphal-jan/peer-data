Unsupervised estimation of overcomplete representations has been hugely popular due to the availability of large-scale unlabeled samples in many applications.\nA probabilistic framework for incorporating features posits latent or hidden variables that can provide a good explanation to the observed data. Overcomplete probabilistic models can incorporate a much larger number of latent variables compared to the observed dimensionality. In this paper, we characterize the conditions under which overcomplete latent variable models can be identified from their observed moments.\nFor any parametric statistical model, identifiability is a fundamental question of whether the model parameters can be uniquely recovered given the observed statistics. Identifiability is crucial in a number of applications where the latent variables are the quantities of interest, e.g. inferring diseases (latent variables) through symptoms (observations), inferring communities (latent variables) via the interactions among the actors in a social network (observations), and so on. Moreover, identifiability can be relevant even in predictive settings, where feature learning is employed for some higher level task such as classification. For instance, non-identifiability can lead to the presence of non-isolated local optima for optimization-based learning methods, and this can affect their convergence properties, e.g. see [3].\nIn this paper, we characterize identifiability for a popular class of latent variable models, known as the admixture or topic models [4, 5]. These are hierarchical mixture models, which incorporate the presence of multiple latent states (i.e. topics) in each document consisting of a tuple of observed variables (i.e. words). Previous works have established that the model parameters can be estimated efficiently using low order observed moments (second and third order) under some non-degeneracy assumptions, e.g. [6\u20138]. However, these non-degeneracy conditions imply that the model is undercomplete, i.e., the latent dimensionality (number of topics) cannot exceed the observed dimensionality (word vocabulary size). In this paper, we remove this restriction and consider overcomplete topic models, where the number of topics can far exceed the word vocabulary size.\nIt is perhaps not surprising that general topic models are not identifiable in the overcomplete regime. To this end, we introduce an additional constraint on the model, referred to as topic persistence. Intuitively, this captures the \u201clocality\u201d effect among the observed words, and is not present in the usual \u201cbag-of-words\u201d or exchangeable topic model. Such local dependencies among observations abound in applications such as text, images and speech, and can lead to a more faithful representation. In addition, we establish that the presence of topic persistence is central towards obtaining model identifiability in the overcomplete regime, and we provide an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon in this paper."}, {"heading": "1.1 Summary of results", "text": "In this paper, we provide conditions for generic 1 model identifiability of overcomplete topic models given observable moments of a certain order (i.e., having a certain number of words in each doc-\n1A model is generically identifiable, if all the parameters in the parameter space are identifiable, almost surely. Refer to Definition 1 for more discussion.\nument). We introduce the notion of topic persistence, and analyze its effect on identifiability. We establish identifiability in the presence of a novel combinatorial object, referred to as perfect n-gram matching, in the bipartite graph from topics to words. Finally, we prove that random structured topic models satisfy these criteria, and are thus identifiable in the overcomplete regime.\nPersistent Topic Model: We first introduce the n-persistent topic model, where the parameter n determines the persistence level of a common topic in a sequence of n successive words. For instance, in Figure 1, the sequence of successive words x1, . . . , xn share a common topic y1, and similarly, the words xn+1, . . . , x2n share topic y2, and so on. The n-persistent model reduces to the popular \u201cbag-of-words\u201d model, when n = 1, and to the single topic model (i.e. only one topic in each document) when n \u2192 \u221e. Intuitively, topic persistence aids identifiability since we have multiple views of the common hidden topic generating a sequence of successive words. We establish that the bag-of-words model (with n = 1) is too non-informative about the topics in the overcomplete regime, and is therefore, not identifiable. On the other hand, n-persistent overcomplete topic models with n \u2265 2 can become identifiable, and we establish a set of transparent conditions for identifiability.\nDeterministic Conditions for Identifiability: Our sufficient conditions for identifiability are in the form of expansion conditions from the latent topic space to the observed word space. In the overcomplete regime, there are more topics than words in the vocabulary, and thus it is impossible to have expansion on the bipartite graph from topics to words, i.e., the graph encoding the sparsity pattern of the topic-word matrix. Instead, we impose an expansion constraint from topics to \u201chigher order\u201d words, which allows us to incorporate overcomplete models. We establish that this condition translates to the presence of a novel combinatorial object, referred to as the perfect n-gram matching, on the topic-word bipartite graph. Intuitively, the perfect n-gram matching condition implies \u201cdiversity\u201d among the higher-order word supports for different topics which leads to identifiability. In addition, we present trade-offs among the following quantities: number of topics, size of the word vocabulary, the topic persistence level, the order of the observed moments at hand, the minimum and maximum degrees of any topic in the topic-word bipartite graph, and the Kruskal rank [9] of the topic-word matrix, under which identifiability holds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide conditions for characterizing identifiability of overcomplete topic models with structured sparsity.\nIdentifiability of Random Structured Topic Models: We explicitly characterize the regime of identifiability for the random setting, where each topic i is randomly supported on a set of di words, i.e. the bipartite graph is a random graph. For this random model with q topics, pdimensional word vocabulary, and topic persistence level n, when q = O(pn) and \u0398(log p) \u2264 di \u2264 \u0398(p1/n), for all topics i, the topic-word matrix is identifiable from 2nth order observed moments with high probability. Intuitively, the upper bound on the degrees di is needed to limit the overlap of word supports among different topics in the overcomplete regime: as the number of topics q increases (i.e., n increases in the above degree bound), the degree needs to be correspondingly smaller to ensure identifiability, and we make this dependence explicit. Intuitively, as the extent of overcompleteness increases, we need sparser connections from topics to words to ensure sufficient diversity in the word supports among different topics. The lower bound on the degrees is required so that there are enough edges in the topic-word bipartite graph so that various topics can be distinguished from one another. Furthermore, we establish that the size condition q = O(pn) for identifiability is tight.\nImplications on Uniqueness of Overcomplete Tucker and CP Tensor Decompositions: We establish that identifiability of an overcomplete topic model is equivalent to uniqueness of decomposition of the observed moment tensor (of a certain order). Our identifiability results for persistent topic models imply uniqueness of a structured class of tensor decompositions, which is contained in the class of Tucker decompositions, but is more general than the candecomp/parafac (CP) decomposition [10]. This sub-class of Tucker decompositions involves structured sparsity and symmetry constraints on the core tensor, and sparsity constraints on the inverse factors of the Tucker decomposition. The structural constraints on the Tucker tensor decomposition are related to the topic model as follows: the sparsity and symmetry constraints on the core tensor are related to the persistence property of the topic model, and the sparsity constraints on the inverse factors are equivalent to the sparsity constraints on the topic-word matrix. For n-persistent topic model with n = 1 (bag-of-words model), the tensor decomposition is a general Tucker decomposition, where the core tensor is fully dense, while for n \u2192 \u221e (single-topic model), the tensor decomposition reduces to a CP decomposition, i.e. the core tensor is a diagonal tensor. For a finite persistence level n, in between these two extremes, the core tensor satisfies certain sparsity and symmetry constraints, which becomes crucial towards establishing identifiability in the overcomplete regime."}, {"heading": "1.2 Overview of Techniques", "text": "We now provide a short overview of the techniques employed in this paper.\nRecap of Identifiability Conditions in Under-complete Setting (Expansion Conditions on Topic-Word Matrix): Our approach is based on the recent results of [7], where conditions for identifiability of topic models are derived, given pairwise observed moments (specifically, cooccurrence of word-pairs in documents). Consider a topic model with q topics and observed word vocabulary of size p. Let A \u2208 Rp\u00d7q denote the topic-word matrix. Expansion conditions are imposed in [7] on the topic-word bipartite graph which imply that (generically) the sparsest vectors in the column span of A, denoted by Col(A), are the columns of A themselves. Thus the topic-word matrix\nA is identifiable from pairwise moments under expansion constraints. However, these expansion conditions constrain the model to be under-complete, i.e., the number of topics q \u2264 p, the size of the word vocabulary. Therefore, the techniques derived in [7] are not directly applicable here since we consider overcomplete models.\nIdentifiability in Overcomplete Setting and Why Topic-Persistence Helps: Pairwise moments are thus not sufficient for identifiability of overcomplete models, and the question is whether higher order moments can yield identifiability. We can view the higher order moments as pairwise moments of another equivalent topic model, which enables us to apply the techniques of [7]. The key question is whether we have expansion in the equivalent topic model, which implies identifiability. For a general topic model (without any topic persistence constraints), it can be shown that for identifiability, we require expansion of the nth-order Kronecker product of the original topic-word matrix A, denoted by A\u2297n \u2208 Rp\nn\u00d7qn , when given access to (2n)th-order moments, for any integer n \u2265 1. In the overcomplete regime where q > p, A\u2297n cannot expand, and therefore, overcomplete models are not identifiable in general. On the other hand, we show that imposing the constraint of topic persistence can lead to identifiability. For a n-persistent topic model, given (2n)th-order moments, we establish that identifiability occurs when the nth-order Khatri-Rao product of A, denoted by A\u2299n \u2208 Rp\nn\u00d7q, expands. Note that the Khatri-Rao product A\u2299n is a sub-matrix of the Kronecker product A\u2297n, and the Khatri-Rao product A\u2299n can expand as long as q \u2264 pn. Thus, the property of topic persistence is central towards achieving identifiability in the overcomplete regime.\nFirst-Order Approach for Identifiability of Overcomplete Models (Expansion of ngram Topic-Word Matrix): We refer to A\u2299n \u2208 Rp\nn\u00d7q as the n-gram topic-word matrix, and intuitively, it relates topics to n-tuple words. Imposing the expansion conditions derived in [7] on A\u2299n implies that (generically) the sparsest vectors in Col(A\u2299n), are the columns of A\u2299n themselves. Thus, the topic-word matrix A is identifiable from (2n)th-order moments for a n-persistent topic model. We refer to this as the \u201cfirst-order\u201d approach since we directly impose the expansion conditions of [7] on A\u2299n, without exploiting the additional structure present in A\u2299n.\nWhy the First-Order Approach is not Enough: Note that A\u2299n \u2208 Rp n\u00d7q matrix relates topics to n-tuples of words. Thus, the entries of A\u2299n are highly correlated, even if the original topic-word matrix A is assumed to be randomly generated. It is non-trivial to derive conditions on A, so that A\u2299n expands. Moreover, we establish that A\u2299n fails to expand on \u201csmall\u201d sets, as required in [7], when the degrees are sufficiently different 2. Thus, the first-order approach is highly restrictive in the overcomplete setting.\n2For A\u2299n to expand on a set of size s \u2265 2, it is necessary that s \u00b7 ( dmin+n\u22121\nn\n) \u2265 s + ( dmax+n\u22121\nn\n) , where dmin and\ndmax are the minimum and maximum degrees, and n is the extent of overcompleteness: q = \u0398(p n). When the model is highly overcomplete (large n) and we require small set expansion (small s), the degrees need to be nearly the same. Thus, it is desirable to impose expansion only on large sets, since it allows for more degree diversity.\nIncorporating Rank Criterion: Note that A\u2299n is highly structured: the columns of A\u2299n matrix possess a tensor 3 rank of 1, when n > 1. This can be incorporated in our identifiability criteria as follows: we provide conditions under which the sparsest vectors in Col(A\u2299n), which also possess a tensor rank of 1, are the columns of A\u2299n themselves. This implies identifiability of a npersistent topic model, when given access to (2n)th-order moments. Note that when a small number of columns of A\u2299n are combined, the resulting vector cannot possess a tensor rank of 1, and thus, we can rule out that such sparse combinations of columns using the rank criterion. The maximum such number is at least the Kruskal rank 4 of A. Thus, sparse combinations of columns of A (up to the Kruskal rank) can be ruled out using the rank criterion, and we require expansion on A\u2299n only on large sets of topics (of size larger than the Kruskal rank). This agrees with the intuition that when the topic-word matrix A has a larger Kruskal rank, it should be easier to identify A, since the Kruskal rank is related to the mutual incoherence 5 among the columns of A, see [11].\nNotion of Perfect n-gram Matching and Final Identifiability Conditions: Thus, we establish identifiability of overcomplete topic models subject to expansion conditions A\u2299n on sets of size larger than the Kruskal rank of the topic-word matrix A. However, it is desirable to impose transparent and interpretable conditions directly on A for identifiability. We introduce the notion of perfect n-gram matching on the topic-word bipartite graph, which ensures that each topic can be uniquely matched to a n-tuple word. This combined with a lower bound on the Kruskal rank provides the final set of deterministic conditions for identifiability of the overcomplete topic model. Intuitively, we require that the columns of A be sparse, while still maintaining a large enough Kruskal rank; in other words, the topics have to be sparse and have sufficiently diverse word supports. Thus, we establish identifiability under a set of transparent conditions on the topic-word matrix A, consisting of perfect n-gram matching condition and a lower bound on the Kruskal rank of A.\nAnalysis under Random-Structured Topic-Word Matrices: Finally, we establish that the derived deterministic conditions are satisfied when the topic-word bipartite graph is randomly generated, as long as the degrees satisfy certain lower and upper bounds. Intuitively, a lower bound on the degrees of the topics is required to have degree concentration on various subsets so that expansion can occur, while the upper bound is required so that the Kruskal rank of the topic-word matrix is large enough compared to the sparsity level. Here, the main technical result is establishing the presence of a perfect n-gram matching in a random bipartite graph with a wide range of degrees. We present a greedy and a recursive mechanism for constructing such a n-gram matching for overcomplete models, which can be relevant even in other settings. For instance, our results imply the presence of a perfect matching when the edges of a bipartite graph are correlated in a structured manner, as given by the Khatri-Rao product.\n3When any column of A\u2299n \u2208 Rp n\u00d7q (of length pn) is reshaped as a nth-order tensor T \u2208 Rp\u00d7p\u00d7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00d7p, the tensor T is rank 1. 4The Kruskal rank is the maximum number k such that every k-subset of columns of A are linearly independent. Note that the Kruskal rank is equal to the rank of A, when A has full column rank. But this cannot happen in the overcomplete setting.\n5It is easy to show that krank \u2265 (maxi6=j |a \u22a4 i aj |) \u22121, where ai, aj are any pair of columns of A. Thus, higher incoherence leads to a larger kruskal rank."}, {"heading": "1.3 Related works", "text": "We now summarize some recent related works in the area of identifiability and learning of latent variable models.\nIdentifiability, learning and applications of overcomplete latent representations: Many recent works employ unsupervised estimation of overcomplete features for higher level tasks such classification, e.g. [1,12\u201314], and record huge gains over other approaches in a number of applications such as speech recognition and computer vision. However, theoretical understanding regarding learnability or identifiability of overcomplete representations is far more limited.\nOvercomplete latent representations have been analyzed in the context of the independent components analysis (ICA), where the sources are assumed to be independent, and the mixing matrix is unknown. In the overcomplete or under-determined regime of the ICA, there are more sources than sensors. Identifiability and learning of the overcomplete ICA reduces to the problem of finding an overcomplete candecomp/parafac (CP) tensor decomposition. The classical result by Kruskal provides conditions for uniqueness of a CP decomposition [9, 15], with recent extensions to the notion of robust identifiability [16]. These results provide conditions for strict identifiability of the model, and here, the dimensionality of the latent space is required to be of the same order as the observed space dimensionality. In contrast, a number of recent works analyze generic identifiability of overcomplete CP decomposition, which is weaker than strict identifiability, e.g. [17\u201323]. These works assume that the factors (i.e. the components) of the CP decomposition are generically drawn and provide conditions for uniqueness. They allow for the latent dimensionality to be much larger (polynomially larger) than the observed dimensionality. These results on the uniqueness of CP decompositions also lead to identifiability of other latent variable models, such as latent tree models, e.g. [24, 25], and the single-topic model, or more generally latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Recently Goyal et. al. [26] proposed an alternative framework for overcomplete ICA models based on the eigen-decomposition of the reweighted covariance matrix (or higher order moments), where the weights are the Fourier coefficients. However, their approach requires independence of sources (i.e. latent topics in our context), which is not imposed here.\nIn contrast to the above works dealing with the CP tensor decomposition, we require uniqueness for a more general class of tensor decompositions, in order to establish identifiability of topic models with arbitrarily correlated topics. We establish that our class of tensor decomposition is contained in the class of Tucker decompositions which is more general than CP decomposition. Moreover, we explicitly characterize the effect of the sparsity pattern of the factors (i.e., the topic-word matrix) on model identifiability, while all the previous works based on generic identifiability assume fully dense factors (since sparse factors are not generic). For a general overview of tensor decompositions, see [10,27].\nIdentifiability and learning of undercomplete/over-determined latent representations: Much of the theoretical results on identifiability and learning of the latent variable models are limited to non-singular models, which implies that the latent space dimensionality is at most the observed dimensionality. We outline some of the recent works below.\nThe works of Anandkumar et. al. [6,28,29] provide an efficient moment-based approach for learning topic models, under constraints on the distribution of the topic proportions, e.g. the single topic model, and more generally latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). In addition, the approach can handle a variety of latent variable models such as Gaussian mixtures, hidden Markov models (HMM) and community models [30]. The high-level idea is to reduce the problem of learning of the latent variable model to finding a CP decomposition of the (suitably adjusted) observed moment tensor. Various approaches can then be employed to find the CP decomposition. In [6], a tensor power method approach is analyzed and is shown to be an efficient guaranteed recovery method in the nondegenerate (i.e. undercomplete) setting. Previously, simultaneous diagonalization techniques have been employed for solving the CP decomposition, e.g. [28, 31, 32]. However, these techniques fail when the model is overcomplete, as considered here. We note that some recent techniques, e.g. [20], can be employed instead, albeit at a cost of higher computational complexity for overcomplete CP tensor decomposition. However, it is not clear how the sparsity constraints affect the guarantees of such methods. Moreover, these approaches cannot handle general topic models, where the distribution of the topic proportions is not limited to these classes (i.e. either single topic or Dirichlet distribution), and we require tensor decompositions which are more general than the CP decomposition.\nThere are many other works which consider learning mixture models when multiple views are available. See [28] for a detailed description of these works. Recently, Rabani et. al. [33] consider learning discrete mixtures given a large number of \u201cviews\u201d, and they refer to the number of views as the sampling aperture. They establish improved recovery results (in terms of \u21131 bounds) when sufficient number of views are available (2k \u2212 1 views for a k-component mixture). However, their results are limited to discrete mixtures or single-topic models, while our setting can handle more general topic models. Moreover, our approach is different since we incorporate sparsity constraints in the topic-word distribution. Another series of recent works by Arora et. al. [8, 34] employ approaches based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to recover the topic-word matrix. These works allow models with arbitrarily correlated topics, as considered here. They establish guaranteed learning when every topic has an anchor word, i.e. the word is uniquely generated from that topic, and does not occur under any other topic. Note that the anchor-word assumption cannot be satisfied in the overcomplete setting.\nOur work is closely related to the work of Anandkumar et. al. [7] which considers identifiability and learning of topic models under expansion conditions on the topic-word matrix. The work of Spielman et. al [35] considers the problem of dictionary learning, which is closely related to the setting of [7], but in addition assumes that the coefficient matrix is random. However, these works [7,35] can handle only the under-complete setting, where the number of topics is less than the dimensionality of the word vocabulary (or the number of dictionary atoms is less than the number of observations in [35]). We extend these results to the overcomplete setting by proposing novel higher order expansion conditions on the topic-word matrix, and also incorporate additional rank constraints present in higher order moments.\nDictionary learning/sparse coding: Overcomplete representations have been very popular in the context of dictionary learning or sparse coding. Here, the task is to jointly learn a dictionary as well as a sparse selection of the dictionary atoms to fit the observed data. There have been Bayesian as well as frequentist approaches for dictionary learning [2,36,37]. However, the heuristics\nemployed in these works [2, 36, 37] have no performance guarantees. The work of Spielman et. al [35] considers learning (undercomplete) dictionaries and provide guaranteed learning under the assumption that the coefficient matrix is random (distributed as Bernoulli-Gaussian variables). Recent works [38, 39] provide generalization bounds for predictive sparse coding, where the goal of the learned representation is to obtain good performance on some predictive task. This differs from our framework since we do not consider predictive tasks here, but the task of recovering the underlying latent representation. Hillar and Sommer [40] consider the problem of identifiability of sparse coding and establish that when the dictionary succeeds in reconstructing a certain set of sparse vectors, then there exists a unique sparse coding, up to permutation and scaling. However, our setting here is different, since we do not assume that a sparse set of topics occur in each document."}, {"heading": "2 Model", "text": "Notation: The set {1, 2, . . . , n} is denoted by [n] := {1, 2, . . . , n}.

For notational purposes, we equivalently assume that variables yj, j \u2208 [2r], are encoded by the basis vectors ei, i \u2208 [q].

In this paper, we consider the problem of identifiability when exact moments are available. The moment characterization of the n-persistent topic model is provided in Lemma 1 in Section 4.1. Given M (n) 2rn(x), what are the sufficient conditions under which the population structure A is identifiable? This is answered in Section 3. Remark 1.

Furthermore, the observed random variables xl, can be continuous while the hidden ones yj are assumed to be discrete."}, {"heading": "3 Sufficient Conditions for Generic Identifiability", "text": "In this section, the identifiability result for the n-persistent topic model with access to (2n)-th order observed moment is provided. First, sufficient deterministic conditions on the population structure A are provided for identifiability in Theorem 1. Next, the deterministic analysis is specialized to a random structured model in Theorem 2.\nWe now make the notion of identifiability precise. As defined in literature, (strict) identifiability means that the population structure A can be uniquely recovered up to permutation and scaling for all A \u2208 Rp\u00d7q. Instead, we consider a more relaxed notion of identifiability, known as generic identifiability. Definition 1 (Generic identifiability). We refer to a matrix A \u2208 Rp\u00d7q as generic, with a fixed sparsity pattern when the nonzero entries of A are drawn from a distribution which is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure 7. For a given sparsity pattern, the class of population structure matrices is said to be generically identifiable [25], if all the non-identifiable matrices form a set of Lebesgue measure zero.\nThe (2r)-th order moment of hidden variables h \u2208 Rq, denoted by M2r(h) \u2208 R qr\u00d7qr , is defined as\nM2r(h) := E\n[( r times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 h\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 h )( r times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 h\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 h )\u22a4] \u2208 Rq r\u00d7qr . (3)\nWe now provide a set of sufficient conditions for generic identifiability of structured topic models given (2rn)-th order observed moment. We first start with a natural assumption on the hidden variables. Condition 1 (Non-degeneracy). The (2r)-th order moment of hidden variables h \u2208 Rq, defined in equation (3), is full rank (non-degeneracy of hidden nodes).\nNote that there is no hope of distinguishing distinct hidden nodes without this non-degeneracy assumption. We do not impose any other assumption on hidden variables and can incorporate arbitrarily correlated topics.\n7As an equivalent definition, if the non-zero entries of an arbitrary sparse matrix are independently perturbed with noise drawn from a continuous distribution to generate A, then A is called generic.\nFurthermore, we can only hope to identify the population structureA up to scaling and permutation. Therefore, we can identify A up to a canonical form defined as: Definition 2 (Canonical form). Population structure A is said to be in canonical form if all of its columns have unit norm."}, {"heading": "3.1 Deterministic conditions for generic identifiability", "text": "In this section, we consider a fixed sparsity pattern on the population structure A and establish generic identifiability when non-zero entries of A are drawn from some continuous distribution. Before providing the main result, a generalized notion of (perfect) matching for bipartite graphs is defined. We subsequently impose these conditions on the bipartite graph from topics to words which encodes the sparsity pattern of population structure A.\nGeneralized matching for bipartite graphs\nA bipartite graph with two disjoint vertex sets Y and X and an edge set E between them is denoted by G(Y,X;E). Given the bi-adjacency matrix A, the notation G(Y,X;A) is also used to denote a bipartite graph. Here, the rows and columns of matrix A \u2208 R|X|\u00d7|Y | are respectively indexed by X and Y vertex sets. For any subset S \u2286 Y , the set of neighbors of vertices in S with respect to A is defined as NA(S) := {i \u2208 X : Aij 6= 0 for some j \u2208 S}, or equivalently, NE(S) := {i \u2208 X : (j, i) \u2208 E for some j \u2208 S} with respect to edge set E.\nHere, we define a generalized notion of matching for a bipartite graph and refer to it as n-gram matching. Definition 3 ((Perfect) n-gram matching). A n-gram matching M for a bipartite graph G(Y,X;E) is a subset of edges M \u2286 E which satisfies the following conditions. First, for any j \u2208 Y , we have |NM (j)| \u2264 n. Second, for any j1, j2 \u2208 Y, j1 6= j2, we have min{|NM (j1)|, |NM (j2)|} > |NM (j1) \u2229NM (j2)|. A perfect n-gram matching or Y -saturating n-gram matching for the bipartite graph G(Y,X;E) is a n-gram matching M in which each vertex in Y is the end-point of exactly n edges in M .\nIn words, in a n-gram matching M , each vertex j \u2208 Y is at most the end-point of n edges in M and for any pair of vertices in Y (j1, j2 \u2208 Y, j1 6= j2), there exists at least one non-common neighbor in set X for each of them (j1 and j2).\nAs an example, a bipartite graph G(Y,X;E) with |X| = 4 and |Y | = 6 is shown in Figure 2 for which the edge set E itself is a perfect 2-gram matching.\nRemark 2 (Relationship to other matchings). The relationship of n-gram matching to other types of matchings is discussed below.\n\u2022 Regular matching: For special case n = 1, the (perfect) n-gram matching reduces to the usual (perfect) matching for bipartite graphs.\n\u2022 b-matching: A b-matching for a bipartite graph G(Y,X;E) (with equal vertex sizes |X| = |Y |) is a subset of edges Mb \u2286 E, where each vertex is connected to b edges. Comparing with the proposed perfect n-gram matching, b-matching does not enforce that the set of neighbors be different, and furthermore, it requires that X = Y , which is not possible under the overcomplete setting. Remark 3 (Necessary size bound). Consider a bipartite graph G(Y,X;E) with |Y | = q and |X| = p which has a perfect n-gram matching. Note that there are (p n ) n-combinations on X side and each combination can at most have one neighbor (a node in Y which is connected to all nodes in the combination) through the matching, and therefore we necessarily have q \u2264 (p n ) .\nFinally, note that the existence of perfect n-gram matching results the existence of perfect (n+1)gram matching 8, but the reverse is not true. For example, the bipartite graph G(Y,X;E) with |X| = 4 and |Y | = (4 2 ) = 6 in Figure 2, has a perfect 2-gram matching, but not a perfect (1-gram) matching (since 6 > 4).\nIdentifiability conditions based on existence of perfect n-gram matching in topic-word graph\nNow, we are ready to propose the identifiability conditions and result. Condition 2 (Perfect n-gram matching on A). The bipartite graph G(Vh, Vo;A) between hidden and observed variables, has a perfect n-gram matching.\nThe above condition implies that the sparsity pattern of matrix A is appropriately scattered in the mapping from hidden to observed variables to be identifiable. Intuitively, it means that every hidden node can be distinguished from another hidden node by its unique set of neighbors under the corresponding n-gram matching. Furthermore, condition 2 is the key to be able to propose identifiability in the overcomplete regime. As stated in the size bound in Remark 3, for n \u2265 2, the number of hidden variables can be more than the number of observed variables and we can still have perfect n-gram matching. Definition 4 (Kruskal rank, [15]). The Kruskal rank or the krank of matrix A is defined as the maximum number k such that every subset of k columns of A is linearly independent.\nNote that krank is different from the general notion of matrix rank and it is a lower bound for the matrix rank, i.e., Rank(A) \u2265 krank(A). Condition 3 (Krank condition on A). The Kruskal rank of matrix A satisfies the bound krank(A) \u2265 dmax(A) n, where dmax(A) is the maximum node degree of any column of A.\nIn the overcomplete regime, it is not possible for A to be full column rank and krank(A) < |Vh| = q. However, note that a large enough krank ensures that appropriate sized subsets of columns of A are linearly independent. For instance, when krank(A) > 1, any two columns cannot be collinear\n8Note that the degree of each node (on matching side Y ) in the original bipartite graph should be at least n+ 1.\nand the above condition rules out the collinear case for identifiability. In the above condition, we see that a larger krank can incorporate denser connections between topics and words.\nThe main identifiability result under a fixed graph structure is stated in the following theorem for n \u2265 2, where n is the topic persistence level. The identifiability result relies on having access to the (2rn)-th order moment of observed variables xl, l \u2208 [2rn], defined in equation (2) as\nM2rn(x) := E [ (x1 \u2297 x2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 xrn)(xrn+1 \u2297 xrn+2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 x2rn) \u22a4 ] \u2208 Rp rn\u00d7prn ,\nfor some integer r \u2265 1. Theorem 1 (Generic identifiability under deterministic topic-word graph structure). Let M (n) 2rn(x) in equation (2) be the (2rn)-th order observed moment of the n-persistent topic model for some integer r \u2265 1. If the model satisfies conditions 1, 2 and 3, then, for any n \u2265 2, all the columns of population structure A are generically identifiable from M (n) 2rn(x). Furthermore, the (2r)-th order moment of the hidden variables, denoted by M2r(h), is also generically identifiable.\nThe theorem is proved in Appendix A. It is seen that the population structure A is identifiable, given any observed moment of order at least 2n. Increasing the order of observed moment results in identifying higher order moments of the hidden variables. The above theorem does not cover the case when the persistence level n = 1. This is the usual bag-of-words admixture model. Identifiability of this model has been studied earlier [7] and we recall it below. Remark 4 (Bag-of-words admixture model, [7]). Given (2r)-th order observed moments with r \u2265 1, the structure of the popular bag-of-words admixture model and the (2r)-th order moment of hidden variables are identifiable, when A is full column rank and the following expansion condition holds [7]\n|NA(S)| \u2265 |S|+ dmax(A), \u2200S \u2286 Vh, |S| \u2265 2. (4)\nOur result for n \u2265 2 in Theorem 1, provides identifiability in the overcomplete regime with weaker matching condition 2 and krank condition 3. The matching condition 2 is weaker than the above expansion condition which is based on the perfect matching and hence, does not allow overcomplete models. Furthermore, the above result for the bag-of-words admixture model requires full column rank of A which is more stringent than our krank condition 3. Remark 5 (Kruskal rank and degree diversity). Condition 3 requires that the Kruskal rank of the topic-word matrix be large enough compared to the maximum degree of the topics. Intuitively, a larger Kruskal rank ensures enough diversity in the word supports among different topics under a higher level of sparsity. This Kruskal rank condition also allows for more degree diversity among the topics, when the topic persistence level n > 1. On the other hand, for the bag-of-words model (n = 1), using (4) implies that 2dmin > dmax, where dmin, dmax are the minimum and maximum degrees of the topics. Thus, we provide identifiability results with more degree diversity when higher order moments are employed. Remark 6 (Recovery using \u21131 optimization). It turns out that our conditions for identifiability imply that the columns of the n-gram matrix A\u2299n, defined in Definition 6, are the sparsest vectors in\nCol ( M\n(n) 2n (x)\n) , having a tensor rank of one. See Appendix A. This implies recovery of the columns\nof A through exhaustive search, which is not efficient. Efficient \u21131-based recovery algorithms have been analyzed in [7,43] for the undercomplete case (n = 1). They can be employed here for recovery from higher order moments as well. Exploiting additional structure present in A\u2299n, for n > 1, such as rank-1 test devices proposed in [20] are interesting avenues for future investigation."}, {"heading": "3.2 Analysis under random topic-word graph structures", "text": "In this section, we specialize the identifiability result to the random case. This result is based on more transparent conditions on the size and the degree of the random bipartite graph G(Vh, Vo;A). We consider the random model where in the bipartite graph G(Vh, Vo;A), each node i \u2208 Vh is randomly connected to di different nodes in set Vo. Note that this is a heterogeneous degree model. Condition 4 (Size condition). The random bipartite graph G(Vh, Vo;A) with |Vh| = q, |Vo| = p, and A \u2208 Rp\u00d7q, satisfies the size condition q \u2264 ( c pn )n for some constant 0 < c < 1.\nThis size condition is required to establish that the random bipartite graph has a perfect n-gram matching (and hence satisfies deterministic condition 2). It is shown in Section 5.2.1 that the necessary size constraint q = O(pn) stated in Remark 3, is achieved in the random case. Thus, the above constraint allows for the overcomplete regime, where q \u226b p for n \u2265 2, and is tight. Condition 5 (Degree condition). In the random bipartite graph G(Vh, Vo;A) with |Vh| = q, |Vo| = p, and A \u2208 Rp\u00d7q, the degree di of nodes i \u2208 Vh satisfies the following lower and upper bounds (di \u2208 [dmin, dmax]):\n\u2022 Lower bound: dmin \u2265 max{1+\u03b2 log p, \u03b1 log p} for some constants \u03b2 > n\u22121 log 1/c , \u03b1 > max { 2n2 ( \u03b2 log 1c+\n1 ) , 2\u03b2n } .\n\u2022 Upper bound: dmax \u2264 (cp) 1 n .\nIntuitively, the lower bound on the degree is required to show that the corresponding bipartite graph G(Vh, Vo;A) has sufficient number of random edges to ensure that it has perfect n-gram matching with high probability. The upper bound on the degree is mainly required to satisfy the krank condition 3, where dmax(A) n \u2264 krank(A).\nIt is important to see that, for n \u2265 2, the above condition on degree covers a range of models from sparse to intermediate regimes and it is reasonable in a number of applications that each topic does not generate a very large number of words. Definition 5 (whp). A sequence of events Ep occurs with high probability (whp) if Pr(Ep) = 1\u2212O(p\u2212\u01eb) for some \u01eb > 0.\nThe main random identifiability result is stated in the following theorem for n \u2265 2, while n = 1 case is addressed in Remark 8. The identifiability result relies on having access to the (2rn)-th order moment of observed variables xl, l \u2208 [2rn], defined in equation (2) as\nM2rn(x) := E [ (x1 \u2297 x2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 xrn)(xrn+1 \u2297 xrn+2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 x2rn) \u22a4 ] \u2208 Rp rn\u00d7prn ,\nfor some integer r \u2265 1.\nProbability rate constants: The probability rate of success in the following random identifiability result is specified by constants \u03b2\u2032 > 0 and \u03b3 = \u03b31 + \u03b32 > 0 as\n\u03b2\u2032 = \u2212\u03b2 log c\u2212 n+ 1, (5)\n\u03b31 = e n\u22121 ( c nn\u22121 + e2 1\u2212 \u03b41 n\u03b2 \u2032+1 ) , (6)\n\u03b32 = cn\u22121e2\nnn(1\u2212 \u03b42) , (7)\nwhere \u03b41 and \u03b42 are some constants satisfying e 2 ( p n )\u2212\u03b2 log 1/c < \u03b41 < 1 and cn\u22121e2 nn p \u2212\u03b2\u2032 < \u03b42 < 1. Theorem 2 (Random identifiability). Let M\n(n) 2rn(x) in equation (2) be the (2rn)-th order observed\nmoment of the n-persistent topic model for some integer r \u2265 1. If the model with random population structure A satisfies conditions 1, 4 and 5, then whp (with probability at least 1\u2212\u03b3p\u2212\u03b2 \u2032 for constants \u03b2\u2032 > 0 and \u03b3 > 0, specified in (5)-(7)), for any n \u2265 2, all the columns of population structure A are identifiable from M (n) 2rn(x). Furthermore, the (2r)-th order moment of hidden variables, denoted by M2r(h), is also identifiable, whp.\nThe theorem is proved in Appendix B. Similar to the deterministic analysis, it is seen that the population structure A is identifiable given any observed moment with order at least 2n. Increasing the order of observed moment results in identifying higher order moments of the hidden variables.\nRemark 7 (Trade-off between topic-word size ratio and degree). When the number of hidden variables increases, i.e. c increases, but the order n is kept fixed, the bounds on degree in condition 5 also needs to grow. Intuitively, a larger degree is needed to provide more flexibility in choosing the subsets of neighbors for hidden nodes to ensure the existence of a perfect n-gram matching in the bipartite graph, which in turn ensures identifiability. Note that as c grows, the parameter \u03b2, which is the lower bound on d also grows, and the probability rate (i.e., the term \u2212\u03b2 log c) remains constant. Hence, the probability rate does not change as c increases, since the increase in the degree d compensates the additional \u201cdifficulty\u201d arising due to a larger number of hidden variables.\nThe above identifiability theorem only covers for n \u2265 2 and the n = 1 case is addressed in the following remark. Remark 8 (Bag-of-words admixture model). The identifiability result for the random bag-of-words admixture model is comparable to the result in [43], which considers exact recovery of sparsely-used dictionaries. They assume that Y = DX is given for some unknown arbitrary dictionary D \u2208 Rq\u00d7q and unknown random sparse coefficient matrix X \u2208 Rq\u00d7p. They establish that if D \u2208 Rq\u00d7q is full rank and the random sparse coefficient matrix X \u2208 Rq\u00d7p follows the Bernoulli-subgaussian model with size constraint p > Cq log q and degree constraint O(log q) < E[d] < O(q log q), then the model is identifiable, whp. Comparing the size and degree constraints, our identifiability result for n \u2265 2 requires more stringent upper bound on the degree (d = O(p1/n)), while more relaxed condition on the size (q = O(pn)) which allows to identifiability in the overcomplete regime. Remark 9 (The size condition is tight). The size bound q = O(pn) in the above theorem achieves the necessary condition that q \u2264 ( p n ) = O(pn) (see Remark 3), and is therefore tight. The sufficiency is argued in Theorem 3, where we show that the matching condition 2 holds under the above size and degree conditions 4 and 5."}, {"heading": "4 Identifiability via Uniqueness of Tensor Decompositions", "text": "In this section, we characterize the moments of the n-persistent topic model in terms of the model parameters, i.e. the topic-word matrix A and the moment of hidden variables.

Throughout this section, the order of the observed moment is fixed to 2m. Lemma 1 (n-persistent topic model moment characterization). The (2m)-th order moment of observed variables, defined in equation (2), for the n-persistent topic model is characterized as 9:\n\u2022 if m = rn, for some integer r \u2265 1, then\nM (n) 2m (x) =\n( r times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 A\u2299n \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297A\u2299n ) M2r(h) ( r times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 A\u2299n \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297A\u2299n )\u22a4 , (8)\nwhere M2r(h) \u2208 R qr\u00d7qr is the (2r)-th order moment of hidden variables h \u2208 Rq, defined in equation (3).\n\u2022 If n \u2265 2m, then\nM (n) 2m (x) =\n( A\u2299m ) M1(h) ( A\u2299m )\u22a4 , (9)\nwhere M1(h) := Diag(E[h]) \u2208 R q\u00d7q is the first order moment of hidden variables h \u2208 Rq, stacked in a diagonal matrix.\nThus, we see that the observed moments can be expressed in terms of the hidden moments M(h) and the Kronecker products of the n-gram matrices. In the special case, when the persistence level is large enough compared to the order of the moment (n \u2265 2m), the moment form reduces to a Khatri-Rao product form in (9). Moreover, in (9), we have a diagonal matrix M1(h) instead of a general (dense) matrix M2r(h) in (8), when n < 2m = 2rn.

Note that M2m(h) is a full matrix in general.\nContrasting single topic (n \u2192 \u221e) and bag of words models (n = 1): Comparing equations (10) and (11), it is seen that the moments under the single topic model in (10) are more \u201cstructured\u201d compared to the bag of words model in (11). In (11), we have Kronecker products of the topicword matrix A, while (10) involves Khatri-Rao products of A. This forms a crucial criterion in determining of whether overcomplete models are identifiable, as discussed below.\nWhy persistence helps in identifiability of overcomplete models? For simplicity, let the order of the moment 2m = 4. The equations (10) and (11) reduce to\nM (\u221e) 4 (x) = (A\u2299A)Diag\n( E [ h] ) (A\u2299A)\u22a4, (12)\nM (1) 4 (x) = (A\u2297A)E\n[ (h\u2297 h)(h\u2297 h)\u22a4 ] (A\u2297A)\u22a4. (13)\nNote that for the single topic model in (12), the Khatri-Rao product matrix A \u2299 A \u2208 Rp 2\u00d7q has the same as the number of columns (i.e. the latent dimensionality) of the original matrix A, while the number of rows (i.e. the observed dimensionality) is increased. Thus, the Khatri-Rao product\n\u201cexpands\u201d the effect of hidden variables to higher order observed variables, which is the key towards identifying overcomplete models. In other words, the original overcomplete representation becomes determined due to the \u2018expansion effect\u2019 of the Khatri-Rao product structure of the higher order observed moments.\nOn the other hand, in the bag-of-words admixture model in (13), this interesting \u2018expansion property\u2019 does not occur, and we have the Kronecker product A\u2297A \u2208 Rp\n2\u00d7q2 , in place of the Khatri-Rao products. The Kronecker product operation increases both the number of the columns (i.e. latent dimensionality) and the number of rows (i.e. observed dimensionality), which implies that higher order moments do not help in identifying overcomplete models.\nAn example is provided in Figure 4 which helps to see how the matrices A\u2299A and A\u2297A behave differently in terms of mapping topics to word tuples.\nNote that for the n-persistent model, for n = 2, the 4th order moment reduces to\nM (2) 4 (x) = (A\u2299A)E\n[ hh\u22a4](A\u2299A)\u22a4. (14)\nContrasting the above equation with (12) and (13), we find that the 2-persistent model retains the desirable property of possessing Khatri-Rao products, while being more general than the form for single topic model in (12). This key property enables us to establish identifiability of topic models with finite persistence levels."}, {"heading": "4.2 Tensor algebra of the model", "text": "In Section 4.1, we provided a representation of the moment forms in the matrix form.

For the bag of words model, with n = 1, the core tensor is fully dense in general, while for the single topic model, with n \u2192 \u221e, the core tensor is diagonal which reduces to the CP decomposition. For a general topic model with persistence level n, the core tensor is in between these two extremes and has structured sparsity. This sparsity property of the core tensor is crucial towards establishing identifiability in the overcomplete regime.

See Figure 5. First, in the random analysis, the size and the degree conditions 4 and 5 are sufficient for satisfying the perfect n-gram matching and the krank conditions 2 and 3, shown by Theorems 3 and 4. Then, these conditions 2 and 3 ensure that the rank and the expansion conditions 6 and 7 hold, shown by Lemma 5. And finally, these conditions 6 and 7 together with non-degeneracy condition 1 conclude the primary identifiability result in Theorem 5. Note that the genericity of A is also required for these results to hold.\nPrimary deterministic analysis in Theorem 5: The deterministic analysis is primarily based on conditions on the n-gram matrix A\u2299n; but since these conditions are opaque (mainly expansion condition on A\u2299n, provided in condition 7), this analysis is related to conditions on matrix A itself. See Theorem 5 in Appendix A.1 for the identifiability result based on A\u2299n. We briefly discuss it below for the case when 2n number of words are available under the n-persistent topic model. From equation (8), the (2n)-th order moment of the observed variables under the n-persistent topic\nmodel can be written as\nM (n) 2n (x) =\n( A\u2299n ) E [ hh\u22a4 ]( A\u2299n )\u22a4 . (23)\nThe question is whether we can recover A, given the M (n) 2n (x). Obviously, the matrix A is not identifiable without any further conditions. First, non-degeneracy and rank conditions (conditions 1 and 6) are required. Assuming these two conditions, we have from (23) that\nCol ( M\n(n) 2n (x)\n) = Col ( A\u2299n ) .\nTherefore, the problem of recovering A from M (n) 2n (x) reduces to finding A\n\u2299n in Col ( A\u2299n ) .\nThen, we show that under the following expansion condition on A\u2299n and the genericity property, matrix A is identifiable from Col ( A\u2299n ) . The expansion condition (refer to condition 7 for a more detailed statement), imposes the following property on the bipartite graph G ( Vh, V (n) o ;A\u2299n ) 12,\n\u2223\u2223\u2223NA\u2299nRest.(S) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2265 |S|+ dmax ( A\u2299n ) , \u2200S \u2286 Vh, |S| > krank(A), (24)\nwhere dmax ( A\u2299n ) is the maximum node degree in set Vh, and the restricted version of n-gram matrix, denoted by A\u2299nRest., is obtained by removing its redundant (identical) rows (see Definition 9). The identifiability claim is proved by showing that the columns of A\u2299n are the sparsest and rank-1 vectors (in the tensor form) in Col ( A\u2299n ) under the expansion condition in (24) and genericity conditions. Note that since we only require expansion on sets larger than Kruskal rank, the expansion condition (24) is a more relaxed condition compared to expansion condition proposed in [7, 43] for identifiability in the undercomplete regime. For a more detailed comparison, refer to Remark 11 in Appendix A.1.\nDeterministic analysis in Theorem 1: Expansion and rank conditions in Theorem 5 are imposed on the n-gram matrix A\u2299n. According to the generalized matching notions, defined in Section 3.1, sufficient combinatorial conditions on matrix A (conditions 2 and 3) are introduced which ensure that the expansion and rank conditions on A\u2299n are satisfied. The following lemma is employed to establish these results, where we state an interesting property which relates the existence of a perfect matching in A\u2299n to the existence of a perfect n-gram matching in A. Lemma 3. If G(Y,X;A) has a perfect n-gram matching, then G(Y,X(n);A\u2299n) has a perfect matching. In the other direction, if G(Y,X(n);A\u2299n) has a perfect matching M\u2299n, then G(Y,X;A) has a perfect n-gram matching under the following condition on M\u2299n. All the matching edges (j, (i1, . . . , in)) \u2208 M\n\u2299n should satisfy i1 6= i2 6= \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 6= in for all j \u2208 Y . In words, the matching edges should be connected to nodes in X(n), which are indexed by tuples of distinct indices.\nSee Appendix A.4 for a proof. Using this lemma, condition 2 implies that G(Y,X(n);A\u2299n) has a perfect matching. Then, it is straightforward to argue that the expansion and rank conditions on A\u2299n are satisfied, which is shown in Lemma 5 in Appendix A.3.

Let G(Vh, V (n) o ;A\u2299n) denote the bipartite graph with vertex sets Vh corresponding to the hidden variables (indexing the columns of A \u2299n) and V (n) o corresponding to the n-th order observed variables (indexing the rows of A\u2299n) and edge matrix A\u2299n \u2208 R|V (n) o |\u00d7|Vh|. The bipartite graph G(Vh, V (n) o ;A\u2299n) satisfies the following expansion property on the restricted\nversion specified by A\u2299nRest.,\n\u2223\u2223\u2223NA\u2299nRest.(S) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2265 |S|+ dmax ( A\u2299n ) , \u2200S \u2286 Vh, |S| > krank(A), (25)\nwhere dmax\n( A\u2299n ) is the maximum node degree in set Vh.\nRemark 11. The expansion condition for the bag-of-words admixture model is provided in (4), introduced in [7]. The proposed expansion condition in (25) is inherited from (4), with two major modifications. First, the condition is appropriately generalized for our model which involves a graph with edges specified by the n-gram matrix, A\u2299n, as stated in (23). Second, the expansion property (4), proposed in [7], needs to be satisfied for all subsets S with size |S| \u2265 2, which is a stricter condition than the one proposed here in (25), since we can have krank(A) \u226b 2.\nThe deterministic identifiability result based on the conditions on A\u2299n, is stated in the following theorem for n \u2265 2, while n = 1 case is addressed in Remarks 4 and 11. The identifiability result relies on access to the (2n)-th order moment of observed variables xl, l \u2208 [2n], defined in equation (2) as\nM2n(x) := E [ (x1 \u2297 x2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 xn)(xn+1 \u2297 xn+2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 x2n) \u22a4 ] \u2208 Rp n\u00d7pn .\nTheorem 5 (Generic identifiability under deterministic conditions on A\u2299n). Let M (n) 2n (x) (defined in equation (2)) be the (2n)-th order moment of the n-persistent topic model described in Section 2. If the model satisfies conditions 1, 6 and 7, then, for any n \u2265 2, all the columns of population structure A are generically identifiable from M (n) 2n (x). Proof: Define B := A\u2299n \u2208 Rp n\u00d7q. Then, the moment characterized in equation (23) can be written as M (n) 2n (x) = BE [ hh\u22a4 ] B\u22a4. Since both matrices E [ hh\u22a4 ] and B have full column rank\n(from conditions 1 and 6), the rank of BE [ hh\u22a4 ] B\u22a4 is q where q = O(pn), and furthermore Col(BE [ hh\u22a4 ] B\u22a4) = Col(B). Let U := {u1, . . . , uq} \u2208 R pn be any basis of Col(BE [ hh\u22a4 ] B\u22a4) satisfying the following two properties:\n1) ui\u2019s have the smallest \u21130 norms.\n2) ui\u2019s have q smallest (tensor) ranks in the n-th order tensor form, i.e., Ui := ten(ui), i \u2208 [q], have q smallest ranks.\nLet the columns of matrix B be bi for i \u2208 [q]. Since all the bi\u2019s (which belong to Col(BE [ hh\u22a4 ] B\u22a4)) are rank-1 in the n-th order tensor form (since ten(bi) = a \u25e6n i ) and the number of non-zero entries in each of bi\u2019s is at most dmax(B) = dmax(A) n, we conclude that\nmax i Rank(ten(ui)) = 1 and max i \u2016ui\u20160 \u2264 dmax(B). (26)\nThe above bounds are concluded from the fact that bi \u2208 Col(BE [ hh\u22a4 ] B\u22a4), i \u2208 [q], and therefore the \u21130 norm and the rank properties of bi\u2019s are upper bounds for the corresponding properties of basis vectors ui\u2019s (according to the proposed conditions for ui\u2019s). Now, exploiting these observations and also the genericity of A and the expansion condition 7, we show that the basis vectors ui\u2019s are scaled columns of B. Since ui for i \u2208 [q], is a vector in the column space of B, it can be represented as ui = Bvi for some vector vi \u2208 R q. Equivalently, for\nany i \u2208 [q], ui = \u2211q j=1 vi(j)bj where bj = a \u2297n j is the j-th column of matrix B and vi(j) is a scalar which is the j-th entry of vector vi. Then, the tensor form of ui can be written as\nten(ui) =\nq\u2211\nj=1\nvi(j) ten(bj) =\nq\u2211\nj=1\nvi(j) ten(a \u2297n j ) =\nq\u2211\nj=1\nvi(j)a \u25e6n j = [[Diagn (vi);\nn times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 A, . . . , A]], (27)\nwhere the last equality is based on the notation defined in Definition 8. We define v\u0303i := [vi(j)]j:vi(j)6=0 as the vector which contains only the non-zero entries of vi, i.e., v\u0303i is the restriction of vector vi to its support. Therefore, v\u0303i \u2208 R\nr, where r := \u2016vi\u20160. Furthermore, the matrix A\u0303i := {aj : vi(j) 6= 0} \u2208 Rp\u00d7r is defined as the restriction of A to its columns corresponding to the support of vi. Let (a\u0303i)j denote the j-th column of A\u0303i. According to these definitions, equation (27) reduces to\nten(ui) = [[Diagn (v\u0303i); n times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 A\u0303i, . . . , A\u0303i]] = r\u2211\nj=1\nv\u0303i(j)[(a\u0303i)j ] \u25e6n, (28)\nwhich is derived by removing columns of A corresponding to the zero entries in vi. Next, we rule out that \u2016vi\u20160 \u2265 2 under two cases (2 \u2264 \u2016vi\u20160 \u2264 krank(A) and krank(A) < \u2016vi\u20160 \u2264 q), to conclude that ui\u2019s vectors are scaled columns of B.\nCase 1: 2 \u2264 \u2016vi\u20160 \u2264 krank(A). Here, the number of columns of A\u0303i \u2208 R p\u00d7\u2016vi\u20160 is less than or equal to krank(A) and therefore it is full column rank. Since, all the components of CP representation in equation (28) are full column rank 13, for any 14 n \u2265 2, we have Rank(ten(ui)) = r = \u2016vi\u20160 > 1, which contradicts the fact that maxiRank(ten(ui)) = 1 in (26).\nCase 2: krank(A) < \u2016vi\u20160 \u2264 q. Here, we first restrict the n-gram matrix B to distinct rows, denoted by BRest., as defined in Definition 9. Let u \u2032 i = BRest.vi. Since u \u2032 i is the restricted version of ui, we have\n\u2016ui\u20160 \u2265 \u2016u \u2032 i\u20160 = \u2016BRest.vi\u20160\n> \u2223\u2223NBRest.(Supp(vi)) \u2223\u2223\u2212 |Supp(vi)| \u2265 dmax(B),\nwhere the second inequality is from Lemma 4, and the third inequality follows from the graph expansion property (condition 7). This result contradicts the fact that maxi\u2016ui\u20160 \u2264 dmax(B) in (26).\nFrom above contradictions, \u2016vi\u20160 = 1 and hence, columns of B := A \u2299n are the scaled versions of ui\u2019s. \u2737\n13Note that for n \u2265 3, this full rank condition can be relaxed by Kruskal\u2019s condition for uniqueness of CP decomposition [15] and its generalization to higher order tensors [44]. Precisely, instead of saying Rank ( A\u0303i ) = krank ( A\u0303i ) = r, it is only required to have krank ( A\u0303i ) \u2265 (2r+n\u2212 1)/n to argue the result of case 1. This only improves the constants involved in the final result. 14Note that for n = 1, since the (tensor) rank of any vector is 1, this analysis does not work.\nThe following lemma is useful in the proof of Theorem 5. The result proposed in this lemma is similar to the parameter genericity condition in [7], but generalized for the n-gram matrix, A\u2299n. The lemma is proved on lines of the proof of Remark 2.2 in [7]. Lemma 4. If A \u2208 Rp\u00d7q is generic, then the n-gram matrix A\u2299n \u2208 Rp\nn\u00d7q satisfies the following property with Lebesgue measure one. For any vector v \u2208 Rq with \u2016v\u20160 \u2265 2, we have\n\u2225\u2225A\u2299nRest.v \u2225\u2225 0 > \u2223\u2223\u2223NA\u2299nRest.(Supp(v)) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2212 |Supp(v)|,\nwhere for a set S \u2286 [q], NA\u2299n(S) := {i \u2208 [p] n : A\u2299n(i, j) 6= 0 for some j \u2208 S}.\nHere, we prove the result for the case of n = 2. The proof can be easily generalized to larger n.\nLet A := M + Z be generic, where M is an arbitrary matrix, perturbed by random continuous perturbations Z. Consider the 2-gram matrix B := A\u2299A \u2208 Rp 2\u00d7q . It is shown that the restricted version of B, denoted by B\u0303 := BRest. \u2208 R p(p+1) 2 \u00d7q, satisfies the above genericity condition. We first establish some definitions. Definition 10. We call a vector fully dense if all of its entries are non-zero. Definition 11. We say a matrix has the Null Space Property (NSP) if its null space does not contain any fully dense vector. Claim 1. Fix any S \u2286 [q] with |S| \u2265 2, and set R := N\nM (2 -gram) Rest.\n(S). Let C\u0303 be a |S|\u00d7 |S| submatrix\nof B\u0303R,S. Then Pr(C\u0303 has the NSP) = 1.\nProof of Claim 1: First, note that B\u0303 can be expanded as\nB\u0303 := (A\u2299A)Rest. = (M \u2299M)Rest. + (M \u2299 Z + Z \u2299M)Rest. + (Z \u2299 Z)Rest.\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 :=U .\nLet s = |S| and let C\u0303 = [c\u03031|c\u03032| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |c\u0303s] \u22a4, where c\u0303\u22a4i is the i-th row of C\u0303. Also, let C := [c1|c2| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |cs] \u22a4 and W := [w1|w2| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |ws] \u22a4 be the corresponding |S| \u00d7 |S| submatrices of M (2 -gram) Rest. and U , respectively. For each i \u2208 [s], denote by Ni the null space of the matrix C\u0303i = [c\u03031|c\u03032| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |c\u0303i] \u22a4. Finally let N0 = R s. Then, N0 \u2287 N1 \u2287 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2287 Ns. We need to show that, with probability one, Ns does not contain any fully dense vector.\nIf one of Ni, i \u2208 [s], does not contain any full dense vector, the result is proved. Suppose that Ni contains some fully dense vector v. Since C is a submatrix of M (2 -gram) R,S , every row c \u22a4 i+1 of C contains at least one non-zero entry. Therefore,\nv\u22a4c\u0303i+1 = \u2211\nj\u2208[s]\nv(j)c\u0303i+1(j)\n= \u2211\nj\u2208[s]:ci+1(j)6=0\nv(j)(ci+1(j) + wi+1(j)),\nwhere {wi+1(j) : j \u2208 [s] s.t. ci+1(j) 6= 0} are independent random variables, and moreover, they are independent of c\u03031, . . . , c\u0303i and thus of v. By assumption on the distribution of the wi+1(j),\nPr [ v \u2208 Ni+1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223c\u03031, c\u03032, . . . , c\u0303i ] = Pr [ \u2211\nj\u2208[s]:ci+1(j)6=0\nv(j)(ci+1(j) + wi+1(j)) = 0 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223c\u03031, c\u03032, . . . , c\u0303i ] = 0. (29)\nConsequently,\nPr [ dim(Ni+1) < dim(Ni) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223c\u03031, c\u03032, . . . , c\u0303i ] = 1 (30)\nfor all i = 0, . . . , s\u2212 1. As a result, with probability one, dim(Ns) = 0. \u2737\nNow, we are ready to prove Lemma 4.\nProof of Lemma 4: It follows from Claim 1 that, with probability one, the following event holds: for every S \u2286 [q], |S| \u2265 2, and every |S| \u00d7 |S| submatrix C\u0303 of B\u0303R,S where R := NM (2 -gram)Rest. (S), then C\u0303 has the NSP.\nNow fix v \u2208 Rq with \u2016v\u20160 \u2265 2. Let S := Supp(v) and H := B\u0303R,S . Furthermore, let u \u2208 (R \\ {0}) |S| be the restriction of vector v to S; observe that u is fully dense. It is clear that \u2016B\u0303v\u20160 = \u2016Hu\u20160, so we need to show that\n\u2016Hu\u20160 > |R| \u2212 |S|. (31)\nFor the sake of contradiction, suppose that Hu has at most |R| \u2212 |S| non-zero entries. Since Hu \u2208 R|R|, there is a subset of |S| entries on which Hu is zero. This corresponds to a |S| \u00d7 |S| submatrix of H := B\u0303R,S which contains u in its null space. It means that this submatrix does not have the NSP, which is a contradiction. Therefore we conclude that Hu must have more than |R| \u2212 |S| non-zero entries, which finishes the proof. \u2737\nA.2 Proof of moment characterization lemmata\nRemark 12. In Lemmata 1 and 2, a specific case of order and persistence (m = rn) was considered. Here, we provide the moment form for a more general case. Assume that m = rn + s for some integers r \u2265 1, 1 \u2264 s \u2264 n2 , then\nM (n) 2m (x) =\n( r times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 A\u2299n \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297A\u2299n\u2297A(s -gram) )\nM\u03032r(h)\n( A((n\u2212s) -gram) \u2297 r\u22121 times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 A\u2299n \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297A\u2299n\u2297A(2s -gram) )\u22a4 ,\nwhere M\u03032r(h) \u2208 Rq r+1\u00d7qr+1 is the hidden moment as\nM\u03032r(h)((i1,...,ir+1),(j1,...,jr+1) ) :=\n{ E[hi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 hirh 2 ir+1 hj2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 hjr+1 ] if ir+1 = j1,\n0 o.w .\nThe tensor form is also characterized as\nT (n) 2m (x) = [[ S\u0303r; 2m times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 A,A, . . . , A ]] ,\nwhere S\u0303r \u2208 \u22972m R q is the core tensor in the above Tucker representation with the sparsity pattern as follows. Let i := (i1, i2, . . . , i2m). If\ni1 = i2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = in, in+1 = in+2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = i2n, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , i(2r\u22121)n+1 = i(2r\u22121)n+2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = i2rn,\ni2(m\u2212s)+1 = i2(m\u2212s)+2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = i2m,\nwe have S\u0303r ( i ) = M\u03032r(h)((in,i2n,...,irn,im),(i(r+1)n,i(r+2)n,...,i2rn,i2m) ). Otherwise, S\u0303r ( i ) = 0.\nProof of Lemma 1: In order to simplify the notation, similar to tensor powers for vectors, the tensor power for a matrix U \u2208 Rp\u00d7q is defined as\nU\u2297r := r times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 U \u2297 U \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 U \u2208 Rp r\u00d7qr . (32)\nFirst, consider the case m = rn for some integer r \u2265 1. One advantage of encoding yj, j \u2208 [2r], by basis vectors appears in characterizing the conditional moments. The first order conditional moment of words xl, l \u2208 [2m], in the n-persistent topic model can be written as\nE [ x(j\u22121)n+k|yj ] = Ayj, j \u2208 [2r], k \u2208 [n],\nwhere A = [a1|a2| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |aq] \u2208 R p\u00d7q. Next, the m-th order conditional moment of different views xl, l \u2208 [m], in the n-persistent topic model can be written as\nE[x1 \u2297 x2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 xm|y1 = ei1 , y2 = ei2 , . . . , yr = eir ] = a \u2297n i1 \u2297 a\u2297ni2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 a \u2297n ir ,\nwhich is derived from the conditional independence relationships among the observations xl, l \u2208 [m], given topics yj, j \u2208 [r]. Similar to the first order moments, since vectors yj, j \u2208 [r], are encoded by the basis vectors ei \u2208 R\nq, the above moment can be written as the following matrix multiplication\nE[x1 \u2297 x2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 xm|y1, y2, . . . , yr] = ( A\u2299n )\u2297r (y1 \u2297 y2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 yr) , (33)\nwhere the (\u00b7)\u2297r notation is defined in equation (32). Now for the (2m)-th order moment, we have\nM (n) 2m (x) := E [ (x1 \u2297 x2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 xm)(xm+1 \u2297 xm+2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 x2m) \u22a4 ]\n= E(y1,y2,...,y2r)\n[ E [ (x1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 xm)(xm+1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 x2m) \u22a4|y1, y2, . . . , y2r ]]\n(a) = E(y1,y2,...,y2r) [ E [ (x1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 xm)|y1, . . . , y2r ] E [ (xm+1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 x2m) \u22a4|y1, . . . , y2r ]]\n(b) = E(y1,y2,...,y2r) [ E [ (x1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 xm)|y1, . . . , yr ] E [ (xm+1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 x2m) \u22a4|yr+1, . . . , y2r ]]\n(c) = E(y1,y2,...,y2r)\n[([ A\u2299n ]\u2297r) (y1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 yr) (yr+1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 y2r) \u22a4 ([ A\u2299n ]\u2297r)\u22a4 ]\n= ([ A\u2299n ]\u2297r) E [ (y1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 yr) (yr+1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 y2r) \u22a4 ]([ A\u2299n ]\u2297r)\u22a4\n(d) = ([ A\u2299n ]\u2297r) M2r(y) ([ A\u2299n ]\u2297r)\u22a4 , (34)\nwhere (a) results from the independence of (x1, . . . , xm) and (xm+1, . . . , x2m) given (y1, y2, . . . , y2r) and (b) is concluded from the independence of (x1, . . . , xm) and (yr+1, . . . , y2r) given (y1, . . . , yr) and the independence of (xm+1, . . . , x2m) and (y1, . . . , yr) given (yr+1, . . . , y2r). Equation (33) is used in (c) and finally, the (2r)-th order moment of (y1, . . . , y2r) is defined as M2r(y) :=\nE [ (y1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 yr) (yr+1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 y2r) \u22a4 ] in (d).\nFor M2r(y), we have by the law of total expectation\nM2r(y) := E [ (y1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 yr) (yr+1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 y2r) \u22a4]\n= Eh [ E [ (y1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 yr) (yr+1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 y2r) \u22a4 |h ]]\n= Eh\n[( r times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 h\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 h )( r times\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 h\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 h )\u22a4]\n= M2r(h),\nwhere the third equality is concluded from the conditional independence of variables yj, j \u2208 [2r], given h and the model assumption that E [ yj|h ] = h, j \u2208 [2r]. Substituting this in equation (34), finishes the proof for the n-persistent topic model.

Lemma 5. Assume that the bipartite graph G(Vh, Vo;A) has a perfect n-gram matching (condition 2 is satisfied). Then, the following results hold for the n-gram matrix A\u2299n:\n1) If A is generic, A\u2299n is full column rank (condition 6) with Lebesgue measure one (almost surely).\n2) If krank condition 3 holds, A\u2299n satisfies the proposed expansion property in condition 7.\nProof: Let M denote the perfect n-gram matching of the bipartite graph G(Vh, Vo;A). From Lemma 3, there exists a perfect matching M\u2299n for the bipartite graph G(Vh, V (n) o ;A\u2299n). Denote the corresponding bi-adjacency matrix to the edge set M as AM . Similarly, BM denotes the corresponding bi-adjacency matrix to the edge set M\u2299n. Note that Supp(AM ) \u2286 Supp(A) and Supp(BM ) \u2286 Supp(A \u2299n).\nSince BM is a perfect matching, it consists of q := |Vh| rows, each of which has only one non-zero entry, and furthermore, the non-zero entries are in q different columns. Therefore, these rows form q linearly independent vectors. Since the row rank and column rank of a matrix are equal, and the number of columns of BM is q, the column rank of BM is q or in other words, BM is full column rank. Since A is generic, from Lemma 6 (with a slight modification in the analysis 15), A\u2299n is also full column rank with Lebesgue measure one (almost surely). This completes the proof of part 1.\nNext, the second part is proved. From krank definition, we have\n|NA(S \u2032)| \u2265 |S\u2032| for S\u2032 \u2286 Vh, |S \u2032| \u2264 krank(A),\n15Lemma 6 result is about the column rank of A itself, but here it is about the column rank of A\u2299n for which the same analysis works. Note that the support of BM (which is full column rank here) is within the support of A \u2299n and therefore Lemma 6 can still be applied.\nwhich is concluded from the fact that the corresponding submatrix of A specified by S\u2032 should be full column rank. From this inequality, we have\n|NA(S \u2032)| \u2265 krank(A) for S\u2032 \u2286 Vh, |S \u2032| = krank(A). (35)\nThen, we have\n|NA(S)| \u2265 |NA(S \u2032)| for S\u2032 \u2282 S \u2286 Vh, |S| > krank(A), |S \u2032| = krank(A),\n\u2265 krank(A) \u2265 dmax(A) n, (36)\nwhere (35) is used in the second inequality and the last inequality is from krank condition 3.\nIn the restricted n-gram matrix A\u2299nRest., the number of neighbors for a set S \u2286 Vh, |S| > krank(A), can be bounded as\n\u2223\u2223\u2223NA\u2299nRest.(S) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2265 |NA(S)| + |S|\n\u2265 dmax(A) n + |S| for |S| > krank(A),\nwhere the first inequality is due to the fact that the set NA\u2299nRest. consists of rows indexed by the following two subsets: n-tuples (i, i, . . . , i) where all the indices are equal and n-tuples (i1, . . . , in) with distinct indices, i.e., i1 6= i2 . . . 6= in. The former subset is exactly NA(S) while the size of the latter subset is at least |S| due to the existence of a perfect n-gram matching in A. The bound (36) is used in the second inequality. Since dmax ( A\u2299n ) = dmax(A)\nn, the proof of part 2 is also completed.\n\u2737\nRemark 13. The second result of above lemma is similar to the necessity argument of (Hall\u2019s) Theorem 6 for the existence of perfect matching in a bipartite graph, but generalized to the case of perfect n-gram matching and with additional krank condition.\nA.4 (Auxiliary) lemma\nProof of Lemma 3: We show that ifG(Y,X;A) has a perfect n-gram matching, thenG(Y,X(n);A\u2299n) has a perfect matching. The reverse can be also immediately shown by reversing the discussion and exploiting the additional condition stated in the lemma. Let E\u2299n denote the edge set of the bipartite graph G(Y,X(n);A\u2299n). Assume G(Y,X;A) has a perfect n-gram matching M \u2286 E. For any j \u2208 Y , let NM (j) denote the set of neighbors of vertex j according to edge set M . Since M is a perfect n-gram matching, |NM (j)| = n for all j \u2208 Y . It can be immediately concluded from Definition 3 that sets NM (j) are all distinct, i.e., NM (j1) 6= NM (j2) for any j1, j2 \u2208 Y, j1 6= j2. For any j \u2208 Y , let N \u2032 M (j) denote an arbitrary ordered n-tuple generated from the elements of set NM (j). From the definition of n-gram matrix, we have A \u2299n(N \u2032M (j), j) 6= 0 for all j \u2208 Y . Hence, (j,N \u2032M (j)) \u2208 E \u2299n for all j \u2208 Y which together with the fact that all N \u2032M (j)\u2019s tuples are distinct, it results that M\u2299n := {(j,N \u2032M (j))|j \u2208 Y } \u2286 E \u2299n is a perfect matching for G(Y,X(n);A\u2299n). \u2737\nLemma 6. Consider matrix C \u2208 Rm\u00d7r which is generic. Let C\u0303 \u2208 Rm\u00d7r be such that Supp(C\u0303) \u2286 Supp(C) and the non-zero entries of C\u0303 are the same as the corresponding non-zero entries of C. If C\u0303 is full column rank, then C is also full column rank, almost surely.\nProof: Since C\u0303 is full column rank, there exists a r \u00d7 r submatrix of C\u0303, denoted by C\u0303S, with non-zero determinant, i.e., det(C\u0303S) 6= 0. Let CS denote the corresponding submatrix of C indexed by the same rows and columns as C\u0303S . The determinant of CS is a polynomial in the entries of CS . Since C\u0303S can be derived from CS by keeping the corresponding non-zero entries, det(CS) can be decomposed into two terms as\ndet(CS) = det(C\u0303S) + f(CS),\nwhere the first term corresponds to the monomials for which all the variables (entries of CS) are also in C\u0303S and the second term corresponds to the monomials for which at least one variable is not in C\u0303S . The first term is non-zero as stated earlier. Since C is generic, the polynomial f(CS) is non-trivial and therefore its roots have Lebesgue measure zero. It implies that det(CS) 6= 0 with Lebesgue measure one (almost surely), and hence, it is full (column) rank. Thus, C is also full column rank, almost surely. \u2737\nFinally, Theorem 1 is proved by combining the results of Theorem 5 and Lemma 5.\nProof of Theorem 1: Since conditions 2 and 3 hold and A is generic, Lemma 5 can be applied which results that rank condition 6 is satisfied almost surely and expansion condition 7 also holds. Therefore, all the required conditions for Theorem 5 are satisfied almost surely and this completes the proof. \u2737"}, {"heading": "B Proof of Random Identifiability Result (Theorem 2)", "text": "We provide detailed proof of the steps stated in the proof sketch of random result in Section 5.2.\nB.1 Proof of existence of perfect n-gram matching and Kruskal results\nProof of Theorem 3: Vertex sets X and Y are partitioned, described as follows (see Figure 6). Define J := c pn . Partition set X uniformly at random into n sets of (almost) equal size\n16, denoted by X \u2032l , l \u2208 [n]. Define sets Xl := \u222a l i=1X \u2032 i, l \u2208 [n]. Furthermore, partition set Y uniformly at random,\nhierarchically as follows. First, partition into J sets, each with size at most ( c pn )n\u22121 , and denote them by Yi, i \u2208 [J ]. Next, partition each of these new smaller sets Yi further into J sets, each with size at most ( c pn )n\u22122 . Do it iteratively up to n \u2212 1 steps, where at the end, set Y is partitioned into sets with size at most c pn . The first two steps are shown in Figure 6.\nProof by induction: The existence of perfect n-gram matching from set Y to set X is proved by an induction argument. Consider one of intermediate sets in the hierarchical partitioning of\n16By almost, we mean the maximum difference in the size of partitions is 1 which is always possible.\nY with size O(pl) and its further partitioning into J := c pn sets, each with size O(p l\u22121), for any l \u2208 {2, . . . , n}. In the induction step, it is shown that if there exists a perfect (l\u22121)-gram matching from each of these subsets of Y with size O(pl\u22121) to Xl\u22121, then there exists a perfect l-gram matching from the original set with size O(pl) to set Xl. Specifically, in the last induction step, it is shown that if there exists a perfect (n\u2212 1)-gram matching from each set Yl, l \u2208 [J ], to set Xn\u22121, then there exists a perfect n-gram matching from Y to Xn = X.\nBase case: The base case of induction argument holds as follows. By applying Lemma 8 and Lemma 7, there exists a perfect matching from each partition in Y with size at most c pn = O(p) to set X1, whp.\nInduction step: Consider J different bipartite graphs Gi(Yi,Xn\u22121;Ei), i \u2208 [J ], by considering sets Yi andXn\u22121 and the corresponding subset of edges Ei \u2282 E incident to them. See Figure 7a. The induction step is to show that if each of the corresponding J bipartite graphs Gi(Yi,Xn\u22121;Ei), i \u2208 [J ], has a perfect (n\u2212 1)-gram matching, then whp, the original bipartite graph G(Y,X;E) has a perfect n-gram matching.\nLet us denote the corresponding perfect (n \u2212 1)-gram matching of Gi(Yi,Xn\u22121;Ei) by Mi. Furthermore, the set of all subsets of Xn\u22121 with cardinality n \u2212 1 are denoted by Pn\u22121(Xn\u22121), i.e., Pn\u22121(Xn\u22121) includes the sets with (n \u2212 1) elements in the power set\n17 of Xn\u22121. For each set S \u2208 Pn\u22121(Xn\u22121), take the set of all nodes in Y which are connected to all members of S according to the union of matchings \u222aJi=1Mi. Call this set as the parents of S, denoted by Pa(S). According to the definition of perfect (n \u2212 1)-gram matching, there is at most one node in each set Yi which is connected to all members of S through the matching Mi and therefore, |Pa(S)| \u2264 J = c p n . In\n17The power set of any set S is the set of all subsets of S.\naddition, note that sets Pa(S) impose a partitioning on set Y , i.e., each node j \u2208 Y is exactly included in one set Pa(S) for some S \u2208 Pn\u22121(Xn\u22121). This is because of the perfect (n \u2212 1)-gram matchings considered for sets Yi, i \u2208 [J ]. Now, a perfect n-gram matching for the original bipartite graph is constructed as follows. For any S \u2208 Pn\u22121(Xn\u22121), consider the set of parents Pa(S). Create the bipartite graph GS(Pa(S),X \u2032 n;ES), where ES \u2282 E is the subset of edges incident to partitions Pa(S) \u2282 Y and X \u2032 n \u2282 X. Denote by dS the minimum degree of nodes in set Pa(S) in the bipartite graph GS(Pa(S),X \u2032 n;ES). Applying Lemma 8, we have\nPr[dS \u2265 1 + \u03b2 log(p/n)] \u2265 1\u2212 J exp\n( \u2212 2\nn2 (dmin \u2212 \u03b2n log(p/n))\n2\ndmin\n) (37)\n\u2265 1\u2212 c\nn p\u2212\u03b2 log 1/c = 1\u2212O(p\u2212\u03b2 log 1/c),\nwhere \u03b2 log 1/c > n\u2212 1, and the last inequality is concluded from the degree bound dmin \u2265 \u03b1 log p. Furthermore, we have |Pa(S)| \u2264 c pn = c|X \u2032 n|. Now, we can apply Lemma 7 concluding that there exists a perfect matching from Pa(S) to X \u2032n within the bipartite graph GS(Pa(S),X \u2032 n;ES), with probability at least 1\u2212O(p\u2212\u03b2 log 1/c). Refer to Figure 7b for a schematic picture. The edges of this perfect matching are combined with the corresponding edges of the existing perfect (n \u2212 1)-gram matchings Mi, i \u2208 [J ], to provide n incident edges to each node i \u2208 Pa(S). It is easy to see that this provides a perfect n-gram matching from Pa(S) to X. We perform the same steps for all sets S \u2208 Pn\u22121(Xn\u22121) to obtain a perfect n-gram matching from any Pa(S), S \u2208 Pn\u22121(Xn\u22121), to X. Finally, according to this construction, the union of all of these matchings is a perfect n-gram matching from \u222aS\u2208Pn\u22121(Xn\u22121) Pa(S) = Y to X. This finishes the proof of induction step. Note that here we analyzed the last induction step where the existence of perfect n-gram matching is concluded from the existence of corresponding perfect (n\u2212 1)-gram matchings. The earlier induction steps, where the existence of perfect l-gram matching is concluded from the existence of corresponding perfect (l \u2212 1)-gram matchings for any l \u2208 {2, . . . , n}, can be\nsimilarly proven.\nProbability rate: We now provide the probability rate of the above events. Let N (hp) l , l \u2208 [n], denote the total number of times that perfect matching result of Lemma 7 is used in step l in order to ensure that there exists a perfect l-gram matching from corresponding partitions of Y to set Xl, whp. Let N (hp) = \u2211\nl\u2208[n]N (hp) l . As earlier, let Pl\u22121 ( Xl\u22121 ) denote the set of all subsets of Xl\u22121\nwith cardinality l \u2212 1. We have\n\u2223\u2223Pl\u22121 ( Xl\u22121 )\u2223\u2223 = (\u2223\u2223Xl\u22121 \u2223\u2223 l \u2212 1 ) = ( l\u22121 n p l \u2212 1 ) , l \u2208 {2, . . . , n}.\nAccording to the construction method of l-gram matching from (l \u2212 1)-gram matchings, proposed in the induction step, \u2223\u2223Pl\u22121 ( Xl\u22121 )\u2223\u2223 is the number of times Lemma 7 is used in order to ensure that there exists a perfect l-gram matching for each partition on the Y side. Since at most Jn\u2212l number of such l-gram matchings are proposed in step l, the number N (hp) l can be bounded as\nN (hp) l \u2264 J n\u2212l \u2223\u2223Pl\u22121 ( Xl\u22121 )\u2223\u2223 = Jn\u2212l ( l\u22121 n p\nl \u2212 1\n) , l \u2208 {2, . . . , n}. (38)\nSince in the first step, N (hp) 1 = J n\u22121 number of perfect matchings needs to exist in the above discussion, we have\nN (hp) = Jn\u22121 + n\u2211\nl=2\nN (hp) l\n\u2264 Jn\u22121 + n\u2211\nl=2\nJn\u2212l ( l\u22121 n p\nl \u2212 1\n)\n\u2264 ( c p\nn\n)n\u22121 + n\u2211\nl=2\n( c p\nn\n)n\u2212l( e p\nn\n)l\u22121\n\u2264 n ( e p\nn\n)n\u22121 = O(pn\u22121),\nwhere inequality (38) is used in the first inequality and J := c pn and inequality (n k ) \u2264 ( enk )k are exploited in the second inequality. Since the result of Lemma 7 holds with probability at least 1\u2212O(p\u2212\u03b2 log 1/c) and it is assumed that \u03b2 log 1/c > n\u22121, by applying union bound, we have the existence of perfect n-gram matching with probability at least 1\u2212O(p\u2212\u03b2\n\u2032 ), for \u03b2\u2032 = \u03b2 log 1c \u2212 (n\u2212 1) > 0.\nFurthermore, note that the degree concentration bound in (37) is also used O(pn\u22121) times. Since the bound in (37) holds with probability at least 1\u2212O(p\u2212\u03b2 log 1/c) and it is assumed that \u03b2 log 1/c > n\u22121, this also reduces to the same probability rate. The coefficient of the above polynomial probability rate is also explicitly computed, saying that the perfect n-gram matching exists with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b31p \u2212\u03b2\u2032 , with\n\u03b31 = e n\u22121 ( c nn\u22121 + e2 1\u2212 \u03b41 n\u03b2 \u2032+1 ) ,\nwhere \u03b41 is a constant satisfying e 2 ( p n )\u2212\u03b2 log 1/c < \u03b41 < 1. \u2737\nProof of Theorem 4: Let G(Y,X;A) denote the corresponding bipartite graph to matrix A where node sets Y = [q] and X = [p] index the columns and rows of A respectively.

This concludes that the random bipartite graph has a perfect n-gram matching whp, under these size and degree conditions.\n\u2737\nB.2 (Auxiliary) lemmata\nLemma 7 (Existence of perfect matching for random bipartite graphs). Consider a random bipartite graph G(W,Z;E) with |W | = w nodes on the left side and |Z| = z on the right side, and each node i \u2208 W is randomly connected to di different nodes in set Z. Let dw := mini\u2208W di. Assume\nthat it satisfies the size condition w \u2264 cz for some constant 0 < c < 1 and the degree condition dw \u2265 1 + \u03b2 log z for some constant \u03b2 > 0. Then, there exists a perfect matching in the random bipartite graph G(W,Z;E) with probability at least 1\u2212O(z\u2212\u03b2 log 1/c) where \u03b2 log 1c > 0.\nProof: From Hall\u2019s theorem (Theorem 6), the existence of perfect matching for a bipartite graph is equivalent to occurrence of the following event\nE\u0303 := \u201c\u2200S \u2286 W : |N(S)| \u2265 |S|\u201d.\nSimilar to the analysis in the proof of Theorem 4, it is concluded from union bound\nPr ( E\u0303c ) = Pr(\u2203S \u2286 W s. t. |N(S)| < |S|) \u2264 w\u2211\ns=1\n( w\ns\n)( z\ns\n)( s\nz\n)dws\n\u2264 w\u2211\ns=1\n( e w\ns\n)s( e z\ns )s(s z )dws\n\u2264 w\u2211\ns=1\n( e2wdw\u22121\nzdw\u22121\n)s\n\u2264 w\u2211\ns=1\n( e2cdw\u22121 )s ,\nwhere the bound (n k ) \u2264 ( enk )k is used in the second inequality.

Consider a random bipartite graph G(Y,X;E) with |Y | = q and |X| = p, where each node i \u2208 Y is randomly connected to di different nodes in set X. Let Y \u2032 \u2282 Y be any subset 18 of nodes in Y with size |Y \u2032| = q\u2032 and X \u2032 \u2282 X be a random (uniformly chosen) subset of nodes in X with size |X \u2032| = p\u2032. Create the new bipartite graph G(Y \u2032,X \u2032;E\u2032) where edge set E\u2032 \u2282 E is the subset of edges in E incident to Y \u2032 and X \u2032. Denote the degree of each node i \u2208 Y \u2032 within this new bipartite graph by d\u2032i. Let dmin := mini\u2208Y di and d \u2032 min := mini\u2208Y \u2032 d \u2032 i. Then, if dmin > r p p\u2032 for a non-negative integer r, we have\nPr[d\u2032min \u2265 r + 1] \u2265 1\u2212 q \u2032 exp\n( \u22122(p\u2032/p)2 (dmin \u2212 (p/p \u2032)r)2\ndmin\n) .\nProof: For any i \u2208 Y \u2032, we have\nPr[d\u2032i \u2264 r] = r\u2211\nj=0\n( p\u2032\nj\n)( p\u2212 p\u2032\ndi \u2212 j )/( p di ) ,\n18Note that Y \u2032 need not to be uniformly chosen and the result is valid for any subset of nodes Y \u2032 \u2282 Y .\nwhere the inner term of summation is a hypergeometric distribution with parameters p (population size), p\u2032 (number of success states in the population), di (number of draws) and j is the hypergeometric random variable denoting number of successes. The following tail bound for the hypergeometric distribution is provided [45,46]\nPr[d\u2032i \u2264 r] \u2264 exp(\u22122t 2 i di),\nfor ti > 0 given by r = (p\u2032 p \u2212 ti ) di. Note that assumption dmin > p p\u2032 r in the lemma is equivalent to having ti > 0, i \u2208 Y . Considering the minimum degree, for any i \u2208 Y \u2032, we have\nPr[d\u2032i \u2264 r] \u2264 exp(\u22122t 2dmin),\nfor t > 0 given by r = (p\u2032 p \u2212t ) dmin. Substituting t from this equation gives the following bound\nPr[d\u2032i \u2264 r] \u2264 exp\n( \u22122(p\u2032/p)2 (dmin \u2212 (p/p \u2032)r)2\ndmin\n) . (40)\nFinally, applying the union bound, we can prove the result as follows\nPr[d\u2032min \u2265 r + 1] =Pr[\u2229 q\u2032 i=1{d \u2032 i \u2265 r + 1}]\n\u22651\u2212\nq\u2032\u2211\ni=1\nPr[d\u2032i \u2264 r]\n\u22651\u2212\nq\u2032\u2211\ni=1\nexp ( \u22122(p\u2032/p)2 (dmin \u2212 (p/p \u2032)r)2\ndmin\n)\n=1\u2212 q\u2032 exp ( \u22122(p\u2032/p)2 (dmin \u2212 (p/p \u2032)r)2\ndmin\n) ,\nwhere the union bound is applied in the first inequality and the second inequality is concluded from (40). \u2737\nA lower bound on the Kruskal rank of matrix A based on a sufficient relaxed expansion property on A is provided in the following lemma. Lemma 9. If A is generic and the bipartite graph G(Y,X;A) satisfies the relaxed 19 expansion property |N(S)| \u2265 |S| for any subset S \u2286 Y with |S| \u2264 r, then krank(A) \u2265 r, almost surely.\nBefore proposing the proof, we state the marriage or Hall\u2019s theorem which gives an equivalent condition for having a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. Theorem 6 (Hall\u2019s theorem, [47]). A bipartite graph G(Y,X;E) has Y -saturating matching if and only if for every subset S \u2286 Y , the size of the neighbors of S is at least as large as S, i.e., |N(S)| \u2265 |S|.\nProof of Lemma 9: Denote the submatrix AN(S),S by A\u0303S , i.e., A\u0303S := AN(S),S . Exploiting marriage or Hall\u2019s theorem, it is concluded that the bipartite graph G(S,N(S); A\u0303S ) has a perfect matching MS for any subset S \u2286 Y such that |S| \u2264 r. Denote by A\u0303MS the corresponding matrix to this perfect matching edge set MS , i.e., A\u0303MS keeps the non-zero entries of A\u0303S on edge set MS and\n19There is no dmax term in contrast to the expansion property proposed in condition 7.\neverywhere else, it is zero. Note that the support of A\u0303MS is within the support of A\u0303S . According to the definition of perfect matching, the matrix A\u0303MS is full column rank. From Lemma 6, it is concluded that A\u0303S is also full column rank almost surely. This is true for any A\u0303S with S \u2286 Y and |S| \u2264 r, which directly results that krank(A) \u2265 r, almost surely. \u2737\nFinally, Theorem 2 is proved by exploiting the random results on the existence of perfect n-gram matching and Kruskal rank, provided in Theorems 3 and 4.\nProof of Theorem 2: We claim that if random conditions 4 and 5 are satisfied, then deterministic conditions 2 and 3 hold whp. Then Theorem 1 can be applied and the proof is done. From size and degree conditions, Theorem 3 can be applied, which implies that the perfect n-gram matching condition 2 is satisfied with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b31p\n\u2212\u03b2\u2032 for \u03b2\u2032 = \u03b2 log 1c \u2212 (n\u2212 1) > 0. The conditions required for Theorem 4 also hold and by applying this theorem we have the bound krank(A) \u2265 cp, with probability at least1\u2212\u03b32p\n\u2212\u03b2\u2032 . Combining this inequality with the upper bound on degree d in condition 5, we conclude that krank condition 3 is also satisfied whp. Hence, all the conditions required for Theorem 1 are satisfied with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b3p\u2212\u03b2 \u2032 , where\n\u03b3 = \u03b31 + \u03b32 = e n\u22121 ( c nn\u22121 + e2 1\u2212 \u03b41 n\u03b2 \u2032+1 ) + cn\u22121e2 nn(1\u2212 \u03b42) ,\nand this completes the proof. \u2737"}, {"heading": "C Relationship to CP Decomposition Uniqueness Results", "text": "In this section, we provide a more detailed comparison with some uniqueness results of overcomplete CP decomposition. Here, the following CP decomposition for the third order tensor T \u2208 Rp\u00d7s\u00d7q is considered,\nT =\nr\u2211\ni=1\nai \u25e6 bi \u25e6 ci, (41)\nwhere A = [a1| . . . |ar] \u2208 R p\u00d7r, B = [b1| . . . |br] \u2208 R s\u00d7r and C = [c1| . . . |cr] \u2208 R q\u00d7r. The most important and general uniqueness result of CP, called Kruskal\u2019s condition, is provided in [15], where it is guaranteed that the above CP decomposition is unique if\nkrank(A) + krank(B) + krank(C) \u2265 2r + 2.\nSince then, several works have analyzed the uniqueness of CP decomposition. One set of works assume that one of the components, say C, is full column rank [17, 18]. it is shown in [18], for generic (fully dense) components A,B and C, if r \u2264 q and r(r \u2212 1) \u2264 p(p\u2212 1)s(s \u2212 1)/2, then the CP decomposition in (41) is generically unique. Now, we demonstrate how this CP uniqueness result can be adapted to our setting. First, consider the matrix M \u2208 Rps\u00d7q which is obtained by stacking the entries of T as\nM(i\u22121)s+j,k = Tijk.\nThen, we have\nM = (A\u2299B)C\u22a4. (42)\nOn the other hand, for the 2-persistent topic model with 4 words (n = 2,m = 2), the moment can be written as\nM (2) 4 (x) = (A\u2299A)E\n[ hh\u22a4 ] (A\u2299A)\u22a4,\nfor A \u2208 Rp\u00d7q. The following matrix has the same column span of M (2) 4 (x),\nM \u2032 = (A\u2299A)C \u2032\u22a4,\nfor some full rank matrix C \u2032 \u2208 Rq\u00d7q. Our random identifiability result in Theorem 2 provides the uniqueness of A and C \u2032, given M \u2032, under the size condition q \u2264 ( cp2 )2 and the additional degree condition 5. Note that as discussed in the previous section, this identifiability argument is the same as the unique decomposition of the corresponding tensor. Thus, in equation (42), by setting A = B and a full rank square matrix C, we obtain the 2-persistent topic model, under consideration in this paper. Thus, the identifiability results of [18] are applicable to our setting, if we assume generic (i.e. fully dense) matrix A. However, we incorporate a sparse matrix A, and therefore, require different techniques to provide identifiability results. We note that the size bound specified in [18] is comparable to the size bound derived in this paper (for random structured matrices), but we have additional degree considerations for identifiability. Analyzing the regime where the uniqueness conditions of [18] are satisfied under sparsity constraints is an interesting question for future investigation."}], "references": [{"title": "Unsupervised feature learning and deep learning: A review and new perspectives", "author": ["Yoshua Bengio", "Aaron Courville", "Pascal Vincent"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.5538,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Learning overcomplete representations", "author": ["Michael S.

This set of higher-order expansion conditions allow for overcomplete models, and require the existence of a perfect matching from latent topics to higher order observed words.
