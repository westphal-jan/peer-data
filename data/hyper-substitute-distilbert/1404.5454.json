Such notices are typically difficult to understand and ignored by more than 40 percent of users (Technet 2012). In other cases, a plethora of requests for information such as user location may be shown in system dialogs at run-time or installation time. Beyond the normal channels for sharing data, potential breaches of information are possible via attacks by malicious third parties and malware, and through surprising situations such as the AOL data release (Arrington 2006; Adar 2007) and de-anonymization of released Netflix logs (Narayanan and Shmatikov 2008). The charges by the Federal Trade Commission against Facebook (FTC 2011) and Google (FTC 2012) highlight increasing concerns by privacy advocates and government institutions about the largescale recording of personal data.\nIdeal approaches to privacy in online services would enable users to benefit from machine learning over data from populations of users, yet consider users\u2019 preferences as a top priority. Prior research in this realm has focused on designing privacy-preserving methodologies that can provide for control of a privacy-utility tradeoff (Adar 2007; Krause and Horvitz 2008). Research has also explored the feasibility of incorporating user preferences over what type of data can be logged (Xu et al. 2007; Cooper 2008; Olson, Grudin, and Horvitz 2005; Krause and Horvitz 2008).\nWe introduce a new approach to privacy that we refer to as stochastic privacy. Stochastic privacy centers on the simple idea of providing a guarantee to users about the maximum likelihood that their data will be accessed and used by a service provider. We refer to this measure as the assessed or communicated privacy risk, which may be increased in return for increases in the quality of service or other incentives. Very small probabilities of sharing data may be tolerated by individuals (just as lightning strikes are tolerated as a rare event), yet offer providers sufficient information to optimize over a large population of users. Stochastic privacy depends critically on harnessing inference and decision making to make choices about data collection within the constraints of a guaranteed privacy risk.\nWe explore procedures that can be employed by service providers when preferences about the sharing of data are represented as privacy risk. The goal is to maximize the\nar X\niv :1\n40 4.\n54 54\nv1 [\ncs .A\nI] 2\n2 A\npr 2\n01 4\nutility of service using data extracted from a population of users, while abiding by the agreement reached with users on privacy risk. We show that optimal selection of users under these constraints is NP-hard and thus intractable, given the massive size of the online systems. As a solution, we propose two procedures, RANDGREEDY and SPGREEDY, that combine greedy value of information analysis with obfuscation to offer mechanisms for tractable optimization, while satisfying stochastic privacy guarantees. We present performance bounds for the expected utility achievable by these procedures compared to the optimal solution. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Introduction of stochastic privacy, an approach that rep-\nresents preferences about the probability that data will be shared, and methods for trading off privacy risk, incentives, and quality of service.\n\u2022 A tractable end-to-end system for implementing a version of stochastic privacy in online services.\n\u2022 RANDGREEDY and SPGREEDY procedures for sampling users under the constraints of stochastic privacy, with theoretical guarantees on the acquired utility.\n\u2022 Evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedures on a case study of user selection for personalization in web search."}, {"heading": "Stochastic Privacy Overview", "text": "Figure 1 provides an overview of stochastic privacy in the context of a particular design of a system that implements the methodology. The design is composed of three main components: (i) a user preference component, (ii) a system preference component, and (iii) an optimization component for guiding the system\u2019s data collection. We now provide details about each of the components and then formally specify the optimization problem for selective sampling module."}, {"heading": "User Preference Component", "text": "The user preference component interacts with users (e.g., during signup) and establishes an agreement between a user and service provider on a tolerated probability that the user\u2019s data will be shared in return for better quality of service or incentives. Representing and capturing users\u2019 tolerated privacy risk allows users to move beyond the binary choice of yes or no on the sharing of data. The incentives offered to users can be personalized based on the metalevel information available for a user (e.g., general location infor-\nmation inferred from a previously shared IP address) and can vary from guarantees of improved service (Krause and Horvitz 2010) to complementary software and entries in a lottery to win cash prizes (as done by the comScore service (Wikipedia-comScore 2006)).\nFormally, let W be the population of users signed-up for a service. Each user w \u2208 W is represented with the tuple {rw, cw, ow}, where ow is the metadata information (e.g., IP address) available for user w prior to selecting and logging finer-grained data about the user. rw is the privacy risk assessed by the user, and cw is the corresponding incentive provided in return for the user assuming the risk. The elements of this tuple can be updated through interactions between the system and the user. For simplicity of analysis, we shall assume that the poolW and user preferences are static."}, {"heading": "System Preference Component", "text": "The goal of the service provider is to optimize the quality of service. For example, a provider may wish to personalize web search and to improve the targeting of advertising for maximization of revenue. The service provider may record the activities of a subset of users (e.g., sets of queries issued, sites browsed, etc.) and use this data to provide better service globally or to a specific cohort of users. We model the private data of activity logs of user w by variable lw \u2208 2L, where L represents the web-scale space of activities (e.g., set of queries issued, sites browsed, etc.) . However, lw is observed by the system only after w is selected and the data from w is logged. We model the system\u2019s uncertain belief of lw by a random variable Yw, with lw being its realization distributed according to conditional probability distribution P (Yw = lw|ow). In order to make an informed decision about user selection, the distribution P (Yw = lw|ow) is learned by the system using data available from the user and recorded logs of other users. We quantify the utility of application by logging activities LS from selected users S through function g : 2L \u2192 R, given by g( \u22c3 s\u2208S ls). The expected value of the utility that the system can expect to gain by selecting users S with observed attributes OS is characterized by distribution P and utility function g as: g\u0303(S) \u2261 EYS [ g( \u22c3 s\u2208S ls) ] = \u2211 LS\u22082L\u00d7S ( P (YS =\nLS |OS) \u00b7 g( \u22c3 s\u2208S ls) ) . However, the application itself may be using the logs LS in a complex manner (such as training a ranker (Bennett et al. 2011)) and evaluating this on complex user metrics (Hassan and White 2013). Hence, the system\nuses a surrogate utility function f(S) \u2248 g\u0303(S) to capture the utility through a simple metric, for example, coverage of query-clicks obtained from the sampled users (Singla and White 2010) or reduction in uncertainty of click phenomena (Krause and Horvitz 2008).\nIn our model, we require that the set function f to be nonnegative, monotone (i.e., whenever A \u2286 A\u2032 \u2286 W , it holds that f(A) \u2264 f(A\u2032)) and submodular. Submodularity is an intuitive notion of diminishing returns, stating that, for any sets A \u2286 A\u2032 \u2286 W , and any given user a /\u2208 A\u2032, it holds that f(A \u222a {a}) \u2212 f(A) \u2265 f(A\u2032 \u222a {a}) \u2212 f(A\u2032). These conditions are general, satisfied by many realistic, as well as complex utility functions (Krause and Guestrin 2007), such as reduction in click entropy (Krause and Horvitz 2008). As a concrete example, consider the setting where attributes O represent geo-coordinates of the users and D : O \u00d7O \u2192 R computes the geographical distance between any two users. The goal of the service provider is to provide locationbased personalization of web search. For such an application, click information from local users provides valuable signals for personalizing search (Bennett et al. 2011). The system\u2019s goal is to select a set of users S, and to leverage data from these users to enhance the service for the population. For search queries originating from any other user w, it uses the click data from the nearest user in S, given by arg mins\u2208S D(os, ow). One approach for finding such a set S is solving the k-medoid problem which aims to minimize the sum of pairwise distances between selected set and the remaining population (Mirzasoleiman et al. 2013; Kaufman and Rousseeuw 2009). Concretely, this can be captured by the following submodular utility function:\nf(S) = 1 |W | \u2211 w\u2208W ( min x\u2208X D(ox, ow)\u2212 min s\u2208S\u222aX D(os, ow) ) (1)\nHere, X is any one (or a set of) fixed reference location(s), for example, simply representing origin coordinates and is used ensure that function f is non-negative and monotone. Lemma 1 formally states the properties of this function."}, {"heading": "Optimization Component", "text": "To make informed decisions about data access, the system computes the expected value of information (VOI) of logging the activities of a particular user, i.e., the marginal utility that the application can expect by logging the activity of this user (Krause and Horvitz 2008). In the absence of sufficient information about user attributes, the VOI may be small, and hence needs to be learned from the data. The system can randomly sample a small set of users from the population that can be used to learn and improve the models of VOI computation (explorative sampling in Figure 1). For example, for optimizing the service for a user cohort speaking a specific language, the system may choose to collect logs from a subset of users to learn how languages spoken by users map to geography. If preferences about privacy risk were not being regarded, VOI can be used to select which users to log with a goal of maximizing the utility for the service provider (selective sampling in Figure 1). Given that the utility function of the system is submodular, a greedy\nselection rule makes near-optimal decisions about data access (Krause and Guestrin 2007). However, this simple approach could violate the privacy guarantees made with users. To act in accordance with the assessed privacy risk, we design selective sampling procedures that couple obfuscation with VOI analysis to select the set of users to provide data.\nThe system needs to ensure that both the explorative and selective sampling approaches respect the privacy guarantees made to users: the likelihood of sampling any user w throughout the execution of the system must be less than the privacy risk factor rw. The system tracks the sampling risk (likelihood of sampling) that user w faces during phases of the execution of explorative sampling, denoted rESw , and selective sampling, denoted rSSw . The privacy guarantee for a user is preserved as long as: rw\u2212 ( 1\u2212(1\u2212rESw )\u00b7(1\u2212rSSw ) ) \u2265 0. This difference between the assessed risk and risk faced by a user can be viewed as the sampling budget of that user."}, {"heading": "Optimization Problem for Selective Sampling", "text": "We now focus primarily on the selective sampling module and formally introduce the optimization problem.

Note that we interchangeably write utility acquired by procedure as f(M) to denote f(SM ) where SM is the set of users selected by running M . We shall now consider a simpler setting of constant privacy risk rate r for all users and unit cost per user (thus reducing the budget constraint to a simpler cardinal constraint, given by |S| \u2264 B).

It stops when |S| = B.\nA fundamental result by Nemhauser, Wolsey, and Fisher (1978) states that the utility obtained by this greedy selection strategy is guaranteed to be at least (1\u2212 1/e) (= 0.63) times that obtained by OPT. This result is tight under reasonable complexity assumptions (P 6= NP ) (Feige 1998).

By keeping the batch size \u03c8(s) \u2264 W \u00b7 r/B, the procedure ensures that the privacy guarantees are satisfied. As our user poolW is static, to reduce complexity, we consider a simpler version of RANDGREEDY that defers the greedy selection. Formally, this is equivalent to first sampling the users from W at rate r to create a subset W\u0303 such that |W\u0303 | = |W | \u00b7 r, and then, running the GREEDY algorithm on W\u0303 to greedily select a set of users of size B.\nThe initial random sampling ensures a guarantee on the privacy risk for users during the execution of the procedure.

As in GREEDY, it operates in iterations and selects the element s\u2217 with maximum marginal utility at each iteration. However, to ensure stochastic privacy, it obfuscates s\u2217 with similar users using distance metric D to create a set \u03c8(s\u2217) of size 1/r, then samples one user randomly from \u03c8(s\u2217) and removes the entire set \u03c8(s\u2217) for further consideration.\nThe guarantees on privacy risk hold by the following arguments: During the execution of the algorithm, any user w becomes a possible candidate of being selected if the user is part of \u03c8(s\u2217) in some iteration (e.g., iteration i). Given that |\u03c8(s\u2217)| \u2265 1/r and algorithm randomly sample v \u2208 \u03c8(s\u2217), the likelihood of w being selected in iteration i is at most r.

For any given w \u2208 W , let us define its \u03b1-neighborhood to be the set of users within a distance \u03b1 from w (i.e., \u03b1-close to w): N\u03b1(w) = {v : D(v, w) \u2264 \u03b1}.

We considered a fraction of users who issued at least one query in month of October 2013, restricted to queries coming from IP addresses located within ten neighboring states in the western region of the United States. This resulted in a pool W of seven million users. We considered a setting where system has access to metadata information of geo-coordinates of the users, as well as a probe of the last 20 search-result clicks for each user, which together constitutes the observed attributes of user denoted as ow. Each of these clicks are then classified into a topical hierarchy from a popular web directory, the Open Directory Project (ODP) (dmoz.org), using automated techniques (Bennett, Svore, and Dumais 2010). With a similar objective to White, Dumais, and Teevan (2009), the system then uses this classification to identify users who are expert in the business domain. We used a simple rule of classifying a user as an expert if at least one click was issued in the domain of interest. With this, the system marks a set of users W \u2032 \u2286 W as experts, and the set S in Equation 1 is restricted to W \u2032. We note that the specific thresholds or variable choices do not affect the overall results below."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "We now discuss the findings from our experiments.\nVarying the budget B: In our first set of experiments, we vary the budget B, or equivalently the number of users selected, and measured the utility acquired by different procedures. The privacy risk rate is set fixed to r = 1/10000. Figure 2(a) illustrates that both RANDGREEDY and SPGREEDY are competitive w.r.t GREEDY and clearly outperform naive baseline of RANDOM.\nVarying the privacy risk r: We then vary the level of privacy risk, for a fixed budget B = 50, to measure the robustness of the RANDGREEDY and SPGREEDY. The results in Figure 2(b) demonstrate that the performance of RANDGREEDY and SPGREEDY degrades smoothly, as per the performance analysis in Theorems 2,3.\nAnalyzing performance of SPGREEDY: Lastly, we perform experiments to understand the execution of SPGREEDY and the loss incurred from the obfuscation step. SPGREEDY removes 1/r users from pool at every iteration. As a result, for small privacy risk r, the relative loss from obfuscation (i.e., relative % difference in marginal utility acquired by a user chosen by greedy selection, compared to one finally picked after obfuscation) could possibly increase over the execution of procedure as illustrated in Figure 2(a), using a moving average of window size 10. However, the diminishing returns property of the utility ensures that SPGREEDY incurs very low absolute loss in marginal utility from obfuscation at every step."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We introduced stochastic privacy, a new approach to privacy that centers on service providers abiding by guarantees about not exceeding a specified likelihood of logging data, and maximizing information collection in accordance with these guarantees. We presented procedures and an overall system design for maximizing the quality of services while respecting privacy risks agreed with populations of users.\nDirections for this research include the assessments of user preferences about the probability of sharing data, including how users trade increases in privacy risk for enhanced service and monetary incentives. Directions also include exploring the rich space of designs for interactive and longer-term controls and settings of a tolerated risk of sharing data. Opportunities include policies and analyses based on the sharing of data as a privacy risk rate over time. As an example, systems might one day consider decisions about logging one or more search sessions of users where privacy risk is assessed in terms of the risk of sharing search sessions over time. In another research direction, designs can include models where users are notified when they are selected to share data and are provided with a special reward and option of declining to share at that time. Iterative analyses can be developed where subsets of users are actively engaged with the option to assume higher levels of privacy risk or to simply provide additional information in return for special incentives. Inferences about the likely preferences on privacy risk and about incentives for subpopulations could be folded into the selection procedures."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2014, "abstractText": "Online services such as web search and e-commerce applications typically rely on the collection of data about users, including details of their activities on the web. Such personal data is used to enhance the quality of service via personalization of content and to maximize revenues via better targeting of advertisements and deeper engagement of users on sites. To date, service providers have largely followed the approach of either requiring or requesting consent for opting-in to share their data. Users may be willing to share private information in return for better quality of service or for incentives, or in return for assurances about the nature and extend of the logging of data. We introduce stochastic privacy, a new approach to privacy centering on a simple concept: A guarantee is provided to users about the upperbound on the probability that their personal data will be used. Such a probability, which we refer to as privacy risk, can be assessed by users as a preference or communicated as a policy by a service provider. Service providers can work to personalize and to optimize revenues in accordance with preferences about privacy risk. We present procedures, proofs, and an overall system for maximizing the quality of services, while respecting bounds on allowable or communicated privacy risk. We demonstrate the methodology with a case study and evaluation of the procedures applied to web search personalization. We show how we can achieve nearoptimal utility of accessing information with provable guarantees on the probability of sharing data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
