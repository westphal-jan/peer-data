Also, such knowledge representations modeled by the knowledge engineer are not generally automatically reusable outside the specific context for which the knowledge representation was originally developed. Such a problem can be easily seen in legal domain, wherein, the cost associated with not reducing such gaps is substantially high.\nThis paper contributes with an approach using a Structured English knowledge representation language with which this gap can be substantially minimized. The paper also introduces a tool, called KR4IPLaw, which is intended as a proof-ofconcept implementation for the proposed approach. To illustrate it, in this paper, we concentrate on one branch of law dealing with technical innovations, namely patent law, esp. only a subset of laws used by an examiner for evaluating a patent application.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the existing state of the art. Section 3 describes how the existing Structured English approach could be adapted and applied in the context of the legal domain. In section 4, we introduce the proof-ofconcept tool KR4IPLaw. By a concrete use case example we show how procedural patent rules can be semi-formally represented using Structured English."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The OMG\u2019s Model Driven Architecture, \u2018MDA\u2019 [1] provides a basis for representing information on different layers of knowledge representation models ( CIM, PIM and PSM).\nSemantic Business Vocabulary and Business Rules, \u2018SBVR\u2019 [2], is an ISO terminological dictionary (vocabulary) for defining business concepts and rules. SBVR works on the Computational Independent Model layer of the OMG\u2019s MDA. It supports the use of Structured English (SE), a computational-independent English (natural) language having the syntax of a structured programming for representing business vocabularies and business rules. SBVR captures the structural and behavioral aspects of business processes, as well as the policies that should guide the agents\u2019 behavior in certain situations. A core idea of business rules formally supported by SBVR is the following: Rules build on facts, and facts build on concepts as expressed by terms. Terms express business concepts; facts make assertions about these concepts; rules constrain and support these facts [2]. Fig 1 depicts the relation of SBVR and OMG\u2019s MDA.\nFig.1. SBVR position in MDA (adapted from [2]).\nThe power of SBVR is disclosed by the fact that the SBVR specification itself was formally written in SBVR Structured English, \u2018SSE\u2019[1]. The use of SBVR in legal domain was proposed by Johnsen and Berre in [3, 4]. In [5] we showed how OMG\u2019s MDA could be viewed in the domain of patent law, wherein, we provided the first ideas on using SBVR \u2013SE in patent law domain."}, {"heading": "3 Semi-formal KR in legal domain", "text": "We adapt the approach of the OMG Semantic Business Vocabulary and Business Rules [2] (OMG SBVR) standard to the patent law domain. Fig 2 shows the overview of such an adoption.\nSBVR defines the vocabulary and rules for describing the legal semantics using SSE. Even though SSE does not provide all the expressivity required for translating the procedural rules into a formal reasoning, the simple approach of SSE helps the end users (i.e. the domain experts and legal practitioners) to define their legal vocabularies & rules in a more understandable manner, which at the same time can be also interpretable by the computer.\nLike in SBVR, we define the legal (procedural/substantive) rules in a structured natural language (a Structured English syntax) using predefined legal vocabularies, consisting of legal concepts (concepts which have a meaning in the legal tradition, e.g. claim construction vocabulary) in template-based legal rules.\n\u201cLegal vocabulary\u201d and \u201clegal (argumentation) rules\u201d are made of:\n Noun concepts, which correspond to legal concepts  Verb concepts, which correspond to relationships between legal concepts  Definitional rules, which constrain these relationships so that they can be\nused to define consistent and complete arguments\nLegal concepts represented by noun concepts must be explicitly defined with the intended semantics given in an authoritative source or otherwise acknowledge by implicit pragmatic understanding (the ordinary natural language meaning of the term used). Verb concepts can only use such recognized noun concepts as their terms.\nThe legal rules can then be constructed using the \u201cif \u2026 then \u2026\u201d, \u201cat least\u201d, \u201ceach\u201d as well as definitional alethic and behavioral deontic legal norm modalities (\u201cobliged\u201d, \u201cpermitted\u201d \u2026), etc. The following example in the next section illustrates its use."}, {"heading": "4 KR4IPLaw", "text": "KR4IPLaw (Knowledge Representation for Intellectual Property Law) is a tool implemented on the Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) platform. It currently supports SBVR 1.0 metamodel and is built based on SBeaVeR [6], SWeDE and OntoSphere3D [7]. The long term goal of this tool is to act as an interface, which can be easily handled by legal practitioners and is capable enough to provide all the necessary inputs for an knowledge engineer to model legal rules for (semi-/) automated reasoning after transforming them into a Platform Independent Model (PIM) rules. Such a tool will\naccommodate all the possible KR\u2019s (from formal to natural language) and act as a bridge between the legal practitioner and knowledge modeler.\nTo illustrate the use of SSE in the legal domain, we consider the legal (procedural) rules followed by an examiner in evaluating the essential subject matter requirement as defined in Paragraph \u00b6 7.33.01 of United States Patent Law [8]- which states as follow:\nUsing SBVR Structured English\nLegal Concepts (Noun concepts defined in green and individual noun concepts are defined in dark- green starting with Capital letters)\nclaim\nDefinition Define the invention and are what aspects are legally enforceable\nDictionary basis patentlaw Source based on USPTOGlossary General_concept patent\nBuilding on the same lines, we obtain other legal concepts like:\nexaminer, office_action, paragraphs, statement, argument, date, drawing, applicant, effective_feature, invention essential_subject_matter_requirement, Paragarph_7_33_01\nLegal Facts (verb concepts are defined in blue)\noffice_action includes paragraphs claim is_rejected_under essential_subject_matter_requirement office_action include statement applicant conceals effective_feature effective_feature is_about the invention examiner applies Paragarph_7_33_01 examiner rejects the claim\n\u00b6 7.33.01 Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112, 1st Paragraph, Essential Subject Matter Missing From Claims (Enablement)\nClaim [1] rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, as based on a disclosure which is not enabling. [2] critical or essential to the practice of the invention, but not included in the claim(s) is not enabled by the disclosure. 1. This rejection must be preceded by form paragraph 7.30.01 or 7.103.\n2. In bracket 2, recite the subject matter omitted from the claims.\nFig 3 gives an overview of the KR4IPLaw tool from a legal practitioner\u2019s perspective, wherein, legal practitioner/domain experts either define case based legal vocabularies or use a pre-agreed legal vocabulary stored in a central public/privatelyshared repositories (such as OntoMaven [9, 10], GitHub) and build legal rules based on it as shown before.\nFor storing thus generated rules in a machine oriented format and for interchanging such rules in a platform independent way, we translate them into XML using the language family of RuleML [11] as expression language on the PIM level. In particular, we make use of two complementary OASIS standards - OASIS Legal Document Markup Language, \u2018LegalDocML\u2019[12] and OASIS Legal Rule Markup Language \u2018LegalRuleML\u2019,[13, 14] \u2013 for the XML-based legal-knowledge modeling and representation of legal norms and arguments. The SBVR vocabulary and facts are mapped on to an OWL2 ontology [15, 16] for generating the required knowledge base\nLegal (procedural) rules (for \u00b6 7.33.01):\n1. It is obligatory that examiner rejects the claim and office_action includes paragraphs Paragarph_7_33_01 if claim is_rejected_under essential_subject_matter_requirement\n2. It is obligatory that office_action include statement and argument and date and drawing if claim is_rejected_under Paragarph_7_33_01\n3. It is necessary that examiner applies Paragarph_7_33_01 if applicant conceals effective_feature and effective_feature is_about the invention\nneeded to provide the backend reasoning support for rule reasoner (e.g. prova [17]) embedded within a legal expert system. KR4IPLaw also provides an interface which allows legal practitioner/domain experts, who have little technical skills in the field of Semantic Web, to graphically inspect, modify and review ontology components and a second interface which provides knowledge modelers with tools for editing (with helpful features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and error-detection), validation, dependency-check, etc\u2026 for thus generated ontologies. Fig 4a and Fig 4b depicts these two interfaces."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "This paper presented how SBVR\u2019s Structured English (SSE) approach can be adapted to the legal domain. The proposed approach can act as a bridge between legal practitioner/domain experts and technical knowledge modelers. With an example from patent law we showed how SSE can help legal practitioners to build semi-formal procedural rules using legal vocabularies. As a proof-of-concept we introduced the tool, called KR4IPLaw.
