This research paper focuses on pre-processing of Punjabi text documents. Pre-processing is structured representation of the input text. Pre-processing of ontology graph generation includes allowing input restrictions to the text, removal of special symbols and punctuation marks, removal of duplicate terms, removal of stop words, extract terms by matching input terms with dictionary and gazetteer lists terms.\nKeywords- Ontology, Pre-processing phase, Ontology Graph, Knowledge Representation, Natural Language Processing.\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\u201cOntology\u201d has originated from Philosophy branch but in the last decades, Ontology in information systems has become common in numerous other fields like Natural Language Processing, Database integration, Internet technologies, Artificial Intelligence, Multiagent Systems etc.\nInformally Ontology describes the terms, concepts, classes and relationship between them. Formally Ontology is defined as: \u201cformal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization\u201d. Conceptualization [4] is an abstract view of the world that represents the knowledge for any motive. Explicit implies that the variety of concepts used and therefore the constraints on their utilization are explicitly outlined. Formal make reference to the reality that ontology ought to be machine understandable and readable. Shared reveals the insight that an ontology captures accordant knowledge i.e. it\u2019s not individual personal information, however accepted by a group.\nThe ontology graph is a new methodology that is employed to represent the ontology of knowledge in a domain. The ontology graph comprises of diverse levels of conceptual components, in which they are related together by various types of relations. It is essentially a dictionary framework (i.e. terms) that unite one another to represent a class, to formulate various concepts and identify meanings. The conceptual layout of an ontology graph comprises of numerous terms with a few relationships between them, so that the different conceptual components are framed like a lattice.\nAn ontology graph modeling process includes two phases: Pre-processing phase and Processing phase. The aim of this paper is to represent the pre-processing phase of domain ontology graph generation system for Punjabi text documents.\nPunjabi language is a part of Indo-Aryan language. Punjabi language is the formal language of the Punjab, one of the states of India. Punjabi is spoken in Punjab, Punjab Province of Pakistan, and Jammu-Kashmir. It\u2019s conjointly use for communication as a minority language in several other countries where Punjabi people are living, such as the United States of America, Australia, Canada, and England. Punjabi is written in the two different scripts; Gurumukhi script in India and Shahmukhi script in Pakistan.\nThe Punjabi text document corpus contains 1000 documents with an average of 700 Punjabi words in each document. The text documents belong to five different domains, which are Agriculture, Entertainment, Health, Politics, and Sports. Each domain contains 200 Punjabi documents. These five domains are labeled as classes for the domain ontology learning process. The documents of the corpus in every class are further divided to permit 70% of them for the learning set and 30% for the testing set.\nII. PRE-PROCESSING PHASE\nText Preprocessing is an extremely important part of any Natural Language Processing system, since the characters, terms recognized at this stage are the basic units goes to further processing stages. Pre-processing phase represents the input text in organized manner. In pre-processing phase, manipulation and filtration of terms is carried out to omit/ eliminate terms that do not consist of context like stop words, special symbols, punctuation marks etc. When Pre-processing has been done, only those terms are remaining that are meaningful to the Natural Language Processing System. Preprocessing phase includes: Allowing input restrictions to input text, elimination of useless symbols, removal of duplicate terms, Removal of Stop words, Extract terms matched with dictionary terms, and Extract terms matched with Gazetteer list.\nTerm Extraction is a pre-processing phase that identified all meaningful Punjabi terms in input text documents. An existing electronic dictionary is utilized. It contains 40,000 Punjabi words. It is very helpful for identifying the meaningful terms inside the input text. To extract the terms, besides the existing dictionary terms, an additional input of Punjabi terms are also required. These additional terms are Middle names, last names, Politicians names, Sports personality names, Sports names, Movies names, Location names etc. To extract the meaningful terms and remove the meaningless terms, Stop Word list is required. We created\nISSN: 2231-5381 http://www.ijettjournal.org Page 142\nStop list manually by analyzing Punjabi documents. The Stop Word List contains 1,500 words.\nVarious sub phases of Term Extraction are as follows:"}, {"heading": "A. Allowing Input Restrictions to the input text", "text": "The proposed system allows only Unicode based text as input i.e. it allows only Gurumukhi text as input. In Punjab, the standard for writing the Punjabi language is Gurumukhi script. The range of the Unicode text is given. System checks first character, if it is lies between the Unicode character ranges then it accepts the input, otherwise it rejects the input and again checks next character and so on."}, {"heading": "B. Removal of Useless Symbols", "text": "This phase of Pre-processing includes elimination of useless\nsymbols that are meaningless. Types of useless symbols are:\na. Special Symbols and Punctuation marks (<,>, :,{,},[,],^,&,*,(,) etc.) b. Extra tabs c. Extra spaces d. Shift e. New line\nSystem checks the input character one by one, if character is a special symbol or punctuation mark, skips the character and checks the next character. It only adds the Unicode character in the file. To remove extra white spaces and tabs, system checks the character with the previous character, if previous character matched with current character then it does not add this character in file and set this character as previous character and again check for next character i.e. if previous\ncharacter and current character both are commas then only one comma is added to the file. If all terms in a file is in new line, then replace the new line with comma (,). After removal of symbols, output file contains only comma separated terms."}, {"heading": "C. Removal of Duplicate Terms", "text": "System omit the duplicate terms from the input Punjabi text documents. Duplicate terms are omitted from input by comparing the terms. If duplicate term found then set this term as null otherwise it is added to the terms list. Removal of duplicate terms from input hinders duplicate terms from come into sight in final output. It is essential to omit duplicate terms from input text because it minimized the number of input terms and takes less time for further processing."}, {"heading": "D. Remove Stop Words", "text": "High-frequency terms occurring in input text are well known as stop words. E.g. \u0a39\u0a4b\u0a23 (h\u014d\u1e47), \u0a26 \u0a47 (d\u0113), \u0a28 \u0a42\u0a70 (n\u016b\u1e43), \u0a28\u0a3e\u0a32 (n\u0101l), \u0a09\u0a71\u0a25\u0a47 (utth\u0113), \u0a24 \u0a47(t\u0113) etc. These terms have to be discarding from input text because these terms do not have relevant information to the Punjabi ontology generation.\nWe have created Punjabi language Stop word list manually from Punjabi input data set. We manually analyzed the data set and identified 1,500 stop words.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nThe Punjabi text document corpus contains 1000 documents with an average of 700 Punjabi words in each document. The text documents belong to five different domains, which are Agriculture, Entertainment, Health, Politics, and Sports. Each domain contains 200 Punjabi documents. These five domains are labeled as classes for the domain ontology learning process. The documents of the corpus in every class are further divided to permit 70% of them for the learning set and 30% for the testing set. These documents are stored in text files.\nFiles and arrays are used as data structure for preprocessing of Punjabi text documents.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have discussed the Pre-processing phase of Ontology graph generation system in Punjabi. The Preprocessing includes use of lexical resources such as Punjabi stop word list and gazetteer list. These lexical resources are developed manually by analyzing the Punjabi corpus as there are no Punjabi resources available on the web. These lexical resources can be helpful for developing new NLP systems in Punjabi language."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "I am grateful to Er.
