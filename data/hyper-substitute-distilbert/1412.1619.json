However, in practice, very often we have additional information at hand that can be beneficial to the learning process. One such example is the use of unlabeled data drawn from the marginal distributions, that gives rise to the semi-supervised learning setting [Chapelle et al., 2006]. Another example is when the training data is coming from a related problem, as in multi-task learning [Caruana, 1998], domain adaptation [Ben-David et al., 2010, Mansour et al., 2009], and transfer learning [Pan and Yang, 2010, Taylor and Stone, 2009]. Among others, there is the use of structural information, such as taxonomy, or different views on the same data [Blum and Mitchell, 1998], or even a sort of privileged information [Vapnik and Vashist, 2009]. In the recent years all these directions have received a considerable empirical and theoretical attention. In this work we focus on a less theoretically studied direction in the use of supplementary information \u2013 learning with auxiliary hypotheses, that is classifiers or regressors originating from another tasks. More in details, the learner is supplied with a collection of hypotheses in addition to the training set. The goal of the learner is to figure out which ones are helpful and combine them to improve the performance\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n16 19\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n4 D\non the target problem. We will call these auxiliary hypotheses the source hypotheses and we will say that helpful ones accelerate the learning on the target task.\nIndeed, the scenario described above is a case of transfer learning, or learning effectively from possibly small amount of data by reusing the prior knowledge. A first formalization and theoretical treatment of transfer learning under the use of source hypothesis was given by Kuzborskij and Orabona [2013b] in the Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL) framework, albeit empirically it has already been extensively exploited in the past [Yang et al., 2007, Orabona et al., 2009, Tommasi et al., 2010, Luo et al., 2011, Kuzborskij et al., 2013]. The attractive quality of an HTL framework is the fact that we assume very little about source hypotheses, that is, we do not need any knowledge about the tasks they come from, or any information about the model or the way they were trained. In other words, we treat each hypothesis as a \u201cblack box\u201d. This offers an advantage compared to transfer learning and domain adaptation frameworks where one requires access to the data of the source domain. For example, in domain adaptation [Ben-David et al., 2010], one employs large unlabeled samples to estimate the relatedness of source and target domains to perform adaptation. Even if unlabeled data are abundant, the estimation of adaptation parameters can be computationally prohibitive. A hypothetical example is a large number of domains involved, or, for instance, when one acquires new domains incrementally. There, keeping unlabeled data from all the domains and re-estimating the parameters is a necessity. In HTL we naturally alleviate these practical limitations through indirect access to the source domain by means of a source hypothesis.\nAs was mentioned above, the first theoretical analysis of HTL was carried out by Kuzborskij and Orabona [2013b], where we analyzed HTL problem cast as a regularized least-squares with a single fixed, unweighted, source hypothesis. There, we came up with polynomial generalization bound that depends on the performance of that fixed source hypothesis on the target task. In this work we considerably extend and generalize the theory of HTL. Our contributions. We formulate a general Hypothesis Transfer Learning problem through regularized Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) with respect to any non-negative smooth loss function and any strongly convex regularizer. For its solution we prove high-probability generalization bounds that exhibit fast rate, i.e. O(1/m), of convergence whenever any weighted combination of multiple source hypotheses performs well on the target task. In other words, we show theoretically that HTL facilitates a faster generalization. In addition, we show that, if the combination is perfect, the error on the training set becomes the error we observe on the whole target distribution. Furthermore, we analyze an excess risk of our formulation, and conclude that a good source hypothesis also speeds up the convergence to the performance of the bestin-the-class. As a byproduct of our study, we prove an upper bound on the Rademacher complexity of a smooth loss class that provides extra information compared to that of Lipschitz loss classes. This is an alternative to the analysis of Srebro et al. [2010a] that holds under much weaker assumptions, and it might be of independent interest.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we make a brief review of the previous work. Next, we formally state the HTL in Section 4 and present main results right after in Section 5. In Section 5.1 we discuss the implications and compare them to the body of literature in transfer learning and learning with the fast rates. Next, in Section 6, we present the proofs of our main results. Section 7 concludes the paper."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The framework of Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL) that we address in this paper was first formally introduced and studied theoretically by Kuzborskij and Orabona [2013b]. It was shown that the generalization ability of the regularized least-squares HTL algorithm improves if supplied source hypothesis performs well on the target task. More specifically, we proposed a key criterion, the risk of the source on the target domain, that captures the relatedness of the source and target domains. Later, Ben-David and Urner [2013] showed a similar bound, but with different source performance criterion. Instead of considering general source hypothesis, they have confined their analysis to the linear hypothesis class. This allowed them to\nshow that the target hypothesis generalizes better when it is close to the good source hypothesis. From this perspective it is easy to interpret the source hypothesis as an initialization point in the hypothesis class. Naturally, given a starting position that is close to the best in the class, one generalizes well.\nPrior to these works there were few studies trying to understand the learning with auxiliary hypotheses subject to different conditions. Li and Bilmes [2007] have analyzed a Bayesian approach to HTL. Employing a PAC-Bayes analysis they showed that given a prior on the hypothesis class, the generalization ability of logistic regression improves if the prior is informative on the target task. Mansour et al. [2008] analyzed a setting of multiple source hypotheses combination. There, in addition to the source hypotheses, the learner receives unlabeled samples drawn from the source distributions, that are used to weight and combine these source hypotheses. They have studied the possibility of learning in such a scenario, however, did not address generalization properties of any particular algorithm.\nUnlike these works, we focus on the generalization ability of a large family of HTL algorithms, that generates the target predictor given a set of multiple source hypotheses. In particular, we analyze HTL through Regularized Empirical Risk Minimization with the choice of any non-negative smooth loss and any strongly convex regularizer. Thus our analysis covers a wide range of algorithms, including many empirically successful ones. One category of those, prevalent in computer vision [Kienzle and Chellapilla, 2006, Yang et al., 2007, Tommasi et al., 2010, Aytar and Zisserman, 2011, Kuzborskij et al., 2013, Tommasi et al., 2014], employs the principle of biased regularization [Scho\u0308lkopf et al., 2001]. For example, instead of penalizing large weights by introducing norm \u2016w\u20162 into the objective function, one enforces them to be close to some \u201cprior\u201d model, that is \u2016w\u2212wprior\u20162. This principle also found its applications in other fields, such as NLP [Daume\u0301 III, 2007, Daume\u0301 III et al., 2010], and electromyography classification [Orabona et al., 2009, Tommasi et al., 2013]. Many empirical works have also investigated the use of the source hypotheses in a \u201cblack box\u201d sense rather than biased regularization, sometimes not even posing the problem as a transfer learning [Duan et al., 2009, Li et al., 2010, Luo et al., 2011, Bergamo and Torresani, 2014], and recently in conjunction with deep neural networks [Hoffman et al., 2013, Oquab et al., 2014].\nIn the literature there are several other machine learning directions conceptually similar to the one we consider in this work. Arguably, the most well known one is the Domain Adaptation (DA) problem. The standard machine learning assumption is that the training and the testing sets are sampled from the same probability distribution. In such case, we expect that a hypothesis generated by the learner from that training set will lead to sensible predictions on the testing set. The difficulty arises when training and testing distributions differ, that is we have a training set sampled from the source domain and testing set from the target domain. Clearly, the hypothesis generated from the source domain can perform arbitrarily badly on the target one. A paradigm of DA, addressing this issue has received a lot of attention in recent years [Ben-David et al., 2010, Mansour et al., 2009]. Although, this framework is different from the one we study in this work, we identify similarities and compare our findings with the theory of learning from different domains in Section 5.2."}, {"heading": "3 Definitions", "text": "In this section we introduce the definitions used in the rest of the paper.\nWe denote random variables by capital letters. The expected value of a random variable distributed according to a probability distributionD is denoted by EX\u223cD[X] and the variance is denoted by VarX\u223cD[X]. The small and capital bold letters will stand respectively for the vectors and matrices, e.g. x = [x1, . . . , xd]> and A \u2208 Rd1\u00d7d2 . Denoting by X and Y respectively the input and output space of the learning problem, the training set is S = {(xi, yi)}mi=1, drawn i.i.d. from the probability distribution D defined over X \u00d7Y . Without the loss of generality we will have X = {x : \u2016x\u2016 \u2264 1} and we will focus on the problems where Y = [\u2212C,C].\nTo measure the accuracy of a learning algorithm, we introduce a non-negative loss function `(h(x), y), which measures the cost incurred predicting h(x) instead of y. The risk of a hypothesis h, with respect to\na probability distribution D, and the empirical risk measured on the sample S are then defined as\nR(h) := E (x,y)\u223cD\n[`(h(x), y)], and R\u0302S(h) := 1\nm m\u2211 i=1 `(h(xi), yi).\nIn the following, the risk is measured with respect to the probability distribution of the target domain, unless stated otherwise. We capture the smoothness of the loss function via following definition.\nH-smooth loss function. We say a non-negative loss function ` : Y \u00d7 Y 7\u2192 R+ is H-smooth iff,\n\u2200t, r \u2208 R,\u2200y \u2208 Y, |\u2207t`(t, y)\u2212\u2207r`(r, y)| \u2264 H|t\u2212 r|.\nIn this work we will make use of strongly convex regularizers, functions that are defined as follows.\nStrongly convex function. A function \u2126 is \u03c3-strongly convex w.r.t. a norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 iff for all w,v, and \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) we have\n\u2126(\u03b1w + (1\u2212 \u03b1)v) \u2264 \u03b1\u2126(w) + (1\u2212 \u03b1)\u2126(v)\u2212 \u03c3 2 \u03b1(1\u2212 \u03b1)\u2016w \u2212 v\u20162.\nWe will quantify the complexity of a hypothesis class by the means of Rademacher complexity [Bartlett and Mendelson, 2003]. In particular, the empirical Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis classH measured on the sample S and its expectation are defined as\nR\u0302S(H) := E \u03b5 [ sup h\u2208H 1 m m\u2211 i=1 \u03b5ih(xi) ] and R(H) := E S [ R\u0302S(H) ] .\nHere, \u03b5i is a random variable such that P(\u03b5i = 1) = P(\u03b5i = \u22121) = 12 . Similarly, as in the case of the risk, the Rademacher complexity is measured with respect to the probability distribution of the target domain, unless stated otherwise."}, {"heading": "4 Transferring from Auxiliary Hypotheses", "text": "In the following we will try to capture and generalize transfer learning problems that employ a collection of hypotheses as a prior knowledge, which originate from the different tasks. We will refer to the set of these given hypotheses as source hypotheses. These problems typically involve some criterion for source hypothesis selection and combination with the goal to increase performance on the target task. Indeed, some source hypotheses might come from tasks similar to the target task and the goal of a transfer learning algorithm is to select only relevant ones. In this work we will focus on the Regularized ERM formulations of such transfer learning problems. As an example of such, consider a common transfer learning problem: the least squares with biased regularization [Scho\u0308lkopf et al., 2001].\nLeast-Squares with Biased Regularization. Given the target training set S = {(xi, yi)}mi=1, source hypotheses {wsrci }ni=1 \u2282 H, parameters \u03b2 \u2208 Rn and \u03bb \u2208 R+, the algorithm generates the target hypothesis h(x) = \u3008w\u0302,x\u3009, where\nw\u0302 = argmin w\u2208H\n{ 1\nm m\u2211 i=1 (\u3008w,xi\u3009 \u2212 yi)2 + \u03bb \u2016w \u2212Wsrc\u03b2\u201622\n} . (1)\nThis problem has a simple intuitive interpretation: minimize the training error on the target training set while keeping the solution close to the linear combination of the source hypotheses. Indeed, one can naturally arrive at (1) from a probabilistic perspective. The solution w\u0302 is a maximum a posteriori estimate when the conditional distribution is Gaussian and the prior is a Wsrc\u03b2-mean, 1\u03bbI-covariance Gaussian distribution. Similar reasoning can be applied to other distributions from the exponential family, giving rise to different regularizers. Even though biased regularization is quite a simple idea, it found success in many transfer learning applications, ranging from computer vision [Kienzle and Chellapilla, 2006, Yang et al., 2007, Tommasi et al., 2010, Aytar and Zisserman, 2011, Kuzborskij et al., 2013, Tommasi et al., 2014] to NLP [Daume\u0301 III, 2007], to electromyography [Orabona et al., 2009, Tommasi et al., 2013].\nAlbeit practically appealing, the formulation (1) is limited in the fact that the source hypotheses must be a linear predictor living in the same space of the target predictor. Instead, we will assume that any source hypothesis shares only the input and output space with our target problem. In other words, we will see the source hypothesis as a \u201cblack box\u201d. Next, we formulate the general HTL problem that we will consider in the rest of the paper.\nHaving the source hypothesis set {hsrci }ni=1, we will be interested in target hypotheses of the form\nhw,\u03b2(x) := \u3008w,x\u3009+ hsrc\u03b2 (x), (2)\nwhere\nhsrc\u03b2 (x) := n\u2211 i=1 \u03b2ih src i (x) .\nIn the following we will pay special attention to a quantity that captures the performance of the source hypothesis combination hsrc\u03b2 (x) on the target domain\nRsrc := R(hsrc\u03b2 ).\nNow we formulate a problem that generalizes the biased regularization approach for transfer learning. We also generalize it in the choice of any non-negative smooth loss function and any strongly-convex regularizer. This puts our problem into the class of the ones that can be solved efficiently, yet endowed with interesting properties.\nHypothesis Transfer Learning through Regularized ERM. Let ` : Y \u00d7 Y 7\u2192 R+ be an H-smooth loss function and let \u2126 : H 7\u2192 R+ be a \u03c3-strongly convex function w.r.t. a norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016. Given the target training set S = {(xi, yi)}mi=1, source hypotheses {hsrci }ni=1, parameters \u03b2 obeying \u2126(\u03b2) \u2264 \u03c1, and \u03bb \u2208 R+, the algorithm generates the target hypothesis hw\u0302,\u03b2, such that\nw\u0302 = argmin w\u2208H\n{ 1\nm m\u2211 i=1 ` ( \u3008w,xi\u3009+ hsrc\u03b2 (x), yi ) + \u03bb\u2126(w)\n} . (3)\nClaim 1 Least-Squares with Biased Regularization is a special case of Hypothesis Transfer Learning through Regularized ERM.\nProof Introduce w\u2032, such that w\u2032 = w \u2212Wsrc\u03b2. Then we have that problem (1) is equivalent to\nmin w\u2208H\n{ 1\nm m\u2211 i=1 (\u3008w\u2032 + Wsrc\u03b2,xi\u3009 \u2212 yi) 2 + \u03bb \u2016w\u2032\u201622\n} ,\nthat in turn is a special version of (3) when hsrci (x) = \u3008wsrci ,x\u3009, we use the square loss, and \u2016 \u00b7 \u201622 as regularizer.\nNote that (3) is minimized only w.r.t. w, that is we do not analyze any particular algorithm that searches for the optimal weights of the source hypotheses. However, we assume that \u2126(\u03b2) \u2264 \u03c1, that is we constrain \u03b2 through a strongly convex function. Thus, we take into account potential regularized algorithms generating \u03b2, which include most of the empirical work in this field.\nOur analysis will focus on the generalization properties of hw\u0302,\u03b2, that is the solution to this HTL problem. In particular, our main goal will be to understand the impact of the source hypothesis combination on the performance of the target hypothesis. In our analysis we will discuss various regimes of interest, for example considering the perfect and arbitrarily bad source hypothesis. Our discussion will touch scenarios where the hypothesis transfer accelerates the learning and the conditions when we can provably expect perfect generalization. Finally, we will consider the consistency of Hypothesis Transfer Learning algorithms and pinpoint conditions when we achieve faster convergence to the performance of the best-in-the-class."}, {"heading": "5 Main Results", "text": "In this section, we present the main results of this work: generalization and excess risk bounds for the Hypothesis Transfer Learning through Regularized ERM. In the next section we discuss in detail the implications of these results, while we defer the proofs to the subsequent sections.\nThe first bound demonstrates the utility of the perfect combination of source hypotheses, while the second lets us observe the dependency on the arbitrary combination. In particular, the first bound explicitates the intuition that given the perfect source hypothesis learning is not required. In other words, whenRsrc = 0 we have that the empirical risk becomes equal to the risk with probability one. In addition, we present the second bound, implying a fast rate of the empirical risk convergence, subject to the quality of the source hypothesis combination.\nTheorem 2 Let hw\u0302,\u03b2 be generated by HTL through Regularized ERM, given the m-sized training set S sampled i.i.d. from the target domain, source hypotheses {hsrci : \u2016hsrci \u2016\u221e \u2264 1}ni=1, any source weights \u03b2 obeying \u2126(\u03b2) \u2264 \u03c1, and \u03bb \u2208 R+.

Specifically, we show an upper bound on the excess risk of the HTL through Regularized ERM, which depends on Rsrc, that is the risk of the combined source hypothesis hsrc\u03b2 on the target domain. We observe that for a small R\nsrc, the excess risk shrinks at a fast rate of O(1/m). In other words, a good prior knowledge guarantees not only good generalization, but also the fast recovery of the performance of the best hypothesis in the class.\nThis bound is similar in spirit to the results of localized complexities, as in works of Bartlett et al. [2005], Srebro et al. [2010a], however we focus on the HTL scenario rather than a generic learning setting. Later, in Section 5.1, we compare our bounds to these works and show that our analysis achieves superior results.\nTheorem 3 Let hw\u0302,\u03b2 be generated by HTL through Regularized ERM, given the m-sized training set S sampled i.i.d. from the target domain, source hypotheses {hsrci : \u2016hsrci \u2016\u221e \u2264 1}ni=1, any source weights \u03b2 obeying \u2126(\u03b2) \u2264 \u03c1, and \u03bb \u2208 R+.

Intuitively a good source hypothesis combination should facilitate transfer learning, while a reasonable algorithm must not fail if we provide it with the bad one. That said, a natural question to ask here is, what does it make a good or bad source hypothesis? As in previous works in transfer learning and domain adaptation, we capture this notion via a quantity that has two-fold interpretation: (1) the performance of the source hypothesis combination on the target domain; (2) relatedness of source and target domains. In the theorems presented in the previous sections we denoted it by Rsrc, that is the risk of the source hypothesis combination on the target domain. In this section we will consider various regimes of interest with respect to Rsrc. Namely, we will look into scenarios when it is a bad fit for the target task, a good one, and a perfect match, that is Rsrc = 0.\nWhen the source is a bad fit. First consider the case when the source hypothesis combination hsrc\u03b2 is useless for the purpose of transfer learning, for example, hsrc\u03b2 (x) = 0 for all x. This corresponds to learning with no auxiliary information. Then we can assume that Rsrc \u2264 M , and from Theorem 2 we obtain R(hw\u0302) \u2212 R\u0302S(hw\u0302) \u2264 O (1/( \u221a m\u03bb)). This rate matches the one in the analysis of regularized leastsquares [Vito et al., 2005, Bousquet and Elisseeff, 2002], that is a special case of the smooth loss function that the HTL through Regularized ERM employs. On the other hand, Srebro et al. [2010a] showed a better worst-case rate O(1/ \u221a m\u03bb). However, their framework builds upon a worst case Rademacher complexity which does not involve the expectation over the sample and does not lead to the dependency on Rsrc we have obtained in Theorem 2. We will discuss this problem in details later.\nWhen the source is a good fit. Here we would like to consider the behavior of the algorithm in the finitesample and asymptotic scenarios. We first look at the case when Rsrc is small for any finite m, in particular Rsrc = O(1/m). The fast rate term will dominate the bound, and we obtain the convergence rate of O(\u221a\u03c1/(m \u221a \u03bb)). In other words, we can expect a faster convergence for any finite number of samples when Rsrc is small. Furthermore, if we assume that \u03c1 = O(1/ \u221a m), the bound switches to the fast rate with the weaker assumptionRsrc = O(1/ \u221a m). Now consider the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm, particularly\nwhen m goes to infinity. In such case, the algorithm exhibits a rate of O ( Rsrc/ \u221a m\u03bb+ \u221a (Rsrc\u03c1)/m\u03bb ) ,\nso Rsrc governs the constant factor of the rate. Hence, the quantity Rsrc governs the finite sample and asymptotic behavior of the algorithm, predicting a faster convergence in both regimes when it is small.\nWhen source is a perfect fit. It is conceivable that the source hypothesis exploited is the perfect one, that is Rsrc = 0. In other words, the source hypothesis combination is a perfect predictor for the target domain. Theorem 2 implies that R(hw\u0302,\u03b2) = R\u0302S(hw\u0302,\u03b2) with probability one. We note that for many practically used smooth losses, such as square loss, this setting is only realistic if source and target domains match and the problem is noise-free. However, we can observe Rsrc = 0, for example, when the squared hinge loss, `(z, y) = max{0, 1 \u2212 zy}2, is used and all target domain examples are classified correctly by the source hypothesis combination, case that is not unthinkable for related domains.\nFast rates. There is a number of works in the literature investigating a rate of convergence faster than 1/ \u221a m subject to different conditions. In particular, the localized Rademacher complexity bounds of Bartlett et al. [2005] and Bousquet [2002] can be used to obtain results similar to the second inequality of Theorem 2. Indeed, Theorem 7 shows a bound which is very similar to the localized ones, albeit with two differences. The r.h.s. of the first inequality in Theorem 7 vanishes when the loss class has zero variance. Though intuitively trivial, this allows to prove a considerable result in the theory of transfer learning as it quantifies the intuition that no learning is necessary if the source has perfect performance on the target task. Second, by applying the standard localized Rademacher complexity bounds of Bousquet [2002], and assuming the use of the Lipschitz loss function, we do not achieve a fast rate of convergence, as can be seen from Theorem 13, shown in the Appendix. We suspect that assuming the smoothness of the loss function is crucial to prove fast rates in our formulation.\nFast rates for ERM with the smooth loss have been thoroughly analyzed by Srebro et al. [2010a]. Yet, the analysis of our HTL algorithm within their framework would yield a bound that is inferior to ours in two respects. The first concerns the scenario when the combined source hypothesis is perfect, that is Rsrc = 0. The generalization bound of Srebro et al. [2010a] does not offer a way to show that the empirical risk converges to the risk with probability one \u2013 instead one can only get a fast rate of convergence. The second problem is in the fact that such bound would depend on the empirical performance of combined source hypothesis. As we have noted before, the quantityRsrc is essential because it captures the degree of relatedness between two domains. In their bounds, one cannot obtain this relationship through the Rademacher complexity term as we did in our analysis. The reason for this is the stronger notion of Rademacher complexity that is employed by that framework, involving a supremum over the sample instead of an expectation. The expectation over the sample of the target distribution is crucial here, because it allows us to quantify how well the source domain is aligned with the target domain, through the source hypothesis acting as a link. However, one can attempt to obtain the bound on the empirical risk in terms ofRsrc. We prove such a bound in the Appendix, Theorem 11, and conclude that if one has a good source hypothesis or even a perfect one, the rate is O(1/ 4 \u221a m3), which is worse than ours."}, {"heading": "5.2 Comparison to Theories of Domain Adaptation and Transfer Learning", "text": "The setting in DA is different from the one we study, however, we will briefly discuss the theoretical relationship between the two. Typically in DA, one trains a hypothesis from an altered source training set, striving to achieve good performance on the target domain. The key question here is how to alter, or to adapt, the source training set. To answer this question, DA literature introduces the notion of domain relatedness, which quantifies the dissimilarities between the distributions of corresponding domains. Practically, in some cases the domain relatedness can be estimated through a large set of unlabeled samples drawn from both source and target domains. Theories of DA [Ben-David et al., 2010, Mansour et al., 2009, Ben-David and Urner, 2012, Mansour et al., 2008, Cortes and Mohri, 2014] have proposed a number of such domain relatedness criteria. Perhaps the most well known are the dH\u2206H-divergence [Ben-David et al., 2010] and its more general counterpart, the Discrepancy Distance [Mansour et al., 2009]. Typically, this divergence is explicitated in the generalization bound along with other terms controlling the generalization on the target domain. Let RDtrg(h) and RDsrc(h) denote the risks of the hypothesis h, measured w.r.t. the target and source distributions. Then a well-known result of Ben-David et al. [2010] suggests that for all h \u2208 H\nRDtrg(h) \u2264 RDsrc(h) + dH\u2206H(Dsrc,Dtrg) + \u03b5?H, (6)\nwhere \u03b5?H = minh\u2208H {RDtrg(h) +RDsrc(h)}. As we see, this result implies that adaptation is possible given that dH\u2206H(Dsrc,Dtrg) and \u03b5? are small. One can try to reduce those by controlling the complexity of the class H and by minimizing the divergence dH\u2206H(Dsrc,Dtrg). In practice the latter can be manipulated through an empirical counterpart on the basis of unlabeled samples. Increasing the complexity ofH indeed reduces \u03b5?, but inflates dH\u2206H(Dsrc,Dtrg). On the other hand, by minimizing dH\u2206H(Dsrc,Dtrg) alone puts us under the risk of increasing \u03b5?, since the empirical divergence is reduced without taking the labelling into account.\nClearly, this bound cannot be directly compared to our result, Theorem 2. However, we note the term Rsrc appearing in our results, which plays a role very similar to dH\u2206H in (6). In fact, by defining H = {x 7\u2192 \u3008\u03b2,hsrc(x)\u3009 : \u2126(\u03b2) \u2264 \u03c4}, where hsrc(x) = [hsrc1 (x), . . . , hsrcn (x)]>, and fixing h = hsrc\u03b2 \u2208 H in (6), we can write\nRsrc = RDtrg(h src \u03b2 ) \u2264 RDsrc(hsrc\u03b2 ) + dH\u2206H(Dsrc,Dtrg) + \u03b5?H.\nThis bound connects HTL criterion of domain relatedness, Rsrc, to that of domain adaptation. Plugging this into HTL generalization bound (5) and assuming that \u03bb \u2264 1 and \u03c1 \u2264 1/\u03bb we have for the target hypothesis h that\nRDtrg(h) \u2264 R\u0302S(h) +O\n( RDsrc(h\nsrc \u03b2 ) + dH\u2206H(Dsrc,Dtrg) + \u03b5?H\u221a\nm\u03bb +\n1\nm\u03bb\n) . (7)\nAlbeit this inequality shows the generalization ability of the transfer learning algorithm, comparing to (6), we observe that DA and HTL agree on the fact that the divergence between the domains has to be small to generalize well. In fact, in the HTL formulation we consider, the divergence is controlled in two ways: implicitly, by the choice of hsrc and through the complexity of classH, that is by choosing \u03c4 . Second, in DA we expect that hypothesis performs well on the target only if it performs well on the source. In HTL, this requirement is relaxed. As a side note, we observe that (7) captures an intuitive notion that a good source hypothesis has to perform well on its own domain. Finally, in the theory of DA ?H is assumed to be small. Indeed, if ?H is large, there is no hypothesis that is able to perform well on both domains simultaneously, and therefore adaptation is hopeless. In HTL the algorithm can still generalize even with large ?H, however this is due to the supervised nature of the framework.\nWe now turn our attention to the previous theoretical works studying HTL-related settings. Few papers have addressed the theory of transfer learning, where the only information passed from the source domain is the classifier or regressor. Mansour et al. [2008] have addressed the problem of multiple source hypotheses combination, however, in a different HTL setting. Specifically, in addition to the source hypotheses, the learner receives the unlabeled samples drawn from the source distributions, that ared used to weight and combine these source hypotheses. The authors have presented a general theory of such a scenario and did not study the generalization properties of any particular algorithm. The first analysis of the generalization ability of HTL in the similar context we consider here was done by Kuzborskij and Orabona [2013b,a]. The work focused on the L2-regularized least squares and the generalization bound involving the leaveone-out risk instead of the empirical one. The following result, obtained through an algorithmic stability argument [Bousquet and Elisseeff, 2002], holds with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4\nR(h) \u2264 R\u0302looS (h) +O\n( 4 \u221a Rsrc\u221a\nm\u03b4\u03bb0.75\n) , (8)\nwhere Rsrc is the risk of a single fixed source hypothesis and h is the solution of a Regularized Least Square problem. We first observe that the shape of the bound is similar to the one obtained in this work, although with the number of differences. First, the bound assumes the use of a fixed source hypothesis, that is not even weighted by any coefficient. In practice, this is a very strong assumption, as one can receive an arbitrarily bad source and have no way to exclude it. Our formulation, HTL through Regularized ERM, and the corresponding generalization bounds of Theorem 2 take into account the weighting of multiple source hypotheses. This is a much more powerful concept, since we address HTL algorithms that can select and weight subsets of source hypotheses that are well aligned with a target task. Second, the bound (8) seems to have a vanishing behavior whenever the risk of the source Rsrc is equal to zero. This comes at the cost of the use of a weaker concentration inequality. In Theorem 2 we manage to obtain the same behavior with high probability. Finally, we get a better dependency on Rsrc. In addition to generalization bounds, in this work we also prove novel high probability excess risk bounds."}, {"heading": "6 Technical Results and Proofs", "text": "In this section we present general technical results that are used to prove our theorems.\nFirst, we present the Rademacher complexity generalization bound in Theorem 7, which slightly differs from the usual ones. The difference comes in the assumption that the variance of the loss is uniformly bounded over the hypothesis class. This will allow us to state a generalization bound that obeys the fast empirical risk convergence rate subject to the small class complexity. Second, we will also show a generalization bound with the confidence term that vanishes if the complexity of the class is exactly zero. In other words, for the class with zero complexity, the empirical risk becomes equal to the risk with probability one.\nNext, we focus on the Rademacher complexity of the smooth loss function class. Similarly as in previous works [Srebro et al., 2010a], we exploit additional information about the behavior of the hypothesis coming from the gradient of the loss function. This allows us to prove a bound on the empirical Rademacher complexity of a hypothesis class, Lemma 8, that depends on the point-wise bounds on the loss function. This contrasts with Srebro et al. [2010a], who consider smooth losses as well, but use a much more restrictive notion of Rademacher complexity. This novel bound might be of independent interest. Finally, we employ this result to analyze the effect of the source hypotheses on the complexity of the target hypothesis class in Theorem 10."}, {"heading": "6.1 Fast Rate Generalization Bound", "text": "The proof of fast-rate and vanishing-confidence-term bounds, Theorem 7, stems from the functional generalization of Bennett\u2019s inequality which is due to Bousquet [2002, Theorem 2.11] and that we report here for completeness.\nTheorem 4 (Bousquet [2002]) Let X1, X2, . . . , Xm be identically distributed random variables according to D.

Namely, we will show an upper bound on the random variable suph\u2208H { R(h)\u2212 R\u0302S(h) } .

Consider the random variable\nZ := m\n2M sup h\u2208H\n{ R(h)\u2212 R\u0302S(h) } .\nUsing Theorem 4, we have P ( m\n2M sup h\u2208H\n{ R(h)\u2212 R\u0302S(h) } \u2265 m 2M E [ sup h\u2208H { R(h)\u2212 R\u0302S(h) }] + t ) \u2264 exp ( \u2212vu ( t v )) , (11)\nwhere,\nv = m\u03c32 + m M E [ sup h\u2208H { R(h)\u2212 R\u0302S(h) }] , (12)\n\u03c32 \u2265 sup h\u2208H Var(x,y)\n[ 1\n2M\n( `(h(x), y)\u2212 E\n(x\u2032,y\u2032) [`(h(x\u2032), y\u2032)]\n)] .\nWe now need two things: invert the r.h.s. of (11), treating it as a function of t, and provide an upper-bound on v. For the first part, recall that u(y) = (1 + y) log(1 + y) \u2212 y. To give an upper-bound of t, we apply Lemma 5 with a = tv , and b = 1 v\u03b7.

(14)\nNext we prove the bound on v. We first show that the variance of centered loss function, \u03c32, is uniformly bounded by the Rademacher complexity. From the definition of variance we have\nsup h\u2208H E (x,y)\n[ 1\n4M2\n( `(h(x), y)\u2212 E\n(x\u2032,y\u2032) [`(h(x\u2032), y\u2032)] )2] \u2264 sup h\u2208H 1 4M2 E (x,y) [`(h(x), y)2]\n\u2264 sup h\u2208H\n1\n2M E (x,y) [|`(h(x), y)|] = \u03c32 = sup\nh\u2208H\n1\n2M R(h) =\nr\n2M .

[2012]) If \u2126 is \u03c3 strongly convex w.r.t. \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 and \u2126?(0) = 0, then, denoting the partial sum \u2211 j\u2264i vj by v1:i, we have for any sequence v1, . . . ,vm and for any u,\nm\u2211 i=1 \u3008vi,u\u3009 \u2212 \u2126(u) \u2264 \u2126?(v1:m) \u2264 m\u2211 i=1 \u3008\u2207\u2126?(v1:i\u22121),vi\u3009+ 1 2\u03c3 m\u2211 i=1 \u2016vi\u20162? .\nNow we are ready to give the proofs of the Rademacher complexity results.\nTheorem 10 Let \u2126 be a non-negative \u03c3-strongly convex function w.r.t. a norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016, and let 0 be its minimizer. Let risk and empirical risk be defined w.r.t. an H-smooth loss function ` : Y \u00d7 Y 7\u2192 R+. Finally, given the set of functions {fi : X 7\u2192 Y}ni=1 with f(x) := [f1(x), . . . , fn(x)]>, a combination f\u03b2(x) = \u3008\u03b2, f(x)\u3009, a scalar \u03b1 > 0, and any sample S drawn i.i.d. from distribution over X \u00d7 Y , define classes\nW = { w : \u2126(w) \u2264 \u03b1R\u0302S(f\u03b2) } , V = {\u03b2 : \u2126(\u03b2) \u2264 \u03c1} ,\nand the loss class L = {(x, y) 7\u2192 `(\u3008w,x\u3009+ f\u03b2(x), y) : w \u2208 W \u2227 \u03b2 \u2208 V} .\nThen for the loss class L, setting constants supx\u2208X \u2016x\u2016? \u2264 B and supx\u2208X \u2016f(x)\u2016? \u2264 C, we have that\nR(L) \u2264 4 \u221a 3H(B + C) ( 1 + \u221a 2HB2\u03b1\n\u03c3\n) R(f\u03b2) \u221a \u03b1+ \u221a R(f\u03b2)\u03c1\u221a\nm\u03c3 .\nProof The core of the proof consists in an application of Lemma 8. In particular, Lemma 8 allows us to introduce additional information about the loss class by providing bounds on the loss at each example. We will bound the loss at each example using the definition of smoothness, extracting the empirical risk of hypothesis R\u0302S(f\u03b2). The last step is to give an upper-bound on the empirical Rademacher complexity of a class regularized by a strongly convex function. We follow the proof of Kakade et al. [2012, Theorem 7] to accomplish this task. First define the classes\nHW := {x 7\u2192 \u3008w,x\u3009 : w \u2208 W} , HV := {f\u03b2 : \u03b2 \u2208 V} ,\nand also define altered sample S\u2032 := {\u221a\u03c4ixi}mi=1, where \u03c4i is a quantity independent fromW and V . We apply Lemma 8 with the loss class L and the property of Rademacher complexities for the sums of function classes [Bartlett and Mendelson, 2003] to show that\nR\u0302S(L) \u2264 2 \u221a 3H ( R\u0302S\u2032(HW) + R\u0302S\u2032(HV) ) .\nHaving this, we will follow the proof of Kakade et al. [2012, Theorem 7] to bound the empirical Rademacher complexities R\u0302S\u2032(HW) and R\u0302S\u2032(HV) with quantities of interest. Let t > 0 and apply Lemma 9 with u = w and vi = t\u03b5i \u221a \u03c4ixi to get\nsup w\u2208W { m\u2211 i=1 \u3008w, t\u03b5i \u221a \u03c4ixi\u3009 } \u2264 t 2 2\u03c3 m\u2211 i=1 \u2016\u03b5i \u221a \u03c4ixi\u20162? + sup w\u2208W \u2126(w) + m\u2211 i=1 \u3008\u2207\u2126?(v1:i\u22121), \u03b5i \u221a \u03c4ixi\u3009\n\u2264 t 2B2\n2\u03c3 m\u2211 i=1 |\u03c4i|+ \u03b1R\u0302S(f) + m\u2211 i=1 \u3008\u2207\u2126?(v1:i\u22121), \u03b5i \u221a \u03c4ixi\u3009 .\nNow take expectation w.r.t. all the \u03b5i on both sides. The left hand side is mtR\u0302S\u2032(HW) and the last term on the right hand side becomes zero since E[\u03b5i] = 0. Denoting r = 1m \u2211m i=1 |\u03c4i| and multiplying through by\n1 mt , we get\nR\u0302S\u2032(HW) \u2264 B2rt\n2\u03c3 +\n\u03b1\nmt R\u0302S(f\u03b2).\nProving analogously for R\u0302S\u2032(HV), we get that\nR\u0302S(L) \u2264 2 \u221a 3H\n( (B2 + C2)rt\n\u03c3 + \u03b1R\u0302S(f\u03b2) + \u03c1 mt\n) .\nOptimizing over t gives us\nR\u0302S(L) \u2264 4 \u221a 3H(B + C)\n\u221a r(\u03b1R\u0302S(f\u03b2) + \u03c1)\nm\u03c3 .\nNow focus on the upper bound of r. First we obtain bounds on each \u03c4i. We start with the bound on the loss function, exploiting smoothness. Let `(\u3008w,x\u3009 + f\u03b2(x), y) = \u03c6(\u3008w,x\u3009 + f\u03b2(x)), where \u03c6 : R 7\u2192 R is an H-smooth function. From the definition of smoothness [Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014, (12.5)], we have that for all w and v\n\u03c6(\u3008w,x\u3009+ f\u03b2(x)) \u2264 \u03c6(\u3008v,x\u3009+ f\u03b2(x)) + \u03c6\u2032(\u3008v,x\u3009+ f\u03b2(x)) \u3008w \u2212 v,x\u3009+ H\n2 \u3008w \u2212 v,x\u30092 \u2264 \u03c6(\u3008v,x\u3009+ f\u03b2(x)) + 2 \u221a H\u03c6(\u3008v,x\u3009+ f\u03b2(x))\u2016w \u2212 v\u2016\u2016x\u2016? + H\n2 \u2016w \u2212 v\u20162\u2016x\u20162?. (17)\nTo obtain the last inequality we used the generalized Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the fact that for an H-smooth non-negative function \u03c6, we have that |\u03c6\u2032(t)| \u2264 \u221a 4H\u03c6(t), [Srebro et al., 2010a, Lemma 2.1].\nNow recall a property of a \u03c3-strongly-convex function F , that holds for its minimizer v and any w [ShalevShwartz and Ben-David, 2014, Lemma 13.5],\n\u2016w \u2212 v\u20162 \u2264 2 \u03c3 (F (w)\u2212 F (v)).\nSince inequality (17) holds for any v, set v = 0, which is also the minimizer of \u2126(\u00b7), apply aforementioned property to get\n\u03c6(\u3008w,x\u3009+ f\u03b2(x)) \u2264 \u03c6(f\u03b2(x)) + 2 \u221a 2H\n\u03c3 \u03c6(f\u03b2(x))\u2126(w)\u2016x\u2016? +\nH \u03c3 \u2126(w)\u2016x\u20162?\n\u21d2 `(\u3008w,xi\u3009+ f\u03b2(xi), yi) \u2264 \u03c4i = `(f\u03b2(xi), yi) + \u221a 8HB2\u03b1\n\u03c3 R\u0302S(f\u03b2)`(f\u03b2(xi), yi) +\nHB2\u03b1\n\u03c3 R\u0302S(f\u03b2).\n(18)\nThe last inequality comes from the definition of the classH.

To show the statement we will apply Theorem 7. In particular, we will consider any choice of w and \u03b2 within the set induced by a strongly-convex function \u2126. To apply Theorem 7, we need to upper bound the Rademacher complexity of the loss class L and also the quantity r = supf\u2208L E(x,y)[f(x, y)].\nWe obtain the bound on Rademacher complexity by applying Theorem 10. First define the loss class L := {(x, y) 7\u2192 `(h, y) : h \u2208 H} , and hypothesis class\nH := { x 7\u2192 \u3008w,x\u3009+ hsrc\u03b2 (x) : \u2126(w) \u2264 1\n\u03bb R\u0302S(h\nsrc \u03b2 ) \u2227 \u2126(\u03b2) \u2264 \u03c1 \u2227 R\u0302S(hw,\u03b2) \u2264 R\u0302S(hsrc\u03b2 )\n} .\nTo motivate the choice for the constraints observe that for\nw\u0302 = argmin w\n{ R\u0302S(hw,\u03b2) + \u03bb\u2126(w) } ,\nwe have \u2126(w\u0302) \u2264 \u03bb\u22121R\u0302S(h0,\u03b2) = \u03bb\u22121R\u0302S(hsrc\u03b2 ), and R\u0302S(hw\u0302,\u03b2) \u2264 R\u0302S(hsrc\u03b2 ). That said, by applying Theorem 10 with \u03b1 = 1\u03bb and f\u03b2 = h src \u03b2 and assuming that \u03bb \u2264 \u03ba, we obtain\nR(L) \u2264 O ( Rsrc\u03ba\u221a m\u03bb + \u221a Rsrc\u03c1\u03ba2 m\u03bb ) .\nNext we obtain the bound on r\nr = sup h\u2208H E (x,y) [`(h(x), y)] = sup h\u2208H E S\n[ R\u0302S(h) ] \u2264 E\nS [ sup h\u2208H R\u0302S(h) ] \u2264 E S [R\u0302S(h src \u03b2 )] = R src.\nThe last two inequalities come from Jensen\u2019s inequality and the definition of the class H.

In particular, our formulation stems from the regularized Empirical Risk Minimization principle with the choice of any non-negative smooth loss function and any strongly convex regularizer. Theoretically we have analyzed the generalization ability and excess risk of this family of HTL algorithms. Our analysis showed that a good source hypothesis combination facilitates faster generalization, specifically in O(1/m) instead of the usual O(1/ \u221a m). Furthermore, given a perfect source hypothesis combination, our analysis is consistent with the intuition that learning is not required. As a byproduct of our investigation, we came up with new results in Rademacher complexity analysis of the smooth loss classes, that could be of independent interest.\nOur conclusions suggest the key importance of a source hypothesis selection procedure. Indeed, when the HTL algorithm is provided with enormous pool of source hypotheses, how to select relevant ones on the basis of only few labeled examples? This might sound similar to the feature selection problem under the condition that n m, however, earlier empirical studies by Tommasi et al. [2014] with hundreds of sources did not find much corroboration for this hypothesis when applying L1 regularization. Thus, it remains unclear if having few good sources from hundreds is a reasonable assumption. Another interesting practical possibility is the design of strongly convex regularizers tailored for transfer learning.

However, we cannot use Theorem 1 of Srebro et al. [2010a] since it is not symmetric. Instead we will use a similar localized bound of Bartlett et al. [2005, Corollary 3.5]. In order to apply it, we have to obtain an upper bound on the Rademacher complexity of the loss class L that is a sub-root function [Bousquet, 2002, Definition 4.1].

E[\u00b7] have\nR(L) \u2264M \u221a 2Rsrc\nm\u03bb\u03c3 +M\n\u221a 2\u03c1\nm\u03c3 .\nSince upper bound is a sub-root function of Rsrc, we obtain it\u2019s fixed point r? as required by Corollary 3.5 and conclude that r? \u2264 \u221a 2M2\u03c1\nm\u03c3 +\n2M2 m\u03bb\u03c3 + 2M 4\n\u221a 8\u03c1\nm3\u03bb2\u03c33 .\nNow we apply Corollary 3.5 and for any K > 0 we have with probability at least 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b7, \u2200\u03b7 \u2265 0 the following holds\nR\u0302S(hw\u0302,\u03b2) \u2264 K ( Rsrc + \u221a M2\u03c1\nm\u03c3 +\nM2\nm\u03bb\u03c3 +M 4\n\u221a \u03c1\nm3\u03bb2\u03c33 +\n1 + \u03b7\nm\n) .\nAll that is left to do is to apply Theorem 1 of Srebro et al. [2010a] to have\nR(hw\u0302,\u03b2) \u2264 R\u0302S(hw\u0302,\u03b2) + O\u0303\n((\u221a Rsrc\nm +\n4\n\u221a M2\u03c1\nm3\u03c3 +\nM\nm \u221a \u03bb\u03c3 + 8\n\u221a M2\u03c1\nm7\u03bb2\u03c33 +\n\u221a 1 + \u03b7\nm\n) \u00d7\n\u00d7\n(\u221a M\u03ba\n\u03bb + \u221a \u03ba\u03c1+\n\u221a M\u03b7 ) + M\u03ba\nm\u03bb + \u03ba\u03c1 m\n) .\nUsing the assumption on \u03bb, we get the stated result.\nA.1 Guarantees using Localized Rademacher Complexity Bounds The following theorem is due to Bousquet [2002, Theorem 6.1]. In particular, we state the inequality appearing prior to the last in the proof, as it better serves our purpose.\nTheorem 12 (Bousquet [2002]) Let F be a class of non-negative functions such that \u2016f\u2016\u221e \u2264 M almost surely. Let \u03c6m be a function defined on [0,\u221e) that is non-negative, non-decreasing, not identically zero, and such that \u03c6m(r)/ \u221a r is non-increasing. Moreover let \u03c6m be such that for all r > 0\nR\u0302S(F) \u2264 \u03c6m(r).\nDefine r?m as the largest solution of the equation \u03c6m(r) = r.Then, for all \u03b7 > 0, with probability at least 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b7 for all f \u2208 F and any {Xi}mi=1 drawn i.i.d.\nE X [f(X)] \u2264 1 m m\u2211 i=1 f(Xi)+45r ? m+ \u221a 8r?m E X [f(X)]+\n\u221a 4M(\u03b7 + 6 log logm)EX [f(X)]\nm +\n20M(\u03b7 + 6 log logm)\nm .\nThe following HTL generalization bound is shown using Theorem 12.\nTheorem 13 Let hw\u0302,\u03b2 be generated by HTL through Regularized ERM, given the m-sized training set S sampled i.i.d. from the target domain, source hypotheses {hsrci }ni=1, any source weights \u03b2 obeying \u2126(\u03b2) \u2264 \u03c1, and \u03bb \u2208 R+. Assume that ` is a L-Lipschitz loss function and `(hw\u0302,\u03b2(x), y) \u2264 M for any (x, y) and any training set. Then we have with probability at least 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b7, \u2200\u03b7 \u2265 0\nR(hw\u0302,\u03b2) \u2264 R\u0302S(hw\u0302,\u03b2)+O\u0303\n( L2 + L\nm\u03bb\u03c3 + L\n\u221a \u03c1\nm\u03c3 +\n\u221a Rsrc(L2 + L)\nm\u03bb\u03c3 + \u221a Rsrc 4\n\u221a L2\u03c1\nm\u03c3 +\n\u221a RsrcM\u03b7\nm + M\u03b7 m\n) .\n(23)\nProof The core of the proof is an application of Theorem 12. In particular, we have to obtain the fixed point r?m and upper bound R(h) with the risk of the source hypothesis R\nsrc. Considering the L-Lipschitz loss class of Theorem 12 to be L := {(x, y) 7\u2192 `(h(x), y) : h \u2208 H}, we have the relationship R\u0302S(L) \u2264 LR\u0302S(H) via Talagrand\u2019s lemma [Mohri et al., 2012, Lemma 4.2]. Furthermore, let the hypothesis class be\nH = { x 7\u2192 \u3008w,x\u3009+ hsrc\u03b2 (x) : \u2126(w) \u2264 1\n\u03bb R\u0302S(h\nsrc \u03b2 ) \u2227 \u2126(\u03b2) \u2264 \u03c1 \u2227 R\u0302S(hw,\u03b2) \u2264 R\u0302S(hsrc\u03b2 )\n} .\nThe motivation for the choice of constraints comes from the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 2. That said, we obtain the upper bound\nR\u0302S(L) \u2264 L \u221a 2Rsrc\nm\u03bb\u03c3 + L\n\u221a 2\u03c1\nm\u03c3 .\nBoth terms come by applying Theorem 7 by Kakade et al. [2012]. In the first term we set fmax = Rsrc and in the second fmax = \u03c1. Now define function \u03c6m(r) = L \u221a 2r m\u03bb\u03c3 + L \u221a 2\u03c1 m\u03c3 , and observe that it verifies the\ncondition of Theorem 12. Next, to obtain the upper bound on r?m, we solve L \u221a 2r m\u03bb\u03c3 + 2\u03c1 m\u03c3 \u2264 r and get\nthat r?m \u2264 L(L+1) m\u03bb\u03c3 + L \u221a 2\u03c1 m\u03c3 . As in Theorem 2, we also get that R(h) \u2264 R\nsrc. Plugging r?m and the bound on R(h) into Theorem 12, we have the statement."}], "references": [{"title": "Tabula rasa: Model transfer for object category detection", "author": ["Y. Aytar", "A.

In this work we considerably extend and generalize the theory of HTL. Our contributions. We formulate a general Hypothesis Transfer Learning problem through regularized Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) with respect to any non-negative smooth loss function and any strongly convex regularizer. For its solution we prove high-probability generalization bounds that exhibit fast rate, i.e. O(1/m), of convergence whenever any weighted combination of multiple source hypotheses performs well on the target task. In other words, we show theoretically that HTL facilitates a faster generalization. In addition, we show that, if the combination is perfect, the error on the training set becomes the error we observe on the whole target distribution. Furthermore, we analyze an excess risk of our formulation, and conclude that a good source hypothesis also speeds up the convergence to the performance of the bestin-the-class. As a byproduct of our study, we prove an upper bound on the Rademacher complexity of a smooth loss class that provides extra information compared to that of Lipschitz loss classes.
