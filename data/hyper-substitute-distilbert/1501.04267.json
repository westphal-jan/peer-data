However, the accuracy of this algorithm heavily depend on the threshold value of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc50.

[2] proposed the method to calculate potential of every point using Gaussian function in data field. For a dataset {\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652, \ud835\udc653, \u22ef , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b}, the equation to calculate the potential of every point is:\n\ud835\udf11(\ud835\udc65) = \u2211 (\ud835\udc52 \u2212(\n\u2016\ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u2016\n\ud835\udf0e )\n2\n)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56=1 (1)\nEquation (1) is very similar to the equation that is used to calculate density in [1]. In data field, data points with larger potential located in the dense region. As shown in Figure 1, (a) shows the distribution of potential of data field, dark areas have larger potential. This is same with the density distribution of original data as shown in (b). Therefore, potential of data field and the density of points in [1] have the same effect.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure1. The potential distribution of data field\nBased on above analysis, the threshold value \" \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc50 \" in [1] can be calculated in the same way which is used to optimize the impact factor \u03c3 in data field. According to data field, if the potential of data is all the same, then the uncertainty of data distribution is the largest; if potential is uneven distributed, then the uncertainty is the smallest and potential can reflect the distribution of data. The uncertainty of data is usually represented by entropy, so we can use the entropy to optimize impact factor \u03c3.\nFor a dataset {\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652, \ud835\udc653, \u22ef , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b} , the potential of every point is {\u03c61, \u03c62, \u03c63, \u22ef , \u03c6n}, the equation to calculate entropy H in data field is:\n\ud835\udc3b = \u2212 \u2211 \ud835\udf11\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc4d\n\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54 (\n\ud835\udf11\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc4d ) (2)\nIn Equation (2), \ud835\udc4d = \u2211 \ud835\udf11\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56=1 is a normalization factor. For dataset used in Figure 1, the change of entropy with different \u03c3 is shown in Figure 2.\nIn Figure 2, As \u03c3 growing from 0 to \u221e, the value of entropy decreases quickly at first, then increases slowly and finally maintains the same level. When the value of entropy is the smallest, the value of \u03c3 is 0.9531. With this \u03c3, the distribution of potential in data field is shown as Figure 1, which reflects the distribution of data very well. As mentioned above, we should choose the value of \u03c3 when the entropy is the smallest.\nIn data field, according to the 3B rule of Gaussian distribution [3], the influence radius is 3\n\u221a2 \ud835\udf0e for every point. As a clustering algorithm, one\npoint can only affect the points located inside its influence radius, so we take 3\n\u221a2 \u03c3 as a threshold value."}, {"heading": "2 Experimental results and comparison", "text": "Our method is used to redo the experiments in [1] on the same experimental datasets used in [1].

The fourth column is the clustering results with threshold that calculated by data field.

The number of removed noisy points and threshold are shown in Table 1.\nIn Table 1, for dataset (a), (b), (d), which contains noisy points, our proposed method can remove more noisy points. For dataset (c), which does not contain any noisy points, data field method removed less non-noisy points. And in dataset (c), the threshold of original algorithm is\nsimilar to data field method.
