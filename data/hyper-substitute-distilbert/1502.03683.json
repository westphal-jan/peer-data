In his Modeling Bounded Rationality, he admits that Game Theory is still far away from achieving this result. \"Modeling games with limited foresight remains a great challenge\" and the frameworks studied thus far \"fall short of capturing the spirit of limited-foresight reasoning\" (Rubinstein, 2004, p.134).\nOur contribution. We study a game-theoretic framework where players might not be able to foresee the consequence of their strategic decisions all the way up to the terminal nodes and evaluate intermediate nodes according to some pre-established and possibly incorrect\nar X\niv :1\n50 2.\n03 68\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 2\nheuristics. On top of that they can reason about other players\u2019 limited foresight and evaluation criteria: they are endowed with higher-order beliefs about what their opponents can perceive of the game and how they evaluate it, beliefs about what their opponents believe the others can see and how the evaluate it, and so forth.\nTo analyse these novel structures, we propose a new solution concept which combines higher-order reasoning about players\u2019 limited foresight and evaluation criteria. The guiding principle for players\u2019 behaviour is that each of them chooses a strategy in the game she sees that is a best response to the belief about what the other players can see and how they evaluate it. We show constructively (Algorithms 1-4) that this solution concept always exists (Theorem 1) and is a strict generalization of other known ones, e.g., backwards induction. As we will observe, the potentially unbounded chain of beliefs underlying our rationality constraints can be finitely represented and - rather surprisingly - effectively resolved (Proposition 16). There is a logical background to this in fixed-point logics of belief, that we will also briefly touch upon.\nRelated literature. In recent years an innovative tradition has emerged in game theory, aiming at capturing situations in which players are unaware of parts of the game they are playing and might even think to be playing a different game from the real one. Halpern and R\u00eago (Halpern and R\u00eago, 2006), for instance, study models of unawareness of elements of the game played (e.g., other players). Yossi Feinberg (Feinberg, 2012) approaches similar problems from a syntactic perspective. Simultaneously, the interplay between belief and awareness in interactive situations is analysed in a series of papers by Heifetz, Meier and Schipper (Heifetz et al., 2006), (Heifetz et al., 2013a), (Heifetz et al., 2013b).\nA game-theoretic framework that comes closest, perhaps, to capturing the practical aspects of game play is Games with Short Sight (Grossi and Turrini, 2012), a well-behaved fragment of Halpern and R\u00eago\u2019s games with awareness, in which players of an extensive game make choices without knowing the consequences of their actions and base their decisions on a (possibly incorrect) evaluation of intermediate game positions.\nGames with Short Sight (GSSs) have been studied in relation with a solution concept called sight-compatible backwards induction: as players might not be able to calculate all possible moves up to the terminal nodes, they play rationally in a local sense, executing moves that are backwards induction moves in their own sight, therefore safely assuming their opponents see as much of the game as they do.\nHowever, sight-compatible backwards induction precludes any sort of opponent modelling, as players are not allowed to have a non-trivial belief about what their opponents perceive. Thus, the tools developed in (Grossi and Turrini, 2012) to analyse GSSs only allow players to play approximately or inaccurately, they don\u2019t allow players to exploit their opponents\u2019 believed weaknesses. What we do here in a nutshell is to overcome the strong rationality requirements in (Grossi and Turrini, 2012) by introducing a significantly higher level of complexity in players\u2019 reasoning which, it turns out, still remains computationally manageable. We believe that our approach offers a novel intermediate level in between simple backward induction and type spaces or other potentially highly complex models of games.\nPaper Structure Section 2 introduces useful formal notation and definitions from the literature upon which we build, e.g., Games with Short Sight. Section 3 defines our central higher-order extension thereof, Epistemic Games with Short Sight. In particular, we go on to define a new solution concept which takes this higher-order dimension into account, and we then show the existence of the new equilibria by means of an effective (P-TIME) algorithm. Section 4 summarises our findings, and hints at new research avenues opening up in our\nframework."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section we recall some standard terminology which will be useful later on: extensive games of perfect information (Osborne and Rubinstein, 1994), sight functions and sight restrictions (Grossi and Turrini, 2012)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Extensive Games", "text": "An extensive game form (Osborne and Rubinstein, 1994) is a tuple\n(N,H, t,\u03a3i, o)\nwhere [1] N is a finite non-empty set of players. [2] H is a non-empty prefix-closed set of sequences, called histories, drawn from a set A of actions. A history (ak)k=1,...,K \u2208 H is called terminal history if it is infinite or if there is no aK+1 such that (ak)k=1,...,K+1 \u2208 H. The set of terminal histories is denoted Z. A history h is instead called quasi-terminal if for each a \u2208 A, if (h, a) \u2208 H, then (h, a) is terminal. If h \u2208 H is a prefix (resp., strict prefix) of h\u2032 \u2208 H we write h h\u2032 (resp., h h\u2032). With Ah = {a \u2208 A | (h, a) \u2208 H} we denote the set of actions following the history h. The restriction of H \u2032 \u2286 H to h \u2208 H, i.e., {(h, h\u2032) \u2208 H | (h, h\u2032) \u2208 H \u2032} is denoted H \u2032|h. [3]t : H \\ Z \u2192 N is a turn function, which assigns a player to each non-terminal history, i.e., the player who moves at that history. [4] \u03a3i is a non-empty set of strategies. A strategy of player i is function \u03c3i : {h \u2208 H\\Z | t(h) = i} \u2192 Ah (assigns an action in Ah to each non-terminal history for which t(h) = i). [5] o is the outcome function. For each strategy profile \u03c3 = \u220f i\u2208N (\u03c3i), the outcome o(\u03c3) of \u03a3 is the terminal history that results when each player i follows the precepts of \u03c3i. An extensive game is a tuple E = (G, i), where G is an extensive game form, and\ni\u2286 Z\u00d7Z is a total preorder over Z, for each player i. We denote BI(E) the set of backwards induction histories of extensive game E , computed with the standard procedure (Osborne and Rubinstein, 1994, Proposition 99.2)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Games with Short Sight", "text": "Games with Short Sight (GSSs) are a representation of extensive games from the point of view of resource-bounded players. On top of the extensive game structure, each player moving at the certain point in the game is endowed with a set of histories that he or she can see from then on, and with evaluation criteria, to compare non-terminal histories. We start by defining the latter.\nDefinition 1 (Priority Sequences) Consider an extensive game form G=(N,H, t,\u03a3i, o). A priority sequence,or P -sequence, for G is a tuple P =(H, ) where: [1] H \u2286 \u2118(H) and H is finite, i.e., H is a finite set of sets of histories. Elements of H are denoted H,H\u2032 . . . and called properties . [2] \u2286 H2 is a strict linear order on properties in H. To say that H is preferred to H\u2032, for H,H\u2032 \u2208 H, we write H H\u2032. We denote the set of all P-sequences over a set of histories H as PH .\nPriority sequences (Liu, 2011) are an abstract qualitative representation of preferenceinducing evaluation criteria, of a type also studied in the decision-theoretic literature (Dietrisch and List, 2013). Classical preferences over H2 are induced as follows:\nDefinition 2 (Preferences) Let G = (N,H, t,\u03a3i, o) be an extensive game form and P =(H, ), a P -sequence for G. The preference relation P \u2286 H2 over the set of histories of G induced by g is defined as follows:\nh P h\u2032 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200H \u2208 H : [IF h\u2032 \u2208 H THEN h \u2208 H OR \u2203H\u2032 \u2208 H : [H\u2032 H AND h \u2208 H\u2032 AND h\u2032 6\u2208 H\u2032]]\nA prioritised game (Grossi and Turrini, 2012) is a tuple GP = (N,H, t,\u03a3i, o, Pi), where Pi is a P -sequence for extensive game G = (N,H, t,\u03a3i, o).\nPrioritised games represent players\u2019 evaluation of all game positions. When looking at two histories that a player can access in her calculations, she will compare them using the criteria in her P-sequence, that can encompass much more than just pay-offs. To represent their calculation boundaries at each choice point we use sight functions (Grossi and Turrini, 2012).\nDefinition 3 (Sight function) Consider a prioritised game GP = (N,H, t,\u03a3i, o,Pi). A (short) sight function for GP is a function s : H\\Z \u2192 2H\\\u2205, associating to each non-terminal history h a finite non-empty and prefix-closed subset of all the histories extending h.\nIntuitively, the sight function associates any choice point with those histories that the player playing at that choice point can see. A game with short sight (GSS) is a tuple S = (GP , s) where GP is a prioritised game and s a sight function for GP . A GSS, intuitively, is built upon a number of extensive form games.\nDefinition 4 (Sight-restricted game) Let the pair S = (GP , s) be a prioritised game with short sight, where GP = (N,H, t,\u03a3i, o, Pi). Moreover, let h \u2208 H\\Z. Then a sight-restricted game is a tuple\nSds(h)= (Nds(h), Hds(h), tds(h),\u03a3ids(h), ods(h), ids(h))\nwhere [1] Nds(h)= {i \u2208 N | t(h, h\u2032) = i for some (h, h\u2032) \u2208 s(h)}; [2] Hds(h)= s(h) The set Zds(h) denotes the histories in Hds(h) of maximal length, i.e., the terminal histories in s(h); [3] tds(h)= t|s(h), i.e., tds(h) is a restriction of the turn function to the histories in s(h); [4] \u03a3ids(h) is the set of strategies available, for each player i, at h and restricted to s(h). Its elements \u03c3ids(h) satisfy \u03c3ids(h)(h, h\u2032) = \u03c3i(h, h\u2032) for each (h, h\u2032, \u03c3i(h, h\u2032)) \u2208 Hds(h) with tds(h)(h, h\u2032) = i; [5] ods(h): \u220f i\u2208N \u03a3ids(h)\u2192 Zds(h); [6] ids(h)=%Pi \u2229 (Zds(h))\u00d7 (Zds(h)).\nEach structure Sds(h) is an extensive game, intuitively, the part of the game that the player moving at h is able to see, where the terminal histories are evaluated according to his criteria.\nThe solution concept proposed in (Grossi and Turrini, 2012) to analyse GSSs is called sightcompatible backwards induction. A sight-compatible backwards induction strategy profile is a choice of strategy, one per player, that is consistent with the subgame perfect equilibrium of each sight-restricted game.\nDefinition 5 (Sight-compatible BI) Let S be a game with short sight. A strategy profile \u03c3 is a sight-compatible backwards induction strategy profile if at each h \u2208 H, there exists a terminal history z \u2208 Zds(h) in the sight-restriction Sds(h) such that h\u03c3(h) z and z \u2208 BI(Sds(h)). The set of sight-compatible backwards induction outcomes of S is denoted SCBI(S) \u2286 Z.\nThus, a sight compatible backwards induction is a strategy profile \u03c3 that, at each history h, recommends an action a that is among the actions initiating a backwards induction history within the sight of the player moving at h. This, notice, is different from the backwards induction solution of the whole game, because players might incorrectly evaluate intermediate game positions - i.e., their P-sequences might not be coherent with the real outcomes of the game. Also, Grossi and Turrini show that the SCBI solution always exists, even in infinite games.\nDespite their effort in modelling more procedural aspects of game play, GSSs still lack non-trivial opponent modelling, i.e., players allowing for their opponents to \u201cmiss\u201d future game developments and evaluate game positions differently (or any higher-order iteration of this belief), while adjusting their behaviour accordingly.\nThe rest of the paper is devoted to expanding GSSs with these more realistic but highly more complex reasoning patterns. This, it turns out, does not prevent us from having appropriate well-behaved solution concepts which generalise classical ones, such as backwards induction."}, {"heading": "3 Rational beliefs and limited foresight", "text": "In this section, we introduce a generalization of GSSs, where players are allowed for the possibility of higher-order opponent-modelling, i.e., to have an explicit belief about what other players can see and how they evaluate it, a belief about what other players believe other players can see and how they evaluate and so forth, compatibly with players\u2019 sight. We study a solution concept for these games and relate it to known ones from the literature."}, {"heading": "3.1 Players\u2019 sights and belief chains", "text": "Let us introduce the idea behind higher-order opponent modelling in GSSs using an example. We will then move on to define the notions formally.\nExample 6 (An intuitive solution) Consider the game shown in Figure 1. Three players, Ann, Bob and Charles, move at histories marked A, B and C, respectively. The circle surrounding history A indicates what Ann believes she can see from history A, which we write b(A). This, intuitively, coincides what Ann can actually see, i.e., it equals s(A), Ann\u2019s sight at history A. What should Ann do in this situation? This depends on what Ann believes will happen next. If Ann knew this, her choice would only be a maximization problem: finding the action that, given what will happen in the future, gets her the maximal outcome, according to how she evaluates the outcomes from A - which we write %AAnn. Next, to find out what Charles will do, Ann considers her belief about what Charles can see from C, which we indicate with b(A)b(C). Note this may have nothing to do with what Charles actually sees from C, i.e., b(C). In Figure 1 Ann believes that Charles can only see d from C. The question what Charles will do is then easily answered, even without considering his preference relation %ACAnn, what Ann believes Charles wants from history C. Charles, according to Ann, will certainly\ngo to d. The next question is: what will Bob do? This, again, will depend on b(A)b(B), the portion of Ann\u2019s sight that Ann believes Bob can see from B and on %ABAnn, the preferences Ann believes Bob has at B. But, at least according to Ann, Bob can also see that Charles can make moves. So, for Bob to decide what to do, he must first find out what Charles will do - b(A)b(B)b(C) - according to %ABCAnn . This is also an easy task, since e is the only option. The choice at b(A)b(B)b(C) is then determined, but so is then the choice at b(A)b(B). Now all that is left for Ann to do is to solve her maximization problem, determining the choice at b(A).\nNow, we concentrate on turning the intuitions in the example into formal definitions. To do so, we introduce the notion of history-sequence. A history-sequence is a formal device that allows to represent higher-order beliefs about other opponents, consistently with a players\u2019 sight.\nDefinition 7 (History-Sequences) Consider a GSS S = ((N,H, t,\u03a3i, o, Pi), s). A historysequence q of S is a sequence of histories of the form (h0, h1, h2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hk) such that\n\u2022 hj \u2208 Hds(h0) for every j \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k}, i.e., histories following h0 in the sequence are histories within the sight of the player moving at h0;\n\u2022 hj hj+1 for each j with 0 \u2264 j < k, i.e., each history is a strict postfix of the ones with lower index;\nThe underlying idea behind this definition is to consider the higher-order point of view of the player moving at h0. Expressions of the form (h0, h1, h2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hk) encode the belief that player moving at h0 holds about the belief that player moving at h1 holds about the belief that player moving at h2 holds . . . about what the player moving at hk can see and\nwhat the evaluation is of the corresponding terminal histories. We use Q to denote the set of history-sequences of S.\nBuilding upon the notion of history-sequence, we can define what we call sight-compatible belief structures, associating each history-sequence with a set of histories and an evaluation over the terminal ones in this set.\nDefinition 8 (Sight-compatible belief structures) Let S be a game with short sight. A sight-compatible belief structure B for S is a tuple (BH ,BP ) such that BH is a function BH : Q \u2192 2H , associating to each history-sequence (h0, h1, h2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hk) a set of histories extending hk, and BP is a function BP : Q \u2192 PH associating to each history-sequence a P-sequence. B satisfies the following conditions:\n\u2022 (Corr) \u2200q \u2208 Q with q = (h0, h1, h2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hk), we have that BH(q) = Hds(h0)|hk whenever t(hk) = t(h0), i.e., the belief of a player about what he himself can see is correct.\n\u2022 (Mon) \u2200 q, q\u2032 \u2208 Q, if \u2203h\u2032 \u2208 BH(q) s.t., q\u2032 = (q, h\u2032), then BH(q\u2032) \u2286 BH(q), i.e., if a player believes someone is able to perceive a portion of the game, then he is able to perceive that portion himself.\nFor q = (h0, h1, h2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hk) the P-sequence BP (q) denotes the higher-order beliefs (in the order given by q) about how player moving at hk is evaluating the terminal histories in BH(q).\nThe conditions (Mon) and (Corr), we argue, are the most natural constraints on sightcompatible higher-order beliefs. For the time being we do not commit ourselves to any other constraints on either BP or BH , but we acknowledge that different contexts may warrant further constraints on both.\nDefinition 9 (Epistemic Games with Short Sight) An Epistemic Game with Short Sight (EGSS) is a tuple S = (S,B) where S is a game with short sight and B a sight-compatible belief structure for S.\nAn EGSS is obtained by assigning a sight-compatible belief structure to a game with short sight. One should observe how sight-compatible belief structures induce, at each history, a whole collection of extensive games, one for each possible history-sequence. For instance, the one resulting from Ann\u2019s sight and her evaluation, the one resulting from Ann\u2019s belief about Bob\u2019s sight and his evaluation and so forth.\nStructures of the form SdB(q) can now be naturally defined, as restrictions induced by B(q) on S, adopting BH(q) as sight-restriction, under the P-sequence given by BP (q). Sight restricted games (Definition 4) become a special case thereof."}, {"heading": "3.2 Analysing EGSSs", "text": "Example 6 has illustrated a natural notion of solution in an epistemic game with short sight, where each player computes a best action in his or her sight restriction according to his or her evaluation criteria, recursively computing both the sight and the evaluation criteria of the other players.

The composition of such outcomes yields our game solution.\nDefinition 11 (Sight-Compatible Epistemic Solution) Let S = (S,B) be an EGSS.

The finiteness assumption ensures termination. 2\nThe following observations illustrate the relation between SCES and the other two relevant solution concepts in the literature: SCBI(Grossi and Turrini, 2012) and classical BI (Osborne and Rubinstein, 1994). They specify precise conditions under which our solution concept collapses into these two.\nAlgorithm 4: Best Branch 1 BB(S,q, Continuations) /* Compose the move (in array Continuations) chosen for\neach decision point, thus get all the paths following hk and choose a best move following hk */ Input: A game S, a history sequence q, an array Continuations Output: A best move following hk determined by Continuations 2 begin 3 bestpath\u2190 VLP; /* VLP is a dominated history for all players */ 4 for each (hk, a) \u2208 BH(q) do /* a is any action following hk, the following lines choose one that leads to a best terminal history in BH(q) */ 5 TP\u2190 (hk, a); 6 while Continuations[TP] is defined in array Continuations do 7 TP\u2190 (TP,Continuations[TP]);\n8 if TP BP (q)t(hk) bestpath then 9 bestpath\u2190 TP;\n10 bestmove\u2190 a;\n11 Return bestmove;\nProposition 14 Let S = (S,B) be an EGSS. If for any history-sequence q = (h0, h1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hk) and any history h\u2032 \u2208 BH(q), BH(q, h\u2032) = BH(q)|h\u2032, and BP (q) = BP (h0), then SCES(S)=SCBI(S).\nSo, if the current player believes the following players\u2019 sights and evaluation criteria, together with their beliefs about other players\u2019 sights and evaluation criteria, are coherent with his\u2019, then SCES is equivalent to SCBI.\nWe know that the solution concept BI is a special case of SCBI, and therefore also of SCES.\nProposition 15 Let S = (S,B) be an epistemic game with short sight. If, for any historysequence q = (h0, h1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hk), we have that BH(q) = H|hk and that BP (q) = Pt(hk) then SCES(S)=BI(S).\nThe above result says that SCES coincides with standard backwards induction solution if, at each history, we have that higher-order beliefs about sight and evaluation criteria are coherent with the real subgame the current player faces and the P-sequence the current player holds.\nDespite the crucial presence of higher-order beliefs about sight-restricted games, we can show the following fairly surprising complexity result.\nProposition 16 Given a finite EGGS S, the problem of computing a SCES of S is P-TIME complete.\nProof sketch: For the upper bound, the key fact is that algorithm Sol(S) runs in time O((n logn)2), with n being the cardinality of the set of histories of S. This follows from the equations and facts below, where b and d are the largest number of branches and the depth\nof game tree respectively: 1). T (sol(S)) = O(T (BSBI \u2217 d)); 2). T (NBS) = O(T (BSBI)); 3). T (BB) = O(b \u2217 d); 4). Let f(d)=T (BSBI), then f(d)=O(b \u2217 f(d\u2212 1) + b2 \u2217 f(d\u2212 2) + b3 \u2217 f(d\u22123) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ bd\u22121f(1) +T (BB))=O(d\u22172d \u2217 bd); 5). d \u2264 log(n) and 2d \u2264 bd \u2264 n. The fact that the problem is P-TIME hard is a consequence of (Szymanik, 2013, Theorem 2), which shows that BI is P-TIME hard, and Proposition 15.\nAs a side remark, using a similar argument and Proposition 15 we are able to show that computing SCBI solutions is P-TIME complete."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "We have proposed a model for decision-making among resource-bounded players in extensive games, integrating an analytical perspective coming game theory with a procedural perspective coming from AI. In particular we have allowed players with limited foresight to reason about their opponents, constructing beliefs about their limited abilities for calculation and evaluation, showing that our novel games have a well-behaved solution, generalising existing ones in the literature.\nThere are interesting modelling issues, as noted at the beginning. Our game models strike a balance between simple trees as used for BI and more complex models as found in epistemic game theory (Perea, 2012). Here, what we left open is the relation between EGSSs and the Extensive Games with Awareness of (Halpern and R\u00eago, 2006). We expect that the correspondence for GSSs of Theorem 3 in (Grossi and Turrini, 2012) can be lifted to EGSSs, using an iteration of the awareness functions Awi for players i to simulate the believed game at a history sequence. We stress, though, that the specific features of EGSSs give them an independent conceptual and technical interest. The emphasis on limited foresight (as opposed to perceiving a novel extensive game in (Halpern and R\u00eago, 2006)) makes them a natural candidate for addressing Rubinstein\u2019s modelling challenge (Rubinstein, 2004), while still supporting a constructive and well-behaved algorithm to calculate the game equilibria.\nFinally, our analysis raises several issues of logical definability and styles of reasoning. We believe that our solution concept is still definable in a computationally well-behaved logical language, a natural candidate being the fixed-point logic FOL(FP), shown in (van Benthem and Gheerbrant, 2010) to express backwards induction. What is new in our setting is that the reasoning underpinning our main theorems is a mixture of a backward induction style with a forward induction style (Perea, 2012; van Benthem, 2014), since we have to evaluate what players further down in the game tree are going to do according to players whose moves occurred earlier on in the game. This makes our framework a good candidate for developing theory based on concrete intuitive scenarios at this still tentative interface of logic and game theory."}], "references": [{"title": "Where do preferences come from", "author": ["Franz Dietrisch", "Christian List"], "venue": "International Journal of Game Theory,", "citeRegEx": "Dietrisch and List.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dietrisch and List.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Games with unawareness", "author": ["Yossi Feinberg"], "venue": "Stanford Graduate School of Busirness Paper No", "citeRegEx": "Feinberg.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Feinberg.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Short sight in extensive games", "author": ["Davide Grossi", "Paolo Turrini"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS", "citeRegEx": "Grossi and Turrini.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Grossi and Turrini.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Extensive games with possibly unaware players", "author": ["Joseph Y.
