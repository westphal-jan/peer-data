It is defined as the process of changing an agent belief with a new acquired knowledge. Three change operations are usually considered: expansion, contraction and revision. We focus here on the revision, i.e. the process of adding consistently the new belief sets. Belief revision has been intensively studied in classical logics (e.g. propositional logic) mostly under the prism of AGM theory [Alchourro\u0301n et al., 1985]. With the growing interest in non-classical logics, such as Horn Logics and Description Logics [Baader, 2003], several attempts to generalize AGM theory, making it compliant to the meta-logical flavor of these logics, have been introduced recently [Flouris et al., 2005; Delgrande and Peppas, 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2013; Ribeiro and Wassermann, 2014].\nIn this paper, we are interested in defining concrete revision operators in Description Logics (DLs). DLs are now pervasive in many knowledge-based representation systems, such as ontological reasoning, semantic web, scene understanding, cognitive robotics, to mention a few. In all these domains, the expert knowledge is rather a flux evolving through time, requiring hence the definition of rational revision operators. Revision is then a cornerstone in ontology engineering life-cycle where the expert knowledge is prone to change and inconsistency. This paper contributes to the effort of defining such rational revision operators, in line with the recent art of the domain [Qi et al., 2006b; Qi et al., 2006a; Flouris et al., 2005; Flouris et al., 2006]. In Section 2 we discuss the adaptation of AGM theory to non-classical logics, including DLs, and introduce, as a first contribution, a model-theoretic rewriting of AGM postulates. In Section 3, we introduce our general framework of relaxation-based revision operators. As a second contribution, we demonstrate that they satisfy the AGM postulates and lead to a faithful assignment. Our third contribution is detailed in Section 4, by providing concrete theory relaxation operators in different DLs (namely ALC and its fragments EL and ELU). Section 5 positions our contributions with regards to the literature and finally Section 6 draws some conclusions and perspectives."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Description Logics", "text": "Description logics are a family of knowledge representation formalisms (see e.g. [Baader, 2003] for more details). We consider, in this paper, the logic ALC and its fragments EL and ELU . In the following we provide the syntax and semantics of ALC, from which those of EL and ELU are easily deducible. Signatures in DLs are triplets (NC , NR, I) where NC , NR and I are nonempty pairwise disjoint sets such that elements in NC , NR and I are concept names, role names and individuals, respectively. Given a signature \u03a3 \u2208 Sign, Sen (\u03a3) contains all the sentences of the form C \u2291 D, x : C and (x, y) : r where x, y \u2208 I , r \u2208 NR and C is an ALCconcept inductively defined from NC and binary and unary operators in { \u2293 , \u2294 } and in { c, \u2200r. , \u2203r. }, respectively. The set of concept descriptions provided by \u03a3 is denoted by C(\u03a3). The semantics of concept descriptions is defined using interpretations. An interpretation I is a pair I = (\u2206I , \u00b7I)\nconsisting of an interpretation domain \u2206I and an interpretation function \u00b7I which maps concepts to subsets of the domain \u2206I and role names to binary relations on the domain. A concept description C is said to subsume a concept description D (denoted by C \u2291 D) if CI \u2286 DI holds for every interpretation I. Two concepts C and D are equivalent (denoted by C \u2261 D) if both C \u2291 D and D \u2291 C hold. An interpretation I is a model of a \u03a3-sentence (TBox or ABox axiom) if it satisfies this sentence (e.g. I |=\u03a3 (C \u2291 D) iff CI \u2286 DI).\nA DL knowledge base T is a set of \u03a3-sentences (i.e. T \u2286 Sen (\u03a3)). An interpretation I is a model of a DL knowledge base T if it satisfies every sentence in T . In the following, we use Mod (\u03d5) (or Mod (T )) to denote the set of all the models of a \u03a3-sentence \u03d5 (or DL knowledge base T ). A knowledge base is said to be a theory if and only if T = Cn(T ), where Cn() is the consequence operator defined as: Cn(T ) = {\u03d5 \u2208 Sen (\u03a3) | \u2200I \u2208 Mod (T ) , I |=\u03a3 \u03d5} and satisfying monotonicity, inclusion and idempotence. Hence DLs can be considered as Tarskian logics, i.e. pairs \u3008\u03a3,Cn()\u3009.\nClassically, consistency of a theory T in DLs is defined as Mod (T ) 6= \u2205. Such a definition raised several issues in adapting revision postulates to Description Logics (see [Ribeiro et al., 2013; Ribeiro and Wassermann, 2014]). We consider in this paper a more general definition of consistency the meaning of which is that there is at least a sentence which is not a semantic consequence: T \u2286 Sen (\u03a3) is consistent if Cn(T ) 6= Sen (\u03a3)."}, {"heading": "2.2 AGM theory and Description Logics", "text": "AGM theory [Alchourro\u0301n et al., 1985] is probably the most influential paradigm in belief revision theory [Ga\u0308rdenfors, 2003]. It provides, at an abstract logical level, a set of postulates that a revision operator should satisfy so that the old belief is changed minimally and rationally to become consistent with the new one. These postulates require the logic to be closed under negation and usual propositional connectives (\u2228,\u2227, =\u21d2 ,\u00ac) which prevents its use in many non-classical logics, including DLs. Indeed, many DLs do not allow for negation of concepts (e.g. EL) and a fortiori disjunction between TBox and ABox sentences is not defined in all DLs. Recently, many papers have addressed the adaptation of AGM theory to non-classical logics, e.g. [Flouris et al., 2005; Ribeiro et al., 2013; Delgrande and Peppas, 2015; Ribeiro and Wassermann, 2014]. The first efforts concentrated on the adaptation of contraction postulates, but more recently, [Ribeiro and Wassermann, 2014] discussed the adaptation of revision postulates and introduced new minimality criteria, not necessarily related to the contraction operator, throwing out the need for negation. However, one can find in [Qi et al., 2006b] an attempt to adapt the AGM revision postulates to DL in a model-theoretic way, following the seminal work of [Katsuno and Mendelzon, 1991] that translated the AGM postulates in propositional logic semantics. The translation in [Qi et al., 2006b] is provided with the classical notion of consistency (a theory T is consistent if Mod (T ) 6= 0) which is not adequate to revision purposes (see [Flouris et al., 2006] for a discussion). In this paper we consider a model-theoretic translation of AGM postulates,\nsimilar to the ones in [Qi et al., 2006b], with the notable difference that consistency is defined through the consequence operator as introduced in the previous section. This translation is in accordance with the postulates as introduced in [Ribeiro and Wassermann, 2014].\nGiven two knowledge bases T, T \u2032 \u2286 Sen (\u03a3), T \u25e6 T \u2032 denotes the revision of the old belief T by the new one T \u2032. The model-theoretic translation of AGM postulates writes:\n(G1) Mod (T \u25e6 T \u2032) \u2286 Mod (T \u2032).\n(G2) If T \u222a T \u2032 is consistent, then T \u25e6 T \u2032 = T \u222a T \u2032.\n(G3) If T \u2032 is consistent, then so is T \u25e6 T \u2032.\n(G4) If Mod (T1) = Mod (T \u20321) and Mod (T2) = Mod (T \u2032 2),\nthen Mod (T1 \u25e6 T2) = Mod (T \u20321 \u25e6 T \u2032 2).\n(G5) Mod (T \u25e6 T \u2032) \u2229Mod (T \u2032\u2032) \u2286 Mod (T \u25e6 (T \u2032 \u222a T \u2032\u2032)).\n(G6) If T \u222a T \u2032 \u222a T \u2032\u2032 is consistent, then T \u25e6 (T \u2032 \u222a T \u2032\u2032) = (T \u25e6 T \u2032) \u222a T \u2032\u2032.\nBesides these postulates, we consider a minimality criterion introduced in [Ribeiro and Wassermann, 2014]: (Relevance) If \u03d5 \u2208 T \\ (T \u25e6 T \u2032), then there exists X , T \u2229 (T \u25e6 T \u2032) \u2286 X \u2286 T , such that Cn(X \u222a T \u2032) 6= Sen (\u03a3) and Cn(X \u222a {\u03d5} \u222a T \u2032) = Sen (\u03a3).\nA classical construction in belief theory is to characterize the revision operator in terms of faithful assignments [Katsuno and Mendelzon, 1991; Grove, 1988]. We provide here a similar representation theorem for the postulates defined above. The proof can be found in [Aiguier et al., 2015].\nDefinition 1 (Faithful assignment) Let T \u2286 Sen (\u03a3) be a knowledge base. Let T\u2286 Mod (\u03a3) \u00d7 Mod (\u03a3) be a total pre-order.

In this paper we generalize this notion to formula relaxation and subsequently to theory relaxation in order to define revision operators.\nDefinition 2 (Concept Relaxation [Distel et al., 2014c]) A (concept) relaxation is an operator \u03c1 : C(\u03a3) \u2192 C(\u03a3) that satisfies the following two properties1 for all C \u2208 C(\u03a3).\n1. \u03c1 is extensive, i.e. C \u2291 \u03c1(C),\n2. \u03c1 is exhaustive, i.e. \u2203k \u2208 N0 : \u22a4 \u2291 \u03c1k(C),\nwhere \u03c1k denotes \u03c1 applied k times, and \u03c10 is the identity mapping.\nOur idea to define revision operators is to relax the set of models of the old belief until it becomes consistent with the new pieces of knowledge. This is illustrated in Figure 1 where theories are represented as sets of their models. Intermediate steps to define the revision operators are then the definition of formula and theory relaxations. The whole scheme of our framework is provided in Figure 2.\nDefinition 3 (Formula Relaxation) Given a signature \u03a3 \u2208 Sign, a \u03a3-formula relaxation is a mapping \u03c1\u03a3 : Sen (\u03a3) \u2192 Sen (\u03a3) satisfying the following properties:\n\u2022 Extensivity: \u2200\u03d5 \u2208 Sen (\u03a3) ,Mod (\u03d5) \u2286 Mod (\u03c1\u03a3(\u03d5)).\n\u2022 Exhaustivity: \u2203k \u2208 N,Mod ( \u03c1k\u03a3(\u03d5) )\n= Mod (\u03a3), where \u03c1kdenotes \u03c1\u03a3 applied k times, and \u03c10\u03a3 is the identity mapping.\nDefinition 4 (\u03a3-theory relaxation) Let T be a theory, T \u2208 P(Sen (\u03a3)), \u03c1\u03a3 a \u03a3-formula relaxation and a set K = {k\u03d5 \u2208 N | \u03d5 \u2208 T }.

The set K may not be unique either.\nTheorem 2 From any \u03a3-theory relaxation \u03c1K and every knowledge base T \u2286 Sen (\u03a3), the binary relation T\u2286 Mod (\u03a3)\u00d7Mod (\u03a3) defined by I T I \u2032 if:\nmin K|I\u2208Mod(\u03c1K(T ))\n\u2211\nk\u2208K\nk \u2264 min K\u2032|I\u2032\u2208Mod(\u03c1K\u2032(T ))\n\u2211\nk\u2208K\u2032\nk\nis a well-founded faithful assignment such that for every T \u2032 \u2286 Sen (\u03a3), Mod (T \u25e6 T \u2032) = min(Mod (T \u2032) \\M\u2217, T ).\nProof: By construction, T is obviously a total pre-order. Well-foundness follows from exhaustivity. The two first conditions follow from the fact that I \u2208 Mod (T ) \u21d0\u21d2 minK|I\u2208Mod(\u03c1K(T )) \u2211\nk\u2208K k = 0. The third one is obvious. It remains to show that Mod (T \u25e6 T \u2032) = min(Mod (T \u2032) \\ M\u2217, T ). To simplify the proof, we suppose that T \u25e6 T \u2032 = \u03c1K(T ) \u222a T \u2032 (i.e. if T = T1 \u2210\nT2, then T2 = \u2205), the more general case where T2 6= \u2205 being easily obtained from this more simple case.\n(i) Let I \u2208 Mod (T \u25e6 T \u2032). By definition of \u25e6, there exists a set K \u2282 N such that I \u2208 Mod ( \u03c1K(T ) \u222a T \u2032 )\n, and then I \u2208 Mod (T \u2032). Let I \u2032 \u2208 Mod (T \u2032). If I \u2032 \u2208 Mod ( \u03c1K(T ) )\n, then I6 TI \u2032 and I \u2032 6 TI. Otherwise I \u2032 6\u2208 Mod ( \u03c1K(T ) ) and \u2200K\u2032 such that I \u2032 \u2208 Mod ( \u03c1K \u2032 (T ) ) we have \u2211\nk\u2208K\u2032 k \u2265 \u2211\nk\u2208K k. Then minK\u2032|I\u2032\u2208Mod(\u03c1K\u2032 (T )) \u2211 k\u2208K\u2032 \u2265 \u2211 k\u2208K k, which implies I T I \u2032. We can hence conclude that I \u2208 min(Mod (T \u2032) \\M\u2217, T ).\n(ii) Conversely, let I \u2208 min(Mod (T \u2032) \\ M\u2217, T ). By definition of \u25e6, there exists a set K of minimal sum such that \u03c1K(T ) \u222a T \u2032 is consistent and T \u25e6 T \u2032 = \u03c1K(T ) \u222a T \u2032. As I \u2208 min(Mod (T \u2032) \\ M\u2217, T ), this means that, for every I \u2032 \u2208 Mod ( \u03c1K(T ) \u222a T \u2032 )\n, I T I \u2032, and then I \u2208 Mod ( \u03c1K(T ) \u222a T \u2032 ) = I \u2208 Mod (T \u25e6 T \u2032).\nProposition 2 The revision in Definition 5 satisfies the Relevance minimality criterion.\nThe proof is direct by setting X = T \u2032\u20321 ."}, {"heading": "4 Concrete theory relaxations in different", "text": "ALC fragments\nIn this section, we introduce concrete relaxation operators suited to the syntax of the logic ALC , as defined in Section 2.1, and its fragments EL and ELU . EL-concept description constructors are existential restriction (\u2203), conjunction (\u2293), \u22a4 and \u22a5, while ELU -concept constructors are those of EL enriched with disjunction (\u2294).\nFormulas in DL are of the GCI form: C \u2291 D, where C and D are any two complex concepts, or Abox assertions: (a : C, \u3008a, b\u3009 : r), with r a role. We propose to define a \u03a3-formula relaxation in two ways (other definitions may also\nexist). For GCIs, a first approach consists in relaxing the set of models of D while another one amounts to \u201cretract\u201d the set of models of C.

A trivial concept retraction is the operator \u03ba\u22a5 that maps every concept to \u22a5. This operator is particularly interesting for debugging ontologies expressed in EL [Schlobach et al., 2007]. Let us illustrate this operator through the following example adapted from [Qi et al., 2006b] to restrict the language to EL. Example 1 Let T = {TWEETY \u2291 BIRD, BIRD \u2291 FLIES} and T \u2032 = {TWEETY \u2293 FLIES \u2291 \u22a5}. Clearly T \u222a T \u2032 is inconsistent. The retraction-based \u03a3-formula relaxation amounts to apply \u03ba\u22a5 to the concept TWEETY resulting in the following new knowledge base {\u22a5 \u2291 BIRD, BIRD \u2291 FLIES} which is now consistent with T \u2032. An alternative solution is to retract the concept BIRD in BIRD \u2291 FLIES which results in the following knowledge base {TWEETY \u2291 BIRD,\u22a5 \u2291 FLIES} which is also consistent with T \u2032.

A good final solution could be T \u25e6 T \u2032 = {\u22a5 \u2291 BIRD, BIRD \u2291 FLIES, TWEETY \u2293 FLIES \u2291 \u22a5} based on an additional preference relation among the solutions defined from the minimality of the \u201csize\u201d of the modified concepts.\nEL-Concept Relaxations. A trivial relaxation is the operator \u03c1\u22a4 that maps every concept to \u22a4. Other non-trivial EL-concept description relaxations have been introduced in [Distel et al., 2014b]. We summarize here some of these operators. EL concept descriptions can appropriately be represented as labeled trees, often called EL description trees [Baader et al., 1999]. An EL description tree is a tree whose nodes are labeled with sets of concept names and whose edges are labeled with role names. An EL concept description\nC \u2261 P1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 Pn \u2293 \u2203r1.C1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 \u2203rm.Cm (1)\nwith Pi \u2208 NC \u222a{\u22a4}, can be translated into a description tree by labeling the root node v0 with {P1, . . . , Pn}, creating an rj successor, and then proceeding inductively by expanding Cj for the rj-successor node for all j \u2208 {1, . . . ,m}.\nAn EL-concept description relaxation then amounts to apply simple tree operations. Two relaxations can hence be defined [Distel et al., 2014b]: (i) \u03c1depth that reduces the role depth of each concept by 1, simply by pruning the description tree, and (ii) \u03c1leaves that removes all leaves from a description tree.\n4.2 Relaxations in ELU The relaxation defined above exploits the strong property that an EL concept description is isomorphic to a description tree. This is arguably not true for more expressive DLs. Let us try to go a one step further in expressivity and consider the logic ELU . A relaxation operator as introduced in [Distel et al., 2014b] requires a concept description to be in a special normal form, called normal form with grouping of existentials, defined recursively as follows.\nDefinition 9 We say that an EL-concept D is written in normal form with grouping of existential restrictions if it is of the form\nD = l\nA\u2208ND\nA \u2293 l\nr\u2208NR\nDr, (2)\nwhere ND \u2286 NC is a set of concept names and the concepts Dr are of the form\nDr = l\nE\u2208CDr\n\u2203r.E, (3)\nwhere no subsumption relation holds between two distinct conjuncts and CDr is a set of complex EL-concepts that are themselves in normal form with grouping of existential restrictions.\nThe purpose of Dr terms is simply to group existential restrictions that share the same role name. For an ELU - concept C we say that C is in normal form if it is of the form (C \u2261 C1\u2294C2\u2294\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2294Ck) and each of the Ci is an EL-concept in normal form with grouping of existential restrictions.\nDefinition 10 [Distel et al., 2014b] Given an ELU -concept description C we define an operator \u03c1e recursively as follows. For C = A \u2208 NC and for C = \u22a4 we define \u03c1e(A) = \u03c1e(\u22a4) = \u22a4. For C = Dr, where Dr is a group of existential restrictions as in (3), we need to distinguish two cases:\n\u2022 if Dr \u2261 \u2203r.\u22a4 we define \u03c1e(Dr) = \u22a4, and\n\u2022 if Dr 6\u2261 \u2203r.\u22a4 then we define \u03c1e(Dr) = \u2294\nS\u2286CDr\n(d E/\u2208S \u2203r.E \u2293 \u2203r.\u03c1e (d F\u2208S F )) .\nNotice that in the latter case \u22a4 /\u2208 CDr since Dr is in normal form. For C = D as in (2) we define \u03c1e(D) = \u2294\nG\u2208CD\n( \u03c1e(G) \u2293 d\nH\u2208CD\\G H\n)\n, where CD = ND \u222a {Dr |\nr \u2208 NR}. Finally for C = C1 \u2294 C2 \u2294 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2294 Ck we set \u03c1e(C) = \u03c1e(C1) \u2294 \u03c1e(C2) \u2294 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2294 \u03c1e(Ck).\nThe proof of \u03c1e being a relaxation, i.e. satisfying exhaustivity and extensivity is detailed in [Distel et al., 2014a].\nLet us illustrate this operator on an example.\nExample 2 Suppose an agent believes that a person BOB is married to a female judge: T = {BOB \u2291 MALE \u2293 \u2203.MARRIEDTO. (FEMALE \u2293 JUDGE)}. Suppose now that due to some obscurantist law, it happens that females are not allowed to be judges. This new belief is captured as T \u2032 = {JUDGE \u2293 FEMALE \u2291 \u22a5}. By applying \u03c1e one can resolve the conflict between the two belief sets. To ease the reading, let us rewrite the concepts as follows: A \u2261 MALE, B \u2261 FEMALE, C \u2261 JUDGE,m \u2261 MARRIEDTO, D \u2261 \u2203MARRIEDTO. (FEMALE \u2293 JUDGE). Hence \u03c1e(A \u2293D) \u2261 (\u03c1e(A) \u2293D) \u2294 (A \u2293 \u03c1e(D)), with \u03c1e(A) \u2261 \u22a4 and\n\u03c1e(D) \u2261\u2203m.\u03c1e(B \u2293 C) \u2294 (\u2203m.B \u2293 \u2203m.\u03c1e(C))\u2294\n(\u2203m.\u03c1e(B) \u2293 \u2203m.C)\n\u2261\u2203m.(B \u2294 C) \u2294 (\u2203m.B \u2293 \u2203m.\u22a4) \u2294 (\u2203m.\u22a4\u2293 \u2203m.C)\n\u2261\u2203m.B \u2294 \u2203m.C \u2294 \u2203m.(B \u2294 C) \u2261 \u2203m.B \u2294 \u2203m.C\nThen\n\u03c1e(A \u2293D) \u2261 (\u03c1e(A) \u2293D) \u2294 (A \u2293 \u03c1e(D))\n\u2261(\u22a4 \u2293D) \u2294 (A \u2293 (\u2203m.B \u2294 \u2203m.C))\n\u2261D \u2294 (A \u2293 (\u2203m.B \u2294 \u2203m.C))\nThe new agent\u2019s belief, up to a rewriting, becomes {BOB \u2291 \u2203.MARRIEDTO. (FEMALE \u2293 JUDGE) \u2294 (MALE \u2293 (\u2203MARRIED.FEMALE \u2294 \u2203MARRIED.JUDGE)) , JUDGE \u2293 FEMALE \u2291 \u22a5}.\nAnother possibility for defining a relaxation in ELU is obtained by exploiting the disjunction constructor by augmenting a concept description with a set of exceptions.\nDefinition 11 Given an exception set E = {E1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , En}, we define a relaxation of degree k of an ELU -concept description C as follows: for a finite set Ek \u2286 E with |Ek| = k\n\u03c1kE(C) = C\u2294Ei1 \u2294\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2294Eik , \u2200ij , Eij \u2208 E k and Eij \u2293C \u2291 \u22a5\nExtensivity of this operator follows directly from the definition. However, exhaustivity is not necessarily satisfied unless\nthe exception set includes the \u22a4 concept or the disjunction of some or all of its elements entails the \u22a4 concept.\nIf we consider again Example 1, a relaxation of the formula BIRD \u2291 FLIES using the operator \u03c1kE over the concept FLIES with the exception set E = {TWEETY} results in the formula BIRD \u2291 FLIES \u2294 TWEETY. The new revised knowledge base is then {TWEETY \u2291 BIRD, BIRD \u2291 FLIES\u2294TWEETY, TWEETY\u2293 FLIES \u2291 \u22a5} which is consistent.\nAnother example involving this relaxation will be discussed in the ALC case (cf. Example 3).\n4.3 Relaxation and retraction in ALC We consider here operators suited to ALC language. Of course, all the operators defined for EL and ELU remain valid.\nALC-Concept Retractions. A first possibility for defining retraction is to remove iteratively from an ALC-concept description one or a set of its subconcepts. A similar construction has been introduced in [Qi et al., 2006b] by transforming Abox assertions to nominals and conjuncting their negations from the concept they belong to. Interestingly enough, almost all the operators defined in [Qi et al., 2006b; Gorogiannis and Hunter, 2008] are relaxations.\nDefinition 12 Let C be any ALC-concept description, we define \u03banE(C) = C \u2293 E c 1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 E c n s.t. E1 \u2291 C, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , En \u2291 C.\nConsider again Example 1. \u03ba1E(BIRD) = BIRD \u2293 TWEETY c. The resulting revised knowledge base is then {TWEETY \u2291 BIRD, BIRD\u2293 TWEETYc \u2291 FLIES, TWEETY \u2293 FLIES \u2291 \u22a5} which is consistent.\nAnother possibility, suggested in [Gorogiannis and Hunter, 2008] and related to operators defined in propositional logic as introduced in [Bloch and Lang, 2002], consists in applying the retraction at the atomic level. This captures somehow the Dalal\u2019s idea of revision operators in propositional logic [Dalal, 1988].\nDefinition 13 Let C be an ALC-concept description of the form Q1r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Qmrm.D, where Qi is a quantifier and D is quantifier-free and in CNF form, i.e. D = E1 \u2293 E2 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7En with Ei being disjunctions of possibly negated atomic concepts. Define, as in the propositional case [Bloch and Lang, 2002], \u03bap(D) = dn j=1( \u2294\ni6=j Ei). Then \u03banDalal(C) = Q1r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Qnrn.\u03ba n p (D).\nThis idea can be generalized to consider any retraction defined in ELU .\nDefinition 14 Let C be an ALC-concept description of the form Q1r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Qmrm.D, where Qi is a quantifier and D is a quantifier-free. Then \u03ban\u2229(C) = Q1r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Qmrm.\u03ba n E(D).\nAnother possible ALC-concept description retraction is obtained by substituting the existential restriction by an universal one. This idea has been sketched in [Gorogiannis and Hunter, 2008] for defining dilation operators (then by transforming \u2200 into \u2203), i.e. special relaxation operators enjoying additional properties [Distel et al., 2014b; Distel et al., 2014b]. We adapt it here to define retraction in DL syntax.\nDefinition 15 Let C be an ALC-concept description of the form Q1r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Qnrn.D, where Qi is a quantifier and D is quantifier-free, then\n\u03baq(C) = l {Q\u20321r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Q \u2032 nrn.D | \u2203j \u2264 n s.t. Qj = \u2203\nand Q\u2032j = \u2200, and for all i \u2264 n s.t. i 6= j,Q \u2032 i = Qi}\nALC-Concept Relaxations. Let us now introduce some relaxation operators suited to ALC language.\nDefinition 16 Let C be an ALC-concept description of the form Q1r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Qmrm.D, where Qi is a quantifier and D is quantifier-free and in DNF form, i.e. D = E1 \u2294 E2 \u2294 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7En with Ei being conjunction of possibly negated atomic concepts. Define, as in the propositional case [Bloch and Lang, 2002], \u03c1p(D) = \u2294n j=1( d i6=j Ei), then \u03c1nDalal(C) = Q1r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Qmrm.\u03c1 n p (D).\nAs for retraction, this idea can be generalized to consider any relaxation defined in ELU .\nDefinition 17 Let C be an ALC-concept description of the form Q1r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Qnrn.D, where Qi is a quantifier and D is quantifier-free, then \u03c1n\u222a(C) = Q1r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Qnrn.\u03c1 n E(D).\nLet us consider another example adapted from the literature to illustrate these operators [Qi et al., 2006b].\nExample 3 Let us consider the following knowledge bases: T = {BOB \u2291 \u2200HASCHILD.RICH, BOB \u2291 \u2203HASCHILD.MARY, MARY \u2291 RICH} and T \u2032 = {BOB \u2291 HASCHILD.JOHN, JOHN \u2291 RICHc}. Relaxing the formula BOB \u2291 \u2200HASCHILD.RICH by applying \u03c1n\u222a to the concept on the right hand side results in the following formula BOB \u2291 \u2200HASCHILD.(RICH \u2294 JOHN) which resolves the conflict between the two knowledge bases.\nA last possibility, dual to the retraction operator given in Definition 15, consists in transforming universal quantifiers to existential ones.\nDefinition 18 Let C be an ALC-concept description of the form Q1r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Qnrn.D, where Qi is a quantifier and D is quantifier-free, then\n\u03c1q(C) = \u2294 {Q\u20321r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Q \u2032 nrn.D | \u2203j \u2264 n s.t. Qj = \u2200\nand Q\u2032j = \u2203, and for all i \u2264 n s.t. i 6= j,Q \u2032 i = Qi}\nIf we consider again Example 3, relaxing the formula BOB \u2291 \u2200HASCHILD.RICH by applying \u03c1q to the concept on the right hand\nside results in the following formula BOB \u2291 \u2203HASCHILD.RICH, which resolves the conflict between the two knowledge bases.\nThe following proposition summarizes the properties of the introduced operators.\nProposition 5 The operators \u03c1\u22a4, \u03c1depth, \u03c1leaves, \u03c1e, \u03c1Dalal, \u03c1q are extensive and exhaustive. The operators \u03c1E , \u03c1\u222a are extensive but not exhaustive. The operators \u03ba\u22a5, \u03baE , \u03baDalal, \u03ba\u2229 are anti-extensive and exhaustive. The operators \u03baq is antiextensive but not exhaustive.\nThese properties are directly derived from the definitions and from properties of \u03c1p and \u03bap detailed in [Bloch and Lang, 2002]. Note that for \u03baq exhaustivity can be obtained by further removing recursively the remaining universal quantifiers and apply at the final step any retraction defined above on the concept D."}, {"heading": "5 Related works", "text": "In the last decade, several works have studied revision operators in Description Logics. While most of them concentrated on the adaptation of AGM theory, few works have concerned the definition of concrete operators [Meyer et al., 2005; Qi et al., 2006a; Qi et al., 2006b]. A closely related field is inconsistency handling in ontologies (e.g. [Schlobach and Cornet, 2003; Schlobach et al., 2007]), with the main difference that the rationality of inconsistency repairing operators is not investigated, as suggested by AGM theory.\nSome of our relaxation operators are closely related to the ones introduced in [Qi et al., 2006b] for knowledge bases revision and in [Gorogiannis and Hunter, 2008] for merging first-order theories. Our relaxation-based revision framework, being abstract enough (i.e. defined through easily satisfied properties), encompasses these operators. Moreover, the revision operator defined in [Qi et al., 2006b] considers only inconsistencies due to Abox assertions. Our operators are general in the sense that Abox assertions are handled as any formula of the language.\nThe relaxation idea originates from the work on MorphoLogics, initially introduced in [Bloch and Lang, 2002; Bloch et al., 2004]. In this seminal work, revision operators (and explanatory relations) were defined through dilation and erosion operators. These operators share some similarities with relaxation and retraction as defined in this paper. Dilation is a sup-preserving operator and erosion is inf-preserving, hence both are increasing. Some particular dilations and erosions are exhaustive and extensive while relaxation and retraction operators are defined to be exhaustive and extensive but not necessarily sup- and inf-preserving.\nAnother contribution in this paper concerns the generalization of AGM postulates and their translation in a modeltheoretic writing with a definition of inconsistency, allowing using them in a wide class of non-classical logics. This follows recent works on the adaptation of AGM theory (e.g. [Ribeiro et al., 2013; Ribeiro and Wassermann, 2014; Delgrande and Peppas, 2015; Flouris et al., 2005]). Our generalization is closely related to the one recently introduced in [Ribeiro and Wassermann, 2014] and could be seen as its\ncounterpart in a model-theoretic setting. It also extends the one introduced in [Qi et al., 2006b]."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we provided a generalization of AGM postulates so as they become applicable to a wide class of non-classical logics. Secondly we proposed a general framework for defining revision operators based on the notion of relaxation. We demonstrated that such a relaxation-based framework for belief revision satisfies the AGM postulates and leads to a faithful assignment. Thirdly, we introduced a bunch of concrete relaxations, discussed their properties and illustrated them through simple examples. Future work will concern the study of the complexity of these operators, the comparison of their induced ordering, and their generalization to other non-classical logics such as Horn logic.\nAcknowledgments.

Belief revision is one of them, of prime importance when knowledge is prone to change and inconsistency. In this paper we address both the generalization of the well-known AGM postulates, and the definition of concrete and well-founded revision operators in different DL families. We introduce a modeltheoretic version of the AGM postulates with a general definition of inconsistency, hence enlarging their scope to a wide family of non-classical logics, in particular negation-free DL families. We propose a general framework for defining revision operators based on the notion of relaxation, introduced recently for defining dissimilarity measures between DL concepts. A revision operator in this framework amounts to relax the set of models of the old belief until it reaches the sets of models of the new piece of knowledge. We demonstrate that such a relaxation-based revision operator defines a faithful assignment and satisfies the generalized AGM postulates. Another important contribution concerns the definition of several concrete relaxation operators suited to the syntax of some DLs (ALC and its fragments EL and ELU).", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
