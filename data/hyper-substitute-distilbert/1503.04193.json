Extensions of intuitionistic linear logic with modalities have been investigated for example in (D\u2019Agostino et al., 1997; Kamide, 2006; Marion and Sadrzadeh, 2004). Moreover, modal versions of logics for resources that are related to Linear Logic have been provided in (Courtault and Galmiche, 2013; Pym and Tofts, 2006; Pym et al., 2004).\nModalities in substructural logics are thus not new, although with one important detail: to our knowledge, modalities in sub-structural logics have always\n\u2217This article greatly extends an earlier paper which appeared in the proceedings of the 21st European Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ECAI 2014, (Porello and Troquard, 2014).\n\u2020Laboratory for Applied Ontology, ISTC-CNR, Trento, Italy. daniele.porello@loa.istc.cnr.it\n\u2021Algorithmic, Complexity and Logic Laboratory, Universite\u0301 Paris-Est, Cre\u0301teil, France. troquard@loa.istc.cnr.it\nbeen restricted to normal modalities. Modalities that are not normal have been confined to the realm of classical logic.\nNormal modalities are the modalities within a logic that is at least as strong as the standard modal logic K. Non-normal modalities on the other hand are the modalities within a logic strictly weaker than the standard modal logic K. They cannot be evaluated over a Kripke semantics but one typical semantics, neighbourhood models, rely on possible worlds. They were introduced independently by Scott and Montague. Early results were offered by Segerberg. Chellas built upon and gave a textbook presentation in (Chellas, 1980).\nThe significance of non-normal modal logics and their semantics in modern developments in logics of agents has been emphasised before (Arlo\u0301-Costa and Pacuit, 2006). Indeed many logics of agents are non-normal and neighbourhood semantics allows for defining the modalities that are required to model a number of application domains: logics of coalitional power (Pauly, 2002), epistemic logics without omniscience (Lismont and Mongin, 1994; Vardi, 1986), logics of agency (Governatori and Rotolo, 2005), etc.\nLet us briefly present some features of reasoning about agency specifically. Modalities of agency aimed at modelling the result of an action have been largely studied in the literature in practical philosophy and in multi-agent systems (Belnap et al., 2001; Governatori and Rotolo, 2005; Kanger and Kanger, 1966; Po\u0308rn, 1977; Troquard, 2014). Logics of agency assume a set of agents, and to each agent i associate a modality Ei. We read Ei\u03d5 as \u201cagent i brings about \u03d5\u201d. With the notable exception of Chellas\u2019 logic (Chellas, 1969), it is generally accepted in logics of agency that no agent ever brings about a tautology. This is because when i brings about \u03d5, it is intended that \u03d5 might have not be the case if it were not for i\u2019s very agency. Classically, it corresponds to the axiom \u00acEi\u22a4. This principle is enough for the logic of the modality Ei to be non-normal as it is inconsistent with the necessitation rule. A normal modal logic for agency would also dictate that if i does \u03d5 then she also does \u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8. This is refuted in general on the same grounds as Ross\u2019 paradox. For instance, purposefully doing that I am rich should not imply purposefully doing that I am rich or unhealthy.\nIn classical logic, Ei\u03d5 allows one to capture that agent i brings about the state of affairs \u03d5. Moving from states of affairs to resources, it is then interesting to lift these modalities from classical logic to resource-conscious logic. In doing so, one can capture with EiA that agent i brings about the resource A.\nTo make a start with this research program, we will combine intuitionistic fragments of Linear Logic with non-normal modalities. Linear Logic (Girard, 1987) is a resource-conscious logic that allows for modelling the constructive content of deductions in logic. An intuitionistic version of Linear Logic, as the one we will work with, has a number of desirable features. One that is simple and yet greatly appreciable is that as we shall see, in intuitionistic sequent calculus every sequent has a single \u201coutput\u201d formula. This feature favours the modelling of input-output processes. It will prove particularly adequate for our application to agency and artefacts as it provides a simple mechanism for the compositionality of individual artefacts\u2019 functions into complex input-output\nprocesses.\nThe resource-sensitive nature of Linear Logic can be viewed as the absence of structural rules in the sequent calculus. Linear Logic rejects the global validity of weakening (W), that amounts to a monotonicity of the entailment, and contraction (C), that is responsible for arbitrary duplications of formulas, e.g., A\u2192 A \u2227 A is a tautology in classical logic, and so is A \u2227 A\u2192 A.\n\u0393 \u22a2 A (W) \u0393, B \u22a2 A\n\u0393, B,B \u22a2 A (C)\n\u0393, B \u22a2 A\n\u0393, A,B \u22a2 C (E) \u0393, B,A \u22a2 C\nAccordingly, the linear implication \u22b8 encodes resource-sensitive deductions, for example from A and A \u22b8 B we can infer B, by modus ponens, but we are not allowed to conclude B from A, A, and A \u22b8 B. Exchange (E) still holds. (Although we will later restrict it.) Hence, contexts of formulas \u0393 in sequent calculus are considered multisets. By dropping weakening and contraction, we are led to define two non-equivalent conjunctions with different behaviours: the multiplicative conjunction \u2297 (tensor) and the additive conjunction & (with). The intuitive meaning of \u2297 is that an action of type A\u2297B can be performed by summing the resources that are relevant to perform A and to perform B. The unit 1 is the neutral element for \u2297 and can represent model a null action. A consequence of the lack of weakening is that A\u2297B no longer implies A, namely the resources that are relevant to perform A\u2297B may not be relevant to perform just A. The absence of contraction means that A \u22b8 A \u2297 A is no longer valid. The additive conjunction A & B expresses an option, the choice to perform A or B. Accordingly A&B \u22b8 A holds in Linear Logic, the resources that enable the choice between A and B are relevant also to make A or to make B. The linear implication A\u22b8 B expresses a form of causality, for example \u201cIf I strike a match, I can light the room\u201d the action of striking a match is consumed, in the sense that it is no longer available after the room is lighted. Linear implication and multiplicative conjunction interact naturally so that (A \u2297 (A \u22b8 B)) \u22b8 B is valid.\nLinear logic operators have been applied to a number of topics in knowledge representation and multiagent systems such as planning (Kanovich and Vauzeilles, 2001), preference representation and resource allocation (Harland and Winikoff, 2002; Porello and Endriss, 2010), social choice (Porello, 2013), and actions modelling (Borgo et al., 2014).\nThese propositional operators are very useful when talking about resources and agency. They allow one to capture the following notions:\n\u2022 Bringing about both A and B together: Ei(A \u2297 B). In such a way that Ei(A\u2297B) implies A\u2297B, but does not imply A alone.\n\u2022 Bringing about an option between A and B: Ei(A & B). In such a way that Ei(A&B) implies A and implies B, but does not imply A\u2297B.\n\u2022 Bringing about the transformation of the resource A into the resource B: Ei(A\u22b8 B). In such as way that A\u2297 Ei(A\u22b8 B) implies B.\nThe only structural rule that holds in Linear Logic is exchange (E), that is responsible for the commutativity of the logical operators and amounts to forgetting sequentiality of information, e.g., A\u2227B \u2192 B \u2227A. We will see in this paper how to deal with ordered information. We will still admit exchange for the two conjunctions & and \u2297 (commutative conjunctions), but we will introduce a non-commutative counterpart \u2299 to the multiplicative \u2297. The formula A\u2299B is not equivalent to B \u2299 A. Since \u2299 is non-commutative, we can have two order-sensitive linear implication (noted in (Lambek, 1958) \\ and /).\nFor agency in multi-agent systems, resources must often become available at key points in a series of transformations. The order of resource production and transformation becomes quickly relevant. It is then interesting to talk about:\n\u2022 Bringing about the resource A first, then B: Ei(A \u2299 B). In such a way that Ei(A\u2299B) is not equivalent to Ei(B \u2299A).\n\u2022 Bringing about the order-sensitive transformation of the resource from A into B: Ei(A \\ B). In such a way that A \u2299 Ei(A \\ B) implies B, but Ei(A \\B)\u2299A does not.\nThese considerations motivate us to investigate the theoretical underpinnings of modal versions of resource-conscious logics with the listed propositional operators.\nWe will first concentrate on extensions with one minimal non-normal modality. In a second part, where we address modalities of agency, we will exploit our results that will naturally scale up to logics with multiple non-minimal (but still non-normal) modalities.\nOutline. In Section 2, we present the Kripke resource models which already exist in the literature. The semantics of all the languages studied in this paper will be adequate extensions of Kripke resource models. We first enrich the Kripke resource models with neighbourhood functions to capture non-normal modalities. We obtain what we simply coin modal Kripke resource models. We define and study a minimal non-normal modal logic, MILL. We introduce a Hilbert system in Section 3 and a sequent calculus in Section 4; Both are shown sound and complete. Moreover, we show that the sequent calculus allows cut elimination that provides a normal form for proofs. Proof search is proved to be in PSPACE.\nWe extend our framework in Section 5 to account for partially commutative Linear Logic that allows for integrating commutative and non-commutative operators.\nThen in Section 6 we instantiate the minimal modal logic with a resourcesensitive version of the logics of bringing-it-about: RSBIAT. Again, sound and complete Hilbert system and sequent calculus are provided. Proof-search in RSBIAT is PSPACE-easy. We also show how RSBIAT can be extended with the non-commutative language and thus represent sequentiality of actions. In Section 7, we motivate and discuss a number of applications of our system to represent and reason about artefacts.\n2 MILL and modal Kripke resource models\nWe introduce the most basic language studied in this paper. The language LMILL is given by the BNF:\nA ::= 1 | p | A\u2297A | A&A | A\u22b8 A | A\nwhere p \u2208 Atom. It is a modal version of what corresponds to the language of propositional intuitionistic Linear Logic, but without the additive disjunction and the additive units. This propositional part can also be seen as the fragment of BI (O\u2019Hearn and Pym, 1999) without additive disjunction and implication.\nLet us first concentrate on the propositional part for which a semantics already exists in the literature. We call the logic ILL and LILL its language. A Kripke-like class of models for ILL is basically due to Urquhart (Urquhart, 1972). A Kripke resource frame is a structure M = (M, e, \u25e6,\u2265), where (M, e, \u25e6) is a commutative monoid with neutral element e, and \u2265 is a pre-order on M . The frame has to satisfy the condition of bifunctoriality: if m \u2265 n, and m\u2032 \u2265 n\u2032, then m \u25e6 m\u2032 \u2265 n \u25e6 n\u2032. To obtain a Kripke resource model, a valuation on atoms V : Atom \u2192 P(M) is added. It has to satisfy the heredity condition: if m \u2208 V (p) and n \u2265 m then n \u2208 V (p).\nThe truth conditions of LILL in the Kripke resource modelM = (M, e, \u25e6,\u2265, V ) of the formulas of the propositional part are the following:\nm |=M p iff m \u2208 V (p).\nm |=M 1 iff m \u2265 e.\nm |=M A\u2297B iff there exist m1 and m2 such that m \u2265 m1 \u25e6m2 and m1 |=M A and m2 |=M B.\nm |=M A&B iff m |=M A and m |=M B.\nm |=M A\u22b8 B iff for all n \u2208M , if n |=M A, then n \u25e6m |=M B.\nObserve that heredity can be shown to extend naturally to every formula, in the sense that:\nProposition 1. For every formula A \u2208 LILL, if m |= A and m\u2032 \u2265 m, then m\u2032 |= A.\nNotations. An intuitionistic negation can be added to the language. We simply choose a designated atom \u22a5 \u2208 Atom and decide to conventionally interpret \u22a5 as indicating a contradiction. Negation is then defined by means of implication as \u223c A \u2261 A \u22b8 \u22a5 (Kanovich et al., 2006): the occurrence of A yields the contradiction. There will be no specific rule for negation.\nGiven a multiset of formulas, it will be useful to combine them into a unique formula. We adopt the following notation: \u2205\u2217 = 1, and \u2206\u2217 = A1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 Ak when \u2206 = {A1, . . . , Ak}.\nDenote ||A||M the extension of A in M, i.e. the set of worlds of M in which A holds. A formula A is true in a model M if e |=M A.1 A formula A is valid in Kripke resource frames, noted |= A, iff it is true in every model.\nModal Kripke resource models. Now, to give a meaning to the modality, we define a neighbourhood semantics on top of the Kripke resource frame. A neighbourhood function is a mapping N : M \u2192 P(P(M)) that associates a world m with a set of sets of worlds. (See (Chellas, 1980).) We define:\nm |= A iff ||A|| \u2208 N(m)\nThis is not enough, though. It is possible that m |= A, yet m\u2032 6|= A for some m\u2032 \u2265 m. That is, Proposition 1 does not hold with the simple extension of |= for LMILL. (One disastrous consequence is that the resulting logic does not satisfy the modus ponens or the cut rule.) We could define the clause concerning the modality alternatively as: m |= A iff there is n \u2208 M , such that m \u2265 n and ||A|| \u2208 N(n). However, this is bothersome because this is not how a non-normal modality is traditionally defined (Chellas, 1980).\nInstead, we will require our neighbourhood function to satisfy the condition that if some set X \u2286 M is in the neighbourhood of a world, then X is also in the neighbourhood of all \u201cgreater\u201d worlds.2 Formally, our modal Linear Logic is evaluated over the following models:\nDefinition 1. A modal Kripke resource model is a structure M = (M, e, \u25e6,\u2265 , N, V ) such that:\n\u2022 (M, e, \u25e6,\u2265) is a Kripke resource frame;\n\u2022 N is a neighbourhood function such that:\nif X \u2208 N(m) and n \u2265 m then X \u2208 N(n) (1)\nIt is readily checked that Proposition 1 is true as well for LMILL over modal Kripke resource models for modal formulas. We thus have:\nProposition 2. For every formula A \u2208 LMILL, if m |= A and m\u2032 \u2265 m, then m\u2032 |= A.\n3 Hilbert system for MILL and soundness\nThis part extends the Hilbert system for ILL from (Troelstra, 1992) and (Avron, 1988). We define the Hilbert-style calculus H-MILL for MILL by defining the following notion of deduction.\n1When no confusion can arise we will write ||A|| instead of ||A||M, and m |= A instead of m |=M A.\n2An analogous yet less transparent condition was used in (D\u2019Agostino et al., 1997) for a normal modality.\nDefinition 2 (Deduction in H-MILL). A deduction tree in H-MILL D is inductively constructed as follows. (i) The leaves of the tree are assumptions A \u22a2H A, for A \u2208 LMILL, or \u22a2H B where B is an axiom in Table 1 (base cases). (ii) We denote by D\n\u0393 \u22a2H A a deduction tree with conclusion \u0393 \u22a2H A. If D and D\u2032 are deduction trees, then the following are deduction trees (inductive steps).\nD \u0393 \u22a2H A D\u2032\n\u0393\u2032 \u22a2H A\u22b8 B \u22b8-rule\n\u0393,\u0393\u2032 \u22a2H B\nD \u0393 \u22a2H A D\u2032\n\u0393 \u22a2H B &-rule\n\u0393 \u22a2H A&B\nD \u22a2H A\u22b8 B D\u2032\n\u22a2H B \u22b8 A (re)\n\u22a2H A\u22b8 B\nWe sometimes refer to the \u22b8-rule as modus ponens. We say that A is deducible from \u0393 in H-MILL and we write \u0393 \u22a2H-MILL A iff there exists a deduction tree in H-MILL with conclusion \u0393 \u22a2H A. The deduction without assumptions, i.e. \u22a2H-MILL A, is just a special case of the above definition.\nIn general when defining Hilbert systems for linear logics, we need to be careful in the definition of derivation from assumptions: since \u0393 is a multiset, we need to handle occurrences of hypothesis when applying for instance modus ponens. From Definition 2, every formula in a derivation, except for the conclusion, is used exactly once as premise of modus ponens (Avron, 1988). With respect to this notion of derivation, the deduction theorem holds.\nTheorem 3 (Deduction theorem for H-MILL). If \u0393, A \u22a2H-MILL B then \u0393 \u22a2H-MILL A\u22b8 B.\nProof. The deduction theorem holds for the propositional fragment ILL, see (Troelstra, 1992, pp. 66-68). The only case to consider is the rule (re). However this trivially holds because the contexts of the sequents in the rule are empty.\nRemark. We defined the rule (re) in that particular way because of the deduction theorem. With the above formulation, the deduction theorem is preserved in MILL. Moreover, by our definition of deduction tree, this version entails the rule (re\u2019): from two deductions trees with conclusion A \u22a2H B and B \u22a2H A, we can build a deduction tree with conclusion A \u22a2H B.\nWe claim that (re) implies (re\u2019). Assume the premises of (re\u2019): there are two deduction trees with conclusions A \u22a2H B and B \u22a2H A. In virtue of Theorem 3 and the definition of \u22a2H-MILL, we know there are two trees with conclusions \u22a2H A \u22b8 B and \u22a2H B \u22b8 A. Thus by (re), we can build a deduction tree with conclusion \u22a2H A \u22b8 B. Together with A \u22a2H A (a leaf), the \u22b8-rule gives us a deduction tree with conclusion A \u22a2H B.\nWith the version (re\u2019), the deduction theorem fails, as we do not have any axiom that talks about the modality in this case.\nWe can prove the soundness of H-MILL wrt. our semantics.\nTheorem 4 (Soundness of H-MILL). If \u0393 \u22a2H-MILL A then, for every model, \u0393 |= A (namely, e |= (\u0393)\u2217 \u22b8 A).\nProof. We only give the arguments of the proof of soundness for two representative cases.\nSoundness of \u22b8-rule. We show now that \u22b8-rule preserves validity. Namely, we prove, by induction on the length of the derivation tree that if (1) e |= \u0393 \u22b8 A and (2) e |= \u0393\u2032 \u22b8 (A\u22b8 B), then e |= \u0393\u2297\u0393\u2032 \u22b8 B. The first assumption entails that for all x, if x |= \u0393, then x |= A. The second assumption entails that for all y, if y |= \u0393\u2032, then y |= A\u22b8 B. Thus, for all t, if t |= A, then y \u25e6 t |= B.\nLet z |= \u0393 \u2297 \u0393\u2032, thus there exist z1 and z2 such that z1 |= \u0393, z2 |= \u0393\u2032 and z \u2265 z1 \u25e6 z2. By (1), we have that z1 |= A and, by (2), z2 |= A \u22b8 B, thus z1 \u25e6 z2 |= B, and by Proposition 2 we have that z |= B.3\nSoundness of (re). We show that (re) preserves validity, namely, if e |= A\u22b8 B and e |= B \u22b8 A, then e |= A \u22b8 B. Our assumptions imply that, for all x, if x |= A, then x |= B, and if x |= B then x |= A. Thus, ||A|| = ||B||. We need to show that for all x, if x |= A, then x |= B. By definition, x |= A iff ||A|| \u2208 N(x). Thus, since ||A|| = ||B||, we have that ||B|| \u2208 N(x), that means x |= B.\n4 Sequent calculus MILL and completeness\nIn this section, we introduce the sequent calculus for our logic. A sequent is a statement \u0393 \u22a2 A where \u0393 is a finite multiset of occurrences of formulas of MILL and A is a formula. The fact that we allow for a single formula in the conclusions of the sequent corresponds to the fact that we are working with the intuitionistic version of the calculus (Girard, 1987).\n3Remember that Proposition 2 holds for the modal language LMILL because of Condition (1) on modal Kripke resource models.\nSince in a sequent \u0393 \u22a2 A we identify \u0393 to a multiset of formulas, the exchange rule\u2014the reshuffling of \u0393\u2014is implicit.\nA sequent \u0393 \u22a2 A where \u0393 = A1, . . . , An is valid in a modal Kripke resource frame iff the formula A1 \u2297 . . .\u2297An \u22b8 A is valid, namely |= \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 A.\nWe obtain the sequent calculus for our minimal modal logic MILL by extending the language of ILL with modal formulas and by adding a new rule. Saturating the notation, we label the sequent calculus rule like the rule for equivalents in the Hilbert system: (re). The calculus is shown in Table 2.\nTo establish a link with the previous section, we first show that provability in sequent calculus is equivalent to provability in the Hilbert system.\nTheorem 5. It holds that \u0393 \u22a2H-MILL A iff the sequent \u0393 \u22a2 A is derivable in the sequent calculus for MILL.\nProof. (Sketch) The propositional cases are proved in (Avron, 1988), we only need to extend it for the case of the modal rules. This is done by induction on the length of the proof. For instance, in one direction, assume that a derivation D of \u22a2H A\u22b8 B is obtained by D\u2032 of \u22a2H A\u22b8 B and D\u2032\u2032 of \u22a2H B \u22b8 A. By definition of deduction and of \u22a2H-MILL, we have that A \u22a2H-MILL B and B \u22a2H-MILL A. By induction hypothesis, we have that A \u22a2 B and B \u22a2 A are provable in the sequent calculus. Thus, by (re) and \u22b8 R, we have that \u22a2 A \u22b8 B is provable in the sequent calculus.\nCrucially, the modal extension does not affect cut elimination.\nTheorem 6. Cut elimination holds for MILL.\nProof. (Sketch) Cut elimination holds for Linear Logic (Girard, 1987). The proof forMILL largely adapts the proof for Linear Logic (Troelstra, 1992). Recall\nthat the rank of a cut is the complexity of the cut formula. The cutrank of a proof is the maximum of the ranks of the cuts in the proof. The level of a cut is the length of the subproof ending in the cut, (Troelstra, 1992). The proof of cut elimination proceeds by induction on the cutrank of the proof. It is enough to assume that the occurrence of the cut with maximal rank is the last rule of the proof. The inductive step shows how to replace a proof ending in a cut with rank n with a proof with the same conclusion and smaller cutrank. The proof of the inductive step proceeds by induction on the level of the terminal cut, namely on the length of the proof. Note that if one of the premises of a cut is an axiom, then we can simply eliminate the cut. Given a sequent rule R, the occurrence of a formula A in the conclusion of R is principal if A has been introduced by R. As usual, there are two main cases to consider: first, the cut formula is principal in both premises of the terminal cut rule, and second, that is not the case. First main case. We replace the cut of maximal rank with two cuts with strictly smaller rank. For example, take the case in which C is the cut formula and is principal in both premises (i.e. it has been introduced by (re)):\nB \u22a2 C C \u22a2 B (re) B \u22a2 C C \u22a2 D D \u22a2 C (re) C \u22a2 D\ncut B \u22a2 D\nIt is reduced by replacing the cut on C by two cuts on C with strictly smaller rank.\nB \u22a2 C C \u22a2 D cut B \u22a2 D D \u22a2 C C \u22a2 B cut D \u22a2 B\n(re) B \u22a2 D\nSecond main case. The cut formula is not principal in one of the premises of the cut rule. Suppose R is the rule that does not introduce the cut formula. In this case, we can apply the cut after R. By induction, the proof minus R can be turned into a cut-free proof, since the length of the subproof is smaller and the cutrank is equal or smaller. By applying again R to the cut-free proof, we obtain a proof with the same conclusion of the starting proof and less cuts.\nFor example,\nB \u22a2 C C \u22a2 B (re) B \u22a2 C ... R \u0393, C \u22a2 A\ncut B,\u0393 \u22a2 A\ncan be turned into:\nB \u22a2 C C \u22a2 B (re) B \u22a2 C ...\n\u0393\u2032, C \u22a2 A\u2032 cut\nB,\u0393\u2032 \u22a2 A\u2032 \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u22a2 A\u2032\u2032 R\nB,\u0393 \u22a2 A\nBy inspecting the rules others than cut, it is easy to see that cut elimination entails the subformula property, namely if \u0393 \u22a2 A is derivable, then there is a derivation containing subformulas of \u0393 and A only.\nThe decidability remains to be established. We can show that the proofsearch for MILL is no more costly than the proof-search for propositional intuitionistic multiplicative additive linear logic (Lincoln et al., 1992).\nTheorem 7. Proof search complexity for MILL is in PSPACE.\nProof. (Sketch) The proof adapts the argument in (Lincoln et al., 1992). By cut elimination, Theorem 6, for every provable sequent in MILL there is a cutfree proof with same conclusion. For every rule in MILL other than (cut), the premises have a strictly lower complexity wrt. the conclusion. Hence, for every provable sequent, there is a proof whose branches have a depth at most linear in the size of the sequent. The size of a branch is at most quadratic in the size of the conclusion. And it contains only subformulas of the conclusion sequent because of the subformula property. This means that one can non-deterministically guess such a proof, and check each branch one by one using only a polynomial space. Proof search is then in NPSPACE = PSPACE.\nWe present the proof of completeness of MILL wrt. the class of modal Kripke resource frames.\nTheorem 8 (Completeness of the sequent calculus). If |= \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 A then \u0393 \u22a2 A.\nThe proof can be summarised as follow. We build a canonical modelMc (Definition 3). In particular, the setM c of states consists in the set of finite multisets of formulas, and the neutral element ec is the empty multiset. We first need to show that it is indeed a modal Kripke resource model (Lemma 9). Second we need to show a correspondence, the \u201cTruth Lemma\u201d, between \u22a2 and truth in Mc. Precisely we show that for a formula A and a multiset of formulas \u0393 \u2208M c, it is the case that \u0393 satisfies A iff \u0393 \u22a2 A is provable in the calculus (Lemma 10). Finally, to show completeness, assume that it is not the case that \u22a2 \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 A. By the Truth Lemma, it means that in the canonical model \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 A is not satisfied at ec. So Mc does not satisfy \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 A. So it is not the case that |= \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 A.\nWe construct the canonical model Mc, then we prove that Mc is a modal Kripke resource model, and we prove the Truth Lemma.\nIn the following, \u2294 is the multiset union. Also, | A |c= {\u0393 | \u0393 \u22a2 A}.\nDefinition 3. Let Mc = (M c, ec, \u25e6c,\u2265c, N c, V c) such that:\n\u2022 M c = {\u0393 | \u0393 is a finite multiset of formulas};\n\u2022 \u0393 \u25e6c \u2206 = \u0393 \u2294\u2206;\n\u2022 ec = \u2205;\n\u2022 \u0393 \u2265c \u2206 iff \u0393 \u22a2 \u2206\u2217;\n\u2022 \u0393 \u2208 V c(p) iff \u0393 \u22a2 p;\n\u2022 N c(\u0393) = {| A |c| \u0393 \u22a2 A}.\nLemma 9. Mc is a modal Kripke resource model.\nProof. 1. (M c, ec, \u25e6c,\u2265c) is the \u201cright type\u201d of ordered monoid: (i) (M c, ec, \u25e6c) is a commutative monoid with neutral element ec, and (ii) \u2265c is a pre-order on M c. Finally, (iii) if \u0393 \u2265c \u2206 and \u0393\u2032 \u2265c \u2206\u2032 then \u0393 \u25e6c \u0393\u2032 \u2265c \u2206 \u25e6c \u2206\u2032.\nFor (i), commutativity (and associativity) follow from the definition of \u25e6c as the multiset union, and the neutrality of ec follows from it being the empty multiset\u2014the neutral element of the multiset union.\nFor (ii), \u2265c is reflexive because {A1, . . . , An} \u22a2 {A1, . . . , An}\u2217 can be proved from the axioms (ax) Ak \u22a2 Ak, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, and by applying \u2297R n \u2212 1 times. The key rule to establish that \u2265c is transitive is cut.\nFor (iii), assume \u0393 \u2265c \u2206 and \u0393\u2032 \u2265c \u2206\u2032, that is, \u0393 \u22a2 \u2206\u2217 and \u0393\u2032 \u22a2 \u2206\u2032\u2217. By \u2297R we have \u0393,\u0393\u2032 \u22a2 \u2206\u2217 \u2297 \u2206\u2032\u2217. By applying the definitions we end up with \u0393 \u2294 \u0393\u2032 \u22a2 (\u2206 \u2294\u2206\u2032)\u2217 and the expected result follows.\n2. V c is a valuation function and satisfies heredity: if \u0393 \u2208 V (p) and \u2206 \u2265c \u0393 then \u2206 \u2208 V (p). To see this, suppose \u0393 \u22a2 p and \u2206 \u22a2 \u0393\u2217. By applying \u2297L enough times, we have \u0393\u2217 \u22a2 p. By cut, we obtain \u2206 \u22a2 p.\n3. N c is well-defined: Suppose that | A |c=| B |c. We need to show that | A |c\u2208 N c(\u0393) iff | B |c\u2208 N c(\u0393).\nFrom | A |c=| B |c, we have \u0393 \u22a2 A \u21d2 \u0393 \u22a2 B. In particular, we have A \u22a2 A\u21d2 A \u22a2 B. Hence, A \u22a2 B is provable (by rule (ax)). We show symmetrically that B \u22a2 A is provable.\nFrom A \u22a2 B and B \u22a2 A, we have by rule (re) that A \u22a2 B is provable, and also that B \u22a2 A is provable.\nNow suppose that \u0393 \u22a2 A. Since A \u22a2 B is provable, we obtain by cut that \u0393 \u22a2 B is provable. Symmetrically, suppose that \u0393 \u22a2 B. Since B \u22a2 A is provable, we obtain by cut that \u0393 \u22a2 A is provable.\nHence, we have that \u0393 \u22a2 A iff \u0393 \u22a2 B. By definition of N c, it means that | A |c\u2208 N c(\u0393) iff | B |c\u2208 N c(\u0393).\n4. If X \u2208 N c(\u0393) and \u2206 \u2265c \u0393 then X \u2208 N c(\u2206). To see that this is the case, the hypotheses are equivalent to \u0393 \u22a2 A for some A such that | A |c= X , and \u2206 \u22a2 \u0393\u2217. By repeatedly applying \u2297L to obtain \u0393\u2217 \u22a2 A and by using cut, we infer that \u2206 \u22a2 A. Which is equivalent to the statement that X \u2208 N c(\u2206).\nLet us then note |=c the truth relation in Mc.\nLemma 10. \u0393 |=c A iff \u0393 \u22a2 A.\nProof. By induction on the complexity of A. For induction, we suppose that the lemma holds for all atomic formulas. The cases of the propositional connectives are found in (Kamide, 2003). We prove here the case A = B.\nWe have the following sequence of equivalences of \u0393 |=c B:\niff || B ||M c \u2208 N c(\u0393), by definition of |=c;\niff {\u2206 | \u2206 |=c B} \u2208 N c(\u0393), by definition of || . ||M c ;\niff {\u2206 | \u2206 \u22a2 B} \u2208 N c(\u0393), by Induction Hypothesis;\niff | B |c\u2208 N c(\u0393), by definition of | . |c;\niff \u0393 \u22a2 B, by definition of N c.\nWe could now prove that the sequent calculus is sound, and we could adapt our proof of Theorem 8 to prove that the Hilbert system H-MILL is complete. But we are already there; We have the following:\n\u2022 if \u0393 \u22a2H-MILL A then e |= \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 A (Theorem 4);\n\u2022 if e |= \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 A then \u0393 \u22a2 A (Theorem 8);\n\u2022 if \u0393 \u22a2 A then \u0393 \u22a2H-MILL A (Theorem 5).\nTherefore, the completeness of the Hilbert system and the soundness of the sequent calculus both follow.\nCorollary 11. We have:\n\u2022 if e |= \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 A then \u0393 \u22a2H-MILL A;\n\u2022 if \u0393 \u22a2 A then e |= \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 A."}, {"heading": "5 Adding non-commutativity", "text": "Systems that integrate a commutative Linear Logic with a non-commutative one have been studied in (Abrusci and Ruet, 1999; De Groote, 1996; Retore\u0301, 1997). Note that the purely non-commutative version of intuitionistic Linear Logic is basically the calculus with two order sensitive implications developed by Lambek (Lambek, 1958). The basic propositional logic that we use is provided by (De Groote, 1996) and labelled PCL, partially commutative Linear Logic. The main novelty is that the structural rule of exchange no longer holds in general. The context of a sequent is now only partially commutative, and is now built by means of two constructors. Thus, we essentially use context as a shorthand for partially commutative context. Every formula (to be defined shortly after) is a context. Then, for every context \u0393 and \u2206, we can build their parallel composition (\u0393,\u2206) (primarily commutative context) and their serial\ncomposition (\u0393;\u2206) (primarily non-commutative context) (Be\u0301chet et al., 1997). A context can thus be seen as finite tree with non-leaf nodes labelled with \u2018;\u2019 or \u2018,\u2019 and with leafs labelled by formulas. Two branches emanating from a \u2018,\u2019 commute with each other, while the branches emanating from a \u2018;\u2019 node do not. We write () for the empty context, and assume that it acts as the identity element of the parallel and serial composition, that is: ((),\u0393) = (\u0393, ()) = ((); \u0393) = (\u0393; ()) = \u0393. We denote by \u0393[\u2212] a context \u201cwith a hole\u201d, and \u0393[\u2206] denotes this very context with the \u201chole filled\u201d with the context \u2206.\nThe language of PCMILL extends the language of MILL by adding the following operators: the non-commutative tensor noted \u2299 and the two order sensitive implications noted \\ and /:\nA ::= 1 | p | A\u2297A | A&A | A\u22b8 A | A\u2299A | A \\A | A/A | A\nwhere p \u2208 Atom. In order to blend together commutative and non-commutative sequence, we have to choose what is the interpretation of commutativity, namely if we view a commutative concurrent process such as A\u2297B as entailing that either directions are allowed (Be\u0301chet et al., 1997; De Groote, 1996). That is, parallel composition is weaker than serial composition, so it shall hold that A \u2297 B \u22b8 A \u2299 B. This means that if two resources can be combined with no particular order, then they can be combined sequentially. This choice is reflected by the structural rule of entropy (ent) below. The first two lines of Table 3 state the associativity of serial and parallel compositions, the third line states the commutativity of parallel composition and the entropy principle.\nSemantics and completeness. In order to define a class of modal Kripke resource models for PCMILL, we extend the models we have considered in Section 2. We add to a modal Kripke resource model (M, e, \u25e6,\u2265, N, V ) an associative, non-commutative operation \u2022 such that e is neutral also for \u2022. Thus, a Kripke resource model is now specified by M = (M, e, \u25e6, \u2022,\u2265, N, V ). Bifunctoriality is assumed also for \u2022: if m \u2265 n, and m\u2032 \u2265 n\u2032, then m \u2022m\u2032 \u2265 n \u2022 n\u2032. Moreover, the entropy principle is captured in the models by means of the following constraint: for all x, y, x \u25e6 y \u2265 x \u2022 y. If M satisfies all these conditions, we call it a partially commutative modal Kripke resource model.\nThe new truth conditions are the following:\nm |=M A\u2299B iff there exist m1 and m2 such that m \u2265 m1 \u2022m2 and m1 |=M A and m2 |=M B.\nm |=M A \\B iff for all n \u2208M , if n |=M A, then n \u2022m |=M B.\nm |=M B/A iff for all n \u2208M , if n |=M A, then m \u2022 n |=M B.\nNote that, if m |= A \u2297 B, then by m1 \u25e6m2 \u2265 m1 \u2022m2 and heredity, we have that m |= A\u2299B.\nWe shall prove soundness and completeness of PCMILL.

For completeness, we need to extend the construction of the canonical model in order to account for the non-commutative structure.\nAs before, a context can be associated to a unique formula by means of a recursive operation, here .+. We adopt the following definition:\n()+ = 1\n(A)+ = A\n(\u0393,\u2206)+ = (\u0393+ \u2297\u2206+)\n(\u0393;\u2206)+ = (\u0393+ \u2299\u2206+)\nLet Mc\u2022 = (M c, ec, \u25e6c, \u2022c,\u2265c, N c, V c) such that: M c = {\u0393 | \u0393 is a partially commutative context}; ec = (); \u0393 \u25e6c \u2206 = (\u0393,\u2206); \u0393 \u2022c \u2206 = (\u0393;\u2206); \u0393 \u2265c \u2206 iff \u0393 \u22a2 \u2206+; \u0393 \u2208 V c(p) iff \u0393 \u22a2 p; N c(\u0393) = {| A |c| \u0393 \u22a2 A}.\nWe will show that Mc\u2022 is actually a partially commutative modal Kripke resource model. It suffices to adapt and extend the proof of Lemma 9. Important bits are:\n1. ec is neutral for \u2022c;\n2. associativity of \u2022c;\n3. for all \u0393,\u2206 \u2208M c: \u0393 \u25e6c \u2206 \u2265c \u0393 \u2022c \u2206;\n4. \u0393 \u2265c \u2206 and \u0393\u2032 \u2265c \u2206\u2032 then \u0393 \u2022c \u0393\u2032 \u2265c \u2206 \u2022c \u2206\u2032;\n5. If X \u2208 N c(\u0393) and \u0393 \u2265c \u2206 then X \u2208 N c(\u2206).\nWe sketch the arguments here. Item 1 and item 2 follow from the definition of partially commutative contexts. We look at the case of entropy (item 3) with more attention. By repeated use of (ax), \u2297R, and \u2299R, we can show (\u0393;\u2206) \u22a2 (\u0393;\u2206)+. By (ent), we obtain (\u0393,\u2206) \u22a2 (\u0393;\u2206)+, and apply the definition of \u2265c to have (\u0393,\u2206) \u2265c (\u0393;\u2206)+. By definition of \u25e6c we have (\u0393\u25e6c\u2206) \u2265c (\u0393;\u2206)+. Call In the latter inequality. Now, by (ax), we have (\u0393;\u2206)+ \u22a2 (\u0393;\u2206)+, which by definition of \u2265c is equivalent to (\u0393;\u2206)+ \u2265c (\u0393;\u2206). By definition of \u2022c, we have (\u0393;\u2206)+ \u2265c (\u0393 \u2022c \u2206). Together with In, we have (\u0393 \u25e6c \u2206) \u2265c (\u0393 \u2022c \u2206).\nTo start with item 4, assume \u0393 \u2265c \u2206 and \u0393\u2032 \u2265c \u2206\u2032, that is by definition of \u2265c, \u0393 \u22a2 \u2206+ and \u0393\u2032 \u22a2 \u2206\u2032+. By \u2299R, we have (\u0393; \u0393\u2032) \u22a2 \u2206+ \u2299 \u2206\u2032+. By the definition of .+, it means that (\u0393; \u0393\u2032) \u22a2 (\u2206;\u2206\u2032)+. Again by definition of \u2265c, we have (\u0393; \u0393\u2032) \u2265c (\u2206;\u2206\u2032). Finally by definition of \u2022c we conclude that (\u0393 \u2022c \u0393\u2032) \u2265c (\u2206 \u2022c \u2206\u2032).\nItem 5 is almost identical to the same case in the proof of Lemma 9, but we explicitly adapt it here. The hypotheses are equivalent to \u0393 \u22a2 A for some A such that | A |c= X , and \u2206 \u22a2 \u0393+. By repeatedly applying \u2297L and \u2299L to obtain \u0393+ \u22a2 A and by using cut, we infer that \u2206 \u22a2 A. Which is equivalent to the statement that X \u2208 N c(\u2206).\nThe truth lemma can be checked by routine induction. Thus we can conclude.\nTheorem 12.

Hence, from the rule of equivalents, and the axiom \u22a2 \u00acEa\u22a4 that indicates than no agent brings about the tautological constant, one can deduce \u22a2 \u00acEaA whenever the formula A is a theorem. In Linear Logic, the unity 1 is not provably equivalent to all theorems. Thus, the axiom of BIAT must be changed into an inference rule (\u223c nec) in RSBIAT: if \u22a2 A, then EaA \u22a2 \u22a5. It is effectively a sort of \u201canti-necessitation rule\u201d. So, if a formula is a theorem, if an agent brings it about, then the contradiction is entailed. This amounts to negating EaA, according to intuitionistic negation, for every tautological formula A.\nThe principle of BIAT for combining actions (item 3 in the list) is open to two interpretations here: a multiplicative one and an additive one. The additive combination means that if there is a choice for agent a between bringing about\nA and bringing about B, then agent a can bring about a choice between A and B. Ea\u2297 means that if an agent a brings about action A and brings about action B then a brings about both actions A\u2297 B. Moreover, in order to bring about A\u2297B, the sum of the resources for A and the resources for B is required.\nFinally, the logics of the minimal modality already satisfy the rule of equivalents for Ea: from A \u22a2 B and B \u22a2 A we infer EaA \u22a2 EaB. This is inherited by RSBIAT, and it is all that is needed to capture the principle of item 4.\nWe enrich H-MILL, the Hilbert system for MILL, as follows and we label this system H-RSBIAT. We add the following axioms.\nThe definition of deduction in H-RSBIAT extends the definition of deduction in H-MILL (Definition 2) with the following possible rule to consider for the inductive steps.\nD\n\u22a2H A (\u223c nec) \u22a2H EaA\u22b8 \u22a5\nOn the side of the semantics, we propose the following conditions on modal Kripke resource frames (M, e, \u25e6,\u2265, {Na}, V ). The rule (\u223c nec) requires:\nif (X \u2208 Na(w)) and (e \u2208 X) then (w \u2208 V (\u22a5)) (2)\nThe rule (Ea(refl)) requires:\nif X \u2208 Na(w) then w \u2208 X (3)\nThe condition corresponding to the multiplicative version of action combination (Ea\u2297) is the following, where X \u25e6 Y = {x \u25e6 y | x \u2208 X and y \u2208 Y }, and X\u2191 = {y | y \u2265 x and x \u2208 X}:\nif X \u2208 Na(x) and Y \u2208 Na(y) , then (X \u25e6 Y ) \u2191 \u2208 Na(x \u25e6 y) (4)\nThe condition on the frames corresponding to the additive version is the following:\nif X \u2208 Na(x) and Y \u2208 Na(x), then X \u2229 Y \u2208 Na(x) (5)\nNext, we introduce a sequent calculus for RSBIAT. The rules of RSBIAT for E& show that in order to bring about the choice between A & B is enough to use the resources for one of the two. On the contrary, in order to bring about A\u2297B, the sum of the resources for A and the resources for B is required.\nWe can prove that H-RSBIAT and the sequent calculus for RSBIAT are equivalent.\nProposition 13. It holds that \u0393 \u22a2H-RSBIAT A iff \u0393 \u22a2 A is derivable in RSBIAT.\nProof. (Sketch) The proof is again an induction on the length of derivations. For example, in one direction, axiom EaA \u2297 EaB \u22b8 Ea(A \u2297 B) is derivable in the sequent calculus by simply applying \u2297L and \u22b8 R to EaA,EaB \u22a2 Ea(A\u2297B) which has been obtained from axioms by means of Ea\u2297.\nWe can now prove soundness and completeness of RSBIAT.\nTheorem 14. RSBIAT is sound and complete wrt. the class of modal Kripke frames that satisfy (2), (3), (4), and (5).\nProof. (Sketch) We just show two correspondences. Condition (2) and rule (\u223cnec). (\u223cnec) is sound. Assume that for every model, e |= A. We need to show that e |= EaA \u22b8 \u22a5. That is, for every x, if x |= EaA, then x models \u22a5. If x |= EaA, then by definition, ||A|| \u2208 Na(x). Since A is a theorem, e \u2208 ||A||, thus by Condition 2, x \u2208 V (\u22a5), so x |= \u22a5. For completeness, it suffices to adapt our canonical model construction. Build the canonical model for RSBIAT as in Def. 3 (we have now more valid sequents). Now suppose (1) X \u2208 N ca(\u0393), and (2) e c \u2208 X . By definition of N ca and of | . | c, there is A, s.t. | A |c= X , (1) \u0393 \u22a2 EaA and (2) \u22a2 A. From (2), and (\u223cnec): EaA \u22a2 \u22a5. From (1), and previous, we obtain \u0393 \u22a2 \u22a5 using (cut). By definition of V c, \u0393 \u2208 V c(\u22a5).\nCondition (4) and rule (Ea\u2297). (Ea\u2297) is sound. Assume e |= \u0393\u2217 \u22b8 EaA and e |= \u2206\u2217 \u22b8 EaB. Then, for all x that make \u0393 true, ||A|| \u2208 Na(x) and for all y that make \u2206 true, ||B|| \u2208 Na(y). By (4), ||A|| \u25e6 ||B|| \u2208 Na(x \u25e6 y), so for any x \u25e6 y that make (\u0393,\u2206)\u2217 true, x \u25e6 y |= Ea(A \u2297 B). For completeness, suppose X \u2208 N ca(\u0393) and Y \u2208 N c a(\u2206). By definition of N c a and of | . |\nc, there is A and B, with | A |c= X , and | B |c= Y , s.t. \u0393 \u22a2 EaA, and \u2206 \u22a2 EaB. By (Ea\u2297), we obtain \u0393,\u2206 \u22a2 Ea(A\u2297B) and thus | A\u2297B |c\u2208 N ca(\u0393 \u2294\u2206) by definition of | . |\nc. The definition of \u25e6c gives us | A\u2297B |c\u2208 N ca(\u0393 \u25e6\nc \u2206). By the Truth Lemma, we have that ||A\u2297B||M c\n\u2208 N ca(\u0393 \u25e6 c \u2206). Thus (X \u25e6c Y )\u2191 \u2208 N ca(\u0393 \u25e6 c \u2206).\nTherefore, also our extensions of Hilbert systems and sequent calculus are sound and complete wrt. the modal Kripke resource frames restricted to the relevant conditions given in this section.\nCorollary 15. H-RSBIAT is sound and complete wrt. the class of modal Kripke frames that satisfy (2), (3), and (4).\nMoreover, RSBIAT enjoys cut elimination.\nTheorem 16. Cut elimination holds for RSBIAT.\nProof. (Sketch) We extend the proof of Theorem (6) by presenting a number of new cases for the cut formula being principal in both premises of the cut rule. The other cases can be treated similarly. The cut formula has been introduced by Ea(re) and \u223cnec\nA \u22a2 B B \u22a2 A Ea(re) EaA \u22a2 EaB \u22a2 B \u223cnec\nEaB \u22a2 \u22a5 cut\nEaA \u22a2 \u22a5\n\u22a2 B B \u22a2 A cut\n\u22a2 A \u223cnec EaA \u22a2 \u22a5\nThe cut formula has been introduced by Ea\u2297 and Ea(refl).\n\u0393\u2032 \u22a2 A ... \u0393 \u22a2 EaA\n\u2206\u2032 \u22a2 B ... \u2206 \u22a2 EaB\n\u0393,\u2206 \u22a2 Ea(A\u2297B)\n\u03a3\u2032, A \u22a2 C\u2032 \u03a3\u2032\u2032, B \u22a2 C\u2032\u2032\n\u03a3, A\u2297B \u22a2 C\n\u03a3,Ea(A\u2297B) \u22a2 C cut\n\u0393,\u2206,\u03a3 \u22a2 C\nIt can be reduced by pushing the cut upwards.\n\u0393\u2032 \u22a2 A \u03a3\u2032, A \u22a2 C\u2032 cut \u0393\u2032,\u03a3\u2032 \u22a2 C\u2032 \u2206\u2032 \u22a2 B \u03a3\u2032\u2032, B \u22a2 C\u2032\u2032\ncut \u2206\u2032,\u03a3\u2032\u2032 \u22a2 C\u2032\u2032 ...... ...\n\u0393,\u2206,\u03a3 \u22a2 C\nOnce again, it is easy to see that cut elimination entails the subformula property for RSBIAT. Using the same arguments as for Theorem 7, it is clear that we can decide polynomial space whether a sequent is valid in RSBIAT.\nTheorem 17. Proof search complexity for RSBIAT is in PSPACE.\n6.3 RSBIAT with sequences of actions\nSo far, we have discussed how to control weakening and contraction in order to provide a resource sensitive account of agency. There is one important structural rule that we did not discuss, namely the exchange rule. In this section, we extend RSBIAT by introducing the non-commutative multiplicative conjunction \u2299, and its two associated order-sensitive implications.\nThe significance of this move goes beyond the technical aspect, which is rather straightforward at that point. Indeed, a recurring point of contention against the logics of bringing-it-about is the absence of a basic notion of time.\nNon-commutative composition of formulas will provide to us an immediate and natural way of talking, if not about time proper, at least about sequences of actions. Reading A \u2299 B as \u201cfirst A then B\u201d, we will also read (EaA) \u2299 (EbB) as \u201cfirst a brings about A then b brings about B\u201d.\nWe obtain SRSBIAT by adding the non-commutative versions of Ea\u2297 and rephrasing the commutative rules by means of the context notation. The rule Ea(refl) can now operate both in commutative and non-commutative contexts.\nNote that the presentation of \u223cnec, Ea\u2297, and Ea& is not affected by the generalisation to partially commutative. Ea(refl) states that we can introduce the modality also in non-commutative contexts. Ea\u2299 adapts the principle of composition of actions (cf. item 3, p. 17) to sequences; it states that we can compose two ordered actions into one sequence of actions.\nIn order to offer a semantics to our extension of RSBIAT with sequences of actions, we need to add a condition on the neighbourhood functions that deals with the non-commutative operator. Specifically, we need the following condition:\nif X \u2208 Na(x) and Y \u2208 Na(y) , then (X \u2022 Y ) \u2191 \u2208 Na(x \u2022 y) (6)\nWe obtain naturally the semantic determination.\nTheorem 18. SRSBIAT is sound and complete wrt. the class of partially commutative modal Kripke resource models that satisfy (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6)."}, {"heading": "7 Application: manipulation of artefacts", "text": ""}, {"heading": "7.1 Artefacts", "text": "Our application lies in the reasoning about artefact\u2019s function and tool use. By endorsing what we may call an agential stance, we view artefacts as special kind of agents. They are characterised by the fact that they are designed by some other agent in order to achieve a purpose in a particular environment. An important aspect of the modelling of artefacts is their interaction with the environment and with the agents that use the artefact to achieve a specific goal (Borgo and Vieu, 2009; Garbacz, 2004; Houkes and Vermaas, 2010; Kroes, 2012). Briefly, we can view an artefact as an object that in presence of a number of preconditions c1, . . . , cn produces the outcome o. In this work, we want to represent the function of artefacts by means of logical formulas and to view\nthe correct behaviour of an artefact by means of a form of reasoning. When reasoning about artefacts and their outcomes, we need to be careful in making all the conditions of use of the artefact explicit, otherwise we end up facing the following unintuitive cases. Imagine we represent the behaviour of a screwdriver as a formula of classical logic that states that if there is a screw S, then we can tighten it T . We simply describe the behaviour of the artefact as a material implication S \u2192 T . In classical logic, we can infer that by means of a single screwdriver we can tighten two screws: S, S, S \u2192 T \u22a2 T \u2227 T . Worse, we do not even need to have two screws to begin with: S, S \u2192 T \u22a2 T \u2227 T . Thus, without specifying all the relevant constraints on the environment (e.g., that a screwdriver can handle one screw at the time) we end up with unintuitive results. Another possible drawback of classical logic is that it is commutative, the order of formulas does not matter. For example, if we describe the process of hammering a nail by means of the implication if I place a nail N and I provide the right force F , then I can drive a nail in (D), that is N \u2227F \u2192 D, that would entail also that one can put a force before placing the nail.\nMoreover, we need to specify the relationship between the artefact and the agents: for example, there are artefacts that can be used by one agent at the time. Since a crucial point in modelling artefacts is their interaction with the environment, either we carefully list all the relevant conditions, or we need to change the logical framework that we use to represent the artefact\u2019s behaviour. In this paper, we propose to pursue this second strategy. Our motivation is that, instead of specifying for each artefact the precondition of its application (e.g., that there is only one screw that a screw driver is supposed to operate on), the logical language that encodes the behaviour of the artefact already takes care of preventing unintuitive outcomes. Thus, the formulas of Linear Logic shall represent actions of agents and functions of artefacts, and the non-normal modality shall specify which agent or artefact brings about which process."}, {"heading": "7.2 Functions", "text": "The concept of a function of an artefact aims to capture the description of the behaviour of an artefact in an environment with respect to its goals: Artefacts are not living things but have a purpose, attributed by a designer or a user (Borgo and Vieu, 2009; Kroes, 2012). We model a function of an artefact by means of a formula A in RSBIAT or SRSBIAT. If A is a function of an artefact t, then one can represent t\u2019s behaviour as EtA (t brings about A) in a conceptually consistent manner, namely an artefact brings about its function A.\nWith Linear Logic, we are equipped with a formalism to represent and reason about processes and resources. In classical and intuitionistic logic, if one has A and A implies B, then one has B, but A still holds. This is fine for mathematical reasoning but often fails to be acceptable in the real world where implication is causal. Girard remarks that \u201c[a] causal implication cannot be iterated since the conditions are modified after its use; this process of modification of the premises (conditions) is known in physics as reaction.\u201d (Girard, 1989, p. 72)\nThat is, Linear Logic allows for modelling how the function of an artefact can be actually realised in a certain environment. At an abstract level, an artefact can be seen as an agent t. It takes resource-sensitive actions by reacting to the environment. When t is an artefact, and \u0393 \u22a2 EiA is provable, then also \u0393 \u22a2 A is provable, thus the occurrence of A in the proof represents the execution of a function of t in the environment \u0393. For any artefact t with function A, EtA, we say that t accomplishes a certain goal O in the environment \u0393 if and only if the sequent \u0393[EtA] \u22a2 O is provable. The context \u0393 describes a number of preconditions that specify the environment resources as well as the actions of the agents that are interacting with the artefact.\nThis view simply generalises to a number of artefacts as follows:\n\u0393[E1A1, . . . ,EmAm] \u22a2 O\nAgain, if the above sequent is provable, then the combination of artefacts E1A1, ..., EmAm can achieve the goal O in \u0393 by executing their functions A1, . . . , Am.\nDefining the function of an artefact as a formula demands some care because in this way functions do not have a unique formulation. The functions (A\u2297B) \u22b8 C, and A\u22b8 (B \u22b8 C) are provably equivalent. However, the rule Ea(re) ensures that bringing about a function is provably equivalent to bringing about any of its equivalent forms. By means of sequent calculus provability, we can view the problem of using artefacts in an environment to achieve a goal as a decision problem that is related to the AI problem of planning (Kanovich and Vauzeilles, 2001). Note that the complexity of deciding whether a goal is achievable depends only on the fragment of the logic that we use to model the formulas in the sequent. In the next paragraphs, we shall instantiate the descriptive features of our calculus by means of a number of toy example."}, {"heading": "7.3 Simple examples of functions", "text": "Take a very simple example. We can represent the function of a screwdriver s as an implication that states that if there is a screw (formula S) and some agent brings about the right rotational force (F ), then the screw gets tighten (T ).

Thus, we may reconsider our screwdriver as a \u201cnoncommutative\u201d screwdriver s\u2022 and write its function as S\u2299F \\T .

A number of aspects of the interaction between agents\u2019 actions and artefacts can be captured by means of the rules Ei\u2297, Ei\u2299, and Ei&. Recall that A is a set of agents. We write \u02d8\nx\u2208A ExA as a short hand for Ei1A& \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7& EimA. The latter formula means that any agent can perform A, so for example Ei1A& \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7&EimA \u22a2 EijA.\nAn artefact that is defined by Et( \u02d8\nx\u2208A(Ex(A\u2297B) \u22b8 O)) requires the same agent x to perform both actions A and B in order to get O. For example, a one person rowboat that requires a single agent to operate on both oars (R1) and (R2), in whatever order, so to produce movement (M). This is can be modelled by means of our Ei\u2297 rule.\nEiR1 \u22a2 EiR1 EiR2 \u22a2 EiR2 Ei\u2297\nEiR1,EiR2 \u22a2 Ei(R1 \u2297R2) M \u22a2M \u22b8L\nEiR1,EiR2,Ei((R1 \u2297R2) \u22b8M) \u22a2M &L enough times\nEiR1,EiR2, \u02d8\nx\u2208A Ei((R1 \u2297R2) \u22b8M) \u22a2M Et(refl)\nEiR1,EiR2,Et( \u02d8 x\u2208A Ei((R1 \u2297R2) \u22b8M)) \u22a2M\nOn the other hand, by specifying the function by Et( \u02d8\nx,y\u2208A,x 6=y(ExA \u2297 EyB) \u22b8 O), we are forcing the agents who operate tool t to be different (e.g., a crosscut saw). If an artefact\u2019s function does not determine whether the actions must be performed by the same agent, we can write Et( \u02d8\nx,y\u2208A(ExA\u2297EyB) \u22b8 O).\nIn the non-commutative case, Et( \u02d8\nx\u2208A Ex(A \u2299 B) \u22b8 O) forces the same agent to perform first A and then B, whereas Et( \u02d8\nx,y\u2208A,x 6=y(ExA\u2299EyB) \u22b8 O) forces the agents to be different. For example, the function of a hanging ladder\nis described as follows: firstly, an agent holds the laden (Ho), then another agent climbs up (Cl) and reaches a certain position R: Et(EaHo\u2299 EbCl \\ EbR).\nEaHo \u22a2 EaHo EbCl \u22a2 EbCl \u2299R\nEaHo;EbCl \u22a2 EaHo\u2299 EbCl EbR \u22a2 EbR \\L\nEaHo;EbCl;EaHo\u2299 EbCl \\ EbR \u22a2 EbR Et(refl)\nEaHo;EbCl;Et(EaHo\u2299 EbCl \\ EbR) \u22a2 EbR\nBy means of Ei&, we can describe a function that requires an agent\u2019s choice. For example, a monkey wrench can tighten two sizes of nuts/bolts (N1, N2) provided that an agent chooses the right measure (M1,M2): Et((Ei(M1&M2) \u22b8 EiN1) & (Ei(M1 & N2) \u22b8 EiN2)). The following proof shows that if a single agent can choose the right measure for the nut (e.g., M1), then the same agent can tighten the right type of nut (e.g., EiN1)\nEiM1 \u22a2 EiM1 &L\nEiM1 & EiM2 \u22a2 EiM1\nEiM2 \u22a2 EiM2 &R\nEiM1 & EiM2 \u22a2 EiM2 Ei&\nEiM1 & EiM2 \u22a2 Ei(M1 &M2) EiN1 \u22a2 EiN1 \u22b8L\nEiM1 & EiM2,Ei(M1 &M2) \u22b8 EiN1 \u22a2 EiN1 &L\nEiM1 & EiM2, (Ei(M1 &M2) \u22b8 EiN1) & (Ei(M1 &M2) \u22b8 EiN2) \u22a2 EiN1 Et(refl)\nEiM1 & EiM2,Et((Ei(M1 &M2) \u22b8 EiN1) & (Ei(M1 &M2) \u22b8 EiN2)) \u22a2 EiN1\nIn a similar way, we can represent functions of artefacts that require any number of actions and of agents to achieve a goal (of course, if we want to express that any subsets of A can operate the tool, then we need an exponentially long formula)."}, {"heading": "7.6 Function warranty and reuse of artefacts", "text": "RSBIAT is resource-sensitive as the non-provable sequent in our screwdriver example illustrated (Sec. 7.3)\nS, S,EiF,EjF,Es(S \u2297 F \u22b8 T ) 6\u22a2 T \u2297 T\nThe screwdriver cannot be reused, despite the fact that an additional screw is available and an appropriate force is brought about. This is perfectly fine as long as our interpretation of resource consumption is concurrent : all resources are consumed at once. And indeed, one cannot tighten two screws at once with only one screwdriver.\nAbandoning a concurrent interpretation of resource consumption, we may specialise the modality Ea when a is an artefactual agent in such a way that the function of an artefact can be used at will. After all, using a screwdriver once does not destroy the screwdriver. Its function is still present after. We are after a property of contraction for our operator Es.\n\u0393,EsA,EsA \u22a2 B c(Es)\n\u0393,EsA \u22a2 B\nNow, if we adopt the rule, c(Es) we can easily see that indeed\nS, S,EiF,EjF,Es(S \u2297 F \u22b8 T ) \u22a2 T \u2297 T\nis provable. There are several issues with this solution to \u2018reuse\u2019 as a duplication of assumptions. Some technical, some conceptual. The main technical issue is that we lose a lot of control on the proof search, as contraction is the main source of non-termination (of bottom-up proof search). Another technical (or theoretical) issue is that trying to give a natural condition on our frames that would be canonical for contraction is out of question. The conceptual issue is the same as the one posed by Girard in creating Linear Logic: duplication of assumptions should not be automatic. Similarly, ad lib reuse of an artefact does not reflect a commonsensical experience. In general, although they don\u2019t consume after the first use, tools will nonetheless eventually become so worn out that they will not realise their original function.\nWe can capitalise on the \u2018additive\u2019 feature of Linear Logic language: employing the \u2018with\u2019 operator &, we can specify a sort of warranty of artefact functions. Denote An = A\u2299 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2299A, for n times. We present the treatment by focusing on our example of screwdriver. A sequentially reusable screwdriver is defined as follows:\n(S \u2299 F \\ T )\u2264n = (S \u2299 F \\ T ) & (S2 \u2299 F 2 \\ T 2) & \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7& (Sn \u2299 Fn \\ T n)\nFor example, with three screws, and three agents (a, b, and c) providing the appropriate force, then using a decently robust screwdriver, one can obtain three tighten screws. We have:\nS, S, S,EaF,EbF,EcF,Es\u2022((S \u2299 F \\ T ) \u226410000 ) \u22a2 T \u2299 T \u2299 T\nwhere s\u2022 is our \u201cnon-commutative\u201d screwdriver, now with a ten thousand-use warranty.\nS \u22a2 S S \u22a2 S S;S \u22a2 S \u2299 S S \u22a2 S\nS;S;S \u22a2 S \u2299 S \u2299 S\nEaF \u22a2 F EbF \u22a2 F EaF ;EbF \u22a2 EaF \u2299 EbF EcF \u22a2 F\nEaF ;EbF ;EcF \u22a2 F \u2299 F \u2299 F\nS;S;S;EaF ;EbF ;EcF \u22a2 S \u2299 S \u2299 S \u2299 F \u2299 F \u2299 F T 3 \u22a2 T 3\nS;S;S;EaF ;EbF ;EcF ;S 3 \u2299 F 3 \\ T 3 \u22a2 T 3\n&L S;S;S;EaF ;EbF ;EcF ; (S \u2299 F \\ T )\n\u226410000 \u22a2 T 3 Es(re)\nS;S;S;EaF ;EbF ;EcF ;Es((S \u2299 F \\ T ) \u226410000) \u22a2 T 3\nNote that, the goal T \u2297 T \u2297 T is not provable, and this reflects our view of reusability as a sequential operation.\nBy pushing this analogy of warranty of artefact functions further on, we can model a \u201crefurbishing\u201d function that augments the warranty of the function A of a tool t. For instance, consider the refurbishing function which at the cost of consuming a resource R, transforms a worn out (but not too much worn out!)\nscrewdriver t into a screwdriver t with a function with extended warranty. It can be written as:\nR\u2297 Es((S \u2299 F \\ T ) \u226450 ) \u22b8 Es((S \u2299 F \\ T ) \u22647000 )\nand is for example a function that a bench grinder would have."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "The semantics of all the languages studied in this paper are adequate extensions of Urquhart\u2019s Kripke resource models for intuitionistic substructural logic. We first enriched the Kripke resource models with a neighbourhood function to give a meaning to a minimal (non-normal) modality. We obtained what we simply coin modal Kripke resource models. We thus defined and studied a minimal non-normal modal logic. The non-normal minimal modality is defined in the usual way where A holds at a point of evaluation iff the extension of A is in the neighbourhood of the point of evaluation. With Condition 1 on the models we enforced a sort of heredity (or monotonicity) on the neighbourhood function, without which the logic would not even validate modus ponens.\nWe introduced a Hilbert system and a sequent calculus. We showed that both are sound and complete with respect to the class of modal Kripke resource models. Moreover, we showed that the sequent calculus allows cut elimination. We used this fact to establish that proof search can be done in PSPACE. The soundness and completeness of the sequent calculus, and the cut-elimination show that the rule (re)\nA \u22a2 B B \u22a2 A A \u22a2 B\nwhich is atypical in a sequent calculus, yields the expected results and presents no logical issue. Moreover, the new semantics and calculi are general enough to extend the framework, as we did, to account for partially commutative Linear Logic.\nThe significance of non-normal modal logics and their semantics in modern developments in logics of agents has been emphasised before in the literature. In classical logic, logics of agency in particular, have been widely studied and used in practical philosophy and in multi-agent systems. Moving from classical logic to resource-sensitive logics allows to lift the study of agents bringing about states of affairs to the study of agents bringing about resources, or of artefacts bringing about resource transformations.\nWe thus instantiated the minimal modal logics (commutative / and partially commutative) with a resource-sensitive version of the logics of bringing-it-about. Again, sound and complete Hilbert system and sequent calculus are provided. Proof-search in the commutative version is shown to be PSPACE-easy. We finally presented a number of applications of the resulting resource-conscious logics of agency to reason about the resource-sensitive manipulations of technical artefacts."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Porello was supported by the VisCoSo project, financed by the Autonomous Province of Trento (\u201cTeam 2011\u201d funding programme).

We concentrate on extensions of variants of Linear Logic with one minimal non-normal modality. In earlier work, where we investigated agency in multi-agent systems, we have shown that the results scale up to logics with multiple non-minimal modalities. Here, we start with the language of propositional intuitionistic Linear Logic without the additive disjunction, to which we add a modality. We provide an interpretation of this language on a class of Kripke resource models extended with a neighbourhood function: modal Kripke resource models. We propose a Hilbert-style axiomatization and a Gentzen-style sequent calculus. We show that the proof theories are sound and complete with respect to the class of modal Kripke resource models. We show that the sequent calculus allows cut elimination and that proof-search is in PSPACE. We then show how to extend the results when non-commutative connectives are added to the language. Finally, we put the logical framework to use by instantiating it as logics of agency. In particular, we propose a logic to reason about the resource-sensitive use of artefacts and illustrate it with a variety of examples.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
