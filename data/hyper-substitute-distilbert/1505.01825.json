\u00a0a \u00a0transformation \u00a0of \u00a0a \u00a0class \u00a0of \u00a0non-\u2010Gaussian \u00a0univariate \u00a0 distributions \u00a0 into \u00a0 Gaussian \u00a0 distributions. \u00a0  \u00a0 Liu \u00a0 and \u00a0 collaborators \u00a0 (2012) \u00a0 subsequently \u00a0 applied \u00a0 the \u00a0 transform \u00a0 to \u00a0 search \u00a0 for \u00a0 graphical \u00a0 causal \u00a0 models \u00a0 for \u00a0 a \u00a0 number \u00a0 of \u00a0 empirical \u00a0 data \u00a0 sets. \u00a0 To \u00a0 our \u00a0 knowledge, \u00a0 there \u00a0 has \u00a0 been \u00a0 no \u00a0 published \u00a0 investigation

\u00a0 search \u00a0 procedures. \u00a0 We \u00a0 consider \u00a0 here \u00a0 how \u00a0 the \u00a0 transform \u00a0 affects \u00a0 the \u00a0 performance \u00a0 of \u00a0 two \u00a0 search \u00a0 algorithms \u00a0 in \u00a0 particular, \u00a0 PC \u00a0 (Spirtes \u00a0et \u00a0al., \u00a02000; \u00a0Meek \u00a01995) \u00a0and \u00a0GES \u00a0(Meek \u00a01997; \u00a0Chickering \u00a02002). \u00a0  \u00a0We \u00a0find \u00a0 that \u00a0 the \u00a0 transform \u00a0 is \u00a0harmless \u00a0but \u00a0 ineffective \u00a0 for \u00a0most \u00a0cases \u00a0but \u00a0quite \u00a0effective \u00a0 in \u00a0 very \u00a0 special \u00a0 cases \u00a0 for \u00a0 GES, \u00a0 namely, \u00a0 for \u00a0 moderate \u00a0 non-\u2010Gaussianity \u00a0 and \u00a0 moderate \u00a0 non-\u2010linearity. \u00a0For \u00a0strong-\u2010linearity, \u00a0another \u00a0algorithm, \u00a0PC-\u2010GES \u00a0(a \u00a0combination \u00a0of \u00a0PC \u00a0 with \u00a0GES), \u00a0is \u00a0equally \u00a0effective. \u00a0  \u00a0 The \u00a0 transform \u00a0 takes \u00a0 a \u00a0 column \u00a0 of \u00a0 data \u00a0 whose \u00a0 distribution \u00a0 is \u00a0 a \u00a0 smooth \u00a0monotone \u00a0 function \u00a0of \u00a0N(0, \u00a01) \u00a0and \u00a0renders \u00a0it \u00a0(using \u00a0order \u00a0statistics) \u00a0as \u00a0N(m, \u00a0s2) \u00a0where \u00a0m \u00a0is \u00a0the \u00a0 mean \u00a0of \u00a0 the \u00a0data \u00a0and \u00a0s2 \u00a0 is \u00a0 the \u00a0variance \u00a0of \u00a0 the \u00a0data, \u00a0possibly \u00a0with \u00a0standardization. \u00a0 There \u00a0are \u00a0 three \u00a0questions. \u00a0First, \u00a0how \u00a0does \u00a0 this \u00a0 transform \u00a0affect \u00a0data \u00a0 that \u00a0 is \u00a0 linear \u00a0 and \u00a0 Gaussian? \u00a0 Second, \u00a0 how \u00a0 does \u00a0 the \u00a0 transform \u00a0 affect \u00a0 analyses \u00a0 for \u00a0 data \u00a0 that \u00a0 are \u00a0\n \u00a0 2 \u00a0\nwithin \u00a0 the \u00a0 Gaussian \u00a0 copula? \u00a0 Third, \u00a0 how \u00a0does \u00a0 the \u00a0 transform \u00a0 affect \u00a0 data \u00a0 not \u00a0 in \u00a0 the \u00a0 Gaussian \u00a0 copula? \u00a0Applied \u00a0 to \u00a0 an \u00a0 arbitrary \u00a0 data \u00a0 set, \u00a0which \u00a0 does \u00a0 not \u00a0 necessarily \u00a0 fall \u00a0 within \u00a0 the \u00a0 theoretical \u00a0 purview \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 transform, \u00a0 how \u00a0 bad \u00a0 might \u00a0 one \u00a0 expect \u00a0 the \u00a0 performance \u00a0to \u00a0be? \u00a0  \u00a0 We \u00a0 address \u00a0 these \u00a0 questions \u00a0 by \u00a0 looking \u00a0 at \u00a0 data \u00a0 generated \u00a0 under \u00a0 various \u00a0 assumptions, \u00a0running \u00a0PC \u00a0and \u00a0GES \u00a0on \u00a0these \u00a0data, \u00a0and \u00a0checking \u00a0the \u00a0adequacy \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0 resulting \u00a0models. \u00a0We \u00a0report \u00a0just \u00a0four \u00a0statistics. \u00a0Given \u00a0data \u00a0set \u00a0D, \u00a0generated \u00a0by \u00a0graph \u00a0 G,

\u00a0graph \u00a0H, \u00a0we \u00a0will \u00a0assess \u00a0(1) \u00a0the \u00a0rate \u00a0of \u00a0false \u00a0positive \u00a0adjacencies \u00a0(that \u00a0 it, \u00a0the \u00a0number \u00a0of

\u00a0divided \u00a0by \u00a0the \u00a0number \u00a0of \u00a0arrow \u00a0points \u00a0in \u00a0P); \u00a0 and \u00a0(4) \u00a0the \u00a0arrow \u00a0recovery \u00a0rate \u00a0(that \u00a0is, \u00a0the

\u00a0various \u00a0searches \u00a0based \u00a0on \u00a0these \u00a0 statistics. \u00a0  \u00a0 We \u00a0consider \u00a0various \u00a0versions \u00a0of \u00a0each \u00a0algorithm. \u00a0First \u00a0of \u00a0all, \u00a0we \u00a0consider \u00a0either \u00a0using \u00a0 the \u00a0 standard \u00a0 covariance \u00a0matrix \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 data \u00a0 as \u00a0 input \u00a0 to \u00a0 each

\u00a0as \u00a0 input \u00a0 to \u00a0 each \u00a0algorithm. \u00a0We \u00a0denote \u00a0by \u00a0\"PC-\u2010S\" \u00a0PC \u00a0(Spirtes \u00a0et \u00a0al., \u00a02000; \u00a0Meek \u00a01995) \u00a0taking \u00a0the \u00a0 standard \u00a0covariance \u00a0matrix \u00a0as \u00a0input \u00a0and \u00a0by \u00a0\"PC-\u2010L\" \u00a0PC \u00a0taking \u00a0the \u00a0covariance \u00a0matrix \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 Liu \u00a0 et \u00a0 al. \u00a0 transformed \u00a0 data \u00a0 as \u00a0 input. \u00a0 For \u00a0 PC \u00a0 we \u00a0 use \u00a0 a \u00a0 significance \u00a0 level \u00a0 of \u00a0 0.001. \u00a0 For \u00a0 GES \u00a0 (Chickering, \u00a0 2002), \u00a0 because \u00a0 it \u00a0 is \u00a0 illustrative, \u00a0 we \u00a0 consider \u00a0 two \u00a0 different \u00a0 scores, \u00a0 AIC \u00a0 and \u00a0 BIC. \u00a0 Thus, \u00a0we \u00a0 denote \u00a0 by \u00a0 \"GES-\u2010AIC-\u2010S\" \u00a0 GES \u00a0 using \u00a0 the \u00a0 AIC \u00a0 score \u00a0taking \u00a0the

\u00a0\"GES-\u2010BIC-\u2010S\" \u00a0and \u00a0\"GES-\u2010BIC-\u2010L\". \u00a0Because \u00a0it \u00a0is \u00a0of \u00a0interest, \u00a0we \u00a0 also \u00a0 show \u00a0 the \u00a0 result \u00a0 of \u00a0 running \u00a0 PC-\u2010S \u00a0 on \u00a0 the \u00a0 standard \u00a0 covariance \u00a0 matrix \u00a0 to \u00a0 get \u00a0 adjacencies \u00a0 and \u00a0 then \u00a0 running \u00a0

\u00a0 this \u00a0 is \u00a0an \u00a0amiable \u00a0configuration. \u00a0 We \u00a0denote \u00a0this \u00a0configuration \u00a0as \u00a0\"PC-\u2010GES\" \u00a0in \u00a0the \u00a0tables. \u00a0  \u00a0 We \u00a0 are \u00a0 interested \u00a0 in \u00a0 two \u00a0 dimensions \u00a0 of \u00a0 variation \u00a0 in \u00a0 models: \u00a0 distribution \u00a0 of \u00a0 disturbances, \u00a0 and \u00a0 linearity \u00a0 of \u00a0 connection \u00a0 functions. \u00a0 In \u00a0 all \u00a0 cases, \u00a0 we \u00a0 will \u00a0 consider \u00a0 directed \u00a0acyclic \u00a0models, \u00a0since \u00a0these \u00a0fit \u00a0under \u00a0the \u00a0assumptions \u00a0of \u00a0PC \u00a0and \u00a0GES. \u00a0 \u00a0In \u00a0all \u00a0 cases, \u00a0 we \u00a0 are \u00a0 interested \u00a0 in \u00a0 structural

\u00a0:= \u00a0eX \u00a0 Y \u00a0:= \u00a0f(X) \u00a0+ \u00a0eY \u00a0  \u00a0 where \u00a0 X \u00a0 and \u00a0 Y \u00a0 are \u00a0 continuous \u00a0 variables, \u00a0 f \u00a0 is \u00a0 a \u00a0 function, \u00a0 and \u00a0 eX \u00a0 and \u00a0 eY \u00a0 are \u00a0 disturbances. \u00a0 In \u00a0 this \u00a0 case, \u00a0 the \u00a0 only \u00a0 sources \u00a0 of \u00a0 random \u00a0 variation

\u00a0\n(i.i.d.). \u00a0We \u00a0may \u00a0represent \u00a0the \u00a0above \u00a0structural \u00a0equation \u00a0model \u00a0as \u00a0eX-\u2010>X-\u2010>Y<-\u2010eY \u00a0and \u00a0 we \u00a0 may

\u00a0 disturbances \u00a0 may \u00a0 be \u00a0 distributed \u00a0 in \u00a0 any \u00a0 of \u00a0 a \u00a0 number \u00a0 of \u00a0 ways, \u00a0 and \u00a0 their \u00a0 distribution \u00a0 affects
