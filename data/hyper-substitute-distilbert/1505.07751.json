Belief function theories (e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, Transferable Belief Model) have been shown to provide a reasonable methodology for processing or fusing the quantitative clues or information measurements that form the incomplete information set.\nFor decision making, a pignistic probability transform has been shown to be a good method of using Beliefs or BBAs to make decisions. For some critical systems, one must evaluate the risk of wrong decisions and establish safe probability thresholds for decision making. This adds a greater complexity to decision making, since one must address all elements in the set that are above the risk decision threshold.\nFour new operators have been introduced to simplify derivations, the union-to-sum operator, the sum-to-union operator, compound-to-sum operator, and the sum-tocompound operator.\nThis article introduced four new pignistic probability transforms that may be used to make decisions depending on the maturity of the incomplete information set. The probability information content (PIC) variable was also\nintroduced in this article that can be used to evaluate the various pignistic probability transforms. Some of these transforms assign smaller values of probabilities for smaller values of Beliefs or BBAs than Smets pignistic transform. They also assign higher probability values for larger values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets pignistic transform. These probability transforms will assign a value of probability that converges faster to the values below the risk threshold. A rationale for their construct was also given.\nThe PIC variable has been shown to have the correct limits. A PIC value of one indicates total knowledge is available and there is no ambiguity in the decision making. (i.e., one of the hypotheses has a probability value of one and the rest have zero.) A PIC value of zero indicates that all the hypothesis have an equal probability of occurring and it is impossible to make a good decision with the probability distribution that is available.\nThis article outlines a systematic methodology of making better decisions using Belief function theories. This methodology can be used to automate critical decisions in complex systems.\nReferences: E.A.

Belief function theories (e.g., DempsterShafer theory of evidence, Transferable Belief Model) have been shown to provide a reasonable methodology for processing or fusing the quantitative clues or information measurements that form the incomplete information set. For decision making, the pignistic (from the Latin pignus, a bet) probability transform has been shown to be a good method of using Beliefs or basic belief assignments (BBAs) to make decisions. For many systems, one need only address the most-probable elements in the set. For some critical systems, one must evaluate the risk of wrong decisions and establish safe probability thresholds for decision making. This adds a greater complexity to decision making, since one must address all elements in the set that are above the risk decision threshold. The problem is greatly simplified if most of the probabilities fall below this threshold. Finding a probability transform that properly represents mixes of lowand high-probability events is essential. This article introduces four new pignistic probability transforms with an implementation that uses the latest values of Beliefs, Plausibilities, or BBAs to improve the pignistic probability estimates. Some of them assign smaller values of probabilities for smaller values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets pignistic transform. They also assign higher probability values for larger values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets pignistic transform. These probability transforms will assign a value of probability that converges faster to the values below the risk threshold. A probability information content (PIC) variable is also introduced that assigns an information content value to any set of probability. Four operators are defined to help simplify the derivations. This article outlines a systematic methodology of making better decisions using Belief function theories. This methodology can be used to automate critical decisions in complex systems.", "creator": "Sudano.doc - Microsoft Word"}}}
