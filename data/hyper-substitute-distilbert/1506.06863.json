Tasks with intrinsically diverse targets range from machine translation, summarization, sentence compression, paraphrase generation, and image-to-text to generation of conversational interactions. A major hurdle for these tasks is automation of evaluation, since the space of plausible outputs can be enormous, and it is it impractical to run a new human evaluation every time a new model is built or parameters are modified.\nIn Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), the automation problem has to a large extent been ameliorated by metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) Although BLEU is not immune from criticism (e.g., Callison-Burch et al. (2006)), its properties are well\n\u2217To appear at ACL in July 2015 (submitted April 30, 2015, accepted June 9, 2015).\n\u2020Corresponding author: mgalley@microsoft.com \u2021The entirety of this work was conducted while at Mi-\ncrosoft Research.\nunderstood, BLEU scores have been shown to correlate well with human judgments (Doddington, 2002; Coughlin, 2003; Graham and Baldwin, 2014; Graham et al., 2015) in SMT, and it has allowed the field to proceed.\nBLEU has been less successfully applied to nonSMT generation tasks owing to the larger space of plausible outputs. As a result, attempts have been made to adapt the metric. To foster diversity in paraphrase generation, Sun and Zhou (2012) propose a metric called iBLEU in which the BLEU score is discounted by a BLEU score computed between the source and paraphrase. This solution, in addition to being dependent on a tunable parameter, is specific only to paraphrase. In image captioning tasks, Vendantam et al. (2015), employ a variant of BLEU in which n-grams are weighted by tf \u00b7idf. This assumes the availability of a corpus with which to compute tf \u00b7idf. Both the above can be seen as attempting to capture a notion of target goodness that is not being captured in BLEU.\nIn this paper, we introduce Discriminative BLEU (\u2206BLEU), a new metric that embeds human judgments concerning the quality of reference sentences directly into the computation of corpus-level multiple-reference BLEU. In effect, we push part of the burden of human evaluation into the automated metric, where it can be repeatedly utilized.\nOur testbed for this metric is data-driven conversation, a field that has begun to attract interest (Ritter et al., 2011; Sordoni et al., 2015) as an alternative to conventional rule-driven or scripted dialog systems. Intrinsic evaluation in this field is exceptionally challenging because the semantic space of possible responses resists definition and is only weakly constrained by conversational inputs.\nBelow, we describe \u2206BLEU and investigate its characteristics in comparison to standard BLEU in the context of conversational response generation.\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n06 86\n3v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 Ju\nn 20\n15\nWe demonstrate that \u2206BLEU correlates well with human evaluation scores in this task and thus can provide a basis for automated training and evaluation of data-driven conversation systems\u2014and, we ultimately believe, other text generation tasks with inherently diverse targets."}, {"heading": "2 Evaluating Conversational Responses", "text": "Given an input message m and a prior conversation history c, the goal of a response generation system is to produce a hypothesis h that is both well-formed and a pertinent response to message m (example in Fig. 1). We assume that a set of J references {ri,j} is available for the context ci and message mi, where i \u2208 {1 . . . I} is an index over the test set. In the case of BLEU,1 the automatic score of the system output h1 . . . hI is defined as:\nBLEU = BP \u00b7 exp (\u2211\nn\nlog pn\n) (1)\nwith:\nBP = { 1 if \u03b7 > \u03c1 e(1\u2212\u03c1/\u03b7) otherwise\n(2)\nwhere \u03c1 and \u03b7 are respectively hypothesis and reference lengths.2 Then corpus-level n-gram precision is defined as:\npn =\n\u2211 i \u2211 g \u2208n-grams(hi) maxj { #g(hi, ri,j) }\u2211 i \u2211 g \u2208n-grams(hi) #g(hi)\nwhere #g(\u00b7) is the number of occurrences of n-gram g in a given sentence, and #g(u, v) is a shorthand for min { #g(u),#g(v) } .\nIt has been demonstrated that metrics such as BLEU show increased correlation with human judgment as the number of references increases (Przybocki et al., 2008; Dreyer and Marcu, 2012). Unfortunately, gathering multiple references is difficult in the case of conversations. Data gathered from naturally occurring conversations offer only one response per message. One could search (c,m) pairs that occur multiple times in conversational\n1Unless mentioned otherwise, BLEU refers to the original IBM BLEU as first described in (Papineni et al., 2002).\n2In the case of multiple references, BLEU selects the reference whose length is closest to that of the hypothesis.\ndata with the hope of finding distinct responses, but this solution is not feasible. Indeed, the larger the context, the less likely we are to find pairs that match exactly. Furthermore, while it is feasible to have writers create additional references when the downstream task is relatively unambiguous (e.g., MT), this approach is more questionable in the case of more subjective tasks such as conversational response generation. Our solution is to mine candidate responses from conversational data and have judges rate the quality of these responses. Our new metric thus naturally incorporates qualitative weights associated with references.\n3 Discriminative BLEU\nDiscriminative BLEU, or \u2206BLEU, extends BLEU by exploiting human qualitative judgments wi,j \u2208 [\u22121,+1] associated with references ri,j . It is discriminative in that it both rewards matches with \u201cgood\u201d reference responses (w > 0) and penalizes matches with \u201cbad\u201d reference responses (w < 0). Formally, \u2206BLEU is defined as in Equation 1 and 2, except that pn is instead defined as:\u2211 i \u2211 g \u2208n-grams(hi) maxj:g \u2208 ri,j { wi,j \u00b7#g(hi, ri,j)\n}\u2211 i \u2211 g \u2208n-grams(hi) maxj { wi,j \u00b7#g(hi)\n} In a nutshell, this is saying that each n-gram match is weighted by the highest scoring reference in which it occurs, and this weight can sometimes be negative. To ensure that the denominator is never zero, we assume that, for each i there exists at least one reference ri,j whose weight wi,j is strictly positive. In addition to its discriminative nature, this metric has two interesting properties. First, if all weights wi,j are equal to 1, then the metric score is identical to BLEU. As such, \u2206BLEU admits BLEU as a special case. Second, as with IBM BLEU, the maximum theoretical score is also 1. If the hypothesis happens to match the highest weighted reference for each sentence, the numerator equals the denominator and the metric score becomes 1. While we find this metric particularly appropriate for response generation, the metric makes no assumption on the task and is applicable to other text generation tasks such as MT and image captioning."}, {"heading": "4 Data", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 Multi-reference Datasets", "text": "To create the multi-reference BLEU dev and test sets used in this study, we adapted and extended the\nmethodology of Sordoni et al. (2015). From a corpus of 29M Twitter context-message-response conversational triples, we randomly extracted approximately 33K candidate triples that were then judged for conversational quality on a 5-point Likert-type scale by 3 crowdsourced annotators. Of these, 4232 triples scored an average 4 or higher; these were randomly binned to create seed dev and test sets of 2118 triples and 2114 triples respectively. Note that the dev set is not used in the experiments of this paper, since \u2206BLEU and IBM BLEU are metrics that do not require training. However, the dev set is released along with a test set in the dataset release accompanying this paper.\nWe then sought to identify candidate triples in the 29M corpus for which both message and response are similar to the original messages and responses in these seed sets. To this end, we employed an information retrieval algorithm with a bag-of-words BM25 similarity function (Robertson et al., 1995), as detailed in Sordoni et al. (2015), to extract the top 15 responses for each messageresponse pair. Unlike Sordoni et al. (2015), we further appended the original messages (as if par-\nroted back). The new triples were then scored for quality of the response in light of both context and message by 5 crowdsourced raters each on a 5- point Likert-type scale.3 Crucially, and again in contradistinction to Sordoni et al. (2015), we did not impose a score cutoff on these synthetic multireference sets. Instead, we retained all candidate responses and scaled their scores into [\u22121, +1].\nTable 1 presents representative multi-reference examples (from the dev set) together with their converted scores. The context and messages associated with the supplementary mined responses are also shown for illustrative purposes to demonstrate the range of conversations from which they were taken. In the table, negative-weighted mined responses are semantically orthogonal to the intent of their newly assigned context and message. Strongly negatively weighted responses are completely out of the ballpark (\u201cthe weather in Russia is very cool\u201d, \u201cwell then! Why were the biscuits needed?\u201d); others are a little more plausible, but irrelevant or possibly topic\n3For this work, we sought 2 additional annotations of the seed responses for consistency with the mined responses. As a result, scores for some seed responses slipped below our initial threshold of 4. Nonetheless, these responses were retained.\nchanging (\u201cohh I love that song\u201d). Higher-valued positive-weighted mined responses are typically reasonably appropriate and relevant (even though extracted from a completely unrelated conversation), and in some cases can outscore the original response, as can be seen in the third set of examples."}, {"heading": "4.2 Human Evaluation of System Outputs", "text": "Responses generated by the 7 systems used in this study on the 2114-triple test set were hand evaluated by 5 crowdsourced raters each on a 5-point Likert-type scale. From these 7 systems, 12 system pairs were evaluated, for a total of about pairwise 126K ratings (12 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 2114). Here too, raters were asked to evaluate responses in terms of their relevance to both context and message. Outputs from different systems were randomly interleaved for presentation to the raters. We obtained human ratings on the following systems:\nPhrase-based MT: A phrase-based MT system similar to (Ritter et al., 2011), whose weights have been manually tuned. We also included four variants of that system, which we tuned with MERT (Och, 2003). These variants differ in their number of features, and augment (Ritter et al., 2011) with the following phrase-level features: edit distance between source and target, cosine similarity, Jaccard index and distance, length ratio, and DSSM score (Huang et al., 2013). RNN-based MT: the log-probability according to the RNN model of (Sordoni et al., 2015). Baseline: a random baseline.\nWhile \u2206BLEU relies on human qualitative judgments, it is important to note that human judgments on multi-references (\u00a7 4.1) and those on system outputs were collected completely independently. We also note that the set of systems listed above specifically does not include a retrieval-based model, as this might have introduced spurious correlation between the two datasets (\u00a7 4.1 and \u00a7 4.2)."}, {"heading": "5 Setup", "text": "We use two rank correlation coefficients\u2014 Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 and Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u2014to assess the level of correlation between human qualitative ratings (\u00a74.2) and automated metric scores. More formally, we compute each correlation coefficient on a series of paired observations (m1, q1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (mN , qN ). Here,mi and qi are respectively differences in automatic metric scores and qualitative ratings for two\ngiven systems A and B on a given subset of the test set.4While much prior work assesses automatic metrics for MT and other tasks (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007; Hodosh et al., 2013) by computing correlations on observations consisting of single-sentence system outputs, it has been shown (e.g., Przybocki et al. (2008)) that correlation coefficients significantly increase as observation units become larger. For instance, corpus-level or system-level correlations tend to be much higher than sentence-level correlations; Graham and Baldwin (2014) show that BLEU is competitive with more recent and advanced metrics when assessed at the system level.5\nTherefore, we define our observation unit size to be M = 100 sentences (responses),6 unless stated otherwise. We evaluate qi by averaging human ratings on the M sentences, and mi by computing metric scores on the same set of sentences.7 We compare three different metrics: BLEU, \u2206BLEU, and sentence-level BLEU (sBLEU). The last computes sentence-level BLEU scores (Nakov et al., 2012) and averages them on the M sentences (akin to macro-averaging). Finally, unless otherwise noted, all versions of BLEU use n-gram order up to 2 (BLEU-2), as this achieves better correlation for all metrics on this data."}, {"heading": "6 Results", "text": "The main results of our study are shown in Table 2. \u2206BLEU achieves better correlation with human than BLEU, when comparing the best configuration of each metric.8 In the case of Spearman\u2019s \u03c1,\n4For each given observation pair (mi, qi), we randomize the order in which A and B are presented to the raters in order to avoid any positional bias.\n5We do not intend to minimize the benefit of a metric that would be competitive at the sentence-level, which would be particularly useful for detailed error analyses. However, our main goal is to reliably evaluate generation systems on test sets of thousands of sentences, in which case any metric with good corpus-level correlation (such as BLEU, as shown in (Graham and Baldwin, 2014)) would be sufficient.\n6Enumerating all possible ways of assigning sentences to observations would cause a combinatorial explosion. Instead, for all our results we sample 1K assignments and average correlations coefficients over them (using the same 1K assignments across all metrics). These assignments are done in such a way that all sentences within an observation belong to the same system pair.\n7We refrained from using larger units, as creating larger observation unitsM reduces the total number of unitsN . This would have caused confidence intervals to be so wide as to make this study inconclusive.\n8This is also the case on single reference. While \u2206BLEU and BLEU would have the same correlation if original references all had the same score of 1, it is not unusual for original references to get ratings below 1.\nthe confidence intervals of BLEU (.265, .416) and \u2206BLEU (.415, .546) barely overlap, while interval overlap is more significant in the case of Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 . Correlation coefficients degrade for BLEU as we go from w \u2265 0.6 to using all references. This is expected, since BLEU treats all references as equal and has no way of discriminating between them. On the other hand, correlation coefficients increase for \u2206BLEU after adding lower scoring references. It is also worth noticing that BLEU and sBLEU obtain roughly comparable correlation coefficients. This may come as a surprise, because it has been suggested elsewhere that sBLEU has much worse correlation than BLEU computed at the corpus level (Przybocki et al., 2008). We surmise that (at least for this task and data) the differences in correlations between BLEU and sBLEU observed in prior work may be less the result of a difference between micro- and macro-averaging than they are the effect of different observation unit sizes (as discussed in \u00a75).\nFinally, Figure 2 shows how Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 is affected along three dimensions of study. In particular, we see that \u2206BLEU actually benefits from the references with negative ratings. While the improvement is not pronounced, we note that most references have positive ratings. Negatively-weighted references could have a greater effect if, for example, randomly extracted responses had also been annotated."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "\u2206BLEU correlates well with human quality judgments of generated conversational responses, outperforming both IBM BLEU and sentence-level BLEU in this task and demonstrating that it can serve as a plausible intrinsic metric for system de-\nvelopment.9 An upfront cost is paid for human evaluation of the reference set, but following that, the need for further human evaluation can be minimized during system development. \u2206BLEU may help other tasks that use multiple references for intrinsic evaluation, including image-to-text, sentence compression, and paraphrase generation, and even statistical machine translation.
