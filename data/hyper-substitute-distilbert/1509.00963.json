Introduction", "text": "Temporal expressions in natural language texts stand as one of the crucial pieces of information to be extracted from these texts. Accordingly, several text analysis applications, like event extractors (Ritter et al., 2012) and text-based video annotation systems (Ku\u0308c\u0327u\u0308k and Yaz\u0131c\u0131, 2011), include a temporal expression extractor as a submodule to identify, normalize and then make use of these expressions.\nTraditionally, temporal expressions like some date and time expressions have been considered as named entities and have been included in the scope of named entity recognition (NER) systems. For instance, in the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) series (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), which have been conducted for several years to promote research in information extraction, some date and time expressions were considered within the scope of the NER task and, in the related guidelines, these expressions are recommended to be annotated with the TIMEX tag. But within the scope of MUC, only the identification of these temporal expressions was required without the need for their normalization.\nTimeML is a standard markup language for annotating temporal expressions and events (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a) which is built upon previous work on the annotation of temporal expressions such as (Ferro et al., 2001; Setzer, 2001). According to the current TimeML guideline (Saur\u0131\u0301 et al., 2005), TIMEX3 tag is used to annotate the temporal expressions identified and the normalized forms of the expressions are also specified within the annotations. Additionally, SIGNAL tag is used to annotate the temporal relations between two temporal expressions, two events, or a temporal expression and an event. There are mainly four distinct temporal expressions within the scope of TimeML: date, time, set, and duration (Saur\u0131\u0301 et al., 2005). Hence, the extent of the temporal expressions considered in TimeML is also broader compared to the extent considered in the MUC series, in addition to the normalization procedure introduced.\nThere are several temporal expression extraction and normalization systems, as reported in studies like (UzZaman et al., 2013). One of the initial such systems is called GUTime which is the temporal expression recognition and normalization module of a larger system called TARSQI which annotates temporal expressions, relations, and events in news texts (Verhagen et al., 2005). Several of the system proposals so far, including Edinburgh-LTG (Grover et al., 2010), HeidelTime (Stro\u0308tgen and Gertz, 2010), SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2013), and FSS-TimEx (Zavarella and Tanev, 2013) are rule-based systems and some of them, such as HeidelTime, have been extended to extract temporal expressions in other languages including Arabic, Italian, Spanish, and Vietnamese (Stro\u0308tgen et al., 2014). As previously pointed out, the extraction of some temporal expressions has long been considered a subtask of named entity recognition, and accordingly, some of the aforementioned systems like Edinburgh-LTG and SUTime are based on previous\nNER systems.\nIn addition to the system proposals, as there is a need for corpora annotated with temporal expressions, relations, and events, resources like TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b) have emerged. TimeBank has been commonly used to evaluate and compare different system proposals. Similar annotated resources have also been constructed for other languages, such as French TimeBank (Bittar et al., 2011), Spanish TimeBank (Saur\u0131\u0301 and Badia, 2012), and Italian Timebank (Caselli et al., 2011). Such resources are indispensable for training the extraction systems proposed in addition to the common evaluation and thereby comparison of different system proposals, and to the best of our knowledge, no such annotated resource exists for Turkish.\nConsidering the related tools on Turkish, extraction of date and time expressions has been performed by the rule-based NER system (Ku\u0308c\u0327u\u0308k and Yaz\u0131c\u0131, 2009) and its extended versions like (Ku\u0308c\u0327u\u0308k and Yaz\u0131c\u0131, 2012), mostly following the named entity definition of the MUC series and extracting some deictic date expressions as well, without normalization. These experiments have been performed on diverse text genres such as news articles, historical texts, and child stories. Within a text-based semantic video annotation system, which makes use of this NER system, a separate date normalization module has been implemented to normalize only the deictic date expressions using the creation dates of the corresponding videos as reference dates (Ku\u0308c\u0327u\u0308k and Yaz\u0131c\u0131, 2011). Within the course of this latter study, extraction experiments are performed on automatically obtained news video texts which are mostly noisy (due to the character recognition errors introduced during the sliding text recognition procedure employed). Recently, date and time expressions are also recognized in informal texts (i.e., tweets) in Turkish using the aforementioned rule-based system, as described in (Ku\u0308c\u0327u\u0308k and Steinberger, 2014). Another related work is presented in (S\u0327eker and Diri, 2010), where the authors have considered temporal logic and event times in Turkish based on existing temporal models, yet, it does not aim to propose a temporal expression extractor or related resource for Turkish.\nIn this paper, we provide an analysis of the temporal expressions in Turkish, following the corresponding TimeML classification. We mainly provide several wide-coverage patterns for the extraction of these expressions together with sample expressions and their annotated forms with the TIMEX3 tag. With the presented lexicon, pattern bases, and the review of the related limited literature on Turkish, we believe that this paper can be used as a guideline before building a temporal expression extraction and normalization system for Turkish. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, a compact temporal lexicon in Turkish and patterns for the extraction of temporal expressions in Turkish are presented together with several samples. Section 3 lists the open issues on temporal expression extraction and normalization in Turkish texts and Section 4 concludes the paper."}, {"heading": "2. Temporal Expressions in Turkish", "text": "Before presenting the lexical resources and patterns for temporal expressions in Turkish, we briefly summarize their two particularities in formal Turkish texts which should also be considered during system development. These writing rules are provided below, following the corresponding language rules published by Tu\u0308rk Dil Kurumu (\u2018Turkish Language Association\u2019) (TDK, 2015):\n\u2022 The tokens within temporal expressions are all in lowercase, except the names of the months and week days which have their initial letters capitalized. Sample expressions are bugu\u0308n (\u2018today\u2019), yar\u0131ndan sonraki gu\u0308n (\u2018the day after tomorrow\u2019), Pazartesi sabah\u0131 (\u2018Monday morning\u2019), May\u0131s ay\u0131n\u0131n ikinci Pazar gu\u0308nu\u0308 (\u2018the second Sunday of (the month of) May\u2019).\n\u2022 The suffixes attached at the ends of the tokens of the temporal expressions are not separated from the attached suffixes. The names of the months and week days and numerals constitute the exceptions of this characteristic, as the sequence of suffixes added to the ends of these are separated from them with apostrophes. In the illustrative temporal expression, 2015 y\u0131l\u0131n\u0131n Mart\u2019\u0131n\u0131n 23\u2019u\u0308 (\u2018the 23rd of March of (the year of) 2015\u2019), the sequence of suffixes attached at the end of y\u0131l (\u2018year\u2019) is not separated from it while the ones attached at the ends of the numeral (23) and Mart (\u2018March\u2019) are separated with apostrophes.\nAs mentioned in Section 1, there are four distinct types of temporal expressions within the scope of TimeML: date, time, set, and duration, which correspond to the value range of the type attribute of the TIMEX3 tag. In this section, we first provide a compact temporal lexicon for Turkish and in the following subsections, we present patterns for temporal expressions in Turkish and then samples conforming to these patterns.\nWe should note that both the lexicon and the pattern bases are nowhere near exhaustive. We have tried to devise patterns with high coverage as much as we can, yet, they are all open to modifications, corrections, and extensions especially when building practical systems for Turkish. Normalization is also not considered within the current study, a distinct set of normalization rules should be devised for the extracted temporal expressions as part of the future work."}, {"heading": "2.1. Turkish Lexicon for Temporal Expressions", "text": "We have built the Turkish lexicon for temporal expressions with the following lexical classes.

Date Expressions", "text": "Before presenting the actual patterns for date expressions (<DATE-EXPR>), we first present patterns for auxiliary constructs of <DAY-EXPR>, <MON-EXPR>, and <YEAR-EXPR> which are in turn used within the <DATE-EXPR> patterns. The patterns are presented as regular expressions where ? denotes zero or one, * denotes zero or more, | denotes the OR operator and parentheses are for grouping purposes. The patterns may include both the classes of lexical entries, described in the previous section, and rarely individual entries themselves, like y\u0131l (\u2018year\u2019), sene (\u2018year\u2019), ay (\u2018month\u2019), gu\u0308n (\u2018day\u2019), and saat (\u2018hour\u2019).\nThough not denoted in the patterns, there are also constraints, regarding the lexical entries, that should be enforced during the utilization of the patterns.

Open Issues", "text": "The open issues on temporal expression extraction from Turkish texts include the following:\n\u2022 The development of temporal expression extraction and normalization systems is an important open issue for Turkish. A convenient system can be achieved by (i) building a rule-based/learning system from scratch, or by (ii) extending an already existing and open-source temporal expression extractor, like HeidelTime (Stro\u0308tgen and Gertz, 2010) or SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2013), to Turkish, or by (iii) extending an already existing Turkish NER system recognizing date and time expressions, like (Ku\u0308c\u0327u\u0308k and Yaz\u0131c\u0131, 2009), to make it a full-fledged temporal expression extractor. Deeper examinations of these tools are definitely necessary to assess the feasibility of each option, yet, the second and the third options currently seem less labor-intensive compared to the first one.\n\u2022 Due to the agglutinative nature of Turkish, the tokens within the temporal expressions can have sequences of suffixes attached, as demonstrated in the proposed patterns given in the previous section. So, a convenient morphological analyzer should be considered for inclusion into the prospective systems.\n\u2022 In order to train and test the prospective temporal expression extraction and normalization proposals for Turkish, conveniently annotated corpora in Turkish are necessary. To the best of our knowledge, no such resource, in other words, no Turkish Timebank exists currently. Actually, this lack of annotated corpora is an issue even for the more commonly studied problem of NER on Turkish texts. The only study that describes a publicly-available Turkish corpus (of tweets) annotated with the MUC-style basic named entity types (person, location, and organization names, money and percentage expressions, along with date and time expressions) is presented in (Ku\u0308c\u0327u\u0308k et al., 2014). This annotated resource can be used as a starting point to build a Turkish Timebank, though it should be noted that no normalization information exists for the annotated date and time expressions in the current form of the resource.\n\u2022 After the developments to be carried out within the course of the previous two items above, temporal signals (to be annotated with the SIGNAL tag) and events can be included within the scopes of the system proposals to fully comply with the TimeML specifications. Thereby, a full-fledged temporal expression and event extraction system can be achieved for Turkish."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusion", "text": "Temporal expression extraction is an important information extraction task and the corresponding extraction tools make significant contributions to larger natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we present a TimeML-based analysis of temporal expressions in Turkish as related studies on Turkish texts are quite rare. We first describe a temporal lexicon and then use the classes in the lexicon as the building blocks to devise a total of 17 wide-coverage patterns for the extraction of date, time, set, and duration expressions in Turkish. We also provide samples of temporal expressions in Turkish along with the related open issues."}, {"heading": "5.

As TimeML is the current standard of temporal expression and event annotation in natural language texts, in this paper, we present an analysis of temporal expressions in Turkish based on the related TimeML classification (i.e., date, time, duration, and set expressions). We have created a lexicon for Turkish temporal expressions and devised considerably wide-coverage patterns using the lexical classes as the building blocks. We believe that the proposed patterns, together with convenient normalization rules, can be readily used by prospective temporal expression extraction tools for Turkish.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
