In the last two years, over ten billion of emojis were used on Twitter. Emojis are Unicode graphic symbols, used as a shorthand to express concepts and ideas. In contrast to a small number of well-known emoticons which carry clear emotional contents, there are hundreds of emojis. But what is their emotional contents? We provide the first emoji sentiment lexicon, called Emoji Sentiment Ranking, and draw a sentiment map of the 751 most frequently used emojis. The sentiment of emojis is computed from the sentiment of tweets in which they occur. We have engaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European languages by the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive). About 4% of the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of emojis yields several interesting conclusions. It turns out that most of the emojis are positive, especially the most popular ones. The sentiment distribution of the tweets with and without emojis is significantly different. The inter-annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend to occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with the distance. We observe no significant differences in emoji rankings between the 13 languages, and propose our Emoji Sentiment Ranking as a European language-independent resource for automated sentiment analysis.

It allows the author to express her/his feelings, mood and emotions, and augments a written message with non-verbal elements. It helps in drawing the readers attention, and enhances and improves the understanding of the message. An emoji is a step further, developed with modern communication technologies that facilitate more expressive messages. An emoji is a graphic symbol, ideogram, that represents not only facial expressions, but also concepts and ideas, such as celebration, weather, vehicles and buildings, food and drink, animals and plants, or emotions, feelings, and activities.\nEmojis on smartphones, in chat, and email applications have become extremely popular worldwide. For example, Instagram, an online mobile photo-sharing, video-sharing and social networking platform, reported in March 2015 that nearly half of the texts on Instagram contained emojis [1]. The use of emojis on the SwiftKey Android and iOS keybords, for devices such as smartphones and tablets, was analyzed in the SwiftKey Emoji Report [2], where a great variety in popularity of individual emojis and even between countries was reported. However, to the best of our knowledge, no large scale analysis of the emotional contents of emojis has been conducted so far.\nSentiment analysis is the field of study that analyzes people\u2019s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from text [3, 4]. In analyzing short informal texts, such as tweets, blogs or comments, it turned out that emoticons provide a crucial piece of information [5\u201312]. However, emojis\nhave so far not been exploited, and no resource with the emoji sentiment information has been provided.\nIn this paper, we present Emoji Sentiment Ranking, the first emoji sentiment lexicon of 751 emojis. The lexicon was constructed from over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European languages, annotated for sentiment by human annotators. In the corpus, probably the largest set of manually annotated tweets, 4% of the tweets contain emojis. The sentiment of emojis is computed from the sentiment of tweets in which they occur, and reflects the actual use of emojis in a context.\nBackground. An emoticon is a short sequence of characters, typically punctuation symbols. The use of emoticons can be traced back to the 19th century, when they were used in casual and humorous writing. The first use of emoticons in the digital era is attributed to professor Scott Fahlman, in a message on the computer science message board of Carnegie Mellon University, on September 19, 1982. In his message, Fahlman proposed to use :-) and :-( to distinguish jokes from more serious posts. Within a few months, the use of emoticons had spread, and the set of emoticons was extended with hugs and kisses, by using characters found on a typical keyboard. A decade later, emoticons have found their way into everyday digital communications and had become a paralanguage of the web [6].\nThe word \u2018emoji\u2019 literally means \u2018picture character\u2019 in Japanese. Emojis emerged in Japan at the end of the 20th century to facilitate digital communication. A number of Japanese carriers (Softbank, KDDI, DoCoMo) provided their own implementations, with incompatible encoding schemes. Emojis were first standardized in Unicode 6.0 [13]\u2014the core emoji set consisted of 722 characters. Apple\u2019s support for emojis on iPhone, in 2010, led to global popularity. An additional set of about 250 emojis was included in Unicode 7.0 [14] in 2014. Currently, as of August 2015, Unicode 8.0 [15] defines a list of 1281 single or double character emoji symbols.\nRelated work. Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, is the computational study of people\u2019s opinions, sentiments, emotions, and attitudes. It is one of the most active research areas in natural language processing and is also extensively studied in data mining, web mining, and text mining [3, 4]. The growing importance of sentiment analysis coincides with the growth of social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, book reviews, forum discussions, blogs, etc.\nThe basis of many sentiment analysis approaches are sentiment lexicons, with words and phrases classified as conveying positive or negative sentiment. Several general purpose lexicons of subjectivity and sentiment have been constructed. Most sentiment analysis research focuses on English text and, consequently, most of the resources developed (such as sentiment lexicons and corpora) are in English. One such lexical resource, explicitly devised to support sentiment classification and opinion mining, is SentiWordNet 3.0 [16]. SentiWordNet extends the well-known WordNet [17] by associating each synset with three numerical scores, describing how \u2018objective\u2019, \u2018positive\u2019, and \u2018negative\u2019 the terms in the synset are.\nEmoticons have proved crucial in automated sentiment classification of informal texts [5\u201312]. In an early work [10], a basic distinction between positive and negative emoticons has been used to automatically generate positive and negative samples of texts. These samples were then used to train and test sentiment classification models by machine learning techniques. The early results suggested that the sentiment conveyed by emoticons is domain and topic independent. In the later work, these findings have been applied to automatically construct sets of positive and negative tweets [8, 18, 19], and sets of tweets with alternative sentiment categories, such as angry and sad emotional states [11]. Such emoticon-labeled sets are then used to automatically train sentiment classifiers. Emoticons can also be exploited to extend the more common features used in text mining, such as sentiment-carrying words. A small set of emoticons has already been used as additional features for polarity classification [8, 20]. A sentiment analysis framework that takes explicitly into account the information conveyed by emoticons, is proposed in [6].\nEmojis, a new generation of emoticons, are being increasingly used in social media. Tweets, blogs and comments are analyzed to estimate the emotional attitude of a large fraction of the population\ntowards various issues. An emoji sentiment lexicon, provided as a results of this study, is a valuable resource for automated sentiment analysis. Emoji Sentiment Ranking has a format similar to SentiWordNet [16], a publicly available resource for opinion mining, used in more than 700 applications and studies so far, according to Google Scholar. In addition to a public resource, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of several aspects of the emoji sentiment. We draw a sentiment map of the 751 emojis, compare the differences between tweets with and without emojis, the differences between the more and less frequent emojis, their position in tweets, and the differences between their use in the 13 languages. Finally, a formalization of sentiment and a novel visualization in the form of a sentiment bar are given."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Emoji sentiment lexicon", "text": "Sentiment of emojis is computed from the sentiment of tweets. A large pool of tweets, in 13 European languages, was labeled for sentiment by 83 native speakers. Sentiment labels can take one of three ordered values: negative \u227a neutral \u227a positive. A sentiment label, c, is formally a discrete, 3-valued variable c \u2208 {\u22121, 0,+1}. An emoji is assigned sentiment from all the tweets in which it occurs. First, for each emoji, we form a discrete probability distribution (p\u2212, p0, p+). The sentiment score s of the emoji is then computed as the mean of the distribution. The components of the distribution: p\u2212, p0, and p+ denote negativity, neutrality, and positivity of the emoji, respectively. The probability pc is estimated from the number of occurrences, N , of the emoji in tweets with label c. Note that an emoji can occur multiple times in a single tweet, and we count all the occurrences. More detailed formalization of the sentiment representation is in the Methods section.\nWe thus form a sentiment lexicon of the 751 most frequent emojis, called Emoji Sentiment Ranking. The complete Emoji Sentiment Ranking is available as a web page at http://kt.ijs.si/data/Emoji_sentiment_ranking/. The top 10 most frequent emojis from the lexicon are in Fig 1.\nFirst we address the question whether the emojis in our lexicon are representative. We checked Emojitracker (http://emojitracker.com/), a web site which monitors the use of emojis on Twitter in real-time. In the last two years, Emojitracker has detected almost 10 billion of emojis on Twitter! From the ratio of the number of emoji occurrences and tweets in our dataset (\u223c 2.3), we estimate that there were about 4 billion tweets with emojis. In our dataset of about 70,000 tweets, we found 969 different emojis, 721 of them in common with Emojitracker.\nWe compare emojis in both sets, ordered by the number of occurrences, by Pearson\u2019s [21] and Spearman\u2019s rank [22] correlation. We successively shorten our list of emojis by cutting off the least\nfrequent emojis. The results for two thresholds, N \u2265 1 and 5, with the highest correlation coefficients, are in Table 1. Both correlation coefficients are high, significant at the 1% level, thus confirming that our list of emojis is indeed representative of the general use on Twitter. Between the two options, we decided to select the list of emojis with at least 5 occurrences, resulting in the lexicon of 751 emojis. Sentiment scores of emojis with less then 5 occurrences are not very reliable."}, {"heading": "Emoji sentiment map", "text": "Before we analyze the properties of tweets with emojis, we first discuss two visualizations of Emoji Sentiment Ranking. Fig 2 shows the overall map of the 751 emojis. The position of an emoji is determined by its sentiment score s and neutrality p0. The sentiment score s is in the range (\u22121,+1) and is computed as p+ \u2212 p\u2212. The more positive emojis are on the right hand side of the map (green), while the negative ones are on the left hand side (red). Neutral emojis (yellow) span a whole band around s = 0. Emojis are prevailingly positive, the mean sentiment score is +0.3 (see Fig 4). The bubble sizes are proportional to the number of occurrences.\nA more detailed view of some actual emojis on the map is in Fig 3. The most frequent negative emojis (panel A) are sad faces. On the other hand, the most frequent positive emojis (panel C) are not only happy faces, but also hearts, party symbols, a wrapped present, and a trophy. Even more interesting are the neutral emojis (panel B). All of them have the sentiment score around 0, but the neutrality p0 ranges between 0 and 1. The bottom two, with low p0 (face with cold sweat, crying face), are bipolar, with high negativity and positivity, where p\u2212 \u2248 p+. The middle two (flushed face, bomb) have uniform sentiment distribution, where p\u2212 \u2248 p0 \u2248 p+. The top ones, with high p0, are neutral indeed, symbolized by the yin yang symbol at the very top.\nTweets with and without emojis\nIn this subsection, we analyze the interplay of human perception of tweets with and without emojis. If we consider the sentiment of a tweet as a rough approximation of its emotional contents, we can ask two questions. Are the tweets with emojis more emotionally loaded? Does the presence of emojis in tweets have an impact on the human emotional perception of the tweets? We do not draw any causal conclusions, but report the results of two experiments which indicate that the answer to both questions is positive.\nFirst we compare all the manually labeled tweets with and without emojis. From the distribution of negative, neutral, and positive tweets in both sets, we compute the mean, standard deviation (sd), and standard error of the mean (sem). Results are in Table 2.\nWe test the null hypothesis that the two populations have equal means. We apply the Welch\u2019s t-test [23] for two samples with unequal variances and sizes. We are aware that the two populations might not be normally distributed, but the Welch\u2019s t-test is robust for skewed distributions, even more for large sample sizes [24]. With t = 87, the degrees of freedom \u226b 100 (due to large sample sizes), and the p-value \u2248 0, the null hypothesis can be rejected. We conclude, with high confidence, that the\ntweets with and without emojis have significantly different sentiment means. Additionally, tweets with emojis are significantly more positive (mean = +0.365) than tweets without emojis (mean = +0.106).\nNext, we compare the agreement of human annotators on tweets with and without emojis. Twitter sentiment classification is not an easy task and humans often disagree on sentiment labels of controversial tweets. During the process of annotation of the 1.6 million tweets, we have found that even individual annotators are not consistent with themselves. Therefore, we systematically distributed a fraction of the tweets to be annotated twice in order to estimate the level of agreement. The annotator self-agreement is a good indicator of the reliability of the annotator. The inter-annotator agreement, on the other hand, indicates the difficulty of the task. In the case of emojis, our goal is to verify if their presence correlates with higher inter-annotator agreement.\nThere are a number of measures to estimate the inter-annotator agreement. We apply three of them from two different fields, to ensure robust estimates. The first one, Krippendorff\u2019s Alpha-reliability [25] generalizes several specialized agreement measures. When annotators perfectly agree, Alpha = 1, and when the level of agreement equals the agreement by chance, Alpha = 0. We have applied an instance of Alpha which takes into account the ordering of labels and assigns higher penalty to more extreme disagreements. For example, the disagreement between the negative and\npositive sentiment is four times as costly as between the neutral and positive. The simplest measure of agreement is the joint probability of agreement, also known as Accuracy when evaluating classification models. Accuracy is the number of equally labeled tweets by different annotators, divided by the total number of tweets labeled twice. It assumes the data labels are unordered (nominal) and does not take into account the agreement by chance, but is easy to interpret.\nThe third measure comes from the field of machine learning. It is used to evaluate the performance of classification models against a test set, where the true sentiment label is known. The measure, F1(\u2212,+), is a standard measure of performance, specifically designed for 3-valued sentiment classification [12], where the negative (\u2212) and positive (+) sentiments are considered more important than the neutral one. Here we adapt it to estimate the agreement of a pair of annotators.\nTable 3 gives the results of the inter-annotator agreements on tweets with and without emojis. Coincidence matrices for both cases are in the Methods section in Tables 9 and 10, respectively. All the three measures of agreement, Alpha, Accuracy, and F1(\u2212,+) are considerably higher on tweets with emojis, for 21%, 10%, and 17%, respectively. We do not give any statistical significance results, but it seems safe to conclude that the presence of emojis has a positive impact on the emotional perception of tweets by humans. After all, this is probably the main reason why they are used in the first place."}, {"heading": "Sentiment distribution", "text": "In this subsection, we analyze the sentiment distribution of emojis with respect to the frequency of their use. The question we address is the following: Are the more frequently used emojis more emotionally loaded? First, in Fig 4 we show the sentiment distribution of the 751 emojis, regardless of\ntheir frequencies. It is evident that the sentiment score of emojis is approximately normally distributed, with mean = +0.3, prevailingly positive.\nIn Fig 5 we rank the emojis by the number of their occurrences in tweets. The sentiment score of each emoji is indicated by the color. The zoomed-in section of the first 33 emojis is in Fig 6.\nWe did not thouroughly analyze the frequency-rank distribution of the emojis. A quick analysis suggests that the data follows a power law with an exponential cutoff at rank about 200. Using maximum likelihood estimator [26], the exponent of the power law is estimated to be \u22121.3, a relatively extreme exponent. Even more relevant is the distribution of emojis on Emojitracker, but this remains a subject of further research. Here we concentrate on the sentiment distribution.\nWe define a cumulative distribution function cdf(R) of rank R over a set of ranked emojis as:\ncdf(R) = N(r \u2264 R) = \u2211\nr\u2264R\nN(r) ,\nwhere r denotes the rank of an emoji, and N(r) the number of occurrences of the emoji at rank r. In order to compare the higher ranked emojis (more frequent) with the lower ranked ones (less frequent), we define a midpoint rank R1/2, such that:\nN(1 \u2264 r \u2264 R1/2) \u2248 N(R1/2 < r \u2264 751) .\nThe midpoint rank R1/2 partitions the emojis in two subsets of approximately equal cumulative number of occurrences. In the case of Emoji Sentiment Ranking, the midpoint is at R1/2 = 23.\nWe compute the mean sentiment, sd, and sem of the more frequent and the less frequent emojis. The results are in Table 4.\nWe test the null hypothesis that the two populations of emojis have equal mean sentiment scores. Again we apply the Welch\u2019s t-test for two samples with unequal variances, but similar sizes. With t = 100, the degrees of freedom \u226b 100 (due to large sample sizes), and the p-value \u2248 0, the null hypothesis can be rejected. We can conclude, with high confidence, that the more frequent emojis are significantly more positive than the less frequent ones.\nThis result supports the thesis that the emojis, used more often, are more emotionally loaded, but we cannot draw any causal conclusion. Are they more positive because they are more often used in positive tweets, or are they more frequently used, because they are more positive?"}, {"heading": "Sentiment and emoji position", "text": "Where are emojis typically placed in tweets? Emoticons, such as :-), are used sparsely and typically at the very end of a sentence. Emojis, on the other hand, appear in groups and not only at the end of tweets. Fig 7 shows average positions of the 751 emojis in tweets. On average, an emoji is placed at 2/3 of the length of a tweet.\nFig 7 also indicates the sentiment of an emoji in relation to its position. In Fig 8 we decompose the sentiment into its three constituent components and show regression trendlines.\nThe linear regression functions in Fig 8 have the following forms:\nnegativity: p\u2212(d) = 0.20d+ 0.03 (R 2 = 0.06) ,\nneutrality: p0(d) = \u22120.41d+ 0.66 (R2 = 0.14) , positivity: p+(d) = 0.21d+ 0.30 (R 2 = 0.04) ,\nwhere d is the distance from the beginning of the tweets. The functions do not fit the data very well, but they give some useful insight. At any distance d, and for any subset of emojis, the component\nprobabilities add to 1: \u2211\nc\npc(d) = 1\nHowever, negativity and positivity increase with the distance, whereas neutrality decreases. This means that more emotionally loaded emojis, either negative or positive, tend to occur towards the end of tweets."}, {"heading": "Emojis in different languages", "text": "In the final subsection, we analyze the use of emojis in the 13 languages processed in this study. Can Emoji Sentiment Ranking be considered a universal resource, at least for the European languages? Is the sentiment ranking between different languages significantly different? Results in Table 5 indicate that the answer to the second question is negative.\nFor each language, we form a list of emojis used in the collected tweets of the language, cutoff emojis with less than 5 occurrences (the same threshold as applied to the overall Emoji Sentiment\nRanking), and compute their sentiment score. We compute the correlation coefficients between the Emoji Sentiment Ranking and individual languages. As can be seen in Table 5, the number of emojis actually used in different languages (above the threshold) drops considerably. However, their sentiment scores and ranking remain stable. Both, Pearson\u2019s correlation and Spearman\u2019s rank correlation are reasonably high, and significant for all the languages, except Albanian. This result is biased towards languages with more tweets since they have a higher share in the joint Emoji Sentiment Ranking. An alternative test might compare individual languages and Emoji Sentiment Ranking with the language removed. However, as a first approximation, it seems reasonable to use Emoji Sentiment Ranking, as a universal, language-independent resource, at least for the European languages."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper we describe the construction of an emoji sentiment lexicon, Emoji Sentiment Ranking, the first such resource openly available. We have formalized and analyzed the sentiment properties of emojis in depth, and highlighted some interesting conclusions.\nThe data which enabled these analyses, 1.6 million annotated tweets in 13 different languages, is a valuable resource with many other useful applications. In particular, we are constructing sentiment classification models for different languages, and applying them to various tasks. The Slovenian and Bulgarian language sentiment models were already applied to monitor the mood on Twitter, during political elections, in real-time [27]. The English sentiment model was used to compare the sentiment leanings of different retweet network communities towards various environmental topics [28]. A domain-specific English sentiment model (from another set of financial tweets) was applied to analyze the effects of Twitter sentiment on stock prices [29]. Yet another English sentiment model was constructed by combining a large set of general, emoticon-labeled tweets with domain-specific financial tweets, and tested for Granger causality on the Baidu stocks [30]. The same methodology of manual text annotations, automated model construction, and sentiment classification was also applied to Facebook comments in Italian, where emotional dynamics in the spreading of conspiracy theories was studied [31].\nSentiment annotation of tweets by humans is expensive. Emoticons were already used as a proxy for sentiment labels of tweets. We expect that Emoji Sentiment Ranking will turn out to be a valuable resource for helping humans during the annotation process, or even to automatically label the tweets with emojis for sentiment. In a lexicon-based approach to sentiment analysis, the emoji lexicon can be used in combination with a lexicon of sentiment bearing words. Alternatively, an emoji, with already known sentiment, can act as a seed to transfer the sentiment to the words in proximity. Such, corpus-based approach, can be used for automated corpus construction for feature generation [12], and then applied to train a sentiment classifier.\nThere are other dimensions of sentiment, beyond the one dimensional scale from negativity to positivity, worth exploring. The expressiveness of emojis allows one to assign them more subtle emotional aspects, such as anger, happiness, or sadness, and some shallow semantics, such as activities, locations, or objects of interest.\nIn the future, it will be interesting to monitor if the use of emojis is growing, and if textual communication is increasingly being replaced by a pictorial language."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Data collection", "text": "The main source of the data used in this study is a collection of tweets, in 13 European languages, collected between April 2013 and February 2015. Most of the tweets (except English) were collected during a joint project with Gama System (http://www.gama-system.si), using their PerceptionAnalytics platform (http://www.perceptionanalytics.net). The tweets of selected languages were collected through Twitter Search API, by specifying the geolocations of the largest\ncities. For English tweets, we used Twitter Streaming API (a random sample of 1% of all public tweets), and filtered out the English posts.\nWe have engaged 83 native speakers (except for English) to manually annotate for sentiment over 1.6 million of the collected tweets. The annotation process was supported by the Goldfinch platform (provided by Sowa Labs, http://www.sowalabs.com), designed specifically for sentiment annotation of short texts (such as Twitter posts, Facebook comments, ...). The annotators were instructed to label each tweet as either negative, neutral, or positive, by estimating the emotional attitude of the user who posted the tweet. They could also skip the inappropriate or irrelevant tweets. The breakdown of the annotated tweets by language is in Table 6.\nAnother source of data comes from Emojitracker (http://emojitracker.com/). Emojitracker monitors and counts the number of emojis used on Twitter in real-time. It is active since July 2013, and so far it has detected over 10 billion emoji occurrences.

Also, during the writing of this paper, in August 2015, the Unicode consortium has published a new set of emojis, the Unicode Emoji Charts (http://www.unicode.org/emoji/).\nThe set of emojis in our Emoji Sentiment Ranking follows the Unicode standard version 8 [15] and consists of all the single character symbols from the Unicode category \u2018Symbol, Other\u2019 (abbreviated [So]) that appear in our tweets. Emojitracker, on the other hand, also tracks some double character symbols (10 Country Flags, and 11 Combining Enclosing Keycaps), but does not track all the [So] symbols that appear in our data.

Formally, we represent it by a discrete, 3-valued variable, c, which denotes the sentiment class:\nc \u2208 {\u22121, 0,+1}\nThis variable models well our assumptions about the ordering of sentiment values and the distances between them.\nAn object of Twitter posts to which we attribute sentiment (an emoji in our case, but can also be a stock [29], a political party [27], a discussion topic [28, 31], . . . ) occurs in several tweets. A discrete distribution:\nN(c) , \u2211\nc\nN(c) = N , c \u2208 {\u22121, 0,+1} ,\ncaptures the sentiment distribution for the set of relevant tweets. N denotes the number of all occurrences of the object in the tweets, and N(c) the occurrences in tweets with the sentiment label c. From the above, we form a discrete probability distribution:\n(p\u2212, p0, p+) , \u2211\nc\npc = 1 .\nFor convenience, we use the following abbreviations:\np\u2212 = p(\u22121) , p0 = p(0) , p+ = p(+1) ,\nwhere p\u2212, p0, and p+ denote negativity, neutrality, and positivity, of the object (an emoji in our case), respectively.\nTypically, probabilities are estimated from relative frequencies, pc = N(c)/N . For large samples, such estimates are good approximations. Often, however, and in particular in our case, we are dealing with small samples, e.g., N = 5. In such situations, it is better to use the Laplace estimate (also known as the rule of succession) to estimate the probability [32]:\npc = N(c) + 1\nN + k , (for large N : pc \u2248\nN(c)\nN ) .\nThe constant k in the denominator is the cardinality of the class, in our case k = |c| = 3. The Laplace estimate assumes prior uniform distribution which makes sense when the sample size is small.\nOnce we have a discrete probability distribution, with properly estimated probabilities, we can compute its mean:\nx\u0304 = \u2211\nc\npc \u00b7 c .\nWe define the sentiment score, s\u0304, as the mean of the discrete probability distribution:\ns\u0304 = \u22121 \u00b7 p\u2212 + 0 \u00b7 p0 + 1 \u00b7 p+ = p+ \u2212 p\u2212 .\nSentiment score has the range: \u22121 < s\u0304 < +1. Standard deviation of a discrete probability distribution is:\nsd =\n\u221a\n\u2211\nc\npc \u00b7 (c\u2212 x\u0304)2 ,\nand standard error of the mean is: sem =\nsd\u221a N ."}, {"heading": "Sentiment bar", "text": "Sentiment bar is a useful novel visualization of the sentiment attributed to an emoji (see http://kt.ijs.si/data/Emoji_sentiment_ranking/ for examples).

Welch\u2019s t-test is also robust for skewed distributions and large sample sizes [24].\nWelch\u2019s t-test defines the t statistic as follows:\nt = x\u03041 \u2212 x\u03042 \u221a\nsd2 1 N1 + sd2 2 N2\n.\nThe degrees of freedom, \u03bd, are estimated as follows:\n\u03bd \u2248\n   \n( sd2 1\nN1 +\nsd2 2 N2 )2\nsd4 1\nN2 1 (N1\u22121)\n+ sd4 2\nN2 2 (N2\u22121)\n    ,\nwhere \u230a \u230b denotes the approximate degrees of freedom, rounded down to the nearest integer.

In our case, we want to estimate the agreement between humans when annotating the same tweets for sentiment.\nA comparison of agreements between different datasets gives some clue about how difficult the task is. There are different measures of agreement, and to get a robust estimate of the differences, we apply three well known measures.\nKrippendorff\u2019s Alpha-reliability [25] is a generalization of several specialized agreement measures. It works for any number of annotators, is applicable to different variable types and metrics (e.g., nominal, ordered, interval, . . . ), and can handle small sample sizes. Alpha is defined as follows:\nAlpha = 1\u2212 Do De ,\nwhere Do is observed disagreement between annotators, and De is disagreement, expected by chance. When annotators agree perfectly, Alpha = 1, and when the level of agreement equals the agreement by chance, Alpha = 0. The two disagreement measures are defined as follows:\nDo = 1\nN\n\u2211\nc,c\u2032\nN(c, c\u2032) \u00b7 \u03b42(c, c\u2032) ,\nDe = 1 N(N \u2212 1) \u2211\nc,c\u2032\nN(c) \u00b7N(c\u2032) \u00b7 \u03b42(c, c\u2032) .\nThe arguments, N,N(c, c\u2032), N(c), and N(c\u2032), refer to the frequencies in a coincidence matrix, defined below. \u03b4(c, c\u2032) is a difference function between the values of c and c\u2032, and depends on the metric properties of the variable. In our case, for the discrete sentiment variables c and c\u2032, the difference function \u03b4 is defined as: \u03b4(c, c\u2032) = |c\u2212 c\u2032| c, c\u2032 \u2208 {\u22121, 0,+1} . In [25], this is called the interval difference function. Note that the function attributes disagreement of 1 between the negative (or positive) and the neutral sentiment, and disagreement of 2 between the negative and positive sentiment.\nA coincidence matrix tabulates all pairable values of c from two different annotators into a k-by-k square matrix, where k = |c|. Unlike a contingency matrix (used in association and correlation statistics) which tabulates pairs of values, a coincidence matrix tabulates all pairable values. A coincidence matrix omits references to annotators. It is symmetrical around the diagonal, which contains all the perfect matches. A coincidence matrix has the following general form:\nc\u2032 \u2211\n. . . c . N(c, c\u2032) . N(c)\n. . . \u2211\nN(c\u2032) N\nHere c and c\u2032 range over all possible values of the variable. In a coincidence matrix, each labeled unit is entered twice, once as a (c, c\u2032) pair, and once as a (c\u2032, c) pair. N(c, c\u2032) is the number of units labeled by the values c and c\u2032 by different annotators, N(c) and N(c\u2032) are the totals for each value, and N is the grand total. Note that N is two times the number of units labeled by different annotators.\nIn the case of sentiment annotations, we have a 3-by-3 coincidence matrix. Two example matrices are in Tables 9 and 10. Note that both coincidence matrices in Tables 9 and 10 are symmetric around the diagonal, and that the totals N are two times larger than in Table 3 because each annotated tweet is counted twice.\nIn machine learning, a classification model is automatically constructed from training data and evaluated on a disjoint test data. A common, and the simplest, measure of performance of the model is Accuracy , which measures the agreement between the model and the test data. Here, we use the same measure to estimate the agreement between the pairs of annotators. Accuracy is defined in terms of the observed disagreement Do:\nAccuracy = 1\u2212Do = 1\nN\n\u2211\nc\nN(c, c) .\nAccuracy is simply the fraction of the diagonal elements of the coincidence matrix. Note that it does not account for the (dis)agreement by chance, nor for the ordering between the sentiment values.\nAnother, more sophisticated measure of performance, specifically designed for 3-class sentiment classifiers [12], is F1(\u2212,+):\nF1(\u2212,+) = F1(\u2212) + F1(+)\n2 .\nF1(\u2212,+) implicitly takes into account the ordering of sentiment values, by considering only the negative (\u2212) and positive (+) labels, and ignoring the middle, neutral label. In general, F1(c) (known as the F-score) is a harmonic mean of precision and recall for class c. In the case of a coincidence matrix, which is symmetric, the \u2018precision\u2019 and \u2018recall\u2019 are equal, and thus F1(c) degenerates into:\nF1(c) = N(c, c)\nN(c) .\nIn terms of the annotator agreement, F1(c) is the fraction of equally labeled tweets out of all the tweets with label c."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We acknowledge Gama System (http://www.gama-system.si) who collected most of the tweets (except English), and Sowa Labs (http://www.sowalabs.com) for providing the Goldfinch platform for sentiment annotation of tweets.

increasingly used in mobile communications and social media. In the last two years, over ten billion of emojis were used on Twitter. Emojis are Unicode graphic symbols, used as a shorthand to express concepts and ideas. In contrast to a small number of well-known emoticons which carry clear emotional contents, there are hundreds of emojis. But what is their emotional contents? We provide the first emoji sentiment lexicon, called Emoji Sentiment Ranking, and draw a sentiment map of the 751 most frequently used emojis. The sentiment of emojis is computed from the sentiment of tweets in which they occur. We have engaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European languages by the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive). About 4% of the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of emojis yields several interesting conclusions. It turns out that most of the emojis are positive, especially the most popular ones. The sentiment distribution of the tweets with and without emojis is significantly different. The inter-annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend to occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with the distance. We observe no significant differences in emoji rankings between the 13 languages, and propose our Emoji Sentiment Ranking as a European language-independent resource for automated sentiment analysis. Finally, the paper provides a formalization of sentiment and novel visualization in the form of a sentiment bar.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
