Despite their efficiency, there is still little understanding on the properties of these architectures. Deep neural networks alternate pointwise linear operators, whose coefficients are optimized with training examples, with pointwise non-linearities. To obtain good classification results, strong constraints are imposed on the network architecture on the support of these linear operators [15]. These constraints are usually derived from an experimental trial and error processes.\nSection 2 introduces a simple deep Haar scattering architecture, which only computes the sum of pairs of coefficients, and the absolute value of their difference. The architecture preserves some important properties of deep networks, while reducing the computational complexity and simplifying their mathematical analysis. Through this architecture, we shall address major questions concerning invariance properties, learning complexity, consistency, and the specialization of such architectures.\nConvolution networks are particular classes of deep networks, which compute translation invariant descriptors of signals defined over uniform grids [15, 27]. Scattering networks were introduced as convolution networks computed with iterated wavelet transforms, to obtain invariants which are stable to deformations [18]. With appropriate architecture constraints on Haar scattering networks, Section 3 defines locally displacement invariant representations of signals defined\nar X\niv :1\n50 9.\n09 18\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\non general graphs. In social, sensor or transportation networks, high dimensional data vectors are supported on a graph [28]. In most cases, propagation phenomena require to define translation invariant representations for classification. We show that an appropriate configuration of an orthogonal Haar scattering defines such a translation invariant representation on a graph. It is computed with a product of Haar wavelet transforms on the graph, and is thus closely related to nonorthogonal translation invariant scattering transforms [18].\nThe connectivity of graph data is often unknown. In social or financial networks, we typically have information on individual agents, without knowing the interactions and hence connectivity between agents. Building invariant representations on such graphs requires to estimate the graph connectivity. Such information can be inferred from unlabeled data, by analyzing the joint variability of signals defined on the unknown graph. This paper studies unsupervised learning strategies, which optimize deep network configurations, without class label information.\nMost deep neural networks are fighting the curse of dimensionality by reducing the variance of the input data with contractive non-linearities [25, 2]. The danger of such contractions is to nearly collapse together vectors which belong to different classes. Learning must preserve discriminability despite this variance reduction resulting from contractions. Hierarchical unsupervised architectures have been shown to provide efficient learning strategies [1]. We show that unsupervised learning can optimize an average discriminability by computing sparse features. Sparse unsupervised learning, which is usually NP hard, is reduced to a pair matching problem for Haar scattering. It can thus be computed with a polynomial complexity algorithm. For Haar scattering on graphs, it recovers a hierarchical connectivity of groups of vertices. Under appropriate assumptions, we prove that pairing problems avoid the curse of dimensionality. It can recover an exact connectivity with arbitrary high probability if the training size grows almost linearly with the signal dimension, as opposed to exponentially.\nHaar scattering classification architectures are numerically tested over image databases defined on uniform grids or irregular graphs, whose geometries are either known or estimated by unsupervised learning. Results are compared with state of the art unsupervised and supervised classification algorithms, applied to the same data, with known or unknown geometry.

We explain the architecture constraints and the resulting contractive properties.\nThe input network is a positive d-dimensional signal x \u2208 (R+)d , which we write S0x = x. We denote by S jx the network layer at the depth j. A deep neural network computes the next network layer by applying a linear operator H j to S jx followed by a non-linear operator. Particular deep network architectures impose that H j preserves distances, up to a constant normalization factor \u03bb [21]:\n\u2016H jy\u2212H jy\u2032\u2016= \u03bb \u2016y\u2212 y\u2032\u2016 .\nThe network is contractive if it applies a pointwise contraction \u03c1 to each value of the output vector H jS jx. This means that for any (a,b) \u2208R2 |\u03c1(a)\u2212\u03c1(b)| \u2264 |a\u2212b|. Rectifications and sigmoids are examples of such contractions. We use an absolute value \u03c1(a) = |a| because it preserves the amplitude, and it yields a permutation invariance which will be studied. For any vector y = (y(n))n, the pointwise absolute value is written |y|= (|y(n)|)n. The next network layer is thus:\nS j+1x = |H jS jx| . (1)\nThis transform is iterated up to a maximum depth J \u2264 log2(d) to compute the network output SJx. We shall further impose that each layer S jx has the same dimension as x, and hence that H j is an orthogonal operator in Rd , up to the scaling factor \u03bb . Geometrically, S j+1x is thus obtained by rotating S jx with H j, and by contracting each of its coordinate with the absolute value. The geometry of this contraction is thus defined by the choice of the operator H j which adjusts the one-dimensional directions along which the contraction is performed.\nAn orthogonal Haar scattering is implemented with an orthogonal Haar filter H j. The vector H jy regroups the coefficients of y \u2208 Rd into d/2 pairs and computes their sums and differences. The rotation H j is thus factorized into d/2 rotations by \u03c0/4 in R2, and multiplications by 21/2. The transformation of each coordinate pair (\u03b1,\u03b2 ) \u2208 R2 is:\n(\u03b1,\u03b2 ) \u2212\u2192 (\u03b1 +\u03b2 , \u03b1\u2212\u03b2 ).\nThe operator |H j| applies an absolute value to each output coordinate, which has no effect on \u03b1 +\u03b2 if \u03b1 \u2265 0 and \u03b2 \u2265 0, but it removes the sign of their difference:\n(\u03b1,\u03b2 ) \u2212\u2192 (\u03b1 +\u03b2 , |\u03b1\u2212\u03b2 |) . (2)\nObserve that this non-linear operator defines a permutation invariant representation of (\u03b1,\u03b2 ). Indeed, the output values are not modified by a permutation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 , and the two values of \u03b1 , \u03b2 are recovered without order, by\nmax(\u03b1,\u03b2 ) = 1 2 ( \u03b1 +\u03b2 + |\u03b1\u2212\u03b2 | ) and min(\u03b1,\u03b2 ) = 1 2 ( \u03b1 +\u03b2 \u2212|\u03b1\u2212\u03b2 | ) . (3)\nThe operator |H j| can thus also be interpreted as a calculation of d/2 permutation invariant representations of pairs of coefficients.\nApplying |H j| to S jx computes the next layer S j+1x = |H jS jx|, obtained by regrouping the coefficients of S jx \u2208 Rd\ninto d/2 pairs of indices written \u03c0 j = {\u03c0 j(2n),\u03c0 j(2n+1)}0\u2264n<d/2:\nS j+1x(2n) = S jx(\u03c0 j(2n))+S jx(\u03c0 j(2n+1)) , (4)\nS j+1x(2n+1) = |S jx(\u03c0 j(2n))\u2212S jx(\u03c0 j(2n+1))| . (5)\nThe pairing \u03c0 j specifies which index \u03c0 j(2n+1) is paired with \u03c0 j(2n), but the ordering index n is not important. It specifies the storing position in S j+1x of the transformed values. For classification applications, \u03c0 j will be optimized with training examples. This deep network computation is illustrated in Figure 1. The network output SJx is calculated with Jd/2 additions, subtractions and absolute values. Each coefficient of SJx is calculated by cascading J permutation invariant operators over pairs, and thus defines an invariant over a group of 2J coefficients. The network depth J thus corresponds to an invariance scale 2J .\nSince the network is computed by iterating orthogonal linear operators, up to a normalization, and a contractive absolute value, the following theorem proves that it defines a contractive transform, which preserves the norm, up to a normalization. It also proves that an orthogonal Haar scattering transform SJx is obtained by applying an orthogonal matrix to x, which depends upon x and J.\nTheorem 2.1. For any J \u2265 0, and any (x,x\u2032) \u2208 R2d\n\u2016SJx\u2212SJx\u2032\u2016 \u2264 2J/2\u2016x\u2212 x\u2032\u2016 . (6)\nMoreover SJx = 2J/2 Mx,J x where Mx,J is an orthogonal matrix which depends on x and J, and\n\u2016SJx\u2016= 2J/2\u2016x\u2016 . (7)\nProof. Since S j+1x = |H jS jx| where H j is an orthogonal operator multiplied by 21/2,\n\u2016S j+1x\u2212S j+1x\u2032\u2016 \u2264 \u2016H jS jx\u2212H jS jx\u2032\u2016= 21/2\u2016S jx\u2212S jx\u2032\u2016.\nSince S0x = x, equation (6) is verified by induction on j. We can also rewrite\nS j+1x = |H jS jx|= E j,xH jx,\nwhere E j,x is a diagonal matrix where the diagonal entries are \u00b11, with a sign which depend on S jx. Since 2\u22121/2H j is orthogonal, 2\u22121/2E j,xH j is also orthogonal so Mx,J = 2\u2212J/2 \u220fJj=1 E j,xH j is orthogonal, and depends on x and J. It results that \u2016SJx\u2016= 2J/2 \u2016x\u2016."}, {"heading": "2.2 Complete representation with bagging", "text": "A single Haar scattering transform looses information since it applies orthogonal operators followed by an absolute value which looses the information of the sign. However, the following theorem proves that x can be recovered from 2J distinct orthogonal Haar scattering transforms, computed with different pairings \u03c0 j at each layer.\nTheorem 2.2. There exist 2J different orthogonal Haar scattering transforms such that almost all x \u2208 Rd can be reconstructed from the coefficients of these 2J transforms.\nThis theorem is proved by observing that a Haar scattering transform is computed with permutation invariants operators over pairs. Inverting these operators allows to recover values of signal pairs but not their locations. However, recombining these values on enough overlapping sets allows one to recover their locations and hence the original signal x. This is proved on the following lemma applied to interlaced pairings. We say that two pairings \u03c00 = {\u03c00(2n),\u03c00(2n+1)}0\u2264n<d/2 and \u03c01 = {\u03c01(2n),\u03c01(2n+ 1)}0\u2264n<d/2 are interlaced if there exists no strict subset \u2126 of {1, ...,d} such that \u03c00 and \u03c01 are pairing elements within \u2126. The following lemma shows that a single-layer scattering operator is invertible with two interlaced pairings.\nLemma 2.1. If two pairings \u03c00 and \u03c01 of {1, ...,d} are interlaced then any x \u2208 Rd whose coordinates have more than 2 different values can be recovered from the values of S1x computed with \u03c00 and the values of S1x computed with \u03c01.\nProof. Let us consider a triplet n1,n2,n3 where (n1,n2) is a pair in \u03c00 and (n1,n3) is a pair in \u03c01. From S1x computed with \u03c00 we get\nx(n1)+ x(n2), |x(n1)\u2212 x(n2)|\nand we saw in (3) that it determines the values of {x(n1),x(n2)} up to a permutations. Similarly, {x(n1),x(n3)} are determined up to a permutation by S1x computed with \u03c01. Then unless x(n1) 6= x(n2) and x(n2) = x(n3) the three values x(n1),x(n2),x(n3) are recovered. The interlacing condition implies that \u03c01 pairs n2 to an index n4 which can not be n3 or n1. Thus, the four values of x(n1),x(n2),x(n3),x(x4) are specified unless x(n4) = x(n1) 6= x(n2) = x(n3). This interlacing argument can be used to extend to {1, . . . ,d} the set of all indices ni for which x(ni) is specified, unless x takes only two values.\nProof of Theorem 2.2. Suppose that the 2J Haar scatterings are associated to the J hierarchical pairings (\u03c0\u03b511 , ...,\u03c0 \u03b5J J ) where \u03b5 j \u2208 {0,1}, where for each j, \u03c00j and \u03c01j are two interlaced pairings of d elements. The sequence (\u03b51, ...,\u03b5J) is a binary vector taking 2J different values.\nThe constraint on the signal x is that each of the intermediate scattering coefficients takes more than 2 distinct values, which holds for x \u2208 Rd except for a union of hyperplanes which has zero measure. Thus for almost every x \u2208 Rd , the theorem follows from applying Lemma 2.1 recursively to the j-th level scattering coefficients for J\u22121\u2265 j \u2265 0.\nLemma 2.1 proves that only two pairings is sufficient to invert one Haar scattering layer. The argument proving that 2J pairings are sufficient to invert J layers is quite brute-force. It is conjectured that the number of pairings needed to obtain a complete representation for almost all x \u2208 Rd does not need to grow exponentially in J but rather linearly. Theorem 2.2 suggests to define a signal representations by aggregating different Haar orthogonal scattering transforms. We shall see that this bagging strategy is indeed improving classification accuracy."}, {"heading": "2.3 Sparse unsupervised learning with adaptive contractions", "text": "A free orthogonal Haar scattering transform of depth J is computed with a pairing at each of the J network layers, which may be chosen freely. We now explain how to optimize these pairings from N unlabeled examples {xi}1\u2264i\u2264N . As previously explained, an orthogonal Haar scattering is strongly contractive. Each linear Haar operator rotates the signal space, and the absolute value suppresses the sign of each difference, and hence projects coefficients over a smaller domain. Optimizing the network thus amounts to find the best directions along which to perform the space compression.\nContractions reduce the space volume and hence the variance of scattering vectors but it may also collapse together examples which belong to different classes. To maximize the \u201caverage discriminability\u201d among signal examples, we shall thus maximize the variance of the scattering transform over the training set. Following [19], we show that it yields a representation whose coefficients are sparsely excited.\nThe network layers are optimized with a greedy layerwise strategy similar to many deep unsupervised learning algorithms [9, 2], which consists in optimizing the network parameters layer per layer, as the depth j increases. Let us suppose that Haar scattering operators H` are computed for 1\u2264 ` < j. One can thus compute S jx for any x \u2208 Rd . We now explain how to optimize H j to maximize the variance of the next layer S j+1x. The non-normalized empirical variance of S j over the training set {xi}i is\n\u03c32(S jx) = \u2211 i \u2016S jxi\u20162\u2212 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2211 i S jxi \u2225\u2225\u22252 .\nThe following proposition, adapted from [19], proves that the scattering variance decreases as the depth increases, up to a factor 2. It gives a condition on H j to maximize the variance of the next layer.\nProposition 2.1. For any j \u2265 0 and x \u2208 Rd , \u03c32(2\u2212( j+1)/2S j+1x) \u2264 \u03c32(2\u2212 j/2S jx). Maximizing \u03c32(S j+1x) given S jx is equivalent to finding H j which minimizes\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2211\ni H jS jxi \u2225\u2225\u22252 = \u2211 n ( \u2211 i |H jS jxi(n)| )2 . (8)\nProof. Since S j+1x = |H jS jx| and \u2016H jS jx\u2016= 21/2\u2016S jx\u2016, we have\n\u03c32(S j+1x) = \u2211 i \u2016S j+1xi\u20162\u2212 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2211 i S j+1xi \u2225\u2225\u22252\n= 2 N\n\u2211 i=1 \u2016S jxi\u20162\u2212 \u2225\u2225\u2225 N\u2211 i=1 |H jS jxi| \u2225\u2225\u22252. Optimizing \u03c32(S j+1x) is thus equivalent to minimizing (8).

Because of the contraction of the absolute value,\nit proves that the variance of the normalized scattering 2\u2212 j/2S jx decreases as j increases. Moreover the maximization of \u03c32(S j+1x) amounts to minimize a mixed l1 and l2 norm on H jS jxi(n), where the sparsity l1 norm is along the realization index i where as the l2 norm is along the feature index n of the scattering vector.\nMinimizing the first l1 norm for n fixed tends to produce a coefficient indexed by n which is sparsely excited across the examples indexed by i. It implies that this feature is discriminative among all examples. On the contrary, the l2 norm along the index n has a tendency to produce l1 sparsity norms which have a uniformly small amplitude. The resulting \u201cfeatures\u201d indexed by n are thus uniformly sparse.\nBecause H j preserves the norm, the total energy of coefficients is conserved:\n\u2211 n \u2211 i |H jS jxi(n)|2 = 2\u2211 i \u2016S jxi\u20162.\nIt results that a sparse representation along the index i implies that H jS jxi(n) is also sparse along n. The same type of result is thus obtained by replacing the mixed l1 and l2 norm (8) by a simpler l1 sparsity norm along both the i and n variables\n\u2211 n \u2211 i |H jS jxi(n)| . (9)\nThis sparsity norm is often used by sparse autoencoders for unsupervised learning of deep networks [2]. Numerical results in Section 4 verify that both norms have very close classification performances.\nFor Haar operators H j, the l1 norm leads to a simpler interpretation of the result. Indeed a Haar filtering is defined by a pairing \u03c0 j of d integers {1, ...,d}. Optimizing H j amounts to optimize \u03c0 j, and hence minimize\n\u2211 n \u2211 i |H jS jxi(n)|= \u2211 n\n( S jxi(\u03c0 j(2n))+S jxi(\u03c0 j(2n+1))+ |S jxi(\u03c0 j(2n))\u2212S jxi(\u03c0 j(2n+1))| ) .\nBut \u2211n(S jx(\u03c0 j(2n))+S jx(\u03c0 j(2n+1))) = \u2211n S jx(n) does not depend upon the pairing \u03c0 j. Minimizing the l1 norm (9) is thus equivalent to minimizing\n\u2211 n \u2211 i |S jxi(\u03c0 j(2n))\u2212S jxi(\u03c0 j(2n+1))|. (10)\nIt minimizes the average variation within pairs, and thus tries to regroup pairs having close values. Finding a linear operator H j which minimizes (8) or (9) is a \u201cdictionary learning\u201d problem which is in general an NP hard problem. For a Haar dictionary, we show that it is equivalent to a pair matching problem and can thus be solved with O(d3) operations. For both optimization norms, it amounts to finding a pairing \u03c0 j which minimizes an additive cost\nC(\u03c0 j) = \u2211 n C(\u03c0 j(2n),\u03c0 j(2n+1)), (11)\nwhere C(\u03c0 j(2n),\u03c0 j(2n+1)) = \u2211i |H jS jxi(n)| for (9) and C(\u03c0 j(2n),\u03c0 j(2n+1)) = ( \u2211i |H jS jxi(n)| )2 for (8). This linear pairing cost is minimized exactly by the Blossom algorithm with O(d3) operations. Greedy method obtains a 1/2- approximation in O(d2) time [24]. Randomized approximation similar to [12] could also be adapted to achieve a complexity of O(d logd) for very large size problems.\nTheorem 2.2 proves that several Haar scattering transforms are necessary to obtain a complete signal representation. We learn T Haar scattering transforms by dividing the training set {xi}i in T non-overlapping subsets. A different Haar scattering transform is optimized for each training subset. Next section describes a supervised classifier applied to the resulting bag of T Haar scattering transforms."}, {"heading": "2.4 Supervised feature selection and classification", "text": "Strong invariants are computed by the supervised classifier which essentially computes adapted linear combinations of Haar scattering coefficients. Bagging T orthogonal Haar scattering representations defines a set of T d scattering coefficients.

The final supervised classification is implemented\nwith a Gaussian kernel SVM classifier applied to this reduced set of coefficients. We select K scattering coefficient to discriminate each class c from all other classes, and decorrelate these features before applying the SVM classifier. Discriminating a class c from all other classes amounts to approximating the indicator function\nfc(x) = { 1 if x belongs to class c 0 otherwise .\nLet us denote by \u03a6x = {\u03c6px}p\u2264T d the dictionary of T d scattering coefficients to which is added the constant \u03c60x = 1. An orthogonal least square linearly approximates fc(x) with a sparse subset of K scattering coefficients {\u03c6pk}k\u2264K which are greedily selected one at a time. To avoid correlations between selected features, it includes a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization which decorrelates the scattering dictionary relatively to previously selected features.

The Euclidean norm of this vector is normalized to 1. In the applications of Section 4, M is set to 103 and hence remains large. Since the feature vectors lies on a high-dimensional unit sphere, the standard deviation \u03c3 of the Gaussian kernel SVM must be of the order of 1. Indeed, a Gaussian kernel SVM performs its classification by fitting separating hyperplane over different balls of radius of radius \u03c3 . If \u03c3 1 then the number balls covering the unit sphere grows like \u03c3\u2212M . Since M is large, \u03c3 must remain in the order of 1 to insure that there are enough training samples to fit a hyperplane in each ball."}, {"heading": "3 Orthogonal Haar Scattering on Graphs", "text": "Signals such as images are sampled on uniform grids. Many classification problems are translation invariant, which motivates the calculation of translation invariant representations. A translation invariant representation can be computed\nby averaging signal samples, but it removes too much information. Wavelet scattering operators [18] are calculated by cascading wavelet transforms and absolute values. Each wavelet transform computes multiscale signal variations on the grid. It yields a large vector of coefficients, whose spatial averaging defines a rich set of translation invariant coefficients.\nData vectors may be defined on non-uniform graphs [28], for example in social, financial or transportation networks. A graph displacement moves data samples on the grid but is not equivalent to a uniform grid translation. Orthogonal Haar scattering transforms on graphs are computed from local multiscale signal variations on the graph. The calculation of displacement invariant features is left to the final supervised classifier, which adapts the averaging to the classification problem. Section 3.1 introduces this Har scattering on a graph as a particular case of orthogonal Haar scattering. Section 3.3 proves that an orthogonal Haar scattering on graphs can be written as a product of wavelet transforms, as usual wavelet scattering operators.

(15)\nApplying these equation for j \u2264 J defines a structured Haar network illustrated in Figure 2. If we remove the absolute value from (15) then these equations iterate linear Haar filters and define an orthogonal Walsh transform [6]. The absolute value completely modifies the properties of this transform but Section 3.3 proves that it can be still be written as a product of orthogonal Haar wavelet transforms, alternating with absolute value non-linearities.\nThe following proposition proves that this structured Haar scattering is a transformation on a hierarchical grouping of the graph vertices, derived from the row pairing (13).

The coefficients {SJx(n,q)}0\u2264q<2 j are computed by applying a Hadamard matrix to the restriction of x to VJ,n. This Hadamard matrix depends on x, J and n.\nProof. Theorem 2.1 proves that {SJx(n,q)}0\u2264q<2J is computed by applying am orthogonal transform to x. To prove that it is a Hadamard matrix, it is sufficient to show that its entries are \u00b11. We verify by induction on j \u2264 J that S jx(n,q) only depends on restriction of x to Vj,n, by applying (15) and (14) together with (16). We also verify that each x(v) for v \u2208Vj,n appears exactly once in the calculation, with an addition or a subtraction. Because of the absolute value, the addition or subtraction which are 1 and \u22121 in the Hadamard matrix, which therefore depends upon x, J and n\nAn orthogonal Haar scattering on a graph can thus be interpreted as an adaptive Hadamard transform over groups of vertices, which outputs positive coefficients. Walsh matrices are particular cases of Hadamard matrices. The induction (16) defines sets Vj,n with connected nodes in the graph if for all j and n, each pair (\u03c0 j(2n),\u03c0 j(2n+1)) regroups two sets Vj,\u03c0 j(2n) and Vj,\u03c0 j(2n+1) which are connected. It means that at least one element of Vj,\u03c0 j(2n) is connected to one element of Vj,\u03c0 j(2n+1). There are many possible connected dyadic partitions of any given graph. Figure 3(a,b) shows two different examples of connected graph partitions.\nFor images sampled on a square grid, a pixel is connected with 8 neighbors. A structured Haar scattering can be computed by pairing neighbor image pixels, alternatively along rows and columns as the depth j increases. When j is even, each Vj,n is then a square group of 2 j pixels, as illustrated in Figure 3(c). Shifting such a partition defines a new partition. Neighbor pixels can also be grouped in the diagonal direction which amounts to rotate the sets Vj,n by \u03c0/4 to\ndefine a new dyadic partition.

(17)\nThere are ( j\nm\n) 2\u2212 jd coefficients of order m in S jx.\nProof. This proposition is proved by induction on j. For j = 0 all coefficients are of order 0 since S0x(n,0) = x(n). If S jx(n,q) is of order m then (14) and (15) imply that S j+1x(n,2q) is of order m and S j+1x(n,2q+1) is of order m+1. It results that (17) is valid for j+1 if is valid for j.\nThe number of coefficients S jx(n,q) of order m corresponds to the number of choices for q and hence for 0 \u2264 j1 < ... < jm < j, which is ( j m ) . This must be multiplied by the number of indices n which is 2\u2212 jd.\nThe amplitude of scattering coefficients typically decreases exponentially when the scattering order m increases, because of the contraction produced by the absolute value. High order scattering coefficients can thus be neglected. This is illustrated by considering a vector x of independent Gaussian random variables of variance 1. The value of S jx(n,q) only depends upon the values of x in Vj,n. Since Vj,n does not intersect with Vj,n\u2032 if n 6= n\u2032, we derive that S j(n,q) and S j(n\u2032,q) are independent. They have same mean and same variance because x is identically distributed. Scattering coefficients are iteratively computed by adding pairs of such coefficients, or by computing the absolute value of their difference. Adding two independent random variables multiplies their variance by 2. Subtracting two independent random variables of same mean and variance yields a new random variable whose mean is zero and whose variance is multiplied by 2. Taking the absolute value reduces the variance by a factor which depends upon its probability distribution. If this distribution is Gaussian then this factor is 1\u22122/\u03c0 . If we suppose that this distribution remains approximately Gaussian, then applying m absolute values reduces the variance by approximately (1\u2212 2/\u03c0)m. Since there are (J m ) coefficients of order m, their\ntotal normalized variance \u03c32m,J is approximated by (J m ) (1\u2212 2/\u03c0)m. Table 1 shows that (J m ) (1\u2212 2/\u03c0)m is indeed of the same order of magnitude as the value \u03c32m,J computed numerically. This variance becomes much smaller for m > 4. This observation remains valid for large classes of signals x.

The consistency of this pairing algorithm is studied over particular Gaussian stationary processes, and we show that there is no curse of dimensionality.\nSection 2.3 introduces two criteria to optimize the pairing \u03c0 j of a free orthogonal Haar scattering, from a training set {xi}i\u2264N .

To guarantee that this pairing finds connected sets we must make sure that the total variation minimization favors regrouping neighborhood points, which means that x has some form of regularity on the graph. We also need N to be sufficiently large so that this minimization finds connected sets with high probability, despite statistical fluctuations. Avoiding the curse of dimensionality means that N should not grow exponentially with the signal dimension d.\nTo attack this problem mathematically, we consider a very particular case, where signals are defined on a ring graph, and are thus d periodic. Two indices n and n\u2032 are connected if |n\u2212 n\u2032| = 1 mod d. We study the optimization of the first network layer for j = 0, where S0x(n,q) = x(n).

The stationarity implies that its covariance matrix Cov(x(n),x(m)) = \u03a3(n,m) depends on the distance between points \u03a3(n,m) = \u03c1((n\u2212m) mod d). The average regularity depends upon the decay of the correlation \u03c1(u). We denote by \u2016\u03a3\u2016op the sup operator norm of \u03a3. The following theorem proves that the training size N must grow like d logd in order to compute an optimal pairing with a high probability.

The gray level image gives the probability that a pairing is connected when computing this pairing by minimizing the total variation (22), as a function of the dimension d and of the number N of training samples. The black and white points correspond to probabilities 0 and 1 respectively. In this example, we see that the optimization gives a connected pairing with probability 1\u2212\u03b5 for N increasing almost linearly with d, which is illustrated by the nearly straight line of dotted points corresponding to \u03b5 = 0.2. The Theorem gives an upper bound which grows like d logd, though the constant involved is not tight.\nFor layer j > 1, S jx(n,q) is no longer a Gaussian random vector due to the absolute value non-linearity. However, the result can be extended using a Talagrand-type concentration argument instead of the Gaussian concentration. Numerical experiments presented in Section 4 show that this approach does recover the connectivity of high dimensional images with a probability close to 100% for j \u2264 3, and that the probability decreases as j increases.

For orthogonal Haar scattering, all reported errors were calculated with an unsupervised learning which minimizes the l1 norm (9) of scattering coefficients, layer per play. As expected, Table 2 shows that minimizing a mixed l1 and l2 norm (8) yields nearly the same results on all data bases."}, {"heading": "4.4 Images on a graph over a sphere", "text": "A data basis of irregularly sampled images on a sphere is provided in [4]. It is constructed by projecting the MNIST image digits on d = 4096 points randomly sampled on the 3D sphere, and by randomly rotating these images on the sphere. The random rotation is either uniformly distributed on the sphere or restricted with a smaller variance (small rotations) [4]. The digit \u20189\u2019 is removed from the data set because it can not be distinguished from a \u20186\u2019 after rotation. Examples sphere digits are shown in Figure 11. This geometry of points on the sphere can be described by a graph which connects points having a sufficiently small distance on the sphere.\nThe classification algorithms introduced in [4] take advantage of the known distribution of points on the sphere, with a representation based on the graph Laplacian. Table 3 gives the results reported in [4], with a fully connected neural network, and with a spectral graph Laplacian network.\nAs opposed to these algorithms, the unsupervised structured Haar scattering algorithm does not use this geometric information and learns the graph information by pairing. Computations are performed on a scrambled set of signal values. Haar scattering transforms are calculated up to the maximum scale 2J = d = 212. A total of T = 10 connected dyadic partitions are estimated by unsupervised learning, and the classification is performed from M = 103 selected coefficients. Although the graph geometry is unknown, the structured Haar scattering reduces the error rate both for small and large 3D random rotations.\nIn this case a free orthogonal Haar scattering has a smaller error rate than a structured Haar scattering for small rotations, but a larger error for large rotations. It illustrates the tradeoff between the structural bias and the feature variance in the choice of the algorithms. For small rotation, the variability within classes is smaller and a free scattering can take advantage of more degrees of freedom. For large rotations, the variance is too large and dominates the problem.\nTwo points of the sphere of radius 1 are considered to be connected if their geodesic distance is smaller than 0.1. With this convention, over the 4096 points, each point has on average 8 connected neighbors. The unsupervised Haar learning\nperforms a hierachical pairing of points on the sphere. For small and large rotations, the percentage of connected sets Vj,n remains above 90% for 1\u2264 j \u2264 4. This is computed over 70% of the points points having a nonneglegible energy. It shows that the multiscale geometry on the sphere is well estimated by hierachical pairings."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "This work was supported by the ERC grant InvariantClass 320959."}, {"heading": "A Proof of Theorem 3.1", "text": "Proof of Theorem 3.1.

With slight abuse of notation, denote by v = \u03c0(u) if two nodes u and v are paired by \u03c0 , then we have\n\u2202 f \u2202 zi(v\u2032) = 1\u221a dN \u2211(u,v)\u2208\u03c0 Sgn(xi(u)\u2212 xi(v)) \u2202 \u2202 zi(v\u2032) (xi(u)\u2212 xi(v))\n= 1\u221a dN\nd\n\u2211 u=1\nSgn(xi(u)\u2212 xi(\u03c0(u))) \u2202\n\u2202 zi(v\u2032) xi(u)\n= 1\u221a dN\nd\n\u2211 u=1 Sgn(xi(u)\u2212 xi(\u03c0(u)))(\u03a31/2d )u,v\u2032\n= 1\u221a dN (\u03a31/2d Si)(v \u2032),\nwhere Si := (Sgn(xi(u)\u2212 xi(\u03c0(u))))du=1 is a vector of length d whose entries are \u00b11.

Since the pairing has a probability larger than 1\u2212 \u03b5 to be connected if Pr[\u03c0\u2217 /\u2208 \u03a0(0)d ] < \u03b5 , we need to show that under the inequality (24) the probability Pr[\u03c0\n\u2217 /\u2208 \u03a0(0)d ] is less than \u03b5 .

For any \u03c0 \u2208\u03a0 (m) d , suppose that there are ml pairs in \u03c0 so that the distance between the two paired nodes is l, m1 = d/2\u2212m, m2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+md/2 = m.

By applying this in the final bound in the theorem, the constant in front of\nlogd is 2 instead of 3. The constant of the theorem is not tight, while the O(d logd) is believed to be the tight order as d increases.\nTo proceed, define the function\ng(x) =\u2212C\u03c1 N d \u00b7 x2 +(2logd) \u00b7 x, 1\u2264 x\u2264 d 2 ,\nand observe that max1\u2264x\u2264d/2 g(x) = g(1) whenever\nlogd C\u03c1 N/d < 1,\nwhich holds as long as Eq.
